S.C. House Votes To Remove Flag
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- On the day that South Carolina celebrated its first
official Confederate Memorial Day, members of the state House voted Wednesday to
remove the Confederate flag from atop the Statehouse dome. The Senate already
has approved a similar measure to remove the flag and put one up at a monument
on the Statehouse grounds. Democratic Gov. Jim Hodges has said he supports
removal. Lawmakers debated late into Wednesday night, with supporters of the
bill pleading with their fellow House members to approve the plan. The bill
passed 63-56. A procedural vote will be held Thursday before it goes back to the
Senate, which has to agree on minor differences in the two versions.

Los Alamos Evacuated for Fire

<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- A blaze that had been set to clear brush but raged
out of control over the weekend spread into Los Alamos and burned homes
Wednesday, forcing the evacuation of all 11,000 residents in this town, the site
of America's most storied nuclear laboratory. With wind gusts up to 50 mph
driving the flames through ponderosa pine, police, sheriff's and fire department
officials went door to door, urging people to pack up and get out as quickly as
possible. Smoke from the fire rose 20,000 feet above the ground.

   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Thousands of refugees poured into Freetown on
Wednesday as pro-government troops rushed to key towns near Sierra Leone's
steamy seaside capital to prepare for a feared rebel attack. U.N. peacekeepers,
the Sierra Leone army and pro-government militia fighters were consolidating
their forces along the road into the capital from Waterloo, 15 miles away, where

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Saying the penalty would far exceed the antitrust
violations a federal judge found the company to have committed, Microsoft on
Wednesday asked a judge to throw out the Justice Department's plan to break up
the company. Microsoft offered its own remedies to correct what U.S. District
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled last month was illegal anticompetitive
behavior. The company said it was willing to stop displaying the desktop icon in
its Windows operating system that leads users to its Web browser, Internet
Explorer.

warnings that they break open at ''alarmingly high'' rates. Giving its first
formal approval of the long-sold implants, the Food and Drug Administration
allowed the products to continue selling as long as women are fully informed

<HEADLINE> Franks, Gormley given slight edge in U.S. Senate primary field  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The Republican field in the race for U.S.
Senate remains too close to call, according to a new poll by
Quinnipiac College.
</P>
<P>
   The poll suggests that U.S. Rep. Bob Franks and state Sen. Bill
Gormley are out in front, but their lead over Essex County
executive James Treffinger and Ramapo College professor Murray
Sabrin is so small it pretty much falls within the poll's margin of
error.
</P>
<P>
   The poll gives Franks 18 percent and Gormley 14 percent among
residents who say they are registered Republicans. Treffinger was
supported by 8 percent and Sabrin by 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign chiefs for Franks and Gormley had little quarrel with
the poll outcome, agreeing that the race is wide open and voter
recognition of the candidates so far is minimal.
</P>
<P>
   Quinnipiac surveyed 311 residents who identified themselves as
registered Republicans. It has an error margin of 5.6 percentage
points, which means when the error margin is factored in to any of
the returns, most of the candidates can be said to be running dead
even.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, while Franks, R-Berkeley Heights, was ahead of
Gormley by 4 percentage points, Gormley's 14 percent support could
actually be as high as 19 percent while Franks' 18 percent support
could actually be as low as 13 percent, in effect reversing their
position.
</P>
<P>
   The big leader on the poll returns is Mr. Undecided, which is
how 46 percent of the registered Republicans responded to the poll.
Quinnipiac political analyst Scott McLean said the vast field of
undecided voters shows that all of the candidates have small bases
of support, however loyal, and the potential to gain 15 or 20
percent of the undecided voters in time for a win June 6.
</P>
<P>
   None of the Republican candidates has broadcast TV commercials
yet, and none moved much from the poll results seen in late March.
</P>
<P>
   Along with questions asking how they would vote now, Republican
voters who were surveyed were asked if they recognized and had
favorable or unfavorable views of the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Franks had the highest recognition of the field with 16 percent
regarding him as favorable, a result vastly overshadowed by the
fact that 65 percent said they had no opinion of him.
</P>
<P>
   Sabrin, running as an outsider from the mainstream state
Republican Party, had the highest degree of anonymity -- 80 percent
had no opinion of him -- despite the fact that he had run for
governor as a Libertarian in 1997 and got 114,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Franks campaign chief Charlie Smith said the polls have
consistently showed Franks in front despite any adjustment for
error margins.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously all of the campaigns have some work to do, but let's
not forget this is a multi-candidate field in which the winner
ultimately may win with less than 50 percent of the vote,'' Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gormley campaign manager David Murray said the race is even,
adding, ''Nothing's changed for months.'' He said the undecided
vote is probably closer to 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not unreasonable to say that two out of three
Republicans who will come out on June 6 are not yet focused on the
campaign, and don't know what they are going to do on June 6,''
Murray said. ''I think the poll is right in saying the race is
ill-defined.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray discounted Franks' lead in support from county GOP
organizations. ''An organization is not going to let voters know
who he is or what he is going to do for them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith said the Gormley campaign, by focusing on negative
attacks against Franks, has shown that it believes their candidate
is trailing.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Shaftan, Sabrin's spokesman, said he thinks the lead that
Franks and Gormley have will ''get bigger before it gets smaller.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to come on in the last 10 days. The other
candidates are going to say their message and people will see that
there's one conservative in the race,'' Shaftan said.
</P>
<P>
   A phone messages left with the Treffinger campaign office was
not returned Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> S.C. House Votes To Remove Flag  </HEADLINE>
By LEIGH STROPE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- On the day that South Carolina celebrated
its first official Confederate Memorial Day, members of the state
House voted Wednesday to remove the Confederate flag from atop the
Capitol dome.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate already has approved a similar measure to remove the
flag and put one up at a monument on the Statehouse grounds.
Democratic Gov. Jim Hodges supports removal.
</P>
<P>
   ''The House faced a choice today -- leave the flag flying or move
it from the dome to a place of historical context on the Statehouse
grounds,'' he said. ''With tonight's vote, we are one giant step
closer to ending the flag debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers debated late into Wednesday night, with supporters of
the bill pleading with their fellow House members to approve the
plan. The bill passed 63-56. A procedural vote will be held
Thursday before it goes back to the Senate, which has to agree on
minor differences in the two versions.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina is the only state that flies the Confederate flag
above its Statehouse, and the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People has been leading a tourism boycott of
the state until the flag is removed.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan approved Wednesday, the dome flag would come down
and a Confederate battle flag would be installed at a Confederate
soldier monument on the Statehouse grounds July 1.
</P>
<P>
   In an odd coalition, hard-core flag supporters and members of
the House Black Caucus tried to derail the bill. Supporters wanted
to kill the bill to keep the flag atop the dome, while many black
legislators didn't want a new flag put at the monument located at
one of Columbia's busiest intersections. They and the NAACP say it
would be in too prominent a place.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately it's not over,'' said House Minority Leader
Gilda Cobb-Hunter, who is black. ''It's over for me, but I don't
think it's over for the state.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue was emotional for many lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those who voted for the bill were doing that as statesmen and
as people that wanted to resolve the issue,'' said House Majority
Rick Quinn, a Republican flag supporter who cried after casting his
vote for removal.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-controlled House made few changes to the Senate
bill. It increased the height of the flag pole at the monument from
20 feet to 30 feet, added lighting and a fence, and specified the
flag size as a 52-inch by 52-inch square.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, someone vandalized the Confederate soldier
monument, spray painting the words ''take it down, don't put it
here'' in red on the granite base. No immediate arrests were made.
</P>
<P>
   At midday on the Statehouse lawn, flag protesters ignited
Confederate and Nazi flags. The Confederate flag, like the Nazi
emblem, ''represents crimes against humanity,'' said Kevin Gray of
the Harriett Tubman Read Street Freedom House Project in Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters shouted ''no compromise.'' But the Confederate
flag did not immediately ignite, and its supporters chanted back
''it won't burn.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are up here trying to bring people together,'' said Hodges'
spokesman, Morton Brilliant. ''It's unfortunate that extremists on
both sides of this issue are trying to drive people further
apart.''
</P>
<P>
   The Confederate flag was raised above the Statehouse in 1962 to
commemorate the Civil War centennial, though critics suggest it was
also a gesture of defiance toward the civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say it is an important part of the state's heritage;
opponents say it represents slavery and racism.
</P>
<P>
   Many state employees got the day off for South Carolina's first
permanent holiday to recognize Confederate Memorial Day. It was
authorized by a bill signed last week that also created a permanent
Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday in February.

<HEADLINE> Astros 5, Rockies 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) - Shane Reynolds won his fifth consecutive decision
and the Houston Astros won a series at Enron Field for the first
time with a 5-1 victory over Colorado on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds (5-0) pitched seven innings and allowed one run on four
hits and two walks. Jay Powell and Billy Wagner pitched an inning
each, with Wagner allowing a hit to complete a five-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch Meluskey and Jeff Bagwell homered for the Astros, who
dropped their first four series at the new ballpark before taking
two of three from the Rockies. The Astros are 5-10 at Enron Field,
where 54 homers have already been hit, compared to 118 all last
season at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell hit his 10th homer in the third, giving the Astros a 4-0
lead off Masato Yoshii (1-4), who pitched 5 2-3 innings and allowed
five runs on seven hits and two walks. He struck out seven.
</P>
<P>
   Meluskey's two-run homer in the second put Houston ahead 3-0.
Meluskey's fourth homer of the season also scored Richard Hidalgo,
who walked. Hidalgo later singled home a run in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Cedeno and Craig Biggio had back-to-back triples in the
first, giving the Astros a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies ended Reynolds' shutout bid in the seventh when
Jeffrey Hammonds tripled and scored on a sacrifice fly by Terry
Shumpert.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Larry Walker had two of the Rockies' five hits, a double
and a triple. ... Colorado third baseman Jeff Cirillo went 0-for-4,
snapping a 15-game hitting streak. He is batting .444 (12-for-27)
since April 30. ... Rockies manager Buddy Bell has 199 wins as a
major league manager. ... Since April 26, Bagwell is hitting .245
(13-for-53). ... The Rockies will not play at Enron Field again
this year and haven't won a season series in Houston since 1993.

<HEADLINE> Police, Falun Gong Members Clash  </HEADLINE>
By CHARLES HUTZLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Followers of the banned Falun Gong sect honored
the birthday of their movement's founder Thursday, protesting by
the dozens in Tiananmen Square only to meet swift and sometimes
forceful arrest by Chinese police.
</P>
<P>
   Followers tried to unfurl banners and raise their arms in a
meditation pose used by the group. Plainclothes police darted
across the vast plaza to quell the separate acts of civil
disobedience by small groups of sect members. Police vans raced
back and forth to pick up the captured.
</P>
<P>
   At least 50 people were taken away within about 90 minutes.
Tourists, taken aback by the frenzy on the normally crowded but
peaceful square, watched the protests. At least two Western
tourists were detained, apparently for taking pictures.
</P>
<P>
   The scene resembled the confrontation on April 25, when
followers gathered for the first anniversary of a 10,000-person
demonstration. The earlier protest had shocked China's leaders and
three months later they banned Falun Gong as a public menace and
threat to Communist Party rule.
</P>
<P>
   Followers insist that Falun Gong promotes health and good
citizenship. Falun Gong, also known as Falun Dafa, is a blend of
slow-motion exercises, Buddhist and Taoist philosophy and the often
unorthodox ideas of Li Hongzhi, an ex-government grain clerk who
founded the group in 1992 and now lives in New York.
</P>
<P>
   By the traditional lunar calendar once used in China and much of
Asia, Thursday marked the anniversary of the birth of the Gautama
Siddhartha, the founder of Buddhism. To Falun Gong followers, it is
Li's birthday too. China claims Li was born on July 7, 1952, but
changed his records in 1994 to build up his mystique.
</P>
<P>
   In the 9{ months since the group was banned, dozens of principal
organizers have been convicted and human rights groups say
thousands have been sent to labor camps without trial. Yet Falun
Gong followers have staged protests nearly every day, embarrassing
police who have been ordered to quash the sect.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the public defiance, the government claimed victory anew
over the group Thursday. In an editorial carried in national
newspapers, the official Xinhua News Agency claimed that 98 percent
of all Falun Gong followers had severed ties to the group.

<HEADLINE> Grand Canyon Blaze Becomes Wildfire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK, Ariz. (AP) -- Authorities evacuated
and closed part of Grand Canyon National Park on Wednesday as high
winds drove a prescribed fire out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Park spokeswoman Vanya Chavez said the blaze was reclassified as
a wildfire Tuesday night after high winds fanned the flames into a
larger, more serious fire the size of which had yet to be
determined.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez said all visitors and nonessential personnel in the
developed part of the park's north rim -- 200 to 300 people -- were
evacuated Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was one of two ignited April 25 that were intended to
improve ecology while material that could feed a wildfire. Both
fires were in mixed conifer forests. They covered about 500 acres
of the planned 1,500 before one blew out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters said the flames were relatively low despite the
high winds and didn't threaten the developed area.
</P>
<P>
   The fires don't affect the park's main visitor entrance and
development on the South Rim or the park's eastern entrance, park
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The North Rim opened May 1 on a limited basis and other
facilities were to open Friday. The area will remain closed until
the fire is contained.

<HEADLINE> Expos Closer Urbina To Undergo MRI  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Montreal Expos closer Ugueth Urbina missed
Wednesday night's 8-0 loss to the Philadelphia Phillies after
feeling pain in his right elbow while warming up the previous
night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last night, he threw a pitch and felt something,'' Expos
manager Felipe Alou said.
</P>
<P>
   Urbina, last year's NL saves leader with 41, told team officials
about the pain following the Expos' 3-2 win Tuesday night. X-rays
of the elbow were taken on Wednesday and an MRI will be performed
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He struck out the side while recording his eighth save in his
last outing, Sunday at Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he has pitched twice in the last 10 days,'' Alou said.
''He has been underpitched. He has 13 innings so far; that's very
low. And he has been very effective. He has 22 strikeouts in 13
innings, so the stuff has been there.''
</P>
<P>
   Urbina, 26, had bone chips removed from his right elbow in
December 1996 after experiencing pain while pitching in his native
Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   The injury is the latest of a series that have plagued the
Expos' bullpen this season.
</P>
<P>
   Graeme Lloyd, signed as a free agent be to Montreal's set man,
hasn't pitched this season. He had arthroscopic surgery on his left
shoulder May 4 and won't return for at least three months.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Strickland, the Expos' current setup man, is on the
disabled list because of right shoulder tendinitis.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll see what transpires with Ugie but the fact that right
now, we're not talking about pitching, we're talking about an MRI,
and we have the guy who was supposed to be our setup guy out, too,
so changes will have to take place,'' Alou said. ''Rearrangement of
the pitching staff will have to take place.''
</P>
<P>
   One option is moving staff ace Dustin Hermanson into the
closer's role.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love the job of closing but it's not the way that I wanted
to get a closing job,'' Hermanson said. ''Ugie's such a good,
aggressive pitcher. It's a big loss to the team if he is out for a
while, but we've got to do whatever we've got to do to win games.
And whatever they need me to do, I just want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Acquired from Florida just before the beginning of the 1997
season, Hermanson was converted into a starter with Montreal. He
responded with a 14-11, 3.13 ERA season in 1998 and led the staff
with 34 starts last season, despite going 9-14 with a 4.20 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Hermanson, who had no saves in 34 relief appearances with San
Diego from 1995-96, saved 21 games for Triple-A Las Vegas in 1996.
He has made 99 career starts, all with the Expos, and is 3-3 with a
4.81 ERA this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've always been groomed as a closer,'' Hermanson said.
''Plus, my mentality when I'm out there is a closer's mentality.
I'll do whatever the team wants me to do.''

<HEADLINE> Groups urge adoption of profiles for health care workers  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A coalition of groups is accusing the state
Medical Society of jamming progress on a bill to require the
release of more information about health professionals, especially
medical malpractice histories.
</P>
<P>
   The groups Wednesday urged the state Senate to follow through on
promises to institute the physician ''profiles'' before the state
Legislature's regular session ends in the next five or six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Profiles should include information about a professional's
education, experience, history of settlements and jury verdicts and
other disciplinary matters, the advocates said. It would be
available over the Internet, according to plans in the state
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Among those promoting the profiles were the New York Public
Interest Research Group, the Center for Medical Consumers, the
Statewide Senior Action Council, and Best Friends, a group formed
to counsel the parents of children who die as the result of medical
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ''The more that they (legislators) horse around ... the more
they protect the doctors, the more people are going to die,'' said
Caren Catinella of Best Friends.
</P>
<P>
   The groups said they favor New York adopting a physician
disclosure law like Massachusetts', which, they said, has
contributed to less litigation against medical professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ''The number of (malpractice) lawsuits go down because the
patients appreciate not being jerked around,'' Blair Horner of the
New York Public Interest Research Group said. ''The revenge motive
is not so great as when people are being stonewalled.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Senate Health Committee, Republican Kemp
Hannon of Nassau County, has been negotiating with the Medical
Society and the Assembly over resolving differences in the
profiling legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Hannon said those involved in the talks are waiting to see if
Gov. George Pataki will propose legislation, or at least indicate
his preferences for such a measure.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am highly hopeful because I don't see such a degree of
difference among the parties that with good will can't be easily
resolved,'' Hannon said Wednesday. ''They aren't ideological
differences.''
</P>
<P>
   One stumbling block is over how many medical malpractice
verdicts or settlements must be completed against a doctor before
they are listed in a profile. The Medical Society said three within
the past 10 years should trigger disclosure, though spokesman
Michael Murphy said one or two might also warrant disclosure if
they are ''relevant'' to the competence of the doctor or safety of
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Hannon said that information must also be put into perspective
for medical consumers. A family practitioner, for instance, may
well have no malpractice actions against him while an obstetrician
who performs more high-risk practices may have several, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Medical Society does not believe the size of verdicts
against doctors in medical malpractice cases has a relationship to
the culpability of the doctors and would not favor using the size
of awards in a profile, Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   The physicians' group also favors listing any serious
misdemeanor or felony convictions against doctors, regardless of
their relevance to their jobs, in profiles, according to Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, people can get information about state disciplinary
actions against doctors through the state Health Department and
some limited information about doctors' schooling from the state
Education Department. It is harder to find information about other
health care professionals such as pharmacists.
</P>
<P>
   The groups Wednesday also released a survey of more than 700 New
Yorkers they paid the Zogby International polling firm to conduct.
Eighty-two percent of those surveyed said they strongly agreed and
12 percent said they somewhat agreed that consumers should have
''easy access'' to background information about a physician,
including medical malpractice and disciplinary histories.

<HEADLINE> Clinton plans to press ahead with campaign  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- While New York's political community
attempts to digest the latest turn of events in the life of her
Senate rival, Hillary Rodham Clinton says she's going ahead with
business as usual on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just going to keep doing what I've been doing,'' the first
lady said Wednesday following an event at the Syracuse Hebrew Day
School. ''I'm going to keep talking about the issues and ideas that
I think matter to the lives of New Yorkers ... because this is an
important campaign about the future of the children and families of
the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments came after Senate rival Rudolph Giuliani
announced that he and his wife, Donna Hanover, were discussing a
marriage separation.
</P>
<P>
   It was the latest bombshell from the New York City mayor in the
past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the mayor confirmed that a woman he has been seen
with regularly in recent months, Judith Nathan, was his ''very good
friend.'' A week earlier, the mayor said he had treatable prostate
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the mayor's announcement of separation discussions,
Clinton said, ''I don't have anything to say.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady has lived through her own marital strife,
including her husband's public disclosure that he had a sexual
relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton said that she and the mayor had had ''a short but
very cordial exchange'' in St. Patrick's Cathedral on Monday when
they attended the funeral mass of Cardinal John O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told him I was praying for him,'' the first lady said. ''I
think all of us are hoping for the best for him.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, however, Clinton ducked a question about whether
she would like to see the mayor stay in the Senate race, waving off
the query with ''I'm on my way'' as she walked away from reporters
covering her appearance at the day school.
</P>
<P>
   At the school, Clinton said the anniversary of Israeli Freedom
Day was ''a happy celebration.'' She spoke to about 150 students,
teachers and parents.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, the first lady addressed a convention at
Crouse Hospital of more than 250 nurses who are members of the
Service Employees International Union.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told the nurses that she was participating in Sunday's
Million Mom March in Washington against gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a public health problem,'' Clinton said of gun violence.
''And those of you who are on the front lines, you know the health
problem.''

<HEADLINE> Police Arrest Falun Gong Followers  </HEADLINE>
By CHARLES HUTZLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Followers of the banned Falun Gong sect honored
the birthday of their movement's founder Thursday, protesting by
the dozens in Tiananmen Square only to meet swift and sometimes
forceful arrest by Chinese police.
</P>
<P>
   Followers tried to unfurl banners and raise their arms in a
meditation pose used by the group. Plainclothes police darted
across the vast plaza to quell the separate acts of civil
disobedience by small groups of sect members. Police vans raced
back and forth to pick up the captured.
</P>
<P>
   At least 50 people were taken away within about 90 minutes.
Tourists, taken aback by the frenzy on the normally crowded but
peaceful square, watched the protests. At least two Western
tourists were detained, apparently for taking pictures.
</P>
<P>
   The scene resembled the confrontation on April 25, when
followers gathered for the first anniversary of a 10,000-person
demonstration. The earlier protest had shocked China's leaders and
three months later they banned Falun Gong as a public menace and
threat to Communist Party rule.
</P>
<P>
   Followers insist that Falun Gong promotes health and good
citizenship. Falun Gong, also known as Falun Dafa, is a blend of
slow-motion exercises, Buddhist and Taoist philosophy and the often
unorthodox ideas of Li Hongzhi, an ex-government grain clerk who
founded the group in 1992 and now lives in New York.
</P>
<P>
   By the traditional lunar calendar once used in China and much of
Asia, Thursday marked the anniversary of the birth of the Gautama
Siddhartha, the founder of Buddhism. To Falun Gong followers, it is
Li's birthday too. China claims Li was born on July 7, 1952, but
changed his records in 1994 to build up his mystique.
</P>
<P>
   In the 9{ months since the group was banned, dozens of principal
organizers have been convicted and human rights groups say
thousands have been sent to labor camps without trial. Yet Falun
Gong followers have staged protests nearly every day, embarrassing
police who have been ordered to quash the sect.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the public defiance, the government claimed victory anew
over the group Thursday. In an editorial carried in national
newspapers, the official Xinhua News Agency claimed that 98 percent
of all Falun Gong followers had severed ties to the group.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone Ready for Attack  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDRA ZAVIS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Pro-government troops rushed to
key towns near Freetown to prepare for an expected rebel offensive
as thousands of frightened villagers poured into the steamy seaside
capital.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. peacekeepers, Sierra Leone's army and pro-government
militia fighters were consolidating their forces along the road
into the capital from Waterloo, 15 miles away, where fleeing
residents said they heard the sound of gunfire Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''Waterloo is now the front line,'' said Joseph Jalloh, an army
commander.
</P>
<P>
   He said the government expected an attack there by forces of the
rebel Revolutionary United Front. The rebels -- who killed thousands
during a civil war that ended last July -- have thrown the nation's
peace process into jeopardy, taking U.N. peacekeepers hostage,
clashing with pro-government forces and shooting civilian
protesters in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   The massing of pro-government forces followed a night of
sporadic gunfire in three locations within 50 miles of the capital,
a U.N. official said. It was unclear whether the developments
foreshadowed an impending rebel offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling the apprehension was the mystery of rebel leader Foday
Sankoh's whereabouts. He disappeared Monday after his bodyguards
shot and killed at least four demonstrators outside his home.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said peacekeepers were
taking up defensive positions to prepare for possible fighting.
''We hope that it's not going to come to a pitched battle, but in a
sense we're preparing for one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fighters loyal to former military ruler Johnny Paul Koroma sped
to Waterloo on Wednesday. An aide to Koroma said President Ahmed
Tejan Kabbah had authorized Koroma's forces to defend Freetown. The
aide, Prince Nicol, dismissed any defensive tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ''The U.N. still insists their mandate is not to fight. We are
not waiting for them,'' Nicol said.
</P>
<P>
   Passing government forces as they rushed from Freetown were
thousands of Sierra Leoneans arriving by foot, car and truck in the
capital, fearful of a spread of the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the rebels ''came, it happened like this. We were
not going to wait for them,'' said Rominus Conteh, sitting on a
bundle filled with the few possessions he could carry. Conteh said
he and his family had fled a refugee camp in Waterloo after hearing
gunfire Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Bintou Bomeh, a pregnant 18-year-old with a cloth bundle
containing some shriveled onions atop her head, said the gunshots
near Masiaka on Monday forced her to leave home. ''I'm frightened
now,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In their eight-year campaign to oust Kabbah's government before
signing a power-sharing agreement in July, the rebels mutilated and
dismembered their victims by the thousands. Limbless men, women and
children -- some fitted with prostheses, most not -- are a frequent
sight here.
</P>
<P>
   The situation in Sierra Leone has become increasingly chaotic
since a Nigerian-led regional intervention force -- which had been
in the country along with U.N. peacekeepers to enforce July's peace
agreement -- pulled out last week. Since then, clashes have broken
out intermittently between peacekeepers and rebels. Some 500
peacekeepers are being held hostage by the RUF. At least one
peacekeeper is believed to be dead.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has said the U.S. Air Force is prepared to fly in a
battalion of U.N. peacekeepers from Bangladesh -- roughly 700 to 800
soldiers -- in coming days. The United Nations wants to speed up
deployment of that battalion and two others scheduled to arrive by
mid-July, bringing the U.N. force up to its full strength of
11,100.
</P>
<P>
   Canada said Wednesday it was sending a plane to help ferry 1,800
Indian and Bangladeshi peacekeepers to the West African nation. In
London, British Defense Minister Geoff Hoon said British troops
would defend Freetown's airport but would not join the U.N. force
to quell any rebel threat. Hoon told the British Broadcasting Corp.
the soldiers would only guard the airport to allow evacuation of
British nationals and the reinforcement of the U.N. peacekeeping
force.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials have said the peacekeepers in Sierra Leone are
not a well-honed fighting force. On Wednesday, Secretary-General
Kofi Annan chastised powerful members states for not sending their
better-trained forces to assist the embattled mission.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Leone is among the world's poorest countries despite vast
diamond resources. In principle, the rebels and Sankoh were
included in the power-sharing deal that ended the civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Wednesday if the United Nations had been duped by Sankoh,
the U.N. special representative to Sierra Leone, Oluyemi Adeniji,
said ''that is a conclusion that you may reach now.''

<HEADLINE> India, Pakistan Show Nuke Restraint  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT NEUMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The muted rumble that heaved plumes of
dust into the air in a remote patch of Indian desert two years ago
also sent political shock waves around the world.
</P>
<P>
   With its nuclear weapons tests on May 11, 1998, India became an
uninvited member of an elite club of nations that had openly
wielded the bomb. By the end of the same month, India's rival
Pakistan had also knocked loudly on the clubhouse door with its own
underground nuclear explosions.
</P>
<P>
   But the consensus among defense and disarmament analysts is that
a full-blown nuclear arms race in South Asia has yet to
materialize. Despite bitter tensions over the disputed territory of
Kashmir, which nearly pushed India and Pakistan into a fourth war
last year, the two countries ''have not moved very far or in any
significant fashion'' to field nuclear weapons, said Stephen Cohen,
a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, a former State Department official and presidential
adviser on South Asian affairs, said technical difficulties,
disagreements over control of the weapons, inadequate early warning
systems and political considerations all may have slowed the
deployment of nuclear-armed air and missile forces.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both countries have very weak command-and-control structures
when it comes to nuclear weapons and also fairly bad intelligence
generally,'' he said. ''I think there are very strong military
incentives not to deploy to a hair-trigger stance.''
</P>
<P>
   There also is the issue of control. In India, a centralized
command under the civilian government will almost certainly call
the shots, Cohen said. In smaller Pakistan, however, fears that
military and political structures would be overwhelmed in a first
strike could lead to the delegation of authority to local
commanders -- a potentially dangerous scenario given the possibility
of false warnings and the extremely limited response time.
</P>
<P>
   During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union
enjoyed the luxury of as much as an hour to verify a nuclear
strike, but because of missile flight times between targets in
India and Pakistan, ''these guys have only about three minutes or
30 seconds,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   For safety reasons, the region's delivery systems -- aircraft and
missiles -- are most likely being kept in different locations than
the bombs themselves, said P.R. Chari, the director of the New
Delhi-based Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies.
</P>
<P>
   ''But of course, they could be brought together very quickly,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Both nations have ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear
weapons, but many analysts believe Indian and Pakistani scientists
are still struggling to produce suitable nuclear warheads for them
-- a more complex task than simply building a Hiroshima-type bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the moment, we are talking only about air-dropped
weapons,'' said A. Nayyar, a physicist at Islamabad's Qaid-e-Azam
University. ''Although the weapon-makers have said that nuclear
warheads have been mated with missiles, it seems unlikely at this
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said in the case of India, ''there's no evidence of a
functioning missile delivery force. It's still largely on paper and
several years down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Following India's 1998 nuclear test -- its first since 1974 -- the
United States moved quickly to condemn the action and lobbied hard
to prevent Pakistan from following suit.
</P>
<P>
   But since the explosions, political factors have played a key
role in restraining an unbridled exuberance for deployment,
especially in India. Having become ''deeply engaged'' with
Washington, New Delhi has probably decided ''it's worth going slow
on weapons development'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   India has pledged ''no first use'' and says it wants only enough
weapons for a ''minimum deterrence'' against a possible Pakistani
or Chinese first strike. Pakistan has declined to rule out first
use and says it needs the bomb to offset India's superior nuclear
and conventional forces.
</P>
<P>
   Both have steadfastly refused to sign the Nuclear
Nonproliferation Treaty, designed to limit the spread of nuclear
weapons. At the United Nations, where the treaty is under review,
Undersecretary-General for Disarmament Jayantha Dhanapala expressed
hope that if the two countries haven't yet deployed that ''in this
interim period ... the international community can have an effect
on these decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   But the situation may be only a small window of opportunity for
mature nuclear states to usher India and Pakistan safely into their
club. With relations between the two antagonists at their worst in
decades, fighting in Kashmir threatens to ignite wider hostilities.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody's going to wake up and say 'Let's go nuke 'em,'''
cautions George Perkovich, director of the Secure World Program at
the W. Alton Jones Foundation and author of ''India's Nuclear
Bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   ''What you have to worry about is that they have another kind of
conflict and it escalates,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Teacher Talks of Scandal  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE ZIEGLER DIZON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Five years ago, Jerry Plecki's phone rang nearly
incessantly. He couldn't eat. He couldn't sleep. And he wouldn't
answer the one question on everyone's mind: ''Why?''
</P>
<P>
   Plecki, the coach of a group of high school students caught
cheating its way to the state title in an academic competition,
left town to escape the frenzy. But now, as HBO prepares to air a
movie on the scandal, he's talking -- about the Chicago public
schools, his students and the decision to cheat.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are no moral absolutes on this given topic,'' Plecki
told The Associated Press on Wednesday in his first interview since
the 1995 Illinois Academic Decathlon scandal broke.
</P>
<P>
   Plecki, an English teacher at Steinmetz High School, helped his
team cram from a stolen copy of the test, then shared in their
glory as they beat a rival Chicago magnet school that had won the
previous nine years.
</P>
<P>
   But the team's score was too good -- 9,400 points more than it
had scored at regionals. The second-place school, Whitney Young,
asked for a review, and decathlon officials determined the jump was
too great to be normal. They asked Steinmetz to take a ''validation
test,'' then stripped the team of its title when members refused.
</P>
<P>
   After a few team members broke down and admitted to cheating,
Plecki resigned.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a horrible experience,'' Plecki said. ''But I'm an
adult, and I can handle it. What was more horrible to me was how
the media at the time turned the lives of these kids upside-down.''
</P>
<P>
   The former teacher, now a businessman in the Chicago area, looks
distinctly uncomfortable as he rehashes the scandal. He says he
agreed to consult on the HBO movie ''Cheaters'' and talk publicly
only to give the matter some closure.
</P>
<P>
   Plecki offers no apologies for his actions, nor does he defend
them. He instead asks, ''What if? What if it were you?''
</P>
<P>
   Plecki contends his team, all bright and high-scoring students,
had no chance to win in a public system that puts most of its
resources into a few magnet schools for elite students. Steinmetz
is in a blue-collar neighborhood, and Plecki said many team members
were from low-income, single-parent families and spoke English as a
second language.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney Young not only had the best teachers and more money than
Steinmetz, it had working bathrooms and the system's belief that
its students were the cream of the crop, Plecki said.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago schools officials declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   But Constantine Kiamos, Steinmetz's principal for the past 16
years, disputed the idea that there was no way for his school to
win without cheating.
</P>
<P>
   ''Out of a high school of 2,300, I certainly can find 10 or 12
great kids,'' Kiamos said.
</P>
<P>
   The principal said there's no gray area to what Plecki did -- it
was simply wrong. Steinmetz has not competed in the academic
decathlon since.
</P>
<P>
   ''He taught them to cheat. That is unacceptable,'' Kiamos said.
</P>
<P>
   Jolie Fitch, a student on Plecki's tight-knit team, disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   Fitch, now 21 and working in a department store, is portrayed in
''Cheaters'' as the group's leader, the ultra-smart student who
wanted to show up Whitney Young at any cost. She says the students
decided as a group to use the stolen test and that Plecki did not
push them into any decision.
</P>
<P>
   She contends Steinmetz could have won without cheating -- the
team had to figure out the answers for the stolen test on its own --
but needed the extra boost of confidence the test provided.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't regret what I did. I learned a lot from it,'' Fitch
said. ''If I had to do it all over again, the only thing I would
change is getting caught.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitch, portrayed by Jena Malone, is the only student whose real
name is used in ''Cheaters,'' set to air May 20. Jeff Daniels takes
on the role of Plecki, while Paul Sorvino plays Kiamos.
</P>
<P>
   Director John Stockwell said his goal was to present an
''unflinching look'' at the scandal through the eyes of the people
lost in the frenzy: the students and their teacher.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is not a defense of cheating, Stockwell said, but
rather a way to highlight ''the hypocrisy in some of the platitudes
that we always spout.''
</P>
<P>
   Stockwell said he pursued Plecki for months before the teacher
agreed to talk. Plecki said he was paid for his help but declined
to discuss the amount.
</P>
<P>
   The former teacher said he misses teaching but is trying to move
on from the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not obsessed with this. I think about it often,'' Plecki
said. ''My hope is that everybody associated with it continues to
prosper.''

<HEADLINE> German Candidate Said Anti-Immigrant  </HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISERLOHN, Germany (AP) -- Applause mingles with the scent of
bratwurst in front of the ornate town hall as the conservative
candidate for governor shouts a simple message to a crowd of
supporters: German jobs should go to Germans.
</P>
<P>
   Juergen Ruettgers' anti-immigration slogans in North
Rhine-Westphalia won't turn the tide in state elections this
Sunday, polls predict, leaving Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's
Social Democrats in control of Germany's most populous state.
</P>
<P>
   But the campaign has shown that the Christian Democrats are
ready to fight and spark national debate after a slush fund scandal
centered on ex-Chancellor Helmut Kohl sent the party's reputation
plunging.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is what has become known as the ''Kinder statt Inder''
campaign -- German for ''children, not Indians'' and an attack on
Schroeder's drive to bring in 20,000 foreign computer experts to
fill a shortage in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Democrats and Ruettgers argue jobless Germans
should be retrained instead.
</P>
<P>
   ''Does anyone really believe they would stay only temporarily?''
Ruettgers told a crowd of 200 during a recent rally in this
struggling industrial town. ''When they come, their families will
come too.''
</P>
<P>
   Claiming it's ''deeply immoral'' for Germany to drain poor
countries of their best and brightest, he adds: ''I believe those
jobs should first of all be given to Germans.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruettgers denies being anti-foreigner, saying he is pointing out
gaps in the state education system and the need to care for those
Germans left behind by economic change.
</P>
<P>
   But while the local Social Democrats seem to have survived a
recent sleaze scandal of their own, Ruettgers is battling not only
the furor set off by Kohl but also charges of racism.
</P>
<P>
   Despite grabbing national headlines, Ruettgers has failed to
revive the momentum of last fall when his party won a string of
state elections and swept city councils in North Rhine-Westphalia.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign has a model. A drive against relaxed citizenship
rules won Hesse state for the Christian Democrats last year.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, even the new party leaders have been lukewarm
about rhetoric that prompted the Social Democrats to compare
Ruettgers to Joerg Haider, the Austrian far-right leader criticized
for his past comments praising aspects of the Nazi regime.
</P>
<P>
   North Rhine-Westphalia, a former coal and steel region in
western Germany that is now home to many high-tech and media
businesses, has been firmly in Social Democratic hands for 34
years.
</P>
<P>
   Defeat here, considered possible before the Christian Democrats
sank into scandal last December, would be a huge blow to Schroeder
and his coalition with the small Greens party.
</P>
<P>
   The same alliance governs North Rhine-Westphalia, headed by
incumbent Gov. Wolfgang Clement, 59, a business-friendly
technocrat.
</P>
<P>
   Ruettgers, 48, is straining to persuade voters that he stands
for a fresh start -- even though he served as Kohl's education
minister.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, newspapers headlined unconfirmed reports that
Bonn prosecutors had found enough evidence to charge Kohl with
breach of trust for his role in the scandal. The Christian
Democrats accused prosecutors of leaking information to the media.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl sparked the scandal by admitting he took $1 million in
secret -- and thus illegal -- donations for his party while
chancellor in the 1990s. Many conservative voters aren't ready to
forgive yet.
</P>
<P>
   Anemone Kemper, a teacher put off by Ruettgers' choice of words,
said she would probably vote for the Free Democrats, a small
pro-business party trying to get back into the state legislature
after a five-year absence.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Christian Democrats' slogans are idiotic, of course,'' she
said on the quaintly refurbished Iserlohn town square. ''But the
basic idea of filling jobs with our own people is OK.''

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Faces Long Flood Recovery  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE COHEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   XAI-XAI, Mozambique (AP) -- Sitting in his aging pickup truck,
Jose Santini stared at the 2-month-old river that has cut his
hometown in two.
</P>
<P>
   He had been hoping -- though without much conviction -- that work
would have begun on restoring the main road, which floods from the
overflowing Limpopo River had cut off on both ends of the low-lying
area of Xai-Xai -- turning it into an island.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fixing the road is the most important thing,'' Santini said.
''Without it, we cannot begin to rebuild.''
</P>
<P>
   The floods killed at least 700 people and destroyed the homes or
jobs of an estimated 2 million more. Other nations pledged more
than $450 million at a donor conference in Rome earlier this month,
but reconstruction efforts are expected to take years.
</P>
<P>
   Santini had watched from his first-floor apartment two months
before as the river surged through streets and buildings, tearing
concrete benches from the sidewalk and dumping a gasoline tanker in
a ditch. The river has subsided, but left behind a new tributary.
</P>
<P>
   Rubber boats shuttle people back and forth. Only a single
asphalt strip is passable by car. The other streets were turned
into shallow gullies.
</P>
<P>
   Xai-Xai's sidewalks are strewn with rubbish and the ruined
possessions of the town's residents. Outside the remains of the
bank, someone has painstakingly laid out soaked lumps of illegible
records. Further down stands the remains of the central market.
</P>
<P>
   Most residents who were evacuated to the higher areas of Xai-Xai
during the floods have stayed there, returning occasionally by boat
to try to salvage a few belongings.
</P>
<P>
   In some areas, there are signs of progress in restoring basic
services. The town of Chokwe, which was badly hit by a surge of
water on Feb. 27, has been cleaned up, and its 40,000 residents
have returned to start rebuilding their lives.
</P>
<P>
   But in other places there appears little sense of urgency.
Nowhere is this more evident than on the EN-1, the main north-south
road and a vital artery for transporting goods and distributing aid
to flood victims.
</P>
<P>
   Badly damaged in the floods, the road has had makeshift repairs
that enabled it to be reopened a few weeks after the rivers
receded. But little has been done since then, and light rains near
the southern town of Chibuto recently turned a dirt section of the
road into a muddy swamp, stranding thousands of people en route to
the capital, Maputo.
</P>
<P>
   On the road leading to Xai-Xai, the provincial capital of the
southern Gaza province, construction of a metal bridge spanning an
offshoot of the Limpopo River had ground to a halt, despite the
construction materials stacked next to the road.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the work had stopped, workers simply shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, vast tracts of land elsewhere remain under water and
thousands of people are unable to return home.
</P>
<P>
   The influx of foreign aid money will provide an immediate boost
for the economy and the government's coffers, but the flood victims
-- predominantly peasant farmers who are being given seed and
agricultural implements -- will have to wait some time before they
start earning an income again.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. World Food Program plans to feed 600,000 people until
the end of September, when they expect harvesting to resume.
</P>
<P>
   Arminda Mahlanga of Chokwe has spent weeks sleeping on the
ground, having lost everything she owned in the floods. ''I can't
get my stuff back, because I am not working,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Santini, a restaurateur who estimates he lost $60,000 in the
floods, said Mozambicans were worse off during the 17-year civil
war that followed independence from Portugal in 1975 and claimed
600,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
   ''The floods are just another disaster,'' he said.

S.C. House Votes To Remove Confederate Flag
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Members of the South Carolina state House voted
Wednesday to remove the Confederate flag from atop the Statehouse dome. The
Senate already has approved a similar measure to remove the flag and put one up
at a monument on the Statehouse grounds. Democratic Gov. Jim Hodges has said he
supports removal. Lawmakers debated late into Wednesday night, with supporters
of the bill pleading with their fellow House members to approve the plan. The
bill passed 63-56. A procedural vote will be held Thursday before it goes back
to the Senate, which has to agree on minor differences in the two versions.

   BEIJING (AP) -- Followers of the banned Falun Gong sect honored the birthday
of their movement's founder Thursday, protesting by the dozens in Tiananmen
Square only to meet swift and sometimes forceful arrest by Chinese police.
Followers tried to unfurl banners and raise their arms in a meditation pose used
by the group. Plainclothes police darted across the vast plaza to quell the
separate acts of civil disobedience by small groups of sect members. Police vans
raced back and forth to pick up the captured. At least 50 people were taken away
within about 90 minutes.

Dozens were injured. The cause of the fire was unknown, said Salvadoran Defense
Minister Gen. Juan Martinez Varela. Rescue workers extinguished the fire and

of America's most storied nuclear laboratory. With wind gusts up to 50 mph

<HEADLINE> Giuliani announces he and wife are moving toward legal separation  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and his wife Donna
Hanover are moving toward legal separation, confirming
long-standing speculation that the two have a troubled marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very, very painful,'' Giuliani said at a news conference
Wednesday. ''For quite some time, it's probably been apparent that
Donna and I lead, in most ways, independent and separate lives.
It's been a very painful road and I hope we'll be able to formalize
that in an agreement that protects our children, that gives them
all the security and protection that they deserve. That is
something that we have to work out (and that) we have to strive
for.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time Giuliani, 55, has confirmed that his
marriage with Hanover, 50, a television personality and actress, is
strained. The couple have two children, Andrew, 14, and Caroline,
10.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure caps a bizarre two week period for the mayor, who
guards his privacy zealously but has recently been forced to make a
series of public announcements about exceedingly personal matters.
</P>
<P>
   First, on April 27, Giuliani announced he had been diagnosed
with treatable prostate cancer and said it could affect his run for
the Senate. Then, on May 3, he acknowledged that Judith Nathan, a
45-year-old divorcee with whom he has been seen around town, was a
''very good friend'' but refused to further characterize the
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Republican mayor, who is running for the U.S.
Senate against first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, said his
disclosure has nothing to do with politics and that he does not
expect his announcement to harm him politically.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't really care about politics right now,'' he said. ''I'm
thinking about my family, the people that I love and what can be
done that's honest and truthful and that protects them the best.
... Politics comes at least second, maybe third, maybe fourth,
somewhere else at least.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ''It will all work itself out some way politically.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Wednesday, Giuliani appeared at a campaign fund-raiser at
a private home in suburban Westchester County, a key demographic in
the Senate race. His aides said the campaign is ''all systems go.''
</P>
<P>
   However, political experts said that the talk of separation --
combined with his prostate cancer -- cannot help but affect the
campaign. Democratic political consultant George Arzt said it
raised questions about Giuliani's determination to run and might
hurt him among socially conservative groups like Catholics and
Orthodox Jews.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Giuliani's marriage by reporters at a Syracuse
event, Hillary Clinton replied, ''I don't have anything to say.''
</P>
<P>
   After Giuliani's comments, Hanover summoned reporters to Gracie
Mansion and said the marriage had been strained for years and
alluded to a relationship the mayor had with an unnamed staff
member.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today's turn of events brings me great sadness,'' she said,
her eyes welling with tears. ''I had hoped that we could keep this
marriage together. For several years, it was difficult to
participate in Rudy's public life because of his relationship with
one staff member.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ''Beginning last May, I made a major effort to bring
us back together. Rudy and I re-established some of our personal
intimacy through the fall. At that point he chose another path.
Rudy and I will now discuss the possibility of a legal
separation.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports three years ago implied an affair between the mayor and
his then-director of communications, Cristyne Lategano-Nicholas,
35, who has since left City Hall and was recently married.
</P>
<P>
   There was never any confirmation of a romantic link between the
mayor and the aide and Hanover's statement did not elaborate on the
nature of the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Now the president of the city's Convention and Tourism Bureau,
Lategano-Nicholas said in a statement Wednesday, ''I have no desire
to speculate why Donna Hanover decided to issue the statement that
she did. Understandably, this is a difficult time. I wish both the
mayor and Donna Hanover a successful resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and Hanover have not appeared in public together in
years, although the mayor has been seen at both public and private
functions with Nathan during the past 10 months.
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's press conference, the mayor said he had
''tremendous respect'' for his wife, whom he called ''a wonderful
woman (and) wonderful mother.'' He went on to describe Nathan as
''a very, very kind person.''
</P>
<P>
   ''She's been a very good friend to me,'' said Giuliani. ''I rely
on her and she's helped me a great deal. And I'm going to need her
more now than maybe I did before.''
</P>
<P>
   Nathan is a registered nurse who lives with her 15-year-old
daughter on the Upper East Side.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani -- who usually keeps his emotions to himself and told
reporters ''I feel terrible'' and that he was ''very sad'' --
revealed a side that he has never shown before publicly and that
contrasted sharply to the upbeat manner in which he announced last
month that he has cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Looking wan and weighing each word, Giuliani spoke of the
emotional pain his troubled marriage has created and in part,
blamed the media.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm motivated by all the tremendous invasion of privacy that's
taken place,'' he said. ''My family's, Judith Nathan's family. This
is something that had developed over some period of time and it is
something between Donna and me, not anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   But while appealing for some privacy, Giuliani acknowledged that
as an elected official that his ''private life is open to
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   He said neither he nor his wife plan on moving out of Gracie
Mansion, the mayor's residence, for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   ''A separation agreement is not a divorce,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Mayor Imposes Cannes Curfew  </HEADLINE>
By CLAR NI CHONGHAILE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANNES, France (AP) -- Party animals in Cannes are growling after
the local mayor sought to put a lid on late-night beach parties.
</P>
<P>
   For many festival-goers, parties are a key part of the 12-day
see-and-be-seen extravaganza, but now Cannes Mayor Maurice Delauney
is cracking down, ordering that all beach parties must be shut down
by 12:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Delauney sent a terse memo to hotels and party organizers. ''The
city will not tolerate any violation,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Some all-night ravers may be moaning, but the curfew suits
laconic French filmmaker Luc Besson, head of this year's jury, just
fine.
</P>
<P>
   ''Honestly, after watching three or four films a day, that is
not going to be a problem for me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Want to know how many films are battling for the coveted Golden
Palm award? Well, don't ask the jury.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Wednesday, jury members seemed a little
vague about just how many films they would be watching.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think choosing 20 or 30 films ... is it 20 or 30?'' British
actor Jeremy Irons asked his fellow jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Besson came up with 22 -- only to be corrected by a
journalist, who gently reminded the 10-member jury that the magic
number was 23.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Chinese actor and director Jiang Wen has said his Cannes
offering, ''Devils on the Doorstep,'' is ''tense but accessible,
cruel but artistic, profound but humorous.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese censor is still deciding just how accessible it
should be.
</P>
<P>
   Due to be shown Saturday, the film about a still-painful period
in Chinese history -- the Japanese occupation -- is currently under
censorship in China.
</P>
<P>
   The black-and-white movie tells the tale of an isolated village
trying to deal with the arrival of a Japanese prisoner of war and
his interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   Wouter Barendrecht, co-chairman of Fortissimo Film Sales, which
is selling the film at Cannes, said: ''This is a normal procedure
in China and in a lot of other countries.'' He added that he
expected the film to be screened as planned.
</P>
<P>
   The director, who also stars in his film, is not the only Asian
filmmaker courting controversy -- Japanese veteran Nagisa Oshima,
back after a brain illness, is presenting ''Forbidden,'' the story
of homosexual love among samurai warriors.
</P>
<P>
   At 68, Oshima proves he can still raise eyebrows. Last March,
the Singapore Film Festival refused to show his 1976 classic erotic
movie ''In the Realm of the Senses'' after government censors
insisted on cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   As if film stars and top models weren't enough for the hordes of
stargazers hanging out on Cannes' tree-lined Croisette, this year's
festival also boasts a coterie of pop stars.
</P>
<P>
   Bjork headlines the list, appearing in a Lars Von Trier musical,
paired with French icon Catherine Deneuve.
</P>
<P>
   In ''Dancer in the Dark,'' the feisty Icelandic singer plays
Selma, a Czech immigrant and single mother working in a factory in
rural America. Her passion is classic Hollywood musicals.
</P>
<P>
   Also broadening their resumes are three members of the British
girl group All Saints, who star in ''Honest,'' directed by
Eurythmics guitarist Dave Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole and Nathalie Appleton and Melanie Blatt play tough
working-class sisters, thieving their way out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Female groupies, don't despair. Cannes also has something for
you to scream about. Blockbusting boys band 'N Sync will be in the
southern French city on May 16, unveiling a new film project to
begin shooting next year.
</P>
<P>
   The plot and title are under wraps for the moment.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Enters Hockey Quarterfinals  </HEADLINE>
By ERICA BULMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) -- Despite a lack of consistent
scoring from any player, the United States enters the quarterfinals
of the World Hockey Championship as the only undefeated team.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, seeking its fourth medal in 40 years at the
championships, plays gritty Slovakia in the first of Thursday's
quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   In other matchups, the Czech Republic, the defending world
champion and Olympic gold medalist, plays Latvia; Canada faces
Switzerland; and Finland meets Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   No U.S. player is among the top 25 in total scoring or assists,
and none ranks in the top 15 in goals. But the United States has
allowed a tourney-low seven goals. Damian Rhodes, who plays for the
NHL's Atlanta Thrashers, is third in the tournament with a
goals-against average of 2.00.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes' backup, Robert Esche of the minor-league AHL's
Springfield Falcons, has a 0.5 goals-against average, but hasn't
played enough minutes to qualify for the tournament rankings.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got a challenge in Slovakia, that's for sure,'' said
Vancouver Canucks forward Darby Hendrickson, making his fifth world
championships appearance for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got to do the same things we've done since the start of
the tournament. And that's play hard. And count on Esche and
Rhodes, because our goaltending has been big. But we've got to play
solid defensively and when we get our chances, get hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States hasn't won the gold at a world championships
since 1960, and can boast of just two bronze medals since.
</P>
<P>
   With few exceptions, the United States' best players skipped the
annual championship or couldn't make it because their teams were
still in the Stanley Cup playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Americans ended up with 13 NHL grinders, and
filled out the rest of the lineup with minor league, college and
European league players.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Lou Vairo, who worked behind the U.S. bench at the 1984
Olympics in Sarajevo, can count on 10 players who previously
competed at world championships.
</P>
<P>
   Slovakia has seven NHL players, and went undefeated in the
opening round, beating Austria and Italy before tying Finland.
</P>
<P>
   In a tougher second round, the Slovakians beat Norway 9-1 before
losing to the Czech Republic and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   With only four NHL players on the squad and Josef Augusta
replacing Hlinka behind the bench, the Czechs won all their
opening-round games. Their only loss came against Finland in the
second round, in a rematch of last year's final.
</P>
<P>
   The Czechs are a deep, experienced team with three Olympic
players: Pavel Patera, Martin Prochazka and Jiri Dopita.
</P>
<P>
   After a rough first round, Canada compiled solid victories over
Finland (5-1) and Italy (6-0) to reach the quarterfinals. It also
has a better team now, having added Martin Lapointe, Larry Murphy
and Kris Draper of the Detroit Red Wings, who were eliminated in
the second round of the NHL playoffs.

<HEADLINE> House Extends Web Tax Moratorium  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Computer users could surf without fear of
taxes that single out the Internet for five more years under
legislation passed by the House, part of a broader Republican
agenda aimed at appealing to the high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 352-75 Wednesday for the bill, part of a
Republican ''E-Contract 2000'' agenda intended to underscore their
support for the high-tech sector, a prime campaign contribution
battleground for both parties this election year. Other priority
issues include repealing the 102-year-old 3 percent telephone
excise tax, increasing visas for highly skilled foreign workers and
granting digital signatures the force of law.
</P>
<P>
   ''The high-tech industry is the future,'' said House Speaker
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. ''The last thing we want to do is impede our
future with high taxes and excessive government regulation.''
</P>
<P>
   The moratorium bill, sent to the House floor without a single
hearing, would extend for five years a current ban on
Internet-specific taxes that expires in October 2001. The bill is
designed to prevent states from taxing access to the Internet, such
as requiring computer users to pay taxes on their America Online
accounts. It also would bar new taxes aimed specifically at online
activity, such as the amount of time a user spends on the Internet
or how much material a user downloads.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the bill would repeal a grandfather clause enacted
in 1998 that allowed the states of Connecticut, Montana, New
Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas,
Washington and Wisconsin and 16 cities to keep taxes they had in
place at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Without the moratorium extension and repeal of the grandfather
clause, thousands of state, county and local taxing bureaucrats
could slow down Internet growth and ''drown the whole thing in a
sea of red tape,'' said Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't pile new taxes on the Internet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry groups applauded the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''E-commerce is barely in its infancy and a rush to impose
government levies could stifle its growth and development,'' said
Dorothy Coleman, tax policy vice president at the National
Association of Manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Opposing the five-year extension are state and local government
officials, including 39 governors worried about future revenue
losses for services ranging from roads to schools. Also against the
bill are many traditional retailers, including big chains like
Wal-Mart and Sears, that fear Internet competitors will gain an
unfair advantage due solely to tax laws.
</P>
<P>
   The moratorium doesn't directly address sales taxes. However,
under a Supreme Court ruling, states can't collect them from remote
sellers -- such as an Internet or catalog business -- unless the
company has a physical presence such as a warehouse or store in
that state. The moratorium extension, opponents say, would
effectively put those central issues on the back burner for far too
long.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. William Delahunt, D-Mass., pointed to a recent University
of Tennessee study estimating states could lose $20 billion in
sales tax revenue by 2003 if things remain as they are.
</P>
<P>
   ''These issues will not go away,'' said Rep. Jerrold Nadler,
D-N.Y. ''State and local governments will need clear rules on what
they can and cannot tax.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House issued a statement opposing the five-year
extension, saying it would ''in effect enact a hold on any further
consideration of Internet tax issues, creating uncertainty in a
vital and rapidly growing industry.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Robert Goodlatte, R-Va., said the moratorium ''has
absolutely nothing to do with the sales tax. We will have the
opportunity to have that debate.''
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 219-208 to defeat an amendment supported by the
White House that would have extended the tax moratorium for only
two years and kept the grandfather clause for some state and local
taxes. Another amendment that would have made the tax moratorium a
permanent ban also was defeated by a 336-90 vote.
</P>
<P>
   The five-year tax moratorium measure now heads to the Senate,
where it faces an uncertain future. Senate Commerce Committee
Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., put off consideration of his
permanent Internet tax ban bill after it encountered stiff
opposition last month.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been looking at a three-year extension,'' said Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. ''But it's not scheduled right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The tax moratorium extension bill is H.R. 3709.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals Pitcher's Father Arrested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT PIERCE, Fla. (AP) -- Soon to be imprisoned for participating
in a cocaine and marijuana trafficking operation, the father of St.
Louis Cardinals rookie pitcher Rick Ankiel was arrested for
allegedly throwing a loaded handgun from his car.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Ankiel, 43, was arrested Wednesday and charged with
possession of a firearm by a felon and culpable negligence. He was
being held without bail late Wednesday at St. Lucie County Jail.
</P>
<P>
   Ankiel was arrested after a motorist complained that a man in a
pickup truck had pointed a gun at him. As officer tried to pull the
truck over, a loaded 9 mm handgun was thrown from the passenger
side window, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Ankiel admitted throwing the gun, telling officers he was
scared, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Ankiel had been scheduled to report to federal prison on July 24
to begin serving an almost six-year sentence. He pleaded guilty
last year to two counts of conspiracy to possess with intent to
distribute cocaine and marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   He had been free on $100,000 bond pending his surrender.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Ankiel, a 20-year-old Port St. Lucie High School graduate,
is 3-2 for the Cardinals and has hit two homers.

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves Saline Breast Implants  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even though saline-filled breast implants
break open at ''alarmingly high'' rates, two U.S. manufacturers
will be allowed to continue selling the devices as long as women
are informed that many of them will need additional surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's ruling marked the Food and Drug Administration's
first formal approval of the long-sold implants, which have been on
the market for years without any official safety decree because of
a provision that allowed products already on the market when the
FDA first began regulating medical devices in 1976 to keep selling.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the FDA ordered manufacturers to prove the devices are
safe. The FDA on Wednesday said the implants sold by Mentor Corp.
and McGhan Medical, both of Santa Barbara, Calif., had complied and
could remain on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Implants made by three smaller competitors, all U.S. offices of
foreign companies, must quit selling in the United States by
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Women's health advocates condemned the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''The standard of safety is at a new low at FDA,'' said Diana
Zuckerman of the National Center for Policy Research for Women and
Families. ''Here you have the benefit which is cosmetic and the
risks which are serious health problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The FDA's independent scientific advisers in March had
recommended approval of the implants, despite declaring that they
break open and leak at ''alarmingly high'' rates. The panel heard
testimony from dozens of women claiming the implants caused pain
and disfigurement, while some cancer survivors said they were
important for their emotional recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA's ruling was not a ringing endorsement. But the agency
noted that many women desperately want these implants -- 130,000 got
them last year despite the safety uncertainty -- and in company
studies, many women said they were happy despite all the implants'
complications.
</P>
<P>
   ''Women should understand that breast implants do not last a
lifetime,'' warned FDA medical devices chief Dr. David Feigal.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the things they should consider ... is they've got
about a 1 in 6 chance of facing another surgical operation'' within
three years of implantation, he added. Too many Americans have
gotten breast implants without understanding that, he said.
</P>
<P>
   To make sure women get that message, the FDA wrote a booklet
describing the risks that plastic surgeons were ordered to give
potential patients before the day of surgery, so women can decide
if implants are worth trying.
</P>
<P>
   Women should demand the booklet if their doctor forgets to offer
it, Feigal said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the warnings: Over 20 percent of women who get
saline-filled breast implants need additional surgeries within
three years, most because patients suffered painful scar tissue or
an infection or the implant broke and leaked.
</P>
<P>
   The risk is worse for women who get the implants after breast
cancer surgery than for women who choose cosmetic breast
enlargement, the FDA warned. Some 40 percent of cancer survivors
need additional surgeries within three years.
</P>
<P>
   And the longer women have implants, the more likely they are to
suffer a side effect, FDA scientists say. Up to 73 percent of
patients in one study suffered at least one side effect.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to pain, leakage and reoperations, other side
effects include loss of nipple sensation, asymmetry, and wrinkling
or puckering skin at the implant site.
</P>
<P>
   Saline-filled implants are the only option for most women
wanting implants. In 1992, the FDA banned use of silicone
gel-filled breast implants except for a few cancer survivors in
strictly controlled clinical trials, a ban that continues today. No
other implants are sold here.
</P>
<P>
   Another option for cancer patients is for doctors to rebuild
their breasts using fat and tissue from other parts of their body.
</P>
<P>
   The breast implants controversy arose in the early 1990s, when
thousands of women claimed implants gave them serious diseases,
from arthritis to cancer. But after repeated scientific studies,
the Institute of Medicine last year declared that implants, whether
silicone gel- or saline-filled, do not cause major diseases. So the
FDA's concerns about saline implants center on breast-specific
complications.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute of Medicine is part of the National Academy of
Sciences, a private organization chartered by Congress to advise
the government on scientific matters.

<HEADLINE> Iowa Adjusts To Immigrant Population  </HEADLINE>
By BECKY BOHRER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SIOUX CITY, Iowa (AP) -- Dann Speichinger wants to know what
planet is third from the sun and a boy with a heavy Spanish accent
answers correctly: ''Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   The multi-grade classroom fills with spontaneous chatter in
Spanish, French, even an African dialect. Speichinger, who teaches
English as a second language in the Sioux City Community School
District, is at a loss. He speaks only English.
</P>
<P>
   Speichinger and other native Iowans have watched the state's
racial fabric change over the past few years as they welcome -- and
confront -- a booming Hispanic population.
</P>
<P>
   There are 31 million Hispanics in the United States and the
minority group is the nation's fastest-growing. By the year 2050,
their numbers are expected to triple and they may account for one
of every four Americans, up from 12 percent now.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, there were 33,000 Hispanics in Iowa, compared
with about 48,000 blacks, Census Bureau figures show. But Iowa
State University researchers say Hispanics are expected to
outnumber blacks as the state's largest minority population when
2000 figures are released.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau counted approximately 73,000 Hispanics in Iowa in
1998. Many of the new arrivals come from Mexico, drawn to
meatpacking jobs that offer $9-an-hour entry-level positions and
don't require fluent English.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics already have changed the face of Sioux City, a
Missouri River community of 83,000 in the state's northwestern
corner. In many ways, Sioux City is a microcosm of the change afoot
in Iowa: New students arrive almost daily for ESL classes, there
are new Mexican clothing shops and there's even a Spanish-language
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Change is catching some by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if this is a good thing or not yet,'' Bill Kai
said recently, adjusting his Pennzoil racing cap as he drank coffee
at the Eagles club with a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess it's our fault, really. We don't want them jobs and
they've gotta find someone to fill them.''
</P>
<P>
   Immigration has long been a touchy subject in Iowa. Some state
lawmakers have pushed to make English the state's official
language, their efforts failing again this year.
</P>
<P>
   During the political campaigns that preceded the Iowa caucuses
in January, there were anti-immigrant advertisements run on
television and in newspapers, sponsored by groups based on the East
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   One ad, by the Washington, D.C.-based Federation for American
Immigration Reform, claimed a flood of immigrants had reduced the
quality of life in Storm Lake, a western Iowa town of about 8,800
people, to a ''memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Many state leaders, including Gov. Tom Vilsack, criticized the
ads and pledged their support of diversity, even as editorial pages
printed letters full of anti-immigrant sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's sad sometimes that I have to explain why I'm here or why
it is my right to be here,'' said Alejandra Magana, who recently
passed her citizenship exam. ''Immigrants are here to work. We're
not leeches.''
</P>
<P>
   The unrest is compounded by concern that many immigrants are
here illegally. Iowa, like other Midwest states, has consistently
low unemployment, meaning nearly everyone who wants a job has one.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial Operation Vanguard, which included Nebraska
and western Iowa, was put on hold last year after the Social
Security Administration balked at plans to run the names of
meatpacking workers through its records. The Immigration and
Naturalization Service effort was aimed at finding illegal
immigrants working in packing plants.
</P>
<P>
   Early last year, about 300 protesters rallied against Operation
Vanguard outside the Marshall County Courthouse, some carrying
signs that read: ''Don't Panic, We're Just Hispanic.''
</P>
<P>
   In early 1997, two INS agents were put in Sioux City, with Rep.
Tom Latham, R-Iowa, saying the move was ''something that many
northwest Iowans felt was needed to address our growing drug and
illegal immigration problems.'' More agents were added last year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, more than 3,500 illegal immigrants are expected to be
arrested this year in Iowa and Nebraska alone, according to Michael
Went, a top INS official in the Omaha, Neb. In 1994, just 423
people were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Many Hispanics say they have confronted anti-immigrant feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Tears well in Tomasa Salas' eyes as she remembers an unhappy
encounter years ago. Her car door dinged a pickup in a grocery
store parking lot. She heard the man inside the pickup say, ''Why
don't you go back to where you came from?''
</P>
<P>
   ''I told him, 'I'm clean. I took a shower today.' I don't know
why, but that's the first thing that came to mind,'' said Salas,
who has lived in Sioux City for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do have racism in this community and that is a fact,'' said
Belia Stauder, a translator who works with immigrants. ''There are
people who do not want immigrants here. If they could get rid of
them, they would.''
</P>
<P>
   Magana, 26, lives in a trailer park in South Sioux City with her
brother Juan, a laborer. She said she is tired of explaining to
Iowa residents why she left Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all come from someplace. We're proud of that. We're proud
of our culture,'' she said. ''I wish people would understand
that.''

<HEADLINE> Appeals Court To Hear Elian Case  </HEADLINE>
By RUSS BYNUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- For Elian Gonzalez's Miami relatives, a hearing
before three federal judges could be their last chance to win an
asylum hearing for the little boy whose father wants to take him
back to Cuban.
</P>
<P>
   The judicial panel from the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
scheduled a hearing today to determine if the 6-year-old is too
young to seek asylum over the objections of his father.
</P>
<P>
   So far, immigration officials and a federal judge in Miami have
rejected the asylum application signed by Elian and filed by his
great uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for both the U.S. government and Juan Miguel Gonzalez,
the boy's father, say Elian is not mature enough to make such
choices. They say the father is the one to decide for his son.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a high probability this is the last stand'' for the
Miami relatives, said Charles Keely, a professor of international
migration at Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   If the judges rule against the relatives, there is no assurance
the full 11th Circuit Court or the Supreme Court will hear their
appeals.
</P>
<P>
   The three 11th Circuit judges ordered that Elian remain in the
country until they ruled on his appeal. But there is no guarantee
he would be barred from leaving before further appeals could be
heard.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was found clinging to an inner tube off the coast of
Florida on Nov. 25. His mother and 10 others died trying to flee
Cuba when their boat capsized, while Elian and two others survived.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th Circuit judges have noted that immigration law allows
''any alien,'' with no age limit, to seek asylum in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers have cited a 1985 case in which a 12-year-old
Soviet boy was granted asylum against his parents' wishes. The
federal appeals court in that case ruled that 12 was ''presumably
near the lower end of an age range'' for which children could defy
their parents' wishes.
</P>
<P>
   The judges could decide the Immigration and Naturalization
Service was right in denying Elian's asylum application, or it
could order the INS to give the boy an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The judges also could rule somewhere in the middle, such as
telling the INS to interview Elian and then decide if his
application should be heard.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father also has asked the court to let him replace
Lazaro Gonzalez as the adult representing the boy in the lawsuit.
If the judges agree, Juan Miguel Gonzalez could drop the case.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the government and the 11th Circuit received the
latest reports from a child psychiatrist and a social worker chosen
to monitor Elian and report every other week on his condition.
</P>
<P>
   Judge J.L. Edmondson sealed the reports, but sources familiar
with the reports, requesting anonymity, said child psychiatrist
Paulina Kernberg concluded that Elian was healthy and was
integrating with his family at a Maryland retreat and playing well
with others.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th Circuit Court panel -- Judges Joel A. Dubina, Charles R.
Wilson and Edmondson -- has no deadline to issue a ruling. Some
legal experts predict they will move quickly, perhaps ruling in two
to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Either side would have 45 days to ask all 12 judges of the 11th
Circuit Court to hear the case. If the court refused, the losing
side would have 90 days to appeal to the Supreme Court.

<HEADLINE> LA Judge Delays Thai Toddler Return  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT JABLON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- What happens when children from abroad find
themselves all alone in America?
</P>
<P>
   In the case of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, it was political
uproar, street confrontations, vast media exposure and an armed
federal raid to return him to his Cuban father.
</P>
<P>
   For 2-year-old Phanupong Khaisri of Thailand, it was a brief
confrontation between Thai civic leaders in Los Angeles and federal
immigration officials that led to a court order temporarily barring
his deportation.
</P>
<P>
   While both cases captured public attention, neither is
indicative of what happens to the vast majority of children who
enter the United States illegally and fall under the jurisdiction
of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of other minors who arrive on U.S. shores are quietly
held in detention centers or shipped back home.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there is a very focused attention on certain celebrity
cases when it's in the interest of U.S. foreign policy or when it's
in the interest of specific sectors,'' said Sasha Khokha,
spokeswoman for the National Network for Immigration and Refugee
Rights in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't hear this kind of outcry about the approximately
8,000 Mexican children under the age of 17 that the United States
government expelled in 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 4,607 children under 18 were in INS custody. On
average, 475 are in custody at any time, the agency said, and they
usually are deported within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Delays can be made for medical reasons. Elian, for example, was
treated for severe dehydration, while Phanupong had surgery for an
ear infection.
</P>
<P>
   In Elian's case, his Miami relatives are seeking his political
asylum over the U.S. government's order to return him to his
father, who wants the boy to return with him to Cuba. A federal
appeals court is weighing the case.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. law treats Cubans differently than other immigrants. It
allows any Cuban who reaches American soil to apply for permanent
residency after being in the United States for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Elian fell under this law because he was brought to a hospital
in the United States after being rescued at sea Nov. 25. If he had
come from almost any other country, he would have been deported
right away.
</P>
<P>
   While Phanupong's case has gained less attention, he has
benefited from the support of Thai community leaders in Southern
California. He has no relatives in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   When the boy arrived in Los Angeles on April 11, authorities
said he was being used as a prop by a man trying to smuggle a
Chinese woman into the country. The intent was to make the three
look like a family.
</P>
<P>
   Phanupong's local caretakers, chosen by the Thai consulate, are
seeking political asylum for him, but only until they are convinced
the toddler will go home to a safe environment and won't wind up in
the hands of smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   ''This isn't a custody battle at all,'' said Hae Jung Cho,
project director for the Coalition to Abolish Slavery and
Trafficking. ''This isn't a political issue. It's just a case of a
little boy who was a victim of a human rights abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   The Thai Community Development Center enlisted several lawmakers
to pressure the INS to delay the boy's deportation and sued to
block his return home. The group won a two-week delay Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Thai boy's paternal grandparents have agreed to adopt him,
and the toddler could be back in Thailand for his third birthday
next month.
</P>
<P>
   Phanupong's caretakers and their lawyer allege the INS tried to
rush his repatriation and delay Elian's because Thailand has
friendly relations with the United States and Cuba doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   The INS says it followed standard procedures in both cases.
</P>
<P>
   When unaccompanied minors arrive in the country, the agency
works with their native government to have them placed with local
relatives or sent back to parents ''within 72 hours, if at all
possible,'' said Karen Kraushaar, an INS spokeswoman in Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our view is that a child is always better off with caring
relatives,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrant rights activists say they hope the high-profile cases
of Elian and Phanupong will raise awareness of the often-tragic
circumstances of immigrant children.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, Khokha said, Americans will be persuaded to help ''the
thousands of other immigrant children that may not have their
stories told and ... their voices heard.''

<HEADLINE> Agassi Wins Match at Italian Open  </HEADLINE>
By ELLEN KNICKMEYER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- If Andre Agassi were to write a ''Career-Counseling
Guide to Long-Term Success,'' it likely would have some tips you
wouldn't find anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Such as: slack off once in a while. Let yourself get distracted.
Don't give it your all -- at least, not always.
</P>
<P>
   ''In 1997, I played 12 times. It wasn't much. You can argue I
didn't even play those 12,'' Agassi said after an easy second-round
win at the Italian Open. He was trying to explain why his career is
surging again at age 30 while the months-younger Jim Courier's has
just ended.
</P>
<P>
   Courier announced his retirement Tuesday, after a stalled three
years that included just one of his 23 career titles.
</P>
<P>
   ''My career has been different than Jim's, you know,'' the
top-seeded Agassi said Wednesday, advancing in a tournament where
he once routinely lost in the earliest rounds, and seemed happy
enough to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jim has worked hard every single day, every single year of his
whole career, you know,'' he said. ''I've tried to live a large
part of my life during my career.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Jim said it best when ... he talked about, now it's
time for his life, because it's always been tennis first. And I can
understand that,'' Agassi said. ''But for me, it hasn't always been
tennis first. So I think I'm a little fresher.''
</P>
<P>
   Fresher, he clearly is. And confident, after a clean start in
his first appearance since being sidelined by a thigh injury in
April, and in his first European event since his French Open
triumph last year.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi won with ease Wednesday against qualifer Gaston Gaudio of
Argentina to move to today's match against No. 15 Dominik Hrbaty of
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Today's other matches pitted No. 3 Magnus Norman of Sweden
against Andrei Medvedev of Ukraine; No. 4 Gustavo Kuerten of
Brazil, the defending champion, against No. 14 Younes El Aynaoui of
Morocco; and No. 7 Thomas Enqvist of Sweden against an
up-and-coming 19-year-old Australian, No. 9 Lleyton Hewitt.
</P>
<P>
   Yevgeny Kafelnikov, the No. 2 seed, presumably is heading home,
getting in some last-minute Rome sightseeing or otherwise making
plans after Wednesday's fourth straight early exit from a
tournament this season. The Russian fell to Mariano Puerta of
Spain, 6-4, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 Australian Open champion, Kafelnikov was docked
appearance fee money earlier this season for alleged apathy on the
court.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Agassi, now in his seventh appearance at Rome,
conveys himself as earnest, gracious toward the event's young
competitors, and intent on his game.
</P>
<P>
   All this at a tournament -- and on a surface, clay -- where he
once was more usually lackluster.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Agassi came to Rome days early with Steffi Graf,
played at a charity event, and managed to be fairly charming even
in translation in a drop-by on an Italian TV variety show.
</P>
<P>
   It was in Rome last year, when he advanced to the third round,
that Agassi made the turnaround into what became an extraordinary
12 months -- regaining the top spot, and becoming only the fifth man
to win all four Grand Slam titles.
</P>
<P>
   Staying fresh, Agassi made clear after his second-round victory,
also is a matter of one tip that's a career-counseling standard:
motivation.
</P>
<P>
   He's got that too.
</P>
<P>
   ''For me, it's truly a question of understanding if I still have
my best tennis ahead of me,'' he said. ''You know, I think there
are areas that I feel like I can still get better; I feel like I
have the opportunity to still get better. And I think that that
helps with the desire.''

<HEADLINE> Music Distributors Settle Charges  </HEADLINE>
By REBECCA SINDERBRAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Music lovers who complain about the high
prices of CDs may be getting a break, thanks to an agreement five
major music distributors reached with the government to settle
allegations that the companies have been overcharging customers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement announced Wednesday, the five companies will
discontinue ''minimum advertised price'' programs that required
retailers to sell music compact discs at or above a set level in
return for getting substantial funding to underwrite their
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The programs cost consumers $480 million since 1997, the Federal
Trade Commission estimated.
</P>
<P>
   ''These settlements ... should help restore much needed
competition to the retail music market,'' FTC Chairman Robert
Pitofsky said. ''Today's news should be sweet music to the ears of
all CD purchasers.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the consent agreement, Universal Music and Video
Distribution, Sony Corp. of America, Time-Warner Inc., EMI Music
Distribution and Bertelsmann Music Group will be barred from using
minimum price programs for the next seven years.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the government agreed not to seek damages for past
pricing practices of the companies, and the companies did not admit
any wrongdoing, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the five companies did not immediately return calls
seeking comment. The Recording Industry Association of America
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC said the five companies distribute 85 percent of the
music CDs sold in the United States. The industry reported a record
$15 billion in sales last year.
</P>
<P>
   The government contended the distributors and retailers wanted
to keep CD prices high to avoid a repeat of the price wars of the
early 1990s when consumers paid as little as $9.99 for some popular
CDs.
</P>
<P>
   The companies adopted the minimum advertised price policies in
1995-96. By 1997, CD music ''price wars'' had ended, and the price
of compact discs first stabilized, then steadily increased.
</P>
<P>
   The average CD now costs $14 to $17. That's as much as 30
percent to 50 percent more than a cassette tape with identical
content.
</P>
<P>
   The recording industry attributes the price difference to the
CD's higher sound quality and ease of use.

<HEADLINE> Apnea May Link to Blood Pressure  </HEADLINE>
By JANET McCONNAUGHEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Apnea, the disorder that interrupts people's breathing while
they sleep, may be a cause of high blood pressure rather than
something that accompanies it, researchers suggest in a study
published today.
</P>
<P>
   The team from the University of Wisconsin looked at more than
700 people for four to eight years. Some had sleep apnea; others
did not. The worse their apnea was at the start of the study, the
more likely they were to develop high blood pressure later on.
</P>
<P>
   Since the apnea came first, this is the strongest evidence yet
that apnea may be a cause or something that speeds the progress of
high blood pressure, said Paul E. Peppard of the preventive
medicine department.
</P>
<P>
   ''Doctors need to take sleep apnea seriously,'' said Peppard,
whose study was reported in today's New England Journal of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   A Johns Hopkins University study published last month in the
Journal of the American Medical Association suggested a similar
connection.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors do not know just how apnea might aggravate or cause high
blood pressure. But Peppard said disturbed, fragmented sleep and
reduced oxygen in the blood might put the sympathetic nervous
system, which responds to stress and readies the body for action,
on ''high alert'' all day.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rose Marie Robertson, president-elect of the American Heart
Association, said the study does not indicate cause and effect, but
the connection is intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the important thing about this article is that it will
make doctors who see patients with sleep apnea be certain that
they're measuring their blood pressure,'' she said. ''Half of the
50 million people in this country who have high blood pressure do
not know they have it.
</P>
<P>
   About 12 million Americans have sleep apnea -- their breathing
stops several or dozens of times an hour, interrupting their sleep
without their knowledge -- according to the American Sleep Apnea
Association.
</P>
<P>
   People with sleep apnea often wake up unrested or feel sleepy
during the day. Most people who have sleep apnea snore loudly.
</P>
<P>
   ''For years it's been a nuisance or a comical noise. Our mission
is to make it clear that it's more than a nuisance and not so
comical,'' Peppard said.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that even mild apnea, with fewer than five sleep
interruptions per hour, increased the likelihood of developing high
blood pressure about 40 percent. Moderate apnea, with fewer than 15
interruptions an hour, doubled the chances, and severe apnea nearly
tripled them.
</P>
<P>
   And that was after statistical techniques were used to weed out
other factors related to high blood pressure, such as age, weight
or smoking.

<HEADLINE> Some Become Human Lie-Detectors  </HEADLINE>
By RICK CALLAHAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   For decades, neurologists have talked of the uncanny ability of
some brain-injured patients to sense when someone was lying, even
though they perceived the liar's words as gibberish.
</P>
<P>
   Neurologist Oliver Sacks even wrote in his bestseller, ''The Man
Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat,'' that it was all but impossible to
lie to patients who have lost their speech-recognition abilities.
</P>
<P>
   Now, scientists have experimental proof to back up the claims,
with a study showing that people who suffer from aphasia apparently
sniff out liars by reading subtle facial expressions.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're picking up nuances of facial expression, a momentary
expression that flashes by quickly in the presence of a masking
smile, a fake smile. They're picking up on these leaks of
emotions,'' said Nancy Etcoff, a psychologist at Massachusetts
General Hospital who led the study published in today's issue of
the journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   The study involved patients who suffered a stroke or other
trauma to the left side of their brain, the site of
speech-recognition functions.
</P>
<P>
   The patients in the study could not understand full sentences
delivered at conversational speed but could comprehend single words
and simplified speech like that used to communicate with a child.
All could express themselves to various degrees and could read and
write.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers showed 10 such patients videos in which women
described watching pleasant scenes such as a tropical sunset.
</P>
<P>
   Each woman made two videos. In one version, she was actually
viewing a relaxing scene on a TV screen and commenting on its
beauty. But in the other version, she had to lie about what she was
seeing because she was actually watching ghastly images of burn
victims and amputees.
</P>
<P>
   The aphasic patients used agreed-upon signals such as raising a
hand to indicate when they thought the woman was lying.
</P>
<P>
   Non-aphasics had only about a 50-50 chance of spotting when the
woman was lying. But the aphasics spotted the liar 73 percent of
the time, showing the kind of skill that could make for expert
poker players or police interrogators.
</P>
<P>
   ''People have told me, 'These patients should be on juries or in
customs lines at the airport.' There's been a lot of jesting,''
Etcoff said. ''The fact is that some people are really good at this
who are not aphasics, but for the rest of us, it's just chance.
We're just not very good at it.''
</P>
<P>
   All but one of the patients were shown the videos more than a
year after they suffered their injuries. The patient tested within
a year of his injury performed no better than the normal group.
</P>
<P>
   That suggests the damaged brain slowly ''rewires'' itself to
deal with speech, said Dr. Elliott Ross, a professor of neurology
at the University of Oklahoma in Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   Ross said it is the first study in a major scientific
publication to demonstrate clearly that aphasics can sense deceit
in speakers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It shows very nicely that when you have damage to the left
side of the brain you increase your ability to capture deceitful
behaviors. It's really breaking new ground,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier research has suggested that across most cultures people
learn at an early age to control their facial expressions so as to
conceal their unhappiness or unease, particularly in awkward social
situations.
</P>
<P>
   Ross said other studies have indicated that when a person lies,
his or her true emotional state is betrayed by upper facial
expressions, while the area around the mouth projects the intended,
fake emotional state.
</P>
<P>
   Ross' own research suggests that the brain's right hemisphere --
the one undamaged in aphasia patients -- is better than the left
half at detecting emotions conveyed by the evocative upper facial
area.
</P>
<P>
   Besides speech-recognition deficiencies, many aphasia patients
also suffer from the inability to form words and to read and write.
</P>
<P>
   But they also have an edge in some respects, Sacks said
Wednesday. He recounted the story of a cousin who became fond of
travel after suffering a stroke that left her with aphasia. The
condition gave her an edge over other travelers who didn't speak
the native tongue.
</P>
<P>
   ''In Mexico, when no one in the family could understand Spanish
at all, she became sort of the interpreter,'' Sacks said. ''This
stroke was 20 years ago and she still sees through me. She sees
through everybody.''

<HEADLINE> El Salvador Army Warehouse Explodes  </HEADLINE>
By DIEGO MENDEZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) -- An underground arms warehouse
caught fire and exploded in San Salvador, injuring dozens and
flinging unexploded grenades into nearby residential neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of Wednesday's fire was unknown, said Salvadoran
Defense Minister Gen. Juan Martinez Varela.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue workers extinguished the fire and evacuated 500 people
from nearby neighborhoods where at least 1,000 unexploded grenades
landed during the explosion, said Defense Ministry spokesman Col.
Roberto Alas.
</P>
<P>
   At least 50 military explosives specialists were sent to the
area to recover the grenades. Fire from the explosion spread to
several homes, but the blaze was quickly extinguished. The
explosion also destroyed vehicles and shattered windows.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Miguel, a gas station employee working near the
warehouse, said he heard the explosion, and then ''it started
raining rocks, splinters, and grenades, which fortunately didn't
explode.''
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said they saw several wounded soldiers from the
warehouse being transported from the scene. Officials have not
given an exact number of injuries, saying only that dozens were
injured.

<HEADLINE> Fiber Can Cut Diabetics' Blood Sugar  </HEADLINE>
By JANET McCONNAUGHEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many diabetics can significantly lower their blood sugar and
maybe even reduce their need for medication by eating lots of
fruits, vegetables and high-fiber grain, researchers reported
today.
</P>
<P>
   The experimental diet -- tested on 13 diabetics -- contained 50
grams of fiber a day, or about twice the amount recommended by the
American Diabetes Association. That is equivalent to seven or eight
servings of fruit and vegetables and three of whole wheat or other
high-fiber grain.
</P>
<P>
   The study published in today's New England Journal of Medicine
was led by Dr. Abhimanyu Garg of UT Southwestern Medical Center in
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Diabetes occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough
insulin, the hormone needed for the body to process sugar for
energy. The most common form of diabetes, striking up to 2,000 of
every 100,000 people, usually develops gradually in adults. These
people produce insulin, but not enough. Their disease usually can
be controlled with diet, weight loss and once-a-day pills.
</P>
<P>
   All of the people studied had this form of diabetes; 10 of them
were taking pills.
</P>
<P>
   The diabetics spent six weeks on the ADA-recommended diet and
six weeks on the experimental diet. The experimental diet reduced
blood sugar levels about 10 percent. The ADA diet is aimed at
keeping blood sugar under control but does not reduce levels.
</P>
<P>
   The drop in blood sugar was about the same as what a second pill
might have brought, Dr. Marc Rendell of the Creighton Diabetes
Center in Omaha, Neb., said in an editorial.
</P>
<P>
   None of the patents in the study were able to reduce their
medication, but Garg said that wasn't the point of the experiment.
He would not speculate on whether the diet could let patients
reduce their medication.
</P>
<P>
   The diet also improved the diabetics' cholesterol levels, which
was encouraging. Heart disease is a major cause of death among
diabetics.
</P>
<P>
   An ADA task force is working on new dietary recommendations and
hopes to have them out before January.
</P>
<P>
   ''My hope would be that the task force would take a close look
at this study,'' said Anne Daly, ADA vice president of health care
education.
</P>
<P>
   The average American eats about 16 or 17 grams of fiber a day.
</P>
<P>
   Daly said the study will help more doctors realize the
importance of diet in controlling diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Diabetics whose disease develops rapidly in children and
teen-agers often produce so little insulin that they must give
themselves shots of it. The form affects about one-tenth as many
people as the other form.

<HEADLINE> Roberts Seeks Repeat at Nelson  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG FERGUSON, AP Golf Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Loren Roberts joined the ranks of PGA Tour
players spending as much time in the weight room as the driving
range, and what a difference it made.
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't even hit the ball,'' he said Wednesday at the Byron
Nelson Classic, where the 44-year-old Roberts will try to defend
his title. ''So, I quit doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Smart move.
</P>
<P>
   Once he got back to his old body, he got back to his old swing --
especially that ultrasmooth putting stroke that earned him the
title, ''Boss of the Moss.''
</P>
<P>
   He quietly finished fourth behind Tiger Woods in the Bay Hill,
and he was the only short-knocker on the leaderboard at Augusta
National, where he had a chance to win the Masters, but finished in
a tie for third with David Duval.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago in Houston, Roberts was at in again, finishing one
stroke out of a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson in all of this? Listen to your doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ''The guy who works with me told me that structurally, I wasn't
someone who could do that sort of thing and get much benefit out of
it because I'm so inflexible,'' he said. ''And I guess he proved
that right.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that Roberts has figured that out, he can go back to proving
people wrong that the PGA Tour is only for guys who hit it long and
high.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts does neither, ranked 183rd on tour in driving distance
with an average tee shot of 248 yards, or about the distance Woods
gets with his 2-iron.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Augusta National. Masters champion Vijay Singh,
runner-up Ernie Els, Duval, and Woods are all power players.
Spotted among them was Roberts, who relies primarily on his
accuracy -- he is ranked No. 1 -- and his putting.
</P>
<P>
   That combination helped him win the Nelson Classic a year ago in
a playoff over Steve Pate, and he'll have to rely on that again
this week if he wants to join some exclusive company. The only
players to successfully defend their Nelson title were Sam Snead,
Jack Nicklaus and Tom Watson.
</P>
<P>
   None of those Hall of Famers are at the TPC at Las Colinas this
week, but Roberts nevertheless will have his hands full with one of
the strongest fields ever in the Nelson Classic.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the list is Woods, back from his post-Masters
vacation that was just that. He fished with Mark O'Meara in Utah,
got out of a commercial shoot for Nike when the Screen Actors Guild
went on strike and didn't get back to work until last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first three weeks, I touched a club one time because I had
to for a catalog shoot,'' Woods said Wednesday. ''Other than that,
I didn't touch a club.''
</P>
<P>
   Before anyone wonders about the rust, consider the record.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with the PGA Championship in August, Woods has returned
from every break of at least two weeks by winning his first
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   He will try to make it six in a row in the Nelson, played on the
remodeled TPC at Las Colinas and the always easy Cottonwood Valley
Golf Course.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think you just get rejuvenated,'' Woods said. ''You come
back with a clear mind. When you're out here playing every week,
it's hard to come out after each and every round and go out there
and hit balls for four or five hours. You just can't do it, unless
you're Vijay. For normal people, we'd wear ourselves out.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be Vijay Singh, the Masters champion who is among
nine tour winners in a strong field at the Nelson, where the $4
million purse matches Pebble Beach as the largest for a regular PGA
Tour event.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the field are Phil Mickelson and Hal Sutton, both with
two 2000 wins, including a victorious showdown over Woods. And then
there's Duval, also coming off a four-week break after the Masters
and still searching for his first win in over a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would love to win, and I have every intention of doing
that,'' Duval said. ''I don't think it's something you forget how
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The tournament pumped $3 million into renovations of the TPC at
Las Colinas. The most significant change was a new tee box on No.
10, making players carry a canal to the fairway.
</P>
<P>
   They also put in the Peggy Nelson tree, named for Lord Byron's
wife. The Live Oak is 32 feet high and 25 feet wide, located about
130 yards from the green down the right side to make players think
twice about trying to drive the 385-yard hole.
</P>
<P>
   For Roberts, that was never an issue.

<HEADLINE> Avs Coach Wants To Protect Forwards  </HEADLINE>
By AARON J. LOPEZ, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- A year's time has done little to erase the memory
of Colorado Avalanche forwards Milan Hejduk and Peter Forsberg
crumpled on the ice courtesy of Dallas Stars defenseman Richard
Matvichuk.
</P>
<P>
   While clean, the check on Hejduk broke the Czech's collarbone
and ended his impressive rookie season. The hit on Forsberg
resulted in a shoulder injury that required offseason surgery, and
remains a point of contention for Avalanche coach Bob Hartley.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was definitely an attempt to injure,'' Hartley said
Wednesday as Colorado prepared to open the Western Conference
finals Saturday at Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Both hits came during Game 4 of last year's conference finals.
The Avalanche won in overtime, but Dallas took the best-of-seven
series 4-3. Hartley expects the NHL's two-referee system to deter
Matvichuk from taking any cheap shots when the rivalry resumes.
</P>
<P>
   ''For once, I truly believe that Matvichuk won't be able to get
away with what he got away with last year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The comments were unprovoked by the media, and when asked if he
was lobbying, Hartley took another shot at Matvichuk.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not lobbying. I just feel sorry that he didn't get the
Conn Smythe (Trophy)'' given to the Stanley Cup MVP, he said. ''I
felt that with all the destruction that he did, I think he should
have maybe got that trophy.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether he was posturing, lobbying or simply venting, Hartley
can take comfort in knowing that Hejduk, Forsberg and fellow
forward Joe Sakic are healthy and playing well.
</P>
<P>
   Hejduk, who led the Avalanche with 36 goals, and Sakic each have
two goals and four assists, while Forsberg has five goals and five
assists.
</P>
<P>
   ''We realize the people we have to zero in on,'' Dallas forward
Joe Nieuwendyk said. ''It's no secret that Forsberg is a key player
and Sakic is a key player. Matvichuk and (Derian) Hatcher are going
to see a lot of those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk agreed with Hartley that two referees should reduce
the number of vengeful hits that are common in the playoffs. ''I
think it takes away cheap penalties behind the plays.''
</P>
<P>
   While Hatcher and Matvichuk cover the blue line for Dallas, the
Avalanche are optimistic that Ray Bourque will be reunited with
Adam Foote on Colorado's first line of defense.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque, seeking his first Stanley Cup in 21 seasons, missed the
last two games of the conference semifinals after injuring his left
knee. He has been able to skate in the past week but has not taken
part in contact drills with the team.
</P>
<P>
   ''The medical staff will let us know later on during the week if
he's going to be available, but he feels great,'' Hartley said.
''He's skating very well. There's no pain.''

<HEADLINE> No Gunfire Caught on Waco Tapes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas (AP) -- The final report on a simulation of Branch
Davidian siege indicates that flashes seen on a videotape were
sunlight reflecting off debris, not government gunfire as claimed
in a wrongful death lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Vector Data Systems, the British firm that conducted the March
19 simulation at Fort Hood, submitted its conclusions this week to
U.S. District Judge Walter Smith Jr., who is presiding over the
Branch Davidian lawsuit. A preliminary report sent to Smith last
month gave similar conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   By comparing the simulation to videotapes from the last day of
the siege, Vector found that the 1993 flashes were caused by
reflections off metal and glass, including a helicopter canopy and
falling and wind-blown debris.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were unable to identify any gunfire, either from government
forces or from Davidians, from either the (infrared tapes) or other
collateral imagery available to us,'' the report stated.
</P>
<P>
   The report also states that no one was seen prior to the
breakout of two fires that consumed the compound on April 19, 1993.
At least 80 people died during the inferno.
</P>
<P>
   ''This analysis vindicates those FBI people long accused of
shooting into the compound,'' said Deputy FBI Director Thomas
Pickard. ''The FBI's long-standing and steadfast position that no
shots were fired has now been strongly and independently
corroborated.''
</P>
<P>
   But an attorney for Branch Davidian survivors and relatives, Jim
Brannon, said he believes Vector's analysis is ''fatally flawed.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Vector was either incompetent or they willfully sabotaged the
test,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The fire started several hours into an FBI operation intended to
end a 51-day siege. The government has long contended the Davidians
themselves set fire to the retreat and caused their own deaths,
whether by fire or gunshots.
</P>
<P>
   Vector was hired to conduct the test by Special Counsel John
Danforth, whom Attorney General Janet Reno appointed to oversee an
independent investigation into the standoff and fire.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Danforth said he would have no comment on
Vector's report.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth's appointment followed revelations that the FBI,
contradicting a position it had taken for six years, used
potentially incendiary devices on the last day of the standoff.

<HEADLINE> Study: Kids' Pneumonia Deaths Down  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   The children of baby boomers are highly unlikely to
die of
pneumonia, researchers reported today.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pneumonia deaths among children dropped 97 percent between 1939
and 1996 -- from 24,637 two generations ago to 800, according to a
report in today's New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Widespread immunizations and government health care programs for
poor children are probably major reasons, according to researchers
at the National Center for Infectious Diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The American Lung Association credits penicillin, which was
discovered in 1928 but not available in quantity until 1944, with
moving pneumonia out of the most common cause of death in the
United States.

<HEADLINE> LPGA Back in Music City Area  </HEADLINE>
By TERESA M. WALKER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKLIN, Tenn. (AP) -- After coming to Nashville for 12 straight
years and winning three times, Meg Mallon had a hard time driving
past her usual hotel for the LPGA Tour's new spot 15 miles south of
Music City.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was very strange,'' Mallon said. ''We're just so happy to
come back to Nashville. When we saw this facility, it's just a
fabulous facility.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of playing 54 holes at the Hermitage Golf Course, she
will tee off today with players like Karrie Webb and Nancy Lopez 30
miles away in the 72-hole, Electrolux USA Championship at The
Legends Club's Ironhorse Course.
</P>
<P>
   It looked like the LPGA would lose Nashville as a stop a year
ago when Sara Lee pulled its sponsorship of an event that lasted 12
years and was the first major professional sporting event in Music
City.
</P>
<P>
   Tour officials held off announcing its 2000 schedule, giving
Nashville time. The new 72-hole tournament wasn't put together
until last November when Raycom Sports put together an agreement to
run the event with Electrolux as the sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes a course changes. Sometimes the sponsor changes,''
Mallon said. ''This time both happened. It's definitely different
for me. But it's still Nashville, and I still have such fond
memories.''
</P>
<P>
   Those memories include the late Heather Farr, who is remembered
with a statue in front of the Hermitage's clubhouse. Farr, who died
of breast cancer in 1993, had attempted a comeback there.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville also is a very popular stop, luring the top players
every year with its mix of country music celebrities and
hospitality. Singer Vince Gill and his new wife, Amy Grant, are the
official hosts for this week's tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Lopez even postponed surgery to remove her gallbladder
until next week just to play here.
</P>
<P>
   ''That just goes to show how great the Nashville area and fans
are to Nancy and the rest of us,'' Webb said.
</P>
<P>
   The Electrolux will feature a very different course. The
6,479-yard, par 72 course plays long, and undulating greens likely
will prevent the shootouts that regularly forced playoffs to
determine the Sara Lee winner.
</P>
<P>
   ''This week it's going to be completely different as far as the
golf course goes. Hopefully, I'll have success in a different
way,'' Mallon said.
</P>
<P>
   The favorite again is Webb, who already has won four times on
the LPGA Tour this year and is the leading money winner. She also
has won two non-tour events, including last weekend in Japan.
Mallon said fatigue might be Webb's biggest enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ''That'll hold her back for about two holes,'' Mallon said.
</P>
<P>
   Gill said he hopes both players and fans will be forgiving as
tournament officials work out any kinks left from planning
everything in just five months. He thinks the tournament, which now
includes his yearly pro-am called The Vinny and another pro-am
hosted by Grant, has lots of potential.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're just putting one foot in front of the other,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Athletics 7, Angels 4  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Ben Grieve had three hits, including a
solo homer and a go-ahead single in a four-run ninth inning as the
Oakland Athletics beat the Anaheim Angels 7-4 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Grieve, batting in the cleanup spot for the second night in a
row and second time of his career, singled off Mark Petkovsek (2-2)
for a 4-3 lead after a single by Ryan Christenson, a sacrifice by
Randy Velarde and an intentional walk.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Giambi followed a walk to Matt Stairs with a two-run
single, making it 6-3, and Eric Chavez added an RBI single for a
four-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Athletics rallied after their shaky bullpen allowed two runs
to tie it 3-3 in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland rookie Mark Mulder allowed one run on five hits in 7 2-3
innings. After he left in the eighth with Oakland leading 3-1, two
outs and a runner on first, Tim Salmon greeted reliever T.J.
Mathews with an RBI double, narrowing the gap to one.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Isringhausen replaced Mathews, and Garret Anderson doubled
to score Salmon. The blown save was Isringhausen's third in nine
chances this year and the fourth by Oakland's bullpen in the last
eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Isringhausen (2-2) still got the win, pitching 1 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Mulder, who lowered his ERA to 4.83, has four no-decisions since
winning his big league debut in an 8-5 victory over Cleveland on
April 18, his only decision so far.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old left-hander, the second player taken in the 1998
draft, struck out six and walked one against the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Tejada's two-run single off Kent Bottenfield gave Oakland
a 2-0 lead in the second. Grieve, who has 21 RBIs in his last 14
games, homered against Bottenfield in the third to stake Oakland to
a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Darin Erstad's leadoff homer in the third, his fifth, gave the
Angels their only run off Mulder. Erstad had three hits, including
an RBI single in the ninth, to raise his average to .385.
</P>
<P>
   Mulder got out of a jam in the fourth after the umpires ruled
that a fan touched an apparent run-scoring double by Troy Glaus
that short-hopped the low fence in the left-field corner.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who led off with a single, came home on Glaus' hit.
But he was sent back to third by second-base umpire and crew chief
Al Clark after all four umps huddled and ruled it a ground-rule
double.
</P>
<P>
   Replays appeared to show a fan leaned over the fence and reached
for the ball, but did not touch it.
</P>
<P>
   Edgard Clemente, the next batter, grounded to third, and
Anderson was tagged out in a rundown. Matt Walbeck followed with a
single, with Glaus holding at third, and Trent Durrington grounded
into a double play with the bases loaded to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Anaheim batting coach Mickey Hatcher was ejected
by Clark for yelling from the dugout about the ground-rule double.
Hatcher charged onto the field toward Clark, but Anaheim first
baseman Mo Vaughn restrained the coach with a bear hug, eventually
wrestling him to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield allowed three runs on eight hits in 6 2-3 innings.
Often going deep into the count, he threw 132 pitches, struck out
six and walked four.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Oakland center fielder Terrence Long was scratched from the
lineup after being hit in the mouth by a thrown ball during batting
practice. The injury was not believed to be serious. Christenson
replaced Long in center and in the leadoff spot. ... The Angels
optioned struggling rookie right-hander Ramon Ortiz to Triple-A
Edmonton and recalled Jarrod Washburn from the Trappers. Ortiz was
2-2 with a 6.90 ERA in six starts with Anaheim. ... Anaheim manager
Mike Scioscia said he expects right-hander Ken Hill, placed on the
15-day DL after straining a rib cage muscle pitching Tuesday, to be
sidelined for more than the two weeks.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 2, Dodgers 1  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Randy Johnson's perfect start to the 2000 season
is over, but he remained unbeaten and the Arizona Diamondbacks tied
a club record with seven straight victories by defeating the Los
Angeles Dodgers 2-1 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In a dramatic duel with Kevin Brown, Johnson allowed one run on
a season-high eight hits but struck out 13 and walked just one
before both starters left the game after eight innings and the
score tied at 1.
</P>
<P>
   Consecutive singles by Andy Fox, Travis Lee and Tony Womack with
no outs scored the winning run in the ninth off reliever Terry
Adams (2-3) as Arizona finished a 6-0 homestand with sweeps of San
Diego and the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Byun-Hyun Kim (1-1) gave a hit and committed an error
in the ninth but struck out three to get the victory. Seventeen of
the last 19 outs Kim has recorded have been by strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who had won his first seven starts, has an ERA of 0.95.
</P>
<P>
   Brown allowed one run and six hits, struck out six and walked
three. In his four starts since coming back from a broken finger,
Brown has allowed a four earned runs but is just 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers nursed a 1-0 lead on Todd Hundley's second-inning
homer until Arizona tied it in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Brown retired the first two batters in the seventh and had an
0-2 count on Jay Bell but walked him. Luis Gonzalez, who was
3-for-3, followed with a double to deep left-center, scoring Bell
from first.
</P>
<P>
   The sixth matchup between Johnson and Brown ended in a draw.
Johnson is 1-2 and Brown 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has struck out at least 10 in seven of eight starts and
has 88 strikeouts this season. He increased his strikeout total to
2,781 to pass Frank Tanana for 15th in the career list.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Green, who bats left-handed, was 3-for-4. Going in, lefties
were 2-for-25 against Johnson this season.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson struck out Adrian Beltre to lead off the second, but
Hundley hit a 2-2 pitch into the left field seats to make it 1-0.
Jose Vizciano, who was 3-for-4, singled and moved to second on
Brown's sacrifice bunt, then F.P. Santangelo singled to put runners
at first and third. Mark Grudzielanek lined out to right to end the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros missed a home run by inches in the sixth when the
ball bounced off the top of the right-field fence. Bernard Gilkey
almost caught the ball, but it bounced free for a double.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks stranded eight runners in the first three
innings. They had the bases loaded with two outs in the third when
Bernard Gilkey, who had hit .400 against Brown in his career,
struck out. Gilkey was 0-for-4 and struck out three times.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Arizona's Matt Williams had an X-ray taken of his injured
right foot Wednesday night and was cleared to begin light jogging
Thursday. The All-Star third baseman has been out all season after
breaking a bone in the foot when he fouled a ball off of it in a
spring training game. ... The Dodgers placed RHP Mike Fetters on
the 15-day disabled list (sore right elbow) and recalled LHP Onan
Masaoka from Triple-A Albuquerque. .... Los Angeles is three games
into a 12-game road trip, its longest of the season, with stops
ahead in St. Louis, Chicago and Florida. ... Arizona plays its
Triple-A affiliate in Tucson in an exhibition game Thursday before
a nine-game road trip.

<HEADLINE> Los Alamos Evacuated for Brush Fire  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF SIMONS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- A blaze that had been set to clear brush
but raged out of control over the weekend spread into Los Alamos
and burned at least 30 homes Wednesday, forcing the evacuation of
all 11,000 residents in this town, the site of America's most
storied nuclear laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday night, the intense fire had forced firefighters to
pull back from whole neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are in a retreat situation,'' said county spokesman Bill
Lehman said, adding the blaze had spread into two west-side
subdivisions and crews were running out of water.
</P>
<P>
   An aerial view of the city showed pockets of neighborhoods up in
flames. The office of Gov. Gary Johnson said he had seen at least
30 homes in flames and firefighters told him at least 50 homes had
burned.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you have to evacuate an entire town, it's got to be one
of the worst fires in New Mexico (history),'' Lehman said.
</P>
<P>
   The fire also forced authorities to ask residents in parts of
Espanola, about 10 miles from Los Alamos, to leave their homes,
Mayor Richard Lucero said.
</P>
<P>
   Flames had marched to a tree-covered ridge overlooking downtown
Los Alamos, lighting the night sky. Billows of flame leapt from
treetops and smoke rose 20,000 feet above the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Homes in western and northern parts of the city began burning in
late afternoon. The extent of the damage was not immediately known
and officials could not give an estimate of how many homes had
burned. Overall, 4,500 acres had burned by Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, with wind gusts up to 50 mph driving the
flames through ponderosa pine, police, sheriff's and fire
department officials went door-to-door and urged people to pack up
and get out as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Alamos nuclear laboratory has been closed since Monday,
and lab officials said explosives and radioactive material stored
there were protected in fireproof facilities. Late Wednesday, the
lab declared a general emergency as brush fires swept through the
area, but no explosive material was affected and damage appeared to
be light.
</P>
<P>
   Even the fire command post was forced to re-establish itself
farther away from the fire. Wednesday night, a school bus stood by
at the new command post, a police headquarters, in case they or
anyone else needed to evacuate again.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fire was so intense they were told to pull back,'' Lehman
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said firefighters were frustrated, but ''there was just
nothing we could do, because of the wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Winds died down Wednesday night, but they were expected to pick
up again Thursday with gusts of at least 50 mph.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton declared the city a disaster area, giving the
Federal Emergency Management Agency discretion to use whatever
resources are necessary to handle the emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the first time I felt fear,'' said Jaret McDonald, 28,
who had been evacuated three times before for fires. ''When you're
against Mother Nature, you can't contain it. You'll lose every
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Water-dropping helicopters and airplanes dropping pink fire
retardant bombarded the blaze. Los Alamos County spokesman Bill
Lehman said efforts were hampered by winds blowing embers and
firebrands and starting spot fires.
</P>
<P>
   The fire burned out of control after the National Park Service
set it last week to clear brush at the nearby Bandelier National
Monument. Five hundred homes were evacuated Sunday night, and 3,700
acres had burned by Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Los Alamos, 70 miles north of Albuquerque, is essentially a
company town for the federal laboratory. It sprang up in the 1940s
as the base of operations for the Manhattan Project, which built
the atomic bomb. There are still military barracks and
military-style housing in Los Alamos, along with relatively
upscale, newer developments.
</P>
<P>
   The fire moved closer to the laboratory Wednesday, and a
research building was in its path, fire spokesman Jim Paxon said.
Laboratory officials were prepared to fight the fire, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the blaze was not near any buildings containing nuclear
materials, ''and those buildings are rated to survive severe fires,
747 crashes, those kinds of things,'' lab spokesman Jim Danneskiold
said. ''They're bunkers, basically.''
</P>
<P>
   The emergency declared late Wednesday came after grash and brush
fires sprang up at three areas in the lab's southwestern quadrant.
The lab's weapons-engineering tritium facility at Technical Area 16
was swept by fire, but the masonry building did not catch fire.
Bunkers storing explosives at TA-16 were unaffected, lab officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Alamos Inn was among the homes and businesses forced to
evacuate Wednesday afternoon. Spokeswoman Brenda Lucero noted that
some of the 40 guests had been staying in the hotel because they
had evacuated their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's black smoke -- smoke everywhere,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many customers at Katherine's Restaurant in Los Alamos' White
Rock area were alerted to the evacuation by calls on their cell
phones at lunch. ''They're just jumping out of their seats and
leaving,'' said waitress Chris Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury hotels in Santa Fe offered discounts to evacuees: $25 a
night for rooms that normally go for as high as $239. There was a
great outpouring of support. Many people offered their homes as
shelter and donated food, clothing and blankets.
</P>
<P>
   The blowup was the worst thing firefighters could have imagined
after the Park Service set the fire. At a news conference Monday,
park Superintendent Roy Weaver took responsibility for the fire and
said conditions had seemed right for a controlled burn.
</P>
<P>
   However, a copy of the special weather forecast faxed to
Bandelier shortly before the fire was started, and obtained by The
Associated Press, was practically a blueprint for a spreading fire.
</P>
<P>
   The forecast told park officials that there was a maximum
potential for fire growth, that winds were about to increase, that
temperatures were about to rise and that the potential for the
usual increase in nighttime humidity was diminished.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver had to evacuate Wednesday and could not be reached for
comment by the AP. However, CNN reported that Weaver said he never
saw the forecast.
</P>
<P>
   While Los Alamos faced disaster, fire victims in Ruidoso, a
resort 200 miles south, had better news. The 8,600-acre fire had
forced up to 400 people to flee their homes Monday, but the wind
eased Wednesday and most residents were allowed to return home.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've caught a break,'' fire spokeswoman Karen Miranda said.

<HEADLINE> Banker, Boss Compete for N.D. Gov.  </HEADLINE>
By DALE WETZEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- Imagine competing against your own boss
for a big promotion -- and a pay cut.
</P>
<P>
   That's one way to look at this year's race for governor in North
Dakota, where the president of the nation's only state-owned bank
is opposing the attorney general who helped give him his job.
</P>
<P>
   John Hoeven, who has run the bank since 1993, once praised
Democratic Attorney General Heidi Heitkamp as among the state's
most capable officials. But since he switched to the Republican
Party, Hoeven has taken to describing her as a career bureaucrat.
</P>
<P>
   Heitkamp, finishing her second term after six years as tax
commissioner, is seeking to become the state's first female
governor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there's probably a few people out there who will say,
'Boy, I don't know that that is something a woman ought to be
doing.' Occasionally, you'll get a comment here or there,''
Heitkamp said. ''But I think for the most part, this is about
vision, and leadership, and who can get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the nation's older, more rural states -- almost one of
every five North Dakotans is 60 or older -- the race matches up two
people who would be among the nation's youngest governors. Hoeven,
at 43, is a year younger than Heitkamp.
</P>
<P>
   Neither candidate faces opposition in North Dakota's June 13
primary election.
</P>
<P>
   Hoeven reports to the state Industrial Commission, a
three-member panel made up of Heitkamp, Republican Gov. Ed Schafer
and Roger Johnson, the Democratic agriculture commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   He is paid $144,972 annually, while Heitkamp makes $65,753. The
new governor will earn $83,013.
</P>
<P>
   Heitkamp says Hoeven's challenge doesn't bother her.
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as he understands the boundaries, and as long as he
does the work of the bank, I don't have a complaint about it,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of North Dakota was founded in 1919, born out of
farmers' frustration with tight credit, high interest rates and low
wheat prices. Both the bank and a state-owned flour mill, which
opened in Grand Forks in 1922, have since become part of North
Dakota's political fabric. And the bank reported record profits
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Hoeven is relying on a campaign blueprint used by Schafer,
himself a political newcomer in 1992 who emphasized his business
background in two successful campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans regarded Schafer as a cinch for a third term and
begged him to seek it, but the governor decided eight years in the
job was enough.
</P>
<P>
   Hoeven, who worked at his family's Minot bank before taking the
state job, said his emphasis will be on bringing prosperity to
rural communities, many of which shrank or stagnated during the
1990s. Last year, 52 percent of taxable sales and purchases came
from four cities -- Fargo, Bismarck, Grand Forks and Minot.
</P>
<P>
   Schafer ''has really got us focused on building and diversifying
the economy,'' Hoeven said. ''That effort has really started to
take hold in our larger communities. Now we have to focus on
pushing that development out into our small towns.''
</P>
<P>
   During Schafer's administration, North Dakota's number of
wage-earning jobs off the farm grew 17 percent, and Hoeven believes
the state's economy has become less dependent on its mainstays of
agriculture and energy production.
</P>
<P>
   Heitkamp says North Dakota's economic health has not been as
robust as that of other states in the region. Her assessment is
shared by the state's own economic forecaster, Dismal Sciences Inc.
of West Chester, Pa., which the state budget office uses to help
compile tax collection estimates.
</P>
<P>
   In an analysis earlier this year, the company ranked North
Dakota's employment growth 49th among the states, and described its
economic performance as ''lackluster.''
</P>
<P>
   And there's more reason to worry. Census data published last
December estimated that North Dakota was one of only three states
to lose population during the 1990s, declining 0.8 percent to
633,666. And for 1998, the most recent year available, per capita
personal income was $21,708, far below the national average of
$26,482.
</P>

<HEADLINE> 'Millionaire' contestant sues over allegedly ambiguous question  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It might not have been in the stars for Robert
Gelbman to win $1 million on ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'' but
now he is hoping to get more than that in court.
</P>
<P>
   Gelbman, of Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., says a poorly worded
question about zodiac signs cost him a shot at $1 million on the
television quiz show and he has filed a $2 million lawsuit against
the show's producers.
</P>
<P>
   Gelbman, 34, was a contestant on the show that was taped Aug. 17
and aired Aug. 18. He was eliminated at the $32,000 level by a
question about the zodiac. He left with a $1,000 check that he says
he still hasn't cashed.
</P>
<P>
   The question: ''Beginning in January, which of the following
signs of the zodiac comes last -- (a) Aquarius (b) Aries (c) Leo (d)
Scorpio?''
</P>
<P>
   Gelbman said he was thinking out loud and was ready to choose a
final answer when ''somebody in the audience gasped. That scared me
so I used my 50-50. I said Aquarius, and they said that was
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ''After I left the hot seat and went backstage, I told them,
'You just robbed me of $31,000,''' said Gelbman, who says he is a
former student at Antioch College in Ohio and member of the high-IQ
society, Mensa.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem is that the question doesn't specify whether its
based on the zodiac cycle or the calendar year,'' Gelbman
explained. ''If it's based on the zodiac, then my answer is correct
because out of those choices, Aquarius is the last sign.''
</P>
<P>
   To remove ambiguity, said Gelbman, a computer programmer, the
question should have asked: ''Beginning in January, which of the
following signs comes last in the calendar year?''
</P>
<P>
   Gelbman said he asked for another chance as a ''Millionaire''
contestant but his request was denied.
</P>
<P>
   In papers filed Tuesday in Manhattan's State Supreme Court,
Gelbman says the show ''unreasonably'' prevented him from
proceeding to the next level, and they ''failed to follow their own
rules and procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit names ABC, Walt Disney Co. and a Disney subsidiary,
Valleycrest Productions, as defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Sewell, director of media relations for the ABC television
network, said her office had not seen the lawsuit and could not
comment on it.
</P>
<P>
   Gelbman, originally from Belle Harbor, Queens, said his lawyer
tried last November to get him another appearance on ''Who Wants to
Be a Millionaire?'' At this point, he says, he would not accept a
chance to become a contestant.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Gelbman wants the $2 million he sued for. He accuses
the show's producers of intentionally inflicting ''severe emotional
distress and harm'' on him and breaching their contract with him.
</P>
<P>
   Gelbman said he was, coincidentally, the next contestant after
David Honea, a doctoral student in computer engineering from
Raleigh, N.C., who had won $32,000 but was stopped by a question
about the Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   The $64,000 question asked which of the five Great Lakes is the
second largest in area after Lake Superior. Honea, 31, said Lake
Huron. The show's host, Regis Philbin, told him that the correct
answer was Lake Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   After the show other contestants urged Honea to talk to the
show's producers. After several hours of fact-checking, executive
producer Michael Davies told Honea he was correct and the show was
wrong.

<HEADLINE> Big Game Winners Keeping Quiet  </HEADLINE>
By JIM IRWIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UTICA, Mich. (AP) -- The Big Game fever has finally broken.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly three months and 23 consecutive drawings without a
jackpot winner, lottery officials announced that two tickets
matched all the numbers drawn Tuesday night. Somewhere, at least
two people are figuring out their moves in claiming $363 million,
the biggest prize in U.S. lottery history.
</P>
<P>
   One of the tickets that beat odds of more than 76 million to 1
was sold at a gas station in Lake Zurich, Ill., 30 miles northwest
of Chicago. The other was sold at Mr. K's Party Shoppe, located in
a strip mall near this quiet suburb 20 miles north of Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Neither winner immediately stepped forward publicly.
</P>
<P>
   But Michigan Lottery officials said they were contacted
Wednesday by a ''remarkably quite calm'' man they believe holds one
of the winning tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The man didn't identify himself, but the validation numbers he
recited from his ticket matched the winner, lottery spokeswoman
Sarah Lapshan said. He didn't say where he was from or whether the
ticket was his alone or bought for a group.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm pretty confident this is the winning ticket,'' Lapshan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois Lottery officials said they had not been contacted by
anyone claiming to hold the other winning ticket, which was bought
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We certainly would understand if they were going to get some
good financial advice, legal advice'' before coming forward,
Illinois Lottery Director Lori Montana said.
</P>
<P>
   The winners have up to one year to claim their prize. Unlike
some state lotteries, jackpot winners in the seven-state Big Game
are publicly identified.
</P>
<P>
   The winning numbers drawn Tuesday were 1, 2, 12, 33, 37 and Big
Money Ball 4. To win, a ticket had to match all six numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The drawing capped days of frenzy that sent lottery veterans and
first-timers alike scurrying for $1 chances at the big dream. Some
bought single tickets; others spent hundreds or even thousands.
Some went it alone, while others joined with friends and co-workers
for more chances.
</P>
<P>
   By the time it was over, the states that jointly offer the Big
Game had sold some 358 million tickets since the previous jackpot --
$15 million, in the Feb. 11 drawing -- was claimed by a resident of
Warren, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   How much the winners will take home depends on state taxes in
Michigan and Illinois. Lottery officials in both states estimated
each ticket could be worth about $7 million per year before taxes
in 26 annual payments.
</P>
<P>
   John Sweeney, owner of Sweeney's Citgo in Lake Zurich, struck it
rich in the form of a $1.8 million bonus for selling a jackpot
winner. Under Michigan's different rules, Mr. K's owner George
Kassab gets $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   The big jackpot easily topped the previous American record, a
$295.7 million Powerball jackpot split two years ago by 13
machinists in Westerville, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The world lottery record is $1.2 billion, set in December by
Spain's El Gordo, or the Fat One, but that game spreads itself thin
by awarding thousands of prizes.

Appeals Court To Hear Elian Case
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- The judicial panel from the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals scheduled a hearing Thursday to determine if 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez
is too young to seek asylum over the objections of his father. So far,
immigration officials and a federal judge in Miami have rejected the asylum
application signed by Elian and filed by his great uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez.
Lawyers for both the U.S. government and Juan Miguel Gonzalez, the boy's father,
say Elian is not mature enough to make such choices. They say the father is the
one to decide for his son.

   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Members of the South Carolina state House voted
Wednesday to remove the Confederate flag from atop the Statehouse dome. The
Senate already has approved a similar measure to remove the flag and put one up
at a monument on the Statehouse grounds. Democratic Gov. Jim Hodges has said he
supports removal. Lawmakers debated late into Wednesday night, with supporters
of the bill pleading with their fellow House members to approve the plan. The
bill passed 63-56. A procedural vote will be held Thursday before it goes back
to the Senate, which has to agree on minor differences in the two versions.

   BEIJING (AP) -- Followers of the banned Falun Gong sect honored the birthday
of their movement's founder Thursday, protesting by the dozens in Tiananmen
Square only to meet swift and sometimes forceful arrest by Chinese police.
Followers tried to unfurl banners and raise their arms in a meditation pose used
by the group. Plainclothes police darted across the vast plaza to quell the
separate acts of civil disobedience by small groups of sect members. Police vans
raced back and forth to pick up the captured. At least 50 people were taken away
within about 90 minutes.

<HEADLINE> GOP Pushes For China Trade Bill  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The top House Republican vote counter says it
will take ''traditional hand-to-hand combat'' to win passage this
month of the administration's bill to establish permanent favorable
trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   The assertion by Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, came after an
internal GOP head count showed Republican support for the
legislation to be shallower than sponsors had anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay said ''too many'' members still are listing themselves as
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Both Democratic and Republican sponsors of the trade legislation
expect the House vote to be extremely close. Passage requires 218
votes if all 435 members vote.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay would not discuss details of the head count done by his
office.
</P>
<P>
   But other GOP officials privately said that the tally suggested
Republican leaders are now looking at from 140-145 expected
Republican ''yes'' votes, down from the 150 level usually
mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Democratic supporters said they doubted they
could line up more than 70-80 Democratic votes in the face of a
massive lobbying campaign against the bill by organized labor and
environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''That would not be enough,'' DeLay said. He said Democrats need
to furnish between 85 and 90 votes for the measure to pass.
</P>
<P>
   As DeLay issued his new, less optimistic assessment of the vote
situation, sponsors scrambled to come up with compromise side
legislation designed to make the underlying trade bill more
palatable to wavering members.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing to be gaining the most support was a proposal by Reps.
Sander Levin, D-Mich., and Doug Bereuter, R-Neb. to set up a
watchdog commission to monitor human rights in China.
</P>
<P>
   The commission -- jointly appointed by Congress and the president
-- could recommend trade sanctions against Beijing if abuses of
human rights or worker protections continued.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will place an ongoing and focused spotlight on China,
rather than the temporary and diffuse spotlight of an annual
review,'' Levin told the House International Relations Committee on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The main China trade bill would end the current practice of
annual renewal of China's trade status and grant it what is known
as ''permanent normal trade relations,'' the same low-tariff access
to U.S. markets now routinely extended to nearly all other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also ease China's entry into the World Trade
Organization, the Geneva-based organization that sets rules for
international trade and settles trade disputes among its members.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and congressional sponsors preferred
legislation without any such side agreements -- but conceded they
might have to support such a mechanism as the price for passage.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reality is we need some more votes,'' conceded House Ways
and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, the top House
sponsor of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Archer and other Republican leaders stressed, however, that the
language would have to be carefully crafted to attract wavering
Democrats without losing GOP support.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay told reporters that he still believes the China trade bill
will win House approval in the end. With the vote still two weeks
away, many members are still not focused on it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said his headcount ''shows we have a very tough assignment
ahead of us. It is going to be difficult. We're going to have to do
our traditional hand-to-hand combat.''
</P>
<P>
   The trade vote is only seen as close in the House. In the
Senate, which will take it up in June, the measure enjoys wide
bipartisan support.

<HEADLINE> Halle Berry Fined For Leaving Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Actress Halle Berry was fined
$13,500 and placed on three years' probation after pleading no
contest to leaving the scene of an accident.
</P>
<P>
   ''Your honor, I would like the court to know that I have taken
this matter very seriously from the very beginning. I am pleased
that this can be resolved,'' Berry, 31, said in court Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Charles G. Ruben also ordered Berry to
perform 200 hours of community service.
</P>
<P>
   Berry was driving a rented sport utility vehicle that ran a red
light and collided with another car at a West Hollywood
intersection on Feb. 23, then drove off, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The other driver, Hetal Raythatha, suffered injuries including a
broken wrist and is suing the actress for unspecified damages.
Berry was treated for a cut on her forehead.
</P>
<P>
   Berry's attorney, Blair Berk, said prosecutors found no evidence
that the actress was under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

<HEADLINE> Report: Army Inquiry Finds Support  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Army investigators have found support for a
charge by the Army's highest-ranking woman that another Army
general touched her in a sexual manner and tried to kiss her in a
Pentagon office in 1996, according to published reports Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post and subsequently The New York Times reported
that investigators found Lt. Gen. Claudia J. Kennedy described the
incident to friends and colleagues soon after it occurred, although
she did not file a sexual harassment complaint at the time. Both
papers quoted officials who were not identified as saying
investigators found the supporting accounts by Kennedy's friends
and colleagues to be specific and persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Larry G. Smith probably will receive a reprimand and be
forced to retire if the findings are accepted by the Army's
leadership, the Post said.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Army spokesman Maj. Gen. John Meyer told The Associated
Press he had no comment on the newspaper reports or the status of
the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The supporting accounts are included in a report compiled by the
Army inspector general's office that is expected to be approved by
senior officers by the end of next week, the Post said. Smith will
likely be given a copy of the report without the names of the
witnesses and will then have time to offer any contrary evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's charge, leaked in March, was first made privately last
year after the Army announced that Smith would become deputy
inspector general, the No. 2 job in the Army office responsible for
investigating wrongdoing. Since the accusation was leveled, Smith's
move into the job has been on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a career armor officer and a decorated veteran of the
Vietnam War, had been commander of the Army Security Assistance
Command in Alexandria, Va., until last October. Before that he
managed the Army's modernization program for the Saudi Arabian
National Guard. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in June
1966 and has been a general officer since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy is due to retire this summer. In 1997 she served on a
special task force that examined sexual harassment in the Army and
concluded that it existed ''throughout the Army, crossing gender,
rank and racial lines.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy case is the latest in a string of embarrassing
sexual misconduct cases in the Army. Coincidentally, one earlier
case involved another two-star general from the inspector general's
office. Maj. Gen. David Hale served in the position of deputy
inspector general for only four months in 1997 before he was
allowed to retire after being accused of having had sex with wives
of subordinate officers. Hale later was called out of retirement,
charged with misconduct and demoted one rank after pleading guilty.

<HEADLINE> Jury Decides What Edwards Should Pay  </HEADLINE>
By NATALIE GOTT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Former Gov. Edwin Edwards isn't letting
the prospect of spending the rest of his life in prison and
millions of dollars in penalties on racketeering charges get him
down.
</P>
<P>
   He insisted he did nothing wrong Wednesday after a jury
recommended that he and three co-defendants forfeit nearly $2.6
million of the money they got from businessmen applying for
riverboat casino licenses.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendation came after Edwards was convicted of extorting
kickbacks in a scheme lasting from 1991 through 1997. He was
convicted Tuesday with his son, Stephen Edwards, and three others
of racketeering and fraud. Two other defendants, including a state
senator, were acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, 72, also could be fined $4.5 million and sentenced to
up 250 years in prison. No sentencing date has been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Outside court, Edwards said he could probably come close to
raising enough cash to pay both the fines and the forfeiture
amount. He said he would have to sell some property, but gave no
further details.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he wasn't worried about going to prison and tried
to defend his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ''There isn't a penny missing from the state treasury,'' Edwards
said. ''There are no allegations and certainly no evidence that I
at any time took anything voluntarily from the people of this
state. And I want the taxpayers and the citizens to know that.''
</P>
<P>
   His 35-year-old wife, Candy, started crying as he answered
questions about whether he might die in prison. Edwards held her
hand, but remained upbeat and continued to display his trademark
sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Candy will be all right financially, but she'll never again
find anyone as wonderful as I am,'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Frank Polozola will make the final decision
on how much the four defendants subject to the forfeiture order
should pay. Prosecutors had sought $3.1 million. Polozola did not
indicate when he would issue a decision.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Eddie Jordan said the conviction proves Louisiana
citizens are fed up with corrupt politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ''The citizens of this state expect their leaders to live within
the law. And when those leaders break the law, the citizens of this
state expect those leaders to be held accountable,'' Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards faces more legal troubles June 19, when he will be tried
on federal charges accusing him of helping to arrange a generous
deal in 1996 for the head of a failed insurance company liquidated
by the state.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards is also charged with trying to illegally record the
conversations of FBI agents who were investigating him in 1997. No
trial date has been set in that case.
</P>
<P>
   By his own count, Edwards has been the subject of almost two
dozen state or federal investigations going back to his days in
Congress in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, he was charged with racketeering involving health
care investments. His 1985 federal trial ended in a hung jury; he
was acquitted in a retrial a year later.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards served two terms as governor in the 1970s but left
office because of a state ban on serving three straight terms. He
was elected again in 1983 and in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Helps Africans With AIDS  </HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After nearly identical language was removed
from an African trade bill, President Clinton is using his
authority to help AIDS-ravaged Africa get inexpensive drugs for
treating the disease.
</P>
<P>
   An executive order issued Wednesday by Clinton uses basically
the same wording that was struck from the trade bill before it was
passed by the House last week, 309-110.
</P>
<P>
   Now before the Senate, the bill had faced the threat of a
filibuster from Sen. Diane Feinstein, D-Calif., one of the authors
of the stripped out AIDS language
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's order states that the U.S. government will not try to
overturn patent laws or policies adopted by sub-Saharan African
governments that promote access to HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals and
medical technologies.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said the
administration was ''very disappointed'' by the decision to remove
the AIDS provision from the trade bill, prompting Clinton to carry
through with an executive order he had been considering for some
time.
</P>
<P>
   World Trade Organization rules give countries some flexibility
in importing and production matters that address public health
concerns. In this case, it has allowed AIDS-stricken countries to
produce or import cheap, generic drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. pharmaceutical industry had lobbied extensively against
the AIDS language
</P>
<P>
   ''We recognize that AIDS is a major problem, but weakening
intellectual property rights is not the solution,'' Alan Holmer,
president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of
America, said of Clinton's action.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein, however, said the industry's opposition was based on
its desire ''to squeeze every last drop of profits from the
suffering of millions of HIV/AIDS victims in sub-Saharan Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that some 34 million people in sub-Saharan Africa have
been infected with the disease since the onset of the AIDS
epidemic, and 11.5 million have died, 83 percent of the world's
total AIDS-related deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Jacobs of AIDS Action, a national advocacy group, welcomed
Clinton's order as a ''bold important first step.'' He said the
best medicines to fight AIDS ''are outrageously expensive. Almost
nobody in developing countries can afford these therapies, yet
that's where the epidemic is raging.''
</P>
<P>
   Barshefsky said Clinton's order ''strikes a proper balance''
between the need of African countries to respond to the AIDs crisis
and the need to ensure that the patent rights of drug manufacturers
are protected.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., on Tuesday had
anticipated Clinton's action.
</P>
<P>
   ''There seems to be a pattern now of him doing executive orders
that exceed what he should be doing,'' Lott said at a news
conference. ''That should be done legislatively ... He doesn't make
the laws. And so I would hope that he would be careful about doing
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The trade bill, five years in the making, still faces opposition
in the Senate, primarily from lawmakers from textile-producing
states.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would expand apparel trade for 48 sub-Saharan African
nations and 25 Caribbean nations. Clothing made from U.S. yarn and
fabric could enter the country without duty or quotas.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The trade bill number is H.R. 434.

<HEADLINE> Elian Look-Alike Sought For Film  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Movie producers are looking for a photogenic
6-year-old boy, with short hair who likes playing on a swingset.
</P>
<P>
   Producers announced Wednesday that filming will begin in July on
a movie about the Elian Gonzalez case. ''Elian: The True Story of
Elian Gonzalez,'' will focus on his flight from Cuba and the
custody battle after he was rescued at sea, co-producer Sam
Lupowitz said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lupowitz said filming should finish by September and the movie
likely will air on U.S. television this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Lupowitz said he and co-producer Menahem Golan hope it will be
the first dramatized account of Elian, the focus of a custody
dispute since last November. CBS is developing a movie or
miniseries on Elian's story, which it has targeted for broadcast
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was rescued at sea in November after his mother and 10
others died when their boat sank en route to the United State from
Cuba. He was staying with relatives in Miami until last month, when
federal agents raided the home and reunited Elian with his father,
who wants the boy to return with him to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Elian remains in the United States pending a court ruling on
relatives' request for a political asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is based on public records and news accounts of
Elian's story, Lupowitz said.

<HEADLINE> Top Execs: Good Times Will Continue  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER, AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. economy should slow a bit this year
but still turn in a record-breaking 10th year of uninterrupted
growth, the nation's top business executives are forecasting.
</P>
<P>
   The Business Council, composed of chief executives of the
nation's largest corporations, issued a revised outlook Wednesday
that predicted slower growth and higher inflation this year. But
the executives saw nothing on the horizon that will derail the
current expansion, which in February became the longest in history.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States clearly continues to defy expectations and
council members don't see too much change over the near term,'' the
group said in a report presented by Sanford I. Weill, chairman of
financial giant Citigroup.
</P>
<P>
   The executives said in the current economic good times, the top
priority for the Clinton administration and Congress should be
paying down the national debt but saw the administration's forecast
of total elimination of the debt held by the public by 2010 as too
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   For the economy overall, the executives said they were expecting
a slowdown this year after three straight years in which the gross
domestic product expanded by more than 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve, which has already raised interest rates
five times in an effort to slow the economy and keep inflation
under control, is widely expected to raise rates again next Tuesday
given that the GDP grew at a brisk annual rate of 5.4 percent in
the first three months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The business executives believe that inflation will increase
from last year's 2.7 percent rise in consumer prices but remain in
a moderate range for this year and coming years below 3.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even though they were forecasting a rise in overall inflation,
most council members said their own firms' pricing power is either
weaker than it was six months ago or little changed and they said
the big jump in oil prices has had little effect on their own
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the council members reported that labor market
conditions remained tight and many said that they were increasing
salaries to retain workers or boosting benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The business executives were evenly split over whether Democrat
Al Gore or Republican George W. Bush will win the White House in
November, while a slim majority believed that the Republicans would
retain their majority in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   The business executives were nearly unanimous in their support
for President Clinton's push to get Congress to eliminate its
annual review of China's trade privileges with the United States,
thereby giving China permanent normal trade status.
</P>
<P>
   The Business Council, composed of more than 300 current and
former chief executives of large U.S. corporations, was meeting
today and Friday at a resort in White Sulphur Springs, W.Va.

<HEADLINE> Computer Virus Hit Fed Agencies  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hiring a ''computer czar'' to coordinate the
government's high-tech crime-fighting efforts and making it a
federal crime to create a computer virus can help keep future
''Love Bugs'' from wreaking havoc, experts told a congressional
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Harris Miller, president of Information Technology Association
of America, told the House Science technology subcommittee that the
government needs to hire a point-person to send out immediate
alerts when a destructive virus is going around.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not a big office, not a lot of staff ... but someone who does
have the authority and the ear of the president in coordinating
responses across the government agencies,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   At least 14 agencies were hit by the Love Bug, including the
Social Security Administration, the Energy Department, the CIA, the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Immigration and
Naturalization Service and the Defense Department, said Keith
Rhodes, director of computer and information technology assessment
at the General Accounting Office.
</P>
<P>
   Love Bug was the fastest-spreading and most destructive computer
virus ever; it caused a flood of e-mails with the subject line
''ILOVEYOU'' to course through computer systems worldwide. When
opened, the virus destroyed graphics and other files and damaged
operating programs. Several variations appeared soon after. The
virus also installed a password-stealing program, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some DOD (Defense Department) machines required complete
software reloads to overcome the extent of the damage,'' Rhodes
said. ''The virus-slash-worm spread rapidly through the department,
penetrating even some classified systems.''
</P>
<P>
   He predicted virus attacks will continue until government
agencies suffer major damage and become more serious about
defending their computers from hackers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be worse next time and it will cost more money, but
until we bang the knee against the curb we're going to keep going
through this,'' Rhodes said.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes complained that there were too many government agencies
taking too many different security methods when the Love Bug
struck. ''A single point for getting the information out would be
valuable,'' Rhodes said. ''Right now, we've got jillions of people
trying to give information.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Tippett, chief technology officer for computer security
company ICSA.net of Reston, Va., said a quick coordinated response
is key to containing a computer virus. At least 1 million computers
had been infected by the Love Bug within five hours after it was
launched at 4 a.m. a week ago Thursday, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was half over with by 9:30 in the morning,'' Tippett said.
''That means if you learned about it at 10:30, it was too late.''
</P>
<P>
   But the federal government, Rhodes said, didn't send out its
first Love Bug alert to agencies until after 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Tippett suggested that Congress look at making it illegal to
write a computer virus. Making a bomb is illegal but writing about
how to make a bomb is not, he noted. ''But with a computer virus,
the words are the bomb,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd's of London has estimated the worldwide damage caused by
the Love Bug to be over $15 billion, said Rep. Constance Morella,
R-Md., chairwoman of the subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary survey of 63 American businesses with 200 or more
computers showed that 62 of them had been mailed a copy of the Love
Bug virus, a 98 percent rate if it holds for all major American
businesses, Tippett said.
</P>
<P>
   He said 41 of those companies were actually infected by the
virus after it was opened by an employee.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sixty-five percent of American companies, we believe, were
infected by the Love Bug on Thursday,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Moms Ready To Rally Against Guns  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- While plenty of celebrities will be there
Sunday, thousands of ordinary Americans also will spend Mother's
Day rallying on the National Mall for the licensing of gun owners
and registration of their firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainers, politicians and mothers of children who were
fatally shot plan to participate in the ''Million Mom March'' in
Washington and nearly 70 other communities. While traditional gun
control groups are involved, organizers have stressed that most
participants will be Americans who decided to get out of the house
and do something about gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''The day will be emotional and a call to action,'' said Donna
Dees-Thomases of Short Hills, N.J., a wealthy suburban mother who
conceived of the march after a white supremacist opened fire in a
Jewish Community Center in Granada Hills, Calif. last August.
</P>
<P>
   Debbye Kelley-Watson of Washington, whose 19-year-old son was
shot to death by a teen-ager three years ago, told a news
conference on the march Wednesday, ''I am turning tears into
action.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton, running for the Senate from New York, is
expected to march as a mom but does not plan to address the rally.
President Clinton is expected to participate, but the White House
has not decided what form this would take.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainers and celebrities expected to appear include Rosie
O'Donnell, Rosanne Cash, John McEnroe, Emmylou Harris, Susan
Sarandon and Melissa Etheridge.
</P>
<P>
   The primary pro-gun group, the National Rifle Association, is
not ready to concede the spotlight to images of gun control
supporters pushing their children in strollers down the Mall.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA has begun an ad campaign that portrays its members as
mainstream Americans who want to bring gun safety lessons to the
nation's classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   In television and newspaper ads running across the country this
week, the NRA dismisses policy disagreements as ''gun politics''
and says it will spend $1 million to educate children about gun
safety.
</P>
<P>
   March supporters contend that a requirement for a gun license
and registration of the weapon would not be any more burdensome
than a driver's license and vehicle registration.
</P>
<P>
   The licensing system would require purchasers to receive basic
safety training and is designed to prevent sales to criminals,
children or disturbed individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Guns would be registered after sellers checked the buyer's
license and then registered the gun's serial number.
</P>
<P>
   Among the expected speakers are Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y.,
whose husband was killed and her son injured by gun violence.
Maryland's lieutenant governor, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, daughter
of the late Robert F. Kennedy, intends to talk about losing a
parent who was the victim of a shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Participants will hear from mothers from Dunblane, Scotland,
where a gunman burst into a school in 1996 and shot students in a
kindergarten class. Mothers whose children attended Columbine High
School in Littleton, Colo., will share their stories, as will
Veronica McQueen, mother of Kayla Rolland, 6, who was fatally shot
by a classmate in Mount Morris Township, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Symbolizing the dozen children killed by gunfire every day in
the United States, 12 young people will ring a bell created by a
community-based coalition in Bridgeport, Conn. Guns given up in a
buyback program were melted down to make the clapper in the
400-pound brass bell.

<HEADLINE> Banks Given Privacy Rule Delay  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Over the objections of lawmakers and consumer
groups, federal regulators have agreed to delay by seven months the
deadline for U.S. banks and other financial companies to comply
with new rules designed to protect consumers' personal data.
</P>
<P>
   The privacy rules were supposed to take effect and become
mandatory in November. Preliminary drafts, however, elicited a
deluge of written comments from banks, investment firms, insurance
companies and other financial businesses contending it would be
difficult to meet that deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Their complaints persuaded Federal Reserve governors, including
the central bank chairman, Alan Greenspan, to vote Wednesday to
make compliance voluntary Nov. 12 and mandatory by July 1, 2001.
The six other federal agencies involved in drafting the privacy
rules also granted the delay.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers are gaining the right to request, in writing, that
their banks, securities firms and insurance companies not share
accountholders' personal data with third parties, such as
telemarketers.
</P>
<P>
   The rules also apply to a number of ''money'' businesses,
including consumer finance companies, department stores that issue
credit cards, money transmitters and money-order businesses, debt
collection agencies and credit bureaus.
</P>
<P>
   All financial companies will have to disclose their privacy
policies to customers at least once a year.
</P>
<P>
   The protections were mandated by legislation enacted last year
that removed Depression-era barriers and allowed banks, investment
firms and insurers to get into each other's businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve officials suggested that financial services
companies able to beat the new deadline for disclosing their
privacy policies to customers can use that as a marketing tool.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Ireland, the Fed's associate general counsel, said at an
open meeting of the Fed governors that banks and other financial
companies ''are going to have to use a lot of common sense'' in
following the rules. ''It's very difficult to know exactly how it's
going to play out in'' a financial company, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fed governor and vice chairman Roger Ferguson acknowledged that
regulators were giving the financial companies seeking the delay
''the benefit of the doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Their decision angered some lawmakers and consumer activists.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., who has been active in consumer
privacy issues, has gathered signatures of 30 of his colleagues on
a letter of protest to Greenspan and the heads of the other
agencies, including the Treasury Department, the Federal Trade
Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Securities
and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, 15 consumer and privacy groups, including the
Consumer Federation of America, Consumers Union, the American Civil
Liberties Union, Junkbusters and the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse,
also complained about the delay in a letter to the regulators.

<HEADLINE> Weak Euro Concerns Interest Rates  </HEADLINE>
By HANS GREIMEL, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Economists have been looking for signs
the European Central Bank might step in to halt the euro's
tailspin.
</P>
<P>
   Boosting interest rates is one weapon the ECB might use today
when its governing board meets for one of its regular twice monthly
meetings. But economists largely expect the bank to keep its main
rate unchanged because it was increased to 3.75 percent just two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have speculated, however, that the central bank could
intervene in currency markets to boost the euro by buying up the
currency and selling dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Traders made a run on the euro last week, sending it to a record
low of 88.45 cents. The dive compelled finance ministers and the
ECB to issue a rare joint statement expressing support for the
common currency, which is shared by 11 European countries.
</P>
<P>
   The ECB's main concern is that a weak euro makes imports more
expensive, fueling inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to stem that tide, the ECB raised rates a
quarter-percentage point April 27. But that rate hike had little
impact on markets, mostly because investors expected it and
factored it into their investments.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the ECB really wants its hike to have an impact, it should
use a surprise effect,'' said Deutsche Bank economist Stefan
Schneider, although he said raising rates unexpectedly today could
just as easily spook markets.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts agreed saying raising rates that soon could be
seen as a knee-jerk reaction, contrary to the ''calm and stable
monetary policy'' that ECB President Duisenberg said late last
month the central bank was pursuing.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, rumors that the central bank would buy euros and sell
dollars halted the euro's tumble and pushed it back over the 90
cent mark.
</P>
<P>
   ECB officials have refused comment on whether the bank would
intervene in currency markets, saying only that it is one option
they have at their disposal. But intervention would take the
central bank into uncharted and potentially risky territory.
</P>
<P>
   The bank would have to delve into its foreign currency reserves
to sell dollars. And if it did so but was still unable to halt the
euro's decline, it could spark a panic reaction in currency
markets. Economists say the ECB is unlikely to intervene without
coordinating with the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Japanese central
bank, neither of which has yet shown a willingness to cooperate.

<HEADLINE> White House Lobbying Hard For China  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID HO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After being repeatedly blocked from obtaining
the ''fast track'' negotiating authority needed to strike new trade
agreements, the Clinton administration has been using significant
resources to win permanent trade status for China, congressional
auditors say.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation by the General Accounting Office has found the
White House used about 150 staffers, including 100 from the
Agriculture Department, as part of the China Trade Relations
Working Group, a command center dedicated to securing congressional
approval for ''permanent normal trade relations'' status for China.
</P>
<P>
   The working group includes 10 principal members, five
presidential advisers, plus the Secretary of State, the U.S. Trade
Representative, and the Commerce, Agriculture and Treasury
secretaries, the auditors said. The remaining staff come from
various agencies and departments and work from a few hours to
full-time.
</P>
<P>
   The auditors also identified 19 trips taken between January 29
and March 1, in which the president, one of the working group
principals, or another administration representative spoke on
behalf of China trade relations. An additional 19 trips had been
planned from March 4 through April 29.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Frank R. Wolf, R-Va., a vocal critic of human rights abuses
in China who opposes permanent trade status, said he requested the
investigation after learning about the group's ''war room,'' the
command center which could influence congressional debate before a
House vote on China's trade status during the week of May 22.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf said he was concerned the White House violated a law that
prohibits the use of congressional appropriations to lobby
lawmakers. However, the statute allows executive branch officials
to request legislation ''which they deem necessary for the
efficient conduct of the public business.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Wolf dated Monday, the GAO said they haven't
completed their review and couldn't determine if any law had been
violated.
</P>
<P>
   A review of working group documents did show extensive outreach
and coordination by the administration with outside groups such as
public corporations and trade coalitions, the auditors said.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Cruise, a spokesman for the working group, said the
administration has a legitimate role in promoting its China policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are confident that our efforts have been well within the
rules for advocating administration policies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, along with the Agriculture and Commerce
departments, presented their staffing and travel information to the
GAO, but were unable to provide a total of their expenses, the GAO
said. The Treasury and Labor departments have also been involved
and are still compiling their staffing and travel information.

<HEADLINE> House Nears Passage of Land Bill  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite a vigorous debate over property
rights, the House appears to be steamrolling toward approving a $3
billion annual conservation fund for new parks, more federal and
state land purchases and restoration of coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which has broad bipartisan support and the
endorsement of the White House, was expected to pass when it comes
for a final vote today in the House. Its prospects in the Senate
are uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   In a string of votes late Wednesday, the House by solid margins
turned back amendments that would have reduced the amount of money
for new land purchases by the federal government and other
proposals aimed at providing increased protection to private
landowners.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the bill said the amendments were designed to
derail the legislation, which had been crafted during long
negotiations and represented -- as Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska
characterized it -- ''a fragile House of cards'' balancing various
political interests.
</P>
<P>
   The bill had 316 co-sponsors as it reached the House floor on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation calls for spending nearly $45 billion over 15
years on various conservation measures from creating urban parks
and to buying private inholdings surrounded by federal land.
</P>
<P>
   About a third of the money is earmarked for coastal restoration
in areas affected by offshore oil and gas drilling -- including
wetlands restoration and dealing with beach erosion. Millions of
dollars also would go for wildfire protection, endangered species
programs and creation of conservation easements to help landowners,
including ranchers, avoid having to sell to developers.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the legislation calls for spending $900
million a year -- half by the federal government and the rest by
states -- to set aside public lands. Another $125 million would be
provided to local communities for urban parks and recreational
areas and $350 million for wildlife conservation.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly $3 billion a year would come from the $4 billion to
$5 billion the government receives annually from oil leases, mainly
offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Young, chairman of the Resources Committee, called the bill
''the most comprehensive conservation and recreation legislation
the Congress has considered in decades.'' He dismissed criticism
that it threatens private land owners.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the bill unleashed a vigorous debate over property rights
with some western lawmakers arguing that it will open the way for a
rush of federal and state land purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ''What this is all about is federal acquisition of new land,''
declared Rep. Richard Pombo, R-Calif., during eight hours of debate
that lasted past midnight Wednesday. But Pombo's amendment to cut
the amount of federal money for land purchases in half, was
defeated 109-315.
</P>
<P>
   ''This bill does not hurt private property,'' insisted Young,
who along with Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., and Rep. George Miller,
D-Calif., had crafted the legislation in Young's committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't tell me it protects private property. It doesn't,''
declared Rep. Helen Chenoweth-Hage, R-Idaho, pounding the lectern.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said the aim was to make good on promises that government
made long ago to set aside wild lands for future generations and to
create more open spaces and parks.

<HEADLINE> Singer Marc Anthony Marries  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- It was a busy night for Puerto Rican pop star
Marc Anthony.
</P>
<P>
   After Tuesday night's Blockbuster Entertainment Awards in Los
Angeles, the singer and former Miss Universe Dayanara Torres hopped
on a private jet for Las Vegas, where they were married in a
midnight ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ''You could call it spur of the moment,'' Lilly Rosario, a
receptionist for Marc Anthony Productions in New York City, said
Wednesday. ''We were working here, la, la, la, and get a call,
'Marc wants to get married.' We're still tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Nieman, Anthony's publicist, said the singer secretly
had been planning the wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've been engaged seven months, and had joked about getting
married this week. Meantime, he was planning this surprise for
her,'' Nieman said.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve friends and family members attended the ceremony, Rosario
said.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony, 31, and Torres, 25, will live in Puerto Rico. It is the
first marriage for both.
</P>
<P>
   Torres, a former Miss Puerto Rico, was crowned Miss Universe in
1993. Anthony won a Grammy in 1999 for best tropical Latin
performance. He is nominated this year for best male pop vocal
performance for his single ''I Need to Know.''

<HEADLINE> Little Results in Cancer Drug Tests  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Endostatin, a cancer drug discovered by doctors at
Children's Hospital in Boston and once touted as a possible cure,
has yet to show dramatic benefits after seven months of safety
testing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not aware of any major clinical response to date,'' Dr.
James Pluda, a senior investigator at the National Cancer
Institute, said in today's Boston Globe.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, discovered by Dr. Judah Folkman and his colleagues, is
undergoing three separate trials with a starting total of 45
patients. The Cancer Institute is overseeing the tests at
Dana-Farber Partners Cancer Care in Boston, the University of
Wisconsin at Madison and in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Folkman reported in 1998 that endostatin, known as an
angiogenesis inhibitor, was one of two proteins that caused tumors
in rats to shrink or disappear by cutting off their blood supply.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Globe, there have been persistent Internet
rumors that the drug has made impressive gains against tumors in
test patients.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Globe reported, a number of the patients have
dropped out of the trials, although researchers will not say how
many.
</P>
<P>
   One of the dropouts was Chuck Killian of Chicago. Tests in
Wisconsin showed that his liver cancer had enlarged by 70 percent
while on endostatin, and under research rules, a cancer that has
grown by 50 percent or more makes the patient ineligible for the
drug.
</P>
<P>
   Killian has appealed for doctors to reinstate him in the program
on a higher dose of endostatin, but has been turned down.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I had evidence at this point that we were having a
significant clinical effect (at higher doses), and that the higher
doses were safe to give to someone who had received a substantial
amount of drug already, I'd feel bad and we would probably try to
do something,'' Pluda said. ''But I don't have any such evidence as
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Folkman said he could not help Killian, because he has no
direct control over the trials.
</P>
<P>
   The trials are being sponsored by the National Cancer Institute
in Wisconsin, the M.D. Anderson Cancer Institute in Houston and in
Boston by EntreMed Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the research trials say it is too early to make an
official report. They have said informally, according to the Globe,
that endostatin appears to have little toxicity, and has shown some
activity that suggests it is working as it is supposed to on cells
and molecules, but it does not mean it is stopping the cancer.

<HEADLINE> BET Marks Two Decades of Expansion  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- As Luther Vandross, Denzel Washington and
other stars paid homage to Black Entertainment Television at a Las
Vegas gala, the channel's founder watched with satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   Robert L. Johnson, marking the 20th anniversary of a cable TV
venture that began with a $15,000 personal loan and has turned into
a multimillion-dollar media empire, said he wasn't merely savoring
his own success.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was reflecting on the fact that BET is a connecting point
for African American creativity, the African American political
voice, African American opportunity and African American
participation in the wealth creation of the economy,'' Johnson said
after last weekend's Vegas bash.
</P>
<P>
   BET's two decades have brought accolades and expansion -- and
criticism, as well.
</P>
<P>
   The singular role played by BET and its spin-offs -- including
four other cable channels, magazine and book publishing, and
fledgling film and Internet businesses -- is undeniable. While
broadcast networks draw fire for excluding minorities, BET has
provided an outlet for black artists and, at the highest corporate
levels, for executives with ownership stakes in the company.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've created probably more African American millionaires at
BET than any other company and given opportunities for people to
manage businesses and departments they never would have gotten if
BET had not existed,'' said Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   His Washington-based company is run by the cable industry's
highest-ranking black executives, including Debra L. Lee, the
president and chief operating officer of parent company BET
Holdings Inc. Johnson is chairman and CEO of the $200
million-a-year enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   BET has spotlighted and explored black issues more fully than
its white-owned cable or broadcast counterparts. The 1995 Million
Man March in Washington received 24-hour coverage, and BET's ''Teen
Summit'' talk show has been honored by the NAACP.
</P>
<P>
   ''I cannot imagine where we would have been without BET,'' said
the Rev. Al Sharpton. ''Many like me who operate in black America
can only get our balanced story told nationally on BET talk
shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Such acclaim, however, is not universal.
</P>
<P>
   BET's risque stand-up comedy show and heavy play of sexy music
videos have been attacked by some observers as irresponsible and
unfair to viewers who would prefer more substantive or
family-oriented fare.
</P>
<P>
   One fledgling competitor, cable channel MBC, is staking its hope
for national expansion on promises of providing black-oriented
entertainment that stresses family values and avoids sleaze.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also have decried the lack of original comedy or drama
series on BET, although the channel has launched an ambitious slate
of made-for-TV movies (based on the BET-owned Arabesque line of
romance novels).
</P>
<P>
   BET's economic treatment of performers has been another
contentious area. Last fall, a full-page ad in Daily Variety
blasted BET for refusing to pay union wages to performers on the
channel's ''ComicView'' series, a rare non-union national TV
program.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, the show's success comes at the expense of its
biggest asset -- the comedians themselves,'' read the open letter
signed by Richard Pryor, Jay Leno and more than 100 other comics.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has even seeped onto newspaper comic pages. In Aaron
McGruder's strip ''The Boondocks,'' two characters debated whether
black-owned businesses act in the best interests of black
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't believe in that anymore?'' asks one. The reply:
''Let's just say BET shot a few holes in that theory.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the anniversary celebration with actor-comedian Jamie
Foxx as host was under the jurisdiction of the American Federation
of Radio and Television Artists, the union is keeping a wary eye on
future BET productions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We commend BET for 20 years of programming and their
commitment to diversity in media,'' said AFTRA spokeswoman Pamm
Fair. ''We are hopeful that we get a union agreement for
'ComicView' and other shows on BET.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is adamant about dealing with unions only when
necessary. Asked if the reported $150 fee for a ''ComicView''
appearance might be increased, his reply was guarded: ''We think
we'll be able to give comics more financial support.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the pay scale rises, Johnson is intent on
spending more on programming and brand marketing to keep the cable
channel on top among black viewers and to maximize the value of its
sister companies, such as new Internet site BET.com.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no problem spending money, investing in programming,
but it's got to be economically viable,'' he said. That rules out
TV series, he said, which cannot be profitable for a niche service
like BET because they lack syndication value.
</P>
<P>
   He won't apologize, either, for the heavy reliance on music
videos. BET boosted the careers of pop and hip-hop stars by
providing an outlet for the black videos that record companies had
been reluctant to make, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ''Music is the quintessential cultural expression for African
Americans. ... Why would BET ever not be heavily invested in this
creative experience?'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   On the public service front, Johnson said the channel will add a
weekday news report and intends significant coverage of the
Democratic and Republican conventions this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton offered a spirited defense of Johnson and BET.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes we impose on our own that which we don't impose on
others. Some who talk about BET have no problem with the
exploitation of the entertainment industry against our people,''
the activist said.
</P>
<P>
   Being the only game in town, Johnson contends, fuels attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody wants us to be a Christmas tree. They want us to put
under the tree their particular present .... We can't be a
Christmas tree. We have to be a business that decides what is in
the best interests of the business and the shareholders that we
serve.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think within those parameters, BET has done more to give
voice to African American issues than any institution that's ever
existed in this country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The anniversary celebration, which also featured Stevie Wonder,
LL Cool J, Boyz II Men and Kenneth ''Babyface'' Edmonds, will show
9 p.m. EDT Thursday, May 18, on BET.

<HEADLINE> Lee Case Fed. Prosecutor Demoted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- The federal prosecutor who directed the
high-profile investigation and prosecution of a fired Los Alamos
National Laboratory scientist has been bumped from the job.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials offered no explanation for the
removal of Assistant U.S. Attorney Bob Gorence as lead prosecutor
in the Wen Ho Lee case.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 60, faces trial Nov. 6 on 59 counts of breaching lab
security. The prosecution contends Lee transferred 19 files from
secure to unsecure computers and downloaded some material to
computer tapes. Prosecutors have called the top secret material the
''crown jewels'' of American nuclear science.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lee, who was a nuclear physicist in the weapons section
of the lab, has not been charged with espionage, prosecutors
contend he planned to forward the data to the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   Lee could get life in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Chavez, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in
Albuquerque, told The New York Times that Justice had decided to
send a prosecutor from Washington to direct the case, but Gorence
would continue to be a ''key member of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorence's replacement has not been named.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's defense attorneys applauded the move, saying it would give
their client a strategic advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is good news for Dr. Lee, as Mr. Gorence was an
experienced prosecutor,'' defense attorney Mark Holscher told the
Times.
</P>
<P>
   Until March, Gorence was the top-ranking career prosecutor in
the Albuquerque U.S. attorney's office. He took charge of the Lee
case in early April 1999.

<HEADLINE> School district considers same-sex prom dates  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MECHANICVILLE, N.Y. (AP) -- A school board will consider changing
a prom policy that bars homosexual couples.
</P>
<P>
   Board president Joseph Waldron said recent media attention has
forced the board to look at the policy that prohibits same-sex
dates, single attendees and groups of more than two. Several
district students and the New York Civil Liberties Union called the
policy discriminatory against gay and lesbian couples.
</P>
<P>
   Waldron said the policy in place for years was intended to
protect the spirit of the prom, a formal celebration different from
other school dances. Other school dances, including a formal event
earlier in the year, are open to all students.
</P>
<P>
   ''This policy has never been about discriminating against
anyone,'' Waldron told The Daily Gazette of Schenectady. ''But I
think we can change it a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Any change, however, would likely be too late for Friday's prom.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have concerns with the policy,'' said Louise Roback,
director of the local chapter of the NYCLU. ''What it says to gay
and lesbian students is 'Stay home.'''
</P>
<P>
   Waldron said the issue probably will be addressed May 18.
Waldron said he would call a special meeting before the prom if a
formal request is made by a gay or lesbian couple.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices have opened higher with the Dow
Jones Industrial Average up 48 points in today's early going.
Advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange hold a 9-to-4 lead
over decliners.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Composite Index is ahead 67 points and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 Stock Index is up 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   Weaker-than-expected economic news is giving Wall Street a boost
at the start of trading.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks are getting a bounce after a report showing retail sales
fell two-tenths of a percent in April.
</P>
<P>
   For some, it's a welcome relief after three days of selling that
left the popular averages at their lowest levels in nearly a month.
</P>
<P>
   For others, it amounts to artificial optimism.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, many analysts think the Fed will raise interest
rates next week, perhaps by as much as a half-percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   And even though today's retail sales report is generally welcome
news for those afraid of an overheating economy, it probably isn't
enough by itself to change the Fed's mind about the course of
monetary policy.

<HEADLINE> Thunderstorms batter state  </HEADLINE>
The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Violent thunderstorms stalked the state
Wednesday, whipping up winds, pelting golf ball-sized hail and
swelling creeks and rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Severe flooding in the Southern Tier put some bridges
underwater. Some 10 families in Newark Valley in Tioga County were
evacuated because of the storms. The Red Cross set up a shelter at
Newark Valley High School, and more than 20 roads were closed due
to the flooding. The school west of Binghamton is closed today
after as many as three dozen Tioga County roads were closed at one
point Wednesday because of flooding.
</P>
<P>
   High water washed out two bridges -- one in Newark Valley, the
other in nearby Owego. Several secondary roads in Tioga County also
were damaged. Earlier in the day, roadway flooding occurred in
several communities in Broome County.
</P>
<P>
   The storms also caused minor damage to a few buildings in the
Southern Tier. A large chunk of concrete fell from one downtown
Binghamton building, narrowly missing pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
   In the Albany suburb of Colonie, two people were struck by
lightning, with one of them hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   It was a day Rome car dealer Wayne Vogt said he'd sooner forget.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically, the storm came and was in and out in about 10
minutes,'' Vogt said. ''But it came with a vengeance. It got every
vehicle on the lot -- new, used. I've got about 100 new and probably
150 used vehicles, and there's damage on them all.''
</P>
<P>
   Vogt said the damage was fixable, but the cars will never quite
look the same.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Lyman, spokesman for the Niagara Mohawk utility company,
said that fallen trees and lightning bolts had caused scattered
power outages in Saratoga County and other areas of eastern New
York. The outages, except for perhaps some isolated cases, were
corrected by today, Lyman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're working on them all,'' Lyman said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in Cortland and Tompkins counties reported flash
flooding and downed trees and utility poles but no major problems.
Two-inch hail was seen in Chenango County with smaller hail spotted
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Madison County officials reported hail one-inch in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   The southern part of the state received about one-and-a-half
inches of rain.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rain and hail came down in a burst, caused some flooding,
and then it was over,'' said Michelle Egburtson, a dispatcher with
the Penn Yan Police Department in Yates County. Emergency
management officials there measured hail of up to 1} inches.
</P>
<P>
   Early Wednesday afternoon, the National Weather Service advised
conditions that could spawn a tornado near Ithaca, but the twisters
never developed.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were a bunch of individual storm cells,'' said Mike
Cempa, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Albany.
''It was somewhat of an unusual event.''
</P>
<P>
   Cempa said two fronts collided in the southern part of the state
and sent the strong weather systems northward.
</P>
<P>
   Rain and thunderstorms were expected to continue throughout the
night.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday will bring mostly cloudy skies and the chance of
showers and highs in the 60s, Cempa said.

<HEADLINE> LeAnn Rimes Sues Father, Ex-Manager  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- LeAnn Rimes says her father and her former
co-manager took more than $7 million from her over five years.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-age country crooner, in a lawsuit filed May 2 in Dallas
County District Court, claims Wilbur C. Rimes and Lyle Walker
funneled money away from her personally and from the company set up
in 1995 to manage her finances.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit asks for unspecified damages because attorneys don't
know how much money is gone, attorney Tom Rhodus told The Dallas
Morning News in a story published today.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would appear that her father didn't always act in a
fatherly way to her,'' Rhodus said Wednesday. He is representing
Rimes, 17, and her mother, Belinda Rimes.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Rhorer, a Baton Rouge, La.-based attorney representing the
singer's father, called the accusations ''completely false'' and
said his client's ''compensation was fair.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I can imagine no heartbreak greater than that of a father
watching helplessly as others, for their own personal gain,
alienate the affections of his daughter,'' Rhorer said.
</P>
<P>
   Walker's lawyer said the singer's company owes the ex-manager
money.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lyle Walker is the one who has been wronged here,'' Keith
Trent said. ''This effort will not be successful.''
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Stocks Open Higher in New York  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved higher in early trading today as a
report of lower retail sales calmed investors who have been selling
stocks amid fears about rising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 69.22 at 10,437.00.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. the Nasdaq composite
index was up 22.47 at 3,407.20, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was up 9.65 at 1,392.70.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks rose after the Commerce Department said retail sales fell
by a surprising 0.2 percent. Analysts had expected a gain of 0.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were quick to cite bad weather in April that kept many
Americans out of the stores. But the decline raised some hopes that
the Federal Reserve's series of interest rate increases is
succeeding in slowing consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed is widely expected to raise interest rates again at its
May 16 meeting. Economists are divided on whether central bankers
will stick to their strategy of boosting rates by a
quarter-percentage point at a time, or whether they will opt for a
half-percentage point increase this time.
</P>
<P>
   Rate-sensitive stocks rose after the retail sales report was
released. J.P. Morgan rose 2 15/16 to 125 9/16..
</P>
<P>
   But recent weakness in the technology sector prevailed. Applied
Materials fell 4| to 80. After the close of trading Wednesday, the
company reported operating earnings of 55 cents a share, in line
with analysts' estimates. Investors had hoped for the company, a
leading maker of equipment used in the semiconductor industry, to
exceed estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 123.64 million
shares, ahead of Wednesday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 4.15 to 478.43.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. stocks overcame a steep selloff in Japan. The Nikkei stock
average plunged 4.63 percent to its lowest close in 7{ months, with
technology, telecommunications and financial-services stocks
leading the way down. Traders blamed the weakness on Wall Street's
decline on Wednesday, when the Dow fell 168 points and the Nasdaq
plunged 200 points.
</P>
<P>
   European markets were unscathed by the heavy selling in Japan.
Germany's Xetra DAX index was up 0.8 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100
was up 2.2 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 0.9 percent.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani announces he and wife are moving toward legal separation  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the stern figure who
prides himself on having brought righteousness back to Sin City,
finds himself in the uncharacteristic role of seeing his private
life threatening his public career.
</P>
<P>
   Now -- with Giuliani and his wife, Donna Hanover, discussing a
separation -- people are questioning whether his U.S. Senate bid can
continue.
</P>
<P>
   ''I spoke to the mayor at 10 a.m. and he said that he had still
not made a decision'' about whether he's staying in the race,
campaign spokesman Bruce Teitelbaum said today.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Republican official close to Giuliani, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said he mayor was leaning toward quitting
the race. ''His heart, his soul, his body are not in this thing,''
said the official, who also said Giuliani hadn't made a final
decision. Republicans in Washington and New York are already
talking about who might run against the first lady if Giuliani
drops out.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor told a Wednesday news conference, ''I don't really
care about politics right now. I'm thinking about my family, the
people that I love and what can be done that's honest and truthful
and that protects them the best. ... Politics comes at least
second, maybe third, maybe fourth, somewhere else at least.''
</P>
<P>
   He called things ''very, very painful'' and said of his
marriage, ''For quite some time, it's probably been apparent that
Donna and I lead, in most ways, independent and separate lives.
It's been a very painful road and I hope we'll be able to formalize
that in an agreement that protects our children, that gives them
all the security and protection that they deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time Giuliani, 55, has confirmed that his
marriage with Hanover, 50, a television personality and actress, is
strained. The couple have two children, Andrew, 14, and Caroline,
10.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure caps a bizarre two-week period for the mayor, who
guards his privacy zealously but has recently been forced to make a
series of public announcements about exceedingly personal matters.
</P>
<P>
   First, on April 27, Giuliani announced he had been diagnosed
with treatable prostate cancer and said it could affect his Senate
run. Then, on May 3, he acknowledged that Judith Nathan, a
45-year-old divorcee with whom he has been seen around town, was a
''very good friend'' but refused to further characterize the
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Republican mayor, who is running against first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, said his disclosure had nothing to do
with politics.
</P>
<P>
   Later Wednesday, Giuliani aides said the campaign is ''all
systems go.''
</P>
<P>
   However, political experts said that the talk of separation --
combined with his prostate cancer -- cannot help but affect the
campaign. Democratic political consultant George Arzt said it
raised questions about Giuliani's determination to run and might
hurt him among socially conservative groups like Catholics and
Orthodox Jews.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the Giuliani-Hanover marriage on The Today
Show, Clinton replied, ''Out of respect for them, we should just
leave them alone and do what is best for them.''
</P>
<P>
   After Giuliani's comments, Hanover summoned reporters to Gracie
Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today's turn of events brings me great sadness,'' she said,
her eyes welling with tears. ''I had hoped that we could keep this
marriage together. For several years, it was difficult to
participate in Rudy's public life because of his relationship with
one staff member.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ''Beginning last May, I made a major effort to bring
us back together. Rudy and I re-established some of our personal
intimacy through the fall. At that point he chose another path.
Rudy and I will now discuss the possibility of a legal
separation.''
</P>
<P>
   Joannie Danielides, Hanover's press secretary, said the staff
member her boss was referring to was Cristyne Lategano-Nicholas,
Giuliani's former communications director.
</P>
<P>
   Lategano-Nicholas, 35, has since left City Hall and now heads
the city's tourism bureau.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has denied having a romantic relationship with
Lategano-Nicholas, and Lategano-Nicholas said Wednesday, ''I have
no desire to speculate why Donna Hanover decided to issue the
statement that she did.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and Hanover have not appeared in public together in
years, although the mayor has been seen at both public and private
functions with Nathan in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's press conference, the mayor said he had
''tremendous respect'' for his wife. He went on to describe Nathan
as ''a very, very kind person.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I rely on her and she's helped me a great deal. And I'm going
to need her more now than maybe I did before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan, a registered nurse, emerged from her Manhattan apartment
briefly Wednesday only to ask for privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani -- who usually keeps his emotions to himself and told
reporters ''I feel terrible'' and that he was ''very sad'' --
revealed a side that he has never shown before publicly.
</P>
<P>
   He said neither he nor his wife plan on moving out of Gracie
Mansion, the mayor's residence, for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   ''A separation agreement is not a divorce,'' he said.

   ''It appears that the volatile stock market and higher interest

senior economist at Merrill Lynch. ''However, this one-month
slowdown should not derail the Fed.''

<HEADLINE> Canada Board Criticizes Dr. Laura  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- A Canadian regulatory group has chided radio talk
show host Dr. Laura Schlessinger for ''abusively discriminatory''
comments about gays and lesbians on her show.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian Broadcast Standards Council said Schlessinger,
known as Dr. Laura, violated the human rights provision of the
Canadian Association of Broadcasters' code of ethics.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, announced Wednesday, means Canadian networks that
broadcast the syndicated show must make a public announcement about
the council ruling during prime-time hours. Her program is believed
to reach almost 1 million Canadians. There is no further penalty on
the show.
</P>
<P>
   Schlessinger has about 15 million listeners weekly on more than
400 stations in the United States. She also writes a column that
appears in more than 100 newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Known for her socially conservative opinions and combative
style, she offers advice to listeners on relationships and other
matters. Gay rights groups have protested the program in the United
States, including a rally in March outside the Paramount Pictures
lot in Los Angeles against the studio's plans for a television talk
show hosted by Schlessinger.
</P>
<P>
   Schlessinger has said she doesn't hate gays, but that homosexual
activity runs counter to her religious beliefs. She was not
immediately available for reaction to the board ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian council cited Dr. Laura for characterizing the
sexual behavior of gays and lesbians as ''abnormal,'' ''aberrant,''
''deviant,'' ''disordered,'' ''dysfunctional'' and ''an error.''
</P>
<P>
   ''To use such brutal language as she does about such an
essential characteristic flies in the face of Canadian provisions
relating to human rights,'' the council decision said.
</P>
<P>
   The council also ruled Schlessinger's generalizations that
pedophilia was more prevalent among members of the gay community
than the heterosexual community were abusively discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
   It noted Schlessinger lacked a medical degree to practice
psychiatry or psychology, and said her views ''were more than a
quarter of a century out of date in the opinion of the professional
psychiatric and psychological associations.''
</P>
<P>
   The council is an independent, not-for-profit organization
established by the Canadian Association of Broadcasters. It
previously has cited radio star Howard Stern for inappropriate
comments.
</P>
<P>
   ''In Canada, we respect freedom of speech but do not worship
it,'' the council ruling stated.

<HEADLINE> Scott Smith sentenced to 6 years in prison  </HEADLINE>
By STRAT DOUTHAT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITCHFIELD, Conn. (AP) -- Former New Milford police Officer Scott
Smith was sentenced today to six years in prison for the fatal
shooting of a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, the first Connecticut officer charged with murder for an
act in the line of duty, faced 5 to 40 years in prison after he was
convicted of intentional manslaughter in the December 1998 death of
Franklyn Reid.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was white; Reid was black.
</P>
<P>
   The sentencing came four days after Judge Charles D. Gill
rejected Smith's request for a new trial. Defense lawyers had
argued that juror misconduct tainted the trial. The judge said he
found little evidence that would support that.
</P>
<P>
   A group of black activists and more than 20 nonuniformed
officers sat in the packed courtroom as Smith said he ''sincerely
believed (Reid) was trying to gain access to a weapon. I shot
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Smith told the court in quiet tones how he had gone to
work that day and felt he was doing his duty as he assisted a
fellow officer in pursuing Reid, who was wanted on several
outstanding warrants including harassment and failure to appear in
court.
</P>
<P>
   Before handing down the sentence, Gill spoke of the difficulties
police officers face every day on the job. But he said a crime had
been committed and the law had to be upheld.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the sentence was fair,'' said Pearlylyn Reid, the
victim's mother. ''We had faith in Judge Gill from day one.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney John J. Kelly immediately asked that Smith be
freed on bond pending appeal, and Gill granted the request. Smith
posted the $250,000 bond soon after the sentencing and left the
courthouse, flanked by his attorney and New Milford police
officers.
</P>
<P>
   He paused to wave to a group of about a half-dozen people who
sang hymns and held signs that read ''Support Scott Smith.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I appreciate all the support,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said he was grateful the judge handed down the minimum
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 28, who was fired after his conviction, said he shot Reid
after a foot chase because he believed Reid was reaching for a
weapon.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the shooting, Reid, 27, was unarmed. A short
folding knife was discovered in the pocket of a jacket found a few
feet away from his body.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, witnesses reported seeing Smith chase Reid.
One witness said he saw Smith draw his gun and saw Reid sitting
down. Another testified that Smith's foot was on Reid's back just
before the shooting. Prosecutors said evidence from Reid's clothes
and autopsy backed up this version of events and contradicted
Smith's claim that Reid was on his knees and possibly reaching for
a weapon when he fired.
</P>
<P>
   ''This community has viewed the shooting as morally and legally
improper,'' said Waterbury State's Attorney John Connelly, who
prosecuted the case. ''Justice was served.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense filed a motion for a new trial three weeks after
Smith was convicted. Kelly cited nine instances of possible
misconduct, including allegations that one juror flashed a badge
and claimed special knowledge of police procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Gill met last week with all 12 jurors, questioning them about
some of the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The court, after listening and observing all 12 jurors on the
subject, finds that there is absolutely no basis for this claim of
misconduct,'' Gill ruled Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Within the past two months, the town of 24,000 has seen two of
its police officers convicted in charges relating to separate
civilian deaths. A month after Smith's conviction, William
Scribner, a 14-year veteran of the police force, was found guilty
of negligent homicide stemming from the June 1998 death of
17-year-old girl whose car was struck by his speeding cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   Former New Milford Police Chief James Sweeney retired last
summer to take a job with a private school. He said his departure
had nothing to do with the department turmoil.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Mostly Higher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly higher today as a report of a
slowdown in retail sales calmed investors who have been selling
stocks amid fears about rising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 160.12 at 10,527.90.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Nasdaq composite
index was up 94.69 at 3,479.42, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was up 21.60 at 1,404.65.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks rose after the Commerce Department said retail sales fell
0.2 percent. Economists had expected a increase of 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were quick to cite bad weather in April that kept many
Americans out of the stores. But the decline raised some hopes that
the Federal Reserve's series of interest rate increases is
succeeding in slowing consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed is widely expected to raise interest rates again at its
May 16 meeting. Economists are divided on whether central bankers
will stick to their strategy of boosting rates by a
quarter-percentage point at a time, or whether they will opt for a
half-percentage point increase this time.
</P>
<P>
   The retail sales report alone won't dissuade the Fed from the
harsher, half-point increase, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appears that the volatile stock market and higher interest
rates have started to slow consumer spending,'' said Stan Shipley,
senior economist at Merrill Lynch. ''However, this one-month
slowdown should not derail the Fed.''
</P>
<P>
   Rate-sensitive stocks rose after the retail sales report was
released. J.P. Morgan rose 4] to 126, and American Express rose 1
5/16 to 49 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, which fell sharply on Wednesday, rebounded 5 15/16 to
112, contributing to the Dow's advance.
</P>
<P>
   But some skittishness in the technology sector prevailed.
Applied Materials recovered from a steep early drop and was up ~ to
85{. After the close of trading Wednesday, the company reported
operating earnings of 55 cents a share, in line with analysts'
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said Applied Materials failed to get a bounce from the
strong earnings report because many investors were hoping for the
company, a leading maker of equipment used in the semiconductor
industry, to exceed estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 437.03 million
shares, ahead of Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 10.49 to
484.77.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. stocks overcame a sharp selloff in Japan. The Nikkei stock
average plunged 4.63 percent to its lowest close in 7{ months, with
technology, telecommunications and financial-services stocks
leading the way down. Traders blamed the weakness on Wall Street's
decline on Wednesday, when the Dow fell 168 points and the Nasdaq
plunged 200 points.

<HEADLINE> General's Harass Claim Supported  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Army investigators have substantiated a charge
by the service's highest-ranngki wom tanhat shwae s touched in a
sexual way by another general in her Pentagon office, senior
defense officials said today.
</P>
<P>
   The finding, in support of an allegation by Lt. Gen. Claudia J.
Kennedy against Army Maj. Gen. Larry G. Smith, will be reviewed by
the Army's vice chief of staff, Gen. John Keane, who will determine
whether to take disciplinary action against Smith. Keane also could
ask the investigators to look further into the incident, which
happened in 1996, and resubmit their report, officials familiar
with the case said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials discussed the matter on condition of anonymity.
The Army has refused to comment publicly on the matter -- even to
confirm Kennedy made an allegation -- since it came to light in
March.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Army will not comment on stories which speculate about
administrative investigations,'' Maj. Gen. John G. Meyer, the
Army's chief of public information, said today. ''Inspector-general
investigative procedures are designed to encourage candor and
protect the individual privacy of all parties.''
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post reported today that Smith probably will
receive a reprimand and be forced to retire if, as expected, the
Army inspector general's findings are accepted by Keane. Smith will
be provided a copy of the findings and be given time to offer
contrary evidence, officials said today.
</P>
<P>
   Similar stories were reported in The New York Times and the Los
Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter's phone call today to the office of Smith's military
lawyer, Army Lt. Col. Robert Teetsel, was not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., said she hopes the Army moves
swiftly to conclude the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''This case deserves more than day-by-day information leaks from
bashful sources,'' she said. ''General Kennedy is due to retire in
just a few weeks, and it is my hope that attention will shift to
celebrating her outstanding 30-plus-year career of patriotic and
honorable military service.''
</P>
<P>
   The exact behavior of which Smith is accused has not been made
clear. The Post reported that the inspector general found that
Smith tried to kiss Kennedy, and that Army officials do not view
this as actionable under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who is married, was announced last August as the next
deputy inspector general of the Army, a position in which he would
be responsible for overseeing investigations of the kind of
behavior he is accused of. His status had been on official ''hold''
since last November, and he is assigned to the Army's Materiel
Command in Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy reportedly went to the Army inspector general with her
complaint about Smith after the August announcement that he was
being promoted to the deputy inspector general's post. The Post
reported today that Kennedy had hoped to save the Army
embarrassment by pursuing the matter discreetly.
</P>
<P>
   Since the case became public in March, neither Kennedy nor Smith
has been willing to discuss it publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Army officials said today that Kennedy had no comment on news
reports of the inspector general's findings.
</P>
<P>
   The Post said investigators found that while Kennedy did not
make a formal complaint of sexual harassment at the time of the
incident, she described it to friends and colleagues soon after it
occurred. Investigators found the supporting accounts by Kennedy's
friends and colleagues to be persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, the Army's deputy chief of staff for intelligence, is
due to retire in June. She is the Army's highest-ranking woman and
one of only three female three-star generals in the military. In
1997 she served on a special task force that examined sexual
harassment in the Army and concluded that it existed ''throughout
the Army, crossing gender, rank and racial lines.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy case is the latest in a string of embarrassing
sexual misconduct cases in the Army. Coincidentally, one earlier
case involved another two-star general from the inspector general's
office. Maj. Gen. David ale ede poonputyspgenerafo four nt19ore heaswed toetteg

<HEADLINE> Clinton Chides Tech Biz Over Pay Gap  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even in the high-flying, highly paid world of
high technology, women earn less than men, President Clinton said
today.
</P>
<P>
   ''The gap is still far, far too wide'' in high-tech and other
fields, ''and women and their families are paying a terrible
price,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, women earn about 75 percent as much as equally
qualified men, according to a variety of government and independent
studies. The results are about the same for the information
technology, or IT, industry, even though the industry has
experienced a dramatic growth in jobs and wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fewer than one in three of these high-tech, high-wage jobs are
women,'' Clinton said at a White House commemoration of ''Equal Pay
Day,'' the theoretical point in the year when women and better-paid
men begin earning equal pay for equal work.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called the disparity ''another digital divide,'' the
term he uses to describe the shortage of computer skills and access
in poor and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   He was joined by Karen Simmons-Beathea, who was fired by a
Baltimore cable television station after complaining about her
salary. Her male replacement, whom she considers less qualified,
was offered a salary some 20 percent higher, according to an Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ''I grieved the loss and I called the EEOC,'' she said, to
laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Information technology work, which includes computer
programming, design and engineering, is growing at a furious pace.
Since 1983, employment in the industry grew 81 percent, according
to the White House report, while job growth in the general economy
was 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Women benefit from the overall affluence of the industry --
making salaries nearly 50 percent above women in the wider work
force, the White House report found.
</P>
<P>
   ''However, an important gender employment gap exists in the IT
occupations,'' said the report from the White House Council of
Economic Advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Women make up only 29 percent of the five basic information
technology job categories studied in the report, although they are
47 percent of the work force at large, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Further, women are scarcest in the high-tech jobs that pay the
most, the report found. For example, only 10 percent of electrical
engineers are women, the report found.
</P>
<P>
   While 20 percent of male high-tech workers earn $69,740 or more,
only 7 percent of female workers earn that much, the report found.
</P>
<P>
   None of that is very surprising to Jason Mahler, vice president
and general counsel for the Computer and Communications Industry
Association, a Washington trade group.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's difficult to argue that there isn't some truth to it,''
Mahler said. ''Anyone who knows anything about the tech industry
can just anecdotally tell that there's a lower number of women.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mahler said much of the problem begins in schools, long
before women vie for high-tech jobs. Too few women seek education
in fields that will prepare them for the best-paying jobs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is something we for a long time have tried to address.
... We haven't fully succeeded,'' Mahler said.

<HEADLINE> Bridgeport, Conn., bishop named to succeed O'Connor in New York  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Bishop Edward M. Egan said today that the spirit
of the late Cardinal O'Connor will be with him when he takes the
helm of the nation's most visible Roman Catholic archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   ''The archdiocese of New York is an extraordinary community of
faith. To be invited to serve this splendid archdiocese as its
shepherd is quite humbling,'' the 68-year-old bishop of Bridgeport,
Conn., said at a news conference. ''The responsibility has,
however, been accepted with great joy.''
</P>
<P>
   The appointment, which comes a week after O'Connor's death from
brain cancer, was announced this morning at the Vatican by Pope
John Paul II. It will be formalized at a June 19 ceremony at St.
Patrick's Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   Facing reporters in a simple black priest's suit with a white
clerical collar, Egan first praised his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   After a brain operation last September, O'Connor ''suffered a
great deal, and showed us all how to live with physical weakness.
... He was an inspiration to a countless number of people, and we
are grateful for his leadership and his courage.''
</P>
<P>
   The bishop said he remembered his time working with the cardinal
in New York in the 1980s, and said of his new responsibilities, ''I
think the cardinal will be on my side.''
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on how he feels about moving from a relatively small
diocese to New York, he said: ''My first reaction was, 'Edward, get
down on your knees and beg the Lord to give you a hand, and don't
get up too quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   His second reaction: ''Edward, get up off your knees.''
</P>
<P>
   Tall and stately, with a stentorian voice, the bishop is a fine
speaker who follows a cardinal known for his eloquence and humor.
</P>
<P>
   With Egan, the Vatican has put a staunch conservative in the
Roman Catholic Church's most prominent position in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   As head of the Connecticut diocese since 1988, he is known for
backing the pope's condemnation of abortion, homosexual acts and
contraception. He has also raised controversy in his diocese for
his defense of the church in the face of a sexual molestation suit
against local priests.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the post as spiritual leader of New York's 2.4 million
Catholics, Egan is widely expected to be elevated to cardinal the
next time the pope selects new ''princes'' of the church.
</P>
<P>
   He handled the media in a personable but authoritative manner,
telling about 100 reporters, ''I look forward to having great fun
with you in this wonderful diocese,'' and noting jokingly: ''I
don't feel like the boss, but give me a little time and I will.''
</P>
<P>
   Egan said his first action will be to meet with the priests in
his new archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe that the number one attraction ... is a happy group
of priests and a happy group of religious,'' meaning nuns, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Answering some questions in Italian and Spanish, the
archbishop-designate demonstrated that he'll quickly be in touch
with two ethnic groups that comprise more than half the
archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   But he also showed the kind of toughness expected in a city Pope
John Paul II has called ''the capital of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the problem of teen-age pregnancy, Egan became a bit
testy, telling a reporter: ''I didn't hear you and your question is
out of context.''
</P>
<P>
   And like O'Connor, he was not at a loss for words when politics
popped up.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he would take advice from Hillary Rodham Clinton,
a Chicago-area native like the bishop, he said, ''Perhaps Mrs.
Clinton could give me some advice about being a New Yorker.''
</P>
<P>
   An expert on canon law, Egan is well known at the Holy See after
years of work at the Vatican. In his dozen years in Bridgeport, he
won a reputation as a tireless recruiter of new priests and a deft
fund-raiser in a diocese that includes Fairfield County, one of the
richest in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, he faces an archdiocese strapped for funds and
struggling to keep its schools and institutions solvent.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment brings him back to a city where he was appointed
in 1985 by O'Connor, at the pope's request, to be auxiliary bishop
and vicar for education.
</P>
<P>
   Egan was born in 1932 in the Chicago suburb of Oak Park,
birthplace of Ernest Hemingway, and ordained a priest for the
Chicago archdiocese in 1957. He studied theology at Rome's
prestigious Gregorian Pontifical University, where he went on to
obtain a doctorate in canon law.
</P>
<P>
   He earned a bachelor's degree in philosophy from St. Mary of the
Lake Seminary in Mundelein, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Egan served from 1972 to 1985 on the Vatican tribunal that
decides important juridical matters, including whether to grant
annulments. Once elevated to cardinal, Egan would vote in a
conclave for a new pope following the death of a pontiff.

<HEADLINE> Black: U.S. Sales Completing in July  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Conrad Black, chairman of Hollinger
International, said he expects the sale his company's community
newspapers to be completed within 10 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at his company's annual shareholder meeting in New York
Thursday, Black said the company has received a ''great many''
expressions of interest from potential buyers for the properties.
</P>
<P>
   ''The responses have been encouraging so far,'' Black said. He
declined to identify exactly which newspapers would be put on the
block.
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto-based Hollinger, which controls 60 percent of
Canada's daily newspapers, announced two weeks ago that it would
put up for sale about 300 daily and weekly newspapers in Canada and
50 in the United States, all with less than 50,000 circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Black said that about 60 percent of the proceeds from the sale
would be used to pay down debt and the rest to buy back the
company's stock. Hollinger has retained Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
to coordinate the sales.
</P>
<P>
   Black also said he has seen no downward pressure on the
circulation of the company's newspapers because of the Internet. He
declined to disclose details of the company's Internet operations,
but said Hollinger's investments so far have totaled $65 million in
venture stakes and about $23 million to $25 million in
Internet-related operations in its own newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Hollinger publishes Canada's National Post, the Jerusalem Post,
and the Chicago Sun-Times.

<HEADLINE> Delphi Shareholders Rebuff Board  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOKOMO, Ind. (AP) -- Shareholders of Delphi Automotive Systems
Corp. rebuffed the board's recommendation and voted to eliminate a
corporate provision to discourage hostile takeovers.
</P>
<P>
   The nonbinding vote came at the first annual meeting on
Wednesday since the auto parts company was separated from parent
General Motors Corp. a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the vote, 213 million shares were voted to eliminate the
poison pill while 140 million were cast against a repeal.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman J.T. Battenberg III said Delphi directors will review
the issue and consider the available options, but said the board is
not compelled to repeal the poison pill.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the favorable vote represented a minority -- 38
percent -- of the company's total 563 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   The board had recommended keeping the poison pill policy, which
triggers a variety of defenses whenever a single shareholder
acquires 15 percent or more of the outstanding stock.
</P>
<P>
   The ''poison-pill'' defense was adopted in 1998 when Delphi
still was part of GM.
</P>
<P>
   The shareholder who submitted the proposal to end the policy,
John Chevedden of Redondo Beach, Calif., argued it did not give
shareholders a voice in such situations.
</P>
<P>
   He said stockholders ought to have the opportunity to vote on a
new policy and argued the plan currently in place gives Delphi's
directors absolute power to veto any proposed business combination,
even one regarded as beneficial to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   The Troy, Mich.-based Delphi employs about 201,000 workers in 37
countries.

positions.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Massive Party Held at Cannes  </HEADLINE>
By JOCELYN NOVECK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANNES, France (AP) -- As the sun rose over Cannes on Thursday
morning, the big business news was that Miramax had bought the U.S.
rights to ''Vatel,'' a lavish period piece set in the court of
Louis XIV. But that's not what anyone was talking about.
</P>
<P>
   They were talking about the film's opening-night party.
</P>
<P>
   There are parties and there are parties, and they happen every
night at this festival on the Riviera. So it's easy to get a bit
blase. But this one, it's safe to say, will remain on the lips of
Cannes-goers for a while to come.
</P>
<P>
   Some lips, though, were sealed -- namely those of Gaumont, the
French company that financed the film, when asked the party's price
tag. ''No, we'll never reveal that,'' said a spokeswoman -- who then
asked that her name not be used.
</P>
<P>
   Director Roland Joffe was only a bit more forthcoming, saying
the party did indeed cost less -- ''a little less'' -- than the $35
million it took to make the film.
</P>
<P>
   ''Vatel,'' starring Uma Thurman and Gerard Depardieu, is based
on the tragic, true story of Francois Vatel, a steward to a French
prince who's called upon to prepare an elaborate, three-day feast
for the visiting Louis XIV and his entire Versailles court.
</P>
<P>
   Vatel, played by Depardieu, is loyal to his aging boss, who
desperately needs to gain the king's favor, organizing the most
dazzling festivities in his power, with scarce resources. The food
is exquisite, as is the entertainment: exotic dancers, singers on
floats suspended in the air, sudden bursts of fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   The film's strength is its faithful recreation of these events.
The party's strength was its faithful recreation of the film.
</P>
<P>
   For one evening, the multistory festival palace was transformed
into the prince's Chateau de Chantilly. As 700 guests -- among them
Thurman and Depardieu, Jeremy Irons, Andie MacDowell, Kristin Scott
Thomas and Jennifer Jason Leigh -- entered, they were greeted by
nearly 100 actors in period costume, going about the business of
throwing a huge party.
</P>
<P>
   Young noblemen tipped their wide-brimmed hats to the ladies. A
young girl sang softly, accompanied by a harpist. Inside,
maidservants in headscarves folded laundry. Pheasants and roosters
hung from hooks. Gargantuan fish waited to be cleaned and cooked.
Rows of onions and potatoes stood by the chopping block.
</P>
<P>
   Recreating the glorious ice sculptures in the film, a real-life
ice sculptor carved into the evening. A pastry chef turned out
concoctions, offering guests a taste.
</P>
<P>
   In the dining room, menu cards in 17th-century writing announced
the feast: charlotte of lobster, sea bass with fennel, a raspberry
dessert (with Chantilly cream, of course). On a lighted stage
behind a screen sat the royal party: actors dressed as the king and
queen, entertained all night by dancers and musicians.
</P>
<P>
   And then the finale. Just as in the film, where bursts of
fireworks come out of nowhere, delighting the king and his court,
flames of white erupted about the room. And when the crowd thought
it was over, the flower pots on each table suddenly erupted,
showering cascades of sparkles. (One shuddered to think of the fire
hazard, but it worked as planned.)
</P>
<P>
   Film companies regularly throw parties to fete their films at
Cannes, and Gaumont's party for ''The Fifth Element'' in 1997 was
also huge and expensive. But many Cannes-goers said the ''Vatel''
party was the most memorable in years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the real Vatel would have been proud,'' Joffe said.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani says he hasn't yet decided about Senate race  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani insisted today that he
has not made a final decision yet about the Senate race as he
fought back speculation that cancer and marital problems have put
him on the verge of dropping out.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't made up my mind if I have the energy and the
capacity to run,'' he said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   He angrily dismissed what he called ''false rumors'' and
statements from anonymous sources that he was about to abandon his
bid for the Senate against first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't discuss that with anyone,'' he said. ''I didn't even
think about it yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he still wants to be senator if his health allows it,
he said: ''I very much would like the opportunity to carry on my
public service, yes. ... Rumors of my demise are greatly
exaggerated.''
</P>
<P>
   The introspective side that the mayor has revealed lately as he
disclosed that he has prostate cancer and is seeking a separation
from his wife gave way to a more familiar, prickly side at this
event.
</P>
<P>
   ''Shhhh!'' he scolded as journalists shouted and jockeyed to get
their questions heard. ''Do you realize you embarrass yourself
doing this?''
</P>
<P>
   At another point, asked about the philandering alleged by his
wife, he told a reporter, ''Get lost! Get lost!''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier today, a senior Republican official close to Giuliani,
speaking on condition of anonymity, told The Associated Press that
the mayor was leaning toward quitting the race. ''His heart, his
soul, his body are not in this thing,'' said the official, who also
said Giuliani hadn't made a final decision. Republicans in
Washington and New York are already talking about who might run
against the first lady if Giuliani drops out.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Giuliani said: ''I don't really care about
politics right now. I'm thinking about my family, the people that I
love and what can be done that's honest and truthful and that
protects them the best. ... Politics comes at least second, maybe
third, maybe fourth, somewhere else at least.''
</P>
<P>
   He called things ''very, very painful'' and said of his
marriage, ''For quite some time, it's probably been apparent that
Donna and I lead, in most ways, independent and separate lives.
It's been a very painful road and I hope we'll be able to formalize
that in an agreement that protects our children, that gives them
all the security and protection that they deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time Giuliani, 55, had confirmed that his
marriage with Hanover, 50, a television personality and actress, is
strained. The couple have two children, Andrew, 14, and Caroline,
10.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure caps a bizarre two-week period for the mayor, who
guards his privacy zealously but has recently been forced to make a
series of public announcements about exceedingly personal matters.
</P>
<P>
   First, on April 27, Giuliani announced he had been diagnosed
with treatable prostate cancer and said it could affect his Senate
run. Then, on May 3, he acknowledged that Judith Nathan, a
45-year-old divorcee with whom he has been seen around town, was a
''very good friend'' but refused to further characterize the
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Republican mayor, who is running against first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, said his disclosure had nothing to do
with politics.
</P>
<P>
   Later Wednesday, Giuliani aides said the campaign is ''all
systems go.''
</P>
<P>
   However, political experts said that the talk of separation --
combined with his prostate cancer -- cannot help but affect the
campaign. Democratic political consultant George Arzt said it
raised questions about Giuliani's determination to run and might
hurt him among socially conservative groups like Catholics and
Orthodox Jews.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the Giuliani-Hanover marriage on the ''Today''
show, Clinton replied, ''Out of respect for them, we should just
leave them alone and do what is best for them.''
</P>
<P>
   After Giuliani's comments Wednesday, Hanover summoned reporters
to Gracie Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today's turn of events brings me great sadness,'' she said,
her eyes welling with tears. ''I had hoped that we could keep this
marriage together. For several years, it was difficult to
participate in Rudy's public life because of his relationship with
one staff member.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ''Beginning last May, I made a major effort to bring
us back together. Rudy and I re-established some of our personal
intimacy through the fall. At that point he chose another path.
Rudy and I will now discuss the possibility of a legal
separation.''
</P>
<P>
   Joannie Danielides, Hanover's press secretary, said the staff
member her boss was referring to was Cristyne Lategano-Nicholas,
Giuliani's former communications director.
</P>
<P>
   Lategano-Nicholas, 35, has since left City Hall and now heads
the city's tourism bureau.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has denied having a romantic relationship with
Lategano-Nicholas, and Lategano-Nicholas said Wednesday, ''I have
no desire to speculate why Donna Hanover decided to issue the
statement that she did.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and Hanover have not appeared in public together in
years, although the mayor has been seen at both public and private
functions with Nathan in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's press conference, the mayor said he had
''tremendous respect'' for his wife. He went on to describe Nathan
as ''a very, very kind person.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I rely on her and she's helped me a great deal. And I'm going
to need her more now than maybe I did before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan, a registered nurse who is an executive with a
pharmaceutical company, emerged from her Manhattan apartment
briefly Wednesday only to ask for privacy.

<HEADLINE> Mortgage Rates Hit Five-Year High  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mortgages rates shot up this week with 30-year
and 15-year mortgages reaching their highest levels since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The average interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages
climbed to 8.52 percent for the week ending May 12 from 8.28
percent the previous week, according to a survey released Thursday
by Freddie Mac, the mortgage company. This time a year ago, 30-year
mortgages averaged 7.10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This week's 8.52 percent rate was the highest since March 10,
1995, when the 30-year rate averaged 8.62 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing, also
rose this week to 8.17 percent, up from 7.94 percent. This time a
year ago, 15-year mortgages were at 6.71 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The 8.17 percent rate also was the highest since March 10, 1995,
when 15-year mortgage rate averaged 8.24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an
average initial rate of 6.96 percent this week, up from 6.90
percent last week.
</P>
<P>
   The rates do not include add-on fees known as points, which
averaged at or just over 1 percent of the loan amount for all three
types of mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   ''Long-term interest rates jumped this week in anticipation of
the Fed's actions next week,'' said Freddie Mac's chief economist
Robert Van Order. ''News that inflation finally reared its ugly
head has increased the perception that the Fed will raise rates by
50 basis points (a half percentage point) instead of the 25 that
had been previously expected.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve, which has boosted interest rates five times
by a quarter-point each since June 30, meets Tuesday and economists

<HEADLINE> Fossils Found in Georgia Republic  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL RECER, AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fossils unearthed in the Republic of Georgia
and dated at 1.7 million years old may be from the first humanlike
species to migrate from Africa, possibly the ancestral home of all
humans.
</P>
<P>
   A team of researchers reports in the journal Science that parts
of two skulls found by accident at the site of a medieval castle
are the fossilized remains of an early human species called Homo
erectus thought to have arisen in Africa about 1.8 million years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery suggests the early Homo erectus became the first
two-legged migrants within a few thousand years of their
evolutionary appearance in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the first time that we have seen fossils that look very
much like Africa fossils outside of Africa,'' said Susan C. Anton,
a co-author of the study. ''We believe these fossils represent the
first (humanlike) species to move out of Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   The study will appear in Science on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Anton, an expert on early humans at the University of Florida,
Gainesville, said the fossils were discovered with primitive stone
tools -- little more than rock flakes -- that were first developed in
Africa about 1.8 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier studies had suggested that human migration from Africa
waited for the development about 1.6 million years ago of more
sophisticated stone tools, called Acheulean tools, before they left
the cradle continent and dispersed into the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   But Anton said the new finding shows it was biology, not new
technology, that prompted the dispersal.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are hominids with bigger brains and bodies than the ones
who came before,'' said Anton. ''The ability to disperse may have
something to do with this biological change.''
</P>
<P>
   Homo erectus, which is called Homo ergaster by some experts, had
more animal fat and meat in its diet than earlier hominids, she
said. The drive for meat may have prompted the species to leave
Africa in search of better hunting grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Dating of the fossils is key to the conclusions, and co-author
Carl C. Swisher III of the Berkeley Geochronology Center in
California said the age of 1.7 million years is nailed down in
three different ways.
</P>
<P>
   A lava layer found just below the fossils was chemically dated
at 1.8 million years. Found with the human remains were fossils of
a rodent known to have lived only between 2 million and 1.6 million
years ago. And, finally, rocks found with the fossils bear the
signature of change in the Earth's magnetic polarity that is known
to have happened 1.7 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything fits on the age,'' said Swisher. ''There is no
discrepancy.''

<HEADLINE> Cop Kick Falun Gong Protesters  </HEADLINE>
By CHARLES HUTZLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Police on Thursday tackled, kicked and dragged
away dozens of devotees of the banned Falun Gong sect who attempted
to mark the birthday of their movement's founder in Beijing's
central Tiananmen square.
</P>
<P>
   Sect followers who dropped to the paving stones to meditate or
tried to unfurl banners were swiftly snatched up by plainclothes
and uniformed security officers and forced inside waiting vans.
Police kicked several followers after they were shoved into the
vans and one woman who ran from officers was tackled and sent
sprawling.
</P>
<P>
   Security officers raced through the square to stop the protests
and by midmorning had detained some 50 followers -- among them a
middle aged woman. Police vans circled the plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Two Western tourists were also detained by police, apparently
for taking photographs of the demonstrations. At least three
foreign journalists had their film confiscated.
</P>
<P>
   The protest seemed much like a replay of the confrontation
between sect members and police on April 25 when followers gathered
for the first anniversary of a demonstration by 10,000
practitioners. The 1999 demonstration had shocked China's leaders,
and three months later they banned the group as a public menace and
a threat to Communist Party rule.
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong followers have continued to stage protests nearly
every day in Tiananmen Square, despite 9{ months of repression, a
smear campaign in the state media and the jailing of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's demonstration was unusually large.
</P>
<P>
   The day marked what Chinese traditionally regard as the
anniversary of the birth of Buddhism's founder, Gautama Siddharta.
Falun Gong followers believe their master, Li Hongzhi, was born on
that day as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''Chinese practitioners assume this is the date to honor the
master,'' said Gail Rachlin, a spokeswoman for Falun Gong in New
York. She expected more protests Saturday, Li's birthday by the
Western calendar and the anniversary of Falun Gong's founding in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials say records show that Li was born on July 7,
1952 and accuse him of changing his birth date to add to his
mystique.
</P>
<P>
   The sect's leader has not been seen in public since shortly
after China banned Falun Gong last July and few clues are available
as to his whereabouts. Li left China for New York in 1998 after the
government quietly banned his books, and the group's overseas Web
sites show a picture of him meditating in the mountains without
saying when or where the photograph was taken.
</P>
<P>
   A former government grain clerk, Li founded Falun Gong as an
offshoot of traditional slow-motion exercises known as qi gong. To
those, he added a blend of Buddhist and Taoist philosophy and his
own often unorthodox ideas. Followers claim that practice promotes
health and good citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government, however, has accused the group of
causing 1,559 deaths -- mostly among devotees who refused medical
treatment -- leading to psychiatric problems in 600 others and
cheating people by making them spend lavishly on books and
teachings.
</P>
<P>
   The government claimed victory anew over the group Thursday. In
an editorial carried in national newspapers, the official Xinhua
News Agency claimed that 98 percent of all Falun Gong followers had
severed ties to the group.
</P>
<P>
   ''The victory has greatly raised the political vigilance of the
nation, saved and protected a large number of the cheated, punished
the evil and maintained the social stability of the country,''
Xinhua said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 153; Nasdaq Up 83  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly higher today as a report of a
slowdown in retail sales calmed investors who have been selling
stocks amid fears about rising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 153.18 at 10,520.96.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Nasdaq composite
index was up 83.43 at 3,468.16, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was up 20.20 at 1,403.25.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks rose after the Commerce Department said retail sales fell
0.2 percent. Economists had expected a increase of 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were quick to cite bad weather in April that kept many
Americans out of the stores. But the decline raised some hopes that
the Federal Reserve's series of interest rate increases is
succeeding in slowing consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed is widely expected to raise interest rates again at
meeting on Tuesday. Economists are divided on whether central
bankers will stick to their strategy of boosting rates by a
quarter-percentage point at a time, or whether they will opt for a
half-percentage point increase this time.
</P>
<P>
   The retail sales report alone won't dissuade the Fed from the
harsher, half-point increase, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appears that the volatile stock market and higher interest
rates have started to slow consumer spending,'' said Stan Shipley,
senior economist at Merrill Lynch. ''However, this one-month
slowdown should not derail the Fed.''
</P>
<P>
   Rate-sensitive stocks rose after the retail sales report was
released. J.P. Morgan rose 4 9/16 to 127 3/16, and Citigroup rose 1
13/16 to 58\.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, which fell sharply on Wednesday, rebounded 7 3/16 to
113\, the strongest gain among all 30 Dow components.
</P>
<P>
   But some skittishness in the technology sector prevailed.
Applied Materials recovered from a steep early drop but remained
down ] at 84\. After the close of trading Wednesday, the company
reported operating earnings of 55 cents a share, in line with
analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said Applied Materials failed to get a bounce from the
strong earnings report because many investors were hoping for the
company, a leading maker of equipment used in the semiconductor
industry, to exceed estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2-to-1 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 637.73 million
shares, slightly behind Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 10.90 to
485.18.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. stocks overcame a sharp selloff in Japan. The Nikkei stock
average plunged 4.63 percent to its lowest close in 7{ months, with
technology, telecommunications and financial-services stocks
leading the way down. Traders blamed the weakness on Wall Street's
decline on Wednesday, when the Dow fell 168 points and the Nasdaq
plunged 200 points.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Drug Prices Cut for Africa  </HEADLINE>
By NAOMI KOPPEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- Five pharmaceutical companies announced Thursday
they would slash the cost of HIV/AIDS drugs in African and other
poor nations, which have complained that they are priced out of
treating the epidemic ravaging their populations.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement received a cautious welcome from the government
of South Africa and the medical aid group Doctors Without Borders,
though they worried about possible strings on the offer.
</P>
<P>
   The move came a day after President Clinton signed an executive
order making it easier for African nations to get access to cheaper
drugs. The order backs off patent enforcement that could stop them
from getting generic versions of U.S.-made HIV/AIDS medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Health workers have regularly complained that the high cost of
patented AIDS drugs has effectively blocked patients from getting
the care they need in Sub-Saharan Africa, which has 80 percent of
the world's HIV-positive population.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's announcement, the two U.S. and three European
companies said they were joining together to work with governments
and agencies in developing countries to reduce the price of the
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Only one company, Britain's Glaxo Wellcome, was immediately
ready to announce what it would offer. Spokesman Ben Plumley said
the two-drug package Combivir would be made available at a cost of
$2 per day. It currently sells in the United States for $16.50 --
though it is somewhat cheaper in developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   The other companies involved are Germany's Boehringer Ingelheim,
Roche of Switzerland, Bristol-Myers Squibb of New York and Merck
and Co. of Whitehouse Station, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   They will work with five international agencies -- UNAIDS, the
World Health Organization, the World Bank, the U.N. Population Fund
and the U.N. Children's Fund.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa said it was worried the companies might attach
conditions to their offers -- particularly that governments not
pursue importing cheaper, generic versions of the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this offer is attached to a condition that governments like
South Africa should not pursue generic substitution, parallel
importing and compulsory licensing, then it is not genuine and
unacceptable,'' said Patricia Lambert, spokeswoman for the health
ministry.
</P>
<P>
   The Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders
also said it wanted to know more.
</P>
<P>
   ''We appreciate this announcement, but we are reticent because
we don't know all the details of the offer,'' said spokeswoman
Catherine Gavin.
</P>
<P>
   She said the offer seems to cover ''retrovirals,'' drugs that
rein in the HIV virus and prevent it from becoming full-blown AIDS,
but it was not clear if it covers drugs to treat the infections
that attack AIDS patients, whose immune systems have broken down.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this moment we still have a tremendous number of
questions,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Roche spokeswoman Jacqueline Wallach said decisions about which
Roche drugs would be reduced in price would be made in the next few
months.
</P>
<P>
   Rolf Krebs, vice chairman of the board of Boehringer Ingelheim,
stressed that the move marks ''the first time that both the public
and private sector are joining forces to implement a major change
in the care of HIV/AIDS in the developing world.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Thursday praised Clinton's
executive order, which the president issued after Congress rejected
similar legislation. The order is a ''strong indication to the
patients that they are not being abandoned,'' Annan told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Piot, head of UNAIDS, welcomed the drug companies' offer
but said it was only the first step.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lowering the price of medicines is only one critical factor in
what must become a much broader and more urgent effort to help
people living with HIV and AIDS lead healthier and more productive
lives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need significant new funding that is on a level with the
enormous human, social and economic challenges now being posed by
the epidemic.''

<HEADLINE> Public OKd For Stonehenge Solstice  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The public will be able to greet the dawn of the
millennium's first summer at the ancient stone circle of
Stonehenge, the first time in 16 years the site has been opened for
the summer solstice.
</P>
<P>
   Stonehenge will be opened the night of June 20 for eight hours
under tight security, the watchdog body English Heritage announced
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Camping, fires, dogs and amplified music will be forbidden at
the site on Salisbury Plain, 80 miles southwest of London.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Stonehenge -- a stone circle erected by prehistoric
Britons 5,000 years ago -- has been a magnet for unruly revelers.
During the 1980s, a four-mile exclusion zone was established around
the stones on solstice night following a series of disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, 100 people were allowed to attend the solstice by prior
arrangement, but riot police had to be called in last year after
gatecrashers pushed down fences and clambered on the stones.
</P>
<P>
   The solstice is the holiest day of the year for druids, who
consider Stonehenge a sacred site.
</P>
<P>
   English Heritage spokeswoman Elspeth Henderson said a decision
would be made after the event about whether to continue the
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a little bit unpredictable, obviously,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> European Interest Rates Unchanged  </HEADLINE>
By HANS GREIMEL, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- European Central Bank president Wim
Duisenberg refused to take the role of scapegoat Thursday over the
euro's decline, keeping the door open to the possibility of market
intervention and variable interest rates in his continuing battle
to keep consumer prices stable.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not prepared to take the blame for the decline in the
euro,'' Duisenberg said after the ECB's governing council decided
to keep its key interest rate steady at 3.75 percent during its
regular, twice-monthly meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are achieving the main goal we at the ECB were hired for --
achieving price stability,'' Duisenberg said, denying rumors he
would resign.
</P>
<P>
   His comments echoed those made by the ECB last Friday after
traders made a run on the euro, sending it to a record low of 88.45
cents. The dive compelled finance ministers and the ECB to issue a
rare joint statement expressing support for the common currency,
which is shared by 11 European countries.
</P>
<P>
   After Thursday's rate decision, the euro dropped a quarter of a
cent to 90.56 cents and languished around that level for the rest
of the afternoon. In New York, the euro was trading at 90.10 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the stock markets barely budged after the expected
decision, though many finished the day higher, cheered by news from
the United States about weaker-than-expected consumer spending
data.
</P>
<P>
   The euro has lost 24 percent of its value since debuting in
January 1999. Nonethless, Duisenberg repeated the ECB's cheery
mantra Thursday, underlining rosy forecasts for economic growth and
trying to reassure average citizens that the withering euro is not
draining their pocketbooks.
</P>
<P>
   ''The citizens of Europe can be confident that their savings and
pensions will keep their value over time,'' Duisenberg said. ''How
can one call a currency characterized by stable prices weak? I
don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Inflation in the region peaked at 2.1 percent in March, but is
expected to tail off for the rest of the year and remain below the
ECB's mandate of keeping price rises under 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem on the horizon is that a weak euro could push
inflation higher again by driving up the prices of imports, which
can spill over into higher consumer prices at the corner store.
</P>
<P>
   Boosting interest rates is one weapon the ECB could have used to
bolster the value of the faltering euro. But the bank kept its
hands off Thursday -- after increasing its main refinancing rate by
a quarter-percentage point to 3.75 percent just two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is best for today is for the ECB to just sit and wait,''
said Bernhard Pfaff, an economist with Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
''Markets are pretty nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Duisenberg would not rule out using two other tools that
could turn the euro around: intervention in currency markets by
buying up the currency and selling dollars, or switching to
variable interest rate system.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, rumors that the central bank would buy euros and sell
dollars halted the euro's tumble and pushed it back over the 90
cent mark.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is for the bank to shift from a fixed interest
rate of 3.75 percent to a variable rate. Variable rates are set by
banks telling the ECB not only how much money they want to borrow,
but also what interest rate they want to borrow at.
</P>
<P>
   That can lead to overall higher interest rates. But it can also
leave the ECB's main interest rates exposed to the ravages of
market speculation that could boost rates too high, too fast.
</P>
<P>
   Duisenberg said switching to variable rates Thursday would be
the wrong thing to do, although he said such a switch could still
be down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ''In volatile and violent markets which we are going through
now, we didn't want to install a new element of uncertainty and
volatility,'' he said.

<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Rick Thoman, just 13 months into his
tenure as chief executive officer of troubled business machines
manufacturer Xerox Corp., was fired Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Thoman was asked by members of the board of directors to resign,
a source familiar with Thursday's events told The Associated Press.
An announcement from the company was expected after the stock
market closed Thursday afternoon, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox spokeswoman Crista Carone said the company had no
immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox last month reported a $243 million loss in the first
quarter and has struggled for more than a year with slumping sales
and a balky sales force restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   The loss had been expected following the announcement in March
that the company would lay off 5,200 employees and close several
plants.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox took a pretax charge of $625 million to cover the
restructuring. The company also took a pretax charge of $27 million
for research and development costs associated with its acquisition
of Tektronix Inc.'s color printer division.
</P>
<P>
   Before the two extraordinary charges, Xerox had quarterly
earnings of $220 million, or 30 cents per share, down 36 percent
compared with $343 million, or 48 cents per share, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues in the quarter rose 3 percent to $4.43 billion, up from
$4.30 billion in the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Thoman, former chief financial officer at IBM, was hired as the
No. 2 executive at Xerox in June 1997. A cost-cutter who helped
reverse IBM's declining fortunes, he was seen as a leader who could
help Xerox regain its dominant position in the small and large
office machine markets.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox, best known for its photocopying machines, has struggled
against Hewlett-Packard and Canon in the small and home-office
markets.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate word on a successor to Thoman.

<HEADLINE> Gunmen Ambush Russian Troop Convoy  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GALASHKI, Russia (AP) -- Rebel gunmen burst out of a wooded ditch
Thursday and ambushed a Russian troop convoy in a region west of
Chechnya, killing 18 soldiers in the first major attack outside the
breakaway republic in months, the military said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials warned that the raid signaled the Chechens'
intention to expand their fight to other Russian territories and
urged strengthened police control over regions bordering Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Russia succeeded Thursday in avoiding punitive action
from the Council of Europe, long critical of Russia's treatment of
civilians in Chechnya. Russia promised to investigate human rights
violations and allow international organizations in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's attack, the convoy was passing along a wooded,
upward-sloping section of road in the Russian republic of
Ingushetia when gunmen opened fire with automatic weapons and
grenade launchers, Russian military investigators on the scene told
The Associated Press. They spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The convoy's captain Sergei Maziyev, the only one of the 22
servicemen to escape unharmed, told reporters that the attack near
the village of Galashki happened too quickly for the soldiers to
put up serious resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen were killed immediately, two died of wounds on the way
to hospital, and three were wounded. The unit had finished its tour
and the men were heading home when they were attacked, the military
said.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether any of the attackers was harmed.
</P>
<P>
   Russian special forces were searching the surrounding hills and
woods for the gunmen, and sappers could be seen searching for mines
believed to have been left by the attackers.
</P>
<P>
   Ingushetia, which borders Chechnya, has been the site of
occasional crossover attacks by Chechen rebels, and Russia has a
heavy military presence there. The border has been a key crossing
for some 200,000 refugees fleeing the fighting in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen rebels have been stepping up ambushes on Russian convoys
in the last two months, killing at least 100 soldiers inside
Chechnya. Russian officials were convinced the gunmen in Thursday's
attack were Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is alarming because it shows that the rebels are aiming
to spread the conflict, expand the war zone to neighboring
territories,'' said the Kremlin's spokesman on Chechnya, Sergei
Yastrzhembsky.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Gen. Gennady Troshev, commander of Russian troops in the
region, urged police in neighboring Russian republics to step up
controls of everyone leaving Chechnya, even refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops entered Chechnya after Chechnya-based militants
seized villages in Dagestan in August. Moscow says the offensive is
aimed at quashing terrorists and the violence that had plagued the
region since a 1994-6 Chechnya war.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has come under intense international criticism over the
war, and the Strasbourg-based Council of Europe, the continent's
top human rights body, has denied Russia its voting rights in the
council's parliamentary assembly to protest Russia's treatment of
civilians in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday, Council of Europe nations chose a more
conciliatory stance and decided to take no immediate action against
Russia over its handling of the Chechen war. It welcomed statements
by Russian President Vladimir Putin that human rights abuses will
be punished.
</P>
<P>
   Following threats that Europe's main human rights watchdog would
suspend Russia over allegations of abuses, Russia pledged to
cooperate with international institutions that want to investigate
the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Not including Thursday's attack, 2,233 Russian servicemen have
been killed since August, the military said Thursday. That did not
include unconfirmed rebel attacks, such as one Wednesday in which
rebels claimed to have killed 30 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Russian military and the rebels exaggerate the other
side's losses while playing down their own.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Chechnya, the military said federal jets flew 12 sorties
to bomb suspected rebel positions in southern Chechnya over the
past 24 hours. Combat helicopters also flew 30 flights.

<HEADLINE> Actors Test for 'Star Wars' Role  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A little-known Canadian actor appears to have
the inside track for the plum role of Anakin Skywalker in the next
two ''Star Wars'' movies.
</P>
<P>
   Hayden Christensen was among four actors who did screen tests
this month opposite ''Phantom Menace'' co-star Natalie Portman, and
the actor is awaiting an announcement from George Lucas that he
landed the part, Diana Larkin, one of Christensen's managers, said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The trade magazine Variety and other news outlets reported that
Christensen had the part, but Larkin said LucasFilms had asked the
actor's managers not to confirm the deal until Lucas' announcement,
expected within a few days.
</P>
<P>
   ''His name's out there, so it's pretty much public record, but
we have to wait for the official word,'' Larkin said.
</P>
<P>
   LucasFilms spokeswoman Jeanne Cole said the company had no
comment on the role of Anakin, the character that grows up to be
the villain Darth Vader from the original ''Star Wars'' trilogy.
Jake Lloyd played Anakin as a boy in last year's ''Star Wars:
Episode I -- The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   Christensen, 19, is a regular in the Fox series ''Higher
Ground'' and appeared in the movie ''The Virgin Suicides.''
</P>
<P>
   The next ''Star Wars'' episode begins shooting in June in
Australia.

<HEADLINE> Parishioners and priests offer new archbishop prayers and good wishes </HEADLINE>
By JUDIE GLAVE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Bishop Edward M. Egan's appointment by Pope John
Paul II as the ninth archbishop of New York was received Thursday
with prayers and good wishes from parishioners and those who know
him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he's a man of vision and foresight,'' said Monsignor
Peter Finn, who worked in the archdiocese's press office when Egan
was an auxiliary bishop here.
</P>
<P>
   The pope announced this morning that Egan, 68, would succeed
Cardinal John O'Connor, who died May 3 of brain cancer. And at his
first news conference since taking the helm, Egan seemed at ease
with the press.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't feel like the boss, but give me time and I will,'' he
said with a broad smile. ''I want to be a New Yorker,'' he said at
one point.
</P>
<P>
   ''Archbishop Egan will be a strong and dynamic leader, and he
brings many priestly gifts and talents to this challenging
responsibility,'' said Archbishop Theodore McCarrick of Newark,
N.J., a onetime candidate to succeed O'Connor. ''His mission of
energetic and caring, pastoral leadership of the Church of
Bridgeport has well prepared him for the leadership of this most
important American diocese.''
</P>
<P>
   Monsignor Finn, who is now pastor at St. Joseph-St. Thomas
Church in Staten Island, predicted Egan would be well-received in
New York. He called Egan ''a very energetic and forward looking
leader'' and remembered him as ''a man with a wonderful sense of
humor, a bright man.''
</P>
<P>
   Egan has been bishop of the Bridgeport, Conn. diocese since
December 1988, but he earlier served 3{ years as an auxiliary
bishop and vicar of education in New York.
</P>
<P>
   At St. Patrick's Cathedral -- the Fifth Avenue landmark and seat
of Egan's new archdiocese -- prayers were offered for him at two
early morning Masses. Parishioners going in and out of the
cathedral said they would welcome the new archbishop's leadership --
though many noted O'Connor still was greatly missed.
</P>
<P>
   ''He looks like a good man,'' said Elssy Mino, 58, a saleswoman
from Bayside, Queens. ''Nobody's going to replace O'Connor, but I
think Egan will be OK. He seems very sweet and nice.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Sure, O'Connor is a hard act to follow, but so was Spellman,''
said Martin Shanahan, a consultant from New Jersey, who often
attends Mass at St. Patrick's. ''He'll do fine.''
</P>
<P>
   ''People are open minded and so it'll be just fine,'' Marc
Taylor, a financial analyst from Queens said outside the cathedral.
''After all, it's really between you and the man upstairs.''
</P>
<P>
   The telegenic Cardinal Francis Spellman headed the archdiocese
during the 1950s and turbulent 1960s -- a time of vast change in the
Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Auxiliary Bishop Patrick Ahern, of Manhattan's Church of
St. Thomas More, said the archdiocese's 2.4 million Catholics could
not help but make comparisons between Egan and O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course, there will always be noticeable differences,'' said
Ahern. ''Everybody's fingerprint is unique and each comes to his
task bringing his own talents, charisma, intelligence and
abilities.''
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Ahern said O'Connor was a true preacher who
enjoyed celebrating Sunday Mass. Egan rarely led services in
Bridgeport.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor's predecessors, Cardinal Terence Cooke and Spellman,
rarely celebrated Masses either.
</P>
<P>
   Egan was known in Bridgeport for his fundraising abilities and
efforts to bring new priests into the diocese.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to remember that Cardinal O'Connor was as different
from Cardinal Cooke as chalk from cheese,'' said Ahern. ''Different
personalities but both served New York well, as I'm sure Bishop
Egan will.''
</P>
<P>
   Egan becomes the 12th bishop of New York and ninth archbishop.
New York was a diocese, run by a bishop, from 1808 until 1850 when
it was elevated to an archdiocese. It stretches across 10 counties
and includes three boroughs in the city -- Manhattan, the Bronx and
Staten Island -- and seven northern suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Though some in Catholic circles expressed surprise at Egan's
appointment, in part because many archbishops retire at 75, Ahern
did not see it as a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has a lot of steam in his engine; a lot of energy, a lot of
gifts left to give,'' the 81-year-old Ahern said of the new
archbishop.

<HEADLINE> Census Bureau Says It's Telling All  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans produced a Census Bureau
memo Thursday they said proves the agency is not fully cooperating
with Congress on monitoring the count, a claim later denied by the
census chief.
</P>
<P>
   The memo, from an unidentified Los Angeles census area manager,
instructed lower-ranking officials not to provide certain daily
progress reports to the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress that is helping oversee the count.
</P>
<P>
   The memo, released by Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., says in part,
''This report must and can not be shared with any GAO
representative.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, chairman of the House Government Reform Committee's
census panel, said the memo ''severely calls into question the
Census Bureau's credibility.'' He said he did not believe it was an
isolated decision made by one midlevel manager.
</P>
<P>
   ''What documents have been, or will be, hidden from the bright
lights of scrutiny?'' Miller said at a hearing Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Miller, Census Bureau Director Kenneth Prewitt
said there is ''no policy'' at the agency to refuse any information
sought by the GAO and that the information in the memo is available
to investigators directly, in real time, on a computer system.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt also said that not all lower-level and midlevel staff
''fully understand our standing policies with respect to oversight
and access, and therefore are tasked not to immediately process
that request but to report to upper management.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have locked horns repeatedly with the Clinton
administration over the Census Bureau's use of sampling techniques
and comments by some GOP leaders that people should not answer the
53-question long form if they believe it is too intrusive. The
count has huge political overtones, including determining districts
for state legislatures and Congress and how much federal money
flows to different parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., said Miller was jumping to
conclusions in alleging the memo demonstrates some ''vast
conspiracy'' to hide information.
</P>
<P>
   Census Bureau spokesman Steve Jost noted that the memo surfaced
just before GAO testimony showing that the count response rate of
65 percent is running better than anticipated, halting a
three-decade downward slide.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's regrettable that the system has to focus on a garbled
e-mail message from one of our half-million employees,'' Jost said.

<HEADLINE> Clint Eastwood Fights Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARMEL, Calif. (AP) -- Clint Eastwood says he wasn't given enough
time to comply with a request to make his Mission Ranch Hotel more
handicapped-accessible.
</P>
<P>
   The actor and former mayor of this seaside town is fighting a
lawsuit filed three years ago by a hotel guest who uses a
wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   The guest claims Eastwood didn't comply quickly enough to her
complaint that the parking lot and at least one bathroom were in
violation of the federal Americans With Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood is supporting a bill that would give business owners 90
days to comply with the act.
</P>
<P>
   He said his beef isn't with the law but with trial lawyers who
are ''extorting'' businesses with unwarranted lawsuits over the
act.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood bought the $4 million hotel and spent $6.7 million to
renovate it but will not spend the $7,000 or so it would take to
fix at least the women's bathroom in the hotel office, said Paul
Rein, lawyer for Diane Zum Brunnen, who brought the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had no idea he was going to use this case to try and
emasculate the law,'' Rein said.

<HEADLINE> Isaac Stern Takes on New Students  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Isaac Stern, who has coached budding violinists
for decades, took on a new group of students -- school
administrators.
</P>
<P>
   The 43 administrators, many of them touching violins for the
first time, played the role of students Wednesday at Carnegie Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just put the violin on the shoulder, voomp!'' Stern said,
lifting his own instrument to the proper position.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the squawky half-hour lesson, the superintendents
had participated in several rounds of ''Ach, du Lieber Augustin,''
a German folk song. Stern played most of it, with the
superintendents joining in on the last two notes of each line.
</P>
<P>
   Interim Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy persuaded Stern, 79,
to give the superintendents a lesson in hopes they would place a
higher priority on music instruction for students.
</P>
<P>
   Stern said he was thrilled to participate and called music ''the
biggest key I know to a truly educated life.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Patient Rights Bill  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hoping to jump-start negotiations stalled in
Congress, President Clinton met with lawmakers today and urged them
to finish work on legislation giving Americans more leverage when
dealing with their health plans.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are here to determine what the issues are and what the
processes are to resolve them,'' Clinton said as the meeting opened
at the White House. He sat next to Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla.,
chairman of the committee working on a compromise bill, and was
surrounded by other congressional leaders of both parties whose
committees have jurisdiction over health insurance plans.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, who was not at the meeting, issued
a statement saying he had discussed the HMO issue privately with
the president on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators have made ''slow but steady progress over the last
several months, the president and I agree that we need to bring
closure to the remaining differences between the House and
Senate,'' it said. Hastert added that ''we are very close to
completing a balanced bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the meeting was closed to the press. Clinton planned to
tell lawmakers he was impatient with the slow progress of their
negotiations to reconcile the House and Senate versions of patient
protection legislation, according to a White House statement.
</P>
<P>
   The president also was to criticize a plan offered by Senate
Republicans because it would not cover all Americans in health
plans and had ''weak enforcement provisions'' that do not expand
patients' rights to sue their health plans if they are harmed by
decisions to deny care.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton favors a House-passed bill that would cover all
Americans and expand rights to sue.
</P>
<P>
   Bipartisan negotiators who have worked for 11 weeks on a
patient' bill of rights have made some progress in reaching a
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   But the conference committee has yet to tackle thorny questions
about who should be covered by the federal protections and whether
the bill should allow patients to sue health plans for damages.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called the meeting to help lawmakers work through their
differences and stress that this legislation was one of his top
priorities, administration officials said.

<HEADLINE> Serial killer to be sentenced Friday  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) -- The sentencing of serial killer Michael
Ross could start a whole new round of appeals and legal arguments
about how the death penalty is administered in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Barring any last-minute defense motions for life in prison,
Superior Court Judge Thomas P. Miano on Friday will impose six
death sentences on Ross.
</P>
<P>
   Miano is bound by a jury's verdict that Ross, 40, should die for
kidnapping and killing four teen-age girls in New London County in
the 1980s. He was convicted in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of Ross' victims and people in favor of a life
sentence for Ross may speak at the sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut Supreme Court automatically reviews all death
sentences. Additional federal appeals are possible.
</P>
<P>
   Ross, in an interview from death row at Northern Correctional
Institution in Somers last month, said he respects the jury's
verdict and does not want his lawyers to file any non-mandatory
appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been 16 years,'' Ross said. ''You know, it's got to end.
I can't let this go another 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The victims were Robin Stavinsky, 19, of Norwich; Wendy
Baribeault, 17, of Jewett City; and two 14-year-old friends, Leslie
Shelley and April Brunais, both of Griswold.
</P>
<P>
   Ross already is serving two life sentences for killing Tammy
Williams, 17, of Brooklyn and Debra Smith Taylor, 23, of Griswold.
</P>
<P>
   Ross preyed on the girls as they walked or hitchhiked down quiet
country roads in eastern Connecticut. He raped some of them.
</P>
<P>
   In his defense, he claimed a disorder called sexual sadism drove
him to rape and kill -- a defense the jury rejected.
</P>
<P>
   It may take years for Ross' case to reach the state Supreme
Court. The review can be limited to the appropriateness of the
sentence, or can be broader to include allegations of error during
the death-penalty hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Such an appeal in 1994 upheld Ross' conviction but found that
information was withheld from the defense that might have helped
Ross get life in prison. The high court ordered a new penalty
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers raised numerous issues at Ross' monthlong
penalty trial that may be used in an appeal. Miano and the lawyers
were forging new law for death penalty cases, since Ross was the
first person in Connecticut to have one penalty hearing for four
murders.
</P>
<P>
   Public defenders who are representing Ross also want to use his
case to highlight alleged racial inequalities in the death penalty
system. Ross is white and his victims were white, but lawyers think
Ross' case is part of a pattern where all death penalty victims are
white.
</P>
<P>
   Ross' case already has taken several roller-coaster rides
through the legal system.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Ross and prosecutors reached a written agreement to
waive appeals and put Ross to death. The Supreme Court refused to
answer questions about the legality of the deal and Miano later
rejected it.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of a new penalty hearing last summer, the case ended
up before the high court again over ground rules for the
prosecution and the defense in the hearing.

<HEADLINE> Dow Climbs 198; Nasdaq Up 100  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were higher today as a report of a
slowdown in retail sales calmed investors who have been selling
stocks amid fears about rising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 198.41 at 10,566.19.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Nasdaq composite
index was up 100.49 at 3,485.22, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index rose 26.85 to 1,409.90.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks rose after the Commerce Department said retail sales fell
0.2 percent. Economists had expected a increase of 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were quick to cite bad weather in April that kept many
Americans out of the stores. But the decline raised some hopes that
the Federal Reserve's series of interest rate increases is
succeeding in slowing consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed is widely expected to raise interest rates again at
meeting on Tuesday. Economists are divided on whether central
bankers will stick to their strategy of boosting rates by a
quarter-percentage point at a time, or whether they will opt for a
half-percentage point increase this time.
</P>
<P>
   The retail sales report alone won't dissuade the Fed from the
harsher, half-point increase, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appears that the volatile stock market and higher interest
rates have started to slow consumer spending,'' said Stan Shipley,
senior economist at Merrill Lynch. ''However, this one-month
slowdown should not derail the Fed.''
</P>
<P>
   Rate-sensitive stocks rose after the retail sales report was
released. J.P. Morgan rose 5| to 128\, and Citigroup rose 2] to 58
13/16.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, which fell sharply on Wednesday, rebounded 9 7/16 to
115{, the strongest gain among all 30 Dow components.
</P>
<P>
   Bargain-hunting opportunities lured some investors into the
technology sector. High-tech stocks have been battered in recent
sessions, leaving their prices significantly lower than they were
earlier this year, before the Nasdaq began its initial descent from
record levels. Today, Texas Instruments was up 10} to 140, and
Micron Technology was up 6} to 57.
</P>
<P>
   But some skittishness in the technology sector prevailed.
Applied Materials recovered from a steep early drop but was up just
3/16 at 84 13/16. After the close of trading Wednesday, the company
reported operating earnings of 55 cents a share, in line with
analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said Applied Materials failed to get a bounce from the
strong earnings report because many investors were hoping for the
company, a leading maker of equipment used in the semiconductor
industry, to exceed estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2-to-1 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 756.87 million
shares, slightly behind Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 11.48 to
485.76.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. stocks overcame a sharp selloff in Japan. The Nikkei stock
average plunged 4.63 percent to its lowest close in 7{ months, with
technology, telecommunications and financial-services stocks
leading the way down. Traders blamed the weakness on Wall Street's
decline on Wednesday, when the Dow fell 168 points and the Nasdaq
plunged 200 points.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Helps American Tourists  </HEADLINE>
By JOCELYN GECKER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- As the elevator begins its climb up the Eiffel
Tower, the voices in one corner have a Texas twang. Nearby are a
couple from New York and two women from San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Americans visiting Paris -- and Europe as a whole -- are hardly
unusual. But as this year's tourist season gets underway, the old
world is far cheaper for holders of U.S. dollars, and more and more
Americans are cashing in on European vacations.
</P>
<P>
   The European Travel Commission estimates that a record 12
million American tourists will visit Europe this year, spurred by a
strong dollar and bargain airfares. That would top 1999's record
11.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Americans have found some European countries more
affordable than others, due to different currencies. Now, they're
almost uniformally cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   A depreciating euro -- the single currency for 11 European
nations -- has shed roughly 25 percent of its value since its
creation 16 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   While the euro doesn't go into circulation until 2002, local
currencies are pegged to it. That means travelers exchanging
dollars for currencies fixed to the euro can stuff their wallets
with one-quarter more foreign cash.
</P>
<P>
   ''Americans are getting most of Europe at the best prices we've
seen in 12 years or more'' said Einar Gustavsson, U.S. chairman of
the New York-based European Travel Commission, which represents 29
European countries. England, whose currency is not linked to the
euro, is among the exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   One American woman who travels frequently called it the sale of
the century.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were just in Italy ... It was a gold mine,'' Susan Goodwill
of San Francisco said while circling an observation deck at the
Eiffel Tower.
</P>
<P>
   Treasures were found at design houses Chanel and Hermes, where
the 54-year-old consultant said she paid the equivalent of $240 for
a designer diary that costs $400 in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ''The jewelry at Cartier was a good deal too,'' Goodwill said.
</P>
<P>
   A Munich hotel room that would have run $100 a night last year
costs $78, at current exchange rates; a bottle of French burgundy
that cost $30 a year ago now is $23, according to a study by the
commission.
</P>
<P>
   At Rome's Piazza Navona, a cappuccino in an outdoor cafe
overlooking Bernini's fountains can be sipped for about $2.80 (lire
6,000). A year ago it would have cost $4.50.
</P>
<P>
   Dining at Paris's famed three-star Michelin restaurants, while
still pricey, is more affordable. An 850-franc dinner for one at
the ritzy Grand Vefour now tips the scales at $118, compared to
$150 a year ago. Wine is extra.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorker Lisa Polikov said she was stunned to find that
gourmet Paris restaurants cost less than those in New York's trendy
Soho district. That wasn't the only pleasant surprise during a
recent four-day stay.
</P>
<P>
   ''My girlfriend had told me: 'You are not going to find a hotel
in Paris with your own bathroom for under $100,''' said Polikov, a
30-year-old free-lance editor. She recommends the Latin quarter for
''very clean'' and affordable lodging.
</P>
<P>
   Americans aren't the only ones who will crowd Europe tourist
spots.
</P>
<P>
   At EuroDisney in Paris, a spokesman said that the dollar's
strength is also expected to draw more European visitors, who would
find U.S. Disney parks more expensive than before.
</P>
<P>
   But the surge in American tourists already has begun.
</P>
<P>
   While the high season hasn't yet started in several Scandinavian
countries, the number of Americans staying in Stockholm hotels was
up 10 percent in the first three months of the year, compared to
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   At one of Stockholm's top attractions, the Vasa, a sunken
warship museum, officials said the first wave of summer visitors
arrived Wednesday on a cruise ship.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were about 1,000 American cruise passengers,'' said
museum spokeswoman Maria Andersson. ''It was the first invasion.''

<HEADLINE> China Wary on U.S. Missile Shield  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN LEICESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- China may opt to boost its nuclear arsenal or
make its warheads more accurate if the United States goes ahead
with a system to shoot down incoming missiles, Beijing's chief arms
negotiator said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed U.S. National Missile Defense ''could neutralize''
China's ''very small arsenal'' and has already prompted Russia and
China to begin discussions on ways to overcome it, said Sha Zukang,
director of arms control and disarmament at the Chinese Foreign
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   The missile shield ''will have a serious effect and therefore it
could affect China's security,'' Sha said in a telephone interview.
''I have been told that we could have a series of options. One of
the options can be maybe to increase the number of our warheads.''
</P>
<P>
   Other options could be improving the accuracy of Chinese
warheads or considering other countermeasures to overcome the
missile shield, Sha said.
</P>
<P>
   Sha said no decision has been taken yet. He stressed that China
does not want to spend precious resources on countering the
proposed system, which the Pentagon wants to have operating by
2005.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those are the last things we want to do. China is a developing
country. We have still millions of people living under the poverty
line,'' Sha said. ''That's why we are strongly advising the
Americans not to go ahead with this program. It's not in their
interest. It's certainly not in China's interest. It's not in
anybody's interest.''
</P>
<P>
   The shield, if it works, would fire interceptor rockets at
incoming missiles. President Clinton may decide as early as this
summer whether to give it a green light. Washington says the shield
is designed to shoot down a small number of missiles fired from
''rogue'' nations such as North Korea, which is developing
long-range ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Sha laughed when reminded of these U.S. assurances, saying they
were not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have assured us it is not directed at China. For that we
are grateful, we are happy. But China cannot base its security on
assurances only,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States proceeds, ''we cannot sit on our hands,
watching our interests compromised, security interests compromised.
Impossible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sha said experts from China and Russia, which also is strongly
opposed to the system, ''are working together, consulting with each
other how to confront that situation.'' He gave no details.
</P>
<P>
   Sha's comments went further in their detail than previous
Chinese statements, which have mainly warned that a missile shield
could spark a costly, destabilizing arms race. China has also
warned against including Taiwan, which Beijing regards as its
territory, under a proposed regional missile shield in East Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Including Taiwan in such a system would gravely violate Chinese
sovereignty and ''surely meet with strong opposition from the
Chinese people,'' Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue told
reporters Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   On a separate issue, Zhang also voiced opposition to a proposed
U.S. watchdog commission to monitor human rights in China. The
proposal is part of efforts to win support in Congress for
legislation to grant China permanent normal trade relations with
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang urged passage of the trade bill without conditions,
''otherwise the business interests of the United States will be
hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If the U.S. side wants to establish any special commissions or
any other mechanisms to do a balancing act, I don't think that will
be of any help,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. House of Representative takes up the proposed trade
legislation May 22. Supporters suggest the proposed watchdog
commission, which could recommend sanctions against Beijing for
human rights and labor abuses, might make the trade bill more
palatable to wavering legislators.

<HEADLINE> Everglades Plan Faces Senate Doubts  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's attempts to get
Congress to pass a $7.8 billion plan to restore the Everglades ran
into powerful opposition Thursday from a fellow Republican, Sen.
John Warner of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Warner complained at a hearing that the Senate Environment and
Public Works Committee was being asked to approve projects without
completion of the necessary groundwork.
</P>
<P>
   Further, Warner contended that the amount of money allocated in
the plan ''is quite significant in contrast to what I've been able
to achieve for the Chesapeake Bay.''
</P>
<P>
   Countered Bush: ''This is a federally created problem. The mess
that has been created was created by well-intended engineers.''
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, neither Bush nor other lawmakers indicated
any concern that Warner's objections signaled a battle to come.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's natural these things are going to be raised by members
representing their states,'' said Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, saying he had met a day earlier with Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., declared, ''I think we're going to get
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee chairman, GOP Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire,
said passing an Everglades restoration bill was his ''top priority
for the committee this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's plan seeks to save the one-time
''River of Grass'' which stretches more than 100 miles across South
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, as governments tried to guard against flooding
and ensure adequate water supplies, much-needed water was diverted
from the Everglades. As a result, there is not enough water for the
environment, causing disastrous effects for an ecosystem once
filled with panthers, alligators and flocks of birds.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal aims to capture fresh water and deliver it when and
where it is needed most in the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   It would eliminate some 240 miles of levies and canals as well
as construct aboveground reservoirs, underground aquifers and
develop new wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government would have to come up with an estimated
$200 million a year for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Bush on Tuesday will sign into law Florida's contribution of $2
billion over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''No other state has made such a substantial financial
commitment to a project yet to be authorized by the federal
government,'' Bush said, adding that he wants to see language added
to create an ''equal partnership'' with the federal government,
rather than a ''master/servant'' arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is S. 2437.

<HEADLINE> South Africa Cautious on AIDS Drugs  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- South Africa welcomed an offer by
five major drug companies Thursday to cut the price of HIV/AIDS
treatments -- but not if it means giving up the right to seek out
cheaper, generic alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   The government has long battled pharmaceutical companies over
plans to import generic versions of drugs for which companies have
patents. An estimated 10 percent of South Africans are infected
with HIV or AIDS, and the government says it cannot afford to
provide drugs at current prices.
</P>
<P>
   When the three European and two U.S. companies announced
Thursday they would work with governments to reduce prices, South
Africa was cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this offer is attached to a condition that governments like
South Africa should not pursue generic substitution, parallel
importing and compulsory licensing, then it is not genuine and
unacceptable,'' said Health Ministry spokeswoman Patricia Lambert.
</P>
<P>
   The companies made no mention of conditions in their statements.
</P>
<P>
   Mirryena Deeb, chief executive of the South African
Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, said she was unaware of a
link between the offer and patent protection, but added that the
pharmaceutical companies had stressed the need for their
intellectual property rights to be respected.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's announcement in Geneva involved Germany's Boehringer
Ingelheim, Bristol-Myers Squibb of New York, Roche of Switzerland,
Glaxo Wellcome in Britain, and Merck and Co. of Whitehouse Station,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   President Thabo Mbeki's office refused to comment, saying it was
awaiting further information.
</P>
<P>
   Only Glaxo Wellcome specified one reduction it would make,
saying its Combivir drug would sell at $2 per day in the countries,
instead of the $16.50 it sells for in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But even $2 a day would put the drugs far out of reach for the
vast majority of Africa's impoverished AIDS sufferers. And the
governments in sub-Saharan Africa, where nearly 70 percent of the
world's 33.6 million HIV-infected people live, do not have the
resources to subsidize the medicine to an affordable level.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came a day after President Clinton issued an
executive order saying the United States will not challenge any
intellectual property law or policy imposed by a sub-Saharan
African government that promotes access to HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals
and medical technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a step in the right direction because we bear the big
burden of the problem, and we're not being given the means to
combat the disease,'' said Dr. Sobie Mulindi, a technical adviser
to Kenya's national AIDS council. ''In addition, it's a very
complex problem that is tied to development.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mulindi said it was unclear how the executive order would be
put into effect and whether there were drug companies on the
continent capable of producing generic versions of the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Zakie Achmat, a spokesman for the HIV/AIDS Treatment Action
Campaign, which lobbies for cheaper AIDS medication, said any offer
by the drug companies had to be unconditional.

<HEADLINE> State Senate calls for renewal of 65 mph speed limit law  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A law that increased the speed limit to 65
mph on some New York highways should be renewed and expanded to
include additional stretches of roadways, the state Senate said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   If not renewed by Dec. 1, speed limits on the 1,181 miles of
highways around the state, including most of the New York State
Thruway, would revert to 55 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should act now to extend the law so that there is no
confusion among motorists or disruption of travel and commerce that
would be caused by this sunset,'' said state Sen. Caesar Trunzo,
chairman of his chamber's transportation committee and sponsor of
the renewal bill.
</P>
<P>
   The Suffolk County Republican called for extending the law for
another five years, until Dec. 1, 2005. He cited a state study
released in March which showed that fatalities dropped
significantly on highways where the speed limit was raised from 55
mph to 65 mph by a 1995 statute.
</P>
<P>
   According to the state Department of Transportation study, fatal
accidents went down by 29 percent in the three years following the
1995 hike in speed limit, compared with the last three years of the
lower limit on the same roads.
</P>
<P>
   DOT also said the injury rate in accidents on those roads
decreased by 5 percent and the total number of accidents dipped by
4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A provision on the 1995 statute required that the state perform
a safety study of the higher limit to see whether roadways were
more dangerous because of the greater speeds. There is no formal
requirement for such a study under the renewal bill, but the roads
would still be monitored regularly, an aide to Trunzo said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's GOP majority is also introducing a package of bills
that would raise the speed limit to 65 mph on additional stretches
of highways including:
</P>
<P>
   --The Catskill portion of the New York State Thruway, south of
Woodbury Plaza, Exit 16.
</P>
<P>
   --Interstate 90 from Exit 8 in Rensselaer County east to the
Thruway's Berkshire spur, and the portion of the Berkshire spur of
the Thruway mainline to Exit B-1.
</P>
<P>
   --Route 481 from Interstate 81 interchange to Fulton in Oswego
County.
</P>
<P>
   --Part of the Southern Tier Expressway from east of the Town of
Lowman in Chemung County to the Pennsylvania state line, and from
Chemung to Route 26.
</P>
<P>
   --Route 12 from the Utica city line to Alder Creek.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, the state DOT or the Thruway Authority would have
to conduct safety studies before the speed limits could be
increased.
</P>
<P>
   ''This package of bills represents a common sense way of
ensuring that traffic on our highways continues to move safely and
at the speed for which these roads are designed,'' Senate Majority
Leader Joseph Bruno said.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno spokesman John McArdle said the bill will be brought to
the Senate floor for a vote in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki also favors expanding the law, spokesman
Charles Deister said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The initial period of 65 mph limit has been successful and
safe, and we think this makes a lot of sense,'' Deister said.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Majority Leader Michael Bragman, D-Onondaga, said his
house is also interested in a renewal as well as expansion of the
speed limit law.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have an open mind as to extending the law,'' said Bragman,
who sponsored the 1995 bill in the Assembly. ''There has to be some
discussions ... as to what additional highways, if any, the law
should be extended to.''

<HEADLINE> Sharp Profits Jump on LCD Sales  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese electronics maker Sharp Corp.'s group
profit surged by more than six times for the latest fiscal year as
sales of liquid crystal displays soared.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings growth reported Thursday follows two years of
profit declines.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected sharply higher profits for Sharp as strong
demand for liquid crystal displays outstripped supply, creating
shortages and helping push prices higher.
</P>
<P>
   For the fiscal year ended March 31, Sharp's earnings rose to
28.13 billion yen, or $256.4 million, from 4.63 billion yen the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Group sales increased 6.3 percent to 1.855 trillion yen, or
$16.9 billion, from 1.746 trillion yen a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Liquid crystal display sales rose 47 percent to 346 billion yen,
or $3.15 billion, from 235.6 billion yen a year ago. Among the
products that sold well were large-sized liquid crystal displays
for game machines and smaller versions for cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
   For the current year through March 2001, Sharp forecast overall
group sales will rise 5.1 percent to 1.950 trillion yen.
</P>
<P>
   The company predicted sales of electronic components, including
liquid crystal displays, will increase 12 percent, helping offset
weak sales in audio equipment and home appliances.
</P>
<P>
   While conventional televisions rely on bulky vacuum tubes to
amplify electric current, much thinner liquid crystal displays use
transistors manufactured in the form of a film.
</P>
<P>
   Light passes through crystals held between plates of glass,
producing an clear full-color picture.
</P>
<P>
   The glass tube in a 19-inch television weighs about 24 pounds,
while the equivalent liquid crystal display glass weighs about 0.75
pound.

<HEADLINE> Army Backs Gen. in Sex Case Finding  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A charge by the Army's highest-ranking woman
that she was sexually harassed by another general has been
substantiated by Army investigators, senior defense officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The finding, in support of an allegation by Lt. Gen. Claudia J.
Kennedy against Army Maj. Gen. Larry G. Smith, will be reviewed by
the Army's vice chief of staff, Gen. John Keane, who will determine
whether to take disciplinary action against Smith. Keane also could
ask the investigators to look further into the incident, which
happened in 1996, and resubmit their report, officials familiar
with the case said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials would discuss the matter only on condition of
anonymity, reflecting the sensitivity of the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The Army has refused to comment publicly -- even to confirm
Kennedy made an allegation or that Smith is the accused.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Army will not comment on stories which speculate about
administrative investigations,'' Maj. Gen. John G. Meyer, the
Army's chief of public information, said Thursday.
''Inspector-general investigative procedures are designed to
encourage candor and protect the individual privacy of all
parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Bacon, spokesman for Defense Secretary William Cohen,
also declined to comment, saying it was a matter for the Army.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post reported Thursday that Smith probably will
receive a reprimand and be forced to retire if, as expected, the
Army inspector general's findings are accepted by Keane. Smith will
be provided a copy of the findings and be given time to offer
contrary evidence, officials said today.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter's phone call to the office of Smith's military
lawyer, Army Lt. Col. Robert Teetsel, was not returned.
</P>
<P>
   The exact behavior of which Smith is accused has not been made
clear. The Post reported that the inspector general found that
Smith tried to kiss Kennedy, and that Army officials do not view
this as actionable under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who is married, was announced last August as the next
deputy inspector general of the Army, a position in which he would
be responsible for overseeing investigations of the kind of
behavior he is accused of. His status had been on official ''hold''
since last November, and he is assigned to the Army's Materiel
Command in Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy reportedly went to the Army inspector general with her
complaint about Smith after the announcement that he was being
promoted. The Post reported that Kennedy had hoped to save the Army
embarrassment by pursuing the matter discreetly.
</P>
<P>
   Since the case became public in March, neither Kennedy nor Smith
has been willing to discuss it publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Army officials said today that Kennedy had no comment on news
reports of the inspector general's findings.
</P>
<P>
   The Post said investigators found that while Kennedy did not
make a formal complaint of sexual harassment at the time of the
incident, she described it to friends and colleagues soon after it
occurred. Investigators found the supporting accounts by Kennedy's
friends and colleagues to be persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, the Army's deputy chief of staff for intelligence, is
due to retire in June.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Barak Vows Lebanon Pullout  </HEADLINE>
By DINA KRAFT
<TEXT>
<P>
   METULLA, Israel (AP) -- Israel will pull its soldiers out of
Lebanon by July despite the risks, Prime Minister Ehud Barak said
Thursday, responding to a demonstration by villagers who charged
that Barak is gambling with their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Barak toured the regional army command post near the border as
residents of this century-old village, fearing a withdrawal will
bring cross-border attacks by guerrillas, briefly blocked work on a
new border fence to run near their houses.
</P>
<P>
   ''Risks are involved in this,'' admitted Barak, predicting ''an
exchange of blows'' with Hezbollah guerrillas during the withdrawal
''and for some time after.'' He defended his decision to pull his
soldiers out of a border strip Israel has patrolled for 15 years,
ending what he called a ''longtime tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak's prestige is at stake. After he missed a peacemaking
target with Syria, and talks with the Palestinians show little
progress, the Lebanon withdrawal is seen as a test of his ability
to carry out promises that contributed to his landslide election
victory last year.
</P>
<P>
   Barak pledged to pull Israeli forces out of Lebanon by July 7.
He was hoping to coordinate the withdrawal with Syria, the main
power in Lebanon, but talks broke down in January.
</P>
<P>
   Now Barak is working with the United Nations, which has pledged
to increase the size of UNIFIL, a peace force patrolling the border
area since 1978. The United Nations demands that Israel pull back
to a 1923 border, bringing the fence to the edge of several
villages, including Metulla.
</P>
<P>
   Worried villagers closed access roads for three hours Thursday,
stopping work on the new border fence. They attached signs to
silent bulldozers, reading, ''We are not Barak's guinea pigs'' and
''We are not the flak jacket of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel set up its self-proclaimed security zone inside south
Lebanon as it withdrew its forces following a full-scale invasion
in 1982, aimed at driving Palestinian guerrillas out of the
country. But the continued Israeli presence spawned Hezbollah, a
Lebanese guerrilla group sponsored by Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Despite military casualties in the guerrilla war, villagers
emphasize that the ''security zone'' has fulfilled its main
objective, keeping guerrillas out of their houses. After the
demonstration, workers resumed construction of the new fence near
the village, pounding posts into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Military intelligence has warned that Hezbollah may attack
Israeli forces as they withdraw, to show that they drove the
Israelis out.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and others admit they do not know if Hezbollah will also
try to attack the villages after the withdrawal. Barak observed
that Israel's problems are ''not because we are leaving Lebanon,
but because we are in Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak warned again that Israel would respond harshly to
continued attacks. Last Thursday Israeli warplanes attacked two
Lebanese electric power stations, a highway and a Hezbollah
ammunition dump after Hezbollah fired rockets at border villages.

<HEADLINE> Bobby Brown Is Back in Jail  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Singer Bobby Brown was back in a
Florida jail Thursday after being arrested by customs agents in New
Jersey on an outstanding warrant accusing him of violating
probation in a drunken-driving case.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who has a home in Mendham, N.J., with wife Whitney
Houston, was arrested Wednesday at the Newark, N.J., airport after
arriving from the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   The warrant was put out last June, when Brown's probation
officer reported that cocaine showed up in a urine test, that Brown
refused to take another test and that he didn't return from a trip
to Beverly Hills, Calif., on time.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is scheduled to appear in Circuit Court on May 22.
</P>
<P>
   The original case developed after Brown smashed his wife's
sports car into a condominium sign.

<HEADLINE> University student assembly urges campus store to rent porn  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BINGHAMTON, N.Y. (AP) -- Bring on the skin, say student leaders
at Binghamton State University who want the campus video store to
stock pornographic movies to rent.
</P>
<P>
   The university's Student Assembly voted 23-7 on a resolution
urging Take One Video to begin renting porn titles. The store is
located in the student union building.
</P>
<P>
   University officials will consider the resolution over the
summer, said university spokeswoman Katie Ellis. She said no public
money is used for the store located in the student union. The store
makes only enough from rentals of its 860 videos to cover the cost
of student salaries, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am strongly opposed to censorship or actions that would
limit student access to any kind of materials,'' said university
President Lois B. DeFleur. ''However, I do not feel the university
is obligated to make available all kinds of materials to students,
and if they are inclined to view this type of video, it is
available in the local area.''
</P>
<P>
   Acting on the resolution, Adam Weissberger, executive vice
president of the Student Association, sent a letter to University
Union Director James Koval asking that porn titles be put on the
shelves.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not trying to say that pornography is completely moral.
There are some very good arguments that can be made against the
industry. However, that does not change the fact that the Assembly
voted overwhelmingly to stock these kinds of movies,'' Weissberger
wrote in his letter.
</P>
<P>
   Student Assembly member Dave Berkowitz, who sponsored the
resolution, said although the resolution was written
tongue-in-cheek -- ending with the request that Assembly members and
other students attach their favorite porn titles -- the intent is
serious.
</P>
<P>
   While he doesn't care for pornography, he said students should
have the right to rent the videos.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly members, in passing the resolution, merely reflected
the wishes of their constituents, Weissberger said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If people don't like this type of film, they don't have to
rent them,'' said Weissberger.
</P>
<P>
   The assembly's action drew a mixed reaction on the campus.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Toner called pornographic movies ''very degrading'' and
said they should not be available on campus. X-rated videos are not
available on for rent at State University of New York campuses in
Buffalo, Plattsburgh, Albany or Cortland.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will just give the school a bad name and cause a lot of
controversy,'' said Toner, a 19-year-old freshman.
</P>
<P>
   SUNY officials in Albany did not return phone calls seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, a sex-themed conference at New Paltz that
included explicit discussions of sex toys and workshops on
sadomasochism became a flash point of controversy.

<HEADLINE> Cell Phones Said Not Unhealthy  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Children should be discouraged from using cellular
telephones for nonessential calls, a government advisory panel said
Thursday, recommending that cell phones carry labels disclosing the
amount of radiation they generate.
</P>
<P>
   Although the panel concluded there is no evidence cell phones
cause harm, it said it could not rule out the possibility that
future research could discover long-term use may be harmful.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to give the public the evidence and let the public
make up their own minds about how to go forward with the use of
cellular phones,'' said the panel's chairman, Sir William Stewart,
a former chief scientific adviser to the government.
</P>
<P>
   In response to public concern over potential harm to children,
the scientists advised parents to tell their children to use cell
phones only for essential calls and said the industry should
refrain from targeting children in marketing campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   It said the old and the sick may also be particularly vulnerable
because their resistance is lower.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't really say there's any risk for children, the young,
the elderly, the sick or the infirm,'' said panel member Colin
Blakemore, a brain development expert from Oxford University.
</P>
<P>
   But if it later emerges that cellular phones cause harm,
children may be more vulnerable because their nervous systems are
still developing, they have thinner skulls and smaller heads, and
they would have a longer liftetime exposure to the radiation, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   International guidelines governing the amount of radiation
cellular phones can emit already include a substantial extra margin
of safety to account for the special concerns of children, the
elderly and other vulnerable populations, said panel member Dr.
Michael Repacholi, who heads the World Health Organization's
program on electromagnetic fields.
</P>
<P>
   The panel said a few preliminary studies have suggested
radiation may cause subtle biological changes in the brain, but
that does not mean health necessarily would be affected.
</P>
<P>
   The radio waves transmitted by cellular phones mostly come from
the antenna. Heat in the handset is not related to radiation, but
to the battery depleting with use.
</P>
<P>
   Safety is judged partly by something called ''specific energy
absorption rate,'' or SAR. It refers to the rate at which the
microwaves are absorbed by tissue in the head of the person using
the phone and is measured in watts per kilogram of tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Most countries use the international guidelines governing the
SAR values, which are set at 2 watts per 2.2 pounds of tissue. That
has a built-in extra margin for those more susceptible to
radiation, the World Health Organization says. The United States
uses 1.6 watts per 2.2 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Not all cellular phones have the same rate, and the value partly
depends on the design of the handset.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists recommended that the radiowave absorption rate be
quoted on the packaging, on the phone itself, in the handset's
on-screen menu and on the Internet so consumers can compare rates.
</P>
<P>
   Leaflets explaining the significance of the numbers, as well as
the health evidence so far, should be sent to every household in
the nation, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also recommended stricter controls on the location of
cellular phone masts.
</P>
<P>
   The government said it would act immediately on several of the
recommendations, and consider others.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government will expect SAR measurements to be displayed at
all points of sale and with each cellular phone and on the World
Wide Web,'' the Department of Health said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The department also announced plans to beef up its research
program.
</P>
<P>
   The cellular phone industry praised the report and said it would
contribute to a fund for more research and make information on
radiation absorption rates readily available to consumers.

<HEADLINE> New Cow Disease Outbreak Hits Japan  </HEADLINE>
By ERIC PRIDEAUX
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Hours after authorities in southern Japan declared
the outbreak of foot-and-mouth cattle disease over, the government
said Thursday that hundreds of possibly sick cows in the north
would be slaughtered.
</P>
<P>
   Two calves at a farm in Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost island,
were confirmed as carrying the highly contagious virus, said
Agriculture Ministry official Yoshio Morinaga.
</P>
<P>
   Foot-and-mouth disease is highly communicable and can kill
carrier animals and ruin entire beef and milk-cow herds. But unlike
mad cow disease, which is believed to cause a brain-wasting ailment
in humans, it cannot be passed on to people.
</P>
<P>
   The slaughtering of more than 700 cows at the farm in the town
of Hombetsu, 400 miles north of Tokyo, all suspected of carrying
the disease, will begin Friday, Morinaga said.
</P>
<P>
   The animals will be buried after they are killed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Movement of cattle within a six-mile radius of the farm will be
restricted, and vehicles and other equipment will be disinfected,
the ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, authorities in Miyazaki state, where the
deadly animal disease was first reported on March 25, had declared
the outbreak over and cattle herds safe.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was made late Wednesday after blood tests on 21,781
cattle in the prefecture found that none of them showed symptoms of
the disease, said Miyazaki livestock official Naohiro Inoue.
</P>
<P>
   Since the March outbreak, 35 cattle showing signs of the disease
at three farms in Miyazaki were slaughtered.
</P>
<P>
   In tests beginning April 21, cows at 405 farms across Japan were
screened for the virus. The two calves believed to be infected
showed up in those tests, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, South Korea said it would soon reopen most of its
livestock markets as foot-and-mouth disease there has stopped
spreading.
</P>
<P>
   Japan stiffened a ban on beef, pork and livestock from South
Korea, where about 2,200 cattle and pigs have been slaughtered
since the disease broke out there around March 20.
</P>
<P>
   Outbreaks in Japan and South Korea have led governments
throughout Asia to ban imports of beef and pork from those nations.
Japan's last case of foot-and-mouth disease was in 1908.

<HEADLINE> CIA Secret War Vets Not Recognized  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It has been a quarter century since they
fought in the CIA's secret war and a decade since they were told
they might get U.S. citizenship in return.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Hmong and Laotian veterans of the Vietnam War came
to Capitol Hill to plead again. They again found a delay in
recognition of their service.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will ask again and again -- and again and again and again,''
said Reagan Ngamvilay, a 10-year veteran who sought refuge in
America in 1979 and now lives in Mobile, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,500 Hmong tribesmen and other Laotians in
camouflaged field uniforms quietly filed past the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial early Thursday, saluting as they walked.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the granite wall carrying names of 58,000 U.S. dead, the
veterans' leaders laid a wreath of white daisies to honor the
35,000 Laotians they say died in the war.
</P>
<P>
   Followed by several hundred women and children in traditional
Hmong costume, they walked to Capitol Hill to press for passage of
legislation first proposed in 1990 to ease citizenship requirements
for them.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time they got there, the legislation had been set
aside -- at least until next week. There was disagreement on details
of the bill and the Senate Judiciary Committee did not have enough
members present to take a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1990, lawmakers have talked about waiving or easing
language requirements because some Hmong, who are an ethnic group
in Laos, have had great trouble learning English for the
citizenship test.
</P>
<P>
   The House has passed a version, but the Senate has stalled on
the question of who should verify the Laotians' service because
government officials said they kept no records on members of the
force they did not even officially acknowledge for years.
</P>
<P>
   Some legislators worry that many who did not serve would be able
to take advantage of the eased language requirements. Also, there
is disagreement on how many would be eligible; some estimate there
are 60,000 Laotian veterans living in America, others say the
number is actually 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA relied on the Hmong in the 1960s and 1970s as proxy
fighters against Laotian communists and their North Vietnamese
allies. They gathered intelligence, rescued downed Americans, and
guarded radar sites on Hmong village mountains to guide American
strike planes. They also battled the Viet Cong.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's ceremonies marked the fifth time Laotian vets have
traveled to Washington at this time in May to press for the bill
and mark the 25th anniversary of their exodus from Laos when the
war ended.
</P>
<P>
   ''Twenty-five years ... it is too long,'' said Vang Pao, a
70-year-old former general who came to the United States and farmed
in Montana before moving to Orange County, Calif. ''But America did
not let its people know what we did -- and many in Congress didn't
know, so it took time for us to educate them.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to be patient,'' he said, ''and we have to educate the
Senate as well as we did the House.''

<HEADLINE> Medicine Journal Names New Editor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALTHAM, Mass. (AP) -- The chief of pulmonary medicine at Brigham
and Women's Hospital has been named editor-in-chief of The New
England Journal of Medicine, the journal's publisher said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeffrey M. Drazen will replace Dr. Marsha Angell, who had
assumed the post Sept. 1 until a new editor was found.
</P>
<P>
   Angell had replaced Dr. Jerome P. Kassirer, who was forced to
step down in July after eight years at the helm of the journal,
published by the Massachusetts Medical Society. Kassirer disagreed
with the society's decision to use the journal's name to promote
other publications.
</P>
<P>
   Drazen has led the Pulmonary Division at Brigham and Women's
since 1989. A specialist in asthma research, he has written or
co-written 200 original research articles and 100 review articles
in medical journals since 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ''Medical journals have a vital role to play in the world,''
Drazen said in a statement. ''They are the interface between the
people who create medical knowledge -- the researchers -- and the
people who use it -- the clinicians.''
</P>
<P>
   The New England Journal, founded in 1812, is one of the world's
most prestigious medical publications.

<HEADLINE> Congress Fights Over Elderly Drugs  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans at a congressional hearing on
Thursday questioned the affordability -- for senior citizens and the
government -- of the Democrats' latest plan to add prescription drug
coverage to Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you set up a structure within which the government holds
the bag, ... at some point, the bag gets pretty heavy,'' said Rep.
Bill Thomas, chairman of the House Ways and Means health
subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare administrator Nancy-Ann DeParle, testifying for the
Clinton administration, said financing details should be resolved
through bipartisan negotiations. But she added that, ''from our
perspective one of the principles here is that this benefit must be
affordable both to beneficiaries and to the program.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are sorting out some of the same money problems as
they work on rival legislation that would help retirees with drug
costs through the private sector, Thomas acknowledged, saying
''certain concerns may be more or less common to any plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Democrats on Wednesday outlined legislation
building on President Clinton's year-old proposal to add drug
benefits to Medicare. Among changes, the Democrats added
catastrophic protection that would pay all costs for prescriptions
after a retiree spends about $3,000 out of pocket in any year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had envisioned such a feature, earmarking $35 billion
for it in his proposal, but left out specifics. So far, it's
unclear whether $35 billion would be enough.
</P>
<P>
   At Thursday's hearing, Congressional Budget Office Director Dan
Crippen said that depending on how catastrophic protection is
designed, it could potentially double the price tag Clinton has put
on his basic coverage plan -- $160 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will likely be quite expensive,'' said Crippen.
</P>
<P>
   Crippen stressed, however, that he does not have an official
estimate because Democrats have not settled final details of their
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are contemplating how to include catastrophic
protections in their legislation as well.
</P>
<P>
   DeParle said one of the decisions lawmakers will have to make is
whether part of the cost should be borne by beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a tension between providing a full catastrophic
benefit with no additional cost to beneficiaries or providing one
where the ... costs to the Medicare program are lower,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Democrats' plan, senior citizens could get basic
Medicare drug coverage for about $25 a month to start. The
government would pay half the bill for each prescription up to a
$1,000 cap. That benefit cap would gradually rise to $2,500 as the
program was phased in, along with the monthly premium retirees
would pay, which would reach $50.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, House Republicans have outlined legislation that
would have the government help finance a new kind of private
insurance providing drug coverage for retirees. Medicare would
directly subsidize the cost of enrollment for those with the lowest
incomes and the highest drug bills.
</P>
<P>
   GOP lawmakers have not yet specified the cost to beneficiaries,
but have promised to put up $40 billion from government surpluses.

<HEADLINE> Group Wants Tests of Chemicals  </HEADLINE>
By CAREN BENJAMIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A pregnant woman who spends a few hours on a
home-improvement project may unwittingly be putting her child at
risk for problems ranging from hyperactivity to autism, a group of
Boston-area doctors said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is chemicals in common household products like
solvents and pesticides. No one knows how dangerous they are to
human brain development because the government doesn't require
companies to perform such tests before bringing products to market,
the Greater Boston Physicians for Social Responsibility said in a
report.
</P>
<P>
   Tests on animals show there is cause for concern about products
ranging from glue to flea collars to nail polish, said the report
by the group, an affiliate of the Nobel Peace Prize-winning
national Physicians for Social Responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston organization said the federal government should start
requiring tests to ensure chemicals do not harm human brain
development.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly the solution is not simply educating the public to
walk through a minefield,'' said Dr. Jill Stein, an instructor in
adolescent medicine at Harvard Medical School and one of the
report's authors.
</P>
<P>
   Chemical makers say they already are working with the
Environmental Protection Agency to develop a testing program
focused on children.
</P>
<P>
   ''These research and testing initiatives, costing hundreds of
millions of dollars, represent a comprehensive and focused effort
to provide government, industry and parents and other caregivers
information to determine what actions may be necessary to further
ensure the health and safety of children we are all responsible for
protecting,'' said Frank Rathbun, spokesman for the Chemical
Manufacturers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Rathbun also faulted the report's findings.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have made a series of assertions about the health effects
of various compounds, but have provided no data on the levels of
exposure that would produce such effects,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The physicians stressed such data is not available for most
chemicals, so it would be better to hold off on distribution until
the products are proven to be safe.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, chemicals must be tested for their affects on the
physical structure of the brain of laboratory animals before they
can be sold, said Dr. Ted Schettler, one of the report's authors.
The tests do not, however, measure how the brain works after being
exposed to the chemical, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we think of as safe in our early studies of these
chemicals often turns out to be wrong,'' Schettler said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the approximately 15,000 commonly sold chemicals on the
market, only 12 have been tested specifically for their effects on
brain development, according to report co-author David Wallinga,
senior scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA currently is considering restricting use or dosage of
the pesticides Dursban and Lorsban because of concerns about the
products' effects on children. Both are used in a range of products
from lawn insecticides to flea collars for pets.

<HEADLINE> President Seeks Equal Pay for Women  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton appealed for new federal
money to help narrow the wage gap for women in the burgeoning high
technology field on Thursday, saying equal pay is not a political
issue anywhere but Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants Congress to approve a $20 million program at the
National Science Foundation to help advance the careers of women
scientists and engineers -- two highly paid fields where women are
underrepresented.
</P>
<P>
   He is also asking Congress to fund a $27 million program to
attack the wage inequality problem in general. Both requests are
part of Clinton's budget for 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a political or a partisan issue anywhere else,''
Clinton said during a White House commemoration of Equal Pay Day,
the theoretical point in the year when women and better-paid men
begin earning equal pay for equal work.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whether we do something or not, and whether what we do is
meaningful or is not a political or a partisan issue in America,
and it shouldn't be here.''
</P>
<P>
   House Education and the Workforce Committee Chairman Rep. Bill
Goodling said Clinton is repackaging old ideas and requests.
</P>
<P>
   ''President Clinton's comments today imply that equal pay and
related issues are not a high priority for the 106th Congress,''
said Goodling, R-Pa. ''Obviously, the president hasn't paid close
attention,'' to GOP ideas, Goodling said.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, women earn about 75 percent as much as equally
qualified men, according to a variety of government and independent
studies. The results are about the same for the information
technology industry, even though the industry has experienced a
dramatic growth in jobs and wealth.
</P>
<P>
   A White House economic report released Thursday singled out the
high-technology industry as an area where there are too few women
earning too small a share of the potential wages.

   ''Fewer than one in three of these high-tech, high-wage jobs are
women,'' Clinton said. Clinton called the disparity ''another

   Information technology work, which includes computer
programming, design and engineering, is growing at a furious pace.
Since 1983, employment in the industry grew 81 percent, according
to the White House report, while job growth in the general economy
was 32 percent.

<P>
   Women benefit from the overall affluence of the industry --
making salaries nearly 50 percent above women in the wider work
force, the White House report found.
</P>
<P>
   ''However, an important gender employment gap exists in the IT
occupations,'' said the report from the White House Council of
Economic Advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Women make up only 29 percent of the five basic information
technology job categories studied in the report, although they are
47 percent of the work force at large, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Further, women are scarcest in the high-tech jobs that pay the
most, the report found. For example, only 10 percent of electrical
engineers are women, the report found.
</P>
<P>
   While 20 percent of male high-tech workers earn $69,740 or more,
only 7 percent of female workers earn that much, the report found.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Health Care Battle Begins  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- In Canada's cherished ''free for all'' Medicare
system, which promises universal access to state-funded health
care, ''private'' was long considered a dirty word.
</P>
<P>
   That could be changing with Alberta province's passage Wednesday
of a law allowing private clinics to perform some major surgery and
provide other services generally restricted to public hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Such clinics, which are smaller facilities that lack the
diagnostic equipment and emergency rooms of hospitals, now offer
only outpatient procedures and other minor treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, private clinics would receive state money to
perform operations -- such as hip- and knee-replacements -- that
require overnight stays.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to ease the burden on the state-funded health
system, which now forces patients to wait months for some elective
surgeries, such as cataract procedures and hip replacements.
Wealthy Canadians often choose to travel to the United States to
pay for such operations instead of waiting in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents contend, however, that the law eventually could lead
to private clinics devising ways to charge for services covered by
Medicare, such as allowing patients to pay for an insured service
to get treated more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you believe the (Alberta) government, this will add
capacity and shorten waiting lists,'' said Michael Decter, head of
the Canadian Institute for Health Information and a former Ontario
deputy health minister. ''If you believe the opponents, then it
won't shorten waiting lists and will charge for previously covered
services.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure touches on one of the most sensitive issues in a
country that embraces the 28-year-old Medicare system as a
reflection of the national social conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters shouting ''Kill the Bill!'' converged on the Alberta
legislature in the weeks leading up to its final approval, with two
demonstrators forcibly removed from the chamber Wednesday night for
disrupting the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Health Minister Allen Rock immediately warned Alberta
the government would crack down on any violations of the Canada
Health Act.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in parliament on Thursday, Rock said private clinics
permitted to perform expanded surgical procedures under the new law
would be considered hospitals as defined by the Health Act and
therefore obliged to offer Medicare-covered services for free.
</P>
<P>
   He also announced the budget for hiring staff to enforce the
federal law would be more than doubled to $2.7 million. Violators
can have federal health care funds withheld.
</P>
<P>
   According to Decter, the changes introduced by the law are less
significant than the public outcry. The measure specifically
forbids private hospitals, but authorizes the Alberta health
minister to contract out minor and non-emergency surgical work
covered by Medicare to private clinics, consistent with the Canada
Health Act.
</P>
<P>
   It also sets fines of $6,800 for a first offense and $13,600 for
a second offense for clinics that charge for services covered by
Medicare, allow paying patients to jump the waiting list or sell
additional services not covered by Medicare without properly
disclosing options.
</P>
<P>
   Decter said the new law, when enacted as expected later this
year, could lead to quicker and simpler procedures going to private
clinics while more complex, costly operations remain at public
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The risk, he said, is ''if you can make more money as a surgeon
doing a lot of procedures in a clinic, because they're easier, then
you may get the best surgeons gravitating toward the clinics.''
</P>
<P>
   Such profit-driven thinking is what scares opponents of the
bill. Dr. Walley J. Temple of the Tom Baker Cancer Center in
Calgary said focusing on profits harmed the ability to care for
patients.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent speech, Temple said overseas colleagues were ''in
awe'' of Canada's public health care system, which he called ''a
veritable treasure'' because it made patient care instead of
financial incentive the primary focus.
</P>
<P>
   ''For-profit care has very little to do with care and very much
to do with profit,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Aid Delays Said Have Costs  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A top State Department official said Wednesday
delays by Congress in approving aid money for Colombia have forced
the United States to curtail helicopter training of Colombian
pilots and spraying operations against illicit narcotics plants.
</P>
<P>
   ''There appear to be some members who lack understanding of the
urgency of the situation and the costs of this delay,'' Under
Secretary of State Thomas Pickering said.
</P>
<P>
   Pickering spoke with reporters as he prepared to leave for
Colombia on Thursday for talks with President Andres Pastrana and
other officials about the joint efforts of the two countries to
curb narcotics trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Appropriations Committee on Thursday cut the
administration's new money request for Colombia from $1.3 billion
to $1.1 billion. In addition, Senate rules will require the
approval of 60 votes for the package to be approved.
</P>
<P>
   Pickering called the adoption of the rule ''a very serious
mistake. Our hope is that it will not influence the outcome of this
very important legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Each day and week of delay spells higher costs at the end of
the day, costs in human terms in our own country, costs in human
terms in Colombia, additional costs for getting the process
reversed,'' Pickering said.
</P>
<P>
   The Appropriations Committee deleted the administration's
request for 33 Blackhawk helicopters for the counter-drug fight.
Pickering noted that the House version fully funds the Blackhawks,
and he expressed hope that the differences can be worked out to the
administration's satisfaction by House-Senate conferees.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Blackhawks are needed in Colombia because it
provides better armor, flies faster and has longer ranger than Huey
helicopters, which also are part of the administration's request.
</P>
<P>
   The reluctance of the committee to embrace the full
administration request reflects the concern of some lawmakers that
that the United States might become involved in Colombia's civil
war. Others believe that attempts at stopping narcotics flow are
doomed to fail and that U.S. resources should be earmarked for
treatment programs for people suffering from drug addiction.

<HEADLINE> Hungary Textbooks Call Jews Enemies  </HEADLINE>
By EVA KEKES
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) -- Hungarian school textbooks fail to
describe in detail the horrors of the Holocaust, and some refer to
Jews as ''murderers of Christ'' and ''enemies of Germans,'' a new
study says.
</P>
<P>
   ''We found the Jews in two contexts, once in ancient times, and
then, with a big leap, in the 20th century,'' study author Monika
Kovacs said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The study reviewed 50 textbooks for teaching history, geography
and literature published in 1997 and 1998. It is part of a series
prepared for the Central and Eastern European Curriculum Review
Project of the New York-based American Jewish Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that in the history of ancient times, Jews are
almost exclusively mentioned as ''the murderers of Christ.'' From
the Middle Ages to the 19th century, references to Jews are nearly
entirely missing from textbooks, before they reappear in sections
on 20th century history.
</P>
<P>
   The Holocaust is discussed in every textbook but not in
sufficient detail, said Kovacs, an assistant professor in social
and educational psychology at Budapest's Eotvos Lorand University.
She is also chair of the Hannah Arendt Association, which promotes
Holocaust education among Hungarian teachers.
</P>
<P>
   One textbook had only one paragraph on the Holocaust, referring
to it as ''part of World War II,' and the Jews are referred to as
'enemies of the Germans','' Kovacs said.
</P>
<P>
   Another book frequently refers to Jews as ''the capitalists of
Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   The AJC's first three reports dealt with textbooks in Poland,
the Czech Republic and Slovakia, and similar ones are planned for
Ukraine, Russia, Croatia and Lithuania.
</P>
<P>
   Similar findings were reported in the other countries surveyed.
In Slovakia, one textbook was found to be openly anti-Semitic and
was withdrawn as a result of AJC's intervention.
</P>
<P>
   There are over 100,000 Jews currently living in Hungary, down
from 1 million before the war. More than 600,000 Hungarian Jews
perished in the Holocaust.

<HEADLINE> Group Wants Tests of Some Chemicals  </HEADLINE>
By CAREN BENJAMIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A pregnant woman who spends a few hours on a
home-improvement project may unwittingly be putting her child at
risk for problems ranging from hyperactivity to autism, a group of
Boston-area doctors said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is chemicals in common household products like
solvents and pesticides. No one knows how dangerous they are to
human brain development because the government doesn't require
companies to perform such tests before bringing products to market,
the Greater Boston Physicians for Social Responsibility said in a
report.
</P>
<P>
   Tests on animals show there is cause for concern about products
ranging from glue to flea collars to nail polish, said the report
by the group, an affiliate of the Nobel Peace Prize-winning
national Physicians for Social Responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston organization said the federal government should start
requiring tests to ensure chemicals do not harm human brain
development.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly the solution is not simply educating the public to
walk through a minefield,'' said Dr. Jill Stein, an instructor in
adolescent medicine at Harvard Medical School and one of the
report's authors.
</P>
<P>
   Chemical makers say they already are working with the
Environmental Protection Agency to develop a testing program
focused on children.
</P>
<P>
   ''These research and testing initiatives, costing hundreds of
millions of dollars, represent a comprehensive and focused effort
to provide government, industry and parents and other caregivers
information to determine what actions may be necessary to further
ensure the health and safety of children we are all responsible for
protecting,'' said Frank Rathbun, spokesman for the Chemical
Manufacturers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Rathbun also faulted the report's findings.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have made a series of assertions about the health effects
of various compounds, but have provided no data on the levels of
exposure that would produce such effects,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The physicians stressed such data is not available for most
chemicals, so it would be better to hold off on distribution until
the products are proven to be safe.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, chemicals must be tested for their affects on the
physical structure of the brain of laboratory animals before they
can be sold, said Dr. Ted Schettler, one of the report's authors.
The tests do not, however, measure how the brain works after being
exposed to the chemical, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we think of as safe in our early studies of these
chemicals often turns out to be wrong,'' Schettler said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the approximately 15,000 commonly sold chemicals on the
market, only 12 have been tested specifically for their effects on
brain development, according to report co-author David Wallinga,
senior scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA currently is considering restricting use or dosage of
the pesticides Dursban and Lorsban because of concerns about the
products' effects on children. Both are used in a range of products
from lawn insecticides to flea collars for pets.

<HEADLINE> Letter Carriers Food Collection Set  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mail carriers across the country will conduct
their annual ''Stamp Out Hunger'' food drive Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Carriers in 10,000 communities are asking residents to set out
nonperishable food items for them to collect and distribute, the
National Association of Letter Carriers said.
</P>
<P>
   The items collected go to food banks and homeless shelters in
the community where they are donated.
</P>
<P>
   ''Donations are especially needed now to stock food pantries for
the summer months when millions of children are without the
nutritional benefits of their school lunch programs,'' union
president Vince Sombrotto said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year carriers collected 58.4 million pounds of food for
community food banks.
</P>
<P>
   To assist in this year's drive, 95 million postcard flyers,
sponsored by the Campbell Soup Company and the Priority Mail
Division of the U.S. Postal Service, have been delivered to
residents in participating cities to encourage donations.
</P>
<P>
   While the carriers are collecting the food left by mailboxes in
most areas, in New York City and Chicago residents are being asked
to take their donations to their local post office.

   Weather Affects Retail Sales

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dreary weather, stock market volatility and
rising interest rates helped pull Americans back from their
free-spending ways in April, making retail sales fall for the first
time since August 1998. But economists said the
weaker-than-expected sales won't stop the Federal Reserve from
boosting interest rates again next week. Sales at retail stores

$266 billion following a brisk 0.5 percent increase in March, the
Commerce Department said today.

   TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese electronics maker Sharp Corp.'s group
profit surged by more than six times for the latest fiscal year as
sales of liquid crystal displays soared. The earnings growth
reported today follows two years of profit declines. Strong demand
for liquid crystal displays outstripped supply, creating shortages
and helping push prices higher. For the fiscal year ended March 31,
Sharp's earnings rose to 28.13 billion yen, or $256.4 million, from
4.63 billion yen the previous year. Demand for game machines and
cellular phones spurred sales of LCDs.

<HEADLINE> Bill Backs Military Recruiters  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Public high schools would have to give
military recruiters the same access they give colleges and
private-sector representatives under a provision attached to a $310
billion defense bill headed for Senate action.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors of the measure expressed alarm at what they said was an
increasing number of high schools that are denying access to
military recruiters just as the services are struggling to meet
their recruitment goals. High schools barred such recruiters more
than 19,000 times last year, said the Senate Armed Services
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very common,'' said Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., chairman
of the Armed Services personnel subcommittee. ''Lack of access to
high school students is the biggest problem faced by military
recruiters.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson's measure would make it illegal for public high
schools to discriminate against military recruiters if those high
schools allow private-sector and college representatives on campus.
The only way to keep the military out would be if the local school
board took a specific vote to deny them access to the school.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would be extremely surprised if a school board wants to
publicly vote to maintain a policy that is biased against the very
institutions that guarantee America's freedom,'' Hutchinson said.
</P>
<P>
   As originally proposed, the legislation would have denied
federal education funds to schools that violate the proposed law.
However, Senate Democrats objected and that was removed, so the
legislation the Senate Armed Services Committee approved this week
has no enforcement mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   The provision was included in a bill authorizing Defense
Department programs for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Catherine Abbott, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said the
military services have been ''working very hard to get access to
the high schools'' but that it is often difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 2,000 public high schools have policies that bar
military recruiters from one or more of the services, she said.
</P>
<P>
   With year after year of declines in military recruitments --
blamed in part on the strong economy and the availability of
higher-paying private sector jobs -- the military has sweetened its
enlistment packages.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, enlistment bonuses of $5,000 or more are offered.
The Pentagon also has a program under which it will help recruits
pay for two years of college in advance of military service.
</P>
<P>
   ''Young people deserve to know all the options available to
them,'' said Hutchinson, who said many school administrators
exhibit ''an anti-military bias.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is opposed by some education groups, including
the National School Boards Association, which believes such
decisions should be made locally, not by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe this is a local school district matter, and not
appropriate for the federal government,'' said Reggie Felton, the
association's director of federal relations. He said he was
pleased, however, that the fund cutoff provision had been dropped.
</P>
<P>
   David Griffith, director of governmental affairs for the
National Association of State Boards of Education, said the Senate
committee's vote was ''somewhat ironic'' in that the Senate has
been debating legislation in recent days ''that focused a lot on
flexibility and local control.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Congress has provided over $400 million in additional
funds over the past three years for military recruiting and
retention, last year all military services except the Marine Corps
failed to meet recruiting goals.
</P>
<P>
   Through March 2000, Pentagon figures show, the Army, Navy and
Marine Corps were on track to meet their recruitment goals for the
year, but the Air Force was meeting only 83 percent of its goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate may take up the full defense authorization bill as
early as next week. The action comes as military spending
legislation was advancing through both the House and the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation in both chambers would give the military a 3.7
percent across-the-board pay increase next year -- following a 4.8
percent increase in military pay that took effect last January.
</P>
<P>
   ''Military recruiters still have to have access to the students
to make the case for what's available,'' Hutchinson said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Armed Services Committee, last year there were
4,515 specific cases of denial of high school access to Army
recruiters, 4,364 instances of denial for the Navy; 4,884 cases of
denial for the Marine Corps; and 5,465 instances for the Air Force.

<HEADLINE> Ford To Restructure at Dagenham  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN HYDE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Ford Motor Co., trying to cut its costs in the
tough European market, said it would announce on Friday major
changes in its operations at its Dagenham manufacturing complex in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Ford chairman William Clay Ford Jr. and CEO Jac Nasser declined
Thursday to offer specifics of the company's plans for the Dagenham
plants. But the two did say the site would remain an important part
of Ford's European business.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dagenham is going to continue forever,'' Nasser said. The plan
is ''really the rebirth of Dagenham.''
</P>
<P>
   Nasser said Ford's investments for Dagenham over the next few
years would approach $750 million dollars. But he also said Ford
would take a financial charge against earnings for its
restructuring plans.
</P>
<P>
   The future of Dagenham has been the source of speculation for
months as Ford has considered ways to improve profits at its
European division, which lost $55 million last year and $3 million
in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Ford runs an assembly plant and a diesel engine plant at
Dagenham, and employs over 6,000 people there. The assembly plant,
built in 1931, has been running far below capacity, producing
191,000 vehicles last year when it was designed to handle 278,000.
Ford builds the Ford Fiesta cars and Courier vans there, mainly for
customers in Britain and Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said in February it was cutting 1,350 jobs from the
Dagenham assembly plant, and workers feared the company would close
the assembly line altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The future of the diesel engine plant seemed more secure because
it is the only diesel engine factory Ford has and is essential to
providing diesel engines for the European market, where they are in
high demand. Nasser said the company would ''invest heavily in that
facility.''
</P>
<P>
   Nasser said the plan would be consistent with other moves Ford
has made this year, which have included ending joint manufacturing
ventures in Europe with Volkswagen and Mitsubishi. While the
strength of the British pound has driven up the cost of doing
business in Britain, Nasser said Ford's plans were based on Ford's
own production forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Nasser and Ford also said the company had talked with the
government of British Prime Minister Tony Blair and labor unions
about its plans.
</P>
<P>
   The comments came after Ford held its annual meeting for
shareholders.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Posts Strong Gains vs. Euro  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against the euro Thursday, as
European leaders chose not to intervene to help revive their
sagging currency. But the dollar fell against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at 90.06 cents,
down from 91.87 cents late Wednesday. The dollar was quoted at
108.53 Japanese yen, down from 109.39.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar soared against the euro amid broad gains in the U.S.
stock markets. A government report that showed retail sales had
slowed in April eased fears of rising inflation. The Dow Jones
industrial average rose 178 points and the Nasdaq composite index
gained 115.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, European leaders chose not to raise interest rates, a
move that might have given a boost to the ailing single European
currency.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the euro has dropped to new lows as investors
predicted that European authorities would not take an aggressive
action to stimulate the economy and make investment there
attractive. The euro is the single currency of 11 European nations
and has been trading since January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The pound sank again on Thursday, a day after the release of a
benign inflation report that dampened expectations of further
interest rate hikes in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The British pound fell to a four-year low of $1.5022, down from
$1.5115 in late trading Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar also was quoted at 1.7292 Swiss francs, up from
1.7150, and 1.4901 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4927.
</P>
<P>
   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate.
Based on Thursday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 2.1724 German
marks, up from 2.1484; 7.2860 French francs, up from 7.2055; and
2,150.69 Italian lire, up from 2,126.95.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Launches Attack Vs. Bush  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton took on the role of
political attacker Thursday, charging that George W. Bush would
pursue ''troublesome'' nuclear-arms policies as president, let
polluters regulate the environment and appoint judges bent on
repealing abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   In his toughest criticism yet of the presumed Republican
presidential nominee, Clinton also contended that Bush would bring
back budget deficits and higher interest rates by pushing big tax
cuts and Pentagon spending increases.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign shot back that Clinton was ''continuing his
transition from commander in chief into his role as campaign
manager in chief'' for Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   With Gore trailing in the polls, Clinton opened up on Bush in a
radio interview with Diane Rehm of National Public Radio. While
Clinton often has professed reluctance to be dragged into the
presidential race, he jumped in enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
   Gore increasingly is turning to surrogates for help in attacking
Bush, as some advisers fear that the vice president's own
full-throated criticisms are backfiring with voters who say they
don't like negative campaigning. Health and Human Services
Secretary Donna Shalala criticized the governor's health care plans
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''What the president is pointing out is something that Al Gore
has pointed out, other Democrats have pointed out and other
analysts have pointed out,'' said Gore spokesman Chris Lehane.
</P>
<P>
   Singling out national security policies, Clinton noted Bush's
opposition to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which the Senate
defeated last year.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Clinton said Bush ''wants to build a much bigger
missile defense system than the evidence warrants right now -- it
may support it later -- no matter what the consequences are to the
efforts we're making to reduce the nuclear weapons threat around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''So I think that that gives me some pause,'' the president
said. ''I think that's troublesome. Because it could cause the
country a lot of trouble in the next four or five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Returning the fire, Bush spokesman Scott McClellan said,
''Governor Bush believes it is important to protect America and
Americans from rogue missile launches, and he is concerned that the
president and vice president do not agree with this urgent
priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is to decide later this year whether to deploy a
national anti-missile system that the Pentagon estimates would cost
$30 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to other areas, Clinton said Gore would help the economy
grow and would expand environmental cleanup efforts while Bush
would ''do what he did in Texas. He will let people who basically
are the primary polluters control environmental policy.''
</P>
<P>
   To that charge, McClellan said, ''Texas is leading the nation in
reducing toxics, and industrial emissions are down 11 percent under
Governor Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the next president would fill two to four seats on
the Supreme Court as expected vacancies come open. He said Gore
would appoint diverse judges committed to individual liberties and
''in the mainstream of American constitutional history.'' But he
said Bush would appoint judges ''more like the ones appointed by
the previous Reagan and Bush administrations.
</P>
<P>
   ''And if they get two to four appointments on the Supreme Court,
I think Roe vs. Wade will be repealed and a lot of other things
that have been a part of the fabric of our constitutional life will
be gone,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush says he opposes abortion except in cases of rape, incest or
danger to the life of the mother. He has said he would nominate
''strict constructionists'' to the court -- taken by some to mean
justices open to abortion restrictions. McClellan said it means
justices ''who will interpret law and not make law from the
bench.''

<HEADLINE> Prospective Organ Donor Shoots Self  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DELAWARE, Ohio (AP) -- A man walked into a hospital, handed the
admissions clerk a note saying he wanted to donate his organs and
then shot himself in the head, police said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Houston, 46, of Delaware was taken by helicopter to another
hospital about 20 miles away in Columbus, where he was in critical
condition Thursday, a hospital spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Houston walked into Grady Memorial Hospital's emergency room
Wednesday night and handed an envelope to the clerk at the
registration desk.
</P>
<P>
   He then said, ''Don't worry, I won't hurt you,'' placed a
.22-caliber handgun to his head and shot himself, said police Capt.
Mark Drum.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the envelope was a note detailing Houston's organ
donation plan and financial information regarding his funeral. It
did not say why Houston wanted to kill himself, Drum said.
</P>
<P>
   Houston owned a music shop and played guitar in a local band.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been one of the more active downtown businessmen,'' Drum
said. ''He rents a lot of various musical equipment to high school
bands and did a lot of instruction.''
</P>
<P>
   A man who answered the phone at the music store wouldn't comment
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Houston was arrested last September for criminal trespassing and
disorderly conduct but had no other problems with the law, Drum
said. Houston was allegedly involved in a dispute with a business
next door, Drum said.

<HEADLINE> Gloom Cast on Zimbabwe Peace Talks  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Threats of more violence and demands by
squatters for white-owned farmland dampened hope Thursday for a
quick end to months of farm occupations in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of farmers and the reported leader of the
squatters toured some of the worst-affected farming districts this
week. The goal was to persuade squatters to at least allow the
farms to work unhindered while the issue of land ownership was
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   But the excursion failed to ease tensions, making peace talks
seem headed toward failure.
</P>
<P>
   Violence and intimidation against farmers and their workers has
continued in most areas, the Commercial Farmers Union said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 white-owned farms have been occupied since early
February, when the government lost a constitutional referendum that
would have entrenched President Robert Mugabe's powers and allowed
the government to seize land without paying compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe's opponents say he allowed the violent occupations -- in
which three white farmers have been killed -- to punish farmers and
their workers for supporting the main opposition group, the
Movement for Democratic Change.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition group is seen as the first real challenge to
Mugabe's rule since 1980, when he led the nation to independence
from Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Farm union officials and Chenjerai Hunzvi, head of the National
Liberation War Veterans Association, agreed to tour the affected
lands this week and persuade the squatters to allow farmers to
plant their seeds and tend their fields.
</P>
<P>
   Two hundred occupiers demanded food and accommodation at one
property in the Centenery District, northeast of Harare. They
insisted the owner vacate his land.
</P>
<P>
   Another 250 occupiers dispersed across two other farms and
threatened violence unless they were given plots on the land.
</P>
<P>
   The situation was similar across the country all week, the union
said. On Wednesday, occupiers held four white farmers hostage for
three hours, after which they released them unharmed from a
besieged homestead in the eastern Manicaland province.
</P>
<P>
   Hunzvi's group reportedly has been leading the movement to
occupy white-owned land. But union members across the country have
reported splits among the occupiers, simultaneous with the
emergence of local warlords over whom Hunzvi's influence was
diminishing.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jerry Grant, deputy director of the farmers union, said that
in many areas the occupations were out of control.
</P>
<P>
   ''With various warlords doing what they like ... the situation
on the farms is anarchy,'' he told a meeting of Harare business
leaders. ''Any agreements we strike with Hunzvi are likely to be
ineffective.''

<HEADLINE> Carter Team To Visit Dominican  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) -- The Atlanta-based
Carter Center will send 24 elections observers to the Dominican
Republic to monitor May 16 elections, a spokeswoman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswoman Deanna Congileo said the delegation would not
include former President Jimmy Carter, despite reports in local
newspapers that Carter and four other former heads of state would
be observers.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping for a repeat of the 1996 elections, which were praised as
the Caribbean country's fairest vote ever, Dominican officials have
invited monitors from around the world to help observe polling.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Elections Board said Wednesday it had accredited a
host of former heads of state to serve as elections observers,
including Carter, former Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez,
ex-President Luis Herrera Campins of Venezuela and former President
Armando Calderon Sol of El Salvador.
</P>
<P>
   So far only former Colombian President Belisario Betancur has
said he would attend, the board said. The Colombian Embassy said
Thursday it had received no word of a visit by Betancur.

<HEADLINE> Gap Earnings Climb 23 Percent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Gap Inc.'s first-quarter earnings rose 23
percent from a year ago, boosted by strong sales at its new stores.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco-based retailer reported Thursday that it
earned $235.4 million, or 27 cents a share, in the quarter ended
April 29, compared with $202.4 million, or 22 cents a share, a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Total sales were $2.73 billion, up from $2.27 billion a year
ago. Sales at stores open at least a year, an industry gauge of
performance, fell 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Gap warned last week that its profits would fall slightly
below Wall Street analysts' estimates due to the cooler-than-normal
weather in April, which dampened demand for spring clothing.
</P>
<P>
   The Gap's results released on Thursday were in line with
analysts' revised expectations. The retailer's stock rose $2.18} to
$35.31\ in trading at 4:30 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Gap's growth during the quarter came from its new
stores. Over the last year, it has added more than 570 stores
across all of its brands, which include Gap, Banana Republic and
Old Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Its stores open at least a year saw some decline in sales
growth, especially its Gap stores where sales are down sharply from
a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Kmart Earnings Tumble 61 Percent  </HEADLINE>
By JIM SUHR
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Kmart Corp.'s first-quarter earnings fell by
nearly 61 percent as cooler-than-normal weather in April hurt
business at the giant discount store chain.
</P>
<P>
   The Troy, Mich.-based retailer said Thursday that it earned $22
million, or 5 cents a share, in the quarter ended April 26,
compared with $56 million, or 11 cents a share, a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sales for the quarter were $8.19 billion, up from $8.08 billion
a year ago. Sales at stores open at least a year, an industry gauge
of performance, were flat.
</P>
<P>
   Kmart warned last week that its first-quarter earnings would
fall short of Wall Street analysts' expectations due to a weak
sales in April due to cold, dreary weather.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts then revised their outlook for the quarter, and
the retailer met those revised estimates in its report released
Thursday. Kmart's stock fell 12{ cents to $7.50 in trading at 4:30
p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Barnard, who runs the consulting firm Barnard's Retail
Trend Report, said Kmart's latest numbers suffered because the
company failed to join other retailers in discounting items to lure
customers otherwise put off by April's weather.
</P>
<P>
   ''When the weather's like that -- with snowstorms and weather in
the 30s -- people don't feel like going out and buying things for
spring, and that's what hit Kmart,'' he said. Kmart ''did not
respond proactively to counter the unfavorable situation created by
the weather.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Hall, Kmart's chairman and chief executive, said in a
statement that the chain is ''taking steps to regain our sales
momentum and remain confident that we can meet or exceed the
Company's financial plans for the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnard agreed, calling the retailer's latest earnings ''a
short-term aberration'' and ''says nothing whatsoever about the
future of Kmart.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the immediate, foreseeable future for Kmart looks very
good,'' he said. ''I think Kmart is strong and has managed to
regain in the last couple of years its place in the sun as a viable
competitor in the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Kmart's latest earnings reflect its majority ownership of
Internet service provider and retailer BlueLight.com, which lost
about 2 cents per share in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Kmart operates 2,171 retail outlets.

<HEADLINE> Senate panel approves gun-control measures  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- A Senate committee Thursday unanimously
passed a package of bills that would outlaw the sale of hand guns
without child safety features.
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco, R-Union, the bill
sponsor, said the rules requiring child safety locks and mechanisms
that allow only the gun owner to fire the weapon are ''a
commonsense response'' to public calls to end gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   He and other supporters say the measures will save the lives of
children by preventing accidental shootings. They also maintain
that the ''smart guns'' will cut down on gun crime, since the
weapons would be useless to thieves.
</P>
<P>
   But a Yale University Law School researcher testified that such
laws show little effect on accidental shootings. Among the other
opponents was a nursing mother who said not all families want
''smart guns.'' Supporters include Cease-Fire New Jersey and the
New Jersey Catholic Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The senator admitted before the Law and Public Safety Committee
that ''smart gun'' technology is not available. His proposal allows
the state attorney general to decide when the technology is viable
and then to require every hand gun sold to be so equipped. Guns
used by police officers and antique guns would be exempt.
</P>
<P>
   ''The initiative does make it perfectly clear, however, that New
Jersey cares about its children, and is prepared to mandate, just
as we have done with car seats and bike helmets, any viable
technology that offers children greater protection from harm,''
DiFrancesco said.
</P>
<P>
   But the technology is unproven and it would force residents to
buy unsafe, untested guns, said Nancy Ross, spokeswoman for the
Association of New Jersey Rifle and Pistol Clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Ross charged that the senators were pandering to the public and
were trying to slip ''an unconstitutional ban'' on handguns into
law. The measure would make it illegal to use target pistols and
other small guns that can't be equipped with the ''smart gun''
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has nothing to do with safety. This is politics,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The same safety arguments were forwarded in 1990 when the state
required gun owners to lock up their pistols. But John Lott, a
research scholar at Yale University Law School, said his statistics
show that accidental gun deaths remained virtually unchanged after
that law was enacted. He also said crime rates have increased as
gun laws have been made tougher.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Levin, of Rutherford, nursed her child while telling
senators she opposed the bills.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't assume children will be safe. Don't assume all parents
and families support this because they don't,'' Levin said.

<HEADLINE> Retail Sales Fall 0.2 Percent  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dreary weather, stock market volatility and
rising interest rates helped pull Americans back from their
free-spending ways in April, sending retail sales down for the
first time since August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But economists said the weaker-than-expected sales will not stop
the Federal Reserve from boosting interest rates again next week.
</P>
<P>
   Sales at retail stores nationwide declined 0.2 percent last
month to a seasonally adjusted $266 billion following a brisk 0.5
percent increase in March, the Commerce Department said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   April's performance surprised many economists who predicted
sales would rise moderately.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected decline marked the first time retail sales have
fallen since August 1998 and was the biggest decrease since a 0.8
percent drop in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''The surprise decline ... may be the first indication that
higher interest rates and faltering stock markets are causing
consumers to cut back a little on their spending,'' said economist
Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors.
</P>
<P>
   Investors liked the report. The Dow Jones industrial average was
up 178.19 points to close at 10,545.97 and the Nasdaq gained 114.85
points to finish at 3,499.58.
</P>
<P>
   Economists widely expect that Fed policy-makers, which have
boosted interest rates five times by a quarter-point each since
June 30, will push rates higher when they meet Tuesday. A growing
number of economists are predicting a more aggressive half-point
increase even in light of Thursday's report.
</P>
<P>
   ''The pace of consumer spending in recent months has been
nothing short of breakneck,'' said economist Ken Mayland of
ClearView Economics. ''In order to ensure that consumer spending
growth will not flare up again, it will not deter them from raising
short-term interest rates the bigger 50 basis point step.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with April's decline, retail sales are running 9.7 percent
higher than the same month a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed raised rates in an attempt to slow the speeding economy
and its main engine, consumer spending, which accounts for
two-thirds of all economic activity. Those rate increases are
designed to make borrowing more expensive and thus cool demand for
big-ticket items such as cars and homes, a move that would help
keep inflation from escalating.
</P>
<P>
   A sharp drop in sales at gasoline stations, reflecting lower
prices at the pump, led last month's decline. But falling sales for
cars, clothing and building supplies also contributed to the
weaker-than-expected performance.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline sales fell a sharp 2.3 percent in April following a 4.3
percent gain the month before. Prices at the pump peaked in March
but edged down in April, reflecting lower crude-oil prices and
increased production.
</P>
<P>
   Sales at hardware, building and garden supply stores fell 1.6
percent after posting a 4.8 percent rise in March. Clothing store
sales declined by 0.9 percent, down from a 1.6 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   ''The cold and wet weather was definitely not conducive to
traditional spring purchases,'' said Rosalind Wells, chief
economist for the National Retail Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of new cars and trucks declined by 0.7 percent in April
after a 1.4 percent decrease the month before but still remain at
healthy levels.
</P>
<P>
   Showroom traffic was down last month, particularly for luxury
cars, said Paul Taylor, chief economist for the National Automobile
Dealers Association. A likely factor: stock market volatility,
which can make people feel less inclined to spend, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding the volatile autos category, retail sales were
unchanged in April, weaker than many analysts expected.
</P>
<P>
   Sales at bars and restaurants, meanwhile, fell 0.4 percent in
April, down from a 1.2 percent rise in March.
</P>
<P>
   There were some bright spots in April's report. Sales at grocery
stores rose a strong 1.1 percent. Department store sales grew by
0.4 percent and furniture store sales went up 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the nation's biggest chain stores last week reported
disappointing sales for April. Merchants were expecting a
blockbuster month because Easter fell later this year, shifting
most of the holiday buying into April.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the number of Americans filing new claims for
unemployment benefits last week fell by 7,000 to 297,000,
suggesting that businesses are scrambling to find qualified
workers.

<HEADLINE> Wheat Futures Soar Amid Demand  </HEADLINE>
By BENNIE M. CURRIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   Heavy buying in Egypt and anticipation of a promising demand
outlook for wheat sent futures soaring Thursday on the Chicago
Board of Trade, triggering speculation that U.S. wheat may be
gaining ground against global competition.
</P>
<P>
   In other commodity markets, pork bellies rallied on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange while crude oil prices surged sharply higher in
trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for U.S. wheat has been weak in foreign markets this
year, particularly due to competition within the European Community
and in Australia, which have routinely been offering lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   But wheat prices surged sharply in early trading Thursday on
word that Egypt purchased a combined 360,000 tons of soft red and
soft white U.S. wheat.
</P>
<P>
   ''Traditionally, Egypt will buy up to 500,000 tons of U.S. wheat
a week, given that breads and cereals are a major part of their
diet,'' said Tim Hannagan, chief grains analyst for Alaron Trading
Co. in Chicago. ''But (Thursday) they purchased more than half of
that in one day.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Wheat for July delivery rose 7 cents to $2.82 a
bushel.
</P>
<P>
   ''This may very well be because we're becoming a little more
fairly priced and because the U.S. crops generally are a higher
quality crop,'' Hannagan said. ''U.S. wheat generally is grown for
human consumption, so quality is more important than quantity. But
if we're becoming equal in value, then a buyer is going to go for
quality every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said investors also were acting on expectations that an
Agriculture Department report scheduled for release Friday would
bring encouraging news about demand for U.S. wheat. Wheat crops in
China and other countries have been suffering from a drought, which
could lead to lower production and a decrease in the amount of
grain left over for next season.
</P>
<P>
   In other activity on the Board of Trade, July corn rose { cent
to $2.44} a bushel; July oats rose \ cent to $1.23\ a bushel; July
soybeans fell 1{ cents to $5.68{ a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Chicago, a rebound in pork belly prices ended a
two-day crash on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Although analysts
said the slump may not yet be over, investors gained confidence
that demand for bacon and other pork products would heat up in the
prime summer season.
</P>
<P>
   July pork bellies rose 2.28 cents to 89.85 cents a pound as beef
and pork futures closed mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, June crude oil rose $1.01
to $29.11 a barrel behind an International Energy Agency report
that said oil stocks will be in decline in the third and fourth
quarters of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Among other energy commodities, June heating oil rose 4.03 cent
to 77.31 cents a gallon; June unleaded gasoline rose 2.44 cents to
93.64 cents a gallon; June natural gas rose 3.5 cents to $3.352 per
1,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   In London, June Brent crude from the North Sea rose $1.03 to
$27.45 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico reached a free-trade agreement with
Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras Thursday, after eight years of
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement calls for trade barriers to be dismantled over 11
years for industrial products and 12 years for agricultural
products.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican Commerce Secretary Herminio Blanco said the agreement
covers industrial goods, services, investment protection,
intellectual property and conflict resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the four countries reached the agreement after
settling differences over Mexican exports of beer and steel. The
accord will take effect on Jan. 1, if ratified by the Mexican
Senate and the legislatures of the three Central American
countries.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to wean itself from dependence on the United
States, Mexico recently reached free trade agreements with the
European Union and Israel. It already has free trade pacts with the
United States, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia, Costa
Rica and Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico does most of its trading with the United States, the
focus of 83 percent of Mexican trade last year.

<HEADLINE> NIH To Sponsor AIDS Vaccine Trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A clinical trial testing an HIV treatment
vaccine in patients already infected with the virus will begin in
two weeks under the sponsorship of the National Institutes of
Health, officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The trial will enlist 472 HIV-infected volunteers at 40 centers
in the United States and will last 96 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James McNamara of the division of AIDS at the National
Institute of Allergy and Infections Diseases, a part of NIH, said
the goal is to learn if a vaccine will prompt an immune system
response against HIV in patients infected with the virus that
causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The trial will enroll patients who already are taking a
multi-drug therapy that has been shown to control the replication
of HIV and who have a low level of virus in their blood.
</P>
<P>
   McNamara said the study will determine if adding the vaccine
will trigger a natural immune system against HIV that many patients
lack. If the vaccine works, he said, it could prolong the
effectiveness of the multi-drug therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine, called Remune, is made by the Immune Response Corp.
of Carlsbad, Calif. It is made from killed HIV virus particles.
</P>
<P>
   Remune, unlike most vaccines, is not designed to prevent HIV
disease, but to provide a treatment for patients already infected.
The NIH is sponsoring two HIV preventative vaccine trials, one in
Thailand and one in the United States. Those vaccines are designed
to keep patients from becoming infected with HIV.

<HEADLINE> Gore Trade Stance, Labor at Odds  </HEADLINE>
By CALVIN WOODWARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Suggesting Al Gore's standing among union
members may be shaky, a labor leader sharply criticized the
Democratic presidential candidate Thursday for stepping forward to
advocate a trade deal with China.
</P>
<P>
   George Becker, president of the United Steelworkers of America,
said his union's endorsement of Gore is not at risk but the rank
and file probably won't mobilize for him in the fall if he
continues ''championing'' the agreement to give China normal trade
status on a permanent basis.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is something where we can't just shrug our shoulders and
say it doesn't mean anything and we're together on everything
else,'' he told The Associated Press. In the fight for
congressional passage of the agreement, ''Gore should be encouraged
to step out.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore and many unions have a mutually acknowledged disagreement
on trade with China, and Gore's support for the deal was known when
the steelworkers' union endorsed him in October, shortly after the
AFL-CIO did the same.
</P>
<P>
   Becker, who has been one of the vice president's most vocal
critics within labor, said Gore assured him before the endorsement
that he would not take an active role in support of the agreement,
that he would ''keep a low profile on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Becker's remarks were the first open assertion by a labor leader
that Gore had promised not to lobby for the China deal.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, campaign spokesman for Gore, denied the vice
president had offered any such assurance. ''Al Gore did not make a
commitment not to lobby,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The disagreement points to strains between some union members
and their leaders over organized labor's embrace of Gore despite
his support of trade policies that industrial workers fear will
cost them their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   A Voter.com-Battleground poll out Thursday indicated Republican
George W. Bush has improved his standing with union households and
is running about even with Gore among those voters.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, like Gore, supports the bill to give China permanent
access to low U.S. tariffs in return for a further opening of the
Chinese market to American goods and services. A closely divided
House is expected to vote the week of May 22.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has not been a principal player in the lobbying, but he has
advocated the deal in increasingly firm terms in recent public
appearances -- most forcefully this week in a White House event with
Clinton and former presidents Carter and Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's allies attribute his limited contribution to the
congressional arm-twisting to the demands of his campaign; critics
say he is trying to avoid serious fissures with the labor and
environmental activists whose energy, money and organizing savvy he
will need in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, unions have been accused of glossing over
their dispute with Gore while sparing no effort to attack members
of Congress, including Democrats, who back the China deal.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-deal Democrats are being told that while unions will mount
voter-mobilization efforts on behalf of the party's candidates,
they may do so with much less enthusiasm -- and therefore less
effect -- than in recent elections.
</P>
<P>
   Becker cited no evidence that Gore is lobbying particularly
hard. What counts, he said, is that his members believe Gore is
doing too much.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our membership is viewing Gore as standing with the president
on this and as supporting (the measure) in a very real way,'' he
said. ''This bothers us tremendously.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehane said Gore has contacted a ''bunch'' of members of
Congress with a pitch that the deal is good for America, its
workers, the environment and the cause of human rights in China.
The campaign has repeatedly declined to say how many he's called or
to identify them.

<HEADLINE> Egan's elevation cheered by Bridgeport, New York faithful  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- Bridgeport's loss is New York's gain,
parishioners of Bishop Edward M. Egan said Thursday as they
celebrated his appointment to succeed the late Cardinal John
O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican announced Thursday that Egan, who has headed the
diocese in this gritty, blue-collar city since 1988, would become
the ninth archbishop to New York's 2.4 million Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're sad to see him go, but they're lucky to get him,'' said
Josephine LaMotta, a secretary in the Bridgeport diocese's
education office. ''He's a very caring person. He cares about the
schools and he cares about people in general.''
</P>
<P>
   Egan spent 22 years in Rome as a professor of canon law at the
Gregorian University and as a judge in a church tribunal. He also
spent 3{ years as an auxiliary bishop and vicar of education in New
York before being named bishop in Bridgeport in December 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Egan, 68, earned high praise here for regionalizing the diocese
schools, bringing local men into the priesthood and raising
millions for church causes. The diocese spans all of Fairfield
County, which is among the fastest-growing and wealthiest in the
nation, but is centered in the poor city of Bridgeport.
</P>
<P>
   Some pastors complained that despite successful fund-raising,
Egan closed several inner-city schools and sold to private
operators Stamford's large Catholic hospital, forcing the nuns who
ran it into retirement.
</P>
<P>
   When the Chicago archdiocese became vacant, Egan was rumored to
be the leading candidate for the post, which went instead to
Francis Cardinal George. A joke then making the rounds of the
Bridgeport diocese was that at least a dozen pastors had
volunteered to carry him to the airport. Egan himself roared when
he heard it.
</P>
<P>
   At St. Patrick's Cathedral -- the landmark seat of Egan's new
archdiocese -- prayers were offered for him at two early Masses
Thursday. Parishioners said they would welcome the new archbishop's
leadership, but noted O'Connor, who died last week, still is
greatly missed.
</P>
<P>
   ''He looks like a good man,'' said Elssy Mino, a saleswoman from
the borough of Queens. ''Nobody's going to replace O'Connor, but I
think Egan will be OK. He seems very sweet and nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Egan hews closely to the church's positions on issues such as
abortion, birth control and homosexual acts. Among conservative
Catholics, his stance was welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those are my views also,'' said Stephen Salmon, a math and
special education teacher in Bridgeport public schools. ''The
church is not going to change on those things because that's truth.
For a while, public opinion may go the other way, but I think in
the end public opinion will be the same as the Catholic position.''
</P>
<P>
   But among more liberal Catholics, Egan's strict adherence to
church doctrine is seen as somewhat out of touch.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the church definitely needs to relax,'' said Bonnie
Genest, a training manager at an Internet company in Trumbull.
''Some values you need to keep and there are others you need to
move along with as the world moves along.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Genest disagrees with Egan and the church on
abortion and homosexuality, she praised him as a ''great leader''
and a ''great person.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He did my son's confirmation, and I don't think I've ever seen
my son sit and listen that way,'' she said. ''I was impressed with
the way he was with the children.''
</P>
<P>
   While in Bridgeport, Egan has dealt with more than two dozen
lawsuits alleging children were molested by priests from the 1960s
through the 1990s. He created controversy by asserting in one case
that priests were independent contractors who work for individual
parishes, not the diocese.
</P>
<P>
   The law firm that represents 21 plaintiffs suing the diocese
issued a statement Thursday critical of Egan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bishop Egan has never offered his support, his apologies nor
counseling to any of the plaintiffs, all of who have suffered
horrible emotional scars,'' said attorney Cindy Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Drohan, a spokesman for the Bridgeport diocese, said Egan
has strongly condemned the alleged sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ''The plaintiffs' lawyers are transparent in trying to push
their own names onto newspaper pages when the rest of the world is
celebrating hard-earned success for Bishop Egan,'' Drohan said.

<HEADLINE> Victim Advocates Seek Tougher Laws  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Victim rights advocates pleaded with a House
panel Thursday to keep fighting for tougher crime laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are a nation that continues to put violent felons back on
the streets, knowing full well they will rape, molest and murder
again,'' said Fred Goldman, whose son Ron was stabbed to death in
1994 with Nicole Simpson, the ex-wife of former football star O.J.
Simpson. ''What does that say about us as a nation?''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman was joined by Gail Willard, whose daughter Aimee was
killed by a convicted murderer released from a Nevada prison after
serving 12 years of a life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   They urged the House Judiciary subcommittee on crime to pass
''Aimee's law,'' which would transfer federal crime money from a
state that releases a violent felon to the state that convicts the
person the second time.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Aimee's law is passed in 2000, states will have strong
incentive to reform their parole systems and to keep predators in
prison actually for life,'' Willard said.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee heard testimony about three other bills: the
''Two Strikes, You're Out Child Protection Act,'' which would make
any second sex offense crime against a child a federal crime;
''Matthew's Law,'' which would increase penalties against people
who commit crimes against children under 13; and the ''Stop
Material Unsuitable for Teens'' or ''SMUT'' act, which would
increase penalties for distributing obscene materials to children
under 16.
</P>
<P>
   ''While each differs from the others, each sounds a common theme
-- an attempt to provide greater protections for our most precious
national asset, our children,'' said Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla.,
the subcommittee chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The House has passed similar bills before but none has become
law.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the bills has opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut state Rep. Mike Lawlor called Aimee's Law ''worse
than an unfunded mandate.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Should this proposal become law, every state will be subject
to the loss of most, if not all, federal law enforcement
assistance,'' said Lawlor, chairman of the Connecticut House
Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   States will try to recoup that money by investigating the
out-of-state records of their current prisoners and charging other
states for the allowable expenses, he said. ''I'm not sure what the
point of this bureaucratic exercise would be,'' Lawlor said.
</P>
<P>
   Law professor Franklin Zimring of the University of California
at Berkeley said action on any of the bills would be premature.
</P>
<P>
   ''Symbolic gestures are easier to find than measures with strong
preventive potential,'' he said. ''None of the group of proposals
before the committee today is a promising method of legislating
public safety.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 178; Nasdaq Gains 115  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose broadly Thursday after a report of a
slowdown in retail sales calmed investors who have been selling
stocks amid fears about rising interest rates. Blue chip shares led
the advance.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 178.19 at 10,545.97 and
the Nasdaq composite index was up 114.85 at 3,499.58.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 rose 24.76 to 1,407.81. But volume remained light, leaving
market analysts unconvinced of the rally's underlying strength.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a really rough start to the week,'' said Bob Dickey,
managing director of technical analysis at Dain Rauscher Wessels.
''So at this point, calling this an oversold bounce is about as
bullish as we can get.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the market's gains were sparked by good news on the
economic front. Stocks rose after the Commerce Department said
retail sales fell 0.2 percent. Economists had expected a increase
of 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were quick to cite bad weather in April that kept many
Americans out of the stores. But the decline raised some hopes that
the Federal Reserve's series of interest rate increases is
succeeding in slowing consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed is widely expected to raise interest rates again at
meeting on Tuesday. Economists are divided on whether central
bankers will stick to their strategy of boosting rates by a
quarter-percentage point at a time, or whether they will opt for a
half-percentage point increase this time.
</P>
<P>
   The retail sales report alone won't dissuade the Fed from the
harsher, half-point increase, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appears that the volatile stock market and higher interest
rates have started to slow consumer spending,'' said Stan Shipley,
senior economist at Merrill Lynch. ''However, this one-month
slowdown should not derail the Fed.''
</P>
<P>
   Rate-sensitive stocks rose after the retail sales report was
released. J.P. Morgan rose 5 to 127| and Citigroup rose 2{ to 58
15/16.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, which fell sharply on Wednesday, rebounded 9{ to 115 9/16
-- the biggest gainer among all 30 Dow components.
</P>
<P>
   Bargain-hunting opportunities lured some investors into the
technology sector. High-tech stocks have been battered in recent
sessions, leaving their prices significantly lower than they were
earlier this year, before the Nasdaq began its initial descent from
record levels. Texas Instruments rose 6| to 138| and Micron
Technology gained 7 11/16 to 57 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   But some skittishness lingered in high-tech stocks. Applied
Materials teetered between gains and losses before closing up | at
85\. After the close of trading Wednesday, the company reported
operating earnings of 55 cents a share, in line with analysts'
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said Applied Materials failed to get a bounce from the
strong earnings report because many investors were hoping for the
company, a leading maker of equipment used in the semiconductor
industry, to exceed estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Volume was light, with 1.14 billion shares changing hands as of
5:45 p.m., compared with 1.20 billion in the previous session. Low
volume can exacerbate price swings, creating volatility in even the
quietest session.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we'll see some continued volatility until the Fed's
meeting,'' said Dain Rauscher's Dickey. ''The best thing for the
market would be to get it over with. If we get the half-point
increase that many people are expecting, investors could breathe a
sigh of relief.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. stocks overcame a sharp selloff in Japan. The Nikkei stock
average plunged 4.63 percent to its lowest close in 7{ months.
Traders cited Wall Street's decline on Wednesday, when the Dow fell
168 points and the Nasdaq plunged 200 points.
</P>
<P>
   European markets were unscathed by the heavy selling in Japan.
Germany's Xetra DAX index rose 2.0 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100
rose 2.4 percent, and France's CAC-40 gained 1.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a better than 2-to-1
margin on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 15.11 to
489.39.

<HEADLINE> Bush Opposes Gun Suit Bill  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- George W. Bush, in yet another disagreement
with Al Gore on guns, said Thursday he would not support federal
legislation allowing cities to sue gunmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Expanding on comments he made last week while discussing such
legislation, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee said
such a law is ''not good public policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the governor of Texas, last year signed a state law
prohibiting cities and counties from directly suing gunmakers. He
previously has avoided directly stating whether he would support a
similar law at the federal level.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic presidential rival Gore has said he would veto any
bill prohibiting such lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Asked during an appearance on ''Lifetime Live,'' on the women's
cable channel Lifetime, if he were ''willing to go along'' with
Gore on the matter, Bush replied:
</P>
<P>
   ''No, I'm not at all. I think that's allowing trial lawyers to
sue people as an excuse for legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ''It's not good public policy. These manufacturers are
manufacturing a legal product, and the interesting public policy
question is if you sue somebody for manufacturing this legal
product, are you allowed to sue somebody else for manufacturing a
legal product?''
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and Gore have been trying to raise doubts about each
other's commitment to gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has complained that Gore frequently voted with the gun
lobby while serving in Congress, despite his criticism of the
National Rifle Association. Gore has suggested Bush would be a
puppet of the NRA.
</P>
<P>
   Gunmakers sought protection after cities began filing lawsuits
accusing them of failing to equip their products with safety
features. Negotiations between gunmakers and 31 municipalities to
settle the lawsuits are now on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Gore asked whether Bush would veto any bill
prohibiting such lawsuits. Bush said in reply: ''It depends on
what's in the legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ''You can get a feel for my position by looking at
what I've done in office, and what I did in office was sign a bill
that made it very difficult for local municipalities to sue
manufacturers of a legal product.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was referring to the 1999 state law that requires Texas
cities or counties that want to sue gunmakers to funnel the
litigation through the state attorney general, who may or may not
proceed.
</P>
<P>
   The measure is similar to ones supported by other Republican
governors and was a follow-up to Bush's efforts to curb other forms
of civil litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's totally irresponsible to side with weapons manufacturers
against concerned citizens in local communities,'' said Gore
campaign spokesman Doug Hattaway. ''He's turned his back on our
communities and stood with the gun lobby lock, stock and barrel.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokeswoman Karen Hughes said his objection to
such legislation at the federal level is rooted in his
long-standing opposition to measures that would undercut state's
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''He would not support a federal law that would override state
restrictions,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Also during the Lifetime interview, Bush restated his positions
on gun control. He favors instant background checks for buyers and
swift enforcement of gun laws for violators. He also supports
requiring manufacturers to sell the guns with trigger locks, but
opposes a law mandating that the locks be used, saying it would be
unenforceable.
</P>
<P>
   Gore supports licensing all new handgun purchases, a waiting
period for buying guns and limiting individual gun sales to one per
month. He also supports mandatory child safety locks and has worked
to require background checks for gun purchases at gun shows.

<HEADLINE> Medicare To Clarify Coverage Rules  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Medicare plans to clarify criteria used to
decide which new health care products and services the nation's
insurance program for the elderly and disabled will pay for.
</P>
<P>
   The Health and Human Services Department announced Thursday that
upcoming regulations will more precisely define Medicare's
long-used rule that care must be ''reasonable and necessary'' to
qualify for coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules, two tests would have to be met:
</P>
<P>
   --Clinical evidence would have to exist showing medical benefits.
</P>
<P>
   --The product or service would also have to have ''added value''
over existing coverage, such as lower cost, improved health
outcomes, or a new treatment choice, such as medication in place of
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations will be formally proposed after a 30-day comment
period, the agency said. Then, they would not become final until
after an additional public vetting.

<HEADLINE> US Study May Have Sickened Chinese  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A U.S.-funded study in China might have
accidentally exposed participants to the bacterium that causes
stomach ulcers, prompting National Cancer Institute doctors to help
administer antibiotics to up to 500 people.
</P>
<P>
   It's still unclear if the research was to blame, cautioned Dr.
Susan Nayfield, chief of the NCI unit that oversees international
research safety. China already had one of world's highest rates of
infection with the H. pylori bacterium.
</P>
<P>
   But NCI and Chinese scientists are investigating whether study
participants were infected by dirty endoscopes, tubes snaked down
the throat to inspect the stomach, Nayfield said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The NCI funded two studies in the rural Shandong province
starting in 1989, to examine the prevalence of stomach cancer and
H. pylori and to see if certain nutritional supplements affected
either condition. H. pylori causes stomach ulcers, and is suspected
to play a role in stomach cancer. China also has high rates of
stomach cancer, relatively rare in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the first study, between 1989 and 1994, used endoscopes
to examine participants' stomachs.
</P>
<P>
   When the second study began in the late 1990s, scientists
recorded more H. pylori infections than expected -- a possible
increase of 40 percent, Nayfield said.
</P>
<P>
   Unknown to the NCI, Chinese health officials in the early 1990s
declared endoscopes could be cleaned by wiping them with a special
cloth instead of soaking them in a sterilizer, the method U.S.
officials recommend when disposable endoscopes can't be used.
</P>
<P>
   The question: Could dirty endoscopes be to blame, did infections
rise overall in Shandong, or was there a testing error?
</P>
<P>
   The NCI and an independent safety board couldn't say, but NCI
scientists departed for China a few weeks ago to help provide
antibiotics to clear up the infections.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the scientists will test-clean endoscopes using the wiping
method to see if H. pylori could survive that way, something no one
yet knows, Nayfield said.

<HEADLINE> No Referendum for Soybean Program  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farmers who are opposed to a research and
promotion program for soybeans fell far short of getting enough
support from other producers to force a referendum on the issue,
the Agriculture Department says.
</P>
<P>
   The program is funded through a ''checkoff'' fee paid by
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60,000 farmers had to request a referendum -- 10
percent of the 600,813 soybean producers nationwide -- but only
17,970 completed valid forms, the department said Thursday. Nearly
9,800 of the requests came from Illinois and Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ''With this result, U.S. soybean farmers have validated their
support for the soybean checkoff,'' said Don Latham, chairman of
the United Soybean Board, which runs the program.
</P>
<P>
   USDA also supervises promotion programs for milk, dairy
products, watermelons, honey, popcorn, potatoes, peanuts,
mushrooms, beef, pork, cotton and eggs.

<HEADLINE> India's Billionth Person Is Born  </HEADLINE>
By NEELESH MISRA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- A bouncing baby girl named Astha
officially pushed India's population over the 1 billion mark
Thursday. Her birth was greeted with both fanfare and concern over
the nation's escalating growth rate.
</P>
<P>
   Astha -- ''faith'' in Hindi -- was born to Anjana and Ashok Arora
at 5:05 a.m. Thursday, making India only the second nation after
China to exceed a billion people.
</P>
<P>
   With an estimated 42,000 births per day in India, it was
impossible to know exactly where the billionth baby would be born,
but the government staged the milestone as part of a public
campaign to encourage Indians to have smaller families.
</P>
<P>
   Astha, wailing, was wheeled out with her sari-clad mother just
nine hours after she was born to face a crowd of government
ministers and a horde of journalists at Safdarjang Hospital in the
Indian capital. She weighed six pounds 13 ounces, doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel fine,'' said the mother, Anjana, weak and overwhelmed
by the chaotic reception. ''I'm happy,'' said Ashok Arora, who
works in an automotive spare parts shop for a salary of $50 per
month.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't crush the baby,'' Sumitra Mahajan, the minister for
women and child welfare, screamed into her microphone as nearly 200
journalists swarmed over the mother's bed. Hospital guards climbed
onto a nearby bed and beat back the journalists with wooden
truncheons.
</P>
<P>
   Every measure of progress India has made since independence in
1947 has been swamped by the swelling population: Food production
has tripled, yet many people go hungry; literacy has increased, but
so has the overall number of illiterate people.
</P>
<P>
   The government picked May 11 as the date -- calling it ''a moment
of celebration, a moment to ponder.'' Health Ministry officials,
with the concurrence of the U.N. Population Fund, decreed that a
baby girl born this morning in the 1,500-bed Safdarjang Hospital
would symbolically mark the milestone. Twenty-four babies were born
in Safdarjang between midnight and noon.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of a baby girl reflects another part of the
government's attempts to change Indians' family attitudes:
promoting fair treatment for infant girls to overcome traditional
biases in favor of boys.
</P>
<P>
   The last national census in 1991 said there were 927 women for
every 1,000 men in India. Health experts said that reflected a
trend in rural and poor areas that gives boys preferential
treatment in food and health care. Infanticide of baby girls
remains a problem.
</P>
<P>
   The billionth birth was hardly cause for celebration. Since its
independence, India has had little success curbing its exploding
population. When it became a nation, India had 300 million people.
</P>
<P>
   ''We welcome Astha, but we should also be thinking whether she
would get an opportunity for education and health like millions of
other children,'' said Mahajan, the government minister. ''Will we
be able to get her the resources and the opportunities necessary
for her future? This is what we have to think about.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning this morning, a recording by the state-owned telephone
company told anyone who picked up the phone to dial in New Delhi,
''Our population has now reached 1 billion. Let's have small
families for a stronger India.''
</P>
<P>
   Projections say that if India does not curtail population growth
it will surpass China as the world's most populous nation in 50
years with 1.5 billion people.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to encourage family planning among the poor suffered a
setback in the 1970s when the government sponsored a mass
sterilization campaign, in which poor people were duped or paid to
undergo vasectomies and tubectomies.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis has changed in the last decade toward educating
women, raising their status and providing better health care.
Nongovernment organizations tour rural areas distributing condoms
and discussing birth control, but sex education is not taught in
the schools.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Gas Prices Rise Expected  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE STANLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Greater crude oil supplies helped ease gasoline
prices in April, but a surge in the number of people driving during
the summer is expected to push up prices at the pump soon, a
respected industry survey said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Global oil supplies grew last month by 700,000 barrels a day, or
almost 1 percent, with Iraq accounting for much of the increase in
exports. As a result, prices for crude fell from their March levels
by an average of more than $4 a barrel, the International Energy
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for gasoline and other refined products reflected only
part of this reduction in the price for crude. Gasoline supplies
were pinched because many U.S. and European refineries curtailed
output in order to refurbish their equipment, the IEA said.
</P>
<P>
   The report predicted that any additional price relief for
motorists would be brief. A rise in demand during the peak summer
driving season in North America and Europe threatens to trigger
another round of retail price hikes, it said.
</P>
<P>
   The Paris-based IEA is part of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development, a group of the world's wealthiest
countries.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. gasoline prices remained fairly steady in late April and
early May. The average pump price nationwide was $1.5295 per gallon
on Friday, according to the Lundberg Survey of 10,000 stations.
That was down 25 cents from April 21.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's doubtful they're going to get too much cheaper. The
season's about to begin,'' said Peter Gignoux, managing director of
the petroleum desk at Salomon Smith Barney in London.
</P>
<P>
   One surprise in the IEA report was that imports of oil by seven
major consuming countries fell 4 percent in March compared to the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
   The IEA said the decrease was exaggerated because demand was
unusually strong during the previous March. Nonetheless, Leo
Drollas, chief economist at the Center for Global Energy Studies in
London, said the decline was staggering.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems the high prices of 1999 are starting to hit the
developed countries with a vengeance,'' Drollas said.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices tripled after OPEC members agreed to curtail
production in March 1999, rising above $34 a barrel for West Texas
Crude at one point.
</P>
<P>
   The IEA predicted that year-on-year demand would rebound by 2.8
percent in the second quarter, 2.8 percent in the third quarter and
2.9 percent in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   These increased needs will have to be met mostly with crude
exports from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
</P>
<P>
   World output of oil increased after OPEC decided on March 28 to
boost production back to what it was before last year's cuts.
Production jumped to 76.3 million barrels a day in April, an
increase of 660,000 barrels, the IEA said. Output rose in every
OPEC country except for Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Oil exports from former members of the Soviet Union reached a
record high in April, but total non-OPEC production declined, due
partly to foul weather and technical problems for Norway's North
Sea oil rigs.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq accounted for more than half of the April increase in OPEC
supplies, even though it did not participate in the group's latest
agreement to boost output.
</P>
<P>
   Gignoux described Iraq as OPEC's ''swing producer'' in today's
spot market and said the country has restored its production
capacity almost to what it was before the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   ''Iraq is still the major supply wild card for the near-term oil
markets,'' the IEA said.
</P>
<P>
   In trading, June contracts of West Texas Intermediate crude
closed up $1.01 to $29.11 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   In London, June Brent crude from the North Sea rose $1.03 to
$27.45 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Army Extends Korea War Slay Probe  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Army investigators, struggling to piece
together a coherent version from inconsistent accounts, are
extending a probe of civilian killings by U.S. soldiers during the
Korean War, American officials say.
</P>
<P>
   After interviewing more than 100 people, a U.S. official said
investigators believe ''something tragic happened'' in the South
Korean hamlet of No Gun Ri in the opening days of the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   But because of discrepancies in accounts provided by U.S.
veterans and Korean survivors, they will almost certainly be unable
to finish it before the original target of June 25, the 50th
anniversary of the start of the conflict in Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said Thursday the investigation
is likely to last until fall. ''It would be better not to
salami-slice the findings and to wait for the Army to conclude its
work and come out with everything at once,'' Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation was begun after The Associated Press, in a
report last fall, quoted U.S. veterans as saying American soldiers
killed at least 100 civilians. Korean survivors said as many as 300
civilians were shot to death under a railroad bridge at No Gun Ri
following a strafing in which about 100 died.
</P>
<P>
   Two officials, who recently discussed the matter separately on
condition of anonymity, said investigators have not verified the
scope of the alleged mass killings at the village. They also said
they have not yet established that the killings, which began on
July 26, 1950, were ordered by superior officers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're quite aware that something tragic happened there,'' an
official familiar with the investigation said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that after interviews that included some of
the veterans who were at No Gun Ri and reviewing several thousand
historical documents -- Army investigators are wrestling with
''evidentiary inconsistencies.''
</P>
<P>
   One account the investigators were having trouble reconciling
was that of Edward Daily of Clarksville, Tenn., who has been
especially visible in recounting his role in the episode.
</P>
<P>
   Army spokesman Maj. Thomas Collins acknowledged that ''there are
a lot of inconsistencies that we're aware of'' in Daily's story.
Collins said Army officials contacted Daily on Wednesday to
reinterview him, but he told them he was done talking about the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   The AP reported on an order issued by the 1st Cavalry Division
headquarters in late July 1950 that said: ''No refugees to cross
the front line. Fire everyone trying to cross lines. Use discretion
in case of women and children.''
</P>
<P>
   An AP request to interview Charles Cragin, the Pentagon official
directing the review, was denied Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators are still grappling with such questions as how
many people were killed, who may have issued orders to open fire,
and whether the shootings were provoked by gunfire from among the
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to soldiers, the Army interviewed dozens of Korean
survivors, and sources familiar with the investigation said the
accounts were compelling.
</P>
<P>
   But the sources said investigators were having difficulty
reconstructing a consistent version from witnesses' memories of
events that occurred a half-century ago. They said there were
direct contradictions in the stories, even in conflicting accounts
given by the same person.
</P>
<P>
   The sources spoke on condition of anonymity, reflecting the
investigators' determination to avoid influencing the investigation
or triggering diplomatic problems between Washington and Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. investigators met with a visiting South Korean delegation
in early May and turned over transcripts of interviews with U.S.
veterans, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Collins declined to comment on a report Wednesday by
Stripes.com, a privately owned Internet site for veterans, which
contended two of the dozens of Korean and U.S. witnesses who
described the No Gun Ri incident to the AP were not there at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   The Stripes.com report, citing a regimental document, asserted
that Delos K. Flint, an ex-GI eyewitness quoted by the AP, was
wounded and evacuated July 25, the day before the shooting started.
But a company ''morning report,'' obtained by the AP in June 1998,
says he was wounded the next day, July 26.
</P>
<P>
   The Stripes.com report also said newly released Army personnel
records indicate that Daily served in an ordnance maintenance unit
and was not in the front line unit -- H Company, 2nd Battalion of
the 7th Cavalry -- at the time of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   But Army spokesman Collins said, ''This doesn't change anything.
Ed Daily is just one guy of many that we've been talking to.''
</P>
<P>
   Five other soldiers interviewed by the AP in investigating No
Gun Ri said Daily was in H Company at the time, and he produced
documents to verify his presence in H Company then.
</P>
<P>
   The sources said investigators had questions about some of
Daily's assertions, including his presence at No Gun Ri and his
claim to have received a battlefield commission as an officer.
</P>
<P>
   Stripes.com is owned by IServed.com of Pittsburgh and publishes
the Web site and the domestic bimonthly publication under the name
The Stars and Stripes. The overseas Stars and Stripes newspaper, a
separate publication that circulates in Europe and Asia, is a U.S.
military publication.
</P>
<P>
   The weekly U.S. News and World Report magazine will publish a
story Saturday that challenges the accounts of Daily, Flint and
another veteran, Gene Hesselman. Brian Duffy, the magazine's
executive editor, said the story raised questions about whether the
three ''were in fact present at the time the incident allegedly
occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   Hesselman has told the AP he was offered a medical evacuation
after being slightly wounded that day but decided to remain in the
front line instead.
</P>
<P>
   At AP headquarters in New York, spokeswoman Kelly Smith Tunney
said the AP account, which last month was awarded a Pulitzer Prize,
was based on extensive witness interviews in the United States and
South Korea and an examination of U.S. military records.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ed Daily was but one of many voices in this story and he has
repeated and vouched for the account he provided AP,'' she said.
''We're aware of discrepancies in Daily's military records and he
has shown an AP reporter documents that he says support his
contention that he served with H Company in 1950.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said the Army's inquiry would not be influenced by any
news accounts of the No Gun Ri incident.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are conducting a comprehensive review of the facts,''
Collins said. ''As part of that review, the IG (inspector general)
is reviewing the records of many Korean War veterans, to include
Edward Daily's. It is premature to discuss our findings until the
review is complete.''
</P>
<P>
   Before publication of the AP story, South Koreans who sought
acknowledgment of the killings and compensation were told by U.S.
officials that the allegations had been investigated and no
evidence of a massacre was found. After the AP story was published,
Caldera ordered ''as quick and thorough a review of these matters
as possible.''

<HEADLINE> Court: Mother's IQ test can't be required in lead claim  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER JORDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A mother cannot be forced to take an IQ test
to prove her son's mental injuries were due to lead paint exposure
and not hereditary, the state's highest court ruled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But the Court of Appeals specified that its decision applied to
the one case it considered Thursday and did not rule out parental
IQ testing in other lead-poisoning cases. In this latter part of
the decision, it rejected the reasoning of a lower court which said
the parents could not be tested.
</P>
<P>
   ''Each request must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis,''
Judge Carmen Beauchamp Ciparick wrote for the court, with five
other members of the panel concurring and Judge Joseph Bellacosa
not taking part. The court cited New York's strong policy
supporting open disclosure and even said the woman's IQ was not
confidential, just not particularly relevant or questionable in
this case.
</P>
<P>
   Although the ruling was against the landlord, it was seen as a
success for New York City and a powerful coalition of corporate and
insurance groups that sided with the apartment owner since it did
not deny IQ testing in other cases.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm heartened that the court left the door open,'' said
attorney Andrew Zajac, who filed a friend-of-the-court brief for
the Defense Association of New York. ''We think it's crucial.''
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence examinations of mothers and other close relatives
are important to the city's defense in the 1,300 similar lead paint
claims it faces, it argued in a friend-of-the-court brief.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are gratified,'' said New York City counsel Margaret King.
''We would view this as a qualified victory.''
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for the mother, Prudencia Andon, said she would now
move forward with her suit against 302-304 Mott Street Associates,
owner of the lower Manhattan apartment building where she lived.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Andon claimed her then 1-year-old son, Antonio, had
learning disabilities, delayed speech and language, and behavioral
problems because of lead paint in the apartment. The arguments over
the IQ test had been brought up in pretrial motions.
</P>
<P>
   A state Supreme Court had ruled that an IQ test could be
administered. But the Appellate Division had reversed that ruling,
saying that the test would raise more questions than it would
answer.
</P>
<P>
   Andon's attorney Alexander Wulwick, who had argued that forcing
the IQ test on the mother would ''extend to the hotly debated
question of whether and to what degree, IQ is inherited ... with
each side producing competing experts'' on nature vs. nurture.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's ruling also agreed that the landlord's expert
witness, a doctor, did not offer enough evidence to support his
opinion that the mother's IQ was ''extremely relevant'' in this
case.
</P>
<P>
   The New York State Trial Lawyers Association had weighed in on
the case on behalf of the mother. That group did not return a call
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   About three-quarters of housing built before 1978 contains
lead-based paint, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
If not maintained, the federal agency, it can result, especially in
young children, in permanent damage to the brain, nervous system
and kidneys.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak Reports Rider, Revenue Hike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amtrak riders and revenue increased in the
first four months of 2000 compared with the same period last year,
the railway announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak collected $638 million in revenue from January through
April, 8 percent better than last year. Ridership topped 7 million
customers, up 3.4 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
   Ridership in April was 7 percent higher than in April 1999,
Amtrak said.
</P>
<P>
   Among long-distance trains, the New York-Chicago ''Three
Rivers'' route recorded a 10 percent gain in riders, the
Chicago-New Orleans ''City of New Orleans'' route gained 8 percent,
and the Chicago-San Antonio-Los Angeles ''Texas Eagle'' gained 11
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Among short-distance trains, the Sacramento-San Jose-Oakland
''Capitols'' corridor in California had 38 percent more riders than
a year ago, while the Eugene-Portland-Seattle-Vancouver
''Cascades'' route was up 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak took in $1.84 billion during fiscal year 1999, the
highest revenue total in its 28-year history.
</P>
<P>
   But Amtrak has needed more than $22 billion in government
subsidies since its creation in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak has until the end of fiscal year 2002 to wean itself from
federal operating subsidies or face possible liquidation.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Amtrak announced plans to add new passenger
routes and expand into package delivery to help reach financial
self-sufficiency.

<HEADLINE> Grand Canyon Blaze Becomes Wildfire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK, Ariz. (AP) -- A fire that began as a
prescribed burn on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon was raging out
of control Thursday, driven by wind gusts expected to reach 50 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters estimated that 7,000 acres covered in mixed
conifers had burned, but the flames were not believed to have
reached the edge of the canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Officials planned to burn about 1,500 acres within the park, but
winds drove the fire out of control Wednesday. By Thursday, it had
crossed the one paved road out of the park, spread into the Kaibab
National Forest and was working its way northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Some national park employees and visitors in lodges and
campgrounds were evacuated from the North Rim on Wednesday and the
highway was closed, but the fire was not threatening any
structures, park spokesman Tom Pittenger said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is still pretty much wilderness areas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The South Rim of the Grand Canyon, which is much more popular
with visitors, remained open. So far, the wind has been blowing
flames away from the canyon, limiting the amount of smoke and haze,
Pittenger said.
</P>
<P>
   North of the canyon, however, campgrounds were reporting power
outages and lingering smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Park officials were watching the winds closely. They were
worried by forecasts that the wind could shift back toward the
southwest -- and the canyon -- on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 firefighters were at the scene and 180 more were
requested. A helicopter and an airplane arrived Thursday afternoon
and an air tanker to drop fire retardant was on the way, according
to park officials.

<HEADLINE> No CIA Role Seen in Drug Smuggling  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The CIA did not play a role in bringing crack
cocaine into the Los Angeles area in the 1980s, the House
Intelligence Committee concluded in a report Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The report, the latest in a series by investigatory bodies to
exonerate the CIA, said no evidence was found of any conspiracy by
CIA agents to bring drugs into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bottom line: the allegations were false,'' said the committee
chairman, Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Allegations of CIA links to drug dealers surfaced in an August
1996 series published by the San Jose Mercury News, suggesting a
San Francisco Bay area drug ring sold cocaine in Los Angeles and
funneled profits to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels for the better
part of a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ''The committee found no evidence to support the allegations
that CIA agents or assets associated with the Contra movement were
involved in the supply or sale of drugs in the Los Angeles area,''
the committee said in a report.
</P>
<P>
   The committee noted that similar conclusions had been reached in
previous inquires by the CIA's inspector general, the Justice
Department and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the issues raised by the Mercury News articles were
addressed in the investigation,'' said Rep. Julian C. Dixon of
California, the committee's senior Democratic member.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe that the committee's effort, together with the work
of the Justice Department and CIA (inspector general), thoroughly
examined those issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper series also reported that two Nicaraguan cocaine
dealers, Oscar Danilo Blandon and Norwin Meneses, were civilian
leaders of an anti-communist commando group formed and run by the
CIA during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The House committee said it found ''no evidence to support the
allegations.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the paper's top editors was immediately available
Thursday to comment on the report, Mercury News spokeswoman Patty
Wise said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the executive editor of the Mercury News, Jerry Ceppos,
wrote a column that critiqued the series, saying it ''did not meet
our standards'' in key areas. Among other things, Ceppos said the
series often presented only one interpretation of complex evidence,
oversimplified the spread of crack and used graphics and language
''that were open to misinterpretation.''
</P>
<P>
   The articles were followed by a storm of protests in urban areas
such as South Central Los Angeles, with citizens demanding answers
as to whether their communities had been ravaged by drugs to help
pay for a foreign policy goal.
</P>
<P>
   ''The explosive nature of the story and the seriousness with
which we view allegations of complicity in narcotics trafficking by
any official U.S. agency led us to go the extra mile in our
inquiry,'' Goss said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Little Changed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices were little changed Thursday
following the prior day's big gains as investors turned cautious
again before next week's expected interest rate hike by the Federal
Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 3/32
point, or 93} cents per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which
moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.40 percent compared with
late Wednesday's level of 6.42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year Treasury bond also rose 3/32 point with the yield
slipping to 6.14 percent from 6.15 percent a day earlier, according
to Bridge Telerate news service.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, worried that heavy spending is aggravating
inflationary pressures, were heartened by a morning report that
revealed a surprise 0.2 percent drop in retail sales during April.
</P>
<P>
   While it was the first decline in nearly two years, economists
said the report wouldn't be enough to stop the Federal Reserve from
boosting interest rates again next week to slow the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Rising interest rates and inflation make the fixed payoff on
bonds less appealing.
</P>
<P>
   In other trading Thursday, short-term Treasury securities ranged
from unchanged to 1/32 point lower, while intermediate maturities
were unchanged to 1/32 point higher.
</P>
<P>
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills held steady at 6.09 percent
while the discount was unchanged at 5.93 percent. Six-month yields
were 6.41 percent with a discount of 6.14 percent, a gain of 0.01
percentage point. One-year yields were unchanged at 6.29 percent
while the discount held steady at 5.98 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the
discount is the interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, rose to 6.06 percent compared with late Wednesday's 5.94
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds fell 5/32 to 92\. The average yield to
maturity rose to 6.20 percent from 6.19 percent a day earlier.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pledges Support For S.Leone  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Trying to halt ''a return to all-out war'' in
Sierra Leone, President Clinton on Thursday dispatched special
envoy Jesse Jackson to the African nation and directed U.S.
military officials to move faster to ferry in more international
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he spoke Thursday with United Nations Secretary
General Kofi Annan, and they agreed a stronger international
response is necessary ''to restore peace in Sierra Leone and to
prevent a return to all-out civil war. The situation there has been
grave.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We intend to support the commitment West African nations have
made to send additional troops to Sierra Leone to restore peace,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton moved just as the White House fended off criticisms that
his administration is again doing too little, too late for an
African crisis. Clinton said he asked Jackson, his special envoy
for democracy in Africa, to get involved because Jackson has been
active in previous efforts to ''help the people of Sierra Leone
realize their peaceful aspirations.''
</P>
<P>
   National security spokesman P.J. Crowley said he was not aware
of any new deployments to Sierra Leone, ''but we continue to work
through how to best reinforce this force and how to sequence the
arrival of these forces in the coming days and weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has a C-17 cargo plane in Jordan preparing to
airlift equipment for a special forces unit to reinforce Jordanian
troops in the region, Clinton said. Besides Jordan, Bangladesh and
India have committed forces, Crowley said, and the United States
has a logistics team working with Nigeria and other participating
West African nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are engaged deeply with them, to try to help support them
in any way we can,'' Crowley said. ''But this kind of international
response takes time to put together.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations wants to speed deployment of peacekeepers
scheduled to arrive by mid-July, bringing the U.N. force up to its
full strength of 11,100. Annan chastised the world's larger nations
for declining to send their better-trained forces to help the
peacekeepers, who have been overwhelmed in clashes with rebel
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the Sierra Leone crisis ''tragic,'' Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said she and French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vendrine were in contact ''on a very intensive basis'' with
Nigerian President Olesegun Obasanjo about Nigeria's role in
peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're all putting our heads together about how to get the most
effective assistance to Sierra Leone,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Amnesty International USA called on Clinton to state
unequivocally that those who commit atrocities in Sierra Leone will
be prosecuted for war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ''This administration continues to support a broken-down peace
agreement that only adds to the atmosphere of impunity for those
who commit atrocities,'' said executive director William F. Schulz.
''It is time to warn perpetrators and those who support or
facilitate severe human rights violations that they will be held
accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   During his 1998 tour of Africa, Clinton admitted that the United
States, as well as other nations, waited too long to act after the
1994 Rwandan genocide. He called for ''global vigilance'' on deadly
conflicts, saying, ''Never again must we be shy in the face of the
evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowley rejected the suggestion that the United States has
reneged on that pledge in the case of Sierra Leone and other
current African conflicts. He pointed out that Richard Holbrooke,
the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, was in Africa this week
trying to halt fighting between Ethiopia and Eritrea, and Rwanda
and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't let anything slide,'' Crowley said. ''Africa is
very much on our radar scope. We are deeply engaged politically and
we are willing to help militarily to help end this conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States previously committed to flying 700 to 800
Bangladeshi soldiers to Sierra Leone in coming days, and Russia is
to send 110 soldiers and four helicopters. Canada has agreed to
send a plane to ferry 1,800 Indian and Bangladeshi peacekeepers,
and British troops are prepared to defend Freetown's airport so
that reinforcements can arrive and foreign nationals can be
evacuated.

<HEADLINE> Gore's Veep Search Hits the Hill  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER LOVEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The man leading Al Gore's search for a running
mate is casting a wide net on Capitol Hill, meeting with several
Senate Democrats who include possible picks for the No. 2 spot on
the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Former Secretary of State Warren Christopher, in making the
rounds this week and last, has been mostly asking questions such as
whether it was important that Gore choose an elected official and
whether a woman would increase the presumptive Democratic nominee's
chances against his GOP rival George W. Bush, according to Illinois
Sen. Dick Durbin.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ninety-five percent of this had nothing to do with me,'' said
Durbin, who met with Christopher for 20 minutes on Wednesday in his
office.
</P>
<P>
   Durbin, who has been mentioned as possible vice presidential
material, said Christopher's formal demeanor and attorney's
training made it difficult to tell whether the visit was a scouting
mission. The two had never met before. The session, he said, seemed
primarily designed to elicit advice and talk about who would help
Gore win the important Midwestern battleground of Illinois, a swing
state.
</P>
<P>
   Durbin said he suggested to Christopher that Gore consider for
the No. 2 spot Indiana Sen. Evan Bayh, former Maine Sen. George
Mitchell, California Rep. Nancy Pelosi and Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher also met Wednesday with Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa,
according to his spokeswoman Jennifer Frost.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut met with Christopher on May
1, said his spokesman Dan Gerstein.
</P>
<P>
   Others who met with Christopher in recent days include Bayh,
John Kerry of Massachusetts, John Breaux of Louisiana, and Barbara
Boxer of California, said Democratic officials, speaking only on
condition of anonymity. Christopher also reportedly called on Sen.
Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Dianne Feinstein of California.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Douglas Hattaway said he had no information on
Christopher's Hill activities or who is being considered.
</P>
<P>
   ''Warren Christopher is in charge of that process and it's in
his very early stages,'' Hattaway said. ''He's obviously meeting
with a variety of people but I'm not in position to discuss what
he's talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Christopher-Durbin meeting, the former secretary of state
didn't ask the senator if her were interested in the No. 2 spot on
the ticket, but he asked him how he felt seeing his name on
unofficial lists.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really like the job I have,'' said Durbin, who told
Christopher he would be flattered to end up on Gore's short list --
but relieved to see the post go to someone else. ''I'm not seeking
any other position.''
</P>
<P>
   Durbin has never ruled out accepting the vice presidential
nomination if it were offered, but he said he has no ambitions to
higher office. He and his wife prefer to keep the lifestyle they
have that allows to go to the store and other places without
security and publicity, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've really tried to lead an ordinary life,'' Durbin said.
''That would of course change dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   A minor member of Senate Democratic leadership, Durbin has a
reputation as a deft politician, skilled at both behind-the-scenes
wheeling-and-dealing and delivering sharply partisan rhetoric in
public.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most importantly for Gore, Durbin is a Roman Catholic
with a strong political network in a state that carries 22
electoral votes, the nation's sixth-largest cache.

<HEADLINE> In Ocean County, maritime history village prepares for opening  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCKERTON, N.J. (AP) -- In the Hunting Shanty, clerks were busy
folding and stacking the embossed ''Tuckerton Seaport'' golf
shirts, ready for an onslaught of opening-day visitors. At Perrine
Boat Works, boat maker Gus Heinrichs was demonstrating the fine art
of making a sneakbox even sneakier.
</P>
<P>
   Folklorist Steve Warrick walked over clamshell paths from one
seaport building to another Thursday, running errands. Marketing
director Carla Coutts-Miners took a break from her desk in the Sea
Captain's House to take a news crew on a guided tour of the 40-acre
Seaport.
</P>
<P>
   After all, with only two days to go before the grand opening, it
was no time to stand on formality.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're plenty busy,'' said John Gormley, executive director of
the Seaport. ''We're trying to get all the interpreters and
demonstrators assigned to their places, so everyone will know what
they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   What they're doing is bringing the rich history of the decoy
carvers, oystermen and sailors of coastal New Jersey's back bays,
marshes and creeks to life.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the Jersey shore's newest attraction will celebrate
some of its oldest traditions when the Seaport opens its doors to
the public.
</P>
<P>
   ''Barnegat Bay had so much to do with the development of the
Jersey shore as we know it today,'' Gormley said. ''People came
down here to hunt and fish. What we want here is a living history
museum where you can do things, hands-on, where you'll be able to
touch and feel and see things firsthand.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seaport, which consists of 13 cedar wood buildings modeled
after real-life structures, offers a wealth of history and
education. Among the attractions:
</P>
<P>
   --Tucker's Island Lighthouse, a replica of the lighthouse on
Tucker's Island that crashed into the sea on Oct. 12, 1927, a
harbinger of the Island's eventual doom. The Island, a 19th-century
resort, was washed over by the Atlantic Ocean in the 1940s and
exists now only as a sandbar that reveals part of itself during low
tide.
</P>
<P>
   --Skeeters Seafood Cafe and Snack Bar, a replica of a famous
Tucker's Island cottage, which features a snack bar offering local
treats like Barnegat Light Scallops, Cranmer's Crab Cakes and Great
Bay Clam Strips.
</P>
<P>
   --Hurley Conklin's Decoy Shop, which features exhibits about the
duck decoys carved by locals for use in luring ducks during
hunting.
</P>
<P>
   --Perrine Boat Works, where classes will be offered in the art of
''sneakbox'' construction. Sneakboxes are duck-hunting boats,
so-called because they are small and quiet enough to allow hunters
to sneak up on waterfowl. ''If I can teach or show someone how to
do it, they can pick up some cedar and build one of these for
themselves,'' said Heinrichs, 68, of West Creek, who has built more
than 40 of them.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, live decoy carving, painting, quilting, boat
building and basketweaving demonstrations are planned as part of
the opening day festivities. Singer Tom Callinan, who has composed
a special Tuckerton Seaport song, will perform on the grounds.
Raffles, a puppet show and giveaways are also planned.
</P>
<P>
   Townspeople are thrilled about the new addition.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've done a great job over there; it's been a battle for
them to get this far, between the money and the permits and just
getting people to see their vision,'' said John Kumpel, owner of
Tuckerton Emporium, one of many downtown businesses that have
erected signs or bunting for the occasion. ''It's a great thing for
the town.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Questions Medical Marijuana  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CUDAHY, Calif. (AP) -- Al Gore said Thursday that there are
better alternatives to the medical use of marijuana because ''the
science does not show ... that it is the proper medication for
pain.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic presidential candidate, on a visit to a high
school, was asked by a student for his position on whether doctors
should be allowed to prescribe marijuana to treat pain.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that question should be decided ''strictly on the
science.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, the science does not show me or the experts whose
judgment I trust that it is the proper medication for pain and that
there are not better alternatives available in every situation,''
he responded.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president said it was his ''belief and understanding''
that there is ''no reliable evidence'' that marijuana ''is a
superior, effective treatment for pain in any situation where there
is not a better alternative available today.''
</P>
<P>
   ''But if the science ever shows that it is, then that should
determine the outcome,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who mentioned his sister's death from cancer in 1984, said
that it is very important that people suffering through painful
illnesses not be denied pain medication.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, during a forum in New Hampshire, Gore said he was
open to the idea of letting doctors prescribe the illegal drug for
patients to manage pain. He said sister's doctor had prescribed
marijuana for her, but that she refused to take it.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it had worked for her, then I think she should have had the
ability to get her pain relieved that way,'' Gore said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he did not favor legalizing marijuana, ''but where
you have sufficient controls, I think doctors ought to have that
option'' to prescribe it.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton-Gore administration has vigorously opposed marijuana
initiatives on state ballots, saying they would prejudge clinical
research to determine the safety of marijuana.

<HEADLINE> Methodists Keep Anti-Homosexual Stand  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD N. OSTLING
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Rejecting pleas from demonstrators, United
Methodist Church leaders reaffirmed their opposition Thursday to
homosexuality, the ordination of sexually active gays and the
holding of weddinglike ceremonies for same-sex couples.
</P>
<P>
   The decisions raise the prospect of continuing turmoil, church
trials for dissenting clergy and perhaps even a schism in the
denomination, which has 8.4 million U.S. members and 1.2 million
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   During much of the tense, daylong debate, demonstrators stood in
silent protest at the front of the hall. After the third decision
they sang ''We Shall Overcome'' and refused to let the meeting
proceed. Police arrested 27 protesters, including bishops from
Chicago and Albany, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first such disruption of a major American church
assembly over homosexuality, and activists said it would not be the
last.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration came a day after 191 activists were arrested
for blocking a driveway to the convention center where the
Methodist meeting is being held.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators who were taken into custody Thursday were charged
with disruption of a lawful meeting, a misdemeanor punishable by up
to 30 days in jail and a $250 fine.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe this church has broken a covenant with us,'' said
protester Randy Miller of San Francisco as he addressed the
convention on behalf of the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   By taking a stance against homosexuality, the church is
rejecting people who have been Methodists all their lives, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not strangers to this church,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's vote totals were 628-337 to maintain the stand that
''the practice of homosexuality is incompatible with Christian
teaching,'' 640-317 on ordinations and 646-294 to forbid same-sex
ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three votes, the prohibition of same-sex ceremonies looms
as the most troublesome. Hundreds of liberal Methodist clergy have
pledged to disobey this church law. Three trials since 1998 for
ministers who conducted same-sex rites have ended with mixed
results.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot allow church trials to drive some members out of the
denomination,'' said the Rev. Emery Percell of Rockford, Ill. ''I
hesitate to think of the destruction and disruptions in this church
if we go down the route of church trials.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Rev. Robert Hayes, a district superintendent in Houston,
appealed for a firm stand.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over the last few years our denomination has been rocked by
those who would interpret existing language as vague and
unenforceable. If we allow change at this point the church would
have no leverage at all in such cases. This would destroy further
the tapestry that holds our church together,'' Hayes said.
</P>
<P>
   The reaffirmed policy says ''ceremonies that celebrate
homosexual unions shall not be conducted by our ministers and shall
not be conducted in our churches.''
</P>
<P>
   A related ruling from the church's Judicial Council on Thursday
said local Methodist units and individuals may not ''legally
negate, ignore or violate'' sections of church law they disagree
with.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling rejected liberal-conscience claims, most notably from
Bishop Melvin Talbert of Sacramento, Calif., who endorsed the
February acquittal of 67 clergy who led a union ceremony for a
lesbian couple despite the denominational ban. Talbert said local
Methodists' ''commitments to inclusiveness and justice'' take
precedence over national church law.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives have filed separate charges against Talbert over
that statement.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the Judicial Council ruling is unclear, because
Methodist rules still give the local units full control of clergy
discipline. Conservatives are furious that clergy in California
were able to break the same-sex ban with impunity.

<HEADLINE> GOP Pledge Patient Rights Progress  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican lawmakers insisted Thursday they
are making progress on a patients' rights bill but set no deadline
for completing work despite complaints by President Clinton about
the slow pace.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have spent hundreds of hours to put together a bill,'' Sen.
Don Nickles, R-Okla., said after he and 10 colleagues met for an
hour with Clinton at the White House. ''We have made good progress
despite what some may think.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats cited ''painfully slow'' progress and sought
unsuccessfully for a Memorial Day deadline to complete work on the
most contentious issues remaining: how many Americans the bill
would cover and whether patients would gain the right to sue health
plans if they are harmed when plans deny medical coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called the meeting to get an update on negotiations on
the measure, which the administration wants wrapped up before
lawmakers' break for the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are here to determine what the issues are and what the
processes are to resolve them,'' Clinton said as the meeting began.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would give millions the right to appeal
decisions by health maintenance organizations, offer easier access
to specialists and provide other guarantees when dealing with HMOs
and other health plans.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton favors the House-passed version, which would cover 161
million Americans with private insurance and expand patients' right
to sue. The Senate passed a Republican-crafted bill that would
apply to 55 million Americans whose health plans are not regulated
by states. The Senate version does not expand the right to sue.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no real substance on where we could compromise,''
said Chris Jennings, Clinton's health policy adviser, who attended
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   After 11 weeks of negotiations, lawmakers working to combine the
two bills have agreed on a few provisions, such as letting people
use hospitals not in their plans for emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, R-Mass., said he hoped Thursday's meeting
with Clinton would help get the negotiations ''out of the ditch.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Progress has been painfully slow,'' Kennedy said, adding that
Congress has just 30 days to 40 days to complete its work.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers agreed that time was running out to finish the bill
and told Clinton they would begin meetings in the next few days to
reach a compromise on coverage and the right to sue. Kennedy
suggested a Memorial Day deadline to complete work on those issues,
but Nickles was not ready to set a date, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, who met with Clinton on Wednesday
night to discuss the HMO issue, said negotiators were making ''slow
and steady progress.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very close to completing a balanced bill, one that will
address the issue of the uninsured as it addresses the issue of
accountability,'' the Illinois Republican said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Lobbyists Come Out for Bush  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lobbyists for some of America's biggest
corporations -- including General Motors, McDonald's and AT&AMP;T -- have
signed up to host a Washington fund-raiser for George W. Bush later
this month.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-member host committee for the $1,000-per-person event May
22 also includes lobbyists for Microsoft, which is embroiled in an
antitrust suit with the federal government, and Time Warner, which
is awaiting government approval for a merger with America Online.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also includes lobbyists for credit card issuer
Visa, which supports overhauling bankruptcy laws; the tobacco
industry, which opposes giving the Food and Drug Administration the
authority to regulate tobacco as a drug; and the American
Association of Health Plans, which is fighting legislation to allow
patients to sue managed care health organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign hopes to raise $350,000 to $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the host committee members are familiar names: former
Reps. Bill Paxon and Susan Molinari; former Republican National
Committee chairman Haley Barbour; and Daniel Meyer, former chief of
staff to former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Others are veterans of the administration of Bush's father,
former President Bush. They include former White House counsel C.
Boyden Gray; former U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills; and
former White House political director Ron Kaufman.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole name of the game is influence and ability to have
your telephone calls returned,'' said Larry Makinson, executive
director of the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group
that studies money and campaigns. ''Particularly when you're
dealing with a $1,000 limit, the power doesn't accrue to the donors
but the people who can corral large blocks of them. These guys are
setting themselves up to be on the list of people the next
president is grateful to.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokesman Scott McClellan said the Texas governor
has attracted widespread support from across the country, not just
from Washington lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   ''We appreciate the broad-based support Governor Bush is
receiving to help spread his bipartisan message of strengthening
Social Security, improving our schools and letting working families
keep more of what they earn to save and invest,'' McClellan said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats accused Bush of siding with special interests against
the public interest.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once again, instead of standing up for the American people and
urging Congress to act now on a real patients' bill of rights,
class-size reduction and gun safety initiatives, George Bush is
sitting down with the people who dedicate their careers to stopping
America's working families' agenda from passing,'' Democratic
National Committee spokeswoman Jenny Backus said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush raised $1 million at a Washington fund-raiser last June.
The host committee for that event also was populated with
lobbyists, including Paxon, Barbour and former House Appropriations
Committee Chairman Bob Livingston.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Honors Teacher of the Year  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton presented a California
English instructor the Teacher of the Year award on Thursday,
saying her style was a gentle version of the dogmatic law professor
in the movie ''The Paper Chase.''
</P>
<P>
   The award was given to Marilyn Jachetti Whirry, 65, who teaches
seniors dubbed ''Whirry-ites'' at Mira Costa High School in
Manhattan Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ''Her teaching style, I understand, is like a softer, more
nurturing version of Professor Kingsfield in 'The Paper Chase,'''
Clinton said in the Rose Garden ceremony. ''She paces the room,
posing questions to each student, responding to each answer with
still more questions, digging deeper and deeper into the toughest
texts until their meanings are revealed.''
</P>
<P>
   This year is the 50th anniversary of the National Teacher of the
Year program, sponsored by the Council of Chief State School
Officers and Scholastic Magazine. The winner is chosen from among
the state teachers of the year by a national selection committee
representing national education groups.
</P>
<P>
   Whirry used the opportunity to call for better recruitment and
retention of well-educated teachers for the future. ''We must
instill in our students a passion, a passion about the world,'' she
said. ''This passion puts us in touch with the dizziness that comes
from a new idea, the excitement that comes from a new challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she played schoolmarm, telling the president and the
audience to, ''Please be seated'' because she wasn't finished
speaking. Like a scolded student, Clinton sat back down.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll let Mr. Clinton respond in a minute,'' she said after
presenting him with an honorary teacher of the year award and
thanking him for his support of teachers during his presidency.

<HEADLINE> EPA Unveils Toxic Release Report  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hardrock mining companies and electric power
plants accounted for nearly two-thirds of the 7.3 billion pounds of
toxic chemicals released into the environment by industry in 1998,
the Environmental Protection Agency said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in its 11 years, the annual Toxic Release
Inventory report included releases from gold, copper and other
hardrock mining as well as the electric utility industry. These
additions were required by an executive order in 1997 from
President Clinton to expand the reporting scope.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the expansion appears -- at least on paper -- to be
good news for Texas, where toxic air pollution has become an issue
in the presidential race between Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   With the addition of the mining industry, Texas no longer stands
as the state with the highest volume of toxic emissions, replaced
by four mining states: Nevada, 1.3 billion pounds; Arizona, 1.1
billion pounds; Utah, 459 million pounds; and Alaska, 306 million
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Texas still leads the original reporting industries, pouring 260
million pounds of toxic chemicals into the environment, about 40
percent into the air. The state also is second in releases into the
air and third in releases into the water.
</P>
<P>
   That information prompted, within hours of the release of the
EPA's report, a statement from Gore's campaign declaring that
''under George W. Bush Texas remains one of the most polluted
states in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Bartlett, a Bush campaign spokesman, said ''one thing Al
Gore fails to point out is that Texas still leads the nation in
reducing toxic releases.'' Bartlett said that the state cut its
toxic emissions by 43 million pounds, or 14 percent from 1995 to
1998, the latest reporting year, more than the rest of the country
combined. Bush campaign officials also have said that it is only
expected the state would have high releases because of its large
concentration of chemical plants.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA data reflect releases in 1998 and agency officials
cautioned the information should be used as a guide and not
necessarily an indicator of health risk because the report does not
provide information on exposure or specific toxicity of the
high-volume chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Also the reports from 23,487 facilities around the country
include large amounts of chemical releases that are classified as
going into the environment, but are released within plant or mining
site boundaries. That is especially the case in releases reported
by the mining companies. Overall on-site releases accounted for 94
percent of the total 7.3 billion pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists maintain that even when some of the chemicals
are kept on site, eventually some get into the air or into
groundwater or otherwise into the environment.
</P>
<P>
   EPA Administrator Carol Browner said the report is a valuable
''right to know'' tool for the public to gauge potential healthy
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA said that hard rock mining companies released 3.5
billion pounds of chemicals into the air, land and water, although
all but about 1.3 million pounds was kept on the mine sites.
Electric utilities dumped more than 1.1 billion pounds, about 70
percent of it into the air through the power plant smokestacks,
mostly coal-burning plants, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers dwarfed releases by the broad section of industry
that for years have been required to make annual reports. For
example, chemical plants, the previous leader, reported 737 million
pounds of releases in 1998. In all, the original industries
released nearly 2.4 billion pounds of toxic materials.
</P>
<P>
   This year's report cannot easily be compared with previous
reports because of the addition of the seven new industry sectors.
But the EPA said among the original industry sectors, toxic
releases have declined by 45 percent over 11 years. Overall
releases also were down slightly from the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Many Undecided on China Trade Bill  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The administration's point man on China
bluntly warned Republicans on Thursday that they will have to
accept a human rights monitoring panel to win passage of landmark
trade legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce Secretary William Daley said he believed that chances
for congressional approval of permanent normal trade relations with
China were ''slim to none'' without legislation to create a
congressional-executive commission to monitor China's human rights
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, President Clinton warned members of his own party
that Democrats would be hurt if their opposition killed the
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would make it possible for people to question whether the
Democrats were running away from our global responsibilities,''
Clinton said in a National Public Radio interview.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for a watchdog commission has been put forward by Reps.
Sander Levin, D-Mich., and Doug Bereuter, R-Neb, although some
Republicans have questioned the need for such a panel.
</P>
<P>
   The commission would consist of members appointed by Congress
and the White House and would issue an annual report to Congress on
China's performance on human rights issues. It could recommend
economic sanctions against China outside of the trade area, such as
withholding U.S. loans.
</P>
<P>
   The commission report would replace the current annual
congressional vote on China's trade status with the United States.
That vote has been used as leverage to apply pressure to China on a
range of issues from human rights to religious freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and China reached agreement last
November on a measure to lower China's high trade barriers to
American products in return for U.S. support for China's entry into
the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   However, for American exporters to gain the benefits, Congress
must grant China permanent normal trade relations with the United
States, eliminating the annual review.
</P>
<P>
   The administration, which sees this as one of the biggest items
left on Clinton's final year agenda, continued efforts Thursday to
round up stray votes, dispatching members of the Cabinet to meet
with undecided lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are hoping to get between 140 and 145 votes, meaning
that Democrats will have to produce close to 80 votes to get the
218 needed for a House victory when the vote comes up the week of
May 22. Senate passage is considered more assured
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told reporters Thursday that he believed Majority Whip
Tom DeLay, R-Texas, would come up with the needed GOP votes despite
complaints from DeLay that Republican support was proving to be
shallower than first thought.
</P>
<P>
   ''I noticed that he's quite effective at getting votes when the
time comes, sometimes when I like it and sometimes when I don't,''
Clinton said of DeLay, one of the leaders of the House impeachment
effort in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we'll get there. We've just got a lot of hard work to
do,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president was traveling on Friday to the districts of Reps.
Thomas Sawyer, D-Ohio, who is undecided, and David Minge, D-Minn.,
who is backing the measure, to talk about how the China deal will
benefit U.S. manufacturing companies and farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told the House Banking
Committee on Thursday that it would be ''catastrophic'' for
American banks, securities firms and insurance companies if the
trade bill did not pass because their competitors would be able to
enter China's huge market and they would not.
</P>
<P>
   Summers also indicated that the administration was still in
discussions on what changes could be made to the Levin-Bereuter
commission proposal in order to attract more votes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are receptive to ideas that make good sense and can garner
bipartisan support,'' Summers said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John LaFalce, D-N.Y., one of the undecided Democrats, said
during the hearing that he would not be able to commit until
Republican House leaders specified what accompanying legislation
they will allow the House to vote on.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Bernard Sanders, I-Vt., said he viewed the proposal as
a way to benefit American corporations by making it easier for them
to move jobs to China to take advantage of cheap labor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Trade should represent the best interests of the American
people and not just corporate greed,'' Sanders told Summers.

<HEADLINE> Mom of Rail Killer Suspect Testifies  </HEADLINE>
By C. BRYSON HULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- The sister of admitted serial killer Angel
Maturino Resendiz testified Thursday she knew he could face the
death penalty before he turned himself in to U.S. authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The defense has argued the Mexican drifter's family was given
false promises that Maturino Resendiz would not be subject to the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   But under cross examination from prosecutor Devon Anderson,
Manuela Maturino Karkiewicz acknowledged the topic of the death
penalty was broached in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Karkiewicz brokered a deal with Texas Ranger Sgt. Drew Carter
that led Maturino Resendiz to turn himself in on the American side
of an international bridge spanning El Paso and Ciudad Juarez,
Mexico, on July 13.
</P>
<P>
   Karkiewicz initially said the negotiations only covered jail
visitation rights for the family, a guarantee of psychiatric help
and a promise of ''humane treatment,'' which the defense has
construed as no death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   But she acknowledged under cross examination that she asked
Carter about the death penalty the night before Maturino Resendiz
surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said 'It's not up to us, it's up to the jury,''' Karkiewicz
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''So you knew that going in, didn't you,'' Anderson asked.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes,'' Karkiewicz replied.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendiz, 40, has admitted to nine killings from
1997-99 -- six in Texas, two in Illinois and one in Kentucky. He is
being tried for the death of Houston-area physician Dr. Claudia
Benton.
</P>
<P>
   The rail-riding migrant worker faces death by injection if found
guilty of raping, stabbing and bludgeoning Benton during a Dec. 18,
1998, break-in at her home in a Houston suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendiz pleaded innocent by reason of insanity.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys questioned Dr. Bruce Cohen, a forensic
psychiatrist who examined Maturino Resendiz' background and is the
centerpiece witness of the insanity defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the time of that offense, as a result of schizophrenia, he
did not know that his conduct was wrong,'' Cohen testified.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendiz said he was propelled by an ''evil force,'' to
enter the houses where he killed, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   ''In each case, there was something that led to a feeling of
certainty, a conviction that he had been sent to this house to do
what he needed to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mirroring earlier testimony by a defense psychologist, Cohen
said drug abuse -- glue sniffing -- and head injuries could have
played a role in the development of Maturino Resendiz'
schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, Maturino Resendiz' mother, Virginia Maturino
Resendiz, testified her son was dropped on his head right after he
was born.
</P>
<P>
   ''Angel was born, and he did hit himself on his head. He was
very purple,'' she said through an interpreter, describing her
son's delivery at the hands of a midwife.
</P>
<P>
   She also recalled how her son was smashed in the head with a
rock by other students when he was in his early teens and witnessed
her being attacked by men with knives on two occasions. Cohen said
Maturino Resendiz was twice raped by a neighborhood man when he was
8.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Autopsy Report Is Blocked  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN K. PAULSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- A Colorado appeals court Thursday blocked the
release of the autopsy report on Columbine High gunman Dylan
Klebold at his parents' request.
</P>
<P>
   The three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals rejected arguments
by news organizations that release of the report would not harm the
community.
</P>
<P>
   ''In our view, the trial court properly determined that the
overwhelming grief caused by the nature and extent of this tragedy
constituted an extraordinary situation,'' the court said.
</P>
<P>
   The Klebolds' lawyers had no immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
   Media attorney Tom Kelley said he was disappointed. He said
autopsy reports often cause grief but are considered public records
under law.
</P>
<P>
   In June, District Judge Henry Nieto sealed the autopsy reports
for all 15 victims of the shooting rampage, including the gunmen,
Klebold and Eric Harris, who committed suicide. He ruled the
reports would harm the public interest by prolonging the families'
grief.
</P>
<P>
   When The Denver Rocky Mountain News and The Denver Post sued to
have the gunmen's reports released, Nieto relented, pending an
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The Harris report was made public because his parents did not
contest its release. The coroner found that Harris, 18, died of of
wounds consistent with a self-inflicted shotgun blast to the roof
of the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, a Jefferson County District Court judge ordered
911 tapes recorded during the shootings to be edited and released
to the parents of Harris and Klebold and the parents of some of the
victims.
</P>
<P>
   The victims' parents sought the tapes from the sheriff's
department to gather information in support of their lawsuit
against the department, which they allege could have prevented the
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Although the order from judge R. Brooke Jackson does not release
the tapes to the public, the he noted the recipients are not
restricted in what they can do with them.
</P>
<P>
   The 22 tapes, each about 90 minutes long, range from an early
call about a diversionary bomb placed on a street to later calls
inside the school and include conversations from law enforcement,
victims and the assailants.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ordered names, addresses and telephone numbers edited
out, as well as a sequence of conversations recorded from an open
telephone line in the library, where most of the deaths and
injuries occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said that recording, which was technologically
enhanced by the FBI, picks up details that could cause ''a degree
of anguish for the surviving victims and victim families ... that
outweighs the public interest in disclosure.''

<HEADLINE> Insanity plea accepted from former success story  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- A law professor -- once celebrated for
overcoming schizophrenia -- killed his pregnant fiancee because he
thought she was ''a nonhuman impostor'' conspiring to hospitalize
him for torture, experimentation and death.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, according to psychiatric reports released
Thursday, were summarized in court as prosecutors accepted Michael
Laudor's insanity plea, conceding that no jury would convict him of
murder in the face of three doctors' unanimous conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   But the victim's mother and sister, given the rare opportunity
to speak in court in connection with an insanity case, railed
against the idea that Laudor was not responsible for the death of
Caroline Costello.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is horrifying for us to accept that our daughter was
murdered by someone she loved and trusted,'' said Marilyn Costello,
the victim's mother. ''It is horrifying for us to accept that she
died all alone, bleeding, terrified and in pain. ... Michael Laudor
alone must bear the responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Laudor reddened and closed his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The victim's sister, Joyce Costello, said, ''Regardless of
whether he is or was insane, Michael knew he had done something to
hurt Carrie and he knew enough to run. He deserves to be locked up
forever and never released, for who's to say that once released, he
won't kill somebody else?''
</P>
<P>
   State Supreme Court Justice Daniel Angiolillo, taking Laudor's
plea of not responsible by means of mental defect, asked him, ''Do
you understand that you killed Caroline Costello by stabbing her?''
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes, sir,'' Laudor replied.
</P>
<P>
   Costello, 37, was found slashed to death on June 17, 1998, in
the kitchen of the apartment she shared with Laudor in
Hastings-on-Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Barbara Egenhauser said bloody knives were found in
the kitchen and bathroom, along with Band-Aid wrappings apparently
used by Laudor for cuts he suffered on his hands during the
killing.
</P>
<P>
   The victim's mother looked down and leaned against her husband.
He held her hand tightly.
</P>
<P>
   Laudor, now 37, had won some fame for succeeding as a Yale Law
School graduate and instructor despite his schizophrenia. He had
sold book and movie rights to his story and was considered a role
model for victims who control schizophrenia through medication.
</P>
<P>
   But at some point after the death of his father in 1997, his
condition deteriorated and he stopped taking his medication,
apparently believing it to be part of a conspiracy against him, the
prosecutor said. Laudor believed he was being monitored or was
receiving messages from televisions and roadside transmitters.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the killing, Costello stayed home from work to try
to help. Laudor's mother and doctor arranged for a visit from a
crisis intervention team from the Westchester County Medical
Center. But that impending visit, according to one psychiatric
report, precipitated the killing because Laudor thought he would be
tortured and lobotomized.
</P>
<P>
   He called his mother and doctor, telling them ''he had killed
Carrie or a windup doll,'' Egenhauser said. They called police, who
found Costello's body and tracked Laudor to the campus of Cornell
University in Ithaca.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks after the killing, his lawyer said Laudor still did
not realize that Miss Costello was dead. Doctors originally found
him unfit to stand trial, then reversed that decision a year later.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution, anticipating an insanity defense, hired
forensic psychiatrist Park Dietz, who Egenhauser said was ''known
for having a high threshold'' for insanity. But Dietz agreed with
the defense psychiatrists that Laudor believed his fiancee was ''a
nonperson, a robot or a doll ... planning to kill or torture him.''
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Jeanine Pirro, saying she had no choice but to
accept the insanity plea, complained about ''a criminal justice
system that allows a psychiatrist to decide whether an individual
stands trial.'' She said psychiatric reports should be considered
only at sentencing, after ''it is decided in a courtroom who
committed a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge ordered a new mental evaluation to help determine what
kind of treatment Laudor should now receive. Laudor told the judge
he was expecting to be returned to the Mid-Hudson Forensic
Psychiatric Center in New Hampton, where he has been treated for
some time.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules governing insanity pleas, if the state Office of
Mental Health and the court ever agreed that Laudor was no longer a
danger to himself or others, he could eventually be released.
</P>
<P>
   That rarely happens in New York, lawyers said.

<HEADLINE> Ohio Supreme Court Zaps School Plan  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW WELSH-HUGGINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Ohio's system of paying for schools
remains unconstitutional despite lawmakers' attempts to fix it, the
state Supreme Court ruled Thursday, giving the state more time to
come up with a solution to the nearly decade-old case.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Alice Robie Resnick said the state should be given the
additional time because of progress made by the governor and
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ''We acknowledge the effort that has been made and that a good
faith attempt to comply with the constitutional requirements has
been mounted, but even more is required,'' Resnick wrote. ''The
process must continue.''
</P>
<P>
   As in March 1997, the court found that an overreliance on local
property taxes remains the ''most glaring weakness'' in the state's
attempts to establish a fairer funding system, Resnick said.
</P>
<P>
   Resnick, as part of a 4-3 majority, ordered more arguments in
June 2001, when lawmakers must address several issues, including
the reliance on property taxes as the primary means to finance
schools, the way new school buildings are paid for and the use of
an emergency fund for schools in financial trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bob Taft said Thursday he appreciated the recognition of
improvements made since the court's original decision. He had no
further comment.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's decision was the latest development in a case that
dates to December 1991, when the Ohio Coalition for Equity &AMP;
Adequacy of School Funding sued in Perry County Common Pleas Court
on behalf of the Northern Local School District and others.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Jo Ann Davidson, a Republican, said she and Senate
President Richard Finan likely would appoint a joint House-Senate
committee this month to study the court's concerns and possible
legislative remedies. Lawmakers are planning to begin their summer
recess on May 25.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Espy of Columbus, a Democratic leader in the Senate, said
lawmakers should skip their summer recess to address the court's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Taft and Republican leaders contend that the state has drafted a
successful plan to pay for schools.
</P>
<P>
   The court ordered the Legislature to address the schools'
undiminished reliance on local property taxes, which vary widely
from county to county, giving wealthier districts better schools
than poorer ones. In Ohio, 70 percent of all property taxes are
allocated to public schools and that money has been the biggest
source of school funding.
</P>
<P>
   William Phillis, director of the group that filed the school
funding lawsuit, on Thursday asked the state to work with the
coalition to define what constitutes a thorough and efficient
system and how much achieving it would cost.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're willing to help, we're willing to cheerlead, we're
willing to do anything to move this whole scenario forward,''
Phillis said.

<HEADLINE> EgyptAir Crew Overpowers Hijacker  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- An Egyptian man claiming a jar of hair gel
was a bomb tried Thursday to hijack an EgyptAir plane but was
overpowered by the crew, airport officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 233 was on its way from Cairo to the popular southern
tourist city of Aswan when Shaaban Ali tried to enter the cockpit,
the officials said. When the plane landed in Aswan, Ali was handed
over to police.
</P>
<P>
   EgyptAir Chairman Mohammed Fahim Rayan said 19 passengers,
including Ali, were aboard the Airbus 321. Earlier in the day,
airport officials had said 165 people were on board.
</P>
<P>
   ''The hijacker tried to storm the cockpit while carrying a jar
of gel, but since the door of the cockpit was locked according to
regulations, he was not able to enter. Then, crew members were able
to overpower him and handed him over to security men at Aswan
Airport,'' Rayan said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have learned that Ali is a 34-year-old wall
painter, according to Transportation Minister Ibrahim el-Dimeiri.
</P>
<P>
   ''He doesn't belong to any organizations, doesn't have political
affiliations and didn't have any weapon on him'' the Middle East
News Agency quoted el-Demeiri as saying.
</P>
<P>
   On returning to Cairo, Capt. Bassem Badr el-Din told a news
conference that Ali told the head flight attendant that he wanted
to go to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Ali was being questioned in Aswan, 500 miles south of Cairo,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 19, an EgyptAir flight was commandeered between
Istanbul, Turkey, and Cairo. Fathallah Khalaf, an Egyptian,
apparently poked a pen into the neck of a crew member and forced
the plane to fly to Germany, where he was overpowered and detained.
None of the 46 passengers on board was harmed.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- The new head of the New York
Archdiocese is described as friendly and down-to-earth but a
staunch defender of the Roman Catholic Church's conservative
positions on issues such as abortion and homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Edward M. Egan, 68, spent two decades in Rome, teaching
church law and serving on a church court that rules on annulments
of marriages, among other things. In the early 1980s he spent a
summer at the side of Pope John Paul II, reviewing the draft of a
new code of canon law.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he was equally comfortable in more casual settings.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Ruane, now a Bridgeport lawyer, was an altar boy at Egan's
1988 installation as bishop and later traveled with him throughout
the diocese. He recalled how Egan showed a sense of humor when the
teen-age boys grew restless in the back of the church.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wasn't afraid to raise an eyebrow or smirk along with us,''
Ruane said.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican announced Thursday that Egan would replace Cardinal
John O'Connor, who died of a brain tumor last week at age 80.
Egan's promotion from bishop of Bridgeport, a diocese with 367,000
Catholics, to archbishop of New York, which has 2.4 million, will
be formalized June 19 at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York.
</P>
<P>
   A friend from Egan's college days in Rome summed up the new
archbishop as ''affable but very serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Monsignor Roger Roensch, director of the office in Rome that
assists American visitors to the Vatican, said Egan quickly stood
out as a brilliant student because of his fluency in Latin. In
those days, seminary classes were entirely taught in that ancient
language.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all expected big things of him,'' Roensch said.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Oak Park, Ill., Egan was ordained in Rome in 1957. He
spent 22 years there as a professor of canon law at the Gregorian
University and as a judge in the Sacred Roman Rota. He has also
worked in the Chicago and New York archdioceses.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, he headed up education programs. Nora Murphy, a
spokeswoman for the parochial schools there, said she was impressed
by Egan's commitment to Catholic education.
</P>
<P>
   ''He made that quite clear to us -- that he wanted strong
Catholic schools, quality schools, that we were here to serve them
and to help them grow,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Egan hews close to church teachings on social issues. In 1997 he
canceled a weekend conference for Catholic parents of gays and
lesbians that had been scheduled at a diocesan retreat house.
</P>
<P>
   The organizers were a nun and a priest whose ministry to
homosexuals had placed them at odds with the Vatican. The event was
held at another location in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Also in 1997, Egan, O'Connor, several other bishops and numerous
religious and academic officials signed a declaration of
''Christian conscience and citizenship.''
</P>
<P>
   The declaration called for ''ordered liberty'' based on moral
truth, saying that the consequences of ''disordered liberty ... are
by now painfully familiar'' -- including abortion, suicide, divorce
and drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The statement also strongly condemned the Supreme Court, which
it said had begun considering any law predicated upon Christian
morality as automatically unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Pieczynski, a spokeswoman for Call to Action, a
Chicago-based group seeking reforms in the Catholic church, called
Egan conservative and legalistic -- yet ''very personable.''
</P>
<P>
   Tall and stately with a stentorian voice, the bishop is a fine
speaker who often dispenses with a microphone. His regular column
in the diocesan newspaper is frequently picked up in Connecticut's
secular papers.
</P>
<P>
   Egan's diocese included both the poor city of Bridgeport and the
wealthy New York City suburbs of Greenwich, New Canaan and Darien.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Joseph Ehrenkranz, executive director of the Center for
Christian-Jewish Understanding at Sacred Heart University in
Fairfield, where Egan sits on the board of directors, called Egan a
strong leader who has reached out to diverse populations such as
New York's.
</P>
<P>
   While in Bridgeport, Egan had to deal with more than two dozen
lawsuits accusing priests of molesting children from the 1960s
through the 1990s. He triggered controversy by asserting in
videotaped testimony in one of those cases that priests were
independent contractors who work for individual parishes, not the
diocese.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has never offered counseling or any type of apology for the
horrific events that went on with Bridgeport diocesan priests,''
said Cindy Robinson, an attorney for the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Drohan, a spokesman for Egan, said the bishop has repeatedly
condemned sexual abuse by priests. ''There is no example in the
past when that hasn't been true,'' Drohan said.
</P>
<P>
   Egan also reorganized diocesan schools and was a successful
fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think they could pick anybody better,'' said
Bridgeport parishioner Stephen Salmon, a math and special education
teacher in the city schools. ''There's a great spirituality about
him and a great sense of faith.''

<HEADLINE> Texas Executes Convicted Killer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A man who shot his ex-girlfriend and a
companion to death in a jealous rage in 1985 was executed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lee McBride, 38, was convicted of gunning down two
18-year-olds from Fort Worth, ex-girlfriend Christian Fisher and
James Holzer. He insisted the shootings were in the heat of passion
and did not amount to capital murder.
</P>
<P>
   ''God bless all of you,'' he said before his execution. As the
lethal drugs began taking effect, he said: ''Pretty cool, I feel it
in the back of my throat. Bye.''
</P>
<P>
   McBride, a bartender in a Lubbock country club, dated Fisher for
about 11 months before she broke up with him. He lured the Texas
Tech student to his house under the pretense of giving her a
painting he said was equal to money he owed her. He concluded the
conversation by saying: ''If I can't have you, nobody will.''
</P>
<P>
   Her friends worried about her and accompanied her in two cars to
McBride's home. Holzer was with Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   She knocked on the door but got no answer. As she was returning
to her car, McBride emerged wearing camouflage clothing and
carrying a semi-automatic rifle. He shot Fisher at least 10 times
and Holzer nine times.

<HEADLINE> Poor Final Play Haunts Suns  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- A no-call against Shaquille O'Neal and a lousy
last-second play still haunted the Phoenix Suns on Thursday as they
tried to turn their attention to Game 3 against the Los Angeles
Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers are up 2-0 as the best-of-seven Western Conference
semifinals switches to Phoenix for games Friday night and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Hardaway was still shaking his head that no foul was
called against O'Neal on the Suns' next-to-last possession in
Wednesday night's 97-96 loss in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've gone over in my mind a million times what would have
happened if they'd call that foul or if I'd taken the baseline when
I had it,'' Hardaway said.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns were leading 96-95 when Hardaway drove to the basket
and O'Neal, his old teammate in Orlando, got in his way. Hardaway
said O'Neal hit him in the shoulder, causing him to lose control of
the ball as he shot.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the MVP. He just had received the trophy before the
game,'' Hardaway said. ''There was a lot of pressure on the refs
not to make that call even though it was a foul. Hopefully we'll
get that call when we're here at home.''
</P>
<P>
   The foul wasn't flagrant enough for the officials to make it in
front of the pro-Laker crowd at that point in the game, Hardaway
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the first quarter, that call would be made, easy,''
Hardaway said. But late in the game, ''you'd have to get your head
taken off or knocked to the floor or something so the fans won't
react to it if they call it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Suns coach Scott Skiles said videotape showed it was obviously a
foul.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's frustrating, but all year long we've had a hard time
getting to the foul line for whatever reason,'' Skiles said.
''Maybe that reputation is hurting us or something. That's clearly
a foul, but it's just one of those things.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Lakers can point to plays that clearly are fouls on us.
It's not like there's a conspiracy or anything. It was just, in my
opinion, a call that should have been called and was missed.''
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant won the game with a 15-footer under tight defense
with 2.6 seconds to go. After a timeout, the Suns failed to get a
good shot and settled for Hardaway's desperation attempt at the
buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   Skiles said he was up most of the night thinking about what
might have been.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel like we deserved to win the game,'' Skiles said. ''I
feel really bad for the guys. I also felt bad, most of the night
actually, about the last play with 2.6 seconds left. We could have
got something better than that, and that's my responsibility. So I
felt I had a hand in the outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, the Lakers worked out Thursday before heading
for Phoenix. They blamed themselves for almost losing Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ''It probably gave them a lot of confidence,'' O'Neal said.
''But like I keep saying, it wasn't what they did. It was what we
didn't do.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant said the Lakers should have learned something from their
poor fourth quarter Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a pretty horrible game,'' he said. ''At certain
stretches, we played well, then we dropped off and let them get
back in the game. Hopefully it shook us up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns came to life with a pressing defense, but Lakers coach
Phil Jackson said many of his team's mistakes were self-inflicted.
</P>
<P>
   ''Three of the turnovers we had were completely unforced,''
Jackson said. ''Yes, their pressure defense activated them, got
them motivated. Can they do it for 48 minutes?''
</P>
<P>
   No they can't, Skiles said, ''We have to pick our spots.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers are looking for their first playoff road victory
after losing twice at Sacramento in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as we can get one of these games, we'll be happy,''
O'Neal said. ''If we can get two of the games, it will be great.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix guard Jason Kidd, who played 43 minutes with no ill
effects on his surgically repaired left ankle, said he felt fine,
but a little tired, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm moving today, so instead of lifting weights, I'm lifting
boxes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Skiles said the strong fourth quarter should provide some
momentum for his team.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly we were right there, and if a phenomenal player
wouldn't have made a great play, we would have won the game,''
Skiles said. ''Kobe made a great, great shot. Hopefully our guys
take something out of that.
</P>
<P>
   ''NBA basketball is not a place where you take away moral
victories. You win or you lose. It's as simple as that. We lost and
yet the guys have a real positive feeling this morning. I think the
guys in that locker room believe and feel that they're going to win
the series.''

<HEADLINE> Dumps to duffers: Florida company plans golf courses atop landfills </HEADLINE>
By WAYNE PARRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH ARLINGTON, N.J. (AP) -- High atop stinking, wind-swept
garbage heaps, a Florida company plans to build a hotel, marina,
office space and lavish golf courses with the Manhattan skyline
providing a spectacular backdrop to an ambitious environmental
reclamation project.
</P>
<P>
   Bergen County officials say the plan would transform six
landfills, five of which are inactive, into a verdant, moneymaking
enterprise that also would relieve taxpayers of the burden of
cleaning up the old dump sites.
</P>
<P>
   But the project could interfere with New York City's plan to
shut down the massive Fresh Kills Landfill on Staten Island earlier
than planned if a trash transfer station it had hoped to use in
North Arlington is closed as part of the golf course plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Hackensack Meadowlands Development Commission is close to an
agreement with Tampa, Fla.-based EnCap Golf L.L.C. to transform
dump sites in North Arlington, Rutherford, and Lyndhurst into
championship-caliber golf courses with as many as 72 holes, a
hotel, marina and office building. Neither the commission nor the
company could provide a cost estimate for the project.
</P>
<P>
   EnCap, a 3-year-old partnership specializing in building golf
courses atop old landfills or polluted industrial sites, would
assume all the costs of cleaning up and capping the landfills,
which would save taxpayers tens of millions of dollars, said
development commission Executive Director Alan Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'd be getting out of the garbage business and into the
golf-leasing business,'' he said. ''This would be one of the
largest landfill closure efforts ever in New Jersey, and would turn
a wasteland into a green, verdant area of open space and
recreation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We look forward to the day when people driving through the
area on the New Jersey Turnpike can look left and right, and
instead of seeing landfills, they'll see beautiful green golf
courses,'' Steinberg said. ''I think this is the biggest win-win
project I've seen in all my years in government.''
</P>
<P>
   EnCap would use dredge spoils dug up from the bottom of New York
Harbor to cap the landfills. The company would build a processing
facility along the Hackensack River to clean contaminants out of
the muck, and use the sanitized remains to seal off the landfills,
which have been oozing toxins into area groundwater for decades.
The sites are the Rutherford and Lyndhurst landfills, the Avon
landfill in Lyndhurst, a dumping site known as ''1-E'' in North
Arlington, the Kingsland Landfill, which straddles North Arlington
and Lyndhurst, and the Erie landfill in North Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is taking material that's problematic for the river and
processing it so that it can have a positive use,'' said Cynthia
Zipf, executive director of the Clean Ocean Action environmental
group at Sandy Hook. ''It's an economic investment in the region
where there's now an economic and public-health liability.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal needs several layers of approval, including permits
from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to fill in contaminated
wetlands along the perimeter of the landfills, and to dredge a
section of the Hackensack River and build a bulkhead to receive
shipments of dredge spoils that would be used to cap the landfill.
It also requires approval from the state Department of
Environmental Protection.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Cappola, an attorney for EnCap, said the company hopes
to have a final agreement signed with the Hackensack Meadowlands
Development Commission by the end of May. He said 364 of the
approximately 600 acres of land included in the plan are
developable. EnCap would fill in 8.9 acres of contaminated wetlands
as part of the landfill remediation, but would not need to fill in
any additional wetlands as part of the development, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg said EnCap has agreed to pay the commission $6.25
million per year for 99 years to offset the loss of revenue from
solid waste disposal operations, but Cappola said that agreement
has yet to be finalized.
</P>
<P>
   The Bergen County trash transfer station in North Arlington
would be transferred to the Meadowlands commission and closed as
part of the development, said Tom Ammirato, a spokesman for Bergen
County Executive William ''Pat'' Schuber. That would enable the
county to retire $100 million in debt it incurred building the
facility.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, would complicate New York City's efforts to close
Fresh Kills by October, 14 months ahead of schedule. The city had
planned to ship as many as 3,000 tons of trash per day to the
Bergen station on its way to more distant out-of-state landfills.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes, it definitely would have an impact'' on the early closure
plan, said Deputy New York City Mayor Joseph Lhota. ''If it becomes
part of a golf course, obviously no one can use it. I'd have to go
to other options.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the city has been negotiating with other potential
transfer points, but would not identify them or say where they are
located. The city's long-term goal of closing Fresh Kills, the
world's largest garbage dump, by Dec. 31, 2001, is not affected by
the golf course plan, he said.

<HEADLINE> Italians Seek Surrogate Mom Abroad  </HEADLINE>
By PETER W. MAYER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- An Italian couple who won permission to use a
surrogate mother in a landmark court ruling has left the country to
have a baby because of continuing opposition in Italy, their doctor
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Pasquale Bilotta said the decision was ''inevitable given
the climate of hostility they were facing in Italy.''
</P>
<P>
   The February court decision ignited a debate over surrogate
motherhood in Italy, including attacks on the practice from the
Roman Catholic church and the medical establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Then Health Minister Rosy Bindi decried it as a
''commercialization of motherhood,'' and the national physicians'
association threatened Bilotta with disciplinary action if he
carried out the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   The association has had a ban on surrogate motherhood in its
code of ethics since 1995, the year the couple began searching for
someone to bear their child.
</P>
<P>
   Italian law does not forbid surrogate motherhood, although
legislation is pending that would make it illegal in Italy, as it
is in most European countries.
</P>
<P>
   Bilotta froze five artificially inseminated embryos from the
couple, whose identity has not been made public. They only recently
found a surrogate mother, a family friend. He said the couple will
have the embryo implanted in the surrogate mother outside of Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The couple went to court at Bilotta's urging, winning a legal
endorsement for the surrogate pregnancy. But the physicians'
association remained adamantly opposed, citing the possibility of
legal wrangles between surrogate and biological parents.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would have had the right to discipline Dr. Pasquale Bilotta
for breaking our code of conduct,'' said Dr. Aldo Pagni, president
of the physicians' association, the Federation of the Order of
Medical Doctors.

<HEADLINE> Bill Lets Me. To Bargain for Drugs  </HEADLINE>
By FRANCIS X. QUINN
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) -- Legislation enabling the state to
negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs on behalf of more
than 300,000 residents won overwhelming support from lawmakers
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Angus King is expected to sign the legislation after the
state House and Senate gave final approval Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The measure allows the state to seek substantial discounts from
suppliers similar to those provided to other large purchasers and
to pass those savings to consumers. If negotiations with
manufacturers fail to reduce prices significantly, price controls
could be imposed in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier legislation that would have created a state board to
impose maximum prices tied to pricing levels in Canada raised the
threat of a veto from King, who questioned the constitutionality of
linking Maine prices to an out-of-state standard.
</P>
<P>
   The new version dropped reference to Canadian prices and put off
decisions on price controls that originally were scheduled for
2001.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Chellie Pingree, a Democrat, predicted
that having the state serve as a pharmaceutical benefit manager for
about 325,000 Maine residents without insurance that covers drugs
would avoid the necessity of imposing limits on prices.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say the new measure could win price discounts of
between 12 percent and 15 percent by Jan. 1. They predict discounts
would increase over time as more favorable rebate arrangements were
arranged with manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic House Speaker Steven Rowe said all Maine citizens
should be able to share in savings already available for people in
health maintenance organizations or on Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to use our purchasing power,'' Rowe said.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers criticized as vague or coercive an
anti-profiteering section of the legislation, which could be used
to assess civil penalties of up to $100,000 for drug manufacturers
or distributors who charge what is judged to be an excessive price
or who restrict supplies in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Some opponents denounced the legislation generally as an
unjustifiable intrusion into the free market.
</P>
<P>
   ''So it looks like we're going into competition again with the
private sector,'' complained Republican Rep. Debra Plowman.

<HEADLINE> Corzine, Florio Kick Off Debates  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Ex-Gov. Jim Florio and former Wall Street
executive Jon Corzine attacked each other's plans for Social
Security on Thursday in the first of the four debates they have
planned before their Democratic Senate primary.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates, who are seeking the seat of retiring Democratic
Sen. Frank Lautenberg, claimed to have positions in line with
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine supports gradually investing Social Security funds in
the stock market up to 15 percent of the total reserve, saying
market gains will shore up the strength of retirement benefits. He
called it the Clinton-Corzine plan.
</P>
<P>
   Florio denounced the proposal as ''privatization'' that would
allow Wall Street brokers to ''play with our money'' at the risk of
great losses. He claimed Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, the
Democratic candidate for president, have now denounced it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton last year proposed stock-market investment for Social
Security, and the idea was included in his budget proposal now
before Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But the president has backed off in the face of congressional
opposition and to give Gore leeway to attack his Republican
presidential opponent, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, for his
stock-market investment proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, who has engaged in a $1 million-a-week TV ad blitz,
also attempted to explain his ''bold ideas'' platform for mandatory
health insurance coverage, an $8-an-hour minimum wage, government
financing for urban business and universal education for all.
</P>
<P>
   Florio countered that Corzine's proposals were so sweeping as to
be fantasy and would have ruinous impact on the federal budget.
''This is not bold, this is baloney,'' he quipped.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have some tangible accomplishments,'' Florio said. ''I have
experience money can't buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Corzine stumbled and fumbled nervously for some answers, unable
to match Florio's clipped statements and direct attacks. But he
also avoided any significant blunder that could haunt him in the
final three weeks of the campaign. The primary is June 6.

<HEADLINE> Koreas Share a National Dish  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Pro-Western South Korea is a world
economic power. Communist North Korea is destitute. A sealed border
separates their populations. But one thing they share is kimchi.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's foreign news outlet, KCNA, often delivers
diatribes against the United States. But on Wednesday, it dwelled
lovingly on the spicy, pickled vegetable dish popular on both sides
of the Demilitarized Zone, the buffer zone between the Koreas.
</P>
<P>
   In an unpolished English report, KCNA said: ''Kimchi is one of
the staple foods of the Korean people, adding that for foreigners
it's ''literally hot stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Fermented with fiery red peppers, radishes, ginger, salt and
lots of garlic, kimchi is believed to be rich in vitamins C, E and
K. Usually made of cabbage, it is eaten at just about every meal in
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   For years, North Korea has relied on outside aid to alleviate
food shortages caused by drought, flooding and economic
mismanagment. Many factories have shut down because they lack parts
or electricity, but the kimchi industry appears healthier than
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Kimchi is still made the old-fashioned way in rural parts of the
South, and many areas in the less-developed North.
</P>
<P>
   Producers bury vegetables in covered pots and let them ferment
underground over the winter in a pickling method that was developed
centuries ago, when a royal dynasty ruled all of Korea. The
peninsula divided into American and Soviet spheres of influence at
the end of World War II, and the two sides fought a 1950-53 war.
</P>
<P>
   A Seoul firm has even developed what it says is the perfect
remedy for a hangover: a Vitamin-rich beverage called ''kimchi
juice.''

<HEADLINE> Army Releases Gulf War Records  </HEADLINE>
By CONNIE CASS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Army investigators looking into allegations of
Persian Gulf war crimes by troops under retired Gen. Barry
McCaffrey interviewed dozens of soldiers and found no wrongdoing,
newly released documents show.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to allegations first made in an anonymous letter, the
Army Criminal Investigation Command in August 1991 investigated
whether members of the 24th Infantry Division killed enemy
prisoners or violated the cease-fire that ended the war.
</P>
<P>
   The documents, released under a Freedom of Information request,
come as the allegations have been revived in a dispute between
McCaffrey and journalist Seymour Hersh, who researched the events
for an upcoming New Yorker magazine article.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey, now President Clinton's top drug policy adviser,
accused Hersh of spreading false allegations and ''journalistic
stalking'' through a series of interviews with friends and former
Army colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Hersh has declined to comment on his work before publication but
said in a letter to McCaffrey's office that he was simply ''asking
questions, listening to answers and trying to verify and assess
what I've been told.''
</P>
<P>
   The hundreds of pages of Army records provide new details about
a fiery attack on a division of Iraq's elite Republican Guard on
March 2, 1991 -- two days after President Bush declared a
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although the engagement occurred after the cease fire, this
inquiry has substantiated that the engagement was clearly provoked
by the Iraqis,'' said a Sep. 9, 1991, memo from the Criminal
Investigation Command. The fight ''was within the cease fire rules
of engagement.''
</P>
<P>
   Some investigative documents were withheld by the Army, citing
privacy and other concerns, and others were missing. Other
documents record interviews with soldiers and officers, whose names
were blocked out, describing what became known as the ''Battle of
Rumaylah.''
</P>
<P>
   A battalion of the 24th Infantry Division was surprised in the
early morning darkness of March 2 by the appearance of a convoy of
several hundred vehicles, including tanks, artillery, rocket
launchers and trucks. The Iraqis apparently were leaving Kuwait and
looking for a way to cross U.S. lines to the safety of home.
</P>
<P>
   But soldiers of the 24th Division reported receiving fire from
an Iraqi tank and a missile and saw other weapons among the convoy
pointed toward them. As a result, commanders ordered them to open
fire.
</P>
<P>
   One officer at McCaffrey's command post told investigators that
while the attack was under way, ''I thought it was a slaughter. But
the bottom line was he (McCaffrey) was doing what was necessary to
protect the force because they had been fired on and nobody knew
what these guys were liable to do.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey, who flew to the front lines to lead the attack, later
told a Senate panel that his forces destroyed at least 630 vehicles
and pieces of equipment. He didn't estimate the number of Iraqi
soldiers killed but said many fled their vehicles and escaped
unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe that my actions at Rumaylah were completely
appropriate and warranted in order to defend my troops against
unknown and largely unknowable enemy forces and intentions,''
McCaffrey said in a May 8 letter to The New Yorker responding to
Hersh's questions.
</P>
<P>
   The Army investigators' memo also said that ''after extensive
interviews with personnel from brigade and battalion commanders to
privates, there was no evidence'' that soldiers at Jalibah Airfield
''killed or mistreated'' prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators did find that one Iraqi prisoner was
''accidentally shot'' two days before the U.S. attack at the
airfield. But they said that shooting was reported up the chain of
command and ''properly determined to have been an accident.''
</P>
<P>
   The allegations surfaced in August 1991 in an anonymous letter
alleging the attack after the cease-fire was ''a war crime''
covered up by military leaders and that soldiers ''slaughtered some
prisoners after the Jaliba Airfield attack.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey was a four-star general when he retired to take the
drug policy post. He has waged a pre-emptive strike against the New
Yorker article, complaining to reporters and editors about Hersh's
tactics in interviews.

<HEADLINE> USDA Sugar To Stabilize Prices  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Agriculture Department announced plans
Thursday to buy and store 150,000 tons of surplus sugar, worth an
estimated $60 million, to prop up domestic prices.
</P>
<P>
   The department put off the decision about what to do with the
sugar. The department has considered donating it overseas or
selling it at a steep discount for refining into ethanol, a fuel
additive normally made from corn.
</P>
<P>
   With domestic sugar prices down 25 percent from a year ago,
growers have been threatening to forfeit to the government as much
as $550 million worth of sugar pledged as collateral on federal
marketing loans.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are acting to help address dramatically low sugar prices,''
said Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman. ''By buying U.S. sugar
now, we expect to save as much as $6 million in administrative
costs that the government might otherwise incur from expected loan
forfeitures later this summer.''
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of candy and food makers, consumer advocates, and
environmental groups that opposes the sugar program has urged
Glickman to allow prices to fall.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman's decision, announced Thursday night, came on the eve
of a visit by President Clinton to Minnesota, a major sugar-growing
state. Clinton and Glickman were to visit a farm outside of the
Minneapolis-St. Paul area Friday to appeal for Congress to approve
permanent trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   The government guarantees farmers a minimum price for domestic
sugar through the loan program and quotas on imports, but increases
in domestic production are making it difficult for USDA to control
domestic prices.
</P>
<P>
   Growers who put their sugar up as collateral for a federal loan
have the right to forfeit the crop to the government if prices fall
below the guaranteed price.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sugar program does not need Band-Aids, it needs major
surgery,'' groups opposed to the program said in a letter last
month to Glickman.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman urged sugar growers to cut back on plantings by idling
land in the government's Conservation Reserve Program, which pays
farmers to take acreage out of production.
</P>
<P>
   ''We expect the sugar industry to rapidly develop conservation
and production options that can form the basis of a sustainable
sugar policy,'' Glickman said. ''Simply relying on continued
government purchases over the longer term is neither feasible nor
realistic.''

<HEADLINE> Two Wounded Near Arkansas School  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID A. LIEB
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAIRIE GROVE, Ark. (AP) -- A police officer exchanged gunshots
with a seventh-grader Thursday as the boy headed toward his junior
high school with a shotgun, authorities said. Both were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, who was assigned part-time to the school, was
treated and released from a hospital. The 12-year-old was in stable
condition after being shot in the abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's stuff that indicates he was heading back to school,''
said Police Chief Robin Casey. ''I think the good Lord was on our
side today. I think he helped us out and prevented any kids from
getting hurt and hopefully prevented this kid from dying.''
</P>
<P>
   Prairie Grove Superintendent Tom Louks said the boy had skipped
school Tuesday and Wednesday after being involved in a dispute
Monday. The boy was brought to school by at least one of his
parents Thursday but left shortly after classes began, Louks said.
</P>
<P>
   Louks said the boy had not been suspended because of Monday's
incident and had not been a discipline problem before.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know the boy from church. A nice young man,'' Louks said.
</P>
<P>
   The superintendent would not say what happened to the boy
Monday, but a classmate said she heard that he had been punched.
Students said the boy, whose name was not released, was friendly.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wasn't violent. We talked about school and stuff,'' said
John Gladwin, 13, who said he has known the boy since kindergarten.
''He was a smart guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said a resident called Thursday morning, concerned that a
boy seen walking down a road might have been skipping school. Sgt.
Greg Lovett was dispatched from his office at the Prairie Grove
Junior High School.
</P>
<P>
   In his search, he ran across Louks and a principal who said they
had seen the boy near a hay field. When Lovett called to the boy,
the child stood up in the tall grass and fired three or four blasts
from what Casey described as ''a family gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Lovett was hit in the face and the chest, then in the back and
buttocks as he turned away. Lovett returned fire, getting off about
five rounds, striking the boy once in the stomach, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Louks said he didn't realize the boy was armed until the first
shot was fired. Lovett was wearing a bulletproof vest.
</P>
<P>
   Prairie Grove is 200 miles west of Jonesboro, where boys age 13
and 11 shot and killed four classmates and a teacher two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, two students in Littleton, Colo., killed 12 students
and a teacher before committing suicide inside Columbine High
School. Other campus shootings have occurred since 1997 in
Pennsylvania, Oregon and Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   The Prairie Grove school system, which has about 1,300 students
in grades K-12, serves the town of 1,800 and a rural, mountainous
area on the western fringe of the Ozark Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Police didn't say what charges they would consider against the
boy.

<HEADLINE> A's Demote Pitcher Prieto  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Ariel Prieto, ineffective in his only
start after the Oakland Athletics called him up from the minors,
was sent back to Sacramento of the Pacific Coast League on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The A's, who needed a second lefty in the bullpen, also promoted
left-hander Rich Sauveur from Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Prieto, a right-hander, was recalled from Sacramento on Monday
and started that night at Anaheim. He allowed five runs on 11 hits
in four innings, but was not involved in the decision as the A's
lost 9-8 to the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Prieto was Oakland's first-round pick in the 1995 free-agent
draft and was Oakland's opening day starter in 1997. He missed all
of last season while recovering from elbow surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Sauveur was 2-0 with a save and a 3.90 ERA in 10 games, four of
them starts, for the Sacramento River Cats. The 36-year-old Sauveur
made his major league debut for Pittsburgh in 1986 and also has
played briefly for Montreal, the New York Mets, Kansas City and the
Chicago White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   His last major league appearance was on Aug. 20, 1996, for the
White Sox at Detroit.

<HEADLINE> Cubs Place Grace on 15-Day DL  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago Cubs placed Mark Grace on the 15-day
disabled list Thursday with a strained left hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs recalled first baseman Julio Zuleta to take his place.
The team also designated pitcher Andrew Lorraine for assignment and
called up Todd Van Poppel.
</P>
<P>
   Van Poppel went to the Cubs spring training camp as a non-roster
invitee. He has pitched in the majors with Oakland, Detroit, Texas
and Pittsburgh, going 22-37 with a 6.24 ERA in 135 big league
games. He was the A's first-round draft pick in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   He last pitched in a major league game Sept. 27, 1998, for the
Pirates at Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Van Poppel was 3-4 with a 3.10 ERA in 10 games at Triple-A Iowa
and led the Pacific Coast League in strikeouts with 52.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm looking for any combination,'' Cubs manager Don Baylor
said of the addition of Van Poppel to the beleaguered bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Grace suffered a strained left hamstring running to first base
in the ninth inning in Wednesday's 9-8 11-inning win over
Milwaukee. Grace was batting .294.
</P>
<P>
   Zuleta, who went 1-for-5 with an RBI in Thursday's 14-8 loss to
Milwaukee, was batting .302 with eight homers and 20 RBI in 28
games for Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Lorraine was 1-2 with a 6.47 ERA in eight games.

<HEADLINE> Miami Mayor Charges Review Ordered  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Gov. Jeb Bush assigned a special
prosecutor Thursday to review the flury of accusations made by
Miami Mayor Joe Carollo and the former city manager in the
aftermath of the Elian Gonzalez raid.
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney Bernie McCabe, who works in Pinellas and Pasco
counties, was assigned to review whether criminal charges should be
brought regarding allegations made by former Miami City Manager
Donald Warshaw and Carollo.
</P>
<P>
   Carollo fired Warshaw days after Warshaw refused to fire former
Police Chief William O'Brien, who was alerted to the April 22
federal raid but did not inform the mayor. O'Brien later resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Carollo maintains Warshaw was fired for criticizing him, lying
and trying to turn department heads against him, and not for his
actions in the Elian case.
</P>
<P>
   Carollo also accused Warshaw of extortion, saying Warshaw
threatened to file baseless criminal charges against the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Warshaw later accused Carollo of ordering the police department
to investigate rival politicians, journalists, Spanish-language
radio hosts and supporters of his political opponents. Carollo
denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   A telephone message left Thursday evening for McCabe was not
immediately returned.

   MOORHEAD, Miss. (AP) -- Three high school seniors days away from
graduation were among five teen-agers killed early Thursday when
their car went off a rural road and struck a utility pole.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know exactly what happened but we are working on
it,'' Sheriff Ned Holder said. ''This is the worst I've ever had to
deal with in my four terms as sheriff.''
</P>
<P>
   The three seniors, Colby Donahoo and Chris McCoy, both 18, and
JoAnna Smithhart, 17, attended Indianola Academy, a 477-student
private school that lost another member of its graduating class in
an October car accident.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Lute Zepponi, 19, an academy graduate who was attending
nearby Mississippi Delta Community College, and Jennifer Lynn
Alberson, 19, who attended the school last semester, also died.
</P>
<P>
   The young people ''were loved by their teachers and classmates
and the entire community will feel their loss,'' said Homer Burns,
Indianola Academy's headmaster.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to say the families here are so close, our church
family and family friends,'' said the Rev. Anthony Quyet, who was
assisting Zepponi's family. ''They are very supportive of this
family in their time of need. This is really so hard to cope with,
to understand something of this magnitude.''

<HEADLINE> Argentine Congress OKs Labor Bill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- The Argentine Congress on
Thursday approved a labor reform bill that has sparked weeks of
protests by union groups angry over the bid to overhaul the
country's labor laws.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was approved by a vote of 121 to 84 and nearly a week
after dissident union groups staged a 24-hour nationwide strike
against the reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the bill was expected and is largely seen as the
centerpiece of the efforts by President Fernando de la Rua to
jump-start Argentina's stalled economy.
</P>
<P>
   It calls for extending the trial period of newly hired workers
from 30 days to 90 days. Companies will have more say in their pay
scales and other issues that kept some foreign investors at bay.
Critics have long claimed too much power rested in the hands of
national union leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The government says the new reforms will boost wage flexibility
and create more jobs while reducing the cost of doing business.
Labor leaders claim the new law will hurt workers and do nothing to
ease the country's 14 percent unemployment rate.

<HEADLINE> Bill Lets Maine Bargain for Drugs  </HEADLINE>
By FRANCIS X. QUINN
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) -- The governor signed legislation Thursday
that enables the state of Maine to negotiate lower prices for
prescription drugs on behalf of more than 300,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Angus King signed the legislation Thursday night, just
hours after the state House and Senate gave final approval.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have taken on a national problem. We have taken it on in a
creative and responsible way,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   The measure allows the state to seek substantial discounts from
suppliers similar to those provided to other large purchasers and
to pass those savings to consumers. If negotiations with
manufacturers fail to reduce prices significantly, price controls
could be imposed in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier legislation that would have created a state board to
impose maximum prices tied to pricing levels in Canada raised the
threat of a veto from King, who questioned the constitutionality of
linking Maine prices to an out-of-state standard.
</P>
<P>
   The new version dropped reference to Canadian prices and put off
decisions on price controls that originally were scheduled for
2001.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Chellie Pingree, a Democrat, predicted
that having the state serve as a pharmaceutical benefit manager for
about 325,000 Maine residents without insurance that covers drugs
would avoid the necessity of imposing limits on prices.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say the new measure could win price discounts of
between 12 percent and 15 percent by Jan. 1. They predict discounts
would increase over time as more favorable rebate arrangements were
arranged with manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic House Speaker Steven Rowe said all Maine citizens
should be able to share in savings already available for people in
health maintenance organizations or on Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to use our purchasing power,'' Rowe said.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers criticized as vague or coercive an
anti-profiteering section of the legislation, which could be used
to assess civil penalties of up to $100,000 for drug manufacturers
or distributors who charge what is judged to be an excessive price
or who restrict supplies in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Some opponents denounced the legislation generally as an
unjustifiable intrusion into the free market.
</P>
<P>
   ''So it looks like we're going into competition again with the
private sector,'' complained Republican Rep. Debra Plowman.

Jones took one step and stepped on third, then threw to second

</P>
<P>
   Lowell was out by less than half a step.

<HEADLINE> Japan: Economy Improving Modestly  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Japan on Friday slightly upgraded its general
economic assessment, saying improvements were led by growing
activity in the corporate sector.
</P>
<P>
   The Economic Planning Agency said the economy was improving at a
''modest pace,'' but personal consumption and capital spending --
the two main pillars of private demand -- were unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   ''Signs are gradually emerging, primarily in the corporate
sector, of a self-sustaining recovery,'' the EPA said in its
monthly report.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's pronouncements are closely watched by businesses
and economists as key indicators of government thinking on the
state of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   One sign of improvement in the corporate sector was a 1.4
percent rise in industrial production from January to March
compared to the same quarter a year ago, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency emphasized that industry surveys estimated industrial
production would rise another 1.3 percent in May after slipping 1.0
percent in April.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is fighting to overcome a decade-long economic downturn.
The economy fell back into recession late last year after a short
period of uneven growth. Unemployment is at a record high of 4.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs of hope, however. Many corporations have
restructured over the past year, and industrial activity has begun
to show signs of perking up.
</P>
<P>
   The government has also tried boosting the economy through
massive injections of public money.
</P>
<P>
   Takashi Omori, the EPA's director of domestic economic affairs,
cited growing inventories at companies as a sign that businesses
are ''stocking up in a forward-looking manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Personal consumption, however, continues to suffer from flagging
incomes, while capital spending is expected to be lower than
year-earlier levels for the January to March quarter, Omori said.

<HEADLINE> Plane Makes Emergency Landing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- An American Airlines Airbus with 263
passengers aboard made an emergency landing Thursday at the
Charleston Airport after reporting hydraulic problems.
</P>
<P>
   Three people were taken to area hospitals for treatment of
stress-related injuries, said Fred Chapin, operations director for
the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 1416 was en route from San Juan, Puerto Rico, to New York
City's John F. Kennedy International Airport when pilots reported
the problem. The landing gear worked properly during the 5:15 p.m.
emergency landing, Chapin said.
</P>
<P>
   Chapin said the only problem at the airport was ''a lot of
frustrated passengers.'' American Airlines doesn't fly to
Charleston, so the company had to fly in another plane to take
passengers to New York City.

<HEADLINE> Getting Corzine out in the open, Florio goes after him hard in TV debate </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Thrilled to get his wealthy opponent out in
the open, Jim Florio tirelessly attacked Jon Corzine on Thursday in
the first of their four debates in the Democratic primary for U.S.
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Corzine stumbled and fumbled nervously for some of
his answers, unable to match Florio's clipped statements and direct
attacks. But the former Wall Street executive new to elective
politics also avoided any significant blunder that could haunt him
in the final three weeks of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic candidates are scheduled to face off three more
times next week. Thursday's debate was taped at New Jersey Network
studios here and aired on NJN at 9 p.m. Thursday. It also was
scheduled to air at 3 p.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The debating comes on the heels of a poll by Quinnipiac College
of Hamden, Conn., that concluded Corzine had gained a 48-33 percent
lead over Florio, a dramatic turn of the tables from a poll by the
same institute in March that had given Florio a 2-to-1 edge. Many
doubted the accuracy of the latest poll, including both campaign
staffs, because it did not screen for likely voters, but most did
accept the notion that Corzine was gaining rapidly as his $1
million-a-week TV ad blitz was starting to pay off.
</P>
<P>
   The chief issue in the debate Thursday was Social Security, with
both Democrats claiming positions in line with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine supports gradually investing Social Security funds in
the stock market up to 15 percent of the total reserve, saying
market gains will shore up the strength of retirement benefits. He
called it the Clinton-Corzine plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I stand with President Clinton for securing and strengthening
Social Security,'' Corzine said.
</P>
<P>
   Florio denounced the proposal as ''privatization'' that would
allow Wall Street brokers to ''play with our money'' at the risk of
great losses. He claimed Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, the
Democratic candidate for president, have now denounced it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am pleased that the president rejects it, the vice president
rejects, I do and most members of the New Jersey congressional
delegation reject it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton last year proposed stock-market investment for Social
Security, and the idea was included in his budget proposal now
before Congress. But the president has backed off in the face of
Congressional opposition and to give Gore leeway to attack his
Republican presidential opponent, Texas Gov. George Bush, for his
stock-market investment proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine on Thursday attempted to explain his ''bold ideas''
platform for mandatory health insurance coverage, an $8-an-hour
minimum wage, government financing for urban business and universal
education for all, regardless of ability to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Florio countered that Corzine's proposals were so sweeping as to
be fantasy and would have ruinous impact on the federal budget.
''This is not bold, this is baloney,'' he quipped.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have some tangible accomplishments,'' Florio said. ''I have
experience money can't buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Florio's attack was constant as he ignored several questions in
order to use the allotted debate time to pick on Corzine.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when asked about the crisis in Sierra Leone,
Florio criticized Corzine's former firm, Goldman Sachs, for
financing oil enterprises in Sudan, claiming the firm's actions
provided financial support to a repressive government.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about racial profiling, Florio talked about ethnic
jokes attributed to Corzine which the candidate has said he does
not recall making but for which he has nevertheless apologized.

<HEADLINE> Grenade Eyed in Salvador Blast  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) -- A massive explosion at a
military arms depot that injured at least 55 people and damaged
hundreds of homes was probably triggered by the accidental
explosion of a grenade, the defense minister said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Juan Martinez Varela told a news conference that the
explosion of a grenade is what ''we believe set off a chain
reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   The explosion occurred Wednesday afternoon in a storage area
beneath a former military barracks on the northern edge of the
capital. Officials say 408 nearby houses were damaged or destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said the site had been built with safety in mind: ''It
is precisely because the storehouse was built that way that the
damage has not been so grave.''
</P>
<P>
   He said police and military explosives experts were removing
grenades and other weapons that the explosion had hurled hundreds
of yards around the site. Thousands of people live in that area.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A rally on Wall Street helped Tokyo stocks rebound
somewhat early Friday from the previous day's plunge. The dollar
was lower against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 344.75
points, or 2.04 percent, to 17,227.21 in the first 30 minutes of
trading. On Thursday, the average closed down 819.01 points, or
4.63 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 107.76 yen, down 1.94 yen from late Thursday
in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 108.53 yen.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, prices started higher with buying centered
on information technology issues in line with a similar move in
U.S. stocks Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose
114.85 points to 3,499.58 at Thursday's finish. The Dow Jones
industrial average climbed 178.19 points to close at 10,545.97.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's rebound on Wall Street came after a report of a
slowdown in U.S. retail sales calmed investors who have been
selling stocks amid fears about rising interest rates ahead of a
Federal Reserve policy-board meeting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 29.40 points, or 1.84 percent, to 1,630.13.
The TOPIX closed down 59.13 points, or 3.56 percent, the day
before.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, traders said the dollar moved lower
against the yen as some investors locked in profits following the
greenback's recent gains.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 97.38 yen, down from
99.52 yen late Thursday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose
to 1.6950 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.6800 percent. Its
price fell 0.13 point to 100.90.

<HEADLINE> Mayors, Clinton administration endorse march for gun control  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton plans a kickoff reception
for 1,000 mothers attending Sunday's rally for gun control, while
city leaders from around the country endorsed the Mother's Day
demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Million Mom March'' has special meaning for Scott King,
mayor of Gary, Ind. His 17-year-old nephew was shot to death in
June after fighting with another teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a different ball game when you sit in a church and you
hear sobbing behind you, and it's your own children sobbing for
their cousin,'' said King, who was representing the U.S. Conference
of Mayor's with Anthony Williams of the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The rally for licensing of gun owners and registration of their
handguns will take place on the National Mall and in more than 70
other communities nationwide. Donna Dees-Thomases, a Short Hills,
N.J., mother came up with the idea for the march.
</P>
<P>
   The White House reception by the president and Hillary Rodham
Clinton is intended to launch the march. Mrs. Clinton, running for
the Senate from New York, is expected to join numerous celebrities
and politicians in the demonstration. The president will not attend
because of security precautions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also told reporters he did not want to steal the
limelight from organizers. Asked whether the march could motivate
Congress to pass more gun control, Clinton said, ''I don't know,
but it ought to.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore was slated to baby sit his grandson,
Wyatt, on Sunday so that his wife, Tipper, and their daughter,
Karenna, could join the march.
</P>
<P>
   The president said that ''if a couple hundred thousand people
show up here and several hundred thousand at these sites around the
country it ought to send a signal that we want America to be a safe
country and common sense gun legislation is part of the strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno told her weekly news conference that
she hopes to finish a commencement address at Northwestern
University law school in the Chicago area in time to attend a march
there.
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential hopeful George W. Bush, when asked about
the rally, said, ''I'm glad there's a lot of people talking about
gun violence. Gun violence concerns a lot of folks and it should.''
Bush said he supports use of trigger locks on guns.
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, members of a pro-gun organization, Second Amendment
Sisters, plan speeches on the Washington Monument grounds and a
march to the Capitol. The event is independent of the National
Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled as the keynote speaker for the self-defense advocacy
group is Texas state Rep. Suzanna Gratia-Hupp. Nearly a decade ago,
she was a patron in a restaurant in Killeen, Texas, when an armed
man entered and killed 21 people, including her parents.
</P>
<P>
   Gratia-Hupp has said that if she had been allowed by law to
carry her legally owned sidearm into the restaurant, she would have
been able to stop the man with a clear shot from less than 5 yards
away.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor King from Indiana spoke to reporters in front of the U.S.
Conference of Mayors' ''Wall of Death,'' which has 4,001 names of
gun violence victims since the April 1999 shootings at Columbine
High School in Colorado. The name of his nephew, Blake King, was
among those listed.
</P>
<P>
   King said that after Blake had a scuffle with a friend, the
other teen-ager went to his home next door and returned with his
father's handgun. King said that while he was growing up in
Chicago, ''I got into the same kind of fights. But no guns were
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Three-fourths of women surveyed in a new Gallup poll said they
support more strict gun controls, compared with about half of the
men questioned.
</P>
<P>
   The poll of 1,031 adults was taken May 5-7 and has an error
margin of 3 percentage points, larger for subgroups.

<HEADLINE> Wild animal sanctuaries will find homes for Tiger Lady's big cats  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Several wild animal sanctuaries across the
country have agreed to take in 26 Bengal tigers from a Jackson
Township preserve that has lost its permit to keep them.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got commitments from (several members), we're just trying
to figure out how to split them up amicably,'' said Carol Asvestas,
a board member of the American Sanctuary Association, a 27-member
coalition of wild animal preserves nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Asvestas, president of the Wild Animal Orphanage in San Antonio,
Texas, said Thursday that her organization has worked to place the
animals since officials from the New Jersey Division of Fish and
Wildlife contacted her 1{ years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''We agreed to take them if necessary,'' Asvestas said.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Joan Byron-Marasek had 16 big cats at her Tigers
Only Preservation Society. Today, there are 26. Asvestas was
dismayed that Byron-Marasek has allowed her brood to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ''She has not been responsible enough to stop any breeding, but
that has not altered our commitment. It's just making it a little
more difficult,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Page, a spokesman for the state Department of
Environmental Protection, said the department is considering what
legal steps it can take to thwart any further breeding at the
preserve.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's already a substandard, overcrowded facility. We're hoping
it doesn't get even more overcrowded,'' said Page.
</P>
<P>
   Byron-Marasek's permit to keep the tigers on her Ocean County
compound was revoked after a state investigation revealed the
animals were not receiving proper care. The state also faulted her
for poor record-keeping.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation began when a 431-pound tiger was spotted
roaming about a mile from the compound. It was shot by a police
officer after officials failed to capture it.
</P>
<P>
   Byron-Marasek denied that the tiger belonged to her. The site
also is near Six Flags Great Adventure, which has tigers at its
safari park. DNA tests later confirmed that the tiger had escaped
from the Tigers Only preserve.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Administrative Law Judge John Tassini recommended
that Byron-Marasek's permit not be renewed. She has said she would
fight to keep the big cats on her property.
</P>
<P>
   Page said Byron-Marasek has until Monday to file an exception to
that finding, or she could wait until Department of Environmental
Protection Commissioner Robert Shinn makes his final ruling on the
matter, and then appeal through the court system.
</P>
<P>
   Valter Must, a Lakewood attorney who is representing
Byron-Marasek, told The Times of Trenton for Thursday's edition
that he planned to file a challenge to Tassini's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Although it would be Byron-Marasek's responsibility to relocate
the tigers, state officials took the precautionary measure of
finding them homes.
</P>
<P>
   Asvestas, of the American Sanctuary Association, said the tigers
would be split into groups of five or so and sent to preserves in
California, Illinois, Texas and Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   First they would go to her 50-acre compound in San Antonio for
about 90 days. There, they would receive veterinary care and be
neutered, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Asvestas' group worked with the state to find homes for dozens
of wild animals removed from a Scotch Plains zoo three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those animals are thriving beautifully,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Educators Oppose Fund, Score Tie  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Voluntary national tests given to
schoolchildren should not be used to punish or reward the schools
they attend, a congressional hearing on funding the exams was told
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and the top contenders for his job have
suggested tying federal education grants to student scores on the
National Assessment of Educational Progress, sampled tests in math,
reading and other subjects. But a panel of education experts,
including those who administer the tests, gave House lawmakers
varied reasons for their opposition to changing a yardstick into a
carrot and stick.
</P>
<P>
   The test ''should not be used for high stakes decisions,'' said
Michael E. Ward, North Carolina's superintendent of public
instruction. ''It is critical we preserve and maintain the existing
use for NAEP results.''
</P>
<P>
   The tests -- some given for 30 years in subjects ranging from
math and reading to art and civics -- are generally considered the
only way to compare student progress nationwide, because states'
tests vary so widely.
</P>
<P>
   Their funding and purpose -- along with other education research
programs -- were being reviewed Thursday by a House Education and
Workforce subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Mark D. Musick, who chairs the board that sets the test
standards, said the tests should mainly be used to track state
progress over time and help validate results from states' own
tests. Consequences, he suggested, could jeopardize the credibility
and integrity of the program: ''Congress should take steps to
ensure that the National Assessment is buffered from partisan
politics. The trusts of the public are too precious to leave up to
good will, personalities and, in a word, chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Michael Castle, R-Del., who chairs the House subcommittee,
said Thursday there were many reasons to question a ''high-stakes''
use of the tests. For one, he said, just 40 states give the tests.
Delaware is among ones that can't get enough schools to sign up for
the tests because teachers and students already are burdened with
mandatory exams, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the national exams are not based on any
particular state's academic standards, could skew true measures of
schools by exempting disabled children and non-native English
speakers, and need more independence from local administration
officials who may have a political stake in how the test scores are
recorded and released. But no one said the government should stop
funding the voluntary sampling program, which has cropped up in
various policy speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's budget plan includes $50 million to reward large, but
unspecified, improvements on the math and science tests. Vice
President Al Gore -- accused of using 1998 reading scores to tout
administration successes -- drafted a plan to measure state's
progress based on the scores. And George W. Bush, the presumptive
GOP nominee, said he would reward states, using the tests, the SAT
and other exams.
</P>
<P>
   Gore believes NAEP can be used as a tool to hold states
accountable for improving student achievement, said spokesman Doug
Hattaway.
</P>
<P>
   ''Under his state accountability plan, states would be required
to use NAEP, or develop another means to benchmark their state
assessments against the national standards in NAEP,'' Hattaway said
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Worker Admits Education Dept. Theft  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Bell Atlantic technician under contract with
the Education Department has pleaded guilty to taking part in a
scheme that defrauded the agency of $1 million since 1997, federal
officials said Thursday. Several Education Department employees and
contract workers could be charged, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The fraud involved stealing television sets, digital cameras,
computers and falsely charging for overtime, said Wilma Lewis, the
U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Six Education Department workers, who were not further
identified, have been suspended without pay indefinitely, said
Erica Lepping, a department spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Three contract workers with Bell Atlantic and another
undisclosed company have been fired, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have zero tolerance for illegal activity,'' said Lepping,
who said two-thirds of the stolen property had been recovered.
</P>
<P>
   The technician, Robert J. Sweeney, 42, of Upper Marlboro, Md.,
pleaded guilty to conspiracy and theft charges in U.S. District
Court on Wednesday. He faces a maximum 15 years in prison and a
$500,000 fine when he is sentenced at a later date.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bell Atlantic cooperated fully with the federal authorities
throughout their investigation,'' said spokesman Steven Marcus, who
added that the telecommunications company fired Sweeney last
December after its own investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Sweeney, assigned full-time to install phones in
department offices, began sometime in the mid-1990s ordering
equipment such as phones and answering machines unrelated to his
work. He picked them up from a warehouse and gave them to
co-workers for personal use. The stolen items included a 61-inch
television, computers, digital cameras and more than 100 cordless
phones.
</P>
<P>
   These purchases alone costs the department more than $300,000,
investigators said. Sweeney charged the department overtime for
driving employees and their family members to doctors appointments
and one trip to Baltimore to get one co-worker crabcakes for her
lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery of the scheme comes as the department has tried to
defend itself against congressional charges of mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Pete Hoekstra, R-Mich., chairman the House Education and
Workforce Committee panel that oversees Education Department

<HEADLINE> Mets 3, Pirates 2  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The New York Mets remained unbeaten with Al
Leiter on the mound, getting an eight-hitter from the left-hander
and a solo homer and two RBIs from Todd Zeile to beat the
Pittsburgh Pirates 3-2 on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter (4-0) struck out eight as the Mets improved to 7-0 when
he starts this season. The Mets had lost 10 of 14 and were 4-8 on a
season-long 13-game road trip until Leiter pitched his first
complete game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets scored twice with the help of right fielder Brian
Giles' error in the first inning, even though Rickey Henderson was
thrown out at home, and Zeile homered leading off the fourth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates had won four of five and had scored at least 11 runs
in each of their last three victories, including a 13-9 decision
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter is 3-1 with a 1.20 ERA lifetime against the Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the first six Mets batters reached base in the first
against Jimmy Anderson (1-1), who yielded six hits and three runs --
two earned -- in six innings. Anderson pitched eight shutout innings
in beating the Mets 2-0 on April 15.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, still with the Mets despite clearing waivers the day
before, walked to start the first. Derek Bell followed with a
double to right but Henderson seemed to get off to a slow start
from first and was thrown out at home on a relay throw from Giles
to second baseman Mike Benjamin.
</P>
<P>
   Bell advanced to third on the throw and scored as Giles dropped
Edgardo Alfonzo's fly ball. The ball seemed to knuckle on Giles,
who watched it skip off his glove as Alfonzo took second.
</P>
<P>
   After a groundout and a walk, Zeile lined a run-scoring single
to right. Anderson kept the inning from becoming even bigger by
getting Benny Agbayani to line out to second with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile led off the fourth with his third homer.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates had gotten a run back in the second with first
baseman Zeile's throwing error on a rundown play leading to Luis
Sojo's run-scoring single. The Mets caught Kevin Young halfway
between second and third, but he ducked under third baseman Robin
Ventura's tag before Zeile threw wildly.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Hermansen had a pair of hits for the Pirates, including a
solo homer on Leiter's first pitch of the fifth. Hermansen began
the game batting .103 as a leadoff hitter.
Notes: Leiter's only complete game last season came in the
one-game wild-card playoff against Cincinnati on Oct. 4. ... The
Pirates begin a three-game series at home Friday against the
Brewers, who were 6-0 in Pittsburgh last season. ... Wil Cordero
singled in the second for his sixth consecutive hit over two nights
before grounding out in the fourth. ... The one-run victory was the
Mets' eighth this season. ... Their 13-game road trip that ended
Thursday night was their longest since a 13-game trip late in the
1995 season.

<HEADLINE> Bush Leads Gore Among Women  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush has pulled even with Al Gore in
women's support, helping the Republican edge ahead in a broader
survey of likely presidential voters. Americans say they also feel
Bush is more charismatic, has a better sense of humor and is more
inspiring.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, people in the new polling said they find
Gore, the Democratic vice president, more attractive and more
caring about people.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign polls out Thursday suggested that Bush, the Texas
governor, has largely recovered from his slump in the polls in
March and has made gains among several key voter groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''You get the sense that Bush has repaired some of the damage
from the campaign,'' said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew
Research Center for the People and the Press, although he noted
that voter preferences are still fluid.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has made significant progress with many voter groups,
according to a Voter.com-Battleground poll, which showed him doing
especially well among women and better than he had been among union
households.
</P>
<P>
   It also suggested voters are increasingly pessimistic that the
country is on the wrong track -- a bad sign for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   When the potential margin of sampling error is taken into
account, Gore and Bush were essentially tied in the Battleground
poll among women, a group that Gore very much needs if he is to win
in November. President Clinton carried the women's vote by 16
points in 1996 while splitting the men's vote with Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's lead over Gore among men has remained in double digits
this year, while women's support for the Republican is now 4 points
higher than for Gore, a reversal of the 5-point Gore advantage in
March.
</P>
<P>
   ''Women voters in particular are more negative about the
direction of the country,'' said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake,
who helped conduct the bipartisan Battleground poll.
</P>
<P>
   The poll comes at a time when Gore repeatedly describes the
likely Republican presidential nominee's proposals as ''risky'' or
''reckless.'' Democrats are hoping that tactic eventually will
create a sense of unease about Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the indications are that Bush has an edge in the race and
that Gore is the underdog, which is unbelievable given the strong
economy and what Bush went through in the primaries,'' said
political analyst Stuart Rothenberg.
</P>
<P>
   The Voter.com-Battleground poll highlighted Gore's challenges in
the race. Nationally, Bush led Gore 48 percent to 42 percent among
likely voters in the bipartisan survey by Democratic pollster Lake
and Republican pollster Ed Goeas.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a Los Angeles Times poll showed Bush leading among
registered voters by 51 percent to 43 percent. A Pew poll of
registered voters showed the race essentially even.
</P>
<P>
   While such results give an indication of support nationwide, the
presidential contest will be settled by separate elections in each
state, with candidates competing for electoral votes en route to
the required 270.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's improved performance was reflected in an ABC-Washington
Post poll released late Thursday. Bush had a 49 percent to 44
percent edge over Gore in the poll, compared to a dead heat in the
same poll in April. Gore led on the question of who would do a
better job on the issues of gun control, Social Security and
prescription drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Voters feel the country is going in the wrong direction by 49
percent to 39 percent, according to the Voter.com-Battleground
poll. Both pollsters agreed the negative sentiment is bad for
incumbents, especially Democrats. Voters' top issues were moral
values and education, with both polls reflecting a focus on concern
about children.
</P>
<P>
   The Battleground poll found that Bush had a 55 percent to 41
percent lead among so-called Reagan Democrats. Gore had a 12-point
lead among Hispanics, a group that once favored Bush, and a big
advantage among single women and blacks.
</P>
<P>
   The poll of 1,000 likely voters was taken May 1-3 and had an
error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   In six state polls released Thursday, Bush and Gore were
competitive in Michigan and New Jersey, while Bush had an edge in
Georgia, North Carolina and Ohio. Bush was 20 points ahead in
Virginia, according to the polls by the American Research Group.
</P>
<P>
   The scant attention being paid to the campaign at this stage
''means the background dynamics of the election come to the fore,''
said political scientist Bruce Buchanan of the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even though the economy is good, among key groups like
independent voters there is an element of wanting to move toward
change, but in a safe way,'' he said. ''And the governor looks
acceptable.''

<HEADLINE> Notes From Thursday's Games  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressAMERICAN LEAGUE:
Royals-Indians:
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: Kansas City is in a 32-day stretch where it plays
21 of 27 games on the road. ... The Royals have the best home
record in the AL at 14-4. The Royals have batted .334 and averaged
6.9 runs a game at home. ... RHP Miguel Batista, acquired recently
from Montreal, is scheduled to make his first appearance against
Cleveland on Friday. ... When Kansas City shut out Detroit on
Wednesday, the Royals became the final major-league team to
participate in a shutout this season.
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: Acting manager Grady Little said the Indians will
activate OF Kenny Lofton and RHP Bartolo Colon on Friday. Lofton
has been sidelined with a strained left biceps since April 30.
Colon, out since April 16 with a pulled left oblique muscle, is
scheduled to start Friday night. ... Lofton's return means
Cleveland's lineup will be at full strength for the first time
since April 18 -- when catcher Sandy Alomar went out with a strained
hamstring. Alomar returned Monday. ... Reliever Steve Karsay said
he does not feel any adverse effects of warming up during five
straight games and appearing in four of them. ''The more I throw,
the sharper I feel,'' said Karsay, who had arthroscopic surgery on
his right elbow last winter. ... From 1995 through last season,
Cleveland compiled a 41-19 record against Kansas City.
Red Sox-Orioles:
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: Tim Wakefield got his first start of the year Thursday
against Baltimore, and it followed a relief appearance one night
earlier against the White Sox. He's the first Boston pitcher to
start a game after making a relief appearance since Vaughn
Eschelman in 1996. ... Jose Offerman singled on the first pitch to
bring his batting average eight points to .206.
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: RHP Pat Rapp got his first start against the Red Sox
since they let him go during the offseason rather than pick up his
$3 million option. ... The Orioles have won only one of the last
five season series against Boston. ... Jeff Conine started at 1B,
his 12th straight start, despite a lifetime .083 average against
Wakefield. ... Baltimore's top two starters, Mike Mussina and Scott
Erickson, are a combined 1-5.
Devil Rays-Yankees:
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: The Devil Rays completed a nine-game stretch against
teams that made the playoffs last season. They were 2-6 in the
first eight games against Texas, Boston and New York. ... Of the
Devil Rays first 32 games, 13 were decided in the game's final
inning including Tuesday night's 4-3, 10-inning loss at New York.
Wednesday's rainout was only the sixth in Tampa Bay history, three
of them this season (two in April at Baltimore). ... Before
Saturday's home game against Toronto, Piniellas County officials
will unveil the Millennium quilt that illustrates educational
programs in the county aimed at children in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: SS Derek Jeter left the game after the second inning
with an abdominal strain in his left side. He is listed as
day-to-day. Jeter has been mired in a slump and flied out in his
only at-bat to extend his hitless streak to 13 at bats over his
last four games. ... Chuck Knoblauch played his second straight
game at second base for only the second time since April 22-23 at
Toronto when he injured his left wrist while swinging a bat in the
on-deck circle. He returned to the lineup Tuesday night after
missing six games and had a pop-fly double that helped set up the
winning run in the l0th inning. ... The Yankees opening day
starting lineup played only its seventh game as a unit Thursday.
Mariners-Athletics:
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: Manager Lou Piniella said LHP Jamie Moyer, who is on
the DL with a strained muscle in the back of his left shoulder,
will try to throw off a mound for the first time Friday. ''He's
getting close. (Friday) the first true test comes. He's thrown long
tosses a few times and there's been no pain,'' Piniella said. ''We
feel fairly comfortable he's in the neighborhood of two weeks away
(from returning).'' ... Piniella said LHP Rob Ramsay, who has a
sore left shoulder, should be available sometime in this weekend's
series against Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: OF Terrence Long, who was struck in the face by a ball
during warmups Wednesday, had surgery Thursday and had his lip
stitched. The swelling in his mouth will have to subside before it
can be determined if he has any nerve damage, but X-rays showed he
has no facial fractures. Manager Art Howe said it was hard to
determine when Long, who was in a lot of pain Thursday, can return.
... Howe said DH John Jaha, who is on the disabled list with a left
shoulder strain, is not likely to return before June. He has begun
hitting fungoes, but still has to heal and then go through a
rehabilitation assignment. ''The end of the month would be
optimistic,'' Howe said. ''That may be a reach.''
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: David Segui, who came into this season with a lifetime
.285 batting average, entered the game against Anaheim hitting .387
-- one point ahead of Anaheim's Darin Erstad. ''I've always thought
I was a pretty decent hitter, so this doesn't surprise me,'' said
Segui, who hit .301 over his previous five seasons. ''I'm glad I'm
doing well, but we've only been playing for a month and a half. If
I'm still hitting this well in August and September, I think I'll
get a little more excited about it.'' ... The only batting champion
in Rangers history was Julio Franco, who hit .341 in 1991. ... LHP
Justin Thompson is scheduled to undergo season-ending arthroscopic
surgery on Friday in Fort Worth to repair a torn rotator cuff.
Thompson had surgery last August to repair a torn labrum in his
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: Mo Vaughn feels that Darin Erstad, who set a major
league record for hits in April with 48, has as good a chance as
anyone to become the second player in Angels history to win a
batting title -- and the first since Alex Johnson in 1970. ''He's
got a great opportunity to do it. It's right there for him,''
Vaughn said. ''It's not something he'll be thinking about now, but
he'll look up in late September and realize where he is. He has a
nice approach and a good stroke, so he'll get his hits. But you
also have to have a lot of luck for things to be going that well,
because it isn't always going to be like that.'' ... Garret
Anderson already has hit four home runs against left-handed
pitchers, one more than he did last season. ... Of Vaughn's nine
home runs, seven have come leading off an inning. ... Angels
pitchers had given up an AL-leading 53 home runs entering
Thursday's games.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Padres-Reds:
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: Reliever Rodney Myers, who tore the tendon below his
right kneecap while fielding a bunt, will become the seventh San
Diego pitcher and the 12th Padre on the disabled list this season.
... Bret Boone had the ninth multihomer game of his career,
including the 13th inside-the-park homer by a Padre. The last one
was Gwynn's grand slam in Los Angeles on June 26, 1997. ... Bret
and Aaron Boone both hit homers, marking the first time that two
brothers homered against each other in the same game since the
Boones did it last Sept. 1. It was only the eighth time that
brothers playing against each other homered in the same game.
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: Ken Griffey Jr. hit his 408th career homer, tying
Cal Ripken Jr. for 28th on the list. ... Dmitri Young, who missed
the last two games because of a stomach virus, doubled in his
second at-bat, extending his hitting streak to a career-high 16
games. It's the longest streak by a Red since Hal Morris hit in 29
games in 1996.
Brewers-Cubs:
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: OF Jeromy Burnitz was hitting .111 in the Brewers
last homestand and went 6-for-18 with nine RBIs in four games
against the Cubs. ... Mark Loretta had five hits, equaling his
career high which he also achieved July 17 against Kansas City. ...
Right-hander John Snyder made his second rehab start Wednesday for
Class A Huntsville and gave up three runs, four hits and two walks
in 6 2-3 innings. Snyder has been on the DL with a strained left
oblique muscle since the end of spring training.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: An MRI Thursday showed a slight tear in 1B Mark Grace's
left hamstring. He was placed on the 15-day disabled list and 1B
Julio Zuleta was recalled from Class AAA Iowa. Grace was injured
running to first in the ninth inning. Zuleta hit .302 at Iowa. ...
Manager Don Baylor gave 2B Eric Young a day off Thursday. ''There
was no argument on his part,'' Baylor said of Young, who was
hitting .318. ... Television broadcaster Steve Stone will miss the
weekend series in Montreal to continue recuperating from removal of
kidney stones. ... Jose Nieves replaced Jeff Huson at second base
in the third inning when Huson strained a muscle in his left rib
cage during an at-bat. Huson's status was day to day. It was
Nieves' first major league appearance at second.
Braves-Marlins:
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: Tom Glavine, who lost for the first time this season
Wednesday, is 2-8 at Pro Player Stadium with a 5.25 ERA. He hasn't
won in Miami in his past six starts, dating back to May 3, 1995.
... Florida left-handed slugger Cliff Floyd, who had a two-run
double against Glavine, hiked his average against lefties to .333.
Against right-handers he was hitting .200. ... Through Wednesday,
the Braves were hitting .143 (5-for-35) with the bases loaded,
worst in the National League. Twice Wednesday they loaded the bases
with none out and failed to score.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: The Marlins transferred left-hander Michael Tejera to
the 60-day DL from the 15-day disabled list. Tejera is recovering
from a torn ligament in his pitching elbow.
Phillies-Expos:
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: 1B Rico Brogna was placed on the 15-day DL with a
broken bone in his left wrist. Brogna, who was hit on the wrist by
a Matt Blank pitch in the ninth inning of Wednesday's 8-0 win over
the Expos, returned to Philadelphia. He had his wrist examined by
team physician Dr. Michael Ciccotti and hand specialist Dr. Randall
Culp, who will operate on Brogna's wrist on Friday. Brogna is
expected to be out for the next 10-12 weeks. ... The Phillies
purchased the contract of 1B Chris Pritchett from Triple-A
Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: Closer Ugueth Urbina had an MRI performed on his
injured right elbow. Urbina felt pain in his elbow after throwing
his first pitch while warming up during Tuesday's 3-2 win over the
Phillies. X-rays were taken on Wednesday, leading to Thursday's
MRI. Urbina, who had bone chips removed from his right elbow
following the 1996 season, has eight saves and 22 strikeouts in 13
1-3 innings. With Urbina and setup men Graeme Lloyd and Scott
Strickland all sidelined by arm injuries, staff ace Dustin
Hermanson, who was scheduled to face Chicago's Kerry Wood on
Friday, was asked to assume the closer's role. ''I thought it
wouldn't be a problem,'' Hermanson said. ''I have the mentality of
a closer.'' ... Hermanson's move to the bullpen moved Mike
Thurman's season debut up a day to Friday. Tony Armas Jr. will be
called up from Triple-A Ottawa to start on Saturday. 
Mets-Pirates:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Rickey Henderson remains with the Mets -- and continues
to start in LF -- despite clearing waivers. The Mets now can send
him to the minors between now and July 31 without sending him
through waivers, though he probably would decline such an
assignment. ... Grant Roberts is expected to make his major league
debut Saturday against the Marlins. Roberts, who last pitched
Saturday, is 1-2 with a 3.44 and 34 strikeouts in 36 2-3 innings at
Triple-A Norfolk. ... Bobby J. Jones, hurt during the Mets' visit
to Pittsburgh last month, will make his second rehabilitation start
at Norfolk on Friday night. He allowed nine hits and one run in
seven innings against Syracuse in his first start.
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: Pirates right-hander Francisco Cordova is apparently
headed to the DL with a sore right elbow after experiencing
additional discomfort while throwing on the sideline. The Pirates
probably will call up a pitcher from the minors to start Saturday
against Milwaukee. ... The Pirates were 4-8 against the Brewers
last season, 0-6 at Three Rivers Stadium. ... Right-hander Brad
Clontz, who spent some time with the Pirates before returning
recently to Triple-A Nashville. ... Pirates 1B Kevin Young went on
a 9-for-18 tear after noticing he wasn't keeping his left elbow
tucked in properly. ... Pirates starters have failed to retire the
side in the first inning in every game since April 30. Jimmy
Anderson allowed two runs and two hits Thursday against the Mets.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- William J. Boyle, a banker who played a major
role in devising the first bank-issued credit card, died April 30.
He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, Boyle developed the Franklin Charge Account Plan, which
charged interest and let customers make partial payments each

was a forerunner of Visa and Mastercard.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, charge plans were largely limited to big New York
department stores. In 1950, Diners Club introduced the first charge
card, meaning that balances had to be paid in full. Franklin's
plan, which used the slogan ''Just charge it,'' was the first
credit card.

<HEADLINE> Insanity Plea Accepted in NY Murder  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- A law professor who once was
celebrated for overcoming schizophrenia will not stand trial for
killing his pregnant fiancee after prosecutors accepted his
insanity plea Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said they accepted Michael Laudor's plea of not
responsible by means of mental defect because they conceded that no
jury would convict him of murder in the face of three doctors'
conclusions that Laudor was insane.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ordered that Laudor be re-evaluated to determine his
treatment. Laudor told the judge he was expecting to be returned to
the Mid-Hudson Forensic Psychiatric Center in New Hampton, where he
has been receiving treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Under state rules governing insanity pleas, if the state Office
of Mental Health and the court ever agreed that Laudor was no
longer a danger to himself or others, he could be released.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Costello, 37, was found slashed to death June 17, 1998,
in the kitchen of the apartment she shared with Laudor in
Hastings-on-Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Psychiatric reports summarized in court found that Laudor killed
Costello because he thought she was ''a nonhuman impostor''
conspiring to hospitalize him for torture, experimentation and
death.
</P>
<P>
   Laudor, 37, had won some fame for succeeding as a Yale Law
School graduate and instructor despite his schizophrenia. He had
sold book and movie rights to his story and was considered a role
model for victims who control schizophrenia through medication.
</P>
<P>
   At some point after the death of his father in 1997, he stopped
taking his medication, apparently believing it to be part of a
conspiracy against him, and his condition deteriorated, Prosecutor
Barbara Egenhauser said.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the killing, Costello stayed home from work to try
to help. Laudor's mother and doctor arranged for a visit from a
crisis intervention team. That impending visit, according to one
psychiatric report, precipitated the killing because Laudor thought
he would be tortured and lobotomized.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks after the killing, his lawyer said Laudor still did
not realize Costello was dead. Doctors originally found him unfit
to stand trial, then reversed that decision a year later.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution, anticipating an insanity defense, hired
forensic psychiatrist Park Dietz, who Egenhauser said was ''known
for having a high threshold'' for insanity. But Dietz agreed with
the defense psychiatrists that Laudor believed his fiancee was ''a
nonperson, a robot or a doll ... planning to kill or torture him.''
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Jeanine Pirro, saying she had no choice but to
accept the insanity plea, complained about ''a criminal justice
system that allows a psychiatrist to decide whether an individual
stands trial.'' She said psychiatric reports should be considered
only at sentencing, after ''it is decided in a courtroom who
committed a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   The victim's mother and sister railed against the idea that
Laudor was not responsible for Costello's death.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is horrifying for us to accept that our daughter was
murdered by someone she loved and trusted,'' said Marilyn Costello.
''It is horrifying for us to accept that she died all alone,
bleeding, terrified and in pain. ... Michael Laudor alone must bear
the responsibility.''

<HEADLINE> Annan Hints at More S.Leone Troops  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Embattled U.N. forces in Sierra Leone
might need reinforcements and an expanded mandate to combat rebel
attacks and salvage the country's battered peace process,
Secretary-General Kofi Annan suggested Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a late-night emergency meeting of the Security
Council, Annan welcomed the deployment of about 800 British troops
as well as offers by West African countries to contribute extra
forces -- including a possible rapid-reaction force that could take
on a combat role in enforcing the country's peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   But he stressed that wealthy nations would have to pay for it
and contribute logistical support to have ''the capacity to carry
out the tasks this mandate implies.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is vital that the world should not now abandon the people
of Sierra Leone in their hour of greatest need,'' Annan told the
council.
</P>
<P>
   ''I plead with you,'' he said, clasping his hands in front of
him. ''Let us not fail Sierra Leone. Let us not fail Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan's comments, delivered quietly in a hushed chamber, began a
lengthy debate by the council and a dozen other U.N. member states
on how the United Nations can reinforce its 8,700-member mission to
save a crumbling peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 500 U.N. peacekeepers have been taken hostage since
May 1 in attacks by rebels, which have posed a major challenge to
the U.N. peace mission.
</P>
<P>
   ''This test of the U.N. mission in Sierra Leone shows very
clearly that the mandate and resources are not and never were
appropriate to the situation,'' said Abdallah Baali, Algeria's U.N.
ambassador who spoke on behalf of the Organization of African
Unity.
</P>
<P>
   He urged the council adopt a more combat-oriented mandate for
the peacekeepers, who currently are authorized to use force to
protect themselves and civilians in danger but have refrained from
any offensive attacks.
</P>
<P>
   But deputy British Ambassador Stuart Eldon cautioned against
such an ''over-hasty approach,'' saying the focus should be on
getting the existing force up to speed to implement its current
mandate.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has mobilized the remaining three battalions
that would bring the force up to its authorized strength of 11,100,
and the force is now expected to be fully deployed by the end of
the month.

<HEADLINE> Conn. Bishop Heads for New York  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Bishop Edward Egan of Bridgeport, Conn., an
uncompromising defender of traditional Vatican teachings, was
selected by the pope Thursday to succeed Cardinal John O'Connor as
spiritual leader of the New York Archdiocese's 2.4 million Roman
Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Egan, 68, will become the 12th archbishop of New York when he is
formally installed June 19. He is also widely expected to be
elevated to cardinal by Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Egan said he hoped to gain the same
acceptance in New York that the Philadelphia-born O'Connor had
achieved during his 16 years in the church's most prominent
American pulpit.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor died last week of a brain tumor at age 80.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can tell you there is no place in the world that is quicker
to accept someone who wants to be a New Yorker,'' said Egan, who
worked in the New York Archdiocese earlier in his career. ''I want
to be a New Yorker, and I guess I am officially one.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about abortion and birth control, Egan, as he has done
staunchly during his career, backed the pope's opposition to both.
Asked by a Vatican radio reporter whether he would be pro-life,
Egan answered in both English and Italian.
</P>
<P>
   ''With all the enthusiasms and insistence and light that I can
possibly add, the answer is yes,'' he said. ''Without any question,
yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Egan appeared to understand clearly that the New York
Archdiocese, though only the third-largest in the nation, is the
most visible by virtue of its location in the nation's media
capital.
</P>
<P>
   While bantering with the media, Egan encouraged a reporter from
WNBC-TV to use speak louder in identifying the station: ''Don't you
think Mr. Wright'' -- NBC president Bob Wright -- ''wants to hear
that?''
</P>
<P>
   Egan spent 12 years leading 367,000 Catholics in the diocese of
Bridgeport, where he won acclaim for reorganizing diocesan schools
and recruiting local men into the priesthood. He also raised
millions of dollars in his annual bishop's appeal in the diocese,
which embraces Fairfield County, one of the richest in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a renaissance man who can cheer at a Cubs game,'' said
Monsignor Timothy Dolan, an American who heads the North American
Pontifical College in Rome. Egan studied there after his 1957
ordination.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's also an imposing figure and a great preacher,'' Dolan
said, noting the similarity to O'Connor. ''When Ed Egan walks into
a room, he doesn't go unnoticed.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Pieczynski, spokeswoman for the Chicago-based church
reform group Call to Action, described Egan as ''very
conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   ''My understanding is that he is very personable, but also very
rigid in his approach to issues,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Egan, born in Oak Park, Ill., studied theology at Rome's
Gregorian Pontifical University. He served from 1971 to 1985 on the
Vatican tribunal that decides such matters as whether to grant
annulments.
</P>
<P>
   In Bridgeport, Egan came under fire for defending the diocese
against more than two dozen lawsuits over alleged sexual
molestation by priests. Although all but one of the cases preceded
Egan's arrival, they raised tough questions over whether abuse was
covered up.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani Fights Rumors About Future  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani fought off speculation
Thursday that he is about to get out of the Senate race because of
his prostate cancer, his crumbling marriage and reports of his
alleged affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I made no decision yet to drop out of the Senate race,'' he
insisted at a news conference. ''I didn't discuss that with anyone.
I didn't say that to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading New York Republicans said publicly they still support
his candidacy against Hillary Rodham Clinton, but behind-the-scenes
plans were already being made to back another candidate should the
mayor drop out.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Giuliani announced he and his wife of 16 years,
Donna Hanover, are discussing a legal separation. Hanover responded
by dropping her own bombshell, alleging that their marital woes
began a few years ago over his relationship with a former press
aide.
</P>
<P>
   Hanover also said that just as she and the mayor began to
reconcile, he took up with yet another woman. Giuliani, 55, has
acknowledged a relationship with a health care executive, Judith
Nathan.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the mayor lashed out at reporters who shouted
questions about the alleged affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't you guys have the slightest bit of decency?'' he said.
''Do you realize you embarrass yourself doing this in the eyes of
just about everybody?''
</P>
<P>
   He also reiterated that his Senate run is contingent on his
treatment for prostate cancer, which was diagnosed two weeks ago.
''I haven't made up my mind if I have the energy and the capacity
to run,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He angrily complained about news reports that he is on the verge
of abandoning the campaign, calling them ''false rumors.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, a senior Republican official and strong
Giuliani supporter, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The
Associated Press that the mayor was leaning toward quitting.
</P>
<P>
   ''His heart, his soul, his body are not in this thing,'' said
the official, who added that Giuliani hadn't made a final decision.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans must choose a Senate candidate by May 30, when they
hold their state convention. State GOP chairman Bill Powers said on
Thursday: ''Contrary to everybody else's popular belief, I believe
he is running.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rick Lazio, a Long Island congressman, renewed his interest
in running, first expressed months ago. Rep. Peter King of Long
Island and Wall Street multimillionaire Ted Forstmann, a prominent
supporter of Roman Catholic causes, both let it be known they would
be available.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who knows a thing or two about marital problems as
front-page news, refused to comment on the mayor's travails.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just don't think anyone should comment on what they're going
through,'' she said on NBC's ''Today'' show. ''I'm going to, out of
respect for him and his family, have nothing to say about it.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said in Washington: ''Everybody in New York
and everybody in America ought to be rooting for the human side of
this to work out. We should wish him well in the struggle of his
illness, wish that family well and should want the best for their
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Bishop Edward Egan, who was named head of the New York
Archdiocese Thursday, offered an opinion, saying he hopes Catholics
and others ''would have the greatest sympathy for this good human
being who is struggling through two very serious situations.''
</P>
<P>
   GOP presidential candidate George W. Bush, who like other
Republicans questioned President Clinton's integrity after the
impeachment scandal, was asked if voters should be concerned about
the mayor's character.
</P>
<P>
   ''No, I think Rudy's a good fellow and a good man,'' he said on
Lifetime, the cable channel for women. ''I hope he stays in the
race. I'm more concerned about the fact that he's sick.''
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers, meanwhile, were enthralled by the daily drama
coming out of City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's become a public soap opera,'' said Frank Fornario, a
teacher who said he supports Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ''Between the cancer and the situation with his marriage, I feel
he's not interested in the politics,'' said Kathy Andrade, a
retiree who plans to vote for the first lady. ''Stress is no good
for him. He's better off staying home.''

<HEADLINE> Wilkens: Wizards Wants Me To Coach  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lenny Wilkens, the winningest coach in NBA
history, said Thursday night he has been offered the Washington
Wizards coaching job by Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ''They said they would like to have me, no question about it,''
Wilkens said in an interview with Fox Sports Net.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkens also said he was interested in the vacant Vancouver
Grizzlies position, calling it a ''very attractive situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, the Wizards president of basketball operations,
interviewed Wilkens for the first time last week in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Michael and I had a great conversation,'' Wilkens said in the
interview. ''We respect one another. I've coached him in All-Star
situations. I've coached him with the Olympic team, and it was a
very productive meeting. But I've made no decisions. I told Michael
I'd get back to him, which I will. But I have had several
interviews, and I think the thing is to look at all of it, see what
makes sense and weigh what's best for me.''
</P>
<P>
   That could be reference to the Wizards' overpriced veteran
lineup and accompanying salary cap woes, which will probably keep
the team from being competitive for at least another season. Other
the other hand, Wilkens, who lives in Seattle, sounded enthusiastic
about the prospect of coaching the young Grizzlies, who recently
overhauled their front office.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very attractive situation,'' Wilkens said. ''I like the
team. There has been some conversation with my representative, and
we'll see what it goes. First of all, I like the area. ... Also, I
like the team. I think they have some young guys that can be very
competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has said he would like to hire a coach before the May 21
draft lottery. Other candidates include Darrell Walker, who led the
team to a 15-23 record as interim coach after Gar Heard was fired
in midseason, and Golden State assistant Rod Higgins.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkens did not immediately return phone calls Thursday night
seeking further comment. Representatives of the Wizards were also
unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkens, who has 1,179 wins, resigned from the Atlanta Hawks
last month after seven seasons with the club. He also coached in
Cleveland, Seattle and Portland.

<HEADLINE> Phillies 6, Expos 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Montreal third baseman Michael Barrett's error
with two outs in the seventh inning allowed the go-ahead run to
score in the Philadelphia Phillies' 6-4 win over the Expos on
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Wolf (2-2) allowed four runs -- three earned -- and seven
hits in six innings as the Phillies won for the sixth time in their
last eight games.
</P>
<P>
   With Philadelphia trailing 4-3, Mickey Morandini singled off
Carl Pavano (3-1) and scored on Tom Prince's double to tie the
game.
</P>
<P>
   One out later, Prince advanced to third on Kevin Sefcik's
grounder to first. Desi Relaford walked and left-hander Matt Blank
came in to face Bobby Abreu.
</P>
<P>
   Abreu hit a grounder which caromed off Barrett into short left
field, as Prince scored to make it 5-4. Shortstop Orlando Cabrera
recovered the ball and threw to Barrett to cut down Relaford, who
was trying to advance to third. It was Barrett's ninth error of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Gomes, who allowed three runs in Tuesday's 3-2 loss for
his second blown save, pitched the ninth for his sixth save.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal lost its first home series in six at Olympic Stadium
this season. The Expos are 11-7 at home.
</P>
<P>
   Pavano, who struck out a career-high seven in 6 2-3 innings,
allowed Kevin Jordan's two-run triple in the first and Scott
Rolen's RBI double in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Vidro's three-run homer in the bottom half tied it at 3.
Montreal took a 4-3 lead in the fourth when Cabrera's double to the
left field corner rolled past Ron Gant for a two-base error.
Cabrera slid home safely just ahead of the relay.
</P>
<P>
   Morandini hit an RBI triple off Anthony Telford to drive in
Philadelphia's sixth run in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan started at first base in place of Rico Brogna, who was
lost to the Phillies for the next 10-12 weeks with a broken left
wrist.
Notes: A season-low crowd of 8,311 was on hand for the game. ...
... Pavano allowed five runs -- three earned -- and five hits. ...
Phillies reliever Jeff Brantley allowed one hit in two innings in
his second appearance of the season. ... Expos closer Ugueth Urbina
had an MRI performed on his injured right elbow Thursday. Dustin
Hermanson moved to the bullpen and Mike Thurman will start Friday.
Tony Armas Jr. will be called up from Triple-A Ottawa to start on
Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Drug Leaders May Head to US  </HEADLINE>
By BEN FOX
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- U.S. authorities unsealed a criminal indictment
Thursday against the alleged leaders of one of Mexico's most
violent and powerful drug gangs, offered a $2 million reward for
their capture and warned they might flee north of the border to
escape Mexican police.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers Ramon and Benjamin Arellano Felix were charged with
operating a smuggling organization that shipped large quantities of
drugs into Southern California from Mexico and maintained it
through violence, intimidation and bribery.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Arellano Felix has been on the FBI's 10 most wanted list
for three years and the U.S. State Department has offered a $2
million reward for information leading to his arrest since then.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. authorities decided to include Benjamin Arellano Felix
in the reward and detail the contents of the Nov. 16, 1999
indictment to bring additional pressure on the drug organization,
which has been weakened by a series of arrests in Mexico in recent
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Because of those arrests, and the possibility that Mexican
authorities might be closing in on Felixes, authorities believe the
brothers may attempt to flee to the United States, said prosecutor
Gregory Vega.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because they are so notorious in Mexico, we want to make sure
that the American public knows who these individuals are,'' Vega
said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the drug charges, the indictment accuses them of
kidnapping and murdering rival drug traffickers, suspected
informants and law enforcement officers.
</P>
<P>
   If caught and convicted, the brothers could face up to life in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, the two are wanted on charges including murder,
illegal weapons possession and drug smuggling, said Mariano Herran
Salvatti, the country's top anti-drug prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Either Mexico or the United States could prosecute the men and
then extradite them to the other country to face additional charges
under current treaty agreements, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to take them out of the drug business and put them in
jail,'' said William Gore, the agent in charge of the FBI's San
Diego division. ''Whether it's in Mexico or the United States, I
don't care.''

<HEADLINE> US Corporate Giants Eye Cambodia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) -- Cambodian officials on Thursday
courted representatives from American corporations who are taking a
fresh look at the impoverished country, which is at peace for the
first time in three decades.
</P>
<P>
   A two-day conference in the capital organized by the U.S.-ASEAN
Business Council attracted a range of U.S. interests, including
Nike, Citibank, Chevron and Caterpillar.
</P>
<P>
   Cambodian officials were eager to show the 200 or so
participants that the investment climate had improved in their
country, which has been known more for genocide and war than its
free-market economy and cheap labor force.
</P>
<P>
   ''After years of devastation, we cannot (rebuild Cambodia)
alone,'' Commerce Ministry Secretary of State Sok Siphanna said
during an opening address. ''I promise that we will work hard to
gain your confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Cambodia was dragged into the U.S. war in Vietnam in 1970,
igniting a bitter civil war. A Vietnamese invasion ousted the Khmer
Rouge rulers in 1979, but guerrillas continued to battle the
occupying Vietnamese for 10 more years. The government violently
split in 1997 when current Prime Minister Hun Sen ousted his
co-premier.
</P>
<P>
   But conference organizers expressed confidence that the Hun
Sen-led government, elected in 1998, was committed to developing
the country with private-sector investment.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Royal Government of Cambodia is far and away the most
investor-friendly country in the region,'' said Arthur Tay, deputy
chairman of SUTL Properties, a Singaporean real estate company.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Tries Heading Off Rebels  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDRA ZAVIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Sierra Leone soldiers and
pro-government militia drove rebel forces farther from the capital
Thursday, an army spokesman said, as the government moved to head
off a feared guerrilla offensive on Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting near the town of Newton, 25 miles east of Freetown,
came as U.N. peacekeeping troops and pro-government forces geared
up for a possible Revolutionary United Front, or RUF, advance on
the nervous capital, where thousands of frightened villagers have
sought sanctuary in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   The battle near Newton pitted the recently rearmed Sierra Leone
Army and the pro-government Kamajors -- a militia made up of
traditional hunters -- against RUF rebels, said army spokesman
Prince Nicol.
</P>
<P>
   United Nations peacekeepers were not involved in the Thursday
afternoon fighting, said David Wimhurst, a U.N. spokesman in
Freetown. But they did come under rebel fire overnight there and
along a key highway at Port Loko, 65 miles to the east of Freetown,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   No U.N. casualties were reported, but there were unconfirmed
reports some rebels were wounded, Wimhurst said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton on Thursday dispatched the Rev.
Jesse Jackson as a special envoy to the region in an effort to halt
''a return to all-out war.'' The president also directed American
military officials to hasten efforts to ferry in more international
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he spoke Thursday with U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan, and the two agreed a stronger international response is
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ''We intend to support the commitment West African nations have
made to send additional troops to Sierra Leone to restore peace,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chaos swept Sierra Leone after a Nigerian-led regional
intervention force -- which had been in the country along with U.N.
peacekeepers -- pulled out last week.
</P>
<P>
   Angered by efforts to disarm them, the rebels -- who were to
share power with the government under a peace accord signed in July
-- began seizing peacekeepers. By week's end, they held more than
500 U.N. personnel.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Thursday the
rebels had freed two of the U.N. military officials. Maj. Suresh
Karki, a Nepalese military observer suffering from malaria, was
released for medical treatment and Lance Corp. Paucho Singh Chouan,
a member of the Indian contingent, was released unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
   According to Eckhard, Karki said that neither he nor the 19
other people held with him were mistreated by the rebels. The pair
were freed Wednesday, an indication that there may be room for
accommodation between the rebels and the government.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday, the government of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah
said the peace agreement was salvageable.
</P>
<P>
   ''While acknowledging that the RUF has seriously violated the
positions of the accord, (the) government still believes that the
accord can generally be implemented,'' said a statement issued by
Kabbah's office.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations wants to speed deployment of additional
peacekeepers to bring its 8,700-strong force up to its mandated
strength of 11,100. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan suggested
Thursday that the peacekeepers may need to take on a more active
military role to enforce the country's peace accord.

<P>
   ''I plead with you,'' he told the Security Council in Thursday's
open session. ''Let us not fail Sierra Leone. Let us not fail
Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain sent 800 elite paratroopers into the West African
country on Monday to secure the international airport in Freetown
and help evacuate British and foreign citizens.
</P>
<P>
   While the British government has repeatedly stressed that its
soldiers will not be used in a combat role, British helicopters
have ferried U.N. soldiers around the Freetown area, reports in
Britain say.
</P>
<P>
   Following a late night strategy session on Sierra Leone in
London, British Prime Minister Tony Blair said troops from his
nation would continue to evacuate British and European Union
nationals but would not be fighting alongside U.N. peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sierra Leone soldiers thinking they were under
attack, mistakenly fired on U.N. peacekeepers as they broke through
rebel lines, the government said Thursday. Six Kenyan peacekeepers
were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. soldiers had been trapped near the town of Makeni,
about 125 miles east of Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   They were not among the 500 U.N. peacekeepers held hostage by
the rebels. Hundreds of U.N. troops who are not held captive have
been cut off from their units inside pockets of rebel-held
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Leone's army was disarmed under the July peace agreement
that ended the eight-year civil war, but they have in recent days
again taken up arms to defend the city.
</P>
<P>
   Eckhard said the rearmament was done with the permission of the
United Nations ''in order to deal with the actions taken by the
Revolutionary United Front.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicol, a spokesman for former junta leader Johnny Paul Koroma,
who leads many of the government soldiers, said, ''Our men are
combing the area and are succeeding in clearing the way for British
and (United Nations) troops.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. soldiers, Sierra Leone army and pro-government militia
fighters have been reinforcing the main road into Freetown over the
past few days, preparing for an RUF offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Nicols said Nigerian soldiers also were ''very, very active in
supporting our boys.''
</P>
<P>
   While there have been repeated skirmishes outside Freetown, it
remains unclear whether the RUF does plan to attack the capital.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our reconnaissance flights do not show the RUF in an organized
position, ready to pounce on Freetown,'' Eckhard said.

<HEADLINE> New Attys. Win Fugitive Trial Delay  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA DEUTSCH
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A judge Thursday delayed the trial of a
former Symbionese Liberation Army fugitive until next year, giving
her new defense lawyers time to prepare for the case.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Jane Olson, facing trial 25 years after she was charged in
a bomb conspiracy, appeared in court and said she wanted the
postponement.
</P>
<P>
   With three lawyers having bowed out of the case in recent
months, Olson's new defenders, J. Tony Serra and Shawn Chapman,
said they could not be ready by the previous trial date of Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ms. Olson has had just plain bad luck in that her attorneys
were not able to continue,'' said Superior Court Judge James
Ideman.
</P>
<P>
   He reluctantly granted the defense request to delay until Jan.
8.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Eleanor Hunter opposed the delay, arguing that in
such an old case witnesses are elderly and could die in the
interim.
</P>
<P>
   Olson, 53, is charged with attempting to murder police officers
with pipe bombs placed under patrol cars in Los Angeles in 1975.
The bombs, allegedly planted as revenge for the killings of six SLA
members in a Los Angeles police shootout, never went off. She has
said she was not involved in planting the bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Olson was a fugitive until her arrest last year in St. Paul,
Minn. She had married a doctor, had three children and became a
pillar of the community. Her friends and church members posted $1
million for her bail, allowing her to remain free while the case is
pending.

GOP Weighs Primary Schedule Changes
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Republicans who believe their states were practically
shut out of the presidential nominating process are backing a proposal to let
smaller states vote first in early March, with clusters of larger states voting
later through June. But representatives of some of those big states, including
California, Florida, Illinois and Texas, opposed the plan, debated today by the
Republican National Committee's rules panel. A vote was expected tomorrow, when
the RNC's state chairmen's meeting reconvenes.

Bush Pulls Even With Gore Among Women
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George Bush has pulled even with Al Gore in women's
support, helping the Republican edge ahead in a broader survey of likely
presidential voters. Americans say they also feel Bush is more charismatic, has
a better sense of humor and is more inspiring. On the other hand, people in the
new polling said they find Gore, the Democratic vice president, more attractive
and more caring about people. Campaign polls out today suggested that Bush, the
Texas governor, has largely recovered from his slump in the polls in March and
has made gains among several key voter groups.

Review of Miami Mayor Charges Ordered

   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Gov. Jeb Bush assigned a special prosecutor today
to review the flury of accusations made by Miami Mayor Joe Carollo and the
former city manager in the aftermath of the Elian Gonzalez raid. State Attorney
Bernie McCabe, who works in Pinellas and Pasco counties, was assigned to review
whether criminal charges should be brought regarding allegations made by former
Miami City Manager Donald Warshaw and Carollo. Carollo fired Warshaw days after
Warshaw refused to fire former Police Chief William O'Brien, who was alerted to
the April 22 federal raid but did not inform the mayor. O'Brien later resigned.

   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- Driven by swirling wind of up 55 mph, fire rolled
from block to block in abandoned Los Alamos today, burning scores of homes down
to their foundations in the town where the atomic bomb was built. Firefighters
rushed to save houses as orange flames and billowing smoke rose over the town.
Whole neighborhoods were reduced to ruins, with everything from trailers to
mansions going up in smoke in a blaze that had been set by the government to
clear away brush in the wilderness but raged out of control over the weekend.

Sierra Leone Drives Rebels Back
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Sierra Leone soldiers and pro-government
militia drove rebel forces farther from the capital today, an army spokesman
said, as the government moved to head off a feared guerilla offensive on
Freetown. The fighting near the town of Newton, 25 miles east of Freetown, came
as U.N. peacekeeping troops and pro-government forces geared up for a possible
Revolutionary United Front advance on the nervous capital, where thousands of
frightened villagers have sought sanctuary.

shotgun, authorities said. Both were wounded. The officer, who was assigned
part-time to the school, was treated and released from a hospital. The
12-year-old was in stable condition after being shot in the abdomen. Prairie
Grove Superintendent Tom Louks said the boy had skipped school Tuesday and
yesterday after being involved in a dispute Monday. The boy was brought to
school by at least one of his parents today but left shortly after classes

<HEADLINE> Accused Rwanda bishop: I'm a Victim  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- A Roman Catholic bishop accused of
complicity in Rwanda's 1994 genocide on Thursday denied any
responsibility for the massacres, saying he was wrongly arrested on
orders of the former president.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, 56-year-old Augustin Misago faces a mandatory
death sentence on charges that he participated in the meetings
during which the former extremist Hutu government discussed plans
to kill minority Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
   More than 500,000 people were killed between April and July
1994, many of them in churches and with the suspected complicity of
priests and nuns, before the Tutsi-led rebels won power and stopped
the massacres.
</P>
<P>
   In closing arguments, defense attorneys said Misago had no
choice but to attend the security meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he had refused to go, he would've been killed himself,''
said Alfred Pognon, one of Misago's three defense attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, prosecutors said that the presence at the meetings
of Misago -- then the top church authority in the southern Gikongoro
diocese -- meant he was aware of the plans to carry out the
systematic massacres of Tutsis in the region, where tens of
thousands died at the hands of Hutu soldiers, militiamen and
ordinary civilians.
</P>
<P>
   In the highly publicized trial that has strained Rwanda's
relations with the Vatican, Misago is accused of sending three
priests and more than 10 schoolchildren to their deaths by denying
them shelter in his parish.
</P>
<P>
   Misago is the ranking Roman Catholic cleric among more than 20
nuns and priests accused of participating in the genocide. Two
priests have already been convicted and sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in pink prison-issued shirt and shorts with a large
silver cross hanging around his neck on a chain, the tired-looking
Misago insisted on his innocence, and said he was arrested days
after a speech last year by former President Pasteur Bizimungu, who
wrongly linked him to the genocide.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never kept quiet. I wrote to the bishops of Rwanda and the
Vatican about what was happening,'' he said in a brief statement.
''But my witnesses were refused by this court, and even those who
came to testify were intimidated.''
</P>
<P>
   The three-judge panel said it would deliver its verdict on June
15.
</P>
<P>
   More than 125,000 genocide suspects are jailed in Rwanda. More
than 1,500 have been tried so far, and 300 have been sentenced to
death. The first 22 were publicly executed on April 24, 1998.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Defense attorneys have challenged
prosecutors to name the foreign nation for which fired Los Alamos
scientist Wen Ho Lee sought to secure a benefit, as alleged in
federal charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 60, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Taiwan, was fired last
year by Los Alamos National Laboratory and accused of 59 counts of
breaching lab security by transferring files from secure to
unsecure computers and to computer tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Lee is not accused of espionage. But for the government to win a
conviction on the most serious charges against him, prosecutors
must prove he copied weapons secrets to portable data tapes with
the intent of injuring the United States or giving a foreign nation
an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   In a motion filed Wednesday, defense lawyers asked U.S. District
Judge John Conway to make prosecutors name the country for which
Lee allegedly meant to secure an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dr. Lee should not have to guess at such a basic element of
the charges against him,'' wrote attorneys Mark Holscher and John
Cline. ''The prosecution surely knows which 'foreign nation' it
will contend that Dr. Lee intended to benefit. It should not be
permitted to hide the ball on such a critical point.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense strategy will be affected by which country is alleged to
have been Lee's potential benficiary, they said.
</P>
<P>
   If prosecutors contend Lee sought to aid China, Lee's lawyers
said the defense would have to produce experts ''to address the
minimal value that this country's computer codes would have for
(China), given that country's established capability to design and
manufacture nuclear weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney C. Norman Bay has said federal prosecutors don't
have identify which country is the focus of the allegation.
</P>
<P>
   Lee could face life in prison if convicted.

<HEADLINE> 1 Dead, 2 Hurt in Hotel Shooting  </HEADLINE>
By ELISA BONGIOVANNI
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- A gunfight in the hallway of a hotel Thursday
killed one person and wounded two others, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe the three people were the only ones
involved in the shooting, said police Sgt. Earle Lloyd. Two weapons
were found at the scene, and police were trying to determine a
motive.
</P>
<P>
   The victims, believed to be in their thirties, were found on the
third floor of the Fairfield Inn near U.S. 60, said Mary Cameli, a
spokeswoman for the Mesa Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   A woman shot in the chest and a man shot in the face were taken
to a hospital where she was listed in critical condition and he had
non-life threatening injuries, Lloyd said.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel had been 90 percent occupied Wednesday night, though
most guests had likely checked out by the time the shootings
occurred Thursday morning, said Michael Owen, manager for Fairfield
Inns.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm in shock,'' Owen said. ''This is really bad. Nothing like
this has ever happened at any of the hotels I've worked at.''

<HEADLINE> Imprisoned Kidnapper's Son Abducted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Authorities confirmed on Thursday that the
10-year-old son of an imprisoned kidnapper had been abducted.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Arizmendi Suarez, son of Aurelio Arizmendi, was freed and
five suspects were detained Thursday in connection with the boy's
kidnapping, authorities from the Mexican Attorney General's office
said.
</P>
<P>
   Aurelio Arizmendi is imprisoned for kidnapping and mutilating
some of his victims. His wife, Adriana Suarez Arista, was charged
Wednesday with organized crime and owning illegally obtained
property.
</P>
<P>
   When Suarez was arrested on Sunday she first told authorities
her son had been kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizmendi kidnapping band, headed by Daniel Arizmendi,
developed a reputation for cutting off the ears of some of its
victims and sending them to the families to pressure them for
ransom.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizmendi brothers were detained in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos' kidnappers had asked for $2 million for the child,
authorities said.
