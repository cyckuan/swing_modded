<HEADLINE> International Efforts Intensified on Hostage Release in S.Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Diplomatic pressure is mounting on
Sierra Leone' s rebels over the weekend to free the hundreds of
U.N. staff taken hostages.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here from the west African
nation's capital Freetown, Nigerian and Malian delegations had
met with rebel leader Foday Sankoh at his Freetown home, where he
is under surveillance by U.N. soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leonean Information Minister Julius Spencer had earlier
said that head of Libya, Moammar Gadhafi, who has longtime ties
to Sankoh, had also sent a foreign ministry delegation to meet
with Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
In another report, a U.N. spokesman in Freetown was quoted as
saying that a new count had revised the hostage number as 300
other than the former 278. He said there was no fighting reported
Saturday anywhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is better (than Friday) but continues to remain
tense," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of women marched past by Sankoh's house, chanting "We
want peace!" and calling on the rebels to free their hostages,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations also said Saturday that it has lost contact
with another 200 peacekeeping troops in Sierra Leone. They are
soldiers from Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the incident, Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
said Saturday that the Zambians had been captured and apparently
not been harmed.
</P>
<P>
He said it was too early to lay blame for what happened, but
said the group's capture would not affect Zambia's commitment to
the Sierra Leone peace.

<P>
JERUSALEM, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Seven Israeli policemen and at
least two Israeli Arabs were injured on Sunday in clashes during an
independence day celebrations, police said.

<P>
The demonstrators threw stones at police and set fire to cars

the demonstrators after police were injured, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Israel celebrates officially its independence day on Wednesday.
Israeli Arabs have threatened to boycott the event for the first
time in Israel's 52-year history, Israel's Channel One television
said.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Close Palestinian Areas for Holidays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Israel will seal the Palestinian
areas during national holidays of Memorial Day and Independence
Day, preventing Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip from
entering Israel.
</P>
<P>
The closure, which is to last from Monday morning to Thursday
evening, will prevent thousands of Palestinians from reaching their
jobs in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Memorial Day, honoring Israelis who have fallen in battle
and in terrorist attacks, begins Monday night and ends Tuesday
night with celebrations marking the 52nd anniversary of the
founding of Israel. Independence Day ends Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Israel often seals the Palestinian areas during national
holidays as a security measure. But the Palestinians complain that
the measure amounts to collective punishment for them.

ABU DHABI -- The Arab Trade Funding Program (ATFP), an affiliate
of the Abu Dhabi-based Arab Monetary Fund, and Kuwait-Middle East
Bank (KMEP) signed a document under which the former will provide
the latter 20 million U.S. dollars in loan.
</P>
<P>
The loan aims to refund 85 percent of various trade deals
between Kuwait and the Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The document was signed by ATFP Executive Director and Board
Chairman Jassim al-Manaie and KMEP Board Chairman Saleh Mubarak al-

CAIRO -- A recent economic study forcasts the increase of the
Egyptian annual software exports to dlrs 500 million over the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
The current value of exports from this product is estimated at
dlrs 40 million a year.
</P>
<P>
Al-Alam Al-Youm economic daily quoted the study as stating that
the software industry in Egypt involves 1300 foundations where some
10,000 persons are working.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has about 70,000 nationals working in international
software manufacturing companies including 5,000 in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Egyptian trade deficit decreased in the period from
July 1999 to January 2000 by LE 3.7 billion (one dollar equals 3.
435 Egyptian pound) to finally register LE 21.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
Al-Alam Al-Youm quoted the monthly report prepared by the
Cabinet Centre for Information and Decision Supporting, as
referring the reasons of this retreat to the increase of the free
zones' exports by LE 1.118 billion and a coinciding decrease in the
bill of imports by LE 3.52 billion.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egyptians and businessmen expected a thaw in the cash
fluidity crisis and a subsequent gradual recovery of markets over
the next few days. This upbeat tone echoed with the government's
announced pledge to pay off the debts due to the companies. The
debts are estimated at 25 billion pounds.
</P>
<P>
Al-Alam al-Youm reported that the businessmen asked the Central
Bank of Egypt to review the percentage of coverage earmarked for
the bond credits so that this might revitalize the import
activities and break the state of stagnation which has been
gripping the markets.

<HEADLINE> Income Tax In UK At 18-year Peak, Says ITEM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Britons are paying a higher
percentage of income in tax than they have since the early 80s,
says an influential team of economists.
</P>
<P>
A report by accountant Ernst &AMP; Young's ITEM club, says that
Britons will pay 105 billion pounds in income tax this year, equal
to almost 13 percent of average household incomes and the highest
level since 1982.
</P>
<P>
In March, British Prime Minister Tony Blair was forced to admit
that because of indirect taxes, the tax burden had increased under
Labor, despite cuts in basic rate income tax.
</P>
<P>
But the ITEM club says direct taxes on individuals have also
risen because tax thresholds have failed to rise in line with
average pay packets, putting more people in the top 40 percent tax
band.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that the report will be seized on by the
Opposition Party as evidence that Labor is misleading voters over
tax.
</P>
<P>
But the Treasury said: "It is well known that the tax burden is
now falling. The government has introduced a 10p tax band and cut
basic income tax and corporation tax rates."
</P>
<P>
Because of the working family tax credit, working family are
now better off than when Labor came to power,it added.

<HEADLINE> Big Discounts Push Rover Sales To 3-Year High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Rover grabbed its biggest share of
the UK car market for over three years in April as sales more than
doubled.
</P>
<P>
Its sales jumped 116 percent last month to 22,665 compared with
10,467 in April 1999, giving it a 13.5 percent share of the market.
</P>
<P>
It was Rover's best April sales performance for 10 years and
its highest market share since December 1996.
</P>
<P>
John Parkinson, managing director of Rover UK, said:"We are
grateful for the support and loyalty expressed, in convincing
fashion, by the British public to Rover."
</P>
<P>
However, market experts said the surge in Rover sales was
driven by an apparent combination of intense marketing incentives
and concern among buyers for the plight of the group.
</P>
<P>
It was less a case of patriotic fervor and more a response to
huge discounts designed to shift stocks, they added.
</P>
<P>
The rise in Rover sales helped British-built cars take 34
percent of the market. But the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders said the trend was unlikely to last because the continuing
weakness of the euro was putting "immense pressure" on British
business.

<HEADLINE> Eight Kenyan Soldiers Injured in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Eight Kenyan soldiers have been
wounded by rebels in Sierra Leone and 25 others, including a
brigadier and four majors, are being held hostage, Kenyan media
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The figures were disclosed Sunday in the first military
statement on last week's attack on United Nations peacekeepers by
rebels led by Foday Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
Media said that the Sierra Leone rebels were using some 300
captured troops as a human shield and driving in white United
Nations armored carriers as they advanced on the capital,
Freetown.
</P>
<P>
A statement from Kenya's Defence Headquarters for the first
time identified the 33 Kenyan soldiers injured or captured in
Sierra Leone and stated that only two men -- and not four as
reported earlier -- were missing.
</P>
<P>
However, the government has not indicated whether any Kenyan
soldier was killed there.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government is actively engaged in pursuing
diplomatic and other initiatives to ensure the safety and
well-being of the Kenyan troops in Sierra Leone, according to the
statement.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Reject Israeli Redeployment Map </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian chief negotiator in the
final- status talks Yasser Abed Rabbo on Sunday totally rejected
the Israeli-drawn redeployment maps presented in the Eilat talks.
</P>
<P>
Rabbo made the statement after discussing with U.S. Mideast
peace envoy Dennis Ross in the West Bank the maps and the Israeli-
made obstacles against the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Israel proposes to hand over to the Palestinians 66 percent of
the West Bank, according to the maps.
</P>
<P>
"The maps can never be a starting point for the final-status
talks," Rabbo said.
</P>
<P>
The talks focused on the thorniest issues between Israel and the
Palestinians, namely the fate of Jerusalem, borders, water,
refugees, and Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks are going on with the
mediation of Ross and may take a form other than the Eilat talks,
Rabbo told Radio of Palestine, expressing hope that the forthcoming
talks would be more serious.
</P>
<P>
The Eilat talks were adjourned on Saturday. Rabbo, Ross and
Israeli chief negotiator Oded Eran held a tripartite meeting west
Jerusalem on Saturday Evening in an attempt to move the peace talks
forward but no progress was made.
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian-Israeli summit is expected to be held Sunday
Evening in the presence of Ross for the same purpose.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Involvement in Lockerbie Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Sunday rejected allegations by
foreign media that Iranians were involved in the Lockerbie bombing
in 1988.
</P>
<P>
These futile and baseless allegations are totally unacceptable,
Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi was quoted by the
Islamic News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was amazed over the claims made in some interviews
and materials printed by some foreign media, saying the allegations
were made to influence the court hearing, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The bombing of Pan American Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland
in December 1988 killed 259 people in the air and 11 people on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
The trial of two Libyan suspects is currently going on at a

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet Endorses Tax Reform Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli cabinet Sunday endorsed in
principle the tax reform package, which was proposed by a treasury
committee, after a five-hour discussion.
</P>
<P>
The proposals, submitted to Prime Minister Ehud Barak last
Thursday, won the overwhelmingly majority support of 17 cabinet
ministers in a voting.
</P>
<P>
The two abstainers were Labor and Social Affairs Minister Eli
Yishai and Education Minister Yossi Sarid, who both argued that the
budget allocation to implement the tax reform will leave less money
for social reforms.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Finance Ministry Director-General Avi Ben-Bassat, the
major conceiver of the sweeping reform proposals, said the plan
will cost the government tens of millions of Shekels to carry out,
while presenting the recommendations to the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The cost, however, is "marginal" while comparing to the 12
billion Shekels (about 2.92 billion U.S. dollars) of tax revenues
the reform will generate, the director general added.
</P>
<P>
The weekly cabinet meeting also approved a series of interim
orders for preventing speculators from "exploiting the time" gap
between the publication of the reform package and its formal
implementation.
</P>
<P>
It was also decided to create a ministerial committee headed by
Justice Minister Yossi Beilin to supervise the preparation of the
tax reform bill.
</P>
<P>
The committee will hear the ministers' objections regarding the
reform, which had been heard in the past few days, and explore the
possibility of making minor changes in its final embellishment.
</P>
<P>
Most of the ministers generally support the reform, but they
object to some sections of the plan to guard the interests of
respective interests groups they represented.
</P>
<P>
Under the ministerial committee, eight special teams had been
assembled by the Finance Ministry to prepare legislation documents
on the basis of the tax recommendations.
</P>
<P>
The recommendations were building in a framework of introducing
25-percent new taxation on capital gains, such as profits from
stock markets and deposits, to lighten the tax burden of average
wage earners.
</P>
<P>
However, it encounters great criticism due to its abolishing of
a half-point tax exemption for working women and its levying on
continued-education funds for workers.
</P>
<P>
But Barak is the most ardent supporter of the proposals, which
will accomplish one of his major pledges he promised during the
general election in last May.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said at Sunday's meeting that the current tax
reform is an historic step by the government, which will impose
reasonable taxes on the capital market and reduce taxes on wage
earners.
</P>
<P>
These people, who leave each morning to work, form the backbone
of every modern economy and pay the main tax burden. Thus, the tax
reform report reflects sensitivity and is an act of social justice,
a statement issued by Barak's office quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The governmental interim orders for implementing the reform will
be rendered to the Knesset (Parliament) Finance Committee for
confirmation on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The bill itself is expected to go through its first reading in
the next few months and began to be effective by January 1, 2001.

<P>
ABU DHABI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Djiboutian President
Ismael Omar Guelleh on Sunday called on the Arab countries to help
solve the Somali crisis that tore the east African country apart.
</P>
<P>
Guelleh, who is on a visit to the United Arab Emirates (UAE),
said that the Arabs must work for the restoration of peace and
strength of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Djibouti proposed to raise a fund for solidarity with Somalia to
reconstruct the country in line with a scheme like the U.S. "
Marshal Project" for the reconstruction of western Europe after
World War II, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The Arabs should help the Somali people solve their problems,
the president added.
</P>
<P>
On his arrival here, the Djiboutian president said he will
discuss with UAE leaders the bilateral ties and regional and
international issues of common concern. It will provide an
opportunity to brief the UAE leaders on the Djiboutian initiative
of peace in Somalia, he said.

</P>
<P>
The two sides discussed also the U.N. role in the implementation

Shareh said Syria urged the U.N. to play its part in the
implementation of all Security Council resolutions, underscoring
the role of UNIFIL (United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon) in
this regard to abort any Israeli pretext to destabilize the
situation in the region.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian State to Be Declared Before September 13, Qureia Reaffirms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of Palestinian Legislative
Council (PLC) Ahmed Qureia reaffirmed on Sunday that there is "no
option" for the Palestinians except the declaration of an
independent state before the end of 2,000.
</P>
<P>
"We will declare our state and define its borders with Jerusalem
as its capital," Qureia said during his meeting with Secretary
General of International Parliamentary Union Andres Johnson in al-
Beira, the West Bank, Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that an understanding will be reached on this
issue before September 13.
</P>
<P>
The declaration of independence without an agreement with Israel
will mean that a great part of the Palestinians will remain under
the Israeli occupation, Qureia noted. He urged the international
community to put an end to the Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians reject the Israeli claims on the status of
Jerusalem which is part of the Palestinian territories according to
the U.N. resolutions, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
In February the PLC declared determination to establish
Palestinian Statehood by the end of 2,000.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel are scheduled to reach a permanent
peace treaty by September 13 after the settlement of the final
status issues including Jerusalem, the borders, the refugees, water
and the settlements.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians consider September 13 the deadline of
unilateral declaration of statehood with or without a permanent
peace treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Israeli side insists not to hand over or divide
Jerusalem and considers the holy city the "eternal and unified
capital" of the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
On the border issue, the Israeli government said it will not
hand over all the West Bank territories where large Jewish
settlements are still in existence.
</P>
<P>
Israeli negotiators offered to the Eilat talks on Friday a map
on boder demarkation that envisages the transfer of 66 percent of

<HEADLINE> New Shin Bet Head Nomination Approved by Israeli Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli cabinet Sunday approved
the appointment of Avaraham Dichter as new Director of Israel's
General Security Service (Shin Bet).
</P>
<P>
Dichter, currently deputy director of the powerful agency, will
be officially promoted to the post next Sunday, a statement issued
after the weekly cabinet meeting announced.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said at the meeting that
Dichter, a 47-year-old official having grown up through ranks in
the internal security agency, has wide experience and knows all its
areas of operations.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister wished him success in the job, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
A former member of the Israel Defense Forces' elite General
Staff Reconnaissance Unit, Dichter joined the Shin Bet in 1974.
</P>
<P>
Firstly as a bodyguard, he rose step by step and was finally
named as head of the bodyguard unit following the assassination of
former prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, which revealed the agency's
flawed structure.
</P>
<P>
Dichter then served as commander of the southern region of Shin
Bet and later head of training in the Arab Affairs Branch. He was
named deputy of the outgoing director Ami Ayalon last November.
</P>
<P>
Barak Sunday also praised the contribution to the country by
Ayalon, a former Israeli Navy commander who took over his current
post at a difficult time in the wake of the assassination of Rabin
and the wave of terrorist bombings in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Barak stated that Ayalon, who has served for the past four
years, succeeded in his job in an exemplary manner, putting the
Shin Bet back on its feet.

<HEADLINE> US Envoy Mediates for Barak-Arafat Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. special Mideast envoy
Dennis Ross met Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak on Sunday to
bridge wide gaps btween Israel and the Palestinians over the scope
of an emerging Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
The meeting took place ahead of a planned summit later Sunday
between Barak and Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Barak and Arafat are to discuss Israel's delayed handover of
three Palestinian suburbs of Jerusalem, Jewish settlement expansion
in the West Bank and other issues to be resolved in the treaty,
including Palestinian statehood, Palestinian officials said.
</P>
<P>
The officials had said that Ross will sit in on the meeting
scheduled for Sunday night, but U.S. embassy spokesman Larry
Schwartz said later that Ross will not attend.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Palestinians rejected an Israeli proposal for interim
statehood in 66 percent of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in exchange
for postponing negotiations over final borders and the Jerusalem
issue. They fear that if such measures are adopted, negotiations
over the pending issues may drag on for years in the absence of
international pressure.
</P>
<P>
Barak had earlier indicated the willingness to transfer three
villages on the outskirts of Jerusalem, Abu Dis, Azariye and
Swahara, to full Palestinian control as a goodwill gesture prior to
the final Israeli troops withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, which is slated for June. But he later delayed the handover
in the face of opposition from hardliners inside his coalition.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian and Israeli negotiators started a new round of
negotiations on April 30 in the Israeli Red Sea resort city of
Eilat to discuss issues related to the third redeployment and the
outlining of a final status agreement.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who arrived to mediate the peace talks last Wednesday, is
to return to Washington Monday after more talks with negotiators.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Protests to AL Over U.S., British Air Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has informed the Arab League
(AL) of the continuation of the U.S. and British warplanes' air
strikes against its civilian and service facilities, a report said
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to AL Secretary General Ahmed Esmat Abdel-Meguid,
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammad Said Al-Sahaf elaborated the
bombings and violations by U.S. and British planes on April 24-30,
when the U.S. and British jets carried out 195 armed sorties from
their bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Sahaf stressed that these hostilities have become a constant
policy of the U.S. and Britain, with the aim of impinging on Iraq's
sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Iraq "categorically" rejected the so-called two no-fly zones
imposed by the U.S. and Britain in northern and southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British planes have been enforcing the no-fly zones
which were set up shortly after the 1991 Gulf War, with the claimed
aim to protect the Shiite Muslims and Kurds from the forces of
President Saddam Hussein. Iraq has never recognized the two air-
exclusion zones.
</P>
<P>
Sahaf urged the pan-Arab forum to condemn and intervene to stop
the U.S. and British aggressions against Iraq, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq reserves its full right to defend itself and protect its
sovereignty and security," said Sahaf, adding that Iraq demands
compensation from the U.S. and Britain for the "material and moral
damage" it has suffered due to such hostilities.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's air defense artillery have constantly challenged the U.S.
and British planes by targetting the aircraft with surface-to-air
missiles and anti-aircraft artillery.

DAMASCUS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General's envoy Tery
Larsen said here Sunday he has got a promise from Syria to support
the implementation of the U.N. Security Council resolutions No. 425
and 426 after Israel's withdrawal from South Lebanon early July.
</P>

Addressing reporters after his meeting with Syrian Foreign
Minister Faruq al-Shareh, Larsen said they discussed all issues

He described the talks as "very constructive."
</P>
<P>
Larsen noted that the aim of his Middle East tour is to consult
the concerned parties on the implementation of the two resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Shareh and I share the belief that peace can not be
established in the region except through fair and comprehensive
settlement based on the U.N. relevant resolutions including 242 and
338," the U.N. official added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan and Security Council
asserted the importance of establishing such peace, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Larsen pointed out that, after his talks with all concerned
parties in the region, he will table a report to Annan on the
recommendations and requirements for the implementation of all
relevant U.N. resolutions.

MOSCOW, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin said
Sunday that the Victory Day over Nazi Germany "unites and
reconciles everyone in Russia, all ideological and age differences
are subdued by its magnitude."
</P>
<P>
"We are seeking points of support for our society, but we do
not have to seek them far," Putin said before a V-day concert at

"They are so close, they are in the lives of our fathers, the

</P>
<P>
Putin, who was sworn in the new president earlier Sunday, said
moral standards of veterans of the Great Patriot War of 1941-1945
against Nazi Germany "should be our life standards."
</P>
<P>
The veterans not only won a cruel war but also "rebuilt the
country and enabled their children to become educated and compete
with the world's leading states," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
"We are regaining the genuine sense of Fatherland, the very
essence of patriotism. Every time has its soldiers. All of them
are soldiers of Fatherland, soldiers of Russia who are always
ahead at a time trial," the new president said.
</P>
<P>
Today's Russia "also has its soldiers who are worth the heroic
deeds of their fathers and grandfathers," Putin said. "The life
sets many difficult tasks for them, but they are solving the tasks
with honor."

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Tourism Affected by Negative Publicity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The negative publicity Zimbabwe is
receiving abroad continues to affect the tourism industry
especially in the major resort of Victoria Falls where hotel
bookings have dropped by between 60 and 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
Rudy Boribon, general manager of a tourism company called
"Touch the Wild Private Limited", Sunday told the Zimbabwe News
Agency that the drop in tourist arrivals was mainly due to the
picture of insecurity that was being put across by consular travel
 advisors who were picking things from foreign media which were
biased.
</P>
<P>
"Tourists are concerned about their safety when travelling and
they put much emphasis on taking insurance but these are only
given out depending on how safe a country is regarded to be," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Boribon said the drop was first experienced during the fuel
shortage that hit the country late last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mines, Environment and Tourism Minister Simon Moyo
has expressed optimism that the difficulties being faced by the
country were a passing phase.
</P>
<P>
He said the difficulties could be a blessing in disguise for
marketers of tourism in the country because most people around
the world knew something about Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Tourism arrivals had grown by 8 percent from 2.09 million in
1998 to 2. 25 million in 1999 but these were likely to decline
drastically this year.
</P>
<P>
Tourism contributes to about 7 percent of the country's Gross
Domestic Product.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Zimbabwe
International Trade Fair Simba Makoni Sunday called for racial
harmony in the country.
</P>
<P>
He told farmers attending a agricultural show in Bulawayo, the
country's second largest city, that there was need for all
Zimbabweans to rededicate themselves for a new reconciliation
based on national unity, patriotism and mutual respect, local
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said there was no reason for land to be used as a divisive
force that it had now been made, but instead it should be used as
a unifying instrument.
</P>
<P>
His statement came against the background of farm invasions by
ex- combatants and land hungry villagers who are not happy with
the slow pace the land reform program had been moving.
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 white farms were occupied by the ex-combatants
since February this year.
</P>
<P>
Makoni said the government's central policy was not just to
acquire land, but to utilize it as a resource for development and
wealth creation for all the citizens of the country.
</P>
<P>
"Zimbabweans accept the imperative need for a new land order,
not just to redress past injustices, but more to secure and
assure our present and future economic and social well being," he
said.
</P>
<P>
At present, about 4,500 white farmers owned 70 percent of
fertile land of the country.

DAR ES SALAAM, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has claimed the
largest share of Africa's mining investment flow, totaling 400
million U.S. dollars in 1998 following an influx of large scale
gold companies attracted by competitive fiscal and regulatory
mining regime.
</P>

The shooting took place on March 28 last year, shortly after

<P>
MOSCOW, May 7 (Xinhua) -- A monument to former Soviet leader
Josef Stalin was returned Sunday to the main square of Khashuri, a
town in Georgia, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The 2.5-meter monument was removed from its pedestal during the
campaign against Stalin's legacy, but the local people buried it
in the ground instead of destroying it.
</P>
<P>
The monument was unearthed and restored several weeks ago.
After long negotiations, the local veterans' organization and the
United Georgian Communist Party convinced the local authorities to
agree to returning the monument to its original pedestal.
</P>
<P>
Several hundred people attended Sunday's ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"Stalin's cause is still alive," Communist leader and retired
Soviet army general Panteleimon Georgadze said.
</P>
<P>
"Ordinary people get more and more convinced that they were
deceived by so-called democrats in Russia as well as Georgia,"
Interfax quoted him as saying. "The Soviet Union, the great power,
will be restored when people unite around the ideas of Josef
Stalin."
</P>
<P>
Stalin, who was born in 1879 in Georgia, died in 1953. He
served as leader of the Soviet Union and secretary general of the
Soviet Communist Party from 1922 to 1953.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Somali Refugees Under UNHCR's Care  by Zhao Yi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Eight scattered Somali refugee
camps, situated in east Ethiopia's Somali National Regional State,
have been under the good care of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) since their founding in 1988.
</P>
<P>
The state is in a vast stretch of dry land where people and
livestock often have little water to survive during the dry
season, especially in the severe drought period since the late
1990s. Local residents, mainly pastoralists, usually value water
as precious as "gold and diamond".
</P>
<P>
Some 162,000 Somali refugees currently living in the camps
along the Ethio-Somali border are also unavoidably facing the
water shortage problem.
</P>
<P>
However, the refugees apparently enjoy a better water supply as
compared with the local residents thanks to joint efforts made by
the UNHCR and its implementing partners.
</P>
<P>
On the way to two refugee camps -- Hartisheik and Kebribeyah
--, which are 72 kilometers and 55 kilometers separately south of
Jijiga, capital of Somali State, people can hardly see tall trees
and green grass. Instead, groups of donkeys, camels, and
heavy-duty trucks carrying water are seen very often shuttling
between refugee camps, towns and water supply points.
</P>
<P>
"To deliver water to refugee camps and neighboring towns and
villages has become one of our top priorities," said one senior
UNHCR staff in the Jijiga sub-office.
</P>
<P>
For the sake of water supply to the refugee camps of Hartisheik
and Kebribeyah, the UNHCR sank five boreholes 11 years ago in
Jerrer Valley, some 75 kilometers south of Jijiga.
</P>
<P>
Besides, several huge water storage tanks with eight meters in
diameter and three meters in height have also been installed near
the boreholes.
</P>
<P>
Despite the drought disaster hit in Ethiopia recently, the
Somali refugees are still enjoying food rationing in the camps.
</P>
<P>
"Every refugee regardless of sex or age is due to get once a
month 12kg of wheat, 1.05kg of edible oil, 750g of sugar and 150g
of salt provided by the World Food Program of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"We also encourage the refugees to make use of the open ground
in the camps to plant crops to complement their rations, " the
senior UNHCR staff said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the stated minimum supplies to the refugees,
medical services are made available in every refugee camp. The
patients suffering from common diseases like malaria, pneumonia
etc. or malnutrition can be treated in the health center free of
charge.
</P>
<P>
Besides, ambulances are available for taking the serious cases
to hospitals in Jijiga, Dire Dawa, the second largest city in
Ethiopia, or even the capital city of Addis Ababa when necessary,
according to the UNHCR official.
</P>
<P>
In the health center in Hartisheik Refugee Camp, dozens of
severely malnourished children under 5 years old, mostly the
displaced Ethiopian children, were admitted and treated under the
therapeutic feeding program.
</P>
<P>
The food provided by the center include therapeutic milk, rice,
 spaghetti, meat, vegetables and famix (the mixture of edible oil,
sugar and other nourishment), said chief of the health center
Bekele Negussie.
</P>
<P>
It might be a surprise to someone that the UNHCR's protection
and assistance to the refugees is by no means limited to the
distribution of food and water to them, but is also to cover
education service.
</P>
<P>
"To provide the refugees with education service is a must in
every refugee camp," said Tsegaye Mehiratu, zonal coordinator of
the Administration for Refugee and Returnee Affairs, which is the
UNHCR's leading implementing partner in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Of all the eight refugee camps in Somali State, there is none
that does not have a school, Tsegaye said, noting that the total
enrollment of the schools has come up to more than 6,000
students.
</P>
<P>
The primary school in Hartisheik Refugee Camp is a school with
a dozen of classrooms and a fairly big sport ground in the school
compound -- hardly seen any difference from schools in other
places.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim Abudullohi Salapan, former headmaster of the school,
said less than 700 refugee pupils were enrolled in the school due
to lack of classrooms and furniture, and that the pupils had to
attend the school in two shifts, one in the morning and the other
in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Despite of various difficulties, he said, the school teachers
have managed to offer the pupils many courses, including
arithmetics, social science, natural science, arts and sports in
addition to Somali, Amharic, English and Arabic languages.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the UNHCR attaches great importance to the
education of environmental rehabilitation and protection, and
regards it as a major subject in the curriculum.
</P>
<P>
The fact is notable that the UNHCR-sponsored education of
environment protect is based upon practice in the field rather
than sermon in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 and 1998, the UNHCR Jijiga sub-office established a
nursery in every refugee camp. Ever since then, some 500,000
saplings have been raised in the nurseries and planted annually in
and around the camps, according to Abdirazak Abdinahi, an official
from the Bureau of Agriculture (one of the UNHCR implementing
partners in Jijiga) said.
</P>
<P>
To reduce deforestation by the refugees, the UNHCR has also
introduced to the refugee camps a kind of energy-saving stove made
of volcanic ashes and cement. The stove saves at least one third
of firewood as compared with the traditional stove commonly used
by the Somalis.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR officials have also made an interesting decision that
the distribution of the stoves is linked with tree planting: The
stove is given only to the refugees who are active in planting
trees.
</P>
<P>
The Somalis who are taking refuge in the eastern Ethiopia are
lucky enough as they are able to enjoy the UNHCR's care.
</P>
<P>
However, as the saying goes, "East, west, home is the best." As
the political situation in northwest Somalia has become stable,
more and more Somali refugees have become homesick, and are eager
to return home.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics by the Jijiga sub-office, as many as
85,000 Somali refugees have so far registered for repatriation
following the voluntary repatriation of 92,000 refugees since
1997.
</P>
<P>
The demographic figure shows that in Ethiopia the number of
UNHCR- registered Somali refugees has dropped from 450,000 in
years between 1988 and 1991 to the present 162,000.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- China's metallurgical industry will
focus its readjustment of product mix on developing and producing
more quality steel products, a senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Pu Haiqing, director of the State Administration of
Metallurgical Industry, said at the Congress "Steel 2000", that
most steel products China imports are of a high quality, such as
stainless and rolled sheet.

China is the world's largest steel producer with steel output
exceeding 100 million tons in the past four years. However, the
country still has to import some seven million tons of steel
products for special use.
</P>
<P>
The industrialization process in China, is placing huge demand
on the steel industry and higher quality and better services, Pu
said.
</P>
<P>
Sectors including automobiles, machinery products, household
appliances, petroleum and communications all needs high quality
steel products for upgrading, he added.
</P>

<HEADLINE> HK Official Calls for Higher Efficiency of Financial Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Asian countries were urged to
examine how to promote the provision and use of credit enhancement
facilities for Asian bond issues in order to develop the regional
bond market, according to a news releases by the Hong Kong
government's Information Services Department.
</P>
<P>
The news release cited Joseph Yam, chief executive of the Hong
Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), as saying that the efficiency of
financial markets in the region in performing the important
function of financial intermediation has been found lacking.
</P>
<P>
"There has been notably little disagreement about the
desirability of developing domestic and regional bond markets, but
there had also been little progress," Yam said when speaking for
Hong Kong at the 33rd Annual Meeting of Asian Development Bank (
ADB) held in Chiang Mai, Thailand.
</P>
<P>
There has been no lack of explanation of why this is the case,
Yam said. The often quoted impediments include the lack of
clearing and settlement infrastructure, the absence of a broad
institutional investor base, the lack of a benchmark yield curve,
low liquidity, and so on, he added.
</P>
<P>
While these impediments are recognized and are being tackled
earnestly by national authorities, there is one problem that has
attracted relatively little attention so far. The problem relates
to the generally low credit ratings of the Asian issuers,
including the sovereigns, granted by the international rating
agencies, the HKMA chief said.
</P>
<P>
Yam pointed out that many Asian governments and corporations
receive credit ratings that are lower than the minimum thresholds
acceptable to institutional investors, including the managers of
official reserves.
</P>
<P>
"I think there is a need to consider the introduction of market-
based mechanisms for credit enhancement or guarantees," Yam said.
"We have learnt from recent years of financial turmoil and I hope
we are now in a better position to identify and therefore properly
price the risks involved in the provision of credit enhancements
or guarantees," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that there was certainly merit in strengthening
the dialogue between the Asian issuers and the international
credit agencies to facilitate a better understanding of the Asian
situation by the rating agencies and improve the transparency and
accountability of the rating process.
</P>
<P>
He said that there was also a case for considering whether it
is advisable or viable to establish national or regional credit
rating agencies, with or without support from the authorities.
</P>
<P>
Yam noted ADB's contribution to the region's impressive
development record. He looked forward to greater involvement of
the Bank, in the development of Asia as it stepped into a new era
in which technology presents an abundance of opportunities as well
as risks.

<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- About 46 million people in China
toured the country during the first week-long Labor Day holidays.
</P>
<P>
This figure far exceeds that of people who traveled the country
during the National Day last year, when 40 million people went out.
</P>
<P>
During the Labor Day holidays, most scenic spots were swamped
with tourists. Nearly three million tourists came to Beijing while
1.78 million Beijing residents traveled outside the city,
according to tourist authorities.
</P>
<P>
Transportation also hit a new record. From May 1 to 3, trains
carried 4 million passengers per day, surpassing the number of
people who traveled during the peak of the Spring Festival.
Although 79 extra special trains and 274 temporary trains were put
into operation, they could not meet the demand. The number of
passengers that flew during the holiday reached 1.7 million, up 34
percent over that in the Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that some 2 billion yuan were spent by tourists
each day, generating 18 billion yuan for the domestic tourism
industry.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Calls for National Unity and Stability (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- People's Daily, the leading
newspaper of the Communist Party of China (CPC), will publish a
commentary tomorrow, calling on the entire nation to ensure unity
and stability for the rejuvenation of China.
</P>
<P>
The article coincides with the first anniversary of the U.S.-
led NATO bombing of the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia on May 8,
1999, resulting in heavy casualties and serious damage of the
embassy building.
</P>
<P>
"The same day one year ago, the U.S.-led NATO raided the
Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia with missiles during its aggressive
war against Kosovo," it says, adding the bombing "shocked the
whole world."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government lodged a statement to severely condemn
the atrocity and demanded the U.S.-led NATO be held fully
accountable. Meanwhile, the Chinese people nationwide also staged
protest activities.
</P>
<P>
All peace-loving and just governments, organization and people
worldwide also condemned the brutal act and expressed their
support, it says.
</P>
<P>
In face of the arrogance and hegemonist behavior, the Chinese
people "were not frightened or crashed," the article says. On the
contrary, the brutal acts "triggered an outburst of patriotism,
determined the iron will of the Chinese people, and rejuvenated
their high zeal for construction."

<P>
Everything is determined by strength, and hegemonism ventures
to grossly interfere in the internal affairs of other countries
and even launch wars and destroy peace because it has powerful
economies and military forces, the article points out.
</P>
<P>
"Why we can achieve triumph in opposing the hegemonic acts by
the U.S.-led NATO lies in the fact that the Chinese people has
stood up. The Chinese nation has become stronger and more
prosperous," the commentary says, adding that the struggle has
enabled the Chinese people to be more determined to focus on
economic developments.
</P>
<P>
Facing competitions in the economic, technological and national
defense areas worldwide, it is imperative for China to concentrate
on developing advanced science and technology and strengthening
its economy and national defense, it says.
</P>
<P>
Only in this way, can China never be defeated, it adds.
</P>
<P>
International hostile forces continue to put pressure on China,
and engage in "westernizing China" and "separating China", it
points out, adding that it is imperative for China to maintain
unity and stability to deal with this.

day by day, and no forces can do anything harmful to us," it says.
</P>
<P>
"There should be unity and stability in China," it adds.
</P>
<P>
Reform and opening-up is the way toward building a strong and
prosperous country, it notes, adding that in today's world, multi-
polarity is moving forward, and peace and development are the will
of the people.
</P>
<P>
"We should make full use of favorable opportunities, and
promote exchanges and cooperation with other countries, and firmly
pursue an independent foreign policy of peace, and develop
friendship and cooperation with other countries on the basis of
the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence," it says.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China firmly opposes hegemonism, and will never make
any concession on the matters relating to national sovereignty,
dignity and security while pursuing cooperation with other
countries, including western countries, in all areas based on the
Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, it says.
</P>
<P>
Nothing can stop the Chinese people from rejuvenating their
nation no matter how difficult the road ahead is, the commentary
says, urging the entire Chinese people to work harder to build a
strong, prosperous, democratic and culturally advanced socialist
country under the leadership of the Communist Party of China
Central Committee with President Jiang Zemin at the core.

While calling for justice, development and powerfulness,
students firmly supported the solemn stance of the government, the
article says.
</P>
<P>
"We can never be bullied," the Chinese people say. Workers,
farmers, cadres, intellectuals and people from all walks of life
all determined to unify more closer around the CPC with Jiang
Zemin at the core, adhere to the basic theory and guideline of the
Party, unswervingly push forward the reform and opening-up, and
make efforts to ensure the social stability, it says.
</P>
<P>
Officers and soldiers from the People's Liberation Army and the
armed police all expressed their willingness to accelerate the
modernization drive of army and safeguard the state sovereignty,
dignity and security at any time even at the price of their blood
and lives.
</P>
<P>
The article highly commended such unity amidst severe
challenges and ordeal, saying that all these demonstrated "the
great patriotism and cohesiveness of the Chinese nation and their
willingness to safeguard world peace and oppose hegemonism."

Hegemonism makes trouble in the world so it must be opposed in

once and again during the struggle of the Chinese people in the
past one and a half centuries and this was proved again in this
struggle against U.S.-led NATO, the article says.

"Peace and development constitute the mainstream of the

continues for one more day, the whole world will not be in peace."

the establishment of a just and fair international new economic

<HEADLINE> Western Development is Long-term Task, Li Peng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, May 7 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislator Li Peng urged
leading officials at all levels to harness the Yellow River and
accelerate the development of western China in an orderly way
during a recent inspection tour to northwest China's Shaanxi
Province.
</P>
<P>
This is because the government strategy of developing China's
western regions and harnessing the Yellow River is a long-term
task of strategic importance. It requires arduous efforts of
several generations, said Li Peng, chairman of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Shaanxi from May 2 to 7, Li met with 21
model workers, visited Xi'an New and High-tech Development Zone
and inspected some factories and tourist sites.
</P>
<P>
Development of western China is a decision of great
significance. It provides a golden opportunity for the development
of provinces and autonomous regions in the region, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He called on local governments adopt measures to local
conditions and work in a down-to-earth manner. The tendency of
rushing headlong into mass actions should be avoided.
</P>
<P>
In the development of western China, stress will be laid on
construction of highways, railways, water conservancy and power
projects, he said. Shaanxi Province, which is endowed with rich
coal and gas resources, should accelerate the construction of
energy bases and electricity transmission.
</P>
<P>
Protection of the environment is an important aspect of
developing the west, and the pressing task is to harness the
Yellow River, Li pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Seeing the bare mountain slopes during the tour, Li said
effective efforts should be taken to galvanize farmers in growing
trees and grass.
</P>
<P>
Li also urged Shaanxi to tap its potential in energy, science
and technology, military industry and tourism development, seek
more foreign investment, speed up infrastructure projects and
build more scenic sites.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi should redouble its efforts to promote management and
new working methods to ensure the smooth development of China's
western regions, Li said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet Began Deliberation on Tax Reform Proposals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli cabinet Sunday began its
deliberation on the tax reform recommendations proposed by an
Israeli treasury committee last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the weekly cabinet meeting, the government is
expected to endorse the sweeping tax reform package in principle,
approve interim orders to implement the reform immediately, and
render these orders to the Knesset (Parliament) Finance Committee
on Monday for confirmation, source in Prime Minister's Office said.
</P>
<P>
Avi Ben-Bassat, Director General of the Finance Ministry, and
other committee members presented their recommendations to the
cabinet ministers before they began discussion.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Bassat, the major conceiver of the committee report,
revealed at the presentation remarks that the reform plan will cost
the government tens of millions of Shekels to carry out.
</P>
<P>
But comparing to the 12 billion Shekels (about 2.92 billion U.S.
dollars) of tax revenues the reform will generate, the cost is "
marginal", Ben-Bassat added.
</P>
<P>
The Ben-Bassat committee was established eight months ago to
accomplish Prime Minister Ehud Barak's election pledges to
correct "historic income tax distortions."
</P>
<P>
It recommended last Thursday that a 25-percent tax should be
levied on real profits made from stock trading, short-and medium-
term interest-bearing savings plans, and continued-education funds.
</P>
<P>
The taxation is aimed to offset the state's loss of tax revenue
due to income tax reform, in which the take-home pay of middle-
class wage earners will be increased.
</P>
<P>
The reform plan garnered general support from a decisive
majority of ministers. However, most of them issued their
reservations to certain articles in the proposal, guarding the
interests of respective interest groups they represent.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's cabinet session is to provide a platform for these
ministers to express their opinion more openly, which the Finance
Ministry promised to take into account in its further burnishing of
the report, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
The most criticized sections of the recommendations are the
abolishment of a half-point tax exemption of working women and the
taxation of continued-education funds of average workers.
</P>
<P>
The Histadrut, or Jewish Labor Federation, organized a one-
hour "warning strike" against the taxation of continued-education
funds on Sunday morning, involving about 1.5 million employees from
Israel Radio, Israel Electric, Ports, Airports and Railway
Authorities, banks, and government offices throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Histadrut leader Amir Peretz said the work stoppage was just the
first step against the tax reform, which he claimed contains "land
mines and traps" for low-income workers.
</P>
<P>
In a related front, Israel's High Court had order the finance
minister to submit explanations by 5 p.m. Sunday (0200 GMT) to
justify its administrative order to block the banks to open new
saving plans.
</P>
<P>
The order, issued by Finance Minister Avraham Shohat last
Thursday, was to prevent investors from "exploiting the time" gap
between the publication of the reform package to its formal
implementation, which will impose a 25-percent tax to the deposits.
</P>
<P>
However, Knesset member Avigdor Lieberman appealed to the High
Court last Friday, asking it to nullify the order, which he argued
is against Savings Encouragement Law and Basic Law: Freedom of
Occupation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Finance Minister had assembled eight special
teams to prepare legislation on the basis of the tax
recommendations, which is expected to go through its first reading
in the next few months and began to be effective by January 1,
2001.

<P>
TEHRAN, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The ground forces of Iran's elite
Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) on Sunday launched a two-
day military maneuvers in the central Kerman province.
</P>
<P>
A commander at the maneuver scene told the Islamic Republic News
Agency that the war game was aimed at boosting the forces'
defensive capabilities with employment of modern equipment.
</P>
<P>
He said that the maneuver would be carried out in three stages
in which the IRGC forces would launch offensive operations in 48
hours into the positions of the hypothetical enemies.
</P>
<P>
Some 2500 targets of the hypothetical enemies would be bombed in
the exercises, the commander said, adding that the IRGC ground
forces, armored division and air force would take part in the
military game.
</P>
<P>
The IRGC ground force commander Brigadier-General Mohammad Ali
Jaafari said Wednesday that the IRGC forces would launch three
separate maneuvers in Kerman province, Khorramshahr of southwestern
Khuzestan province and Najafabad, the central Isfahan province to
mark the recovery of Khorramshahr in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
The exercises will include testing of the advanced military
hardware and boosting preparedness for rapid deployment operations
in the eastern and southern borders, he said.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Continue Operations Against Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
vowed Sunday to continue military operations against the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) in Mindanao in the southern part
of the country.
</P>
<P>
"If they (MILF) want peace we will give them peace, but we will
never allow ourselves to be threatened," Estrada said in Zamboanga
City, Mindanao, where he was assessing the situation since
hostilities broke out between government forces and MILF a week
ago.
</P>
<P>
"We will protect our national sovereignty, and we will do so
even at the cost of our lives," he said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said the government is giving out everything to the
people of Mindanao and the rebels must now stop its fight so "we
can work together in peace."
</P>
<P>
"We will not tolerate terrorism and any threat to the country,
and we will apply the full force of the law."
</P>
<P>
In Zamboanga, Estrada visited soldiers, who were wounded in a
week-long fighting with MILF rebels, and comforted hostages who
were rescued by government troops four days ago.
</P>
<P>
But Estrada said nothing about the ceasefire proposed by the
MILF.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, MILF Vice Chairman for Military Affairs Al Haj
Murad declared a 48 hour unilateral ceasefire which took effect at
06:00 Saturday (22:00 GMT Friday).

LAGOS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Tensions are mounting in the capital
Freetown of the war-torn Sierra Leone as reports claimed that the

United Nations peacekeepers, marched onto the capital, sources

in defiance of the peace agreement signed last year by the
government and the rebels in Lome, capital of Togo.
</P>
<P>
However, Winslow retracted earlier U.N. statements that the
rebel were on the outskirts of the capital which caused U.N. and
foreign aid workers to take refuge in hotel for possible
evacuation.
</P>
<P>
Fighting between U.N. peacekeepers and the rebels on Saturday
was confirmed by U.N. officials.
</P>
<P>
Reports of the rebel advance towards the capital revived
memories of a bloody battle in January 1999 when a Nigerian-led
West African intervention force prevented rebels from taking the
city. An estimated 5,000 people died in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
U.N. officials said about 300 U.N. peacekeepers or civilian
support staff had been held hostages by the rebels and another 200
U.N. soldiers had been lost contact.
</P>
<P>
However, a joint statement issued Saturday in Freetown claimed
that the rebels and the U.N. peacekeeping force had agreed to send
a joint mission on Sunday to areas where the hostages allegedly
held.
</P>
<P>
The progress was made after the Saturday talks between the
rebel leader Foday Sankoh and special representative Oluyemi
Adeniji of the U.N. secretary-general for Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
"Both parties showed a high level of understanding and
responsibility to push the peace process forward," said the
statement.

<HEADLINE> Kasyanov Named Russian Acting Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin on
Sunday named First Deputy Prime Minster and Finance Minster
Mikhail Kasyanov as acting prime minister, the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The appointment came shortly after Putin's inauguration
ceremony at the Kremlin earlier Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Kasyanov, 42, has long been seen as the most probable candidate
for the premiership which Putin held before his inauguration.
</P>
<P>
Putin will soon submit Kasyanov's candidacy to the State Duma (
lower house of the parliament) and an easy approval is expected,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The current cabinet has tendered its resignation under the
Russian constitution.
</P>
<P>
Kasyanov, born on December 8, 1957, in the Solntsevo region of
Moscow, was educated at the Moscow Automobile and Road College in
1983, majoring in construction engineering.
</P>
<P>
After serving in the army, he used to work for a transportation
research center associated to the former Soviet Union's State
Committee for Construction.
</P>
<P>
In 1981-1990, Kasyanov worked at the Soviet State Planning
Committee, first as an engineer, later as a senior economist,
chief expert and section chief.
</P>
<P>
From 1991 to 1993, Kasyanov served Russia's Ministry of
Economics on various posts and became head of the Finance
Ministry's foreign debt department in 1993.
</P>
<P>
He became deputy finance minister in 1995 and was named finance
minister in May 1999.
</P>
<P>
After former president Boris Yeltsin's surprise resignation on
December 31, 1999, Kasyanov was appointed first deputy prime
minister by then acting president Putin to look after the day-to-
day operation of the cabinet.

<HEADLINE> Barak: Pullout Not to Affect Fighting Cross-Border Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
said here Sunday that the withdrawal from south Lebanon will not
affect Israel's capability to retaliate any cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Barak told the cabinet that the government is ready to provide
more economic assistance to the residents of the confrontation line
along the northern border.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet met Sunday to discuss recent developments in the
north, particularly the tense situation following Hezbollah's
rocket attacks last weekend against northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Hezbollah, or Party of God, fired 40 Katyusha
rockets on northern Israel and 20 of them landed at Israel's
norther border town of Kiryat Shmona, killing one Israeli solider
and wounding 25 others.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh warned the Syrians on
Sunday against backing Hezbollah to conduct military activities
against northern Israel. Israel will retaliate sharper against any
such activities, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sneh also said the defense ministry is requesting the government
to allocate some 35 million shekels (about 8.75 million U.S.
dollars) in the near future as special funds to help the northern
residents to cope with the economic and security problems.
</P>
<P>
This allocation will be part of the 450 million U.S. dollars the
government prepared for the northern residents to cope with
economic and security problem after Israel's pullout from south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Among the items in the aid package is a 76.25 million U.S.
dollar program to build alternative roads to those abutting the
border.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of residents of Kiryat Shmona demonstrated in the
town's center on Sunday, calling on the government to improve
economic and security conditions.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators burnt tires on the main road through the town,
saying the government should take stronger action in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In the last two days, situation in northern Israel has turned to
normal as Hezbollah and Israel exercised restraint and no exchange
fire was reported so far.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, backed by Iran and Syria, is the main military group
in Lebanon fighting against Israeli occupation which started 22
years ago.

<HEADLINE> Ferry Sinks in Indonesia, Kills 21 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- A least 21 persons died when a ferry
sank in the Tanjung Tial waters near Indonesia's Maluku provincial
capital Ambon on Sunday, Antara news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The ferry, heading from Gudang Arang port Waipirit port near
Ambon, sank at 10:00 a.m. local time when sailing on the Tanjung
Tial waters, some 40 kilometers east of Ambon, Antara said.
</P>
<P>
An official confirmed that 21 bodies had been found until 02:00
p.m. Security apparatus and local people living around the Tanjung
Tial coastal area are still looking for the other passengers of
the ill-fated ferry which might have carried hundreds of
passengers, overloading its capacity.
</P>
<P>
So far, the owner of the ferry or the related institutions
reached for confirmation have not given any detailed information
on the ferry.
</P>
<P>
According to Ano Tuatanasse, an eye witness, the ferry actually
left the Gudang Arang port on Saturday at 07:00 p.m., but waters
flooded into the ferry when it reached on the Air Salobar waters,
some two kilometers from Gudang Arang port.
</P>
<P>
"The captain then decided to go back to the port," said Ano who
managed to flee from the incident after swimming for hours with
his three friends.
</P>
<P>
The ferry was then sailed again on Sunday at 03:00 a.m. after
loading three cars, he added.
</P>
<P>
A truck driver taking part in the sail said when the ferry
reached Tial Bay waters, a wave three to five meters high hit the
ferry, damaging its left door.
</P>
<P>
"The second wave was the one that sank our ferry," he added.

<HEADLINE> Arsenic Level Alarming in Bangladesh's Drinking Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Arsenic level in drinking water
sources reached a dangerous mark in 918 villages of Bangladesh,
according to a study released here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted by researchers of Dhaka Community Hospital
and the School of Environmental Studies of India's Jadavpur
University, claimed that Bangladesh's arsenic calamity was one of
the most virulent throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
The researchers analyzed 22,003 tube well water samples from 64
districts in the country, and their results in five years up to
February, 2000 showed that arsenic level in ground water was above
0.01 mg per liter in 54 out of the 64 districts, and in 47
districts it was above 0.05 mg per liter.
</P>
<P>
A total of 918 villages have been identified to be above the 0.
05-mg-per-liter level.
</P>
<P>
The researchers said that so far they had analyzed around 11,
000 hair, nail, urine and skin-scale samples from affected
villages, and over 90 percent of the people tested arsenic
positive in their hair, nail and urine.
</P>
<P>
Of the 17,896 people examined at random from the affected
villages, 3,688 tested skin-lesion positive, the study report said.
</P>
<P>
The researchers feared that it was only the tip of an iceberg
of the actual calamity.
</P>
<P>
"The more we survey, the more we find people suffering from
arsenic skin lesion," they said.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Contribute ADB 10 Bln Yen for Poverty Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHIANG MAI, Thailand, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government
will contribute 10 billion yen (92.5 million U.S. dollars) for
setting up a fund within the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for
poverty reduction to support the bank's fight against poverty,
Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa announced here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech at the 33rd Annual Meeting of the Board of
Governors of the ADB, Miyazawa said the fund aims to provide
grants in relation to the bank's loans to reduce poverty and also
to support capacity-building efforts.
</P>
<P>
"By drawing upon this fund, we hope that the bank's loans for
poverty reduction will become even more effective," he said.
</P>
<P>
Agreeing with the bank's strategy of refocusing on its work
with the overarching goal of eliminating poverty from the region,
he expects that the strategy will be translated into day-to-day
operations of the bank to support those who could not fully
benefit from economic growth in the past.
</P>
<P>
To guarantee the successful implementation of the poverty
reduction strategy, Miyazawa said the bank should conduct a
continuous dialogue -- not only with governments in the developing
countries but also with other stakeholders, including the members
of civil society at large.
</P>
<P>
He urged the ADB to enhance coordination with the World Bank
and bilateral aid agencies, strengthen the capacity of its
organization as well as that of its own staff, and implement
measures to promote the sense of ownership in the developing
countries, to expand poverty related database and to reinforce its
monitoring.
</P>
<P>
Miyazawa also talked about the future role of the ADB and the
need for a long-term strategy for the future.
</P>
<P>
He said the crises in the emerging economies have prompted a
heated debate about the reform of the International Monetary Fund
and the World Bank and other international financial institutions,
and how their functions should be adjusted to the changing world
economy.
</P>
<P>
"Reform of the World Bank, in particular, will have significant
implications on the bank, its partner for Asian development," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the ADB to seriously consider how to respond, as
a regional bank, to the decentralization of the World Bank, what
role it should play in supporting the emerging market countries
with the access to the international capital markets and how it
can provide more active and effective support to private sector
development.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, focusing on poverty reduction, opened on Saturday
in this mountainous city, some 1,000 kilometers north of Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 representatives from most of the bank's 58 members,
including finance ministers, central bank governors and officials
from banks and international financial institutions, are attending
the three-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Board of Governors, the ADB's highest policy-making body,
comprises one representative from each member and meets annually.
</P>
<P>
The board elects the Board of Directors every two years.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the bank is also holding seminars on issues
ranging from poverty reduction and the international financial
architecture to the global networked economy.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1966, the ADB is a multinational finance
institution. With 42 of its members from the Asian and Pacific
region, the bank engages in a wide range of social and economic
development activities aimed at improving the welfare of the
people in the region.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the ADB rededicated itself to the fight against
poverty by adopting a new poverty reduction strategy that rests on
three pillars: pro-poor, sustainable economic growth, social
development and good governance.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Starts Pilot Demobilization Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPOT, Cambodia, May 7 (Xinhua) -- A total of 128 soldiers
were demobilized Sunday at a discharge center in Kampot province
under Cambodia's pilot demobilization project.
</P>
<P>
It was the first batch of the 250 military personnel to be
discharged from the army in Kampot. The second batch of 122 will
be demobilized in four days.
</P>
<P>
Present at Sunday's inauguration of the Pilot Demobilization
Program were Sok An, minister of the Council of Ministers and
chairman of the Council for the Demobilization of Armed Forces (
CDAF), Tea Banh and Sisowath Sirirath, co-ministers of National
Defense, diplomats, as well as representatives from international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The armed forces personnel to be demobilized are from a special
target group, comprising chronically ill soldiers, disabled,
elderly and some regular forces. Most of those to be demobilized
are no longer in the barracks and have already returned to their
respective community.
</P>
<P>
According General Secretary of the CDAF Svay Sitha, of the 250
soldiers, 26 are female, 69 are disabled, 47 are chronically ill
and 30 are elderly.
</P>
<P>
Each demobilized soldier got the government cash allowances of
Cambodian riel equivalent to 240 U.S. dollars, as well as other
kinds of assistance including 150 kilograms of rice, canned fish,
salt and cooking oil which were contributed by the U.N. World Food
Program, and some items of the household kits provided by Germany.
</P>
<P>
Some discharged soldiers told reporters that they supported the
government's demobilization program. "We are looking forward to
being ordinary people after the country has a complete peace
environment. It is good for our country as well as ourselves,"
said one of them called Sam Som. But some others worried that they
would lead a harder life with so litter money.
</P>
<P>
After the discharge ceremony, the 128 discharged soldiers and
their families were transported to the communities where they
chose to settle down.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,500 soldiers will be demobilized in four provinces
under the pilot program. After Kampot, Kampong Thom will discharge
460 soldiers from May 16 to May 22, to be followed by Banteay
Meanchey which is to demobilize 370 soldiers from June 12 to 17
and Battambang which will demobilize 420 soldiers from June 22 to
the end of that month.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that a total of 31,500 soldiers will be
demobilized beginning this year until 2002.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Russian President Vladimir Putin  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Vladimir Putin was sworn in as
Russia's new president in a ceremony at the Kremlin on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Born on October 7, 1952, in Leningrad, now St. Petersburg,
Putin was the only child of a factory foreman and his wife who
were both reportedly decorated war veterans.
</P>
<P>
He was enrolled in martial arts classes by his parents. By 16,
he was a top-ranked expert at sambo, a Russian combination of judo
and wrestling dating from the 1930's. He was Leningrad's judo
champion in 1974.
</P>
<P>
Putin entered School 281, an elite college-preparatory
institution where only students with near-perfect grades could get
in.
</P>
<P>
As he was finishing his studies as a law student at Leningrad
State University, Putin was approached by a professional recruiter
for the KGB. Shortly after, he started an about 16-year career
with the intelligence establishment. Putin was the only one picked
up by the KGB of the 100 or more students in the class of 1975 in
the Leningrad law school.
</P>
<P>
Besides the law degree, Putin also has a doctorate in
economics from Russia's oldest technical university. He speaks
some English and such impressive German that he can imitate
dialects.
</P>
<P>
Putin returned to Leningrad from Germany in the early 1990s
and took up work in the international affairs department at his
alma mater. He later became a first deputy governor of Leningrad
under his mentor, Anatoly Sobchak, handling all foreign trade and
business in the second largest Russian city.
</P>
<P>
He was praised as "one of the more honest and decent people in
the St. Petersburg government" and credited for significant
foreign investment projects there in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, when Sobchak lost his political campaign, Putin
resigned from the city government and later moved to Moscow to
work in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
In July 1998, he was appointed head of the Federal Security
Service, the main successor to the KGB. In March 1999 his duties
were expanded to include running the Kremlin Security Council, a
top advisory body that includes ministers of the so-called power
ministries.
</P>
<P>
Five months later, he was handpicked by then President Boris
Yeltsin to become the country's fifth prime minister in about 18
months. Then, he became acting president after Yeltsin's abrupt
resignation on December 31.
</P>
<P>
Putin's tough-guy image and forceful, no-nonsense style, as
displayed in handling Chechnya, won him mounting support among
Russians who are frustrated by the chaos and the woes accumulated
over the years since the disintegration of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Many pin their hopes on the young and energetic Putin to lift
Russia from the ashes, and restore the national pride.
</P>
<P>
Putin is married, with two teenage daughters. He does not
smoke, rarely drinks, and regularly works 16 to 17 hours a day.

<HEADLINE> mee050702hke --- Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Israeli newspapers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Lebanese government has raised a potential obstacle to
Israel's proposal to withdrawal from the security zone in south
Lebanon by demanding Israel also to withdraw from the region of
Sheba village, about 16 kilometers east of Metulla, the foothills
of Mount Hermon.
</P>
<P>
Until now, the area has not been considered Lebanese territory,
but rather, part of it might be conceded to Syria as part of a
peace agreement with Damascus.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon is apparently making the demand on the insistence of the
Syrians, who are opposed to Israel's plans for a unilateral
withdrawal. According to diplomatic sources, if the condition is
not met, Lebanon will consider the withdrawal incomplete.
</P>
<P>
Ha'arez
</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli government is to authorize transitional
regulations on Sunday to implement a sweeping tax reform based on
the report by the Treasury's Ben-Bassat Commission. The regulations
will be presented to the Knesset's (parliament's) Finance Committee
on Monday for confirmation.
</P>
<P>
A decisive majority of ministers is expected to confirm the
Finance Ministry's formal request to authorize the interim orders.
</P>
<P>
If the tax-reform proposal is approved by the government and the
committee later this year, taxes on various savings plans would go
into effect retroactively from Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian National
Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat are expected to meet in the next
few days to advance the talks on the final status arrangement and
the third redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Barak will not submit to the cabinet on Monday his proposal to
transfer full control of Palestinian towns near Jerusalem as a "
down payment" on the third redeployment.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders will discuss ways to overcome difficulties in
their negotiations, which, according to chief Palestinian
negotiator Yasser Abed Rabbo, have made "no progress whatsoever".
</P>
<P>
The talks will resume Sunday at a closed location in the
Jerusalem area.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli army and civilians in the north are frustrated by
the government's self-restraint from retaliating Hezbollah's rocket
attacks.
</P>
<P>
There have been arguments that the escalation of conflicts would
have only served Hezbollah and Syria. Nevertheless, a clear threat
to Syrian interests is the only way Israel can retain an "effective
deterrent" against attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Defence Force would have hit Syrian military camps
in Lebanon and the economic projects from which Syrian workers make
a living a long time ago, had it not feared a second front in an
all-out war with Syria.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Minister to Visit Syria to Strengthen Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Turkish State Minister Recep Onal,
leading a delegation of 100 businessmen, is due to be in Damascus
on Sunday to strengthen relations between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The visit is part of Ankara's diplomatic drive aimed at
improving cold or disputed relations with neighboring countries,
reported the Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Syria have been up in arms against one another for 15
years due to the issue of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party
leader Abdullah Ocalan, and at one point in 1998 they drew back
from the brink of war.
</P>
<P>
With the resolution of the thorny Ocalan issue, both the two
countries have expressed interest in improving the lukewarm ties.
In March this year, Turkish Deputy Foreign Ministry Undersecretary
Ugur Ziyal visited Damascus.
</P>
<P>
During his five-day visit, Onal will attend Turkey-Syria Joint
Economic Commission meetings, which will be held after an interval
of 12 years.
</P>
<P>
Agreements on reciprocal encouragement, protection of
investments and cooperation in customs are expected to be signed.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will take up the issue of prevention of double
taxation in the second round of negotiations, according to Turkish
officials.
</P>
<P>
Onal is expected to be received by Prime Minister Mohammed
Mustafa Miro and to have meetings with a number of Syrian
ministers.
</P>
<P>
Turkish officials said that oil is the most important item in
the trade between Syria and Turkey and trade volume either
decreased or increased as a result of the change of the oil deal. A
Turkish Export Product Fair, which will be opened in Damascus in
the middle of May, will provide an opportunity to diversify the
bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, Turkey sold goods worth 232 million U.S. dollars to
Syria and imported 307 million dollars of goods from it.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Condemns Calls to Invade White Farms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi has
warned some politicians against calls that local people invade
property owned by foreign companies or people of foreign origin,
saying that it was a recipe to chaos.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Member of Parliament Stephen Ndicho mobilized landless
Kenyans to invade farms owned by white farmers last month.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Nation newspaper quoted Moi as saying that such
behavior was " cheap politics" because the politician did this out
of party interests.
</P>
<P>
"Ndicho is telling people to invade farms owned by white farms.
The MP's call is meant to incite Africans to attack one another,"
Moi told a gathering on Saturday in central Kenyan town of
Naivasha, where many white farmers have invested in horticulture.
</P>
<P>
The president said reckless talk by some politicians was
undermining the government efforts to woo tourists and other
investors.

<P>
LUSAKA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government is to import
modern and sophisticated firearms for police services to help
combat the escalating crime wave in the country, Inspector General
of Police Sailus Ngangula has disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Times of Zambia newspaper quoted Ngangula as saying
discussions were underway to order versatile guns which were not
only sophisticated, but portable and suitable for police duties.
</P>
<P>

Kabwe in Central Province on Saturday that his men were on the
war-path and would not spare bandits who were robbing and killing
innocent people in cold blood.
</P>
<P>
He said his command had taken time to advise people from
engaging in criminal activities, but the situation still remained
bad.
</P>
<P>
Although ever more and more community police posts are
springing up all over residential, business or industrial and
other areas, the crime situation has steadily got out of hand with
aggravated robbery ranking uppermost.
</P>
<P>
According to police statistics, up to 126,631 crimes were
reported in 1999 and 121,613 in 1998, of which 30,736 and 30,804
convictions were recorded respectively.
</P>
<P>
Of these cases, only 47,474 and 50,693 were investigated and
cleared respectively in 1999 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
Ngangula said police officers had been killed and his command
has instructed officers to be tough and employ measures to keep
away criminals in case of attack.
</P>
<P>
He described fighting crime as a war, saying that officers
could only fight crime if morale was high and promotions would be
enhanced while logistics would be improved.

<HEADLINE> China Fights Against Water Shortage (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Each morning at dawn, about
thirty residents in Moshanzi Village in north China's Hebei
Province gather around a small water tower to fetch water.
</P>
<P>
Because of a drought, water is a scarce commodity. According to
statistics, many areas, including Moshanzi Village have been
drought-stricken.
</P>
<P>
China's water per capita are about 2,400 cubic meters, making
up 25 percent of the world's average. The United Nations has
listed China among the 13 nations in the world with water
shortages.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 70 percent of water is used for irrigation in
China, but only 40 percent of the irrigation water is efficiently
used due to backward technology. Around 27 million ha of fields
are hit by drought each year. Even when rain is abundant, 30
billion ha of fields lack water.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has adopted water-saving methods on
plains in the northern parts of the country. In the past few years,
25 billion yuan (about three billion US dollars) has been used in
building water-saving irrigation systems in 18 million ha of
fields in 300 counties.

<P>
SHANGHAI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- For most of her life, He Ziping, a
69-year old woman, had lived in a dilapidated house in Pudong in
east Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
"Before Pudong was developed, nine people of my family lived
together in a crowded room only 24 square meters large," the
elderly woman recalled. "When it rained, water would leak into our
room through the roof."
</P>
<P>
"Now we have moved into a spacious 100-square-meter house. Gas
has replaced coal for cooking," she said. "There is also a
bathroom in the suite, while in the past we had to share public
washrooms with others."
</P>
<P>
After He settled down in her new surroundings, she went back to
take a look at her previous residence in Pudong's Lujiazui
District, but all she could see was Jinmao Tower, China's highest
skyscraper. "Pudong is changing so fast," she said.
</P>
<P>
Lujiazui has the largest number of foreign financial
institutions in the country. Many foreign employees have settled
down in the Pudong New Area, replete with community service
facilities.
</P>
<P>
China started developing Pudong on April 18, 1990 in a drive to
reinvigorate Shanghai as an international trade and financial
center.

<P>
Over 3,000 families have moved into Pudong and in the past
decade, more than 30,000 households moved out of Lujiazui and 260,
000 farmers left their land and took up new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Linkun was already 60 when he moved. He started to study
gardening techniques and after two years he became a professional
gardener. "In fast-changing Pudong, I have to keep up with the
times, too," he said.
</P>
<P>
Many other farmers have learnt about computer, finance,
machinery, and catering.
</P>
<P>
In Jinqiao Zone in Pudong, villagers have set up warehouses for
Siemens and other large enterprises to store products, earning
more than 10 million yuan (about 1.2 million U.S. dollars) in
profits.
</P>
<P>
Farmers and others in Pudong have become more aware of life
styles in the West. "It is not unusual to see Shanghai men go to
work wearing western-style suits and ties," said Mr. Wang, a local
taxi-driver.
</P>
<P>
Once considered a "countryside" in the eyes of Shanghainese,
Pudong has become one of the most attractive choice for college
students and returned Chinese students studying abroad.

Water is also scarce in cities. About 300 of all 570 cities in
China face water shortage. In the past 50 years, industrialization
and urbanization has seen China's GDP increase tenfold. This has
also seen a substantial increase in water consumption.
</P>
<P>
Wang Shucheng, minister of Water Resources, said at a recent
seminar in Beijing that saving water resources is a priority to
ensure that China's sustainable economic growth will continue.
</P>
<P>
The government will also improve the management of water
sources and employ sophisticated technology to improve water usage,
while issuing new laws and regulations for the safeguarding water
resources.
</P>
<P>
Today around two billion cubic meters of water is saved in
cities and 60 percent of industry-used water are recycled, up 15
percent from the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
However, specialists said that severe water shortages will
still remain a serious problem for China's sustainable economic
development. China's population might reach 1.6 billion by 2030.
By then, water resource per capita is expected to further decrease
by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The northern part of the country has more abundant water. The
government is considering building large projects to transport
water from the Yangtze River to help the regions north of the
Yellow River.

<P>
The population of the ethnic groups living in these areas is 5.
5 million. They have suffered from a severe shortage of drinking
water, which has affected not only local economic development but
also the people's health.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the water project, 3.5 million people and three
million animals in the areas now have enough water.

<HEADLINE> Barak, Arafat to Meet to Advance Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat are expected to meet on Sunday
or Monday to try to iron out key differences in negotiations for
the framework of a permanent status agreement.
</P>
<P>
Barak's office on Sunday would not rule out the possibility of
the meeting, but gave no details.
</P>
<P>
Other sources here said the two leaders will discuss during the
meeting ways to overcome the difficulties in their negotiations in
light of the expected delay in reaching the framework agreement.
</P>
<P>
The framework agreement was re-scheduled to be signed by the end
of May, and it now seems that this will be further postponed until
June or July.
</P>
<P>
Barak will also try to explain his proposal for the transfer of
three Palestinian villages near Jerusalem, including Abu Dis, to
the Palestinian National Authority as a "territorial down payment."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the current round of the intensive Israeli-
Palestinian final-status talks, which started April 30 at Israel's
southern resort city of Eilat, will resume on Sunday at a closed
location in the Jerusalem area.
</P>
<P>
Chief Palestinian negotiator Yasser Abed Rabbo has said that "no
progress whatsoever" had been made in the talks and that the gaps
were still wide.
</P>
<P>
In the talks, the Israeli side has proposed for an interim
Palestinian statehood in 66 percent of the West Bank and Gaza Strip
in exchange for postponing negotiations over final borders and the
Jerusalem issue beyond next September.
</P>
<P>
But this proposal has been rejected by the PNA.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian side refuses completely all Israeli attempts to
avoid international land for peace resolutions...The Israeli
suggestions will be rejected by the Palestinian leadership and will
not be considered for negotiations," the PNA said in a statement
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians fear that if such interim measures are adopted,
negotiations over the remaining issues may then drag on for years
in the absence of international pressure.
</P>
<P>
U.S. special Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross, who is here
mandating the final-status talks, held talks Friday night with
Arafat in the West Bank city of Ramallah after a Thursday meeting
with Barak.
</P>
<P>
Ross will fly back to Washington on Tuesday to report the talks
to U.S. President Bill Clinton and return to the region next week.
</P>
<P>
The final-status talks cover the thorniest issues such as the
fate of Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees, borders, Jewish
settlements and water.

<HEADLINE> hke050714--China Urges ADB to Reduce or Exempt Interest Payments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHIANG MAI, Thailand, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government
hopes that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will allocate some
resources for ordinary capital resources (OCR) interests payment
reduction or exemption so as to alleviate the burdens of the
borrowers, Chinese Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng said here
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 33rd Annual Meeting of the Board of Governors
of the ADB, Xiang said that China hopes that the bank will, in
accordance with its annual review of the net income, allocate some
resources for OCR interests payment reduction or exemption so as
to alleviate the burdens of the borrowers.
</P>
<P>
After hardening the lending terms of soft loans, the ADB has
recently increased the price of OCR, or hard loans, thus placing
more burdens on the borrowers and "seriously hampering the
effectiveness of the bank's strategy for poverty reduction." Xiang
said.
</P>
<P>
China hopes that the ADB will mobilize all possible resources
for more hard loans so as to help the developing members to
realize their objective of poverty reduction, he said.
</P>
<P>
Xiang also appeals to the developed countries to effectively
fulfill their commitment to assisting the poor countries in their
economic development by increasing their contributions to the
Asian Development Fund and concessional funds for technical
assistance for the developing countries in their economic endeavor
for complete elimination of poverty.
</P>
<P>
"From a long-term perspective and the mutual inter-dependence
of the world economy, the economic development of the developing
countries is not only in their own interests, but is also
beneficial to the developed countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed concerns at the ADB's income and resource
situation, saying it "leaves no room for optimism."
</P>
<P>
"To turn around this situation, it's necessary for the bank to
further improve its investment management, reduce cost and improve
the quality of project implementation while starting an overall
review of its resource situation at an early date," he said.
</P>
<P>
He thanked the ADB, the most important regional financial
institution for development, for its unremitting efforts to
promote economic development and cooperation for the members of
the Asian region for many years in the past.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the ADB will as always continue to foster
economic growth and cooperation in the region as its fundamental
purpose," said Xiang.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed the participants on China's macroeconomic
situation and the development strategy to speed up development of
its western region, adding that the Chinese government welcomes
the ADB's participation in and support for the development of the
western region of the country, and also welcomes foreign
investment and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, focusing on poverty reduction, opened on Saturday
in this mountainous city, some 1,000 kilometers north of Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 representatives from most of the bank's 58 members,
including finance ministers, central bank governors and officials
from international financial institutions, are attending the three-
day meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Board of Governors, the ADB's highest policy-making body,
comprises one representative from each member and meets annually.
</P>
<P>
The board elects the Board of Directors every two years.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the bank also holds seminars on issues
ranging from poverty reduction and the international financial
architecture to the global networked economy.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1966, the ADB is a multinational finance
institution.
</P>
<P>
With 42 of its members from the Asian and Pacific region, the
bank engages in a wide range of social and economic development
activities aimed at improving the welfare of the people in the
region.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the ADB rededicated itself to the fight against
poverty by adopting a new poverty reduction strategy that rests on
three pillars: pro-poor, sustainable economic growth, social
development and good governance.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Negotiator Asks Troops to Stay Away From Hostage-Takers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government chief
negotiator Nur Misuari Sunday called on the military again to stop
troops from drawing near the hostage-takers in Sulu, saying it
could endanger the lives of the foreign captives.
</P>
<P>
Misuari, governor of the Autonomous Region of the Muslim
Mindanao, made the call in Mindanao after his emissaries lost
contact with the Abu Sayyaf men holding 21 foreign hostages in the
mountains of Sulu province, according to the Philippine News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
"My emissaries are still searching for the abductors because
after soldiers clashed with them, they have moved somewhere (from
their former hideout)," Misuari said.
</P>
<P>
The military clashed with the Sayyaf gunmen in Sulu after they
cordoned off the hostage-takers' lair in the hinterlands of
Talipao town.
</P>
<P>
"I was told by my emissaries that the Abu Sayyaf split into
groups and we never really know their exact location at this time
but they must be within Talipao area," he said.
</P>
<P>
The hostages were taken by the Abu Sayyaf to Sulu from the
Malaysian island resort of Sipadan off Borneo two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Sulu-based Abu Sayyaf extremists threatened anew
to execute two of their hostages unless the military stop
harassing them and withdraw from the area.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Enact New Laws to Check Cyber Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The government of Bangladesh is
expected to enact new laws during the next session of parliament
to check cyber-crimes, the Financial Express reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a high-ranking official at the Science and
Technology Ministry as saying that the Bangladesh Computer Council
(BCC), the government's watchdog on compute-related issues, has
already been asked to examine cyber-laws in the developed
countries to make a draft law.
</P>
<P>
According to rough estimates, there are around 150,000 Internet
users in the country at present. But those directly related to
cyber-crimes are still quite few in numbers.
</P>
<P>
It was not until recently that cyber-crimes have become a hot
topic of discussion and have raised public alarm in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Although at present cyber-crime is mainly focused on hacking,
it may soon corrupt the entire process of e-commerce, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
Transactions like electronic fund transfer, credit and debit
card transactions may face serious jeopardy in the hands of such "
digitally corrupt" people, he said.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Pandora's Box on cyber-crime was opened only
recently when a wholesale hacking was detected in one of the
leading Internet service provider (ISP) firms -- Brac Bdmail.
</P>
<P>
"This exposed our vulnerability in the area of cyber-rights
protection and total lack of legal provisions for combating the
menace," said an insider of ISP.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, all the ISPs recently met the Adviser of the
National Committee on Software Exports Jamilur Reza Choudhury and
the topic was discussed.
</P>
<P>
The committee has already recommended the government work out
the modalities for putting timely cyber-laws in place.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Coastal People live in Tension During Cyclones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Ten million people in the coastal
areas of Bangladesh are living in tension during cyclones and
tidal surges, as only one taka (two U.S. cents) is being spent per
head for saving the lives and properties of the people from these
natural disasters, the official Bangladesh News Agency reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
About 11 million people have been living in 11 coastal
districts of the country, the report said.
</P>
<P>
There are 1,841 cyclone shelters in the coastal areas of the
districts for about 1.3 million of people only. For the safety of
the people, 3,000 cyclone shelters are needed in the areas.
</P>
<P>
There are 32,904 volunteers of the Red Crescent Society of
Bangladesh in the coastal areas and they are working in 2,742
units of the society.
</P>
<P>
Besides, at least 4,000 fishermen and 1,200 students have been
trained up for facing the calamities during the disasters. The Red
Crescent Society will depend on the volunteers as it has an
insufficient number of workers.
</P>
<P>
In the 1998-99 fiscal year, 11.7 million taka (234,000 U.S.
dollars) was approved by the government for the Red Crescent
society. It means that only one taka is being spent per head of
the coastal people who are facing natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
The coastal people need more cyclone shelters, modern equipment,
sirens for awareness and transport for easy transfer of the people
of the coastal belts, the report stressed.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- "Face-to-face" telephone
conversations will soon become commonplace in China as China
Telecom is to offer videophone and long-distance video-
conferencing services throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The program will be first introduced into the Shenzhen Special
Economic Zone, according to today's Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
While now the main obstacle to the development of videophone
services is the phone's high price for ordinary households, said
Zhou Jiajian, an official with Shenzhen Shenda Telephone Co. Ltd.,
at the ongoing China's First Videophone and Long-distance
Conferencing Equipment Exhibition in Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
A videophone will cost about 4,000 yuan (about 480 U.S. dollars)
to 6,000 yuan, which is much higher than a television or a washing
machine.
</P>
<P>
However, the price is expected to fall dramatically once the
videophone becomes the target of mass production. And with the
improvement of manufacturing technology, the retail price will be
likely to drop to some 2,200 yuan, said Huang Donglin, an expert
on videophone and long-distance videoconferencing programs.

<HEADLINE> Insurers Dabble in Hi-Tech Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- China's insurance companies have
begun to dabble in the hi-tech computer insurance field, while no
company has yet dared to handle complicated computer insurance
designed to hedge losses stemming from hacker damage and computer
viruses.
</P>
<P>
China has seen a surge in the number of its computer users in
recent years, and the overall assets of the computer industry in
China amounted to 300 billion yuan (about 36 billion U.S. dollars)
by April last year, according to the statistics from the country's
largest non-life insurer, the People's Insurance Company of China
(PICC).
</P>
<P>
PICC began to offer computer insurance products in 1995 on a
trial basis. Encouraged by past success, it decided recently to
offer the insurance nationwide through its outlets, said today's
Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
Policyholders can be compensated by PICC if damage occurs to
computer hardware or if they have to copy their data because of
disasters including fires, explosions, pipeline breakages,
thunderstorms, hurricanes, or robberies.
</P>
<P>
Computer users have shown great enthusiasm for new products
with booming sales in Shanghai and Zhejiang, Guangdong, Liaoning
provinces since its debut. "Profits of the new product are fairly
high and we expect it to become a new growth sector in PICC," said
a managing staff with PICC.
</P>
<P>
According to related market surveys, repair fees of computers
during the past two years have been about 2 percent to 5 percent
of a computer's purchase price. And some well-known computer
manufacturers even have to spend the equivalent of 10 percent to
16 percent of their turnover from sales every year to back their
products.
</P>
<P>
While, with the popularization of computers, computer risks
have increased as well in recent years. The security of
computerized data is threatened by attacks from viruses and
hackers, and PICC has listed them as liability-free clauses as
these are hard to control.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, established overseas insurers have been engaged in
the hacker and virus insurance business for years.

<HEADLINE> Interview: More Tourism Attractions Developed in HK (1)  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The green countryside and cultural
heritage of Hong Kong are becoming new tourist attractions for its
tens of thousands of travelers, who accept the city not just as a
world class metropolis known for shopping and dining experiences.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted by the Hong Kong Tourist Association (HKTA)
in 1999 found that some 20 percent of the visitors to Hong Kong
expressed interest in taking part in hiking and other outdoor
activities in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Tourists often have the wrong impression that Hong Kong is a
city without much country. Actually, more than 40 percent of Hong
Kong's land is protected in 23 country and marine parks that are
home to a wide variety of flora and fauna," said HKTA executive
director Amy Chan recently.
</P>
<P>
She told Xinhua that some species, such as the Romer's tree
frog, are found nowhere else in the world, while the blackfaced
spoonbill, one of the rarest birds, makes the Mai Po wetland a
halfway house on their winter migration.
</P>
<P>
"Green tourism may not be something the world immediately
associates with Hong Kong, but there is no reason why not," said
Chan. "Our hiking trails are not only gloriously beautiful, but
also uniquely accessible, most being within an hour's journey by
public transport from just about anywhere."
</P>
<P>
To develop this new travel vogue, the HKTA published a new
guidebook, Exploring Hong Kong's Countryside -- A Visitor's
Companion, in cooperation with the Agriculture, Fisheries and
Conservation Department of Hong Kong last year.
</P>
<P>
"It is a passport to our rich natural heritage which I hope
will encourage both tourists and locals alike to explore our
magnificent countryside -- and by doing so, learn to respect the
environment that we all have a duty to help protect," said Chan. (

<HEADLINE> Interview: More Tourist Attractions Developed in HK (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The HKTA's efforts to diversify tourist attractions have got
support from the government. Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), stressed the
sustainable development of tourism and its promotion as an
important part of the strategy.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement we reached with Walt Disney Company for the
development of Hong Kong Disneyland is one manifestation of this
goal. The international theme park, which is due to open in 2005,
will help to keep Hong Kong as a key destination on the global
tourism map," said Tung recently.
</P>
<P>
Besides the Disney theme park, the Hong Kong SAR government has
invited expression of interest in the construction and operation
of a scenic cable car system to link up the new airport with the
Giant Buddha on Lantau Island.
</P>
<P>
The feasibility study on a proposed Fisherman's Wharf
development in the traditional fishing village is near completion.
To capitalize on the growing interest of eco-tourism, Hong Kong
will soon begin building an International Wetland Park adjacent to
Mai Po Marshes in the New Territories which is already an
internationally recognized wildlife conservation site.
</P>
<P>
Heritage and culture, another important aspect of Hong Kong's
tourist attractions, have received priority in the government
blueprint for tourism development. The Heritage Tourism Task Force
(HTTF), chaired by the HKTA, has been established to promote Hong
Kong's distinctive heritage.
</P>
<P>
"The HKTA's strategy for promotion has in the past focused on
ensuring that our markets are aware of the existence and
accessibility of our many heritage sites," said Chan.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, 23 percent of all visitors to Hong Kong expressed
interest in this area, she said, noting that there have been very
significant increases in the level of interest in heritage
activities over the past few years, compared to the only 7.6
percent of all visitors interested in such activities in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Some of the traditional Chinese festivals, such as the Birthday
of Goddess of the Sea recently, are most popular events for
tourists nowadays. Dragon Boat racing that takes place in June
during the Tuen Ng Festival has become one of Hong Kong's most
exciting and most loved spectacles.
</P>
<P>
"Now the main objective is developing more local awareness and
appreciation of our significant past. Hong Kong has much of which
to be proud and much that is worth preserving for generations to
come," said Chan.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Seeks Data from Delhi for Flood Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has asked India to provide
available data on water level of rivers in the upper catchment
areas to facilitate early flood warning, The Daily Star reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We have already requested the Indian Water Resources Ministry
to supply us available figures on the state of rivers which flow
from the upper reaches to Bangladesh's deltaic region," Khalilur
Rahman, chairman of the Joint Rivers Commission, told the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
A total of 54 rivers flow from India into the Bay of Bengal
through Bangladesh. A treaty on sharing Ganges water was signed
between the two countries on December 12, 1996.
</P>
<P>
"If we get prior information about water level in the upper
catchment areas, we will be able to calculate the movement and
expected level of water in the downstream more accurately," said
the expert.
</P>
<P>
He said information on flow of water will enhance the flood
forecasting ability by increasing the lead time from present 48
hours to at least 72 hours.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the country suffered its worst floods in a century.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the pattern of water flow in rivers can be
predicted to a great extent if data and information are exchanged
between the two countries regularly.
</P>
<P>
But Bangladesh now has no access to data monitored by India on
other common rivers except the Ganges, said the experts.

<P>
NEW DELHI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- India's inflation rate reached a
70-week high of 6.10 percent for the week ended April 22 on
account of a sharp increase in electricity tariffs during the week,
an official release said here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The figure was the highest since December 19, 1998, when a 6.13
percent inflation rate was recorded, said the release.

During the week ended April 22, there was a 15 percent rise in
electricity tariffs across the country, which led to the sharp
increase in inflation, it noted.
</P>

The 6.10 percent rate was 0.55 percentage points up from the
previous week, while the inflation rate for the corresponding week
of last year was merely 3.86 percent, it added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Politicians Urge Congress to Pass PNTR With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"China will join the WTO, whether or not the United States
gives it PNTR status," the Montanan Democratic said at a luncheon
hosted by American Enterprise Institute here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Baucus said in a speech that the bilateral WTO agreement signed
last November provides enormous potential economic benefit to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
However, European and Japanese competitors will reap benefits
from China's trade liberalization, and U.S. workers, farmers and
manufacturers will lose lots of opportunities if the U.S. Congress
fails to pass the PNTR bill, said Baucus.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that PNTR should not be tied with non-trade
issues. "I never believe that unilateral sanctions will be
effective in changing the behavior of a nation in non-trade areas,
and the history has proved it," said the senator.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tennessee Governor Don Sundquist Saturday expressed
his support of permanent normal trade with China. He argued in the
Republicans' weekly address that Congress should agree to PNTR
with China to ensure that Americans gain business opportunities in
the world's biggest and most important emerging market.
</P>
<P>
Michigan Governor Engler, another Republican, said in an
interview with Xinhua that he definitely supports the PNTR with
China. In mid-April, Mr. Engler led a state delegation to visit
Shanghai, where General Motor Corporation has set up a joint-
venture factory.
</P>
<P>
Sundquist and Engler's views were reported to be popular among
state governors, 43 of whom signed a letter to House and Senate
leaders last week in support of the permanent normal trade with
China.
</P>
<P>
A House vote is expected in two weeks. If it passes, the Senate
likely would take it up next month.

<HEADLINE> Indiana Beats 76ers at Semifinal Series Operner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NEW YORK, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Indiana Pacers roared to a 108-
91 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers in the opener of their NBA
Eastern Conference semifinal series on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Reggie Miller and Jalen Rose scored 40 points apiece and both
hit the floor gunning as the Pacers raced to a 34-15 first-quarter
lead in their home court.
</P>
<P>
Miller scored 16 of his 40 points in the first quarter. He
made 11-of-18 shots, including seven 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
Rose contributed 11 of his career-high 40 in the opening
period. He was 16-of-23 from the field, including three 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
Together, Miller and Rose became the first pair of Pacers and
only the fourth playoff duo to score 40 points in the same game.
The last to do it were Houston's Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler
against Utah on May 5, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Coming off four days of rest following a first-round series
win over Charlotte, the 76ers trailed 9-0 after 3 1/2 minutes and
never led.
</P>
<P>
When Philadelphia surged within six points midway through the
third quarter, Miller and Rose rose up again. The duo combined for
26 straight Indiana points over a 15-minute span beginning in the
second period.
</P>
<P>
The Pacers led 78-69 entering the fourth quarter and never let
the Sixers get closer than eight points.
</P>
<P>
Iverson, who led the Sixers with 28 points, stalked referee
Ken Mauer, yelling in his face while accidentally bumping into him.
Iverson was ejected with 2:53 left.
</P>
<P>
Game 2 of the best-of-seven series will be played in
Indianapolis on Monday, but it is unclear whether Iverson will be
available or under a suspension.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia and Brunei have agreed to
develop, together with Malaysia, business and industrial centers
around the border areas of the three countries on Borneo island,
leading newspapers reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached here Saturday during a meeting
between Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid and visiting Brunei
Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, according to the newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Foreign Minister Alwi Shihab said after the meeting
that joint economic activities would be able to reduce social
tensions caused partly by the huge economic gap among the people
living in the area.
</P>
<P>
"Our people near the border, for instance, see Bruneians
driving Mercedes while they themselves only drive bullock carts.
So in eliminating the jealousy, investment must be boosted around
the borders," he said.
</P>
<P>
The sultan arrived in Jakarta on Friday evening for a two-day
working visit, as a courtesy following Wahid's stopover in Bandar
Sri Begawan, capital of Brunei, on February 27.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two leaders also discussed the latest
developments in Indonesia's troubled provinces of Aceh, Maluku and
North Maluku.
</P>
<P>
Wahid assured his guest that the Aceh problem would be solved
soon through the signing of a note of understanding between the
central government and the Free Aceh Movement (GAM) in Geneva next
week.
</P>
<P>
"The signing in Geneva will become a starting point toward
peace for Aceh people. And the sultan was happy to obtain the
explanation," said Alwi.
</P>
<P>
The sultan promised to step up investment in Indonesia. He also
offered scholarships for Indonesian students who want to study in
the oil industry in Brunei.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll Reaches 27 in Indonesia's Earthquake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from a powerful
earthquake that caused widespread damage in the eastern province
of Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, grew to 27 on Saturday, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Musdar Amin, secretary to the emergency post in Banggai regency,
the worst hit area, said Saturday in Makassar, South Sulawesi,
that more than 153 people were seriously injured. "Forty-three of
them are in critical condition," reports reaching here Sunday said.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said they expected the death toll to grow, as
the quake caused a small tsunami tidal wave that struck some of
the outlying islands.
</P>
<P>
An earthquake measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale jolted the
Banggai islands on Thursday. The epicenter of the quake was in the
Peleng strait, some 2,000 kilometers northeast of Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Local officials estimated that about 80 percent of the
buildings on Banggai islands were damaged.
</P>
<P>
The emergency post also recorded that more than 250 government
offices, 64 churches, 92 mosques, 182 schools, 15 health centers
and approximately 11,000 residential houses were damaged by the
quake.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a total of 148 roads and 15 bridges were destroyed,
Musdar said, adding that aftershocks upset the residents on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Meteorology and Geophysics Agency in Makassar have recorded
at least 200 aftershocks.

BOGOTA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A total of 110 hostages kidnapped by
a Colombian guerrilla group were released Saturday by a Colombian
military force in a surprise operation.
</P>
<P>
The National Liberation Army (ELN) kidnapped the 110 people on
a road of the southern department of El Cauca at 05:30 local time
Saturday after the guerrilla group set up a checkpoint near the
city of Timbio, detouring tourists-loaded buses toward a
mountainous zone, army communications chief Colonel Paulino
Coronado said.
</P>
<P>
Two guerrilla members were killed and two others were seized
during the raid carried out by the military force. All of the
abducted people were free unhurt, the colonel said.
</P>
<P>
The ELN guerrilla and the government have been arranging the
details for the start of the peace talks suspended more than one
year ago, when President Andres Pastrana refused to demilitarize a
region in the north of the country to turn it into the scenario
for the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Residents of three cities in the northern departments or

<HEADLINE> China Sets Population Goal for Next Decade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- China will control its population to
within 1.4 billion by the end of 2010, according to a decision on
population and family planning issued by the Chinese Communist
Party Central Committee and the State Council on March 2.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the goal, China will try to keep the average
population birth rate under 1.5 percent a year, according to the
decision. The populations in the Hong Kong and Macao special
administrative regions and in Taiwan Province are not included in
the project.
</P>
<P>
China will also work to improve the health of newborns, balance
the proportion of baby girls and boys in the total number of
newborns, and provide better reproductive health care services.
</P>
<P>
An improved family planning system will also be created
featuring more effective management, administrative measures, and
laws.
</P>
<P>
The decision cited several principles which will help realize
the population goal in the next decade. The population growth
should be coordinated with the economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
The country will continue to encourage marriage and
childbearing at later ages and call for "one child per couple,"
while some couples will be allowed to have a second child in
accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
People from ethnic minority groups should also follow the
family planning policy. But the specific regulations for them will
be issued by the governments of provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities.
</P>
<P>
Other principles include involving all of society in promoting
family planning and solving the population problem, combining
state rules with people's will, and improving people's life and
education through family planning services.

<HEADLINE> China to Improve Population Control System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- China will build a more complete
control system and create a better environment through state
policies to promote population and family planning work, according
to a decision issued by the Chinese Communist Party Central
Committee and the State Council on March 2.
</P>
<P>
The decision called on governments and departments at all
levels to consider the best interests of the planning work when
they set regulations and reform measures concerning land,
enterprises, health care, social security, household register,
labor, education and finance.
</P>
<P>
The country will speed up the legislative work on population
and family planning and improve the laws governing family planning,
the decision said.
</P>
<P>
Governments at all levels should help rural families which
follow the family planning policy to increase their income, solve
problems, and improve their social and economic status.
</P>
<P>
Rural areas should continue to practice the principle that the
area of a family's tilth will not be affected by the increase or
reduction of its population. And those families who violate
family planning regulations should be fined for the additional
children they bear.
</P>
<P>
One-child families in urban areas are to receive the one-child
bonus, and parents can apply for government subsidies after
retirement. Rural families which practice family planning,
especially those only having girls, will enjoy favorable treatment
in income distribution, public welfare and contracting of land.
</P>
<P>
China will reform the social security system so that it will
provide pensions for parents who practiced family planning,
according to the decision.
</P>
<P>
In urban areas, the pension insurance, basic health care
insurance, social welfare and other kinds of social security
systems will be available, while in rural areas, local governments
will form a pension system for one-child and two-daughter families.

BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- China will involve all corners of
society to promote the country's family planning work, according
to a decision issued by the Chinese Communist Party Central
Committee and the State Council On March 2.
</P>
<P>
The decision said that communities should introduce population
and family planning work into their management and service. In
rural areas, the work will be launched by village committees while
in urban areas, street and neighborhood committees should be
responsible for it.
</P>
<P>
Local governments of areas where transient populations live
should take the major share of responsibility for their family
planning, and provide the migrants with necessary services.
</P>
<P>
Departments of information, education, science and technology,
and culture should play active roles in spreading knowledge about
population and family planning and create a better social
environment for family planning, the decision said.
</P>
<P>
Family planning and health care departments will cooperate to
provide services for birth control and other reproductive health
care needs. And more safe, effective and proper contraceptive
methods should be available for women of childbearing age.
</P>
<P>
The development and promotion of new technology and new
products for contraception, birth control, prenatal and postnatal
care should be encouraged, according to the decision.
</P>
<P>
China will also expand international cooperation and exchanges
in population and family planning to study and introduce advanced
experience and methods in the field.

On May 8, 1999, the U.S. bombed the Chinese Embassy in the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which caused heavy casualties and
serious damages to the embassy building.
</P>
<P>
Such an act done by the U.S. "is a serious international
unlawful act, which gravely infringed on China's sovereignty,
greatly hurt the feeling of the Chinese people, and severely
undermined the Sino-U.S. relations," Sun pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Sun said that the Chinese government and people expressed their
strong condemnation and utmost indignation over the bombing and
such a solemn position and demand has won wide sympathy and
support from the international community.
</P>
<P>
"It must be pointed out that the mutual respect of sovereignty
and territorial integrity is the essential prerequisite for the
development of state-to-state relations," Sun stated.
</P>
<P>
He further noted that the Chinese side has consistently
advocated for handling state-to-state relations on the basis of
the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, the United Nations
Charter and basic norms governing international relations as
defined by international laws. "China firmly opposes any form of
hegemonism and power politics," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. side should have a clear understanding on the
seriousness of the bombing, conduct a comprehensive and thorough
investigation and give the Chinese government and people a
satisfactory explanation," the spokesman stressed.

<HEADLINE> China Publishes Decision on Population and Family Planning (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- China will realize a low birth rate
and shift from slow population growth to zero growth in the next
few decades, according to a decision by the Chinese Communist
Party Central Committee and the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Entitled "Decision on Strengthening Population and Family
Planning Work and Maintaining A Low Birth Rate," the document
issued on March 2 has set goals and principles for China's
population and family planning work for the next decades.
</P>
<P>
China will keep the average population birth rate under 1.5
percent a year to control its population to within 1.4 billion by
the end of 2010, according to the decision.
</P>
<P>
The populations in the Hong Kong and Macao special
administrative regions and in Taiwan Province are not included in
the project.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese population will reach its peak (nearly 1.6 billion)
by the middle of the 21st Century, and the population quality will
be improved during the period.
</P>
<P>
The 5,500-word document consists of five parts: "Keeping the
birth rate low is a crucial but hard task in the future"; "Goals
and principles for population and family planning work for the
next decade"; "Improving the controlling system for population and
family planning and relevant social and economic policies"; "
Building a management mechanism of population and family planning
which appeals to the socialist market economy"; and "Strengthening
the leadership of party and government in population and family
planning work".
</P>
<P>
The decision points out that population is a major issue in
today's China, and also a key factor affecting the country's
economic and social development.

<HEADLINE> China to Sustain Low Birth Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- China faces the crucial but
monumental task of sustaining a low birth rate in the early 21st
Century, according to a decision on population and family planning
issued by the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and the
State Council On March 2.
</P>
<P>
In the next few decades, China will shift from slow population
growth to zero growth if a low birth rate is maintained. The
population will reach its peak by the middle of the 21st Century,
and the population quality will be improved during the period.
</P>
<P>
However, the country continues to feel the pressure of a large
and growing population. The population will increase by 10 million
a year in the next few decades, and it won't be easy to improve
the population quality within a short period.
</P>
<P>
The aging of the population, the contradictions among
population, economy, society, resources and environment, and other
problems still remain.
</P>
<P>
The next 10 years is a vital period for China to sustain a low
birth rate, the decision said. If there are any mistakes in
population policy and family planning work, or negative effects
brought about by the international community, the birth rate in
China might return to a high level.
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the population problem is the issue of
development which is closely related to the improvement of people'
s life and population quality and the prosperity of the Chinese
nation.
</P>
<P>
The decision called on government and party officials at all
levels to attach great importance to the population issue, and
make every effort to realize the country's goal in population and
family planning.

<P>
To control the population growth and improve population quality
is of strategic importance to the realization of socialist
modernization and sustainable growth, according to the decision.
</P>
<P>
It notes that since the reform and opening-up policies were
initiated in 1978, China has succeeded in shifting from having a
high birth rate, low death rate and high population growth to the
current low birth rate, low death rate and low growth rate.
</P>
<P>
It points out that this transformation has helped to slow down
the population growth worldwide.
</P>
<P>
However, the decision said, the country will continue to feel
the pressure of a large and growing population, while the aging of
population, the contradictions among population, economy,
resources and environment, and other problems still exist.
</P>
<P>
A more perfect control system will be built and a better
environment will be created through legislation and state policies
to promote population and family planning work.
</P>
<P>
Departments of information, education, science and technology,
and culture should play active roles in spreading knowledge about
population and family planning, the decision said.
</P>
<P>
Family planning and health care departments should cooperate in
providing services for birth control and other health care needs.
And more safe, effective and proper contraceptive methods should
be made available to women of childbearing age.
</P>
<P>
The decision urged the party, government and society as a whole
to work harder to promote population and family planning work so
as to serve the long-term interests of the nation.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Peacekeeping Chief to Fly to Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The head of U.N. peacekeeping
operations is leaving for Sierra Leone Sunday to boost morale of U.
N. troops and join political talks underway on a large number of U.
N. soldiers taken hostage in the West African country.
</P>
<P>
Bernard Miyet, the U.N. under-secretary-general for
peacekeeping operations, is expected to arrive in Sierra Leonean
capital of Freetown Tuesday, the U.N. spokesman, Fred Eckhard,
said.
</P>
<P>
"He is to boost the morale of troops in the wake of the
devastating events of the last few days and to help the political
process underway to try to resolve the matter of the hostages
peacefully," Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
Miyet made the move while the U.N. Security Council is to
convene an emergent meeting Sunday to discuss the collapsed peace
talks between Ethiopia and Eritrea and be briefed on the latest
developments in Sierra Leone, where a large number of U.N.
peacekeepers were taken hostage by rebels, U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
The closed-door meeting was scheduled to begin at 3:30 p.m. EST.
Ethiopia and Eritrea, which have been engaged in a border conflict
for two years, blamed each other for the breakdown of talks Friday
in the Algerian capital of Algiers.
</P>
<P>
In Sierra Leone, rebels from the Revolutionary United Fronted
were battling U.N. peacekeepers in the interior of the West
African country while U.N. troops were reported mobilizing for
action in the nation's capital of Freetown. The rebels have taken
at least 300 U.N. peacekeepers hostage over the last week, with
another 200 missing.
</P>
<P>
The peacekeepers are mainly from Zambia, India,Kenya and
Nigeria and were dispatched to the West African country to monitor
a peace accord signed last July to end the nine-year civil war in
the country.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the troops taken hostage, U.N. officials
reported that of the four Kenyan soldiers missing and presumed
dead, two have turned up alive in the bush. But one Kenyan soldier
has been confirmed dead while the fourth is still missing.

<P>
LONDON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The British government on Sunday
decided to reduce its diplomatic support staff in Sierra Leone and
warned its nationals to leave the Western African country because
of the deteriorating security situation.
</P>
<P>
"We have decided that we will reduce our diplomatic staff in
Sierra Leone and we are advising British nationals with no
essential reasons for remaining to leave," said Foreign Minister
Robin Cook.
</P>
<P>
The move comes after the abduction of several hundred members
of the United Nations peacekeeping force.

<P>
Also on Sunday, the United States advised its citizens to leave,
saying the international airport in Freetown, the capital city of
Sierra Leone, was liable to close without warning.

Britain is also sending troops and warships to Sierra Leone as
a"precautionary measure" to help Britons trapped there.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Defense said the force being sent to that
region comprised a paratroop battalion, a frigate, a helicopter
carrier and three support vessels.
</P>
<P>
In Sierra Leone, fighting has resumed in breach of a 1999 peace
accord which Britain helped to broker.

<HEADLINE> Update: Britain sends Taskforce to Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Britain is on Sunday sending a
battalion of paratroops and five warships to West Africa to help
Britons who may need to be airlifted from violence in Sierra Leone
because of the deteriorating security situation.
</P>
<P>
About 700-800 soldiers including support staff, as well as a
helicopter carrier, a frigate and three support ships are to be
deployed, it was announced in London.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Ministry of Defense stressed that the
deployments were "precautionary measures to ensure that we are
best placed to respond quickly to safeguard the security of
British nationals, if that becomes necessary".
</P>
<P>
That deployment follows a similar decision by the United States
to provide helicopters to fly its nationals out of Sierra Leone,
where fighting has resumed in breach of a 1999 peace accord which
Britain helped to broker.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Office spokesman said the decision had been taken to
move key military assets to Senegal, a country near Sierra Leone,
"as a precautionary measure should an evacuation of British
nationals from Sierra Leone be required."
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Sunday, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Britain
was cutting the number of non-essential staff in its Sierra Leone
embassy and urging its nationals to leave.
</P>
<P>
"We have decided that we will reduce our diplomatic staff in
Sierra Leone and we are advising British nationals with no
essential reasons for remaining to leave," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
These actions came after the abduction of several hundred
members of the United Nations peacekeeping force in that Western
African country.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations accused rebel forces in Sierra Leone of
holding some 300 of its peacekeepers and civilian staff hostage.
</P>
<P>
Cook, speaking at a meeting of European Union foreign ministers
in Portugal's Azores Islands, said renewed fighting underlined the
need for U.N. peacekeeping forces to be brought up to full
strength as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has around 8,700 troops in Sierra Leone,due
to reach its full strength of 11,000 by July.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 7 (Xinhua) -- South African Foreign Minister
 Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma and Defence Minister Mosiuoa Lekota will
attend the Organization of African Unity (OAU) ministerial
conference on security, stability, development and cooperation in
Nigeria on Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The conference followed a decision in Algiers last year
proclaiming the year 2000 to be "The Year of Peace, Security and
Solidarity in Africa", Foreign Ministry spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the ministers in draft documents recognized that
security should be seen in its totality including the rights of
people to live in peace with an access to basic necessities and
enjoying rights enshrined in the Africa Charter on Human and
People's Rights.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also recognized that stability required that all
states be guided by adhering to the rule of law, good governance,
respect for human rights, established political parties and people
being allowed to participate in public affairs.
</P>
<P>
Mamoepa said ministers agreed that sustainable growth and
economic development should be guaranteed by inter-cooperation
among OAU member states.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Experts Remain Divided Over What Causes AIDS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 7 (Xinhua) -- International AIDS experts
remained deeply divided about the cause of the disease after a
weekend gathering in Pretoria, but they agreed on Sunday that a
simple experiment might resolve the matter.
</P>
<P>
They decided to set up a sub-group to explore what the nature
of such an experiment should be, President of the South African
National Research Foundation Khotso Mokhele told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"This will hopefully put to rest once and for all this
question," he said.
</P>
<P>
The more than 30 scientists enlisted by South Africa to test
assumptions about AIDS are evenly split between experts
questioning the link between HIV and AIDS and those subscribing to
the conventional view.
</P>
<P>
The major outcome of the meeting was an agreement that there
was a possible series of simple experiments that could be done to
deal with the cause of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Chief facilitator of the discussions on Saturday and Sunday,
Stephen Owen, said the two camps -- after heated debates --
remained deeply divided about the cause of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
"There remains the divergent points of view of the
relationship of HIV to AIDS. That point of difference remains in
very stark terms," he said.
</P>
<P>
The panel of scientists was initiated by President Thabo
Mbeki. Dubbed the Presidential AIDS Advisory Council, its aim was
to furnish him with practical recommendations on how the fight
against Aids should be tackled in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Members of the council will follow up their weekend
deliberations with a closed Internet discussion over the next four
to six weeks. They will then reconvene in South Africa to conclude
the debate and to finalize their proposals.
</P>
<P>
The exercise has come under fire from several local as well as
 international scientists subscribing to the view that HIV has
conclusively been proven as the cause of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Mokhele said the purpose of the weekend gathering was not to
narrow differences. The purpose was to identify issues for
discussion and debate.
</P>
<P>
"We succeeded in listing key questions around the cause, the
prevention and the treatment of AIDS," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It ought not be too costly and ought not to take a long time,"
Mokhele said.
</P>
<P>
Mokhele would not give details on the nature of these
experiments, saying that was to be formulated by the sub-group.

LAGOS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Britain is sending a battalion of

Sierra Leone because of the deteriorating security situation
there.

The British Broadcast Corporation (BBC) reported Sunday that
some 700 to 800 soldiers including support staff, as well as a

Earlier Britain and the United States warned their nationals to

</P>
<P>
The current crisis was caused by the abduction of about 500 UN
soldiers and other personals following last weeks attacks upon the

<HEADLINE> Security Council Sends Mission to Horn of Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Sunday decided to authorize its Mission to the Democratic Republic
of Congo to visit Ethiopia and Eritrea on Monday to urge the two
neighboring African countries to refrain from resorting to force
and further hostilities.
</P>
<P>
The decision was adopted at the end of an emergency meeting
here on Sunday afternoon after the indirect peace talks between
Ethiopia and Eritrea broke in Algiers, capital of Algeria, Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The Mission will travel to Addis Ababa and Asmara to meet
with the Government of Ethiopia and the Government of Eritrea,"
the Security Council said in a press handout.
</P>
<P>
"The Mission, acting on the basis of relevant Security Council
decisions, will express in the strongest possible terms the
Council's support for the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
peace process, for its current Chair Algeria, and for their
ongoing efforts to achieve a negotiated settlement to this
conflict," the Council said.
</P>
<P>
"This Mission will urge strongly both parties to refrain from
resorting to force and further hostilities, and to commit
immediately, seriously and without precondition to negotiations to
achieve final consolidated technical arrangements for
implementation of the OAU Framework Agreement and its Modalities
for Implementation," said the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The two countries went to war in May 1998 over their frontier,
which has not been demarcated since Eritrea gained independence
from Ethiopia in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Both Eritrea and Ethiopia have accepted a framework peace
agreement and a broad implementation strategy drafted by the OAU,
but differences existed between the two countries over the
technical arrangement for the implementation.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Considers A Field Mission to Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Sunday studied the possibility to send another field mission to
Sierra Leone in order to secure the quick settlement to the
hostage crisis in the West African country.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made by the president of the Security
Council, Wang Yingfan of China, at the end of an emergency meeting
of the 15-member body.
</P>
<P>
The Council began to convene an emergent meeting on Sunday
afternoon to discuss the collapsed peace talks between Ethiopia
and Eritrea and be briefed on the latest developments in Sierra
Leone, where a large number of U.N. peacekeepers were taken
hostage by rebels.
</P>
<P>
"We explored the possibility whether the Security Council
could send another field mission (to Sierra Leone), like (what) we
did in Kosovo, and now in the DRC (the Democratic Republic of
Congo)," he said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has sent Bernard Miyet, the
U.N. under-secretary-general for peacekeeping, to Sierra Leone,
Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the U.N. spokesman, Fred Eckhard, said that Miyet is
flying to Sierra Leone to boost the morale of U.N. troops and join
the political talks underway on the hundreds of U.N. peacekeepers
still held by rebels in the West African country.
</P>
<P>
"He is to boost the morale of troops in the wake of the
devastating events of the last few days and to help the political
process underway to try to resolve the matter of the hostages
peacefully," Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
In Sierra Leone, rebels from the Revolutionary United Fronted
were battling U.N. peacekeepers in the interior of the West
African country while U.N. troops were reported mobilizing for
action in the nation's capital of Freetown. The rebels have taken
at least 300 U.N. peacekeepers hostage over the last week, with
another 200 missing.
</P>
<P>
The peacekeepers are mainly from Zambia, India,Kenya and
Nigeria and were dispatched to the West African country to monitor
a peace accord signed last July to end the nine-year civil war in
the country.
