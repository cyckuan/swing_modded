 &HT;    (Bill Maxwell, African American, is an editorial writer and
columnist for the St. Petersburg Times in St. Petersburg, Fla. He

 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    St. Petersburg, Fla., is still sometimes known as the city where
old people come to die _ in droves.
 &HT;    If you recite this adage to 79-year-old William Dixon
Southworth, he will give you a lecture that goes something like
this: ``I don't mind my age at all. The thought of being a teenager
again _ being young again _ is something that not only is
impossible but it's unattractive. I like my age. I have a good
marriage. In fact, I still have what Ronald Reagan calls the
`privileges of marriage.' I still enjoy those. I'm healthy. All of
my vital organs are good. I'm enjoying life and loving God. I get
along with people, and I get along with myself.''
 &HT;    Southworth, a career educator who earned a doctorate from New
York University in school administration and supervision and who
retired to St. Petersburg in 1984, believes that old age is the
time to do life's most important work.
 &HT;    Everything he did before retirement _ serving seven years in the
U.S. Navy, teaching fourth through eighth grades in public school
and serving 14 years as a principal, a professor and a department
chairman at St. Johns University in New York _ contributed to his
zest for life in his golden years.
 &HT;    Upon retiring from St. Johns University and after having spent
decades writing academic gobbledygook, Southworth bought a computer
and decided to make his lifelong dream of publishing fiction come
true. When he and his wife, Violet, settled into their St.
Petersburg condominium near the Gulf of Mexico, he honed his skills
by writing full-page columns for the Condominium Times of Altamonte
Springs. The columns focused on parliamentary procedure and
conflict resolution.
 &HT;    After several years, Southworth realized that he had accumulated
enough columns for a book. Professor Martha Haun of the University
of Houston read the columns, liked them and helped Southworth edit
them, whereupon McGraw Hill published 75 of them as a book.
 &HT;    But as the urge to write fiction pulled stronger than ever,
Southworth wrote a semi-autobiographic tale, the ``Sensual
Sailor,'' about his naval experiences. He rewrote it four times on
a typewriter. Because his dissertation had been highly regarded, he
thought that his first novel had bestseller potential.
 &HT;    ``Literary agent Scott Meredith thought otherwise,'' Southworth
said, smiling at his naivete of long ago. ``Meredith said that my
book had ``all the flaws of a first novel. I do not recommend
revising it. You preachify, are too wordy, and seem to think there
is uniqueness in what has happened to you. What you think is
interesting is not interesting.' ''
 &HT;    Southworth was frustrated but not crushed, fully believing that
the agent was the misguided one. He sent the manuscript to another
agent, this time a woman. ``Her review was shorter, and tarter,''
he said. ``Although short on criticism, she was equally as short on
advice. ``Read, read, read,' she said. I thought I had been
reading, starting at age 6.''
 &HT;    Southworth does not recall where the idea came from, but he
decided that the best way to get published was to drop the
autobiographical angle and invent stories about the Navy. ``I took
a sea story (a big lie) from the first book and made it into a
mystery, `Murder on the Flagship,''' he said. ``It was a better
book than the first, but 20 publishers, according to the literary
agent I retained, said, kindly, `not at this time.'
 &HT;    ``I wanted to write, and I knew I must write about what I knew,
my naval experiences. Then my third book, ``Q, the Story of Captain
Quimby Scott, U.S. Navy,'' was published in 1997. The pain of years
of disappointment was alleviated by the actuality of my words in
print.''
 &HT;    Since then, Southworth has not looked back and has two more
manuscripts in search of a publisher.
 &HT;    ``I have made peace with the elements of writing, knowing that I
must write'' he said. ``So far, there has been scant monetary
return for my efforts. It came as a surprise to me that my greatest
satisfaction has been the acceptance, the little bit of praise for
my efforts. The author wants and needs to be read, despite the
nonsense that the author writes only for himself. If that were
true, why would he write down his thoughts at all, or, having
written them down, why show them to anyone else?''
 &HT;    The Southworths get out of bed each morning at 7:30. While
Violet prepares a light breakfast and tends her magnificent
collection of African violets, her husband heads straight to the
computer and writes for four to five hours. After writing, he takes
a 30-minute afternoon nap. Then he swims in the condominium's pool,
does chores and rounds out the day with reading.
 &HT;    His life, he said, is an example of useful retirement, of
defying the notion that St. Petersburg is the elderly's funeral
parlor. ``Retirement has been a swapping of working for someone
else, to working for myself,'' he said. ``Retirement frees people
to do things they never could before. In retirement, you select the
work as opposed to before when you had to do somebody else's
bidding to make a salary, to survive.
 &HT;    ``The pension check has replaced the paycheck. Boredom in
retirement, short of physical disability, is a product of too great
a concentration on personal convenience _ the elimination of
challenge. Cliche though it may be, to wear out is better than to
rust out.''
 &HT;    And the future?
 &HT;    ``I propose to live to 100 and keep on writing,'' he said. ``I
see no reason why not. I have energy and a joy for living. I am
endowed with certain characteristics, certain talents. It is my
obligation to continue to develop them, and, by developing them, I
develop myself as a person. I also have an obligation to nurture
this society that first nurtured me so that I can contribute.''
 &HT;    His contribution to society?
 &HT;    ``Writing,'' he said. ``Showing other retirees the joys of old
age. I'm looking for a new idea for a book right now.''

 By TIM GIAGO (Nanwica Kciji) 
 &HT;    (Tim Giago, Lakota Indian, is publisher and editor-in-chief of
Indian Country Today. His Indian name is Nanwica Kciji.) 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By now we are all familiar with the Republican debacle and the
psychological triumph by the Democrats in the recent election. What
about the elections in Indian country?
 &HT;    Selection of leaders by a democratic vote in the Indian nations
of America has a profound impact on the lives of the residents of
those Indian lands.
 &HT;    The recent loss of the leader of the Mescalaro Apache people in
New Mexico, Wendell Chino _ a man elected to serve his people for
more than 40 years _ makes it quite evident how hard such leaders
are to replace. Chino died unexpectedly Nov. 4 of heart failure at
the age of 74.
 &HT;    On the largest Indian reservation in America, the Navajo Nation,
where political chaos has been the rule, Kelsey Begay, former
speaker of the house, was elected in a landslide vote. Over the
past 10 years the Navajo people have seen one of their greatest
leaders, Peter MacDonald incarcerated, their last duly elected
leader, Albert Hale, resign, and have witnessed tremendous
instability in tribal leadership. The Navajo people hope this is
now all behind them and that Begay will get their tribe back on
track.
 &HT;    The problems on the San Carlos Apache Reservation in Arizona
finally came to a violent head this past summer. Although the
voters of that nation elected Raymond Stanley to serve as their
chairman, dissident residents blocked his efforts to take office.
The latest election proved once and for all that the people have
spoken and once again they have chosen Stanley as their leader.
Most residents of this troubled reservation hope the minority
dissenters will accept the vote of the people and allow Stanley to
get on with governing the people.
 &HT;    One of the disturbing elements in the conflict was that Stanley
supporters invited outsiders (members of the American Indian
Movement) onto their lands to assist them in regaining the
chairman's rightful position. Any reservation rocked by internal
squabbles has discovered, much to its dismay, that when outsiders
are invited to their land to help solve internal problems, the
problems only intensify.
 &HT;    On the second largest reservation in the land, the Pine Ridge
Reservation in South Dakota, former chairman Harold Dean Salway won
over incumbent John Yellow Bird Steele. Former chairman Wilbur
Between Lodge was chosen as vice chairman of the tribe after a very
tightly contested race with tribal secretary Theresa `Huck' Two
Bulls. It would appear that Two Bulls has a very bright future in
tribal politics. It was the first time she ran for such a high
office and her strong showing stunned many tribal residents. The
Oglala Lakota people have never elected a woman as tribal
president.
 &HT;    In the great Northwest an ominous storm blew through the land.
Washington state joined California in passing legislation stopping
affirmative action. Indian tribes in Washington are pondering the
wording of the initiative which would prohibit preferential
treatment based on race or gender in state or federal government
hiring, in awarding state contracts and in admission to public
colleges and universities.
 &HT;    Passing this legislation in Washington state comes at a most
inappropriate time for minority journalists planning to hold a
Unity '99 convention in Seattle. Members of the National
Association of Black Journalists voiced concerns prior to the
election and now, with the passage of I-200, many are considering
boycotting the state of Washington.
 &HT;    Passage of this initiative could have a devastating impact upon
the ability of the 21 Indian tribes in Washington state to get
state and federal jobs and to receive preferential treatment in
seeking higher education opportunities.
 &HT;    In California minority enrollment in major colleges and
universities has dwindled considerably. Many tribal members see
this initiative as a backlash against successful operation of their
gaming casinos.
 &HT;    Tribal leaders fear the retaliation could jeopardize their
compacts and agreements with the state government to operate legal
casinos. They feel the state could retaliate by claiming gaming
compacts are based upon race.
 &HT;    When Arizona fought against proclaiming a Martin Luther King
holiday, African American, Hispanic and American Indian
organizations boycotted that state. In fact, a meeting of American
Indian lawyers was moved to another state in protest.
 &HT;    I would advise the members of the National Association of Black
Journalists, National Association of Hispanic Journalists, National
Association of Asian-American Journalists and the members of the
Native American Journalists Association to look into their hearts
before holding their Unity '99 convention in Seattle. Consider the
serious damage I-200 will do to all minorities in the state as well
as to the Indian nations.
 &HT;    I always try to practice what I preach. Although I am the
founder of the Native American Journalists Association and my
editor, Avis Little Eagle, serves on its board, I will not attend
the Unity '99 convention in Seattle. I believe I owe it to all of
the racial minorities in the state of Washington who will be
damaged by the initiative that would deny them affirmative action.

 By TIM GIAGO (Nanwica Kciji) 
 &HT;    (Tim Giago, Lakota Indian, is publisher and editor-in-chief of
Indian Country Today. His Indian name is Nanwica Kciji.) 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By now we are all familiar with the Republican debacle and the
psychological triumph by the Democrats in the recent election. What
about the elections in Indian country?
 &HT;    Selection of leaders by a democratic vote in the Indian nations
of America has a profound impact on the lives of the residents of
those Indian lands.
 &HT;    The recent loss of the leader of the Mescalaro Apache people in
New Mexico, Wendell Chino _ a man elected to serve his people for
more than 40 years _ makes it quite evident how hard such leaders
are to replace. Chino died unexpectedly Nov. 4 of heart failure at
the age of 74.
 &HT;    On the largest Indian reservation in America, the Navajo Nation,
where political chaos has been the rule, Kelsey Begay, former
speaker of the house, was elected in a landslide vote. Over the
past 10 years the Navajo people have seen one of their greatest
leaders, Peter MacDonald incarcerated, their last duly elected
leader, Albert Hale, resign, and have witnessed tremendous
instability in tribal leadership. The Navajo people hope this is
now all behind them and that Begay will get their tribe back on
track.
 &HT;    The problems on the San Carlos Apache Reservation in Arizona
finally came to a violent head this past summer. Although the
voters of that nation elected Raymond Stanley to serve as their
chairman, dissident residents blocked his efforts to take office.
The latest election proved once and for all that the people have
spoken and once again they have chosen Stanley as their leader.
Most residents of this troubled reservation hope the minority
dissenters will accept the vote of the people and allow Stanley to
get on with governing the people.
 &HT;    One of the disturbing elements in the conflict was that Stanley
supporters invited outsiders (members of the American Indian
Movement) onto their lands to assist them in regaining the
chairman's rightful position. Any reservation rocked by internal
squabbles has discovered, much to its dismay, that when outsiders
are invited to their land to help solve internal problems, the
problems only intensify.
 &HT;    On the second largest reservation in the land, the Pine Ridge
Reservation in South Dakota, former chairman Harold Dean Salway won
over incumbent John Yellow Bird Steele. Former chairman Wilbur
Between Lodge was chosen as vice chairman of the tribe after a very
tightly contested race with tribal secretary Theresa `Huck' Two
Bulls. It would appear that Two Bulls has a very bright future in
tribal politics. It was the first time she ran for such a high
office and her strong showing stunned many tribal residents. The
Oglala Lakota people have never elected a woman as tribal
president.
 &HT;    In the great Northwest an ominous storm blew through the land.
Washington state joined California in passing legislation stopping
affirmative action. Indian tribes in Washington are pondering the
wording of the initiative which would prohibit preferential
treatment based on race or gender in state or federal government
hiring, in awarding state contracts and in admission to public
colleges and universities.
 &HT;    Passing this legislation in Washington state comes at a most
inappropriate time for minority journalists planning to hold a
Unity '99 convention in Seattle. Members of the National
Association of Black Journalists voiced concerns prior to the
election and now, with the passage of I-200, many are considering
boycotting the state of Washington.
 &HT;    Passage of this initiative could have a devastating impact upon
the ability of the 21 Indian tribes in Washington state to get

 &HT;    Tribal leaders fear the retaliation could jeopardize their
compacts and agreements with the state government to operate legal
casinos. They feel the state could retaliate by claiming gaming
compacts are based upon race.
 &HT;    When Arizona fought against proclaiming a Martin Luther King

 &HT;    I would advise the members of the National Association of Black

Native American Journalists Association to look into their hearts
before holding their Unity '99 convention in Seattle. Consider the
serious damage I-200 will do to all minorities in the state as well
as to the Indian nations.

 &HT;    (Raoul Lowery Contreras, Mexican American, is a columnist and

radio talk show on KOGO-AM.) 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    One of the most striking TV commericals in history was shown
only once, during a Super Bowl, years ago and its impact went far
beyond television. It showed people marching to the tune of a big
brother, moving as ordered, until one of the people takes a hammer
and chain and smashes the giant television screen from which came
the orders. The target: IBM; the challenger, Apple Computer.
 &HT;    The ad was important because it demonstrated a profound respect
for the underdog among many Americans, while it demonstrated that
many other Americans are like sheep and follow each other like the
proverbial lemmings over the cliff.
 &HT;    Example: There is the great disrespect that many, if not most
Americans have for the Constitution, in particular, the Bill of
Rights, specifically, the First Amendment.
 &HT;    All of this leads to a search for why most Americans don't
believe in the Bill of Rights, the first 10 amendments to the
Constitution, amendments that were passed by the first Congress as
part of the deal to ratify the Constitution.
 &HT;    For instance, many surveys over the years conclude that most
people don't believe in Freedom of Speech or Expression, as
protected by the First Amendment in these words: ``Congress shall
make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.''
The 14th Amendment extended that protection to individuals in the
several states, to protect them from the states.
 &HT;    Not everyone gets the word, of course. The Congress passed a law
making it criminal to ``advocate the violent overthrow of the
government.'' It is speech to ``advocate,'' yet they made such
speech criminal and the American people fervently applauded that.
The Supreme Court, however, junked that law because it did outlaw
speech. It's criminal to try to physically overthrow the
government, but not to talk about it.
 &HT;    One, of course, does not have free speech in court. One swears
to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. If a
person does not tell the truth, or makes a false statement, he or
she can go to jail.
 &HT;    Free speech has also stood in the way of limiting campaign
contributions for the simple reason, the courts have ruled, that
one is denied his full exercise of free speech if he can't raise
and spend whatever he can in a campaign.
 &HT;    Libel and slander laws protect non-public people from scurrilous
attempts to demonize or criminalize them, but ordinary folk don't
have the same rights to sue according to the famous Sullivan vs.
New York Times decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in 1964.
 &HT;    This brings us back to the Constitution and what it means. It
exists to protect individuals from government of the majority. It
is designed to protect the one single person from the government.
It restrains Congress from making laws that curtail our freedom of
speech and expression. It states that explicitly. It means that
explicitly.
 &HT;    So why do so many Americans disregard the 1st Amendment? Why do
so many run around complaining about those who do exercise free
speech. Why do Congressmen, of all people, try to pass laws
restricting someone else's speech?
 &HT;    Why did California do such a thing as pass a law making English
the official language of California? It even allows an individual
to sue the State if he or wishes to enforce English as the official
language of California. Funny, English is not officially the
language of the United States and there is no mention of that in
the Constitution. Yet, a majority of White and Black citizens in
California voted to force an official language on all Californians.
They must have forgotten the words in the Constitution about not
abridging free speech. I haven't.
 &HT;    I may not be the one who smashes the Big Brother government,
like they did in the Apple TV commercial. But I will speak up for
the Constitution and against those who would treat us like
lemmings. And, I will do so in two languages, English and Spanish,
the California Constitution notwithstanding. If anyone has a
problem with that, sue me.
 &HT;    My defense is easy, it's the First Amendment to the Constitution
of the United States that says, ``Congress shall make no law ...
abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.'' Comprende?

 By AKILAH MONIFA 
 &HT;    (Akilah Monifa, African American, is a freelance writer and
journalist living in Oakland, Calif. She is a contributor to the
forthcoming book ``Seductions of Justice: Lesbian Legal Theories
and Practices.'' (1999) Routledge Press.)
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    To the very end, Margaret Walker Alexander believed her book
``Jubilee'' was the main source of material for Alex Haley's
acclaimed work ``Roots.''
 &HT;    Although she sued Haley for copyright infringement, the courts
dismissed her lawsuit. She died Nov. 30, at the age of 83,
unrequited.
 &HT;    Walker was born in Birmingham, Alabama and she and her family
went to live in New Orleans when she was 10. She moved to Chicago
in 1932 to complete her undergraduate education. While in Chicago
she became a member of the South Side Writers' Group initiated by
Richard Wright. Walker was later to address Richard Wright as the
`Daemonic Genius.'
 &HT;    She first came to literary attention with the publication of her
poem, ``For My People'' in 1942. It marked the first poetry
publication by an African American woman in 24 years.
 &HT;    Walker married Firnist Alexander in 1943 and gave birth to and
raised three children. In 1949, she and her family moved to
Mississippi.
 &HT;    From 1955 to 1962 Walker published nothing, and some of her more
cynical `friends' suggested she wasn't even a has-been, but only a
might-have-been. But Walker carried on. In Mississippi she had a
full time teaching position at Jackson State University where she
established the Institute for the Study of Black Life and Culture,
the first in the south. With the exception of four years _ three of
the Writers' Project and a one year sabbatical from teaching _
Walker wrote and was published while working full time and raising
a family. She published eight more books after completing
``Jubilee.''
 &HT;    But it was ``Jubilee,'' published in 1966, that put Walker on
the literary map. A historical fiction novel, it was loosely based
on her own `roots.'
 &HT;    ``Jubilee'' told the story of the daughter of a slave and a
white plantation owner. The New York Times Book Review said it
``chronicled the triumph of a free spirit over many kinds of
bondage.'' Walker acknowledged that it was based on the lives of
her grandmother and great-grandmother.
 &HT;    She alleged, albeit unsuccessfully that Haley had copied
voluminously from her book, and sued him for plagiarism _ with
disheartening results. Her law suit was dismissed. Haley only
conceded he admired Walker but claimed he had never read her book.
Despite what the courts ruled, Walker was convinced that ``Roots''
would not have been Roots if not for ``Jubilee.''
 &HT;    She was overshadowed in life and death not only by Haley but by
the more renowned Mississippian, William Faulkner. She critiqued
Faulkner especially about race.
 &HT;    Maryemma Graham, the editor of Walker's ``How I Wrote `Jubilee'
and Other Essays on Life and Literature'' noted that despite ``the
abundance of talent emerging from the South, no black writer has
ever achieved recognition by remaining there. Richard Wright is
identified with Chicago, New York, and Paris, and certainly not
with Mississippi or Tennessee. Ernest Gaines writes about Louisiana
exclusively, but it is California that claims him. The story is the
same with modern and contemporary black writers from Ralph Ellison
to Toni Morrison. Thus, in addition to being victimized by the
critical neglect that has affected black writing historically until
very recently, Walker seems to have suffered because of her
conscious decision to live as a black woman artist in the
20th-century South.''
 &HT;    I met Walker in the late 1970s at the State University of New
York at Binghamton. She was lecturing and was one of the first
literary personalities I had met. I was barely 20 years old and in
total awe.
 &HT;    Walker was a literary giant but also very real and approachable.
After her lecture she greeted everyone with a hug. She reminded me
of a grandmother to dream of.
 &HT;    Perhaps her death will spark new interest in her writings.

 &HT;    To the very end, Margaret Walker Alexander believed her book
``Jubilee'' was the main source of material for Alex Haley's
acclaimed work ``Roots.''
 &HT;    Although she sued Haley for copyright infringement, the courts
dismissed her lawsuit. She died Nov. 30, at the age of 83,
unrequited.
 &HT;    Walker was born in Birmingham, Alabama and she and her family
went to live in New Orleans when she was 10. She moved to Chicago
in 1932 to complete her undergraduate education. While in Chicago
she became a member of the South Side Writers' Group initiated by
Richard Wright. Walker was later to address Richard Wright as the
`Daemonic Genius.'
 &HT;    She first came to literary attention with the publication of her
poem, ``For My People'' in 1942. It marked the first poetry
publication by an African American woman in 24 years.
 &HT;    Walker married Firnist Alexander in 1943 and gave birth to and
raised three children. In 1949, she and her family moved to
Mississippi.
 &HT;    From 1955 to 1962 Walker published nothing, and some of her more
cynical `friends' suggested she wasn't even a has-been, but only a
might-have-been. But Walker carried on. In Mississippi she had a
full time teaching position at Jackson State University where she
established the Institute for the Study of Black Life and Culture,
the first in the south. With the exception of four years _ three of
the Writers' Project and a one year sabbatical from teaching _
Walker wrote and was published while working full time and raising
a family. She published eight more books after completing
``Jubilee.''
 &HT;    But it was ``Jubilee,'' published in 1966, that put Walker on
the literary map. A historical fiction novel, it was loosely based
on her own `roots.'
 &HT;    ``Jubilee'' told the story of the daughter of a slave and a
white plantation owner. The New York Times Book Review said it
``chronicled the triumph of a free spirit over many kinds of
bondage.'' Walker acknowledged that it was based on the lives of
her grandmother and great-grandmother.
 &HT;    She alleged, albeit unsuccessfully that Haley had copied
voluminously from her book, and sued him for plagiarism _ with
disheartening results. Her law suit was dismissed. Haley only
conceded he admired Walker but claimed he had never read her book.
Despite what the courts ruled, Walker was convinced that ``Roots''
would not have been Roots if not for ``Jubilee.''
 &HT;    She was overshadowed in life and death not only by Haley but by
the more renowned Mississippian, William Faulkner. She critiqued
Faulkner especially about race.
 &HT;    Maryemma Graham, the editor of Walker's ``How I Wrote `Jubilee'
and Other Essays on Life and Literature'' noted that despite ``the
abundance of talent emerging from the South, no black writer has
ever achieved recognition by remaining there. Richard Wright is
identified with Chicago, New York, and Paris, and certainly not
with Mississippi or Tennessee. Ernest Gaines writes about Louisiana
exclusively, but it is California that claims him. The story is the
same with modern and contemporary black writers from Ralph Ellison
to Toni Morrison. Thus, in addition to being victimized by the
critical neglect that has affected black writing historically until
very recently, Walker seems to have suffered because of her
conscious decision to live as a black woman artist in the
20th-century South.''
 &HT;    I met Walker in the late 1970s at the State University of New
York at Binghamton. She was lecturing and was one of the first
literary personalities I had met. I was barely 20 years old and in
total awe.
 &HT;    Walker was a literary giant but also very real and approachable.
After her lecture she greeted everyone with a hug. She reminded me
of a grandmother to dream of.
 &HT;    Perhaps her death will spark new interest in her writings.

 c. 1998 Hispanic Business

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Business is booming for homebuilder Ivar Pietri in his native
Puerto Rico, and the prospect of the island becoming the 51st state
of the union lends an even rosier glow to the Caribbean landscape.
 &HT;    ``Statehood would have a dramatic positive impact. Absolutely,''
says Pietri. ``Among the most important things when it comes to
economic development is certainty. And by its very nature, our
present political status is a transitory one. Statehood would give
the island certainty and full integration into the most prosperous
economy in the world.''
 &HT;    In the past five years, Puerto Rico's economy has been growing
slowly and construction has experienced a boom thanks in part to a
number of government initiatives. The number of people employed in
the island's construction industry has risen from 55,000 in 1992 to
71,000 in 1997, and the total value of construction projects
doubled in the same time period _ from $2.5 billion in 1992 to $5
billion in 1997, according to figures from the Puerto Rico Planning
Board.
 &HT;    Pietri, president of Peregrine Development Co. and a former
investment banker with the New York-based Lehman Brothers, is not
alone in his belief that statehood would only enhance the island's
growth.
 &HT;    In March, the U.S. House of Representatives voted 209-208 to set
Puerto Rican self-determination in motion. The 10-year process
would begin with the Dec. 13 referendum that offers Puerto Ricans
the choice of four options: statehood; independence; independence
with a vaguely defined ``free association'' with the United States;
or continuing their unusual commonwealth status. However, that bill
is currently held up in the Senate.
 &HT;    The Dec. 13 referendum is non-binding: Puerto Ricans' decision
on the future status of the island must receive the approval of the
U.S. Congress.
 &HT;    Supporters of statehood say the time is ripe because of several
factors, among them, the support of prostatehood Gov. Pedro
Rossello, who is calling for an end to the island's existence as
``a disenfranchised ghetto.''
 &HT;    Puerto Rico, located in the northern Caribbean about 1,000 miles
southeast of Miami, is about the same size as Connecticut (3,492
square miles). It has a population of 3.7 million, approximately
equal to that of Kentucky. Nearly half a million residents live in
its capital, San Juan. The climate is temperate, with an average of
75 degrees in the winter and 81 in the fall.
 &HT;    The main industry is manufacturing (41.5 percent of Puerto
Rico's gross domestic product), followed by service (38.2 percent)
and government (10.4 percent).
 &HT;    The island also has a strong and thriving entrepreneurial class
of local business owners, says Pietri. In addition, most of the
multinational corporations hire Puerto Rican managers to head up
their operations on the island.
 &HT;    If the island's residents choose statehood, then the issue will
come before the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate,
where two bills are currently pending.
 &HT;    Under the commonwealth agreement worked out in 1952, Puerto
Rico's residents are U.S. citizens and eligible for limited federal
aid, but they cannot vote for president unless they live on the
mainland and their sole representative in Congress, Carlos Romero
Barcelo, has no vote.
 &HT;    Jaime Morgan-Stubbe, executive director of the Puerto Rico
Industrial Development Co., says doubters should look to the past
if they want to see how statehood would affect Puerto Rico's
business climate. Morgan-Stubbe's job includes stimulating
investment and creating jobs in Puerto Rico, tasks that he says
will become easier if the island becomes a state.
 &HT;    ``Historically, none of the states were worse off after they
became states and gained economic integration into the union,'' he
says. ``Based on history alone, what we expect is a more profitable
economic environment _ without affecting the ability of Puerto Rico
to compete for investment and jobs.'' Gov. Pedro Rosello's push for
statehood pits local patriotism againt the convenience and
prosperity offered by the United States. It also confronts
Americans with the prospect of a U.S. state _ the 26th largest in
the nation _ where the predominant language is Spanish and the
people consider themselves a distinct nation.
 &HT;    Business owners have a lot at stake. Puerto Rico has long been a
haven for corporations seeking the benefits of the island's
tax-exempt status, and many Fortune 500 entities such as General
Electric, Intel Corp., Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., HewlettPackard Co.
and Sara Lee Corp. are long-established in Puerto Rico.
 &HT;    Changes have already been implemented. In 1996, Congress ended
Section 936, the income tax exemption for U.S. companies operating
in Puerto Rico. Section 936 offered those companies an income-based
tax credit and a wage-based tax credit. About 550 companies
operated under Section 936, employing more than 110,000 workers and
saving an estimated $3 billion annually, according to the Institute
for Puerto Rican Policy in New York.
 &HT;    Those tax credit benefits will be phased out over a 10-year
period, and some predict many corporations will abandon ship,
draining bank deposits and contributing further to the island's 14
percent unemployment rate.
 &HT;    Morgan-Stubbe says that hasn't happened, nor does he expect it
to. The government this year launched a series of economic
incentives to foster investment and development in Puerto Rico. The
1998 tax package includes a flat corporate income tax of between 2
percent and 7 percent, a 200 percent deduction for research and
development and job training, a special deduction for investment in
buildings, machinery, and equipment, and a 90 percent exemption on
property taxes. The package, Morgan-Stubbe says, makes Puerto Rico
even better than Singapore for manufacturing companies.
 &HT;    Jose Villamil, president of Estudio Tecnicos in San Juan, Puerto
Rico, says that the issue is not whether Puerto Rico becomes a
state; it is how the island navigates the transition to a new and
different status.
 &HT;    ``Puerto Rico is dealing with many things that have impacted its
economic development. But I don't think the statehood discussion
has had any impact at this time,'' he says.
 &HT;    Puerto Rico voters have faced the question of statehood before
(in 1967 and 1993) and turned it down. Villamil, however, predicts
that statehood will win this time and ticks off the reasons.
 &HT;    ``One, the opposition is disorganized with basically no
leadership. Second, the pro-statehood government has a huge amount
of resources and they're well organized. Third, the governor is a
pretty popular guy,'' Villamil says.
 &HT;    He adds, ``Becoming a state would probably take anywhere from 10
to 15 years and we would have to map out what those years would
look like.'' Villamil says that the key to Puerto Rico's economic
prosperity lies not with which path its voters choose, but with the
process of change.
 &HT;    ``Basically, the (possible) political statuses are equally
viable in the long run. But what we need to do very much is
negotiate the transition from what we have now to whatever the
alternative status would be. Negotiating the transition is the real
challenge,'' he says.
 &HT;    Those who favor statehood disagree, saying that statehood would
bring a wealth of economic opportunities to the island.
 &HT;    ``The fact alone of Puerto Rico becoming a state will attract a
lot of interest from the mainland,'' says Morgan-Stubbe.
``Statehood would do away with misunderstandings about the
(island's) actual political standing ... and would foster a more
stable climate in the minds of most business people.''
 &HT;    Currently, the island of Puerto Rico is a commonwealth, a local
self-governing territory under the U.S. Constitution. Its
government contains executive, legislative, and judicial branches.
General elections are held every four years; its residents have
been statutory U.S. citizens since 1917.
 &HT;    Commonwealth supporters say that the current arrangement is ``Lo
Mejor de Dos Mundos'' (The Best of Both Worlds). However, Puerto
Ricans have no voting representation in Congress and can't vote for
president. They receive lower levels of federal benefits, such as
welfare and Medicaid, but pay no federal income taxes. And their
future U.S. citizenship and nationality is not guaranteed.
 &HT;    Analysts say that the issue of federal income tax is key to the
upcoming referendum and approval by U.S. leaders of Puerto Rico's
statehood. David Lewis, deputy executive director of Caribbean
Latin-American Action, says an issue for American political leaders
is how Puerto Rico would fit with the other 50 states. Largely
Spanish-speaking, it has a per capita income of $8,000 annually.
That's half of the nation's poorest state, Mississippi, and a
fourth of the average U.S. per capita income.
 &HT;    In addition, Puerto Rico as a state would have two senators and
seven representatives in Washington, D.C.
 &HT;    ``That's more representation than many states have now. It would
also be eligible for more U.S. aid,'' Lewis said. ``For some,
that's a reason to have statehood; for others, it's a reason to
oppose it.''
 &HT;    Pietri believes that statehood would ``unleash tremendous
productive forces in Puerto Rico.''
 &HT;    ``We have tremendous competitive advantages in Puerto Rico. We
have a bilingual environment, a bicultural environment, a large and
trainable work force, a long affiliation with the United States ...
you take those conditions and you put them together with the
political power, the certainty and the full integration into the
U.S. economy.''

Electric, Intel Corp., Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., HewlettPackard Co.
and Sara Lee Corp. are long-established in Puerto Rico.
 &HT;    Changes have already been implemented. In 1996, Congress ended
Section 936, the income tax exemption for U.S. companies operating
in Puerto Rico. Section 936 offered those companies an income-based
tax credit and a wage-based tax credit. About 550 companies
operated under Section 936, employing more than 110,000 workers and
saving an estimated $3 billion annually, according to the Institute
for Puerto Rican Policy in New York.
 &HT;    Those tax credit benefits will be phased out over a 10-year
period, and some predict many corporations will abandon ship,
draining bank deposits and contributing further to the island's 14
percent unemployment rate.
 &HT;    Morgan-Stubbe says that hasn't happened, nor does he expect it
to. The government this year launched a series of economic
incentives to foster investment and development in Puerto Rico. The
1998 tax package includes a flat corporate income tax of between 2
percent and 7 percent, a 200 percent deduction for research and
development and job training, a special deduction for investment in
buildings, machinery, and equipment, and a 90 percent exemption on
property taxes. The package, Morgan-Stubbe says, makes Puerto Rico
even better than Singapore for manufacturing companies.
 &HT;    Jose Villamil, president of Estudio Tecnicos in San Juan, Puerto
Rico, says that the issue is not whether Puerto Rico becomes a
state; it is how the island navigates the transition to a new and
different status.
 &HT;    ``Puerto Rico is dealing with many things that have impacted its
economic development. But I don't think the statehood discussion
has had any impact at this time,'' he says.
 &HT;    Puerto Rico voters have faced the question of statehood before
(in 1967 and 1993) and turned it down. Villamil, however, predicts
that statehood will win this time and ticks off the reasons.
 &HT;    ``One, the opposition is disorganized with basically no
leadership. Second, the pro-statehood government has a huge amount
of resources and they're well organized. Third, the governor is a
pretty popular guy,'' Villamil says.
 &HT;    He adds, ``Becoming a state would probably take anywhere from 10
to 15 years and we would have to map out what those years would
look like.'' Villamil says that the key to Puerto Rico's economic
prosperity lies not with which path its voters choose, but with the
process of change.
 &HT;    ``Basically, the (possible) political statuses are equally
viable in the long run. But what we need to do very much is
negotiate the transition from what we have now to whatever the
alternative status would be. Negotiating the transition is the real
challenge,'' he says.
 &HT;    Those who favor statehood disagree, saying that statehood would
bring a wealth of economic opportunities to the island.
 &HT;    ``The fact alone of Puerto Rico becoming a state will attract a
lot of interest from the mainland,'' says Morgan-Stubbe.
``Statehood would do away with misunderstandings about the
(island's) actual political standing ... and would foster a more
stable climate in the minds of most business people.''
 &HT;    Currently, the island of Puerto Rico is a commonwealth, a local
self-governing territory under the U.S. Constitution. Its
government contains executive, legislative, and judicial branches.
General elections are held every four years; its residents have
been statutory U.S. citizens since 1917.
 &HT;    Commonwealth supporters say that the current arrangement is ``Lo
Mejor de Dos Mundos'' (The Best of Both Worlds). However, Puerto
Ricans have no voting representation in Congress and can't vote for
president. They receive lower levels of federal benefits, such as
welfare and Medicaid, but pay no federal income taxes. And their
future U.S. citizenship and nationality is not guaranteed.
 &HT;    Analysts say that the issue of federal income tax is key to the
upcoming referendum and approval by U.S. leaders of Puerto Rico's
statehood. David Lewis, deputy executive director of Caribbean
Latin-American Action, says an issue for American political leaders
is how Puerto Rico would fit with the other 50 states. Largely
Spanish-speaking, it has a per capita income of $8,000 annually.
That's half of the nation's poorest state, Mississippi, and a
fourth of the average U.S. per capita income.
 &HT;    In addition, Puerto Rico as a state would have two senators and
seven representatives in Washington, D.C.
 &HT;    ``That's more representation than many states have now. It would
also be eligible for more U.S. aid,'' Lewis said. ``For some,
that's a reason to have statehood; for others, it's a reason to
oppose it.''
 &HT;    Pietri believes that statehood would ``unleash tremendous
productive forces in Puerto Rico.''
 &HT;    ``We have tremendous competitive advantages in Puerto Rico. We
have a bilingual environment, a bicultural environment, a large and
trainable work force, a long affiliation with the United States ...
you take those conditions and you put them together with the
political power, the certainty and the full integration into the
U.S. economy.''

   RETIRED, BUT NOT FROM WORK. St. Petersburg, Fla., notes
columnist Bill Maxwell, is still sometimes known as the city where
old people go to die _ in droves. But 79-year-old William Dixon
Southworth disputes this notion. ``I don't mind my age at all,'' he
told Maxwell. ``The thought of being a teenager again _ being young
again _ is something that not only is impossible but it's
unattractive. I like my age. I have a good marriage. I'm healthy.
All of my vital organs are good. I'm enjoying life and loving God.
I get along with people, and I get along with myself.'' And, though
retired, he has not stopped working. Maxwell tells the remarkable
story of how he published his first novel.

While everyone knows the results of recent national elections,

``Selection of leaders by a democratic vote in the Indian nations
of America will have a profound impact,'' he says, ``and new
leadership in the Apache, Navajo, and Lakota nations, for examble,
will hopefully change the course of recent difficult times.'' But
Indians in the Northwest, he adds, worry how Washington state's new
legislation to stop affirmative action will affect them in higher

   PUERTO RICO AND THE ECONOMICS OF STATEHOOD. On Dec. 13, Puerto
Ricans will decide the future of their island. It will be the third
time they will vote on the issue of statehood since 1967.
``Statehood would have a dramatic, positive impact,'' builder Ivar
Pietri told Vivienne Heines of HISPANIC BUSINESS magazine. ``Among
the most important things when it comes to economic development is
certainty. And by its very nature, our present political status is
a transitory one. Statehood would give the island certainty and
full integration into the most prosperous economy in the world.''

   HOLLYWOOD _ No studio is hotter than Paramount, right now, and
the company that brought the ``Star Trek'' and ``Godfather'' series
to movie screens can thank an unsinkable boat and a bunch of
toddlers for its success.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount passed the $1 billion mark in domestic box office last
week, becoming only the third studio in Hollywood history to
achieve the milestone in one calendar year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Titanic'' delivered close to half of that total _ $443.2
million, to be exact _ while other key contributors were ``Deep
Impact,'' ``The Truman Show,'' ``The Rugrats Movie'' and ``Snake
Eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney and Sony are the only other studios to crack the
billion-dollar barrier, according to box office tracker Exhibitor
Relations Co. And Paramount films likely will add an additional
$100million to $150million during the year's last four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Its ``Rugrats'' has been a surprise hit and ``Star Trek:
Insurrection,'' which opens today in 2,620 theaters, should perform
solidly if the studio's eight other ``Star Trek'' films are any
guide.
</P>
<P>
   If Paramount's final total for the year hits $1.15 billion, it
will represent an impressive gain of 51 percent over 1997's $761
million total, which included $157.5 million from the first 13 days
of ``Titanic.'' What's particularly notable is that Paramount has
only released 11 movies so far this year, with five of those _
including ``Twilight,'' ``Hard Rain'' and ``The Odd Couple II'' _
grossing under $20 million each.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been amazing how well Paramount has done,'' said Paul
Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations Co., which
estimates the studio has achieved a 16.21 percent market share.
</P>
<P>
   This year will be the first in which two studios top the $1
billion mark. Disney crossed the $986 million mark Monday and could
take in as much as $150 million more by the end of the year if ``A
Bug's Life,'' ``Enemy of the State,'' ``The Waterboy'' and two
entries due out Dec. 25 _ ``Mighty Joe Young'' and ``A Civil
Action'' _ perform at the high end of expectations.
</P>
<P>
   So despite currently trailing Paramount by nearly $50 million,
Disney conceivably still could finish in first place for the fourth
time in five years. Either way, this year has solidified Disney's
status as Hollywood's most reliable performer. It topped $1 billion
in 1994, 1995 and 1996 before falling to $880 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   But Paramount is the surprise story as Hollywood's hottest
studio. In fact, Paramount easily would have broken Sony's record
$1.26 billion, set last year, if it had kept domestic rights to
``Saving Private Ryan,'' which grossed $190 million in the United
States and more than $200 million overseas.
</P>
<P>
   But, as with many of its high-profile projects, Paramount split
the financing. For ``Saving Private Ryan,'' a deal was struck with
DreamWorks SKG, giving Steven Spielberg's studio the domestic
distribution while Paramount retained foreign rights.
</P>
<P>
   In the best-known example of co-financing, Paramount invested
$65 million in ``Titanic'' in exchange for an estimated 40 percent
of the profits. 20th Century Fox picked up the rest of the $200
million cost and handled distribution overseas, where grosses
topped $1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount, under ownership by Viacom Inc. since 1994, has become
the most aggressive of Hollywood's seven major studios in pursuing
the sharing production costs. During 1998, it handled domestic
distribution on two co-produced projects _ ``Deep Impact'' with
DreamWorks and ``Snake Eyes'' with Disney _ and it split costs with
Disney on ``A Civil Action'' and will handle overseas distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Dergarabedian said such co-financing deals are becoming
increasingly popular as a way to deal effectively with soaring
production and marketing expenses. ``As costs rise, studios will
look to risk-sharing so the impact of a picture that doesn't
perform is not so devastating,'' he added. ``It's proven to be a
good business decision because these are such enormous
undertakings.''
</P>
<P>
   The Motion Picture Association of America estimated last year
that the average cost to make and market a movie had reached $75.6
million, up 30 percent from 1996. ``You're going to see more and
more co-financing,'' Dergarabedian promised.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street likes the practice, according to Prudential
Securities analyst Kathy Styponias. ``Co-financing does limit the
upside, but as (an) analyst I like to see it because the movie
business is so unpredictable,'' she said. ``It worked out pretty
well on `Titanic' and I think we'll see more of it. It's a function
of costs escalating, so I don't see what choice the studios have.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Cesinger, an analyst with investment bank Grief &AMP; Co.,
noted that co-financing prevents the major studios from creating a
glut.
</P>
<P>
   ``The studios are tired of driving prices into the
stratosphere,'' Cesinger said. ``With co-financing, you increase
the quality of your slate and decrease the competitive frenzy.''

BOTH SIDES MAKE USE OF CLINTON VIDEOTAPE IN SUMMATIONS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Both sides in the impeachment inquiry put President
Clinton on the witness stand on Thursday, showing snippets of video
from his deposition in the Paula Jones lawsuit to present him
alternately as: a) unfairly ganged up on by a bunch of lawyers, and
b) quite a talented liar.
</P>
<P>
   In summing up their case, the Republicans wanted to use the
tape, which had not been seen before, to embarrass the president.
In the end, Democrats pre-empted them by showing it first. They
used the tape to suggest that Clinton could not reasonably have
been expected to grasp a legal definition of sex when a roomful of
smart lawyers and an Arkansas judge could not agree on it, either.
</P>
<P>
   The part of the tape selected by the Democratic counsel, Abbe
Lowell, shows Clinton watching his lawyer, Robert Bennett, dispute
the broad definition of sex offered by Mrs. Jones' attorneys for
the purpose of deposing the president in connection with Mrs.
Jones' sexual harassment suit.
</P>
<P>
   Under one proposed definition, Bennett said, ``If the president
patted me and said I need to lose 10 pounds off my bottom, you
could argue that I had sexual relations with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal District Judge Susan Webber Wright said that she herself
found the definition a bit too complicated and agreed to narrow it
somewhat. ``It's going to make it difficult for me to rule, if you
want to know the truth, and I'm not sure Mr. Clinton knows all
these definitions anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the same bit of tape, Clinton seemed to undercut the
point the White House counsel was trying to make in showing it.
When one of Ms. Jones' lawyers asked him _ twice _ whether he
understood the meaning of the words, he pored over the definition
and nodded in assent, then said, ``I do.'' Clinton has repeatedly
said that whatever he did with Ms. Lewinsky, it did not amount to
sex.
</P>
<P>
   After the lights in the hearing room went back up, White House
counsel told the House Judiciary Committee that the tape showed the
president ``being set up by the Paula Jones attorneys and Linda
Tripp,'' and that his reactions were those of a cornered man
instinctively trying to protect himself from a sucker punch.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton gave the deposition on Jan. 17, he knew that Monica
Lewinsky had been subpoenaed by Ms. Jones' lawyers. But he was
clearly surprised by the detail of the questions by lawyers, who
knew even that he had given her a hat pin.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout much of the afternoon, Republican counsel David
Schippers used the same video to quite different ends,
interspersing his closing argument with video bits intended to
catch Clinton in what he characterized as outright lies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like you to look up at the screens to see his lies for
yourself,'' Schippers said. ``Watch!''
</P>
<P>
   In the first cut, Clinton answered a question about whether he
was ever alone in his office with Ms. Lewinsky. ``I don't recall,''
he said, ``but it seems to me she brought things to me once or
twice on the weekends,'' staying in the office only long enough to
drop off some papers and exchange pleasantries. ``When Congress is
there we're working all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Were he and Ms. Lewinsky at any time alone in the hallway off
the Oval Office? ``I don't believe so, unless we were walking back
with the pizza,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Alone in any room in the White House? Again, with annoyance, he
repeated that Ms. Lewinsky may have, in working overtime in the
legislative affairs office, dropped by to deliver some documents.
</P>
<P>
   Schippers seemed to take particular pleasure in showing a video
clip of Clinton saying he did not necessarily remember exchanging
gifts with Ms. Lewinsky. The Jan. 17 deposition took place less
than three weeks after he had given Ms. Lewinsky a number of
Christmas and going away gifts, including ``a bear, symbolizing
strength.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't recall,'' he said, smirking. ``Do you know what they
were?''
</P>
<P>
   And when asked if he remembered her giving him any gifts _ she
gave him at least 40, Schippers said, in a ritual they went through
at virtually every meeting _ Clinton scratched his head and said,
``Once or twice I think she's given me a book or two.''
</P>
<P>
   At another moment in the deposition, Clinton is shown watching
his lawyer, Bennett, make the case that he was well aware of Ms.
Lewinsky's affidavit claiming that she had no sexual relationship
with the president.
</P>
<P>
   The president has said that he allowed Bennett to make this
comment without knowing that it was less than completely truthful
because he had not been paying much attention to his lawyer. ``The
whole argument just passed me by,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schippers ballyhooed this piece of the tape, saying, ``Take a
look at this tape and you will see what the president of the United
States doesn't want the people ever to see.''
</P>
<P>
   And as promised, Clinton is shown riveted to his lawyer,
appearing very much absorbed in the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   As Bennett read Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit, the president nodded
in agreement with several points, and then affirmed, ``That's
absolutely true.''
</P>
<P>
   Did you have an extramarital affair with Monica Lewinsky, he was
asked. ``No, he said.''
</P>
<P>
   And if she said otherwise, the lawyer asked, would that be a
lie?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hesitated. Then he said, ``It's certainly not the
truth.''

ANGELS HIT ROADBLOCK IN PITCHING SEARCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ As baseball's winter meetings begin today in
Nashville, the Angels' search for a No.1 starter has hit a road
block. Randy Johnson is signed in Arizona and the possibility of
landing Kevin Brown or Roger Clemens is becoming more and more
remote.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, a free agent seeking a six-year deal worth about $80
million, spoke with the Angels and Dodgers this week, but he is
believed to be favoring the St. Louis Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, who has asked the Blue Jays to trade him, is likely
headed to the Indians or Rockies, though Blue Jays general manager
Gord Ash won't specify what team is the favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an offer from a club that from a player point of view
satisfies our needs,'' Ash said. ``What I've suggested to that club
is that they get guidance from Roger's representatives on how they
should proceed from there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, Astros and Rangers had been the top contenders for
Clemens, but Ash implied that the ``mystery club'' wasn't one of
them and would need Clemens' approval to trade for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess what I'm directing that club to do is make sure they
qualify,'' Ash said. ``They had a lot of questions for me that I
couldn't answer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have a surplus of outfielders that can be used to
acquire a starting pitcher in a trade, but it seems unlikely that
any team would be willing to give up a No.1 starter.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the Angels trying to trade for a No.3-type starter,
or signing an available free agent. Among the free agents available
are Tim Belcher, Doug Drabek, Jimmy Key, Steve Avery, Ricky Bones,
Orel Hershiser and even Jim Abbott.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' policy is to not discuss the players they are
targeting, although it is certain they have made contingency plans
in the event they do not land Brown or Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   With the recent addition of Mo Vaughn, the Angels lineup looks
good. But the starting pitching is a concern because their top two
starters are Chuck Finley, who is 36, and Ken Hill, who is coming
off elbow surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Knuckleballer Steve Sparks is coming off a surprisingly
productive season, but Allen Watson is not expected to be offered
arbitration and would be let go. Jarrod Washburn and Jason Dickson,
provided they are not traded, are expected to compete for starting
spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``These last two weeks are why I never want to become a general
manager,'' said Angels manager Terry Collins. ``(Angels general
manager) Billy (Bavasi) has put some time in. We're going to try to
get better, but it's not easy. There are not a lot of options right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley, an Angel since 1986, says the signing of Vaughn leaves
the Angels with no option other than getting pitching help, however
they have to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to put someone like Mo Vaughn out there, you'd
better make sure his RBIs hold up for you,'' Finley said. ``You
don't try to fill holes by putting Double-A and Triple-A guys out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean Finley would endorse a trade of one of the
outfielders?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only nine spots out there to play,'' he said. ``It's
getting a little crowded out there.'' &QL;

COCA-COLA SUMMONS ANALYSTS TO MEETING
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Coca-Cola Co. summoned securities analysts on
Thursday night for an early morning meeting in New York on Friday
with its chairman and chief executive, M. Douglas Ivester.
</P>
<P>
   The topic of the meeting was not disclosed, but analysts said it
was described to them as a ``major strategic announcement.''
</P>
<P>
   There was speculation on Thursday night that the meeting at the
company's midtown Manhattan office concerned a big financial
adjustment or a major acquisition, possibly of a soft-drink or
other beverage brand. Coca-Cola's chief financial officer, James
Chestnut, was also scheduled to brief analysts at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Coca-Cola, which has its headquarters in Atlanta,
did not return telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   It is routine for big publicly held companies to brief
securities analysts on developments that could affect their
financial outlooks and stock prices. But it is highly unusual for a
company to arrange these briefings on such short notice.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola has been particularly hurt by the economic travails in
developing countries over the past 18 months. On Thursday,
Coca-Cola's shares fell $1.0625, or 1.6 percent, to close at
$66.0625, the lowest since Oct. 14.

MEXICAN GRAY WOLF RELEASES SYMBOLIZE FRUSTRATIONS FOR AREA
RESIDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE YOZWIAK  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Greg Collins still wore blood-stained khaki pants as his friends
dragged him from the Bear Wallow Cafe _ the end of another
successful day of elk hunting in the heart of eastern Arizona wolf
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing wrong with wolves,'' said Collins, a hunter,
miner and coppersmith who lives in the hills near Silver City, N.M.
``(But) I will shoot a wolf on sight, and I'd like the FBI tagging
along. You are not going to tell me what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   If Collins' view seems contradictory, it reflects a deep-rooted
conflict many folks along the Arizona-New Mexico line have about
the federal government's program this year to repopulate the Apache
and Gila national forests with endangered Mexican gray wolves.
</P>
<P>
   Many here say they are not so much against the wolves, as they
are against what the wolf represents: the steady erosion of a
Western lifestyle dependent on mining, ranching and logging.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the wolves have been shot to death, a federal crime that
carries a potential fine of $100,000 and a year in prison. A
state-federal task force is investigating, but so far has not filed
charges against anyone. A $50,000 reward has been offered for the
capture of the wolf killers.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery surrounding the killings has led to claims of death
threats received by ranchers and environmentalists. But no one has
been harmed, and no sheep or cattle have been eaten by wolves.
</P>
<P>
   Between conflicting theories of intentional sabotage and random
accidents, Collins shares another theory that the wolves were
intentionally shot by different people in opportunistic moments of
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the big deal? You see a wolf, you shoot a wolf,'' said
Max Schowengerdt, a former Las Vegas, Nev., construction contractor
who recently retired to the mountains of western New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   To these hunters, the potential suspects in the wolf shootings
could include anyone in the economically depressed region, which
has an unemployment rate three times the states' averages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every truck that goes down this street has a gun in it. Does
that mean they're militia? No. It's because their daddy and their
daddy's daddy had guns,'' Schowengerdt said.
</P>
<P>
   There also are those who believe that the wolves were mistaken
for coyotes, even though wolves are nearly three times the size of
coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   Among those are Jess Carey, a former Catron County sheriff and
gun shop owner from Reserve, N.M., who was subpoenaed last month by
a federal grand jury investigating the wolf killings.
</P>
<P>
   Carey turned over reams of records, guns and ammunition to
special agents of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, anything that
related to the kinds of shell casings found near the dead wolves.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Fish and Wildlife Service says they have no
suspects, Carey said he was handed a piece of paper _ with his name
on it _ that listed the suspects in the wolf killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew each and every one of these people who bought these
guns, and not one of them was capable of shooting any wolves,''
Carey said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he could be so sure, he said, ``Because everyone of
those people are law-abiding citizens. And they're not going to go
out here and shoot a wolf.''
</P>
<P>
   For many, the wolves represent the latest intrusion by
environmentalists and federal land managers.
</P>
<P>
   Timber production has fallen throughout Arizona and New Mexico
as federal land managers move to comply with federal court orders
in lawsuits brought by environmentalists aimed as saving other
threatened and endangered wildlife such as the Mexican spotted owl.
</P>
<P>
   Falling copper prices also are forcing layoffs of hundreds of
miners in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   And ranchers are under pressure to cut back their herds in areas
where federal land managers move to restore rivers and streams
damaged by decades of overgrazing livestock.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Marks, for example, has cut his herds in half in recent
years, and he faces more cuts next year. At the same time, federal
officials plan to release at least one wolf pack near Bear Valley,
within a quarter-mile of spring calving areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``All they (wolves) have to do is find one stillborn calf, and
they'll be right on them,'' said Marks, who worked throughout the
summer to scare wolves away from his cattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of cooperation I'm getting,'' Marks said of
the releases planned near his ranch in the Blue Range Primitive
Area.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to their release into the wild, wolves have been put in
acclimation pens that ring the Primitive Area. After several weeks,
they are released into the forest. Four more wolves currently in
such pens will be released today. And at least two more wolf packs
will be released from acclimation pens in coming months.
</P>
<P>
   But the use of acclimation pens has led to accusations by
ranchers that the wolves _ which were raised in zoos and other
captive breeding facilities _ are too dependent on humans bringing
them food. Ranchers say that the wolves starved when they weren't
fed road-kill and that the wolves are attracted by the sound of
automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Parsons, Mexican wolf recovery leader for the Fish and
Wildlife Service, said wolves have learned on their own to hunt
wild game _ mostly elk, which compete with cattle for forage. The
wolves, he said, are afraid of people, but don't seem to move far
enough away to keep from being shot.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the ongoing reintroduction experiment, biologists
plan to release one or two pairs of wolves _ possibly by helicopter
_ directly into the Blue Range Primitive Area, a roadless zone
where mechanized vehicles are prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   No pens are allowed to be built inside the Primitive Area, and
wolves released there will be forced to fend for themselves right
from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, to avoid confusing them with coyotes, federal
officials are releasing the wolves today with brightly colored
radio collars and brightly painted markings on their hips.
</P>
<P>
   If these wolves are shot to death, it could only be by someone
who purposely wanted wolves dead. Because most mammals are
colorblind, the markings will not affect the wolves' ability to
hunt.
</P>
<P>
   But the new wolf-painting effort was criticized Thursday by
Peter Galvin, conservation biologist for the Tucson-based Southwest
Center for Biological Diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he believes coyote hunting should be outlawed in the
wolf recovery area.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting coyotes is a time-honored pastime in the rural
Southwest. Many believe that killing coyotes means more deer, elk
and antelope fawns will survive each spring. But biological studies
show that no matter how many coyotes are killed, they reproduce
rapidly, and quickly fill every ecological niche available.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, recent studies of wolves in Yellowstone National
Park show the one way to effectively remove coyotes is the
reintroduction of wolves. &QL;

PHOTOGRAPHER SUSPECTED OF TAPPING TOM CRUISE'S PHONE   CALL
</HEADLINE>

news files.)

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Federal authorities have arrested an L.A.-area
photographer, claiming he used a scanner to tap a movie-set cell
phone call between actors Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, then sold
the conversation to the tabloids.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Ford, 27, arrested Thursday, faces three counts of
wiretapping and could serve 15 years in prison if convicted. The
charges are related to the alleged interception of the cellular
phone call and the selling of the conversation, which appeared in
the June 30 issue of the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   A grand jury unsealed an indictment against Ford early this
week, and he was arrested about 6 a.m. Thursday by FBI agents at
his home in Studio City, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Gregory Jessner said the alleged
interception occurred in February on a Studio City movie set. The
U.S. Attorney's Office was contacted by Cruise's attorney after the
tabloid article was published.
</P>
<P>
   ``My understanding is that Mrs. Kidman was using a cellular
phone somewhere on the set of `Practical Magic,' and Mr. Cruise was
at home,'' Jessner said, adding that officials believe Ford was
following the actress.
</P>
<P>
   Ford was ushered into his bail hearing by federal marshals
Thursday afternoon and was released after his girlfriend pledged to
put up $10,000 for his release.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is scheduled to return to court Monday to enter a plea.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe story, headlined ``Is Tom Cruise's Marriage Hanging By
A Thread?'' does not mention Ford by name but quotes an anonymous
source. The article describes an angry conversation between Cruise
and Kidman but does not provide a transcript of the tape and even
suggests that it might be a fake.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe released a short statement, contending that it ``did
nothing illegal or improper in putting together this story.''
</P>
<P>
   Cruise and Kidman, through their publicist, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The couple met on the set of ``Days of Thunder,'' were later
married and acted together again in ``Far and Away.'' Their third
film together, Stanley Kubrick's ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' has been
shrouded in secrecy and is scheduled for release next year.
</P>
<P>
   Jessner, who called Ford a ``paparazzi,'' said the U.S.
Attorney's Office did not go after the cameraman because of the
celebrities' involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This crime is a crime we take very seriously,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Studio City is a Los Angeles suburb. &QL;

STERN: LEAGUE WANTS DEAL, NOT BROKEN UNION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ From his Manhattan office on a brisk December day, NBA
commissioner David Stern is watching a horror flick.
</P>
<P>
   The silence of not playing NBA games because of a labor impasse
is screeching in the din of constant lockout lingo. In the backdrop
is a ``drop-dead'' date to cancel the season, which indicates that
this grim picture might soon earn the title of ``The Lost Season.''
</P>
<P>
   In a wide-ranging interview with the Post-Intelligencer
Thursday, Stern hinted that this will be the last collective
bargaining agreement he will mediate as commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   He also acknowledged that it will be virtually impossible to put
together a season if there is no agreement when the calendar turns
to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   And Stern said he recognizes that the NBA will be ``mortally
wounded'' if the 1998-99 season does not commence at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah,'' Stern said, ``but I'm not making any ultimatums.
... We'll get the owners together at the appropriate time and ask
them what they want to do. We're starting to think about that now.
I don't mean to say it's tomorrow, but it certainly is looming.''
</P>
<P>
   It will take a little more than a monh to get the league up and
running again whenever a deal is done.
</P>
<P>
   Stern does not know when he will negotiate with the players'
union again. Talks have been on-again and off-again _ mostly off _
this month. His relationship with the players is more strained than
it has ever been, but he disputes the notion he is attempting to
break their union.
</P>
<P>
   The intention, says Stern, is to strike a deal with this union
leadership so that both sides can continue to prosper long after
his reign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal has to be long enough so that the person negotiating
its successor is my successor,'' Stern said. ``If it's a six-year
deal, it could very well be (my last). I would like to leave the
league in good shape. That's why I'm leading this negotiating
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern remains miffed that player agents appear to carry great
influence over the union.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something holding our players back, and that is
they're being told by their experts that they don't want to make a
deal that's too good for the owners,'' Stern said. ``In other
words, they're not saying, `Is this a good deal for the players?'
What they're saying is this conceivably could be too good a deal
for the owners. And the owners are saying, `Show us.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The players have been told, `Stern said this isn't his last
offer so therefore he's got another offer. He's hiding from us.' I
don't know what that offer is. ... The owners' views have to be
softened and the players' views have to be softened, then a deal
has to emerge. That's the way it's always worked. It's just not
working this time.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the squabble over percentages and basketball-related
income (BRI), it is clear that the labor dispute is a power
struggle that has been derailed by blanket mistrust.
</P>
<P>
   On the subject of whether the basketball-related income that is
divided among the owners and players is calculated fairly, Stern
said:
</P>
<P>
   ``When they said let's reconstitute the BRI, we said that's
easy. Let's do it. That was weeks ago,'' Stern said, adding that
the ``mistrust issue is one that has been utilized by those who are
exhorting the players so that they can keep them unified under the
certainty that the owners would yield. We trust the players and
it's become convenient for them to say they don't trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the league's assertion that teams are losing money is
correct, Stern is adamant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players have the books. Their own expert says the trend is
down,'' he said. ``I say call Charles Bennett (a forensic
accountant who works for the players). Ask him whatever you want to
ask him. I have a great deal of confidence in his assessment.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett told the P-I last month that he was comfortable with the
BRI figures as compiled by the owners.
</P>
<P>
   The league contends that close to 10 teams received revenue
assistance last year. The most handed out was $2.9 million,
according to deputy commissioner Russ Granik.
</P>
<P>
   The players' argument is that the issue of financial losses does
not account for what they see as mismanagement prevalent in certain
franchises. They cite the Milwaukee Bucks _ and owner Herb Kohl _
as an example.
</P>
<P>
   His payroll was roughly $25 million last season. Kohl, who is
worth an estimated $200 million, is reportedly paying three
coaches. Former Sonic coach George Karl was recently hired for $20
million over four years. His predecessors, Chris Ford and Mike
Dunleavy, were fired before their contracts ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Owners are obviously taking money out of their pockets to
subsidize their teams,'' Stern said. ``But collective bargaining is
where you stop that. Is the question whether Herb Kohl can afford
to lose a couple of million dollars a year? Sure. But this is where
you get the chance to say, `I don't want to do it anymore.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The owners reopened the collective bargaining agreement after
player salaries accounted for 57 percent of basketball-related
income. Despite the fact that league revenue has quadrupled since
1984, Stern's analogy is that now whenever the league generates $2,
the players are making $4.
</P>
<P>
   The owners' latest proposal is a seven-year structured plan in
which the average salary is projected to go from $3 million to $4.9
million. The percentage of BRI devoted to salaries would start at
57 percent for the 1998-99 season and curtail to 53.5 percent in
2004-05, with a low of 52 in the middle year of the deal. The
players want a 60-percent cut and an open-ended pay scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always leeway. But there are so many different issues,
there has to be some trading going on,'' Stern said. ``When we say
that, they say we're holding back an offer. The only way the two
parties can get together is to say we really need this but we're
prepared to give a little on that. But you need to do this and
we'll do that. That's the way it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   There is just this one major snag: Nothing is going on right
now. This is the 164th day of the lockout. There is no end in
sight, and Stern remains firm in his seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players will lose in excess of a billion dollars if the
season is canceled. They're telling us that they're willing to give
that up so the owners can't make another 50 or 60 or 70 million a
year?'' Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never asked them to take less absolute dollars. We've
always assured them salaries would grow. We just wanted to adjust
the percentage. If we have a fundamental economic model that works,
the amount of money that we and the players can make collectively
is so much larger than the amount we're fighting about, it's
frightening.''

VARGAS UP TO CHALLENGE OF DETHRONING CAMPAS  
 OPEN-AND-SHUT TYSON  
 HAMED AND INGLE SPLIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Nev., N.J., N.Y.)  (js) 
 By TIMOTHY SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fernando Vargas will be the second member of the 1996 U.S.
Olympic boxing team to go for a world championship when he faces
Yory Boy Campas, the International Boxing Federation junior
middleweight champion, Saturday night at the Trump Taj Mahal in
Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest question is whether this fight is too big a step for
Vargas. Yes, Vargas is the No. 1 contender; yes, he is 14-0 and has
knocked out all of his opponents. But he will be giving away 59
fights worth of experience to Campas (71-2).
</P>
<P>
   The bout will be the co-feature with the rematch of two
lightweights, Arturo Gatti and Ivan Robinson, to be broadcast on
HBO.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas is not worried about being in over his head. ``It's not
about having 50 or 60 fights to be a great fighter,'' he said.
``Yory Boy Campas is there to be taken. I feel like I'm the man to
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Campas' only two losses in his career have been against Felix
Trinidad and Jose Luis Lopez _ two tough welterweights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Against Trinidad, I lost because I went into the bout with a
fractured nose,'' Campas said. ``Against Lopez, I had to lose six
to seven pounds in the final days to make weight. By fight time, I
had nothing left.''
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Diaz, Campas' trainer, said Campas is comfortable now
that he has moved up to 154 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in better shape than he was when he won the title against
Raul Marquez,'' Diaz said.
</P>
<P>
   OPEN-AND-SHUT TYSON
</P>
<P>
   Mike Tyson was more unbridled in his opinions in two interviews
he had in Phoenix on Monday than he was during his Los Angeles news
conference Tuesday to announce his fight against Francois Botha on
Jan. 16.
</P>
<P>
   During the news conference Tuesday, Tyson would not address the
prospect of his probation being revoked and his having to return to
prison in Indiana, except to make a quick joke about it. But in
interviews on Monday, Tyson said he is not afraid to return to
prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I went back to prison, it wouldn't be because I violated
anyone,'' Tyson said. ``I didn't do anything to go back. If they
send me back to prison, I can handle it. I'm not a wimp. I'm no
chump. I'm not afraid of anything, except God.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson has apologized to Evander Holyfield for biting his ears
during their bout on June 28, 1997. But after his workout on
Monday, Tyson wasn't so conciliatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was butting me,'' Tyson said. ``Yeah, I bit his ears. He's
lucky I didn't bite his throat. He's a boxer. He knew what he did
was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson thinks the Nevada State Athletic Commission set up a
battery of psychological and psychiatric exams by doctors at
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston hoping that he would fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put me through that test thinking I wasn't going to pass
it,'' Tyson said. ``They probably thought I would blow up during
the hearing, do something crazy and they wouldn't have to give it
to me. One of the doctors told me before the tests that these are
the same tests that they give to astronauts. I'm no astronaut. I'm
an 11th-grade dropout.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson explained his occasional outbursts by saying: ``I don't
think I have any rage. I think I'm like anybody else. I get upset.
I just think I have a different way of showing it.''
</P>
<P>
   HAMED AND INGLE SPLIT
</P>
<P>
   Prince Naseem Hamed, the flamboyant featherweight, has dismissed
his longtime trainer, Brendan Ingle, and is looking for a new
trainer.
</P>
<P>
   Hamed dropped Ingle, the only trainer he has had, because Ingle
professed loyalty to the promoter Frank Warren, whom Hamed also
split from. . . . Roy Jones, Jr., will fight Richard Frazier, a New
York City police officer, in Pensacola, Fla., on Jan. 9. Frazier is
the WBC's No. 1 contender for Jones' light heavyweight title and
jumped in front of David Telasco when Jones could not reach a deal
with Telasco. Shane Mosley, the IBF lightweight champion, will be
on the undercard, possibly against Justin Rowsell of Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Rene Gil, the manager for Diobelys Hurtado, is protesting
Hurtado's loss to Kostya Tszyu on Nov. 28 to the WBC, because the
bout took place in a 17-foot ring, instead of the contracted
20-foot ring. Gil wants a rematch before Tszyu fights Miguel Angel
Gonzalez. . . . Ron Scott Stevens, a Brooklyn promoter, has joined
Cedric Kushner Promotions as a matchmaker.  &QL;

NBA LOCKOUT DISPLAYS LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Should you or anyone you know become part of the
swirling, snarling mass of shoppers in Manhattan this Christmas
season, here's my handy survival tip:
</P>
<P>
   Find the famed Fifth Avenue shopping district and slip into the
NBA Store at 52nd Street.
</P>
<P>
   It's peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of room. Lots of bored sales personnel. Lots of weird
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Such as a large vase made of Waterford crystal, etched with a
figure of Larry Bird. A fine stocking stuffer for just $8,000.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps your taste runs to $150 Hugo Boss shirts, $500 gold
cuff links or $1,800 leather jackets _ all emblazoned with the logo
and icons of an epically dysfunctional industry. In light of
current events, the store felt like a welcome-back party for the
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning after the Seahawk game in New Jersey, I wandered
through the quiet store, blinking in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   Who would buy this stuff, I wondered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rich foreigners,'' came an answer from nearby.
</P>
<P>
   That was a relief. I was worried there might be an American
sports fan possessed of more credit cards than brain cells.
</P>
<P>
   At almost the same time I was fingering a $300 logo-festooned
sweater, the NBA players, led by agent/viper David Falk, were
making an announcement about a charity game Dec. 19 in Atlantic
City, proceeds from which would go, in part, to benefit their
brethren suffering from the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that the worst-off player in the NBA last year made
$272,500, or 36 percent more than the president.
</P>
<P>
   If this were England, the gesture would be equivalent to having
the royal family hold a bake sale to help out the Rolling Stones
between concert tours.
</P>
<P>
   After considering the greedy, preening indulgence of the NBA
Store and the stupendous arrogance of the players with the charity
game, a thought occurred:
</P>
<P>
   I have never seen a sports enterprise so nakedly and publicly
disconnected from its fan base.
</P>
<P>
   And it happened barely more than a decade after the league was
begging for the sporting public's attention.
</P>
<P>
   Astonishing. Absolutely astonishing.
</P>
<P>
   Is the NBA situation worse than the labor problems that have
shut down other pro sports? Yes, because it comes after all the
mistakes made by other leagues and unions, and because there was no
discernible reason for the stoppage.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did neither side in the NBA dispute learn from the
disasters of its sports predecessors, there was no obvious evidence
that pro basketball was in serious trouble. In the cases of the
other labor travails, a labor-management imbalance at least could
be argued.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last several years, the biggest NBA economic news was
almost always good: Successful expansion, massive globalization,
Olympic glory, full houses and improving ratings, big TV contracts
and widespread acknowledgment as the hippest, hottest mainstream
sport going.
</P>
<P>
   Then suddenly, Commissioner David Stern stood before the sports
world with his pockets inside out, declared a crisis and shut down
the industry.
</P>
<P>
   While continuing to sign players to unfathomable contracts, the
owners and Stern flat failed to make the public case that the
building was on fire.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, they failed to make believers of the players.
</P>
<P>
   By choosing to market glamorous individuals instead of teams or
the game itself, the NBA created a Frankenstein monster.
</P>
<P>
   The players believe, as the charity fiasco attests, that they
are more important than the game. Surrounded by sycophants,
entourages and the NBA's ravenous marketing machine, the players'
profoundly distorted sense of worth fairly screams.
</P>
<P>
   When Nick Anderson says he may have to sell one of his eight
luxury vehicles to make ends meet, when Gary Payton suggests that
the lockout isn't hurting players as much as fans, when the lockout
``victims'' arrive in stretch limos to union events held only in
Vegas or Atlantic City in order to assure attendance, it's plain
they have no idea how insulting they appear.
</P>
<P>
   They've never been told no in their adult lives. They don't know
how to act.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the negotiating posture: They reduce the economic
issues to a childish pout of macho competitiveness in which they
fear disrespect more than defeat. They allow the negotiations to be
done by ruthless agents who fear for their careers if they either
let down a rich player or allow the NBA to implement a salary scale
that reduces the need for agents.
</P>
<P>
   The belief in entitlement that is corrupting the union position
is a far cry from 1984, when the league and union created a
landmark collective bargaining agreement that was the foundation of
the NBA's remarkable success. The league then was in serious
trouble, made the case clearly to players and agents, who then
joined with the league in an unprecedented partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Half a generation later, the partnership has vanished, players
lost in self-absorption, owners deluded by rapid success.
</P>
<P>
   The season no longer is worth saving. The disconnection is
severe enough to wonder whether the league and its players ever
will be worth bringing back from their parallel universe.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Federal authorities have arrested an L.A.-area
photographer, claiming he used a scanner to tap a movie-set cell
phone call between actors Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, then sold
the conversation to the tabloids.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Ford, 27, arrested Thursday, faces three counts of
wiretapping and could serve 15 years in prison if convicted. The
charges are related to the alleged interception of the cellular
phone call and the selling of the conversation, which appeared in
the June 30 issue of the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   A grand jury unsealed an indictment against Ford early this
week, and he was arrested about 6 a.m. Thursday by FBI agents at
his home in Studio City, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Gregory Jessner said the alleged
interception occurred in February on a Studio City movie set. The
U.S. Attorney's Office was contacted by Cruise's attorney after the
tabloid article was published.
</P>
<P>
   ``My understanding is that Mrs. Kidman was using a cellular
phone somewhere on the set of `Practical Magic,' and Mr. Cruise was
at home,'' Jessner said, adding that officials believe Ford was
following the actress.
</P>
<P>
   Ford was ushered into his bail hearing by federal marshals
Thursday afternoon and was released after his girlfriend pledged to
put up $10,000 for his release.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is scheduled to return to court Monday to enter a plea.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe story, headlined ``Is Tom Cruise's Marriage Hanging By
A Thread?'' does not mention Ford by name but quotes an anonymous
source. The article describes an angry conversation between Cruise
and Kidman but does not provide a transcript of the tape and even
suggests that it might be a fake.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe released a short statement, contending that it ``did
nothing illegal or improper in putting together this story.''
</P>
<P>
   Cruise and Kidman, through their publicist, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The couple met on the set of ``Days of Thunder,'' were later
married and acted together again in ``Far and Away.'' Their third
film together, Stanley Kubrick's ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' has been
shrouded in secrecy and is scheduled for release next year.
</P>
<P>
   Jessner, who called Ford a ``paparazzi,'' said the U.S.
Attorney's Office did not go after the cameraman because of the
celebrities' involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This crime is a crime we take very seriously,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Studio City is a Los Angeles suburb. &QL;

AETNA TO ACQUIRE PRUDENTIAL'S AILING HEALTH BUSINESS

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After seeking a buyer for more than a year,
Prudential Insurance Co. of America finally found one for its
struggling health care division.
</P>
<P>
   Hartford, Conn.-based Aetna, already one of the nation's largest
insurers, said Thursday that it will pay $1 billion in cash and
debt for the 6.6 million-member Prudential HealthCare, whose
Western headquarters is in the L.A. suburb of Woodland Hills. The
proposed acquisition would make Aetna the nation's largest
commercial health insurer, with 22.4 million members.
</P>
<P>
   By combining the two businesses, Aetna said it expects to
achieve annual cost savings of between $130 million and $150
million. The company will achieve that in part by cutting between
1,000 and 2,000 jobs from the combined entity, said Aetna Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Richard Huber, though it will ``rely as
much as possible on attrition and growth in our business as we
streamline operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Aetna has 32,000 employees, while Prudential HealthCare has
about 16,000.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential spokeswoman Peggy Frank-Lyle said the Woodland Hills
regional headquarters will remain open once Aetna owns the
division, along with Prudential's four regional administrative
centers, one of which is located in downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   News of the proposed purchase brought relief mixed with concern
over the future to local Prudential employees who have been working
for more than a year with the knowledge that their employer was up
for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of uncertainty,'' said Jorge Martin, a former
marketing employee at Prudential who was laid off in a round of
cost cutting last year. ``People are taking a wait-and-see
attitude. There's nothing imminent, but people think they may be
looking for a job a year from now, or two years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   If approved by regulators, the purchase would be the third big
buy for Aetna in the health care arena in the past two years. The
company earlier this year bought New York Life's health business
for $1.05 billion, and in 1996 purchased U.S. Healthcare for $8.9
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's deal would bring Aetna new members at a cost of less
than $200 apiece, compared with the $500 to $600 it typically costs
to win a new customer through advertising and marketing efforts. It
paid $600 per member for NYLCare's customers and about $1,000 per
member for U.S. Healthcare's.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential HealthCare runs managed-care plans in more than 40
metropolitan locations. The proposed purchase would make Aetna
among the top-three managed-care providers in New York,
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Texas, Maryland, Florida, Georgia,
Virginia and Ohio. In California, however, it would remain behind
the likes of Kaiser Permanente and Foundation Health Systems'
Health Net HMO.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the 600,000 California members of Prudential health
plans will not be affected by the acquisition, company officials
said, and it could take up to two years to fully integrate the two
systems. Ultimately, the deal should give members in both
companies' health plans a choice of more doctors and services,
Frank-Lyle said.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Prudential sale was long anticipated _ the company
had been looking for a buyer since fall 1997 _ there was no clear
front-runner to make the buy. Both Woodland Hills-based WellPoint
Health Networks and Louisville-based Humana Corp. had earlier held
talks with Prudential to no effect. WellPoint reportedly balked at
the $1 billion price tag and Humana was distracted by merger talks
with United HealthCare Corp. that eventually proved fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna had shown some early interest, but disappointing earnings
last year made the deal appear unlikely. A subsequent improvement
in Aetna's books looks to have made the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential Insurance was prompted to sell its health business
after several years of losses at the division. Though generating
more than $6 billion in annual revenues, the division has lost
money for at least the last five years, $200 million in 1996 alone.
Intense cost cutting and more aggressive marketing has helped the
plan to a certain degree.
</P>
<P>
   In California, managed-care veteran Cora Tellez was brought in
in late 1997 as president of the sprawling Western division, which
includes California, Colorado, Arizona and Utah, and helped limit
losses there to about $5 million in fiscal 1997. But the
well-respected Tellez was wooed away last month by Foundation's
Health Net HMO, where she now serves as the plan's chief executive
officer. &QL;

SCALABRINE WON'T MISS KANSAS ANYMORE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   USC forward Brian Scalabrine admits that if he could have picked
any school in the country to play basketball for, it would have
been Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``My true dream was to play for Kansas,'' Scalabrine said. ``But
I'll get to play (begin ital)against(end ital) Kansas instead.''
</P>
<P>
   The 10th-ranked Jayhawks, who host the Trojans on Saturday
night, gave Scalabrine just a cursory glance while he was junior
college, after he had mailed them some tapes of his games.
</P>
<P>
   ``They called me back as a courtesy call,'' Scalabrine said.
``Nothing else.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas is probably regretting its decision today. With depth
problems along the front line, and the loss of junior forward
Lester Earl, who is out 10 days after having arthroscopic surgery
on his knee, Scalabrine might look good in blue and red.
</P>
<P>
   So will Scalabrine have revenge on his mind Saturday night, when
USC plays at Allen Fieldhouse?
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to win,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   How big a game is it? Scalabrine was asked if he thought USC's
trip to Kansas was a chance for the Trojans to gain national
prestige and earn respect from basketball observers across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you guys think so, I think so too,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby speaks: USC coach Henry Bibby said Monday he didn't know
anything about Kansas, because he was only concerned about Loyola
Marymount, a team the Trojans defeated 79-43 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, he was ready to focus on the Jayhawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a good test for us,'' Bibby said. ``Kansas is
coming off a tough loss, so their intensity level will be up.''
</P>
<P>
   Setting the tempo: Bibby feels the key to the Kansas game will
be controlling the pace against the Jayhawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to set the tempo right away,'' Bibby said. ``We
can't wait until the second half. We'll have problems if we don't
come out ready to play. I hope we can go into Kansas and set the
tempo early and go after them.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilder's back: Guard Quincy Wilder has practiced all week after
going AWOL last week. Wilder considered leaving the team because he
was unhappy over playing time. He played eight minutes against
Loyola Marymount, and had two points and three rebounds.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC defensive coordinator Bill Young lost out to
San Diego Chargers interim coach June Jones for the head-coaching
position at the University of Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was named Hawaii's coach on Thursday afternoon, two days
after Hawaii interviewed him and Young in Southern California.
Hawaii officials told Young he was their second choice for the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's flattering to even be considered,'' Young said. ``I've
got a great place to be right here. It may be a blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   Other candidates for the job included Arizona assistant coach
Duane Akina and Utah coach Ron McBride, who withdrew himself from
consideration Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Football awards: Linebacker Chris Claiborne was named most
valuable player at USC's football awards banquet Thursday night at
the Biltmore Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Senior defensive tackle Marc Matock was named most inspirational
player, after returning from a midseason broken ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Other winners were offensive guard Travis Claridge and defensive
tackle Ennis Davis for linemen of the year; free safety Ifeanyi
Ohalete for special teams player of the year; offensive guard Zach
Wilson and linebacker Rocky Seto for top scout team players; free
safety Rashard Cook for player of the game against Notre Dame;
tailback Frank Strong for longest run of the season; kicker Adam
Abrams for academic achievement and defensive tackle Aaron Williams
for underclassman with outstanding athletic ability, academics and
character.

DEVILS BEAT FLYERS IN OVERTIME, 5-4 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The New Jersey Devils had spent the past few days
wondering where the defensive prowess that had carried them in
recent years had gone. In the opening minutes of Thursday night's
game, little changed as they found themselves in a three-goal hole.
But the Devils' recently discovered offensive prowess came to the
rescue and they posted a dramatic 5-4 overtime victory over the
Philadelphia Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite surrendering 14 goals in their past three games, the
Devils have managed a pair of victories and a tie amid a six-game
unbeaten streak. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The decisive goal came 1 minute 18 seconds into overtime when
Dave Andreychuk finally pounded in a rebound after the Devils
pelted four shots at a bewildered Ron Hextall. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After surrendering four goals on the first 14 shots by the
Flyers, spanning the first 20:40, Martin Brodeur closed the
revolving door to the Devils' net. He stopped the final 15 shots of
regulation, although a pair of blasts by Eric Lindros hit the post,
and Brodeur was lucky to survive another Lindros slap shot from
just inside the blue line that hit his chest and bounded into his
face, knocking him off his feet. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With Brodeur finally stopping the Flyers' onslaught, the Devils
rallied from the sizable deficit, tying the score with 7:21
remaining in the third period when Randy McKay stole the puck from
Luke Richardson behind the Flyers' net and slid the puck to Bobby
Holik, who was stopped by Hextall on his first attempt but stuffed
the rebound into the right side of the net. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, just to get into overtime the Devils had to survive a
late flurry that included a bullet by John LeClair, a point-blank
chance by Lindros and then LeClair circling in front of the net as
time expired. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scott Stevens, who missed Tuesday night's game with the flu,
joined the Devils for the morning skate on Thursday and felt well
enough to take the ice on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   But getting their captain back did little to stop the flood of
goals that the Devils have been letting in of late. After
surrendering five goals on Saturday to the Islanders and five more
in the tie with the Flyers on Tuesday, the Devils were pelted for
13 shots and 3 goals in the first period. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Devils took a 1-0 lead with a power-play goal by Petr Sykora
just 4:12 into the game on a pretty pass between his legs by Jason
Arnott. But just as they had squandered leads of 3-2 and 5-3 on
Tuesday to the Flyers, they gave this lead up quickly _ 1:04 later.
</P>
<P>
   LeClair slipped a pass from behind the net to Lindros near the
right circle, and Lindros drilled the puck past Brodeur for his
15th goal of the season and sixth against the Devils. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the Flyers got a power-play opportunity at 8:16, it took
them just five seconds to take advantage, after winning the
face-off in front of the Devils' net. LeClair took a pass in front
from Eric Desjardins and tried one backhand that was stopped before
he banged in his own rebound.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers added a short-handed goal with 2:54 left in the
period, taking advantage of a lackluster effort by the Devils.
First Arnott fanned on the puck while trying to keep it in along
the boards. Then the Flyers' Rod Brind'Amour beat Vadim
Sharifijanov to the puck as it crossed the blue line into the
Devils' defensive zone, centering the puck to Petr Svoboda, who
outraced Scott Niedermayer to the net and slipped the puck past
Brodeur's glove. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Things did not improve immediately for the Devils after the
intermission, with the Flyers getting their fourth goal just 40
seconds into the second period when Lindros beat Lyle Odelin,
flicking a shot into the near side of the net. &QL;

MERLE GILLIAND, 76, WHO LED GROWTH OF PNC BANK  
 LAMOND GODWIN, 56, PORTFOLIO MANAGER AND EDUCATOR  
 WILLIAM NOONAN, 66, PUBLIC RELATIONS EXECUTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Fla., Ga., Mass., Calif., N.J.)  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
 &HT;    Merle Gilliand, retired chairman and chief executive of PNC Bank
Corp., who presided over several mergers of the bank holding
company over 30 years, died on Tuesday at the UPMC St. Margaret
Hospital in Pittsburgh. He was 76.
 &HT;    Gilliand, a resident of Fox Chapel, Pa., and Naples, Fla., was
recently diagnosed with cancer.
 &HT;    Gilliand joined the accounting department of People's First
National Bank and Trust Co. in 1953, after a five-year stint as a
certified public accountant. As controller six years later, he
negotiated the merger with Fidelity Trust Co. of Pittsburgh that
created Pittsburgh National Bank. From 1970 until 1983, he was
chairman and chief executive of the bank.
 &HT;    In 1983, as chairman and chief executive officer of Pittsburgh
National and its holding company, he led the merger with Provident
National Bank of Philadelphia, creating PNC Financial Corp. Later
acquisitions of Pennsylvania banks included Marin Bank of Erie;
Northeastern Bank in Scranton and Wilkes Barre; and Hershey Bank in
central Pennsylvania.
 &HT;    When Gilliand retired as chairman and chief executive in 1985,
the bank holding company was the United States' 27th-largest, with
close to $15 billion in assets. He continued to serve as a director
and chairman of the board's executive committee until 1992.
 &HT;    The son of a house painter, Gilliand was a 1948 graduate of
Duquesne University with a bachelor's degree in business
administration. He was an ardent fan of the school's sports teams
and often helped arrange job interviews for former athletes.
 &HT;    After he retired, the bank established the Merle E. Gilliand
Scholarship fund at the university. He served in the Army as a
first lieutenant in World War II. He also served as president of
the Federal Advisory Council of the Federal Reserve System, a
congressionally mandated group of bankers that meets regularly with
the central bank's top officials.
 &HT;    He is survived by his wife, Olive Lee, of Fox Chapel and Naples,
and a cousin, Doris Morley. A son, Mark, died previously.

   Lamond Godwin, 56, Portfolio Manager and Educator
</P>
<P>
   Lamond Godwin, the chairman and chief executive of Peachtree
Asset Management, a division of Salomon Smith Barney, died on Nov.
15 at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. Godwin, a resident of
Atlanta, was 56.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was a heart attack, said his son, Lamond
Charles Godwin.
</P>
<P>
   Godwin founded Peachtree Asset Management, which manages large
equity portfolios for corporations, pension funds, endowments and
other institutional clients, in 1994. He was also a managing
director of Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Godwin joined American Express Bank, a division of American
Express Co., as senior director and first vice president in 1986.
Later he served as senior vice president in the asset management
group of Shearson Lehman Brothers, which was owned by American
Express. Smith Barney bought Shearson in 1992 and Salomon Brothers
last year.
</P>
<P>
   After he graduated from Clark College, which is now Clark
Atlanta University, in 1964 with a bachelor's degree in economics,
Godwin earned a master's degree in economics from the University of
Illinois in Urbana-Champaign in 1967. He also studied at the
European Institute for Business Administration in Fontainebleau,
France.
</P>
<P>
   Godwin held several positions in higher education, including
senior research associate at the Wharton Applied Research Center at
the University of Pennsylvania and resident fellow at the John F.
Kennedy School of government at Harvard University. During the
Carter administration, Godwin was the director of national programs
for the Employment and Training Administration in the Department of
Labor.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Thelma, of Atlanta; his daughter,
Agnes Godwin Hall, of Atlanta; his son, Lamond Charles, of San
Diego, and a sister, Edna Godwin Easton, of Mobile, Ala.

   William Noonan, 66, Public Relations Executive
</P>
<P>
   William Noonan, who helped build Burson-Marsteller into a global
leader in public relations, died Nov. 2 at his home in Franklin
Township, N.J. He was 66 and suffered from leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   Noonan served 32 years at Burson-Marsteller, including eight as
president and vice chairman. Under his leadership, the New
York-based firm expanded globally.
</P>
<P>
   While directing the firm's international operations, Noonan
helped oversee operations in East Asia and was involved in the
firm's business in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Noonan retired from Burson-Marsteller in 1994 and became a
co-owner of Princeton Public Relations Group, a marketing and
corporate public relations firm.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Irvington, N.J., and attended parochial schools
there before earning his bachelor's degree at the University of
Notre Dame. Later he served on the university's public relations
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Noonan is survived by his wife, Alyce Normoyle Noonan; three
sons, William of Bensalem, Pa., Robert of Ferndale, Pa., and Thomas
of Union, N.J., and a daughter, Carol Roberts of Franklin Township,
all from his marriage to Jean Noonan, now deceased; two daughters
from his current marriage, Jessica and Shannon Noonan; five
grandchildren; and two sisters, Kay Rafter of Jensen Beach, Fla.,
and Rita Kirk of Florham Park, N.J.

NBA LOCKOUT DISPLAYS LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 Fixing reference of Anderson to Kenny   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Should you or anyone you know become part of the
swirling, snarling mass of shoppers in Manhattan this Christmas
season, here's my handy survival tip:
</P>
<P>
   Find the famed Fifth Avenue shopping district and slip into the
NBA Store at 52nd Street.
</P>
<P>
   It's peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of room. Lots of bored sales personnel. Lots of weird
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Such as a large vase made of Waterford crystal, etched with a
figure of Larry Bird. A fine stocking stuffer for just $8,000.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps your taste runs to $150 Hugo Boss shirts, $500 gold
cuff links or $1,800 leather jackets _ all emblazoned with the logo
and icons of an epically dysfunctional industry. In light of
current events, the store felt like a welcome-back party for the
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning after the Seahawk game in New Jersey, I wandered
through the quiet store, blinking in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   Who would buy this stuff, I wondered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rich foreigners,'' came an answer from nearby.
</P>
<P>
   That was a relief. I was worried there might be an American
sports fan possessed of more credit cards than brain cells.
</P>
<P>
   At almost the same time I was fingering a $300 logo-festooned
sweater, the NBA players, led by agent/viper David Falk, were
making an announcement about a charity game Dec. 19 in Atlantic
City, proceeds from which would go, in part, to benefit their
brethren suffering from the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that the worst-off player in the NBA last year made
$272,500, or 36 percent more than the president.
</P>
<P>
   If this were England, the gesture would be equivalent to having
the royal family hold a bake sale to help out the Rolling Stones
between concert tours.
</P>
<P>
   After considering the greedy, preening indulgence of the NBA
Store and the stupendous arrogance of the players with the charity
game, a thought occurred:
</P>
<P>
   I have never seen a sports enterprise so nakedly and publicly
disconnected from its fan base.
</P>
<P>
   And it happened barely more than a decade after the league was
begging for the sporting public's attention.
</P>
<P>
   Astonishing. Absolutely astonishing.
</P>
<P>
   Is the NBA situation worse than the labor problems that have
shut down other pro sports? Yes, because it comes after all the
mistakes made by other leagues and unions, and because there was no
discernible reason for the stoppage.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did neither side in the NBA dispute learn from the
disasters of its sports predecessors, there was no obvious evidence
that pro basketball was in serious trouble. In the cases of the
other labor travails, a labor-management imbalance at least could
be argued.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last several years, the biggest NBA economic news was
almost always good: Successful expansion, massive globalization,
Olympic glory, full houses and improving ratings, big TV contracts
and widespread acknowledgment as the hippest, hottest mainstream
sport going.
</P>
<P>
   Then suddenly, Commissioner David Stern stood before the sports
world with his pockets inside out, declared a crisis and shut down
the industry.
</P>
<P>
   While continuing to sign players to unfathomable contracts, the
owners and Stern flat failed to make the public case that the
building was on fire.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, they failed to make believers of the players.
</P>
<P>
   By choosing to market glamorous individuals instead of teams or
the game itself, the NBA created a Frankenstein monster.
</P>
<P>
   The players believe, as the charity fiasco attests, that they
are more important than the game. Surrounded by sycophants,
entourages and the NBA's ravenous marketing machine, the players'
profoundly distorted sense of worth fairly screams.
</P>
<P>
   When Kenny Anderson says he may have to sell one of his eight
luxury vehicles to make ends meet, when Gary Payton suggests that
the lockout isn't hurting players as much as fans, when the lockout
``victims'' arrive in stretch limos to union events held only in
Vegas or Atlantic City in order to assure attendance, it's plain
they have no idea how insulting they appear.
</P>
<P>
   They've never been told no in their adult lives. They don't know
how to act.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the negotiating posture: They reduce the economic
issues to a childish pout of macho competitiveness in which they
fear disrespect more than defeat. They allow the negotiations to be
done by ruthless agents who fear for their careers if they either
let down a rich player or allow the NBA to implement a salary scale
that reduces the need for agents.
</P>
<P>
   The belief in entitlement that is corrupting the union position
is a far cry from 1984, when the league and union created a
landmark collective bargaining agreement that was the foundation of
the NBA's remarkable success. The league then was in serious
trouble, made the case clearly to players and agents, who then
joined with the league in an unprecedented partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Half a generation later, the partnership has vanished, players
lost in self-absorption, owners deluded by rapid success.
</P>
<P>
   The season no longer is worth saving. The disconnection is
severe enough to wonder whether the league and its players ever
will be worth bringing back from their parallel universe.
</P>

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NEAL FARMER  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
There was another high for Kansas State football coach Bill Snyder
in a season of highs and lows after he was announced Thursday as
the recipient of the 1998 Paul ``Bear'' Bryant Coach of the Year
Award at the Westin Galleria.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``They were virtually all highs until the last play of the last
ballgame,'' Snyder said. ``We've been fortunate to work in that
realm.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was honored to take home the hardware during such an
emotional time for him and his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are an awful lot of far better football coaches than I
am in this country,'' said Snyder, who was a Bryant finalist in '93
and '95. ``I've been humbled (to be in Houston) three times for
this award. When you think about Paul `Bear' Bryant, that is
special. Just to be mentioned in the same breath as him is very
dynamic for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had coached better, we would be here with a 12-0 record
instead of 11-1. And we've been 11-1 before, so it is not new. I
think the fact that a lot of very positive things have happened at
Kansas State, and this year just happened to be part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State's 36-33 double-overtime loss to Texas A&AMP;M in the
Big 12 Championship Game on Saturday in St. Louis resulted in the
team not only missing the Bowl Championship Series but the Cotton
and Holiday bowl berths as well. The Wildcats are matched against
Purdue on Dec. 29 in the Alamo Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder had a short answer when asked if winning the Bryant award
would ease the hurt of losing to Texas A&AMP;M and all that it
entailed: ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This has nothing to do with it, because the wounds I am able
to handle with time,'' Snyder said. ``It has been devastating, I
think, but my concerns are not with me as they are with the
players, the direction they go and how they respond to this. So,
no, this does not soothe those wounds. I am honored by it, but
that's a whole different agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder's record at K-State is 77-38-1 in 10 years, impressive
since the Wildcats lost with regularity in the 1950s through 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of what has taken place and have some positive
feelings for it,'' Snyder said. ``But who I am excited for and
proud of are all those young people who came into our program 10
years ago and had no success whatsoever at Kansas State. They
toiled every bit as much as the young people we have now and didn't
have the opportunity to reap the benefits we have now.''
</P>
<P>
   The other finalists were Tennessee's Phil Fulmer, Tulane's Tommy
Bowden, Ohio State's John Cooper, Arkansas' Houston Nutt and UCLA's
Bob Toledo. The voting was a two-tiered process by the 800-member
National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association.
</P>
<P>
   Only Snyder came to Houston, as the other schools sent
assistants in the place of their head coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the head coaches who were finalists in Houston also were
finalists for the Eddie Robinson Coach of the Year Award ceremony
in Orlando, Fla., and they chose to go to the Florida event
Thursday. Houston organizers said they are not concerned about what
the other coaches did, as this year's banquet was highly
successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to raise more than $150,000 _ net _ for the
American Heart Association,'' event chairman Jerel T. Humphrey
said. ``We always like to get as many of the finalists as possible,
but obviously, circumstances being what they may, is difficult. But
people come here to support the American Heart Association. Having
more coaches here is just icing on the cake.''
</P>
<P>
   American Heart Association officials said that coaches who went
to Orlando were asked to sign a contract saying that they would
attend that banquet. No such contract is required in Houston,
according to Humphrey.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kicked that around,'' Humphrey said. ``Each year we have an
evaluation that we go through and ask what can we do differently?
That is something we have not decided to do. Some of the events
want the coaches to agree to come before they are considered, and
that's not the way we have gone. We felt we wanted the
sportswriters to pick who is the most deserving candidates and we
take it from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Humphrey said they will explore dates that will not overlap with
other banquets.

 PLAYOFFS-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WITH three games remaining in the season, the NFC playoff
picture is not difficult to figure, but it takes a mathematician to
sort through the possibilities in the AFC.
</P>
<P>
   If everything goes as expected in the NFC, Minnesota and Atlanta
will get first-round byes. San Francisco will host Green Bay in one
wild-card game. Dallas will entertain the wild-card team with the
worst record.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona, Tampa Bay and New Orleans are competing for the last
wild-card spot in the NFC.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the AFC, take a deep breath. The only thing for certain
is that the undefeated Denver Broncos have earned the home-field
advantage and a first-round bye.
</P>
<P>
   The home advantage in the AFC hasn't meant much in the past
three years. Kansas City blew it in 1996 and 1998. Denver gave it
away in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville has a three-game lead in the AFC Central. If the
Jaguars win the division, as expected, they have the inside track
to getting a first-round bye and a second-round game at home.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a miracle, a big portion of the AFC will have to be
settled with tiebreakers.
</P>
<P>
   The AFC East, the most competitive division in the league, could
send four teams to the playoffs, a feat achieved only once in NFL
history. That happened last year when the NFC Central had Green
Bay, Tampa Bay, Minnesota and Detroit reach postseason play.
</P>
<P>
   Miami and the New York Jets are tied for first place in the AFC
East with 9-4 records. They play at Miami on Sunday night. New
England and Buffalo are 8-5.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets have made the playoffs once in 11 years. They should
have made it last season, but a bad call in the last game against
Detroit ruined their chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, there's more on the line now for all these teams,''
Jets coach Bill Parcells said. ``We were sitting here six weeks ago
talking about the exact same thing, and not much has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our division aside, some of the competition is not in as good
a position as they were in. Certainly, Pittsburgh (7-6) is not in
as good as position, and Tennessee (7-6) and Seattle (6-7) and
Kansas City (5-8). And Oakland (7-6) has certainly had a tough
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, some of the 10 teams we were competing with are in a lot
worse situation than us. That's the good news. The bad news is that
in our division, there's not much separation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos (13-0) are trying to join the 1972 Dolphins as the
only undefeated and untied champion. They are trying to become the
first 19-0 team. Because of their quest for perfection, the Broncos
have remained focused, unlike two years ago when they clinched
home-field advantage early, rested players and were shocked in the
second round by Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   At this stage of the season, the only teams that might even give
Denver and Minnesota trouble in the playoffs are Jacksonville in
the AFC and Atlanta or possibly San Francisco or Green Bay in the
NFC. Injuries have contributed to the 49ers and Packers
relinquishing their strangleholds on the NFC West and NFC Central
titles.
</P>
<P>
   AFC East
</P>
<P>
   The Jets, who are trying to make the playoffs for the first time
since 1991, won the first game against the Dolphins. A victory
Sunday would actually give New York, which has a 4-1 division
record, a two-game lead over Miami because of the head-to-head
tiebreaker. Last season, Parcells' first, the Jets lost three their
last four to finish 9-7 and miss the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' last three games are against the three division teams
competing for the playoffs. After visiting Miami and Buffalo, they
host New England.
</P>
<P>
   If you think the Jets' schedule is tough, check out Miami. The
Dolphins have the best defense in the league, but coach Jimmy
Johnson's conservative style has set offensive football back to the
'50s. After hosting the Jets, they entertain Denver and finish at
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are the hottest team in the division. They have a
three-game winning streak and games at St. Louis and the Jets
sandwiched around a home game against San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills have Doug Flutie, the miracle worker, at quarterback
and Eric Moulds, the hottest receiver in the league, to catch his
passes. The Bills host Oakland and the Jets and end at New Orleans.
All of their opponents are competing for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Keys &QC; 
 &UR; Coach &LR; : Jimmy Johnson, Dolphins. No one knows if he will take the
shackles off quarterback Dan Marino or continue to rely too heavily
on the running game and defense.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Player &LR; : Vinny Testaverde, Jets. A veteran quarterback with a
reputation for inconsistency down the stretch. He hasn't played in
many December games this important.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Question &LR; : Will Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe continue to
play better than any time in his six-year career and continue to
pull out last-minute victories despite a fractured index finger on
his throwing hand?
</P>
<P>
   AFC Central
</P>
<P>
   Barring a monumental collapse, the Jaguars are going to dethrone
the Steelers and win their first title. Pittsburgh's five-year
streak should end. The Jaguars better get a playoff game at home.
The last time they beat a winning team on the road was the 1997
second-round game at Denver, where they pulled the stunning upset.
</P>
<P>
   After hosting Tennessee this weekend, they travel to Minnesota
and end at home against Pittsburgh in the last Monday night game.
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers and Oilers have been disappointing. The Steelers
are capable of losing at Tampa Bay. After hosting Cincinnati, they
could crater in the finale against the Jaguars. The Oilers have the
most difficult schedule. They visit Jacksonville and Green Bay and
host Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Keys &QC;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Coach &LR; : Bill Cowher, Steelers. This is his seventh season, and
his team has never missed the playoffs. It will be a test of
Cowher's coaching and motivation to see if he can rally his team
over the last three games.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Player &LR; : Fred Taylor, Jaguars. The rookie running back has
scored 14 touchdowns and rushed for 1,005 yards despite nagging
injuries. With quarterback Mark Brunell nursing an ankle injury,
Taylor must take the pressure off backup Jamie Martin.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Question &LR; : How long will Jaguars quarterback Mark Brunell be
out? Coach Tom Coughlin wishes he knew.
</P>
<P>
   AFC West
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos, who won Super Bowl XXXII as a wild card, are trying
to win an NFL-record 19th consecutive game Sunday when they play a
road game against the Giants. Unless they suffer a colossal upset,
they will be 14-0 when they travel to Miami in the next game.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland looked as if it was going to make a serious run at the
playoffs, but the Raiders have lost three in a row. With road games
at Buffalo and San Diego and a home finale against the Chiefs, they
probably need to win out for a shot. Don't count on it.
</P>
<P>
   Keys &QC;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Coach &LR; : Mike Shanahan, Broncos. He must keep his players
focused on the Giants and not allow them to look ahead to the
Monday night game at Miami.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Player &LR; : John Elway, Broncos. The veteran quarterback has
thrown nine touchdown passes in his last three games and is healthy
for the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Question &LR; : If the Broncos beat the Giants, will they also win
at Miami in the most important regular-season game in years?
</P>
<P>
   NFC East
</P>
<P>
   Although the Cowboys are coming off one of the most embarrassing
losses in franchise history, only a total collapse would keep them
from winning the NFL's worst division.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule is easy. After playing at Kansas City, they host
Philadelphia and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona is woefully inconsistent. The Cardinals had the inside
track to the last wild-card spot and blew it with a home loss to
the Giants. If they had won, they would have trailed Dallas by one
game.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals also have an easy schedule. After visiting the
Eagles, they host the Saints and Chargers.
</P>
<P>
   Keys &QC;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Coach &LR; : Chan Gailey, Cowboys. He has to show he's not Barry
Switzer and keep the Cowboys from gagging down the stretch against
three disappointing teams.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Player &LR; : Jake Plummer, Cardinals. Arizona's quarterback is a
miracle worker or a disaster. The coaches just never know who is
going to show up: Jake Plummer or Jake the Snake.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Question &LR; : Will the Cardinals rally to win their first
non-strike playoff berth since 1975, and if they do, will they win
their first playoff game since 1947?
</P>
<P>
   NFC Central
</P>
<P>
   How the mighty hath fallen. The injury-plagued Packers are
reduced to a wild-card berth after reaching the last two Super
Bowls. The Vikings have dominated the division and earned a
first-round bye for the first time in coach Dennis Green's seven
years. They have a schedule so soft (at Baltimore, Jacksonville, at
Tennessee) they should finish 15-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers' skill-position players have spent more time in the
hospital than on the field, except for Brett Favre. There's good
news, though. They play two games against Chicago. Barring a
dramatic change, they will play the first-round game at San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   After shocking the Packers, Tampa Bay has vaulted back into
wild-card contention. If the Bucs can upset the Steelers at Tampa,
the last two on the road are against the Redskins and Bengals, two
of the league's worst teams.
</P>
<P>
   Keys &QC;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Coach &LR; : Dennis Green, Vikings. With one playoff victory in six
seasons, he must prove that he can win the big games in January.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Player &LR; : Brett Favre, Packers. Without healthy receivers, he
has to perform almost inhuman feats for his team to avoid a
first-round loss.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Question &LR; : Will Green Bay coach Mike Holmgren's job status
become such a distraction that the Packers make a quick exit from
the playoffs?
</P>
<P>
   NFC West
</P>
<P>
   There is a changing of the guard. Atlanta should win its second
division title and finish with the best record in franchise
history. The Falcons are expected to earn a second-round game at
the Georgia Dome. Although they have been very good, don't mark
them down for the division title yet. After road games against New
Orleans and Detroit, they finish at home against Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers can't believe they are going to be a wild-card team.
Thank heaven for an easy schedule because their defense is
mediocre. After hosting Detroit and traveling to New England, they
finish at home against St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints surprised Dallas to move into contention for the last
wild-card spot. Their schedule is brutal the last three weeks. They
host Atlanta, visit Arizona and entertain Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Keys &QC;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Coach &LR; : Mike Ditka, Saints. Without much talent and a lot of
injuries, his motivational skills are paramount if his team is
going to survive a schedule that has five of the last six against
teams with winning records.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Player &LR; : Chris Chandler, Falcons. If he stays healthy, they
have a chance to reach the NFC Championship Game. If he is injured,
they're dead.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Question &LR; : If the 49ers host a wild-card game against Green
Bay, will their defense be good enough to finally beat the Packers
in a playoff game?

 By TERRY BLOUNT  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
GRANBURY _ While speaking at the historic Granbury Opera House on
Thursday, Gene Stallings sounded like a man who wanted to make a
little more history coaching college football.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The former Alabama head coach said he met with Baylor officials
Wednesday and talked about the school's coaching job, which became
vacant Sunday when Dave Roberts was reassigned after back-to-back
2-9 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I visited with them (Baylor athletic director Tom Stanton and
Baylor president Robert Sloan),'' Stallings said. ``But they have a
number of people they want to talk to. That's basically where it
is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't made a decision one way or the other, and neither
have they.''
</P>
<P>
   But sources close to the program say the job is Stallings' if he
wants it. And for a man who said he hasn't made a decision,
Stallings sounded a lot like a man planning to take on a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said there are two things that could get me back in
coaching,'' Stallings said. ``One is if there was a team that I
thought was good enough to win the national championship. The other
is a team that needs help. Baylor needs some help. That's the
reason Baylor got my attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Stallings, 63, said he had followed Baylor closely this season
and attended two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were within a point or two of winning five or six
games,'' Stallings said. ``They were in the Texas game, the
Colorado game and the Texas Tech game. They just needed someone to
make a play or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``At any level of coaching, you win with players, not schemes.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanton said Thursday he expects to name a new head coach by the
end of next week. That would appear to fit Stallings' schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Stallings will be in Birmingham, Ala., today to take part in a
fund-raiser for the Stallings Center, a home for children with Down
syndrome. Stallings has a son with Down syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Stallings, who has a ranch in Paris, Texas, will return home
Sunday, then he will be in Washington from Monday through Thursday
participating in events for Special Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having dinner at the White House with the president
Thursday night for Special Olympics,'' Stallings said. ``Then, I'm
coming home on Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   The one problem for Baylor is that waiting another week would be
a big blow to recruiting, but sources said school officials are
willing to wait if it means getting Stallings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to do it as quickly as they can,'' Stallings said.
``By the same token, they want to make sure they get the person
that they want, but they can't wait too long. I would say they need
to do something within a week or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about getting back in touch. There's going to come a
time when they have to make a decision, and there's going to come a
time when I have to make a decision. But right now is not the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping the situation with Dave Roberts would work out.
I've been where is he right now, and I feel bad for him.''
</P>
<P>
   A source close to Stallings said he does not want to accept the
job too quickly, because he doesn't want it to look like it was a
done deal before Roberts was reassigned.
</P>
<P>
   Stallings, who retired at Alabama after the 1996 season, was in
Granbury on Thursday to announce plans for the USA World Cup
football team, which will train in Granbury this summer before
going to Palermo, Sicily, for the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Stallings is the head coach for the college all-star team, but
that could change if he takes the job at Baylor. NCAA rules say no
active coach can be involved with the World Cup team.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I retired, I said I was closing the chapter but I was not
closing the book,'' Stallings said. ``When I got involved with the
World Cup team, I told them there was a possibility that I might
coach again, either in the pros or in college. I know of two or
three people that would be very capable of taking over (the World
Cup team).''
</P>
<P>
   While Stallings was holding a news conference in Granbury,
Stanton was holding a hastily called news conference at Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton said he had talked to Stallings, along with Dallas
Highland Park coach Scott Smith, a former Baylor player and
assistant coach under Grant Teaff.
</P>
<P>
   Sources say Baylor is interested in Smith as a defensive
coordinator who could be groomed under Stallings. But Stallings
said he didn't know Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you really think they would tell me what coaches I had to
take?'' Stallings said. ``We didn't discuss (Smith), but we did
discuss some of the coaches that are there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like it's important that some of the coaches remain. I
think there are some good coaches there, and I think it's good to
have as much stability as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those coaches is Keith Gunn, Stallings' son-in-law. Gunn
coached tight ends this season. When asked if Gunn would be part of
the staff if he took the job, Stallings grinned and said, ``I would
say that would be a sure thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanton said he has other candidates he wants to interview. Two
of the names on Stanton's short list include Southern Mississippi
coach Jeff Bower and Arkansas defensive coordinator Keith Burns.
</P>
<P>
   Bower, the son-in-law of Florida State coach Bobby Bowden, is
reputed to be one of the best coaches in the country at molding
quarterbacks. He coached Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre.
</P>
<P>
   But Stallings is the top choice if he decides he wants to return
to coaching. Stallings was asked if he was flattered that Baylor
saw him as a man who could resurrect the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just because of my age,'' he said. ``I managed to go
through the pro game and the college game and still survive. If I
was looking for a coach, I would look for me, too. I make no
apologies about knowing something about coaching football.''

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
While the Astros wait to see if one highly coveted pitcher is
coming to town, they made sure another is staying.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shane Reynolds, whose name had been mentioned in trade talk
involving five-time Cy Young Award winner Roger Clemens, agreed
Thursday to a $21.5 million, three-year contract extension that
could keep him with the Astros through 2003.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the extension, the 30-year-old righthander has a
no-trade provision for the 1999 season and a limited no-trade
provision for the remainder of the contract, which includes a club
option for a fourth year.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the contract extension was casually discussed, this
literally happened in the last few days and accelerated,'' Astros
general manager Gerry Hunsicker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The no-trade (clause) was something they asked for. We had no
problem with that. In fact, we thought it was even more important
given the speculation out there that Shane was potentially part of
any discussions involving Roger Clemens _ to come out and put that
to rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds will make $3.5 million in 1999 in the final season of
an $8.5 million, three-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   Under the extension, he gets a $3.5 million signing bonus
payable over three years, and salaries of $5.5 million in 2000, $6
million in 2001 and $6.5 million in 2002. The Astros have an $8
million option for 2003 that would become guaranteed if Reynolds
makes 32 starts or pitches 215 innings in 2002, or has 64 starts
and 430 innings combined in 2001 and 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds would have been eligible for free agency after next
season. Instead of waiting to test the high-dollar market, he chose
to remain with the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not have another year and go for free agency with the way
the money is going?'' Reynolds said. ``Everybody wants to go to a
winner. I like it here. I've been with the Houston Astros
organization my whole career, and they have treated me fairly
throughout. They are the ones to give me the chance to succeed, and
they've been very loyal, and I think I've been loyal to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, I can finish my career here. I think the Astros
have done their part to make that possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm worth exactly what I got here _ no more, no
less, because it's where I wanted to be. They wanted me. That was
very important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds battled back from 1997 knee surgery to go 19-8 with a
3.51 ERA as the Astros repeated as National League Central
champions in 1998. The 19 wins were a career high for Reynolds _
his previous high was 16 in 1996 _ and tied for second in the NL
with Chicago's Kevin Tapani.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Tom Glavine, the Cy Young Award winner, led the league
with 20 wins.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds also tied for the league lead in starts (35) and ranked
in the top 10 in winning percentage (.704), innings pitched (233),
strikeouts (209), strikeouts per nine innings (8.06) and fewest
walks per nine innings (2.04).
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the best-kept secrets in major-league baseball,''
Hunsicker said. ``Shane has been one of the anchors of our staff
over the last four years and, over that four-year period, is among
the most consistent starting pitchers in all of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at all the important statistical categories that
evaluate starting pitchers, I think you'll find Shane's name in
most of those lists. In each of the last three years, he has been
our opening-day starting pitcher. That is further evidence of what
he means to this franchise and our baseball team.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Reynolds became the first three-year veteran ever
guaranteed a multiyear contract by the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a relatively easy contract to do,'' said the
pitcher's agent, Tommy Tanzer. ``The club was very motivated. We
were very motivated. After some of the departures they had, they
stepped up. This got done in three or four conversations.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds said the rush to complete a deal was mostly because he
wanted to remain a part of a contending club, although speculation
of his possible departure played a small role.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros remain a contender for Clemens, who has asked the
Toronto Blue Jays to trade him to a contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this organization, a lot of ballplayers and this city
would love to have Roger,'' said Reynolds. ``I didn't want it to be
at my expense. You just don't ever know. That's another reason this
was a case for me to sign this deal, to kind of know I'm here and
have the stability.
</P>
<P>
   ``In baseball, you're here one year and gone the next. When you
find a club you really like _ and like the people and management _
you'll pretty much do whatever you can to stay. Seeing my name
(among trade rumors) is something you have to go through being an
athlete these days.''

</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THE Astros deserve extra points for not trying to be coy. They told
us straight up, before the fact, that their hastily called
Thursday-afternoon news conference concerned only Shane Reynolds,
not Roger Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, some of us felt let down. But that didn't mean the
announcement of a three-year contract extension for Reynolds,
currently the Astros' ace, was a trivial development.
</P>
<P>
   With Randy Johnson come and gone and Clemens still a mere
Christmas wish _ albeit one tantamount to that new pony _ Reynolds
is, until further notice, The Man. You want to keep him happy. And
happy Shane should be, even if he didn't squeeze every nickel out
of a free-spending system that he might have after winning 19 games
last season.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds got security. The Astros also got security, with just a
modicum of risk.
</P>
<P>
   Although they are now on the hook to Shane for an additional
$21.5 million, the club has every reason to believe he will do
whatever is humanly possible to earn the sum total of the windfall.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Reynolds appears to have no latent Mark Portugal or
Greg Swindell tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   While that's a lot of money to guarantee a pitcher, and
organizational policy frowns on such largess, Reynolds' file
indicates he's a worthy recipient of such faith being shown in him.
</P>
<P>
   He's young _ 31 on opening day _ a clean liver and a hard
worker. He's also pretty darn good. General manager Gerry Hunsicker
is wont to point out that Shane had more ``quality'' starts in 1998
than either Johnson or Clemens. Look it up, Hunsicker says.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off knee surgery in 1997, Reynolds bowed his back and
recovered 100 percent, winding up tied for the league lead in
starts and ranking in the top 10 in five major statistical
categories. Only Cy Young Award winner Tom Glavine won more games
(20).
</P>
<P>
   If Johnson hadn't so thoroughly dominated National League
hitters, never mind local conversation, and then Clemens' name
hadn't taken over the airwaves and sports pages of late, the news
that Shane will be sticking around through at least 2003 would be
enough to make most people sing and dance.
</P>
<P>
   But, no, we want more. Of course we do. We've gotta have the
Rocket.
</P>
<P>
   Shane's OK with this, actually. He wants the Rocket, too. That's
another of Reynolds' assets: His ego is completely in check,
unfortunately a rarity for a player of his growing stature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm for anything that helps us win,'' he said. He called
Clemens ``a friend'' and admitted he would love to locker next to
him. Should the five-time Cy Young Award winner assume the Astros'
``ace'' designation, so what? And so be it. Spahn and Sain had each
other, didn't they?
</P>
<P>
   ```Ace,''' Reynolds said, ``is an iffy term.''
</P>
<P>
   Re-upping Reynolds before he had a chance to seek greener
pastures _ and giving him a ``no-trade'' contract _ removes Shane's
name from speculation he might be part of whatever Astros package
for Clemens may be on the table.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the terms of the extension were hammered out extra
fast, seemingly out of the blue, although player and management say
the conversations had begun well before Toronto agreed to set the
Rocket free for the right price.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding same, the Astros have made it clear what they will and
won't do. Obviously, Shane was an untouchable, as are the other
usual suspects _ Craig Biggio, Jeff Bagwell and Moises Alou. With
Reynolds now locked up, the club doesn't feel _ internally, at
least _ any great pressure to jam a Clemens trade through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very comfortable with the pitching staff we have,''
Hunsicker said. ``Even when you subtract Randy's numbers, ours was
one of the best in the league last year. We don't need to rip the
ballclub apart to improve it.''
</P>
<P>
   As badly as the customers may want Clemens wearing a blue cap
with a gold star, the Astros will proceed cautiously. As they
should, no matter how tantalizing the Rocket's return to his
hometown may be _ or whatever ``mystery'' teams covet Clemens' Hall
of Fame arm.
</P>
<P>
   Too many three-for-one deals, and suddenly you have zero depth.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, the payoff on Johnson was, ultimately, negligible. The
Astros advanced no further with him than they had gone the previous
year without him. And, ironically, one of the players they sent to
Seattle, Carlos Guillen, might have helped with their Clemens
quest.
</P>
<P>
   Guillen is expected to start at second for the Mariners in 1999,
and, more than anything, the Blue Jays covet a second baseman.
</P>
<P>
   Right, hindsight. Let's not go there.
</P>
<P>
   Having the Big Unit was a gas, just as having Rocket Roger would
be. But Reynolds _ you hardly need a nickname when your real name
is Shane _ remains a comforting presence. He deserves to be
celebrated on his own merit.
</P>
<P>
   Shane's best seasons are surely ahead of him. Who could think
that about the other guys?

</P>
<P>
   Internationals &QL; 
ahead 7-3 in &QL; 
Presidents Cup
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
MELBOURNE, Australia _ Jack Nicklaus said he didn't want a war.
Good thing, since his American team isn't putting up much of a
fight after the first day of the Presidents Cup. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the American team is going to stay undefeated in this event,
it will have to do it in come-from-behind fashion thanks to a Kiwi
invasion on Day 1.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealander Frank Nobilo fired a shot through the Americans'
collective heart with a 40-foot putt on No. 18 at Royal Melbourne
to win a critical foursome match as the International team stormed
to a commanding lead today (Thursday).
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the International team is getting the hang of this
format. In the first Presidents Cup in 1994, it was hammered 5-0 in
the first morning's matches and the Americans went on to win the
Cup in a breeze. Two years ago, the Americans led 3-2 after the
first morning's matches and that ended up being the margin by which
they kept the Cup, winning 16{-15{.
</P>
<P>
   But the International team got through the morning foursome
matches ahead 3{-1{, and there was no doubt that the International
players sensed they had a breakthrough performance in the
alternate-shot matches. Their play in the morning set the tone for
a grand day at the end of which they led 7-3, putting the U.S. in a
big hole.
</P>
<P>
   There will be 10 more points at stake Saturday (today) in
foursome and fourball matches, with 16{ points needed for victory.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the momentum is with the International team after the
way it dismantled the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our effort is about 100 percent better than it was in the
previous Presidents Cups,'' International captain Peter Thomson
said. ``I'm very pleased with my team.''
</P>
<P>
   And his team should be well-pleased with Thomson. It was his
call to place Nobilo and fellow New Zealander Greg Turner as the
final two members of the International team. They rewarded that
decision by beating Mark O'Meara and David Duval when it appeared
the match was heading for a halve.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. side was one hole down going into the par-4 18th. But
when O'Meara hit a wedge to within three feet and Turner's approach
left Nobilo with a 40-footer from the fringe, the Americans'
chances seemed great.
</P>
<P>
   But Nobilo smoothly sank the long birdie putt, rendering Duval's
tap-in moot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hole just sucked it in,'' Nobilo said. ``It was great.
Peter was determined to get off to a good start this time. And it
feels good to be ahead in this thing for a change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing with Kiwis is we will nip at someone's heels all day
for 18 holes and eventually we will take the leg off.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara said he wasn't crestfallen when Nobilo's putt rattled
in. But it clearly was a jolt to the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I hit my wedge up there, I told David to just go ahead
and roll it in,'' O'Meara said. ``But in the back of my mind, I
thought Frank might make that 40-footer. In this format, you never
underestimate your opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Americans weren't already keenly respectful of the
Internationals, they are now.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Norman was a question mark coming into the match with
barely a month under his belt since returning from shoulder
surgery. But he held up nicely. He teamed with Steve Elkington for
a solid win over Jim Furyk and John Huston in the morning, then was
with Elkington again in the afternoon against Furyk and O'Meara.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody was doubting Norman's stamina after he and Elkington won
the afternoon battle 3 and 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever he's available, I need him,'' Thomson said. ``He
doesn't want to be rested.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman credited Nobilo's putt for stoking up the International
team. ``You look at something like that, those are the types of
things that filter all the way down the team,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Only Fred Couples and Tiger Woods were able to win their morning
match for the U.S., smashing Ernie Els and Vijay Singh 5 and 4. The
Couples-Woods combination proved to be the only highlight as the
teams continued play with five fourball matches in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger was putting so well today, which is very important,''
Couples said. ``I didn't have to putt too much.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to their match came on No. 8, when they had to take an
unplayable lie after Woods' errant tee shot. But Couples' approach
cozied up to within eight feet and Woods drilled the putt, earning
a half on the hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight was huge,'' Woods said. ``It really got us pumped. Then
we made another one on nine. From there, we ham-and-egged it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the rest of the American team mostly just egged it.
</P>
<P>
   It took a marvelous approach shot by Justin Leonard on No. 18,
and an eight-foot birdie putt by partner Davis Love III, to get a
split with Stuart Appleby and Nick Price in the morning's final
match. The half-point kept the Americans from falling into a 4-1
hole.
</P>
<P>
   Couples had problems in the afternoon match, however. He and
Love, a strong tandem in Ryder Cup competitions, lost Nos. 6 and 7
when neither could make a par.
</P>
<P>
   It was that kind of day for the Americans. Not much went right.
</P>
<P>
   There were two gripping subplots. Foremost, the wind did a
U-turn and was whipping out of the north at about 20 mph. That
drove temperatures up beyond the 95-degree mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time the wind comes out of that direction, it's like a
furnace,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   More bothersome than the heat, however, was the fact that the
course played completely different than it had in three days of
practice when the wind was coming out of the south and west. The
International players said their experiences in past trips to Royal
Melbourne helped them adjust to the different conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're up against a great team like we are, you need
something to go in your favor,'' Nobilo said. ``The conditions were
really good for us.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the International team members credited Thomson for
giving them their first-day pairings well in advance so they could
practice together. The International players knew two full days
ahead of time what the alternate-shot pairings would be for their
side. The American team requested similar information from Nicklaus
in a team meeting Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, some U.S. players weren't happy about being kept in
the dark about with whom they would be playing in the difficult
format. Nicklaus dismissed any notion that there were problems.

CALIFORNIA REPRESENTATIVE EMBITTERED BY HOUSE HEARINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By LOUIS FREEDBERG  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    WASHINGTON _ When Congress began its impeachment inquiry three
months ago, Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., dug up her copy of the
Federalist Papers and began brushing up on her constitutional
history.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The San Jose Democrat hoped the House Judiciary Committee's
inquiry would be rooted in constitutional principles and clearly
establish whether President Clinton's behavior met the standards
for ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' set by the Founding Fathers.
Unlike many other Democrats, she refused to attack independent
counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Now, on the eve of a historic impeachment vote, Lofgren, the
only Bay Area lawmaker on the panel, has become disgusted with a
process she calls a ``national embarrassment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sad day in our nation's history,'' she said Thursday
night in explaining to the committee why she will vote against
articles of impeachment. ``Unfortunately, it seems to be one more
day in a long, sad season.''
</P>
<P>
   Lofgren's descent into disillusionment illuminates why these
hearings, unlike the Watergate inquiry a quarter-century earlier,
are likely to end with a vote to impeach Clinton along strictly
party lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they (the Republicans) had come up with a case that the
president engaged in behavior that threatens our constitutional
form of government, he would be in trouble with me,'' she said in
an interview. ``But you can't afford to cause this kind of
disruption over which body parts he touched. I am sorry, that is
not what George Mason had in mind.'' Mason was one of the framers
of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The glamour of media exposure has long been eroded by long hours
away from family, endless discussions of familiar arguments and the
tawdriness of much of the testimony. During a recent hearing, while
her colleagues droned on in front of TV cameras, Lofgren took a
quick break in the cramped two rooms reserved for Democrats next to
the hearing room. In lieu of dinner, she munched on an ice cream
sandwich from a nearly empty vending machine.
</P>
<P>
   The rooms were littered with Coke cans and newspapers, as
lawmakers and staffers milled around or squeezed onto two black
leather couches.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because these hearings have not lasted nearly as long as
the Watergate inquiry 24 years ago, no committee members have
emerged as recognizable stars in the mold of Barbara Jordan, the
late representative from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But Lofgren has made her mark as one of the more measured
lawmakers who consistently asks deeper questions about what the
Founding Fathers had in mind when they drafted articles of
impeachment two centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   She was also the first member to talk about the potential
long-term harm of voting to impeach Clinton, which would require a
trial in the Senate that would be presided over by Chief Justice
William Rehnquist.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do this trial, does that mean the Supreme Court does not
get to hear any cases for a period of six months or more?'' she
asked at a hearing this week. ``Is all of government gridlocked?''
</P>
<P>
   She also recounted how several Silicon Valley executives had
expressed concerns that a long trial could have a depressing effect
on the U.S. economy, the first time anyone had raised that
prospect.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Katzenbach, a former U.S. attorney general and IBM
chief executive, agreed that that was not a farfetched concept.
``People in business want certainty, and I can think of nothing
much worse than pushing them into an uncertainty that would go on
for some period of time while we rehearsed what has been rehearsed
a dozen times already,'' Katzenbach testified this week as part of
Clinton's defense.
</P>
<P>
   Lofgren has been able to make her own unfavorable comparisons
with the Watergate hearings. As a first-year law student, she
helped draft articles of impeachment against President Richard
Nixon while serving as an aide to then-Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Watergate, there was a very heavy sense of foreboding and
gravity, which isn't present here,'' she said. ``It was widely
perceived as a committee coming together in the face a national
cataclysmic threat. This time, it is one party going after the
president of another.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans, she said, are trying to get back at Democrats
for what they did to Nixon. ``It doesn't seem possible that some
people would be trying to get even, but as astounding as that may
seem, there are people doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   What disturbs Lofgren is that many of her constituents back home
wrongly believed that after the Republican setbacks in the November
elections the impeachment hearings would soon be over.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to get ready for the holidays, and most people
are not at home watching this stuff,'' she said. ``I'm not critical
of that. But I think a lot of people will be upset, shocked and
surprised when they wake up to find that we have voted to impeach
the president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Lofgren is also struggling with how to balance her family
responsibilities with those of being in office at one of the most
dramatic moments in U.S. history. Her husband, attorney John
Collins, and her two teenage children are back home in San Jose.
She's relieved she was able to pick out the family Christmas tree
before the impeachment marathon began and put up the trimmings.
</P>
<P>
   But she is way behind on her holiday shopping. During one break
in the hearings, she dashed across the street to the House gift
shop to buy souvenirs for some friends, but she has exhausted her
shopping possibilities there. ``I'm hoping they'll take a mall
break,'' she quipped.
</P>

 &HT;    Once again, tripping the light fantastic
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ I am trying hard to get into the Christmas
spirit. The warm weather isn't helping. It's hard to sing along
with Christmas carols while wearing shorts and running the air
conditioner. It's the Yankee in me that wants snow this time of
year, at least for a week or so.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, I did two things: went to church, where the service
concluded with a rousing, five-stanza rendition of ``The Battle
Hymn of the Republic,'' which is one of my favorite hymns, and
strung Christmas lights. It's a good thing I went to church first.
Or maybe I should have gone back afterward. Stringing Christmas
lights can make a man forget his religion in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Opening the crate of lights sent my heart sinking like an
Aggie's spirits after The Game last week. (Sorry, I had to get in a
dig somewhere.) We bought new lights this year. The old lights had
tangled themselves into a wire-and-glass hairball that I refused to
deal with. I gave them to Goodwill. No doubt, workers there have
been hard at it since summer trying to untangle the lights so they
could be resold.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) Vacate the premises immediately. (end ital) That
was my first thought upon viewing this massive collection of
lights. Go missing in action. Come back after New Year's. Hanging
these lights, all 16 cartons of them, was going to be the death of
me. I was sure of that.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly who invented this tradition of hanging lights? And how
in the world do people who put up those incredible displays have
the patience to do this year in, year out? I looked in dismay at
the many boxes of icicle lights, all the rage these days. They hang
down and allegedly look like icicles. I believe my wife purposely
bought the most complicated set of lights in America. I accused her
of shopping for weeks just to find a set of lights that a NASA
engineer would be hard-put to figure out. She denied it, of course
and left town, leaving me alone to hang the lights while hanging
from the roof. I should mention that she has a large life-insurance
policy on me.
</P>
<P>
   Yeech. I opened the first box and took out a bag containing
about 40 pieces of plastic and two sets of lights. It took about 20
minutes to figure out how to put it together. At this rate, the
lights would be up just in time for Valentine's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, things had to get better, particularly my mood. So I
went inside and brought out the jambox. Maybe a little music would
help.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the first song I heard was that horrible version
of ``Jingle Bells'' sung by dogs barking. The cats, who had
wandered out on the second-story porch with me, looked alarmed. I
switched stations.
</P>
<P>
   Click. The next set went together in just 5 minutes. Things were
improving. Now it was time to actually hang a set and see how it
looked.
</P>
<P>
   Here came the tricky part. I had to reach out backwards over the
porch rail and screw a cup hook into the wood to hold the lights.
If I fell, at best I would break something and be out of the
hospital in time to open presents. At worst... well, let's not get
into that.
</P>
<P>
   Englebert Humperdink came on the radio, singing something or
other. In my haste to switch off the dogs and ``Jingle Bells,'' I
had ended up on an easy-listening station. Even worse, I had been
listening for about 15 minutes without noticing. My rock 'n' roll
image was in jeopardy. Quickly I put it on the Oldies Rock station.
</P>
<P>
   Right after I got the first set hung, I went down to check out
my handiwork. By the time I got outside and was looking up, one set
of lights had quit burning. I hurried upstairs and began checking
bulbs, replacing fuses, etc. Nothing worked. The lights would not
come on.
</P>
<P>
   Yuletide spirit was sorely lacking as I took down the second set
of lights and put together yet another set to replace the defective
ones. I was grumbling mightily under my breath.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, things got better. Eventually, I got the hang of
hanging the lights. In a fit of stupidity, I even climbed up on the
roof and hung some from a steep-pitched gable, leaning over the
side and hoping fervently I didn't end up impaled in the azaleas in
the ground below.
</P>
<P>
   By dark all the lights were shining. They don't exactly look
like icicles. More like popsicle sticks with lights on them.

 &HT;    Books make long-lasting holiday gifts
 &HT;    By Jay Milner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that December is upon us again, although it hasn't been all
that noticeable as far as the weather is concerned, why not think
about giving books for Christmas gifts?
</P>
<P>
   There's very little else you can give that would last as long
and give as much pleasure, unless you're thinking about diamonds or
something in that category, and, if so, you might consider giving a
whole library.
</P>
<P>
   But for most of us a single book would be a lasting and
worthwhile Christmas gift, especially for, well, for just about
anybody you care about.
</P>
<P>
   If you need some suggestions, how about these:
</P>
<P>
   ``Cold Mountain'' by Charles Frazier (Atlantic Monthly Press).
</P>
<P>
   It's particularly pleasant when a book we love becomes a best
seller without a lot of hype. ``Cold Mountain'' is such a book.
It's Frazier's first novel and publishers more often than not send
first novels out without expensive artificial legs, then nod and
say, ``I knew it wouldn't sell'' when it sinks without creating a
stir on its own.
</P>
<P>
   But now and then, a book will cause an uproar and wind up a best
seller on its own, by word of mouth mostly, although a few sensible
critics may help it along with rave reviews. ``Cold Mountain'' was
raved about by critics and readers alike, and gradually became a
best-seller without the expensive hype. And it's worth it, one of
the best novels I've read in a long time.
</P>
<P>
   It's an absorbing story with characters that are real and
sympathetic. Set during the closing months of the Civil War, it
follows a Confederate deserter's trek back home were his wife is
waiting and living her own adventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Patchwork Planet'' by Anne Tyler (Knopf).
</P>
<P>
   I'm one of the many people who greet every new Anne Tyler novel
with a joyful noise. So far I haven't been disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Any lover of good books would be happy to receive this, or any
Anne Tyler book for that matter, as a Christmas gift. (Most of her
others are in paperback.)
</P>
<P>
   Plots aren't the most important aspects of a Tyler book. Oh,
there's always a good story that keeps you interested in the
outcome, but it's the characters and the writing that make Tyler
stand out.
</P>
<P>
   In ``A Patchwork Planet'' the main character is Barnaby Gaitlin,
who earns a living in an unusual manner. Here's the way he explains
his job: ``The company I work for is called 'Rent-a-Back.' How I
got into it is a whole other story, but basically we provide a
service for people who are old or disabled. Any load you can't
lift, any chore you don't feel up to, why just call us.''
</P>
<P>
   As Barnaby goes about his work for various elderly and disabled
men and women, he becomes involved in their lives because that's
the kind of guy he is. He even grows attached to the grumpy ones.
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times reviewer wrote the following about another
Tyler book, words that could be applied to this new one or any
other Tyler book. ``Tyler does nothing fancy, nothing tricky. But
so rigorous and artful is the style, so measured and delicate is
each observation, so complete is the structure and so astute and
open the language, that the reader can relax, feel secure in the
narrative and experience the work as something real and natural _
even inevitable _ the story that appears to unfold of its own
accord is a fairy tale of sorts, a fairy tale with echoes of both
the tragedy of King Lear and the absurdity of the modern romance
novel.'' She took the words right out of my word processor.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the latest novel by El Paso writer Cormac McCarthy,
``Cities of the Plain'' (Knopf).
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy is called by some ``the Texas Faulkner,'' and there may
be some legitimate cause for this, although I'm not sure I go for
it 100 percent. I will go along part way on that, which means that
in my mind he is something special as far as contemporary writers
in America are concerned. This latest book of McCarthy's is the
third in his ``Border Trilogy.'' The other two are ``All the Pretty
Horses'' and ``The Crossing.'' Any one or all three of these would
be fine Christmas gifts for a serious reader. I emphasize the
``serious'' here because these are not light reading by any means,
but worth the effort by any measure.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of heavy reading ... well, not so heavy you'll have
trouble getting
</P>
<P>
   through it and understanding it. The author here is straight
forward and easy to understand, but the subject is heavy. I'm
talking about David Halberstam's newest best seller, ``The
Children'' (Random House, 783 pp., including the index, $29.95).
</P>
<P>
   This is the detailed history of eight young black college
students, who in the 1960s, found themselves propelled into the
leadership of the civil rights movement (to quote from the book
jacket) as the movement and America entered a period of dramatic
change. Halberstam, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter and author,
was working on the Nashville Banner when this movement
</P>
<P>
   began, a 25-year-old reporter assigned to cover this story.
</P>
<P>
   Like all Halberstam's books, this one has received rave reviews
from coast to coast. It would make a great Christmas gift to people
who would appreciate it.
</P>
<P>
   All these books are keepers for now and future generations to
read and enjoy and learn.
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, there's that brand new book ``Confessions of a
Mad Dog.'' (University of North Texas Press) by that fellow Jay
Dunston Milner. It would make a fine Christmas gift for any friend
or family member who is interested in Texas writers of song and
story, such as Willie Nelson, Bud Shrake, Dan Jenkins, Gary
Cartwright and others of that ilk, who in the 1960s formed a sort
of social and literary club called Mad Dog, Inc., with the motto,
``Doing indefinable services to mankind.''
</P>
<P>
   I've read it and it is indeed funny and informative. We're
trying to cast
</P>
<P>
   the movie version now.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Milner, who can be reached at jpownall(at)coxnews.com,
writes for Cox Newspapers and unabashedly promotes his own book.

 &HT;    Would-be Santa sues company for racial bias
 &HT;    By Cara Tanamachi
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ For years, DeWayne Lofton has been dressing up
as Santa Claus around the holidays to amuse family and friends. So
when a friend suggested he take his Santa suit and apply for a job
at the mall this winter, the 32-year-old state employee thought:
Why not?
</P>
<P>
   Lofton, who is black, said he never thought his race would be an
issue. That is, until he arrived in person to apply for a job with
Santa Plus, a St. Louis-based company that contracts with local
malls to fill Santa positions. He said he was met with surprised
stares and told about a policy against hiring minorities to play
Santa.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Plus representatives say that they have no such policy and
that they hired Lofton, but that he failed to show up for his
training session.
</P>
<P>
   Lofton said he showed up for training only to be told he didn't
have a Santa job.
</P>
<P>
   It will be up to a Travis County jury to decide the facts. This
week, Lofton filed a lawsuit in District Court in Austin against
Santa Plus and Barton Creek Square, where he sought employment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought that Christmas was for all children in Travis
County,'' said Lofton's attorney, John W. Thomas, who filed the
lawsuit Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Lents, a spokeswoman for Santa Plus, said the company
doesn't discriminate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take our hiring practices very seriously,'' Lents said.
``Santa Plus has great integrity in everything we do.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Santa Plus has minority Santas working at malls across
Texas, including one black and one Hispanic Santa working at Barton
Creek.
</P>
<P>
   A black Santa was hired through a temp service for Barton Creek
Square but was not scheduled to work this week, or any time in
December, according to Ida Funes, a Santa Plus manager at the mall.
Funes said they use Santas from temp services when they do not have
enough Santas to fill their time slots. The Santas directly hired
by Santa Plus have set schedules, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hispanic Santa was working Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   In November, according to Lofton's lawsuit, he called Santa
Plus, which has contracts with Barton Creek Square and Lakeline
Mall, and was told they were desperate for Santa applicants. But
after he arrived at Barton Creek Square to meet a Santa Plus
representative, Lofton said a Santa Plus manager told him: ``When I
spoke to you over the phone, I did not realize that you were black.
I'll have to check with the mall to see if it would be OK to hire,
you know.'' The manager was not named in the lawsuit, and Thomas
said she is no longer with the company.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lofton's lawsuit, the Santa Plus manager said the
mall had a policy of not hiring minorities for Santas. The jobs
typically pay between $7 and $7.50 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Hedrick, manager of Barton Creek Square, said the mall has
no such policy and does not request Santas of a particular race.
Further, the mall has no control over hiring policies at Santa
Plus, which it treats like any other vendor at the mall who rents
space, Hedrick said.
</P>
<P>
   Hedrick said she had never heard of any problems with Santa Plus
before Lofton's lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say that Santa Plus is very well-respected in the
industry as professionals,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lofton's allegations will likely be difficult to prove, an
employment discrimination specialist said. Jack Getman, a law
professor at the University of Texas who has no part in the case,
said there are dozens of reasons a company might not hire a Santa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, you cannot get away today saying that Santa Claus
has to be white,'' he said. ``But employment discrimination is
often hard to prove. While some employer may have had race in the
back of their mind, it's relatively easy to pick out a nonracial
basis for the decision. Maybe you're not affable enough, or you
don't get along well with children, or your laugh doesn't sound
right. This is an acting job, and it depends on who well you act
the role.''
</P>
<P>
   Lents said Santa Plus looks for three things in would-be Santas:
a clear voice, smiling eyes and gentleness. Lofton, she said, met
those requirements and was hired to work as a Santa at Barton Creek
Square, but didn't show up for his training or his first scheduled
shift, which Lents said was Dec. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Lofton agrees that he was promised a job after he complained
about his initial treatment. He said in his lawsuit that a senior
Santa Plus manager said he could work as a cashier at the Santa
exhibit with the understanding that he would be rotated into one of
the four-hour Santa shifts later in the month. But according to his
lawsuit, when Lofton arrived for training on Dec. 3, he was told by
the on-site Santa Plus manager, who also is not named in the
lawsuit, that he did not have a job or an application on file.
</P>
<P>
   Lofton said his lawsuit, which claims breach of contract among
other allegations, is not about money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is about obtaining justice,'' he said. ``I will leave the
damages up to the jury to decide after they determine the facts.''

 &HT;    No visions of dancing sugar plums but . . .
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ 'Twas the night before Christmas, and in
Bubbaland,
</P>
<P>
   Folks were so giddy they should hire a band.
</P>
<P>
   The reason South Congress folks were feeling the best?
</P>
<P>
   After years of great struggle, they'd shut Cinema West.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if they'd been freed from a gigantic hex.
</P>
<P>
   No more weirdos in trench coats, no more films rated X.
</P>
<P>
   No more hookers on corners, dressed in hot pants.
</P>
<P>
   No stray lawmakers asking, ``May I have this dance?''
</P>
<P>
   No more drunks at the bus stop sucking down wine.
</P>
<P>
   No more senators asking, ``Your place or mine?''
</P>
<P>
   And how 'bout that road work at I-35 and Ben White?
</P>
<P>
   Until that job's finished, just forget ``Silent Night.''
</P>
<P>
   We'll have a new airport; there'll be lots of jets there.
</P>
<P>
   But with all that construction, you'll play hell to get there.
</P>
<P>
   To reach the new airport, here's my advice:
</P>
<P>
   Just pull down your britches and slide on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, up at the Capitol, state reps were aglow.
</P>
<P>
   From the mayor of Austin they got gift globes of snow.
</P>
<P>
   And not just those cheap globes like you find on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Hey. These snow globes from Saks were the tops in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   And if that wasn't enough to find under their tree,
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said state reps could park _ for free.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why such a great freebie?'' you're asking yourself.
</P>
<P>
   It's 'cause Mayor Kirk Watson is one crafty elf.
</P>
<P>
   He knows if he brown-noses the state Senate and House,
</P>
<P>
   In the coming session, they won't treat him like a louse.
</P>
<P>
   So next time you're downtown and can't find a space,
</P>
<P>
   Track down Mayor Watson and get in his face.
</P>
<P>
   At the university known far and wide as UT,
</P>
<P>
   Football fans were quite happy; there were whoops of great glee.
</P>
<P>
   What had all those Orange Bloods acting so dopey?
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Williams would soon get his own Heisman Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   And not only that _ that was just the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   The team has a defense and is actually winning.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the season before had been a debacle.
</P>
<P>
   But since then, the players have been taught how to tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at the Mansion, George W. Bush was in a bind.
</P>
<P>
   'Cause soon he would have to make up his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Should he hang onto his job as Texas' chief resident?
</P>
<P>
   Or should he throw in his hat and run for president?
</P>
<P>
   Should he go for the big one and face all that scrutiny?
</P>
<P>
   And if he did, would it cause his wife Laura to mutiny?
</P>
<P>
   A decision would have to be made fairly fast.
</P>
<P>
   But if he runs, the media will scour his past.
</P>
<P>
   And Lord knows they'll find stuff, like his remark about Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Hey. The press will report it whenever he sneezes.
</P>
<P>
   In the halls of the Capitol, the people were grieving;
</P>
<P>
   After decades of leadership, Bob Bullock was leaving.
</P>
<P>
   This caused one huge problem for the pols to unravel.
</P>
<P>
   When Bullock walks off, who gets the gavel?
</P>
<P>
   And without him around to tell folks what to do,
</P>
<P>
   Is there anyone left who can tie his own shoe?
</P>
<P>
   It's a question that leaves us all quaking in fright, but
</P>
<P>
   Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night.

 &HT;    Interview with Gene Simmons from the rock group Kiss
 &HT;    By Carol Simmons
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Failure. Doubt. Indecision.
</P>
<P>
   Don't even talk about it. At least not to Gene Simmons, founding
member and bass player for the most theatrical band in rock history
_ Kiss.
</P>
<P>
   Negativity has no place. At least not in his worldview. It's
ludicrous, it's preposterous and just down right dumb.
</P>
<P>
   And Simmons, currently on tour with the band that 25 years after
its forming in New York City continues to astound fans and confound
critics, says he'll have none of it.
</P>
<P>
   That's not how you succeed. And Simmons is a winner. With the
kind of focus, drive and confidence that might have found him work
as a motivational speaker if he hadn't gone into the music
business, Simmons preaches a gospel of personal responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The man who prowls the stage in a costume that's part-dragon,
part-demon, spitting fake blood and real fire and licking the air
with a tongue renowned for its unnatural length has no patience for
whiners. You want something, you work for it. No excuses.
</P>
<P>
   Born Gene Klein 49 years ago in Israel, the musician said his
family moved to the United States when he was 9. Speaking earlier
this week from the Ritz Carlton in Chicago _ in advance of a
concert tonight at Wright State University _ the performer said he
took the name Simmons simply because he liked it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no rhyme or reason for it,'' he said. ``When I heard
it in my head, I said that's me. I go through life that way. When I
come across images and things, I just absorb it, and it feels
right.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he added, the name you're given at birth isn't really yours
anyway. It's not your choice, and it's not based on your own
understanding of yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Naming himself was just one piece in a lifetime of personal
self-invention. But Simmons thinks everybody goes through the same
invention process to some degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all born to a clean slate, and what we do to it is our
choice,'' he said. ``You are responsible for yourself. Mommy's not
there to wipe your (bottom). Literally. You have to do it yourself.
If you don't, I don't care. You have to live with the
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Self-pity drives him nuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '80s, this horrific disease came out of Seattle,'' he
said referring to the grunge and alternative-music scene. ``Not the
music itself. There was some very fine music. The disease was of
self-loathing and apathy.''
</P>
<P>
   And from his viewpoint, it looked like the negativity and
depression was coming out of a pretty privileged population. ``It's
always in the white community,'' he noted. ``Some blond, blue-eyed
boy complaining about his life. You never hear a black person
standing on a roof talking about suicide.'' They may be angry, but
they're not whining.
</P>
<P>
   ``How believable is it for you to whine and moan about how hard
life is, especially when you're a rock star.'' You have fame and
fortune, he said. ``The girls all want to have your babies. If you
have any amount of discomfort with the money, send it to Gene
Simmons. I have no problem with it.''
</P>
<P>
   But while a certain depressed attitude was in vogue for a time,
Simmons said it really was only a ``lunatic fringe,'' and now it's
dead.
</P>
<P>
   Kiss, however, is still going strong. Although the original
lineup of Simmons, guitarist Paul Stanley, guitarist Ace Frehley
and drummer Peter Criss has only been back together for two years _
after Frehly and Criss broke off in the early 1980s _ Kiss never
stopped touring and recording. The latest album, Psycho Circus,
which was released this fall, is the band's 31st or 32nd (Simmons
isn't sure), including European releases, but it's the first album
in 20 years featuring all four original members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kiss, we're like cockroaches,'' Simmons said ``We've been here
before all of you, and we'll outlive all of you. We don't change.
We have an exoskeleton. It's armor. Nothing gets to us. Cockroaches
are perfect, and we will outlive you all. Whether critics get it,
whether the media get it is beside the point. We're together, and I
have more records to make and miles to go before I sleep. That's
Robert Frost.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Kiss is still storming across the country with an
over-the-top act that critics discounted two decades ago doesn't
surprise Simmons. ``I can be falsely modest,'' he said. ``But any
champion worth his salt must be cocky and brazen.'' It's like being
a tight-rope walker, he said, if you doubt your ability, you fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thrill for me on a personal level is looking out
on stage and seeing Ace and Peter back in the band,'' Simmons said.
The reunion two years ago was something nobody expected after the
acrimonious split-up in large part because of Frehley's and Criss'
drug use at the time. They both have since gone clean.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were like a dysfunctional family,'' Simmons said. ``We
weren't torn apart from within, we were torn apart from without _ I
like that; I'm going to use that in my next interview _ we were
torn asunder from without.''
</P>
<P>
   While Frehley and Criss had a problem with drugs, each of the
band members acted in ways he now regrets, Simmons said. ``Now it
makes me proud the band is as it should have been,'' he said. ``The
pieces all had to be there for the puzzle to be whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Already known for their larger-than-life stage shows, the band
is taking it even further this tour with the additional element of
3-D visuals. Others have pointed out that life is already
three-dimensional, so what more can be done? If you're Kiss,
plenty.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's concert at the Ervin J. Nutter Center ``will decimate
you,'' Simmons said with typical confidence. ``It will drop five
pounds off any fat girl within 20 feet of the stage. The lights
will change your skin tone. And that's besides the 3-D.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as the 3-D effects are concerned, ``it's difficult to
explain to somebody what the experience is like,'' he said. ``The
phrase `you won't believe your eyes' is apropos. We believe in
assaulting the senses. No passive sort of experience here. It's
over the top. It's for the eyes and ears together.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a spectacle. And that's the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love magic,'' Simmons said. ``I don't want to know that
Santa Claus is really Uncle Tim with a pillow up his shirt. I like
to look out at a Fourth of July fireworks show and just suspend
belief. I like just looking at stars, not analyzing them, and just
go 'wow.' Magic is good. Don't tell me how it works.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to analyze Kiss is an equally wasted effort for Simmons.
``Ultimately, we are what we are.'' Kiss has never been about
spreading a message, such as saving the rain forest and the dangers
of acid rain, he said. ``Just shut up and rock. We get paid to
entertain you.''

 &HT;    How to teach your child to be a self-absorbed slob
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those who know me will find it not surprising that I am an
excellent cook of scrambled eggs. In fact, when the goal is
scrambling anything I am darn near a maestro.
</P>
<P>
   Still and all, even in the scrambling of eggs I usually need an
assistant. For some years now, the chief assistant has been my
daughter. She is the Chief Egg Cracker and, as such, she knows no
peer.
</P>
<P>
   Well, she is usually the Chief Egg Cracker.
</P>
<P>
   Because the other night, when I asked her to perform her usual
duties, something funny happened.
</P>
<P>
   A weary look came over her face. She frowned. She sighed. She
rolled her eyes. She said, ``Do I have to do it right now?''
</P>
<P>
   I told her that she could sit where she was. Being the Chief Egg
Cracker requires a commitment to the art. It is not something that
can just be ordered done.
</P>
<P>
   I cracked the eggs myself.
</P>
<P>
   In the process of doing so, I couldn't help but think about what
my daughter had done. It was not such a terrible thing, of course.
In fact, the most remarkable part about it might be that I can
never remember my daughter refusing such a task in her short life.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was something disturbing about it all. I couldn't
help but wonder where my daughter had learned the subtle technique
of brushing someone off. Even more than that, there was something
familiar about that look on her face.
</P>
<P>
   And then it hit me. I knew exactly where she'd learned that
behavior. From me.
</P>
<P>
   And I recognized the look on her face. I knew exactly where I'd
seen it before.
</P>
<P>
   In the mirror.
</P>
<P>
   It all came flooding back to me. Just how many times, sitting at
home in my pink recliner, had she come to me holding a book?
</P>
<P>
   I had read a great many of them, but how many times had a weary
look come over my face? How many times had I frowned, sighed,
rolled my eyes and said ``Do I have to do it right now?''
</P>
<P>
   More times than I can remember or count and they didn't just
have to do with reading, either. I've put her _ and her sister and
brothers _ off on a hundred different subjects a hundred different
times each from reading books to playing catch.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it happened because I was legitimately busy but, as
most of you know (because it is true of yourselves), usually I'm
not too busy, I am just too lazy.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't any wonder, then, that she would do the same to me. It
would only be odd if she did something different. We train our
children to complain, roll their eyes and turn away. If we're
self-absorbed slobs, we can count on our children turning out that
way.
</P>
<P>
   Not that my child is a self-absorbed slob. Not yet. It is my
theory that self-absorbed slobs are made, not born; that if we
weren't such good role models for being self-absorbed, our children
would not learn it so well.
</P>
<P>
   This goes beyond reading books. It is the reason people stay
home in droves on clean-up Marshall day. It is why we have to pay
people (that is, the government) to do some of the good we could be
volunteering to do ourselves. Do it ourselves, that is, if we
weren't busy thinking only of what directly benefits us.
</P>
<P>
   The eggs got cracked, because, after all, that is an easy thing
to do, but in the process something else was broken, something
important and elemental and as fragile as an egg. But unlike
Humpty-Dumpty, you can put caring and sharing your time back
together again. At least I am going to try.

 &HT;    Tree hunting time again
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ We barely had cleared the turkey from the
Thanksgiving table when my wife brought up the dreaded subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to do something about the Christmas tree,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't nag,'' I replied, ``I told you I'm going to take it to
the dump first chance I get.''
</P>
<P>
   The Christmas tree has been behind the shop and out of sight
since we took it down on New Year's Day. All the needles have
dropped off. Only a skeleton remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I should have gotten rid of it,'' I apologized, ``but
with all I have to do now that I don't have a regular job I haven't
had time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not talking about last year's Christmas tree,'' she said.
``It's time to put up this year's tree.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It can't be Christmas again!'' I exclaimed. ``If Christmas is
going to come so soon, why didn't we leave the tree up?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping you could get yourself in the spirit of the
season this year,'' she said. ``There's no reason to make an ordeal
of putting up a tree.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is when you don't own a crane,'' I replied. ``It wouldn't
be an ordeal if you didn't insist on one the size of a California
redwood. Last year I spent an afternoon and half the night sawing
and hacking so the giant you picked out wouldn't punch a hole in
the roof.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't that big when we cut it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' I agreed. ``It grew four feet on the way home.''
</P>
<P>
   The annual Christmas tree crisis has been a thorn in our
marriage from the beginning. The 16-foot ceiling in the den of our
house in Fayetteville accommodated a tree approximately the size of
the one Rich's department store hired a crane to hoist atop the
bridge across Forsyth Street.
</P>
<P>
   After several near disasters with size Triple X behemoths, I
persuaded her to move to the farm. The new house created a new
problem. With 16-foot ceilings I could get by with 10 or 12 inches
of air space between the angel and Sheetrock. With our 12-foot
ceilings in the new house, the angel's wings have to brush the
ceiling. Otherwise, the tree is judged too small. Tree selection
has become an exact science. I was surprised when she suggested a
change in the process this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I always pick one that's too tall,'' she said, ``why
don't I stay home and let you pick out the tree.''
</P>
<P>
   I took a broom into the den and measured how much handle I
needed to reach the ceiling. I marked the handle with tape and
headed to my favorite cut-your-own tree farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Find one that has a good shape,'' she instructed. ``Sort of
tall, well filled out, but not fat.''
</P>
<P>
   I spent a half-hour wandering through a forest of Leyland
cypress, looking for a tree that would qualify for the Miss America
pageant. I eventually found one with a modest waistline but tall
enough to reach the end of my broomstick.
</P>
<P>
   Sawed down, it looked pitifully small compared to some of our
past specimens. ``You'll never get away with that one,'' observed
my semi-farmer son, who spent the best Decembers of his young life
in harness with his brother, hauling logging-size cedars out of the
forest.
</P>
<P>
   My wife was on one of her not infrequent excursions to the
decadent Phipps-Lenox complex in affluent north Atlanta. ``Get it
inside the house before she gets back,'' the semi-farmer advised.
``If it touches the ceiling you'll have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   I rushed home and began rummaging through the attic in search of
the tree stand. Tree stands tend to vaporize when stored. To my
surprise, I found it where I thought I remembered putting it last
New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   The stand slipped easily onto the tree trunk. I didn't have to
saw anything. I eased the tree into the house without removing
doors or shifting furniture. Nothing got knocked on the floor and
broken. I didn't have to say any bad words.
</P>
<P>
   When I wiggled the tree into the usual place in front of the
window and lifted it upright only a inch had to be trimmed off the
top. No wires or ropes were needed to keep it from toppling. I
didn't strain my back or get punched in the eye with a limb. I was
celebrating with a light refreshment when she returned. I was
overwhelmed by her reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the prettiest tree we've ever had!'' she exclaimed.
``It's perfect!''
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, miracles really do happen.

 &HT;    Think sharp when working with 100-year old boards for new floor
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A gentleman in the metro area e-mailed me with a
question that pleased me no end, because it was one I could answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am building a small building in my back yard for my wife to
use as an art studio,'' he wrote. ``I work on the weekends and so
far it has taken me 2 1/2 years. Very early I bought 800 feet of
4x6x16' oak beams from a 100-year-old tobacco warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of it resawn into 5/4 x6x8' boards to use as
flooring. I did not have it tongue and grooved to save money.
Sooner or later I will be laying this flooring. I have looked for
tongue/groove router cutters but none of them will work with 5/4
widths. I have thought of these alternatives:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Running the boards through a router time after time to
achieve a tongue and groove.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Using a biscuit joiner to join the boards together with
countersunk screws covered by pegs when the boards are laid.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``A dado blade on my table saw to achieve the groove and I
guess, with adjustment, the tongue on the other side (again having
to make three passes). Is there a dado blade which can be adjusted
with shims or other spacers to achieve a double cut with the center
left for the tongue?
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not have either biscuit joiner or dado blades. Highland
Hardware in their new catalogue has a Dewalt 682k biscuit joiner
for $170. I haven't checked to know if that is a good price and I
don't know if it is good joiner.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as I know the DeWalt is a good biscuit joiner but I
wouldn't use it for this job. Way, way too much work and too many
chances to screw it up.
</P>
<P>
   A router table would be better, but 100-year-old oak out of a
tobacco warehouse is going to be very close in nature to granite.
You would definitely have to make a lot of passes. Again, too much
work.
</P>
<P>
   The natural way to handle this is with dado blades on the table
saw. Once set up, it can be jigged so that it would be very easy to
complete the entire run in two stages without great difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   My friend will have to buy a good dado set. Not the wobbling
kind, but a real multi-blade set, carbide tipped. One can certainly
buy grooving blades, which are wide blades made to cut slots, and
set them up with shims between them to make a double cut. But this
would be quite expensive and not as useful in the long run as the
dado set.
</P>
<P>
   When cutting joints like this I always cut the male section
first; not sure why. I don't think it's very important.
</P>
<P>
   On these 5/4 boards, a 3/8-inch tongue will be just the ticket,
and it doesn't have to be deep. A quarter-inch would suffice.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing we need to do is make a secondary fence with a
piece of 3/4-inch plywood or MDF. Screw it or clamp it to the
fence, and then run the dado cutters up under the outer half of it.
The blades will have to be so close to the fence when we begin
cutting that damage to the actual fence might result.
</P>
<P>
   Once the secondary fence is in place, set up the fence so that
if one pass is made on each side of the board, the result will be a
3/8-inch wide, 1/4-inch deep tongue exactly in the center of the
edge. Mark the face side of each board.
</P>
<P>
   Now set up the cut with some fingerboards or whatever kind of
holders you have so that you can simply feed each board in, first
with the marked side against the fence, second with the unmarked
side against the fence, and with the same edge against the table
(obviously) on each pass. Set up carefully, this should make
accuracy automatic.
</P>
<P>
   Once the tongues are cut, we have to cut the grooves in the
other edge. Once again, take some scrap and set up the fence and
the blades so that a groove that will just accomodate the tongues
will be run down the dead center of the board in one pass. Make it
a tad deeper than the tongue to hold excess glue.
</P>
<P>
   Set up all the fingerboards and other guides, and begin the run,
making certain to keep the face side of each board against the
fence. This will, one hopes, put any unevenness resulting from
varything thickness in the boards on the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Make the grooving run, and that should take care of it. But
don't be surprised, depending on how many boards you've got, if you
have to stop at some point and take the dado blades to be
sharpened. Hundred-year-old oak is not something I'm anxious to
encounter. E-mail: jwarner(at)ajc.com

 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Here's one you can knock off my holiday gift list
_ a book called ``Circle Round: Raising Children in Goddess
Traditions.''
</P>
<P>
   This is no doubt a well-meaning, earth-friendly volume. The
co-author is a woman named Starhawk, one of the ``foremost voices
in the women's spirituality movement,'' the dust jacket informs us,
who lives in San Francisco with ``her husband, stepchildren, and
Goddess-children.'' (Apparently the stepchildren didn't make the
Goddess cut, but we won't get into that.)
</P>
<P>
   The book is pegged as ``a one-of-a-kind resource for people of
many faiths and beliefs'' that ``encourages us to gently open
children's awareness to the sacredness of life, our connection to
Mother Earth, and our responsibility to preserve her gifts.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, I'll buy that. Open the first chapter, however, and things
get weird: ``Not long ago I (Starhawk) was part of a circle of
women celebrating the First Blood ritual of my Goddess-daughter
Shannon.''
</P>
<P>
   On second thought, I won't buy that. Why fork over the $25.95,
anyway? My daughter is already firmly convinced she's a goddess. We
have, in fact, invested a considerable amount of energy trying to
convince her otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Veronica is our second child, but we were ill-prepared for her
imperial manner and the thunderstorms of her emotions. Alec was a
docile, eager-to-please toddler.
</P>
<P>
   We always assumed it was because of our superb parenting. That
theory has come under scrutiny since Veronica turned 3. People
always talk about the terrible twos, but in my experience, it's the
threes that are the real terror.
</P>
<P>
   Veronica is loving, she is quiet, she looks like Cindy Lou Who
and she's adorable in pigtails.
</P>
<P>
   And she has a will that rivals Elizabeth I and a temper that
rivals the Queen of Hearts in Alice in Wonderland.
</P>
<P>
   When she's in one of her moods, she won't simply ask for
chocolate milk. ``Mommy, I WANT
chocolatemilkchocolatemilkchocolatemilkCHOCOLATE MILK!'' Her words
run together and her face turns beet red and I'm waiting for her to
shout, ``Off with her head!'' I try hard not to laugh at her 30
pounds of uncontrolled fury because I'm pretty sure that would be
bad parenting.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of which, Veronica is now in the third year, fourth
month of her valiant struggle to remain un-potty-trained. Just ask
John Rosemond: This means we are bad parents and just plain morally
deficient.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Rosemond can insult us all he wants if he can just get the
job done. Brag to us all you want about how your kid was
potty-trained at three months, so long as you're ready to take the
Veronica Challenge. We've tried bribes, candy, praise, big-girl
pants, videos. (It's Potty Time, featuring those immortal lyrics,
``She is a super-duper pooper, she can potty with the best.'')
</P>
<P>
   Nothing. Like a tiny Queen Victoria, she insists, ``We will do
things in our own way and in our own time.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked a friend with a teen-age daughter when it starts getting
better. ``You must be kidding?'' she retorted. ``She's a teen-ager.
She thinks she's a goddess every moment of every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Is there any sanity for the modern parent, any saving grace
between ``goddess traditions'' and John Rosemond? There are oceans
of books and columns out there, telling parents what we're doing
wrong and the five easy steps to perfect children.
</P>
<P>
   Bring 'em on. Let 'em try. I can't wait for the day John
Rosemond knocks on my door.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt he'll achieve instant results with my Goddess-daughter
Veronica.

 &HT;    ROAD TRIPS: CLINTON HEADS TO GAZA, MASADA AND BETHLEHEM
 &HT;    With MIDEAST, MIDEAST-STAKES and MIDEAST-SECURITY
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service(at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   During his three day visit, President Clinton will spend his
nights in Jerusalem but will be on the road during the day. Here
are destinations on his schedule.
</P>
<P>
   THE GAZA STRIP
</P>
<P>
   The People: Approximately one million Palestinians, two thirds
of them refugees from Israel, as well as 6,000 Israeli settlers.
</P>
<P>
   The Land: A strip along the Mediterranean Sea, about 25 miles
long and three to five miles wide.
</P>
<P>
   The Government: 80 percent controlled by Palestinian National
Authority. The rest is ruled by the Israeli military.
</P>
<P>
   History: A key transit point in the Middle East, Gaza was
settled more than 4000 years ago and has been fought over ever
since. Some believe Samson was buried there. Napoleon camped there.
In 1967, Israel captured it from Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   The Intifada uprising against Israeli occupation started there
in 1987 and hundreds died over six years of street battles. Israel
began withdrawing its troops under terms of the 1993 Oslo peace
process.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton Visit: On Monday, Clinton will travel by helicopter to
the first Palestinian airport, opened last month, and watch the
Palestine Liberation Organization reaffirm that it no longer seeks
the destruction of Israel. He will be the first U.S. president to
visit a Palestinian-controlled area.
</P>
<P>
   BETHLEHEM, WEST BANK
</P>
<P>
   The People: Approximately 140,000 Palestinians in the city and
suburbs. Adjacent to several large Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
   The Land: Urban center on rolling hills about 5 miles south of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The Government: Almost all Palestinian residents under
Palestinian control. Israeli army controls entrances and site of
Rachel's Tomb, sacred to Jews.
</P>
<P>
   History: Traced back to at least 1400 B.C., this is the
birthplace of King David and Jesus Christ. In 339 A.D., a massive
church was built on the cave believed to be the site of Christ's
birth. Now, the area is mostly Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton Visit: On Tuesday, in what aides are calling a
``spiritual visit,'' Clinton will visit the Church of the Nativity
and review preparations for the millennium celebrations. All major
roads are under repair and several buildings are going up. A
cultural center is being built where there used to be a jail used
by the British, then Israelis, then Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   MASADA ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE:
</P>
<P>
   The Land: Jagged Mount Masada rises dramatically from the barren
desert west of the Dead Sea and a two hour drive south of
Jerusalem. Ruins mark the site of a magnificent cliff-side palace,
water tanks and defense walls.
</P>
<P>
   History: This mountaintop became a Roman fort in 103 B.C. Jewish
rebels eventually took it over and used it to raid neighboring
villages. When the Romans laid siege and broke their defenses in 74
A.D., legend has it, the 960 Jews decided to commit suicide.
</P>
<P>
   While many historians believe there were just a few suicides and
otherwise a massacre by the Romans, the story is central to Israeli
identity. For years, Israeli troops were taken there for a ceremony
at the end of their training.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton Visit: On Tuesday, Clinton will visit the mountaintop.
The stop will give Clinton's day a certain balance to his earlier
stop in Palestinian-dominated Bethlehem.
</P>

 &HT;    Books make long-lasting holiday gifts
 &HT;    By Jay Milner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that December is upon us again, although it hasn't been all
that noticeable as far as the weather is concerned, why not think
about giving books for Christmas gifts?
</P>
<P>
   There's very little else you can give that would last as long
and give as much pleasure, unless you're thinking about diamonds or
something in that category, and, if so, you might consider giving a
whole library.
</P>
<P>
   But for most of us a single book would be a lasting and
worthwhile Christmas gift, especially for, well, for just about
anybody you care about.
</P>
<P>
   If you need some suggestions, how about these:
</P>
<P>
   ``Cold Mountain'' by Charles Frazier (Atlantic Monthly Press).
</P>
<P>
   It's particularly pleasant when a book we love becomes a best
seller without a lot of hype. ``Cold Mountain'' is such a book.
It's Frazier's first novel and publishers more often than not send
first novels out without expensive artificial legs, then nod and
say, ``I knew it wouldn't sell'' when it sinks without creating a
stir on its own.
</P>
<P>
   But now and then, a book will cause an uproar and wind up a best
seller on its own, by word of mouth mostly, although a few sensible
critics may help it along with rave reviews. ``Cold Mountain'' was
raved about by critics and readers alike, and gradually became a
best-seller without the expensive hype. And it's worth it, one of
the best novels I've read in a long time.
</P>
<P>
   It's an absorbing story with characters that are real and
sympathetic. Set during the closing months of the Civil War, it
follows a Confederate deserter's trek back home were his wife is
waiting and living her own adventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Patchwork Planet'' by Anne Tyler (Knopf).
</P>
<P>
   I'm one of the many people who greet every new Anne Tyler novel
with a joyful noise. So far I haven't been disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Any lover of good books would be happy to receive this, or any
Anne Tyler book for that matter, as a Christmas gift. (Most of her
others are in paperback.)
</P>
<P>
   Plots aren't the most important aspects of a Tyler book. Oh,
there's always a good story that keeps you interested in the
outcome, but it's the characters and the writing that make Tyler
stand out.
</P>
<P>
   In ``A Patchwork Planet'' the main character is Barnaby Gaitlin,
who earns a living in an unusual manner. Here's the way he explains
his job: ``The company I work for is called 'Rent-a-Back.' How I
got into it is a whole other story, but basically we provide a
service for people who are old or disabled. Any load you can't
lift, any chore you don't feel up to, why just call us.''
</P>
<P>
   As Barnaby goes about his work for various elderly and disabled
men and women, he becomes involved in their lives because that's
the kind of guy he is. He even grows attached to the grumpy ones.
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times reviewer wrote the following about another
Tyler book, words that could be applied to this new one or any
other Tyler book. ``Tyler does nothing fancy, nothing tricky. But
so rigorous and artful is the style, so measured and delicate is
each observation, so complete is the structure and so astute and
open the language, that the reader can relax, feel secure in the
narrative and experience the work as something real and natural _
even inevitable _ the story that appears to unfold of its own
accord is a fairy tale of sorts, a fairy tale with echoes of both
the tragedy of King Lear and the absurdity of the modern romance
novel.'' She took the words right out of my word processor.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the latest novel by El Paso writer Cormac McCarthy,
``Cities of the Plain'' (Knopf).
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy is called by some ``the Texas Faulkner,'' and there may
be some legitimate cause for this, although I'm not sure I go for
it 100 percent. I will go along part way on that, which means that
in my mind he is something special as far as contemporary writers
in America are concerned. This latest book of McCarthy's is the
third in his ``Border Trilogy.'' The other two are ``All the Pretty
Horses'' and ``The Crossing.'' Any one or all three of these would
be fine Christmas gifts for a serious reader. I emphasize the
``serious'' here because these are not light reading by any means,
but worth the effort by any measure.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of heavy reading ... well, not so heavy you'll have
trouble getting
</P>
<P>
   through it and understanding it. The author here is straight
forward and easy to understand, but the subject is heavy. I'm
talking about David Halberstam's newest best seller, ``The
Children'' (Random House, 783 pp., including the index, $29.95).
</P>
<P>
   This is the detailed history of eight young black college
students, who in the 1960s, found themselves propelled into the
leadership of the civil rights movement (to quote from the book
jacket) as the movement and America entered a period of dramatic
change. Halberstam, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter and author,
was working on the Nashville Banner when this movement
</P>
<P>
   began, a 25-year-old reporter assigned to cover this story.
</P>
<P>
   Like all Halberstam's books, this one has received rave reviews
from coast to coast. It would make a great Christmas gift to people
who would appreciate it.
</P>
<P>
   All these books are keepers for now and future generations to
read and enjoy and learn.
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, there's that brand new book ``Confessions of a
Mad Dog.'' (University of North Texas Press) by that fellow Jay
Dunston Milner. It would make a fine Christmas gift for any friend
or family member who is interested in Texas writers of song and
story, such as Willie Nelson, Bud Shrake, Dan Jenkins, Gary
Cartwright and others of that ilk, who in the 1960s formed a sort
of social and literary club called Mad Dog, Inc., with the motto,
``Doing indefinable services to mankind.''
</P>
<P>
   I've read it and it is indeed funny and informative. We're
trying to cast
</P>
<P>
   the movie version now.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Milner, who can be reached at jpownall(at)coxnews.com,
writes for Cox Newspapers and unabashedly promotes his own book.

 &HT;    SECURITY FOR CLINTON VISIT TAKES DAILY ISRAELI PRECAUTIONS TO
NEW HEIGHTS
 &HT;    For use Saturday with MIDEAST, MIDEAST-STAKES and MIDEAST-SITES
 &HT;    EDS: Originally moved Thursday. Resending for those who missed
it.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM This is the land of high security, but it may never
have been as tight or complex as when President Clinton visits here
beginning Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Even on normal days, police stop drivers in the road to ask for
identification and search the trunks of cars entering shopping
malls.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli soldiers and settlers routinely walk in restaurants or
stores with M-16s strapped across their backs or revolvers tucked
in their belts. Bomb squad vans constantly patrol the streets,
checking hundreds of suspicious packages each day during times of
suspected terrorist activity.
</P>
<P>
   But never before, according to Israeli police spokeswoman Linda
Menuchin, has there been such a complicated assignment for the
protection of a visiting dignitary.
</P>
<P>
   At times during the three-day visit, as many as 4,450 extra
Israeli police will be assigned to provide security for Clinton _
nearly 20 percent of the police in this small country. There will
be 500 police officers patrolling the area around Clinton's hotel.
</P>
<P>
   This does not include Israeli secret service and army units that
will handle parts of the trip, or the thousands of Palestinian
police on duty when Clinton visits areas they control.
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton is coming with what former Israeli secret service
chief Carmi Gillon estimates may be 400 security personnel. If
Clinton's visit is like most other presidential foreign trips, his
security forces will have been in place for weeks examining travel
routes, ``sweeping'' hotel rooms for electronic listening devices,
positioning video cameras to monitor hallways and planting
high-tech equipment around buildings to detect unauthorized
intruders.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge, Menuchin pointed out, is that at times Clinton
will be at one site, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton will be at
another, daughter Chelsea Clinton will be elsewhere and Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright will be in yet another location. All
will need protection. Sixteen members of Congress also will be here
and they will require security.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will see efforts of the kind we haven't seen before,'' said
Gillon. ``The issues are much more sharp now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For every terror group, to act against the United States with
all this media around, it is their dream,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The issues revolve around the Israeli-Palestinian agreement
negotiated in October at the Wye River Plantation in Maryland. It's
intent was to keep the five-year-old Middle East peace process on
track, but extremists on both sides are dissatisfied with it.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the thousands of police will be near Clinton. Many will
have their hands full trying to patrol areas of East Jerusalem
where Palestinians have been engaged in fierce battles with Israeli
troops in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, police expect right wing Jewish groups to stage
protests. On Thursday, they posted illustrations around Jerusalem
showing Clinton in an Arab head cloth with the caption,
``Palestinian, go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian terrorists have frequently launched attacks in the
days before official U.S. visits. In recent interviews, spokesmen
for Hamas, the militant wing of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, have appeared to try to downplay any threat to
Clinton himself, saying they have never targeted Americans.
</P>
<P>
   However, they said that their organization has small splinter
groups that could act on their own _ statements that maintain the
uncertainty that feeds their image.
</P>
<P>
   In order to help control the environment in
Palestinian-controlled Gaza City, schools and offices will be
closed when Clinton visits on Monday. He will be the first American
president to visit a Palestinian-controlled area.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli police plan to close major roads used by Clinton for
several hours at a time and will tow away cars parked along the
route, presumably out of fear that they might be rigged with
remotely-triggered bombs.
</P>
<P>
   For the last several days, U.S. security specialists have been
working on phone and radio systems to be used during Clinton's
visit. U.S. military helicopters, including one appearing to be
Clinton's white-topped official chopper, have conducted days of
</P>
<P>
   maneuvers above Jerusalem, Gaza and Bethlehem, the birthplace of
Jesus where Clinton also will visit.

 &HT;    Coke buys rival brands abroad
 &HT;    By Mickey H. Gramig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Co. is buying Cadbury Schweppes'
beverage brands in 120 countries, in a deal estimated at $1.85
billion, the companies announced today.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate announcement, Coca-Cola warned analysts the
company's fourth-quarter earnings, expected to come in at 30 cents
per share, would be 24 cents to 25 cents per share. The company
blamed volatile sales in many overseas markets that have been
facing economic woes.
</P>
<P>
   Trading of Coca-Cola on the New York Stock Exchange was delayed
this morning because of the company's news, which was expected to
impact share prices.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition, which does not cover Cadbury Schweppes'
business in the United States, France and South Africa, includes
Schweppes and Canada Dry mixers, Dr. Pepper and Crush, and beverage
plants in Ireland and Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is subject to regulatory review in a number of
countries, but is anticipated to be completed in mid-1999,
Coca-Cola said.
</P>
<P>
   M. Douglas Ivester, Coca-Cola's chairman and chief executive,
discussed the deal this morning with analysts in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``These agreements will allow the Coca-Cola Co. to participate
in segments of the beverage business where it currently does not
have meaningful entries,'' he said in a statement. ``The Cadbury
Schweppes brands will be a wonderful addition to the core brands of
the Coca-Cola Company.''
</P>
<P>
   John Sunderland, chief executive of London-based Cadbury
Schweppes, said the deal will create ``substantial value for our
shareowners and simultaneously enhance our ability to develop and
focus on our strong global confectionary and U.S. beverage
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Cadbury Schweppes is the world's No. 3 soft drink company,
behind No. 1 Coca-Cola and No. 2 Pepsico. The acquisition will give
Coca-Cola, which now has a 50 percent worldwide market share, about
3 additional share points.
</P>
<P>
   It also will give Cadbury Schweppes an influx of cash to become
a larger player in the world's confectionary business and help
bankroll its bottling and distribution system in the United States,
where it relies largely on Pepsico, Coca-Cola Enterprises and
small, independent bottlers to get its soft drinks to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and industry insiders today expressed confidence in the
Cadbury Schweppes deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes abundant sense if you're Coca-Cola because there's
one goal, and that goal is straightforward: To continue to build
world share. To build world share, you need brands, and you need
systems,'' said Tom Pirko, a New York-based beverage consultant.
</P>
<P>
   John Sicher, editor of trade publication Beverage Digest, said
Cadbury Schweppes' brands will have more opportunity to grow
worldwide through the Coca-Cola system.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a deal that works for both parties,'' he said. ``And
it will give them an infusion of a substantial amount of money to
continue to do two things: Build their brands in the U.S. and
perhaps even more importantly, to continue to consolidate the
independent bottling system.''
</P>
<P>
   David Lang, an analyst at Henderson Crosthwaite, said the deal
``sorts out the places where Cadbury's systems weren't strong
enough to compete with Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were fighting with PepsiCo for their market share. It was
a murderous battle, and they were getting nowhere with it. This
gives them a war chest for investment and for buying back shares.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal will affect about 450 Cadbury Schweppes employees, who
will have the opportunity to take jobs with Coca-Cola, the company
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good news from a strategic point of view,'' said Julia
Bannon, an analyst at Paribas. ``It's another example of how
Cadbury is refocusing. If you look at the share price, the market
is telling us it thinks it's great.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the sale, Cadbury also will sell its bottling
businesses outside the United States. The company is talking to
potential buyers for the businesses, which Cadbury said are worth
about $800 million.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Cadbury Schweppes PLC entered a joint venture with
U.S.-based Carlyle Group to acquire two soft-drink bottlers,
Beverage America and Select Beverages, for $724 million.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was seen as an important step by Cadbury to secure its
distribution system for soft drinks such as 7Up, Dr Pepper, Canada
Dry, Sunkist and A&AMP;W. Cadbury trails Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola Co.
in the $55 billion U.S. soft drink industry.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Schippers' sarcastic rant sums it up
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his summation of the case against President Clinton, David
Schippers, prosecuting attorney for the Republican majority, hit
just the right note to end the Judiciary Committee's impeachment
hearings and cap the six years' pursuit of the president that had
led to them: Sour. Rank.
</P>
<P>
   Not content to lay out the evidence and coach the committee in
the conclusions he believed the evidence would justify, Schippers
was by turns sneering, sarcastic, contemptuous and mocking toward
the president _ in the service, he oddly insisted, of preserving
the dignity of the office.
</P>
<P>
   Even Americans who judge the case properly fatal to the Clinton
presidency should be unnerved by the obvious venom of Schippers'
chosen rhetoric _ carried to the point of, in effect, counseling
other governments never again to trust Clinton's word as president.
(A nice little service to the republic, that.)
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yes, the lawyer salted his performance with expressions of
regret at his unpleasant duty, but his every attitude shouted a
contrary relish for his own studied excesses. This was not the
sober, measured summing up that so solemn a constitutional moment
called for. It was a barroom peroration, with Clinton _ at long
last, for the eager claque of his committed haters _ as scheming,
devious, sexually wanton and endlessly lawless. Clinton as pure
evil.
</P>
<P>
   That is the Clinton hunted from the moment of his first election
by a richly bankrolled and indefatigable array of right-wing
political operatives, fax-driven radio ranters and evangelical
personality assassins. And, of course, crucially, the Clinton
submitted, uniquely among presidents, to a permanent special
prosecution peculiarly licensed to chase every howl sent up by the
hounds.
</P>
<P>
   It should disturb every American _ as it does most, at least
most outside Congress _ that at the end Clinton and the nation have
been brought to constitutional crisis by a trap set for the
president by a politically scheming book agent manipulating an
avaricious tattle and using the (witting? unwitting?) special
prosecutor to service a meritless lawsuit that conservative
activists had provoked Paula Jones to file.
</P>
<P>
   The House will be judging not just Clinton but his pursuers and
their pursuit as well. Impeachment not only would propose the
ultimate sanction for the president's misdeeds but would endorse _
and, endorsing, install as a permanent and devastating feature of
our political life _ the disturbing means by which they were
brought to light.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lies and other misbehaviors in the Lewinsky
matter do count; they warrant the stinging and humiliating rebuke
in the strong censure proposed by Democrats. Schippers' rant to the
contrary notwithstanding, what we have here is not an
out-of-control president, as we had in Richard Nixon, but an errant
husband trying to tiptoe back into the house at 4 in the morning
and tripping over the furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Do we take down two elections for that?

pre-schools stay busy this time of year focusing on the real

   BUSINESS-FINANCIAL NEWS (``f'' category)
</P>
<P>
   WORKING-COLUMN (Undated) _ There aren't many tougher experiences
in life as when you lose your job. It doesn't really make any
difference if you get cut loose because your company filed for
bankruptcy protection or because you were a lousy employee _ it's
still extremely painful. And one of the first worries is how to
find another job. To help ease that transition, many employers
offer severance pay, continue to subsidize the cost of medical
insurance for a time and offer outplacement assistance. By L.M.
SIXEL
</P>
<P>
   POWER-OUTAGE (San Francisco) _ An apologetic PG&AMP;E promised not
to sock customers with the cost of claims stemming from Tuesday's
massive blackout, but said its stockholders will pay up to $10
million in claims. By SETH ROSENFELD.
</P>
<P>
   COMPUTER-COLUMN (Undated) _ For 3D realism and state-of-the-art
game technology, nothing beats Sierra Studio's Half-Life. That is,
so long as you're playing it alone. By DWIGHT SILVERMAN
</P>
<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT (``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-STARTREK (Undated) _ ``Star Trek: Insurrection'' is
even more brain-numbingly stupid than ``Star Trek V: The Final
Frontier,'' which had Kirk and Spock singing ``Row, Row, Row Your
Boat'' around a campfire. This gives Jonathan Frakes the dubious
distinction of having unseated William Shatner as director of the
worst Trek movie in existence. By AMY BIANCOLLI.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-STARTREK-REVIEW (Undated) _ There are problems in the
``Trek'' universe. But don't blame the cast of ``Star Trek: The
Next Generation,'' now in their third big-screen effort. The
problems with the new movie, ``Star Trek: Insurrection,`` stem from
the screenplay by Michael Piller. By BRUCE WESTBROOK.

<P>
   SPORTS (``s'' category)
</P>
<P>
   FBN-PACKERS-INJURIES (San Francisco) _ Have you seen the Green
Bay Packers lately? In fact, you haven't. Nobody has. This week's
Packers' injured list includes a broken collarbone, a torn
hamstring, a broken ankle, a broken jaw, four knees, three
shoulders and ... well, 17 players are on blocks, 13 questionable,
doubtful or just plain out. By RAY RATTO.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   LYNCH-COLUMN (Albany, N.Y.) _ At one time or another, almost
everybody has neighbor problems. I know I have. I'm recounting this
story because it's a vivid example of the law's shortcomings in
preventing threatening situations from becoming tragedies. By DAN
LYNCH.
</P>
<P>
   SALTER-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Tuesday morning's major power
outage brought commerce to a halt and cost the city, Pacific Gas &AMP;
Electric and businesses large and small untold millions of dollars.
I'm sorry about that, but I sure enjoyed the way everything in San
Francisco got ratcheted waaaay down. By STEPHANIE SALTER.
</P>
<P>
   WONG-COLUMN (Oakland, Calif.) _ Two days before ``60 Minutes''
showed Dr. Jack Kevorkian apparently injecting a terminally ill man
with a lethal dose of medicine, my wife and I faced some hard
questions about life and death ourselves. We were in an attorney's
office, signing something called ``Durable Power of Attorney for
Health Care.'' By WILLIAM WONG.
</P>
<P>
   PEARL-HARBOR (Danville, Calif.) _ To millions of Americans, the
meaning of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor went far beyond the
end of neutrality and the beginning of war. With a combination of
shock, fear and moral outrage, the 2-hour raid evolved from an
unforgivable act into an inspiration, becoming the defining moment
of an entire generation. By CYNTHIA BASS.

NEW TREK MOVIE DESERVES TO BE LOST IN SPACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is ``Star Trek: Insurrection'' the worst Trek movie ever made?
</P>
<P>
   Let us rephrase this. Are Klingons crabby? Do Ferengi cheat? Is
Deanna Troi doomed to intergalactic ridiculousness?
</P>
<P>
   The answer to all of the above questions is: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   In case anyone was wondering, ``Star Trek: Insurrection'' is
even more brain-numbingly stupid than ``Star Trek V: The Final
Frontier,'' which had Kirk and Spock singing ``Row, Row, Row Your
Boat'' around a flickering campfire. This gives Jonathan Frakes the
dubious distinction of having unseated William Shatner as director
of the worst Trek movie in existence. Someone phone Shatner; he'll
be glad to hear it.
</P>
<P>
   Frakes directed the previous Trek outing, 1996's ``Star Trek:
First Contact'' (the first that exclusively featured the cast of
``Star Trek: The Next Generation''), with humor and competence, so
there was no cause to expect his second effort to be so
painstakingly bad. Then again, there was no cause to expect a movie
in which Worf's acne, Troi's ``boobs'' and Data's butt are major
punch lines.
</P>
<P>
   There's a giddy, cliff's-edge quality to the whole thing, as
though the actors laughed when they read the script, then murdered
their agents in despair. ``Can anyone remember when we used to be
explorers?'' asks the ever-upright Capt. Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick
Stewart, giddiest of all), to which the weary Trek fan must reply:
I wish I didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who never cared about ``Star Trek'' has no reason to
mourn, of course. But for those of us who were weaned on ``Star
Trek,'' who worshiped the old show and gobbled up the new ones and
saw the first few movies multiple times, this deterioration of the
Trek realm is nothing short of tragic. It's Star Dreck.
</P>
<P>
   Things are pretty dippy from the beginning, as the film opens on
an agrarian idyll where white people dressed in earth-tone clothing
are kneading bread and blissfully smiling at each other. Imagine
how surprised they all are when a renegade android, who turns out
to be a malfunctioning Commander Data, crashes into their paradise
and holds them hostage for no compelling reason.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is particularly clear, but it seems that Data was
part of a hush-hush mission to observe the smiling bread-makers.
The mission, we sort of learn, is a joint effort between the
Federation, embodied by an augustly bearded but
not-entirely-trustworthy admiral (Anthony Zerbe), and a group of
shifty aliens called the Son'a. The Son'a, in the grand tradition
of repulsive bad guys (remember the Borg Queen?), look like poster
children for Facelift Abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The head Son'a (a vaguely recognizable F. Murray Abraham) makes
his entrance in the middle of cosmetic surgery _ we get to see a
surgeon pull his face back, then clip it to his skull with metal
clasps. Several reels later, he dispatches an opponent with a
deadly eye tuck. Scary.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, back on the ship, Picard's first officer, Riker
(played by Frakes), is busy cooing at his old flame, ship's
counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis). They steal kisses, share a
bubble bath and grin stupidly through several scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Even more irritating is the movie's insistent jokiness, which
pushes a horrid, forced hilarity on all of the regulars. Among the
movie's many low points is a sequence in which Picard and the
malfunctioning Data, captaining separate shuttles, engage in a
cat-and-mouse space race while belting out a tune from ``H.M.S.
Pinafore.'' At one point, Data actually pulls up beside Picard and
glares at him through the window, like a dude in a muscle car
looking to drag.
</P>
<P>
   The screenplay is credited to Michael Piller, who's been
involved as producer or creative consultant in all of Trek's recent
television incarnations, which probably accounts for its awkwardly
paced dialogue and bloated-episode plotting. Conversations are
stuffed with inside references (the Dominion, Data's emotion chip,
past romances) and the sort of incomprehensible techno-talk that
Trekkers have come to expect (much blabbing about torque sensors
and multiphasic particles and positronic matrixes).
</P>
<P>
   But where previous Trek outings have snared viewers' interest
with engaging characters and philosophic story lines, this one is
content to crack a few bad jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Jean-Luc, you used to be explorers. And, whoops, we used to
care.

CONSCIENCE AND A VOTE ON IMPEACHMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The pro-impeachment crowd is urging members of the House of
Representatives to ``vote their conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Who could argue with that? All of us hope and expect that
members of Congress will vote their conscience on every issue that
comes before them.
</P>
<P>
   But when people who favor impeachment expound on the
requirements of conscience, they are obviously suggesting that the
only vote a righteous conscience could produce would be ``yes.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to intimidate congressional fence-sitters _ mostly
moderate Republicans _ into voting for impeachment by defining a
``yes'' vote as a vote of conscience and a ``no'' vote as something
less than that.
</P>
<P>
   But is it? In this rare business of impeaching the president of
the United States, how can anyone know for sure who is guided by
conscience and who is following some lesser instinct?
</P>
<P>
   As anyone who has followed the House Judiciary Committee's
hearings could attest, the impeachment issue is totally immersed in
partisan gamesmanship. There are probably committee members who are
driven by conscience rather than politics, but how can we know for
sure?
</P>
<P>
   Republicans seem to sincerely believe that President Clinton has
committed high crimes and misdemeanors in connection with the
sex-and-lies scandal that has dogged him for 11 months. Democrats
seem to sincerely believe that Clinton's conduct, though
reprehensible, does not rise to the level of impeachability.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also a sense that the Republican majority on the
Judiciary Committee would gladly impeach Clinton for felonious
lip-biting, while the Democratic minority would grimly defend him
if he had robbed an armored car at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Americans with no ax to grind either way might also suspect that
the pro-impeachment and anti-impeachment forces would simply switch
sides if the president facing impeachment happened to be a
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Wild-eyed partisanship is nothing new in American politics. But
in times of crisis, this country has often transcended political
concerns because of politicians who truly followed the dictates of
conscience.
</P>
<P>
   One such individual was Sen. Edmund G. Ross, who cast the
deciding vote in the 1868 impeachment trial of President Andrew
Johnson. Ross voted to acquit Johnson of the charges against him,
denying the president's opponents the two-thirds majority that the
Constitution requires for conviction and removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   The vote effectively ended Ross's political career and wrecked
his life, according to ``Profiles in Courage,'' John F. Kennedy's
book about political figures who followed their conscience at great
cost to themselves. The charges against Johnson were mostly
unfounded and politically motivated, Kennedy wrote, but public
sentiment at the time favored removal of the president; Ross's vote
allowing Johnson to remain in office made the Kansas senator a
target of widespread indignation, relentless ridicule and even
``physical attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's how Ross explained his vote in subsequent writings, as
quoted by Kennedy:
</P>
<P>
   ``If ... the President must step down ... a disgraced man and a
political outcast ... upon insufficient proofs and from partisan
considerations, the office of President would be degraded, cease to
be a coordinate branch of the government, and ever after
subordinated to the legislative will. It would practically have
revolutionized our splendid political fabric into a partisan
Congressional autocracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross' vote 130 years ago might have nothing to do with the 1998
impeachment debate. Or it might have a lot to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   If most Americans don't want Clinton impeached _ as the opinion
polls suggest _ but the Republican-controlled Congress impeaches
him anyway, is our country facing the prospect of a ``partisan
Congressional autocracy''?
</P>
<P>
   And if it all comes down to one vote, will that vote be cast by
someone whose conscience is ruled by political partisanship _ or by
someone with the courage of Edmund G. Ross?
</P>

PLAYOFF ANGST GRIPPING OWNERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - These are nervous times for fantasy owners.
</P>
<P>
   Who wants to spend all year fighting to get to the playoffs,
only to lose because a quarterback sprains his ankle in the first
quarter, or a receiver spends the day nursing a sore leg?
</P>
<P>
   Just ask the guys who started Jacksonville quarterback Mark
Brunell or Minnesota's Cris Carter.
</P>
<P>
   With that playoff angst in mind, my fearless fantasy predictions
for some of this week's NFL match-ups:
</P>
<P>
   Arizona at Philadelphia: Eagles running back Duce Staley should
leave cleat marks all over the Cardinals, who are decimated on the
defensive line as they wait for Eric Swann to undergo radical
bunion surgery. I don't expect much from the Cardinals running
attack, though Jake Plummer should be good for two or three scores.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago at Green Bay: Look for Bears wide receiver Bobby Engram
to have a nice game against the Packers, whose pass rush has gone
the way of all cheese. This would be a bounce-back for Brett Favre,
but his receiver corps is hurting. Heck, Max McGee was trying out
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati at Indianapolis: Neil O'Donnell fall down and go
boom, so the Bengals will play quarterback roulette. Running back
Corey Dillon should break out against the Colts, whose run defense
consists mainly of yelling ``You come back here right this
minute!''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas at Kansas City: The Chiefs can't tackle Grandmama, so
Emmitt Smith should bounce back. Deion Sanders' toe still hurts, so
Rich Gannon might have fun against the Dallas secondary.
</P>
<P>
   Denver at New York Giants: If you have Broncos, you know what to
do. If anybody scores points for New York, it will be running back
Gary Brown or backfield mate Charles Way. My money is on a shutout.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota at Baltimore: They may have to call this one in the
early rounds. Cris Carter is iffy, though he's always played with
minor injuries before. Trouble is, the Vikings don't really need
him.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland at Buffalo: Don't expect Doug Flutie to excel against
the Raiders defense, which is top-rated against the pass. The
Raiders passing game is a mess _ Donald Hollas threw six
interceptions against Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh at Tampa Bay: They're dumping beer on Kordell Stewart
in the Steel City, and Jerome Bettis is starting to look like just
another fat guy. I like Bucs receiver Reidel Anthony since
Pittsburgh's Carnell Lake will have to cover Bert Emmanuel.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee at Jacksonville: With Brunell sitting this one out,
Jaguars running back Fred Taylor _ who ran for a team-record 183
yards last week _ will have to carry the load. Jacksonville backup
quarterback Jamie Martin isn't half bad, so receivers Jimmy Smith
and Keenan McCardell are worth a look.
</P>
<P>
   Washington at Carolina: Trent Green has looked OK lately, but
he's lost two of his top receivers _ Michael Westbrook and James
Thrash. Terry Allen was as rusty as a pasture gate last week.
Carolina running back Tshimanga Biakabutuka has taken Fred Lane's
job.
</P>
<P>
   New York Jets at Miami: The Jets dominated the Dolphins in Week
5, so I wouldn't expect much from running back Karim Abdul-Jabbar
or Dan Marino. Look for Jets wide receiver Wayne Chrebet to light
it up from the slot position this week. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Waiver wire
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chargers running back Terrell Fletcher would be a nice addition
to any backfield. Seahawks receiver Mike Pritchard is starting to
heat it up. I also like Panthers receiver Muhsin Muhammad. &QL; 
 &QL; 
One-hit wonder
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This week, it's Saints wide receiver Andre Hastings, who had 122
yards and a touchdown against the Cowboys, who actually used

<P>
   Unlike the Academy Awards or the Tonys or the Emmys, there's
never a shortage of deserving nominees when it comes time for the
annual GOOF (Greatly Overhyped and Overexposed Fool) Award.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's winner was Jerry Springer. The year before that, it
was Dennis Rodman. You get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no one aspires to the GOOF _ a gigantic trophy made
entirely of goat cheese carved into the image of the original
winners, Milli Vanilli _ but every year, dozens of worthy
contenders emerge, and 1998 was no exception.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the glittering nominees, though, only one gets to take
home the GOOF.
</P>
<P>
   Before we crown our winner, let's pay tribute to the 1998
nominees. Please hold your applause _ and your guffaws _ until all
the names have been read.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ OPRAH WINFREY. For singing her own theme song, for hammering
us over the head with her charitable greatness, for making the
nearly-unwatchable bomb ``Beloved,'' and for the New Age nuttiness
on her show that threatened to drive away a good portion of even
her most devoted fans. And what's with that disingenuous ``street''
voice she lapses into when she's dishing with someone like Whitney
Houston? What's that about?
</P>
<P>
   _ PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON. Liar.
</P>
<P>
   _ JOEL SHERMAN. You've never heard of him, but he's the New York
Post sportswriter who honored Mark McGwire's 70-homer season by
placing McGwire seventh on his Most Valuable Player ballot.
</P>
<P>
   I think I'll take Sherman out for some appetizers so we can
discuss this ridiculous decision. And then we can have an
appropriately New York Postian headline: ``Headless Writer in Tapas
Bar.''
</P>
<P>
   _ MARY KAY LETOURNEAU. The Seattle schoolteacher and her
teen-age lover, who's now all of 15, brought another baby into this
world and penned a self-pitying book, ``Un Seul Crime, L'Amour''
(``Only One Crime, Love''), which for now is available only in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about a busy gal! Just think of all she could accomplish if
she wasn't behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   _ LYING REPORTERS and THEIR ENABLING EDITORS. Twentysomething
wonder boy Stephen Glass concocted intricate, elaborate and wildly
implausible feature stories for The New Republic, Rolling Stone,
George and other national publications, while his editors ignored
protestations from subjects who quibbled with his pieces by saying
things like, ``Um, that never happened.'' Somehow Glass was able to
produce literally dozens of bogus pieces before the piles of lies
caught up with him.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Boston Globe stars Mike Barnicle and Pat Smith were
fired for writing fiction disguised as newspaper columns. (Barnicle
also was busted for publishing jokes by George Carlin as his own.)
While Barnicle wasn't particularly repentant, he at least spared us
the sanctimonious stance of Smith, whose final ``apology column''
was filled with self-pity and insulting excuses, and who has since
turned her dismissal into performance art poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Are any of these people ever going to apologize to the
colleagues whose livelihoods and reputations they jeopardized with
their elaborate deceits?
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to hear a poem about that.
</P>
<P>
   _ RYAN LEAF. ``I'm a big, rich, goodlooking, talented
quarterback in the NFL! Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!!!!''
</P>
<P>
   _ DR. LAURA SCHLESSINGER. The syndicated sensation _ who is
raking in tens of millions of dollars with her unique brand of
common-sense advice peppered with niceties like, ``Don't be a
loser!'' and ``No wonder you don't have any friends!'' _ was
humiliated twice this year, first when Vanity Fair published a
scathing profile, and then with the publication on the Internet of
nude photos from about 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, though, the photos weren't all that humiliating. Dr.
Laura was smokin' back in the '70s!
</P>
<P>
   _ JACK KEVORKIAN. For co-starring in and producing the first
prime-time network-broadcast snuff film in TV history.
</P>
<P>
   _ ALAN DERSHOWITZ. One of the great legal minds of our time is
apparently addicted to cable TV appearances _ which only serve to
shine a spotlight on his horrifically brownish teeth. Cancel
Geraldo and get thee to a dentist, Dershowitz!
</P>
<P>
   _ KENNY ANDERSON. According to The New York Times, Anderson
budgeted $120,000 for ``hanging out money'' during the NBA lockout,
but he was considering a few cost-cutting moves like selling one of
his seven luxury cars (the Mercedes) and he was concerned about
being able to support the four children he has fathered with three
women.
</P>
<P>
   The piece unleashed a torrent of criticism, but Anderson said he
wasn't upset because ``some people don't even know of The New York
Times. They don't even read The New York Times. ... The corporate
world probably reads it. But a lot of my friends who I deal with,
they read the New York Post comics and look at the pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   _ MARY BONO. Mourned Sonny, ran for Sonny's congressional seat,
won Sonny's congressional seat, sheared and darkened her blond
hair, turned against her mentor Newt and called for his
resignation, dissed Sonny for drug use in TV Guide, took up with a
country singer stud and lobbed Kathie Lee-type questions at Kenneth
Starr, all within the span of a single year!
</P>
<P>
   Now, if only she'd marry U2's Bono, divorce him and marry NFL
quarterback Steve Bono, she'd be Mary Bono Bono Bono.
</P>
<P>
   _ HOWARD STERN. Still a comedic genius, but his weekly show on
CBS is behind ``Saturday Night Live'' in the ratings, and there
have been numerous cancellations from affiliates who are disgusted
with the freak-show theatrics.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem: It's one thing to hear Stern on the radio
as he pokes fun at the raggedy collection of losers who parade into
his studio _ but when you actually see some of these people reduced
to tears, it's just not that hilarious. There's too much of an
imbalance of power; when a famous millionaire star is shown mocking
the uneducated and the physically unfortunate, he comes across not
as a rebel but a bully.
</P>
<P>
   _ PAULA JONES. Was rendered nearly attractive by nose job and
total makeover, but she still grated with her ``Roseanne''
appearance by repeatedly opening her mouth, whether it was to crack
her chewing gum or assault our ears with her piercingly high voice
and her stupid opinions.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Worthy honorees, one and all. Just being nominated is
accomplishment enough _ and in previous years, any of the above
might have taken home the GOOF.
</P>
<P>
   This year, though, was particularly stupid. So without further
ado, the winner is ... wait a minute, we have a tie! The co-winners
of the 1998 GOOF are:
</P>
<P>
   LINDA TRIPP and MONICA LEWINSKY!
(Clap-clap-clap-clap-clap-clap-clap...)
</P>
<P>
   Congratulations, gals. Your telephonic chatterboxing produced
tape after tape of scintillating conversations about the sad little
sexcapades of poor deluded Monica and our pathetically horny
president, aka ``Butt-head.''
</P>
<P>
   Chowing on junk food, watching TV and clattering endlessly like
a couple of sophomores who can't stand those phonies from the
``in'' group, you two set back the women's movement 10 years and
helped fuel the most ridiculous and unnecessary political scandal
in modern history. At this time last year, only a few Washington
insiders knew your names, but now you're as famous as Lorena
Bobitt, Jessica Hahn, Donna Rice or Tonya Harding.
</P>
<P>
   Accept this GOOF in good health, and bicker among yourselves
about who gets to take it home.

 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The woman lives in an Albany suburb. I'm keeping
her name to myself because she seems to have trouble enough
already. Her problem is the neighbor from Hell.
</P>
<P>
   At one time or another, almost everybody has neighbor problems.
I know I have. I'm recounting this story because it's a vivid
example of the law's shortcomings in preventing threatening
situations from becoming tragedies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This started about three-and-a-half years ago,'' the woman
said. ``My daughter was walking home from school, and she dropped
some flour from a school project in the road. It was a very small
amount, about half the size of a pencil.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a neighbor who lives two doors away. He flipped out,
started swearing at her. She ran home. My husband was mowing the
lawn. This guy came up on our property and started swearing at my
husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since then, this guy has driven over my lawn, thrown
apples in my pool. We have a lot of police reports on this, to back
this all up. Anyway, we ended up getting an order of protection _ a
temporary one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The minute I got it, he violated it the next day. My kids were
on their way to school, and he started swearing at them. My one
daughter, she was 11 at the time, and my other daughter was 9. They
were going to the school bus, and this guy starts calling them
whores.''
</P>
<P>
   This neighbor, the woman said, is one strange guy. He's 40ish,
lives alone in a house with heavily draped windows. He doesn't seem
to work. He seems to spend much of his time calling the IRS or the
building inspector or the dog warden to report the woman and her
family for imaginary violations of the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``He calls all those places where you don't have to give a
name,'' the woman explained.
</P>
<P>
   The woman finally had the guy arrested after he exposed himself
to her kids during one of his screaming fits. She ended up with
another protection order that required the guy to stay away from
her property and her kids for a year. He then swore out a complaint
against her, alleging that she'd thrown a cup of coffee at him. She
didn't do that, she said, but she had to hire a lawyer and spend
some money before a local court dropped the charge.
</P>
<P>
   Now the order of protection has expired, and this woman is
frightened. She has a guy living two doors away who has engaged in
bizarre, hostile behavior toward her and her family. She has seen
him lurking around the store she manages in another town, well away
from the neighborhood where she and this guy live. A local cop
familiar with this situation backs up the woman's story.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy's a head case,'' the officer said. ``She's a very
nice lady ... He has been arrested for a couple different things.
He has tormented the living daylights out of her ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I would venture to say that he has some type of mental illness
... It's frustrating for us. I want to go up there to give this guy
a blanket party to get him to leave her alone, but I obviously
can't do that ... So far, he has shown no violent tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, hey,'' the officer told me, ``you never know. The scary
part with this guy is that he just persists. He won't let it go.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman is now afraid that something horrible is going to
happen here. And, she realizes, there's nothing the authorities can
do to help until and unless it does.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they told me,'' she said, ``is that, `We don't take care
of the beginning. We take care of the end.''
</P>

IN-VITRO FERTILIZATION IS A PAIN IN THE BACK

<TEXT>
<P>
   Women who become pregnant through in-vitro fertilization suffer
twice as much back pain as those with natural pregnancies,
researchers in Sweden have found.
</P>
<P>
   Per Kristiansson and his colleagues at the University of Uppsala
asked a group of women to keep a record of when they had back pain
during late pregnancy. Those with IVF pregnancies reported pain
twice as often as women with natural pregnancies (``Human
Reproduction,'' vol. 13, p. 3,233), and those with most pain had
the highest concentrations of the hormone relaxin in their blood.
</P>
<P>
   Relaxin is produced by the ovaries during pregnancy, and IVF
drugs which stimulate the ovaries to produce eggs increase the
levels. The hormone loosens ligaments that hold the hip bones
together, and Kristiansson believes this causes the pain because
bones can grind together. ``This may be a drawback to high levels
of relaxin,'' Kristiansson says. ``Maybe there are others too.''
</P>
<P>
   To avoid such side effects in IVF patients, Kristiansson
suggests stimulating the ovaries and extracting the egg cells as
usual, but then freezing them. If eggs are later inserted in a
normal menstrual cycle rather than one boosted with IVF drugs, the
levels of relaxin in any resulting pregnancy should be normal.

   Women who become pregnant through in-vitro fertilization suffer
twice as much back pain as those with natural pregnancies,
researchers in Sweden have found.
</P>
<P>
   Per Kristiansson and his colleagues at the University of Uppsala
asked a group of women to keep a record of when they had back pain
during late pregnancy. Those with IVF pregnancies reported pain
twice as often as women with natural pregnancies (``Human
Reproduction,'' vol. 13, p. 3,233), and those with most pain had
the highest concentrations of the hormone relaxin in their blood.
</P>
<P>
   Relaxin is produced by the ovaries during pregnancy, and IVF
drugs which stimulate the ovaries to produce eggs increase the
levels. The hormone loosens ligaments that hold the hip bones
together, and Kristiansson believes this causes the pain because
bones can grind together. ``This may be a drawback to high levels
of relaxin,'' Kristiansson says. ``Maybe there are others too.''
</P>
<P>
   To avoid such side effects in IVF patients, Kristiansson
suggests stimulating the ovaries and extracting the egg cells as
usual, but then freezing them. If eggs are later inserted in a
normal menstrual cycle rather than one boosted with IVF drugs, the
levels of relaxin in any resulting pregnancy should be normal.
</P>
<P>

agrees Randall Renegar, an endocrinologist at East Carolina
University in Greenville, N.C. &QL;

 No. 497 for Dec. 11  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Dec. 9-10, 1998. This is not the National Football League,
where all referees are infallible, all coin tosses are heads and
the ball doesn't have to make it into the end zone if the ball
carrier's mother lives somewhere in that direction. This is the
Burned-Out Newspapercreatures Guild, where referees are invited to
pull our finger and this is BONG Bull No. 497!
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HOW TO TELL IF YOU'RE BURNED OUT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   You may be a burned-out newspaperman or newspaperwoman if:
</P>
<P>
   _You know at least four newsroom managers who have no clippings
in their clip files.
</P>
<P>
   _You keep forgetting the difference between a staff car and a
trash bin.
</P>
<P>
   _You think the secretarial staff is right, enough cake-and-punch
parties do make us Pulitzer Prize material.
</P>
<P>
   _You personally know at least five felons, and one or more was
on the payroll.
</P>
<P>
   _You always circulate a memo saying, ``I will be out of the
office this afternoon; anyone needing a problem solved, see Wally''
and then one day you forgot and no one noticed, even Wally.
</P>
<P>
   _You don't think it's about sex or perjury either.
</P>
<P>
   _You don't recognize more than half the bylines on Page 1, any
of the isues mentioned on the editorial page, three vegetables on
the food page even by their pictures, or the Diversity Committee's
right to tell you what to put in your coffee.
</P>
<P>
   _You and your bartender have decided it's more convenient to pay
your bar tab weekly.
</P>
<P>
   _You laugh when you think about Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   _You have no idea what the writing coach is talking about but
that's all right because the writing coach refuses to talk to you
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   _You've seen at least two newspaper redesigns in 20 years return
to the original look.
</P>
<P>
   _You're the one all the reporters ask about really historic
stuff, like things that happened in the Carter administration and
when ball parks had grass in them.
</P>
<P>
   _You do at least three things a day that the security guards
have code numbers for.
</P>
<P>
   _Your annual review includes witness statements about what you
said when your supervisor suggested you attend a newspaper seminar
on your vacation time.
</P>
<P>
   _You don't want your mother to know the nickname the newspaper
librarians have for you.
</P>
<P>
   _The last time you smiled was when you got the last staff car.
</P>
<P>
   _You don't own a watch or a suit worth having cleaned.
</P>
<P>
   _You remember what caused five stains on the newsroom floor, and
two of them are from before the carpet was installed.
</P>
<P>
   _You don't know where your copy of the style book is.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AT BAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Chris Bunch adds to last week's anecdote about Bat Masterson,
sportswriter, that in fact the famous gunfighter spent more time in
his life as a reporter than he did slinging iron. It seems so
unfair that he should have been portrayed on early TV for his minor
accomplishments, instead of his action-packed years as a boxing
writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did keep a .45 on hand ... in his desk drawer,'' Bunch
said. ``Which he used whenever a fan looked him up in New York.
He'd allow the fan to wine and dine (Delmonico's by preference)
him, then lead the conversation around to `Well, haven't got much
from the old days ... except ol' Betsy here (dragging open the desk
drawer), which I sure don't need in this big city...love to let her
go ... but only to somebody who'd appreciate her...'
</P>
<P>
   ``Which was the cue for the slavering fan to dig out great
stacks of greenbacks, and Masterson would reluctantly pass the
smokepole across. The fan would disappear, and the chuckling
Masterson would head for the nearest pawn shop, buy another .45
for, say, $10 (new ones were going for $15) and bait the trap for
the next sucker.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say that when Masterson kicked, and all of the guys who
owned `Bat's original Peacemaker' came out of the woodwork, the
screaming was shrill and varied.''
</P>
<P>
   Bat died at his New York Telegraph typewriter on Oct. 25, 1921,
aged 67. In his machine was found the beginning of a column about
luck coming out fairly even for everyone. Rich or poor, for
instance, everyone gets about the same amoung of ice. But the rich
take theirs in summer, and the poor get it in winter.

Graphic, Ace Photographer for the Chagrin Falls Commercial
Scimitar, and his Faithful Companion, Typo the Wonder Pig.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PANEL ONE: &LR;  The Deft Duo sit raptly watching the Judiciary
Committee hearings when Speed, in his trenchcoat, a deathbed gift
from an ancient mystic wire service executive editor on a
fog-shrouded eastern island, remarks, ``I don't know, Typo! I think
I would remember if I ever gave a hatpin to a young woman such as
her!'' Looking up from his Racing Form, Typo starts, ``If you mean
she's zaftig say zaftig, Boss! You don't have to use kindly terms
because I'm sensitive about my (sniff) waistline!''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PANEL TWO: &LR;  Speed defends, ``No, Typo! I'm talking about gifts
in general! Does that woman in the gallery behind the committee
counsel look like Absentee Publisher Gimlet Peen in his tango
costume? Would you give her a present without expecting something
in return?'' Typo enquires, ``Something in return? You mean like
signing an affidavit?''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PANEL THREE: &LR;  Speed queries, ``And what about the women in the
gallery, Typo? How come at all these Washington hearings, you
always see a mysterious, semi-exotic woman in the seats right
behind the witness, and nobody ever says who she is?'' Typo scoffs,
``That's what I like about you, Boss! Despite all the bruises, down
deep you're still basically a romantic ...!''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PANEL FOUR: &LR;  Typo's eyes turn to pinwheels as electricity
passes between him and a mysterious, semi-exotic woman in the seats
right behind the witness.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PANEL FIVE: &LR;  Speed tries to restrain his pal, exhorting,
``Typo! Typo! You can't just convert the copy desk coffee urn to a
low-orbit rocket and take off without the editors' permission!''
Typo asserts, ``Outa my way, Boss! I'm off to the nation's capital
and my date with destiny! And I don't care if it does convert the
coffee to a potent aphrodisiac, against whose effects only copy
editors are immune!''
</P>

   In the corner of the panel a popout scroll reads: ``UH-OH!''

   Liver transplant patients may be less likely to reject their new
organs if the use of immunosuppressant drugs is delayed for a few
days.
</P>
<P>
   Animals often accept transplanted livers in the absence of the
immunosuppressant drugs that are always given to human transplant
patients to combat rejection of the organ. Even stranger, if a
heart or another organ is transplanted with a liver, it may also be
tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Bishop of the Centenary Institute in Sydney, Australia,
suspected that this tolerance depends on the initial interaction
between the host's immune cells and those that enter the body
inside a transplanted liver.
</P>
<P>
   Previous animal experiments have shown that tolerance is
associated with a surge and then a reduction in the number of
activated T cells _ which normally attack transplanted organs. If
the liver is irradiated to kill its immune cells, this doesn't
occur and the organ is rejected.
</P>
<P>
   This suggests that the body's T cells are at first stimulated by
the immune cells that enter with the transplanted liver, but then
die off. To test that idea, Bishop and his colleague Alex Sharland
transplanted livers or kidneys into rats and monitored what
happened to the T cells. Kidneys don't induce immunological
tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, the number of activated T cells that had undergone
apoptosis, or naturally programmed cell death, was far higher in
the transplanted livers than in the kidneys, which were rejected.
But when the rats received the immunosuppressant drug
methylprednisolone along with a new liver, far fewer apoptotic T
cells appeared in the organ.
</P>
<P>
   If immunosupressant drugs similarly disrupt the liver's ability
to induce tolerance in people, problems with rejection may be
reduced by delaying the use of such drugs. &QL;

BLACKOUT BRINGS POWER TO THE PEOPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Tuesday morning's major power outage brought
commerce to a halt and cost the city, the Pacific Gas and Electric
Co. and businesses large and small untold millions of dollars. I'm
sorry about that, but I sure enjoyed the way everything in San
Francisco got ratcheted waaaay down.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic. Noise. Conspicuous consumption. People's blood
pressure. Attitude. Although the comparison was made to 1989, San
Franciscans were not as sweet and docile on Tuesday as we were
after the Loma Prieta earthquake. But we were nicer, slower and
quieter than usual, and that made walking in the city a dream.
</P>
<P>
   Heading up Powell Street towards Union Square, I was stunned. At
Post and Powell, where cars, trucks and cable cars usually form a
horn-honking mess, there was but a handful of vehicles and only the
pleading taxi whistle of the doorman at the Sir Francis Drake
Hotel. The one place on Powell serving hot food was a pizza joint,
and business was brisk.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Saks, a half dozen well-turned out saleswomen stood
behind locked glass doors. Peering out, self-conscious smiles on
their faces, they were the epitome of ``All dressed up and no place
to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the street on the front door of Borders Books and Music,
an excruciatingly neat hand-lettered sign said: ``Borders Is
Temporarily Closed Due To Power Failure.'' Later on in North Beach,
I would find the emotional (and aesthetic) opposite of that sign,
taped to the front door of the U.S. Post Office: ``No power _
Closed 'til later.''
</P>
<P>
   At Bush and Powell, the first of several stalled cable cars sat
in the intersection. The two-man crew was tucked inside the coach,
one reading a newspaper, the other listening to a portable radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the electricity in the barn that pulls the cable,'' said
the guy with the radio. ``We've been here since 8:15.'' It was
11:45 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of Nob Hill, I looked down California Street towards
Market. Again, on a normal day, this stretch of city street would
be a long, narrow sea of autos and delivery trucks. Tuesday, I
could count every vehicle in the 14-block expanse: 21 cars, two
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   That was about the time ``Waltzing Matilda,'' the theme from
``On The Beach,'' began playing in my head. The 1959 film (about
the end of the world, thanks to nuclear holocaust) has a famous,
chilling segment of shot after shot of the wind-swept and
thoroughly lifeless streets of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Grace Cathedral seemed like a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   A sign on one of the front doors announced that the 12:10
Eucharist had been moved to the Chapter Room. But the magnificent
Anglican church was open, and inside a handful of folks shuffled
their way in sock feet around the Labyrinth _ a replica of the
design (c. 1220) on the floor of Chartres Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   I'd been meaning to do this for ages, but never seemed to find
the time. ``Walking the Labyrinth invites us to experience our
gratitude for life and meets our longing for a change of heart,'' a
sign said. Tuesday, all I had was time, so I laid my shoes next to
Benny Bufano's statue of St. Francis of Assisi and waded in.
</P>
<P>
   It took about 10 minutes to reach the center, or
``Illumination.'' The sign had encouraged me to stay there as long
as I wished, but I spent only about a minute; I wanted to get back
outside before power was restored and the city once again became an
angry, grinding, modern metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   The appetite-tweaking smell of Chinese food wafted up Mason
Street as I walked through Chinatown toward North Beach. Somebody
had electricity. Four more cable cars sat frozen on the Mason line,
one caught in mid-turn at Washington Street.
</P>
<P>
   Lights or no lights, every Chinese produce stand was open, with
proprietors estimating the weight of bok choy and spinach and
making change the old-fashioned way from silent, open cash drawers.
</P>
<P>
   I slid across mighty Broadway as if it were a country lane and
headed down Stockton. I was hungry but had only two bucks on me.
All ATMs were still down, but I figured Ed and Mary Etta Moose
would take a check.
</P>
<P>
   Outside their restaurant, Moose's, a chalkboard offered a
``Blackout Menu'' of seven dishes. Inside, a bunch of society dames
sat at tables in the window and the Mooses huddled in the candle
glow near their long bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about a glass of red wine?'' Ed said. ``And maybe some
split pea soup?''
</P>
<P>
   I had both (and a ham and cheese sandwich) while Mary Etta and I
sat and talked for more than an hour about the genius of artist Sam
Provenzano, Tom Wolfe's new book, religion and how newborn babies
and the recently deceased can actually give you part of their
spirit if you're at all awake.
</P>
<P>
   At 1:28 p.m., the lights in Moose's came on and most of the
patrons applauded. Mary Etta, however, groaned and said, ever so
softly, to a waiter: ``Would you please dim the lights?''
</P>
<P>
   I nearly kissed her.

THE GOOD SIDE OF THE JACK KEVORKIAN SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM WONG  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Two days before ``60 Minutes'' showed Dr. Jack
Kevorkian apparently injecting a terminally ill man with a lethal
dose of medicine, my wife and I faced some hard questions about
life and death ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   We were in an attorney's office, signing our new wills and
setting up a trust. Among the documents was something called
``Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care.'' On page 3 of this
document was the following passage: ``Health care decisions to be
made by my agent pursuant to this paragraph shall be made
consistent with those of my desires initialed below. If no desires
are initialed below, my agent shall make such decisions in good
faith and its best judgment, consistent with my best interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``1. I desire that my life be prolonged to the greatest extent
possible, without regard to my condition, the chances I have for
recovery or long term survival, or the cost of the procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``2. If I am in a coma which doctors have reasonably concluded
is irreversible, I desire that life-sustaining or prolonging
treatments not be used.
</P>
<P>
   ``3. If I have an incurable or terminal condition or illness and
no reasonable hope of long-term recovery or survival, I desire that
life-sustaining or prolonging treatments not be used.
</P>
<P>
   ``4. I do not desire treatment to be provided and/or continued
if the burdens of the treatment outweigh the expected benefits. My
agent is to consider the relief of suffering, the preservation or
restoration of functioning, and the quality as well as the extent
of the possible extension of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   My wife and I separately and privately read those four points.
As I read them over several times, I gulped, realizing the gravity
of what was before me. I won't reveal which, if any, of the four
points my wife or I initialed, but I know I watched the Kevorkian
interview and tape with extra interest.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was because I had attended the funeral of a 92-year-old
woman from Oakland's Chinatown and read about the death of yet
another old Chinatown leader. Maybe it was the memories of the
deaths years ago of both my parents and one of my older sisters.
All three suffered over a long period before passing away. I do not
recall whether any of them expressed a desire to end their lives to
alleviate the sustained pain, and I do not recall whether, within
our family, the subject of euthanasia ever came up.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever, Kevorkian surely got my attention _ and that,
apparently, was his point, as was getting arrested so the legal
system can decide whether euthanasia is a criminal act.
</P>
<P>
   The showing of this death by ``60 Minutes'' has been roundly
criticized, but I think it served a worthy public purpose, even
while it obviously served CBS's commercial interests. None of
Kevorkian's numerous other assisted-suicide cases has had quite
this impact. If it triggers a heightened public debate over the
morality and ethics of euthanasia, then all the better.
</P>
<P>
   Having made my choices on the four points cited above, I cannot
say that I am comfortable with what I chose. I am not displeased,
however, with having to think about this most fundamental
life-and-death issue while I am relatively healthy and of
relatively sound mind. I am also comforted by the fact that I can
change my mind.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking about terminal illnesses and medically-assisted suicide
and euthanasia isn't usually the kind of thing most of us like to
do, especially if we are not in a personal crisis. But one cannot
predict when the time will come to face these all-important issues.
As obnoxious as Kevorkian may be to many people, he has provided us
invaluable food for thought.

LEARNING LESSONS FROM THE PEARL HARBOR SURPRISE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA BASS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DANVILLE, Calif. _ Dec. 7 was the 57th anniversary of the
surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. On that day in 1941, at 7:53 a.m.
Hawaiian time, the Imperial Japanese Navy woke up a sleepy American
naval base with a massive preemptive strike, killing 2,400 people
and catapulting this officially-neutral nation into World War II.
</P>
<P>
   To millions of Americans, the meaning of Pearl Harbor went far
beyond the end of neutrality and the beginning of war. With a
combination of shock, fear and moral outrage, the 2-hour raid
evolved from an unforgivable act into an inspiration, becoming the
defining moment of an entire generation.
</P>
<P>
   Defining moments are different _ and much more significant _
than simply a moment that someone remembers. Defining moments are
events that so profoundly influence how a country perceives both
itself and the world that they help change that country's political
life for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, it's hard to imagine the Soviet Union lasting as
long as it did after 1945 without its World War II defining moment:
Stalingrad, with all the shared heroism and suffering the word
embodies. Nor is the transformation of Germany into a stable
democracy imaginable without its defining moment, when the Allies
liberated the concentration camps and forced the German people to
come to terms with what had been going on inside.
</P>
<P>
   For the generation of Americans then living through World War
II, Pearl Harbor was such a moment. It taught America that the
price of indolence was destruction, and the cost of vulnerability
was death.
</P>
<P>
   Indolence and vulnerability stalked Pearl Harbor in the days
before the attack. Troubling intelligence reports were routinely
ignored. When they weren't ignored (why was the Japanese consul in
Honolulu burning files?), they were explained away with lightweight
logic (it's nothing _ all consuls burn files). Because an attack
from halfway across the Pacific seemed so unlikely, it was never
conceded that it might be possible; therefore almost no
preparations had been made to protect lives or material.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 7, Pearl Harbor was indeed a pearl, available for the
taking.
</P>
<P>
   To Mitsuo Fuchida, the Japanese naval officer who issued the
famous ``Tora! Tora! Tora!'' message that signaled the attack had
been both a success and a complete surprise, the most surprising
element of all was how completely exposed he found his objective.
The target vessels of Battleship Row, consisting of the doomed
Arizona and her six sister battleships, stood not only undefended
but _ along with 87 other ships _ bottled up, crammed like true
sitting ducks into a three-mile-square cluster. This same lack of
preparedness was even more ironically displayed at the Hickam and
Wheeler airfields: fearing sabotage _ but never imagining an
outright attack _ pilots had lined up their planes wingtip to
wingtip, making them easy to guard but even easier to destroy.
</P>
<P>
   As news of Pearl Harbor spread to the mainland _ which it did
even as the attack was in progress _ the lessons that were to guide
the United States through both World War II and the Cold War began
to take shape: the need for eternal vigilance, the need for serious
intelligence-gathering, the need to stand tall _ and well-armed _
in the face of the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, these lessons continue to function today. But
only partially, for in post-Vietnam America, perhaps in response to
some of our Cold War failures (or our successes), attention has
shifted from Pearl Harbor to Hiroshima. These days, in teaching, in
research, and in popular culture, dropping the A-bomb is often
considered the defining American moment of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Today, we should remember that it was the surprise attack on
Pearl Harbor that led, in time, to the surprise attack on
Hiroshima. Had America been more awake on Pearl Harbor morning, the
road to Hiroshima might have never been taken. If vigilance is the
price we pay to avoid enduring _ or for that matter, inflicting _
surprise attacks, it would seem, as we veer from one undefined
military adventure to the next, well worth the effort.

HEARINGS AN UNTIDY SHOWCASE FOR HYDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In many ways, the House Judiciary Committee
hearings are winding up exactly as chairman Henry Hyde didn't want.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde vowed to work for bipartisan support, but this week's
expected vote for articles of impeachment is likely to be strictly
partisan. He promised civility _ and he has often tried mightily to
ensure it _ but the panel's food-fight style has proved ready-made
for parody on ``Saturday Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   Barring a surprise, the committee will vote within days to
approve articles of impeachment against President Clinton, a move
that Hyde does support and has helped ensure. But Hyde's road to
the impeachment vote has been rocky, and he seems to sense that his
place in history is being rewritten daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole process has been a downer,'' Hyde told reporters
late Wednesday night, after yet another long day of partisan
wrangling over whether to impeach President Clinton on grounds that
he lied about his relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's abilities could soon be put to yet another test. If the
House approves articles of impeachment, Hyde has the authority to
act as the manager _ or de facto prosecutor _ of the case before
the Senate. Hyde has not said whether he will take up that
challenge, but there is speculation that he will take a pass,
giving much of the responsibility to another House member or
perhaps to his friend, committee GOP chief investigator David
Schippers.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, few if any of the participants in the impeachment
hearings have come off looking good, which may be inevitable in an
investigation that revolves around allegations of presidential
sexual misconduct with an intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all look bad cause it's a bad issue,'' Representative
Robert Wexler, a Florida Democrat, said on CNN earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   With every member of the panel acting in a partisan manner, Hyde
probably has little chance to emerge as a modern-day equivalent of
former representative Peter Rodino, the New Jersey Democrat who was
widely praised as chairman of the impeachment hearings in the
Watergate case. Rodino, Republicans note, enjoyed a committee in
which some GOP members ultimately voted with the Democratic
majority in passing three articles of impeachment against President
Richard M. Nixon. On the Hyde committee, some Democratic members
have been sharply critical of Clinton and said he lied under oath,
but none are expected to vote for articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde knew he would be under attack from the start. Last
February, in an interview with the Globe, Hyde said he wouldn't be
surprised if Clinton's defenders went after him, ``attacking the
messenger with a fury.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Hyde's difficulties began almost immediately
after the 74-year-old Illinois congressman was billed by
Republicans as the model of a fair-minded chairman. An Internet
magazine, Salon, reported in September that he had an affair with a
woman 30 years ago, even though he was married at the time.
</P>
<P>
   While Hyde decried the report as irrelevant, it inevitably has
made it more difficult for him to question the president's affair
with Lewinsky. More recently, new reports have focused on the fact
that he said during the Iran-contra hearings in 1987 that lying was
understandable in some cases, leaving unexplained why Clinton's
lying is more significant than that by figures such as former
Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters more difficult, Hyde finds himself at the pinch
point of a Republican Party deeply divided between conservatives
and moderates. Hyde's panel is viewed by many as being controlled
by the House's most partisan members, such as committee member Bob
Barr of Georgia. House Whip Thomas DeLay is widely viewed as
running the party's impeachment strategy. The party's moderates,
meanwhile, have no voice on the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans seem pleased with Hyde's performance. ``I have
heard respect, affection, and gratitude that he did a job while a
lot of other people went into hiding,'' said Republican strategist
William Kristol, editor of the Weekly Standard magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, of course, see it differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``History will condemn the procedures and the process that Henry
Hyde presided over,'' said Representative Martin T. Meehan, a
Massachusetts Democrat, referring to the way Republicans have
orchestrated witnesses and evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat who sits
on the Judiciary Committee and has worked with Hyde for years, said
the chairman has been ``procedurally fair'' since the hearings
began. But Frank said that is almost irrelevant because the
underlying strategy of the hearings is ``very unfair'' because it
is so partisan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, he doesn't enjoy this because his reputation has
taken a hit,'' Frank said.
</P>
<P>
   While Hyde has made clear he is in favor of impeachment, he has
striven to give Democrats time to present their case against it,
even if he knows that case will fail. At times, Hyde has exhibited
his frustration with a dig at Democrats on the panel. ``The White
House and the Democratic committee members' response to the
allegations to the referral has been Shakespearean: full of sound
and fury signifying nothing,'' Hyde said. The referral is the
report written by the independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde has, however, won plaudits from Democrats because he plans
to allow a vote on a resolution to censure Clinton instead of
impeaching him. But Hyde knows that vote is likely to fail along
party lines and that impeachment will probably be approved in the
same manner.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Democrats launched another attack on Hyde, arguing
that the committee has not given Clinton's defenders enough time to
present their case against impeachment. Representative Melvin Watt,
Democrat of North Carolina, proposed a motion allowing more
witnesses to testify.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have given lip service throughout this process that no one
person is above the law,'' Watt said. ``The process this committee
has followed throughout this investigation has consistently treated
the president of the United States below any procedural due process
that we would ever think of providing innocent citizens of the
United States of America.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hyde tried to explain that witnesses had been called, Watt
interrupted him. This clearly upset Hyde, who cut short his reply,
saying ``If you don't want to be informed . . .'' Hyde then called
a vote on Watt's motion, which was killed along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   Such frequent outbursts have visibly upset Hyde, who said
earlier this month that Democrats seemed focused on ``personal
attacks on the chairman.''
</P>
<P>
   In his conversation with reporters on Wednesday night, Hyde was
asked how he would like to be remembered. ``I was a good
congressman. I accomplished some things, and when my time comes,
I'll be missed,'' Hyde responded, without mentioning the
impeachment hearings.

CHRISTMAS LIVES IN THE FAITH OF CHILDREN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several years ago, I read that the age at which kids start to
doubt there is a Santa _ about 8 _ hadn't dropped much over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   You can add my 9-year-old to that group of uncertain children.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, everybody knows reindeer can't fly,'' Jamila
argues in measured tones. ``And how in the world can a big fat man
get down a chimney with a bunch of presents? There isn't a Santa
Claus, and when I grow up I'm going to the North Pole to prove
it.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure she has ever believed in Santa Claus, but
personally, I love the thought of a bearded old man making toys and
delivering them to the world's children. I always have, and that's
what I told my little skeptic.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do?'' she asked with suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me, too, Mama,'' her sister, Asha, added before I could
answer. ``He can squeeze through a chimney if he holds in his
stomach.''
</P>
<P>
   Asha most certainly believes, as you can tell by a look at her
Christmas list this year. At the very top was this little item:
``my own checking account.'' Who but Santa could grant such a wish
to a 7-year-old as good to herself as Asha?
</P>
<P>
   In any case, I don't know what to make of Jamila's argument,
especially because it was delivered on the same morning she offered
up a Christmas wish list nearly two pages long.
</P>
<P>
   ``TV. VCR. My own phone with caller ID. My own phone line. All
the Spice Girls stuff at the Icing. New covers for my bed. Brandy's
``Never Say Never'' CD. ``Mulan. Dr. Doolittle'' soundtrack ...''
</P>
<P>
   So I ask her, ``If you don't believe Santa exists, what must I
do with such a long list?''
</P>
<P>
   She throws herself on my bed, a big smile across her face and
says, ``Well, I kinda believe, and I kinda don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, she kinda doesn't believe in the Easter Bunny and the
Tooth Fairy, either, but she cries if the bunny isn't bearing just
the right gifts and the dear old fairy forgets to pay.
</P>
<P>
   And so as I write this, I hope it isn't so. I hope Jamila really
does believe in Santa Claus and is just spouting off, as she so
often does. I hope that she's just trying to appear grown-up to her
little sister.
</P>
<P>
   Of course if you believe the experts, this is it for Asha as
well. Come Feb. 19, she'll be 8, perhaps joining the other skeptics
out there.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know; maybe I just need to indulge the magic, to hold
fast to the kind of childlike faith believing in Santa requires.
</P>
<P>
   For it is this kind of childlike faith that I think should
permeate the whole Christmas season. Not because of Santa, but
because of Christ's birth and what that means.
</P>
<P>
   You see, I love the blessing and mystery that are Christmas. I
like that it represents the fulfillment of prophecy, the birth of
the Messiah. And what could be more mysterious than a virgin giving
birth? What could be a more perfect gift to us all? What, indeed,
requires more faith?
</P>
<P>
   I know that for many, the holiday has become more about
business, more about trees and lights, but for me it remains the
most enchanting time of the year, when gift-giving takes on a whole
other meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a religious context, the focus of the Christmas season
often becomes little more than a baby in a manger and wise men who
traveled for more than a year to present their gifts of gold,
frankincense and myrrh. The true essence, though, is ``God with
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Santa Claus or not, that's a gift, through faith, worth
celebrating.
</P>
<P>
   And the best part of all is that it costs nothing and means
everything.

THIS IS A PROBLEM FOR MISS MANNERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: My gripe is when a friend or relative decides
to jazz up one's computer. After my son and daughter-in-law came
for a few days at Thanksgiving, they left my computer in shambles.
I liked my old screen saver, but now have exotic fish swimming
around. The computer keeps locking up every few minutes, and I
can't find half the icons. Anyway, if you ever have any leftover
space, you might gently tell people to keep their cotton-pickin'
hooks off other people's toys.
</P>
<P>
   _ Grumpy
</P>
<P>
   DEAR GRUMPY: Maybe your kid is finally getting even with you for
making him take down that Ozzy Osbourne poster and get a haircut.
</P>
<P>
   Irritating, isn't it? I'm sure he meant well, but I'm afraid he
suffers from geekomania, the irresistible urge to show how much he
knows about computers by helping bring other, less-enlightened
people out of the Dark Ages so they may worship at his Rockports
(the official shoe of nerds everywhere).
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's painful to watch others around me struggle along
with 6-month-old technology when I know I could upgrade their
software with something newer and totally unnecessary. I fight that
urge. Your kid just needs to learn how to be happy with slapping
his forehead and grinning bemusedly whenever he sees some addled
stick-in-the-mud still using last month's version of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   You can get even, though. Go to his place for Christmas, and
help him out by reprogramming his VCR, rewiring his audio system
and tuning up his Beamer. Oh, and don't forget to ask him why he's
not making more money and living in a better neighborhood. It
should be a yule to remember.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I had a problem in Win95 and had to format the
hard drive and start over. My Win95 is on a CD. When I tried to
reinstall it, it said ``insufficient drive.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Computer Killer
</P>
<P>
   DEAR KILLER: No, ``insufficient drive'' is what my supervisor
noted on my latest performance review. I think you're talking about
``invalid drive.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a nice little gotcha, isn't it? Sometimes, the only way
out of a computer fiasco is to wipe the hard drive and start over.
Unfortunately, when you do that you also wipe out the drivers that
make the CD-ROM drive operate. Gotcha!
</P>
<P>
   In the closing-the-barn-door department, there are two things
you should have done. First, you could have used the master disk
creation utility included with some computers. It lets you churn
out a 29-diskette set of Windows, perfect for your situation. You
generally get that utility only when the Windows CD isn't included
with the computer, though.
</P>
<P>
   Second, you should have made a bootable disk with CD drivers.
You'd think Microsoft would give you an easy way to do that,
wouldn't you? Silly you! You can make a start-up disk (in
Add/Remove Programs), but you still have to add the drivers. Save
yourself the trouble. Get somebody with 95 to format a disk, making
sure to add system files so it's bootable. Get somebody else to
make you a Win98 start-up disk. Copy everything from the Win98 disk
except Command.com, Drvspace.bin, Io.sys and Msdos.sys to the 95
disk. Boot with the sucker, and you'll see the CD.

PARENTS' PORTFOLIO DUE   FOR DRAMATIC CHANGES

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I hope you might provide some guidance with my mother's
investments.
</P>
<P>
   She is in her mid-seventies and relatively healthy. My father,
however, has Alzheimer's disease and is in a nursing home costing
approximately $40,000 a year. Their annual income from Social
Security and my father's pension is $31,000. Their home is paid
for.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the cost of the nursing home, expenses are $15,000 a
year. Their investments consist of $120,020 in Fidelity Growth and
Income fund, $61,780 in Vanguard Windsor II, $33,500 in Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter, and a $10,000 CD paying 5.7 percent. In order
to best protect them from the ravages of long-term health care,
what do you suggest be dome with these investments?
</P>
<P>
   B.P., Solana Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Q. My advice would be to make some very dramatic changes in this
portfolio. My guess is that this was put together at a time when
your father was in good health, and at a time when your parents'
Social Security and pension were more than ample to provide for
their living expenses. Thus they viewed this portfolio as emergency
savings, and with any luck most likely to become a major part of
their estate. With that in mind, the preponderance was invested in
stock funds, to provide long-term growth. (I can't give you
portfolio percentages, because you don't specify which of the many
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter funds is represented by that $33,500
position.) At present. there's a $24,000 shortfall between your
parents' expenses and their income.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve such an income stream from an investment portfolio
would require an 11.2 percent return, a level which you are
unlikely to achieve without making extremely risky investments.
What you want instead of risky investments is a conservative
income-oriented portfolio designed to produce a highest income
level and represent prudent risk-avoidance.
</P>
<P>
   If you were to invest the entire $225,480 in a portfolio of
fixed-income holdings which produced an average portfolio return of
6.5 percent, taking withdrawals of $2,000 a month, the pool would
last 14 1/4 years -- not long enough so that you can be confident
that the investment pool will outlast your parents, but still a
good chuck of time. Moreover, if worst came to worst, there's also
that potentially substantial asset represented by your parents'
unmortgaged home. I do not suggest you make any immediate move
there, since your mother has already undergone many unpleasant
changes resulting from your father's illness. But on the other
hand, if the situation hasn't changed in about five years, you
might want to consider the consequences of a sale. Just as an
example, if you were to follow the sequence of withdrawals outlined
above for five years, your principal would fall to a value of
$167,999. If your mother were then to sell her house, netting
$200,000 from the sale and adding that amount to the savings pool,
she would then have $367,999. If you were to then increase the
withdrawal sequence to $3,000 a month, allowing her to add $1,000 a
month in rent to her expenses, the pool would then last a further
16.4 years -- or 21.4 years from now.
</P>
<P>
   As for the investments, I'd suggest 30 percent in CDs, money
markets and short-term bond funds, 50 percent in a good GNMA (or
Ginnie Mae) fund, and the remainder in a high-yield (or junk) bond
fund. You can build such a portfolio with solid no-load funds
available from either Fidelity or Vanguard.
</P>
<P>
   If any of your parents' savings are in tax-deferred accounts
such as IRAs or 401(k)s, there would be no tax consequences of
changing the portfolio. If not, you might be well advised to
consult a tax expert to determine the likely tax consequences, and
how you should time the sale of the stock funds. Your father's
deductible health care costs should offset some or all of the
capital gains you realize, and you could probably further reduce
the tax effects by spreading the stock fund sales between this year
and next -- but a tax expert who knows all the details of the
situation would have to determine the specifics.

   Q. I'm a 22-year-old in the U.S. Marine Corps and have been
investing for nearly one year, putting $100 a month into
Oppenheimer Main Street Income and Growth fund, Class B. I now have
about $1,100. I know this isn't much time, but I decided to start
investing with what I could afford. I plan to put in my 20 years in
the service, and during that time to continue investing in mutual
funds with what I can afford, with a goal of someday reaching
$500,000. Am I on the right track? Also, I have an additional $50 a
month to invest.
</P>
<P>
   Where do you suggest I put it?
</P>
<P>
   P.B., Oceanside, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. You have made a terrific start, and the main thing you need
at this point is the discipline to keep plugging away at it,
through markets sweet and sour. Resist any temptations to hold back
investments when everything's plunging on Wall Street, and also
keep plugging away when the market seems so high that it seems
impossible that it might go higher and time soon. Remember, you're
in for the long haul, and what seems expensive today should seem
very cheap indeed when viewed ten years from now.
</P>
<P>
   So how realistic is that $500,000 target? Well, let's guess that
your Marine Corps hitch has 19 years to go; if you were to keep up
the $100-a-month discipline for the next 19 years, and if your
portfolio achieved average annual gains of 10 percent during that
period, you would have $70,934. If you were to simply quit saving
at that point and leave the accounts alone for the next 20 years,
the portfolio's internal growth would take it to $477,208 by the
time you are 61. If you continued the $100-a-month contributions
after you leave the Marine Corps and maintained that pace until age
61, the accumulation would then be $549,091. Finally, of you were
to bump the contributions up to $150 a month now and maintain that
pace for 19 years, you would have $103,037 at the time of your
first retirement. That amount, left alone with no contributions,
would grow to $693,181 during the next 20 years; if you continued
making $150 monthly contributions until age 61, you'd have $801,005
at that time.
</P>
<P>
   Oppenheimer Main Street Income and Growth is a fine fund for
beginning your program, and unless something about the fund
radically changes, it should be an excellent fund to treat as your
core holding for the long term. Ultimately you'll want your core
holding to represent about 40 to 60 percent of the total portfolio,
with the balance spread out among various other sectors such as
mid-cap, small-cap, overseas, and health care funds. I suggest you
let the core position grow to a critical mass before you begin
diversifying. After about two years, I'd suggest you begin to build
the four minor portfolio themes. If I were doing it, I'd set an
eventual goal of having 50 percent in Main Street Income and Growth
and 12.5 percent in each of the positions you've chosen for
diversification. As for the choice of funds for the smaller market
positions, that answer is easy; don't worry about it until it's
necessary, in about two years.

   Q. My wife's mother recently passed away, leaving us with a
$150,000 nest egg. My wife thinks I'm a smart guy and wants me to
invest it for us. It's kind of a big responsibility and I'm really
not as smart as she thinks. My neighbor who is a financial planner
says just stick it in a couple of good mutual funds and forget
about it. But I like your advice to average the investment over a
period of three years. I guess I'm a little confused about what
funds to use and how much to invest at a time. We are reasonably
debt-free, with a few thousand dollars in a money market accounts
and our home will be paid off in four years. I am 73 and my wife is
67. What do you suggest?
</P>
<P>
   D.C., Newport Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, I still like dollar cost averaging for buying stock
funds, but I'm not sure that at your age I would be putting a whole
lot of my eggs in that basket. In fact, I suggest that you put no
more than 40 percent of the inheritance, or $60,000 in stock funds,
and I'd take a cowardly course there, both through picking
conservative funds and by adopting three- year dollar cost
averaging. Presuming you put that $60,000 in a money market fund
earning 5 percent, this would entail 36 monthly transfers of $1,850
from the money fund to the stock fund.
</P>
<P>
   What funds? I'd suggest that you use three different funds with
stock-dominated portfolios. I'll cite funds within the Vanguard
family, but you can find similar offerings with most of the major
mutual fund groups. I'd put half of this money, or $30,000, into
Vanguard Index Value. Then I'd target $15,000 each for Vanguard
Balanced Index and Vanguard Specialized Health Care funds.
</P>
<P>
   As for the balance of the inheritance, I'd suggest another
$60,000 go into Vanguard GNMA, and $15,000 each into Vanguard
Short-Term Corporate Bond and Vanguard High-Yield Corporate Bond
funds. With these $90,000 in fixed-income fund investments, I
suggest you go ahead with lump-sum investments. Dollar cost
averaging is fine for the more volatile stock funds, but when
you're in the tamer world of bond investing, I think the practice
is unduly cautious.

THE SYSTEM LED TO A NIGHTMARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   She was driving a red Dodge Caravan with a pair of child seats
in the back, a typically harried young mother dashing from work to
the supermarket on Thanksgiving eve.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the law reached back seven years into Sonia
Hernandez's past to collect a debt she thought she had long since
paid. She only owed money, a couple of hundred dollars at that.
What authorities took were her dignity and sense of self.
</P>
<P>
   Her tale begins back in 1991, out on Route 24 in Randolph,
Mass., on a ride between a Quincy party and her Brockton home. She
was pulled over by a State Police trooper, registered a 0.14 on the
breath test, and pleaded guilty in court. According to records, she
paid a $250 fine, surrendered her license for 45 days, attended an
alcohol-awareness course, and entered probation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was drinking,'' she says, sitting in the living room of her
apartment in Boston, recalling that long-ago arrest. ``And it was
my fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Flash ahead to 5:10 p.m. on this recent Wednesday. She's the
mother of four now, making her way in life, a medical technician
who dreams of becoming a nurse. For reasons unknown, her minivan
caught the attention of Boston Officer Dave Roberto, a 15-year
veteran. He ran her plate, saw an outstanding warrant in her name,
and pulled her to the side of the road.
</P>
<P>
   A second police car arrived, then another. Picture this:
Hernandez, 38, looking nothing if not maternal, ordered out of her
car, hysterical on the street, wondering what will become of her
10-month-old and 12-year-old daughters in day care and her
14-year-old and 5-year-old sons at home. She pleaded with the
officers that she had paid her fine, that she's had a clean record
ever since. The response: Tell it to the judge.
</P>
<P>
   By then, she had descended into a Kafkaesque bureaucratic and
legal hell from which there was, quite literally, no escape. There
wasn't any judge, either, not until Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   A bondsman told Hernandez she could not post bail because the
mystery warrant was out of Quincy District Court, a different
jurisdiction. Police led Hernandez from the station and drove her
to the Nashua Street jail. She was searched, told to strip, and
given canvas prison clothes. There were no open cells, so
authorities put her in a communal lockup. She was forced to use a
toilet in partial view of male guards. She slept on a metal bench.
Someone, anyone, could have called an on-duty judge to request
bail, but no one apparently thought it worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   On Thanksgiving Day, the guards put her in the television
lounge, where she spent hours sobbing, unsure why she was there.
Her children sat home asking other relatives where their mother had
gone. ``It was terrible,'' she says. ``My daughter cried for two
days. She thought I was never getting out of jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Before dawn Friday, someone screamed into her lockup that it was
time to get up. Guards handcuffed her wrists to those of another
woman and drove them to Quincy court. Just when you think things
can't get any worse, they do. Court officers shackled her legs and
made her shuffle before the judge.
</P>
<P>
   So what started as a simple shopping trip to the neighborhood Hi
Lo on Centre Street ends in a tear-streaked appearance before a
judge in Quincy Center. That judge, a decent man named Charles
Black, informed her she owed $230 in monthly probation costs from
1991 that she had never paid. Hernandez's boyfriend, sitting in
court, paid the fee, and she was free at last.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez says she doesn't recall being billed for any monthly
probation costs, and points out that she had been handed back her
license so many years ago by a probation officer who could have
withheld it for the fee. She has also renewed her license since.
But even if she had just ignored the $230 bill, even if she was at
fault, did the punishment fit the crime?
</P>
<P>
   To that question, the system offers only a collective shrug.
Police say it doesn't matter that Hernandez didn't appear criminal
or drunk. The arresting officer could only see from the warrant
that she violated probation, officials said, and in this litigious
day and age, cops can't afford to look the other way.``We're at a
distinct disadvantage. We have to be more than cautious,'' says
Sergeant Margot Hill, a Boston police spokeswoman. ``If we let her
go, would she be drinking? Would she be drunk with kids in the
car?''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's easy to believe Hernandez when she says she never
knew about the fee, easy to believe that the bureaucracy never
informed her of the tab. Here's why: The day after Thanksgiving,
Hernandez's license and registration, confiscated at the scene,
were nowhere to be found. At the police station, at the jail, at
the courthouse, everyone told her it wasn't their fault.

in some small way, about feeding your self-esteem.' ''

   P.S. How do you spot a trend? The year-end Futurist suggests:
``Follow the Yellow Page headings'' (aging demographics, for
example, has resulted in categories for pain management and day

activity (such as thrifting, the increasing hunting for bargains at
thrift shops); and ``Think in opposites'' because ``Behind every
trend there is a countertrend.''

   TV-TEMPEST (Undated) _ Though hardly a disaster, NBC's
``Tempest'' Sunday night is a morality play that works well for an
hour or so, and then begins to crumble in an allegorical war story
that is more confusing than enlightening. NBC is resting its hopes
here on Peter Fonda, who brings to ``The Tempest'' the quiet
intensity that got him an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of a

OAKLAND STADIUM STANDS AS A WARNING TO HARTFORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nothing is deterring Governor John Rowland and the Connecticut
Legislature from heading into the red-tape district of the National
Football League. Not even a report by the state's Office of Fiscal
Analysis that says the new Hartford stadium for the New England
Patriots could cost taxpayers up to $257 million over 30 years. Nor
an insane clause that would make taxpayers pay up to $17.5 million
a year for unsold luxury boxes.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature has scheduled a special session next Tuesday to
finalize its $375 million, taxpayer-funded colossus. The
politicians are getting ready to walk up the stairs with the
fluttering heartbeat of anticipation of what awaits them in the
skybox. History shows they instead will be walking back down to the
street with the look of suckers who had their lust momentarily
satisfied but realize when they try to hail a cab that they had
been pickpocketed by the prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Rowland says the stadium will ``guarantee the success''
of downtown development in Hartford. He calls it the ``turning
point that will propel this state into the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland's lights are clearly out, guaranteeing a mansion and
income for a fabulously wealthy owner and 40 or so incredibly
salaried athletes while many of the state's 73,000 low-income
students go to dilapidated public school buildings that might as
well be homeless shelters.
</P>
<P>
   If one looks at what happened in Oakland, Calif., Rowland's
claims of success are massive displays of ignorance. In the early
1980s, Oakland lost the Raiders to Los Angeles. Oakland, a city as
tired of being an afterthought to San Francisco as Hartford is to
Boston and New York, has been desperate for some show of civic
testosterone, a show that says, ``We got game.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakland got the game and got gamed. In order to lure them back
in the mid 1990s, the city paid the Raiders $70 million up front
just to come to Oakland and promised $100 million in renovations to
the stadium the team had fled.
</P>
<P>
   Like Hartford, Oakland agreed to grandiose schemes of revenue
guarantees for the team. In Oakland's case, it agreed to pick up
any unsold ``personal seat licenses,'' the bizarre fee in which a
Raiders fan would pay between $250 and $4,000 merely for the right
to purchase a season ticket.
</P>
<P>
   When this was all announced, many people fell for the scheme. A
headline for a 1995 San Francisco Chronicle news story said, ``Why
the Raiders are a bargain for Oakland.'' The story said Oakland's
deal with the Raiders, when compared with the deals in other cities
that had thrown massive sums of taxpayer money at NFL teams, ``is
the only one to even attempt to pay for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   In its lust, Oakland never accounted for reality. This city,
laden with a high poverty rate and a team too mediocre on the field
to draw wealthy fans from afar, never came close to selling out. To
maintain its guarantees to Davis, the city now pays the Raiders $16
million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Sufficiently awakened to the horrors of the deal, a 1997
editorial in the Chronicle called it ``a time-release toxin.'' Mary
King, Alameda County supervisor and head of the stadium authority,
said: ``It was an unfortunate transaction in terms of the
expectations set up publicly. It is a mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartford similarly is in no position to guarantee revenues.
Hartford, like Oakland, has a high poverty rate. It is two hours
from Boston and two hours closer to New York, which already has the
Giants and the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Boosters of the Hartford deal anticipate luring corporations in
the Connecticut suburbs of New York to the skyboxes. It might
happen when the Patriots are winning, but fat cats will be the
first to stay away during losing cycles. This would seem to be an
important consideration, given that a Hartford Courant story last
month said, ``No one believes there is enough corporate clout in
Greater Hartford to fill all the premium seating.''
</P>
<P>
   No one should believe any of Rowland's promises that the stadium
will not scorch the taxpayers, even if the state gets out of
guaranteeing luxury seat revenues to Kraft. It has not happened in
recent memory. St. Louis taxpayers will end up paying $720 million
for the Rams, three times its annual budget for public schools.
Even though most of its 81 games are sold out or heavily attended,
Baltimore subsidizes the recently built stadium for the Orioles to
the tune of $11 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   No one should believe any promises about jobs. Sports stadiums
are one of the most inefficient ways to produce jobs. Studies show
the new baseball stadium in Cleveland cost the city $230,000 per
new job created. The Orioles stadium cost between $127,000 to
$331,000 per job. It costs Maryland only $6,250 per person to
generate jobs out of its economic development agency.
</P>
<P>
   The lights will shine on the ugliness of Connecticut's deal with
the Patriots sooner or later. The problem for the taxpayers is that
it will almost certainly be too late. Tuesday, the Legislature
walks up the stairs. The politicians will emerge from the doors
smiling as if they made the big score. Just do not ask them
afterwards for taxi fare.

   In preparation for the year's end, the Trends Research Institute
has named the year's ``Trend Losers,'' among them  &UR; Bill &LR; 
 &UR; Gates &LR; , Nike, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, ``Good
Morning America'' and Nabisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a desperate attempt to stop the crumbling sales of its
SnackWell cookies,'' says the Institute, ``Nabisco pitched them to
women as an ego booster. `At SnackWells,' said one ad, `we like to
think that snacking shouldn't be just about feeding yourself, but,
in some small way, about feeding your self-esteem.' ''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. How do you spot a trend? The year-end Futurist suggests:
``Follow the Yellow Page headings'' (aging demographics, for
example, has resulted in categories for pain management and day
spas); ``Watch for nouns being used as verbs, hinting at increased
activity (such as thrifting, the increasing hunting for bargains at
thrift shops); and ``Think in opposites'' because ``Behind every
trend there is a countertrend.''

IN PUERTO RICO, STORM FOLLOWS A STORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UTAUDO, Puerto Rico _ Along the banks of the Rio Grande de
Arecibo, gigantic sewer pipes lay strewn on the buckled road. Three
dogs _ either lost or abandoned by their owners _ lapped up rice
and beans from a Styrofoam container.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three months after Hurricane Georges ripped through
Puerto Rico, the devastation is still obvious in rural areas like
this mountainside village, where the storm flattened dozens of
pastel-colored concrete houses.
</P>
<P>
   Walking along the ruins this week, Carlos Torres Vera surveyed
his crumbling home, but his anger was not directed at nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government keeps talking about the plebiscite, as if this
never happened,'' said Torres, a middle-aged manleaning on a cane.
``We didn't want this plebiscite. Not now. We're suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   This Sunday, Puerto Ricans will head to the polls to vote on the
status of their homeland, showing whether they prefer to become a
US state or remain a US commonwealth, among other choices. And for
the first time in its 100-year history as a US territory, the
statehood option is expected to win.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico Governor Pedro Rossello, an ardent statehood
supporter who pushed for the plebiscite, hopes the results will
spur Congress to authorize a binding plebiscite that would settle
once and for all the political fate of the island and its 3.9
million residents.
</P>
<P>
   The issues of political sovereignty may seem remote from the
destruction in Utuado. But in Puerto Rico, where nationalism and
cultural pride reign, and where people may be more passionate about
politics than even Bostonians, everyone has a strong opinion _
especially hurricane victims who feel betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want us to become a state, that's for sure,'' said Luz
Celeste Negron Rivera, 29, who is living in a shelter with her
husband and seven children.
</P>
<P>
   Negron, like many Puerto Ricans living in the central part of
the island, is pro-commonwealth. Like many hurricane victims who
live in quaint mountainside towns, miles from larger, more
Americanized cities, she believes Rossello pushed for the
plebiscite in the storm's aftermath, hoping that voters like her
won't be able to get to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like what he's doing,'' she said of the governor.
``He's not helping us. It's like he wants to force statehood. He's
putting us up against a wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Negron wants to vote, but she lost everything, including her
identification, when the storm tore her house apart, leaving behind
just parts of the bathroom. Besides, she and her husband, Felix
Oquendo, need to find a home.
</P>
<P>
   For now, home is a former office of the Bernardo Gonzalez Middle
School in Utuado, a squat concrete building. It's been converted
into a shelter for 148 people who say they are lucky the five
bathrooms they share have running water. Negron's children, who
lost all their toys, chased other kids in the asphalt parking lot
under swaying palm trees.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in her school uniform _ a plaid skirt and green shirt _
Negron's 5-year-old daughter Diana ran to her mother and began
tugging at her hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mommy, can we have a party?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, sweetheart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What about a house?''
</P>
<P>
   Negron stared stoically into the distance, brushing her long
brown hair from her sweaty face.
</P>
<P>
   When Hurricane Georges hit Puerto Rico on Sept. 20, it turned
the Rio Grande de Arecibo into a freight train that swept along
trees and stones.
</P>
<P>
   All over this lush island, people still suffer from the storm,
which destroyed more than 20,000 homes, severely damaged 36,000
others, and caused untold billions of dollars in damage.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Edmonston, a spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, said more than $1 billion has been spent so far on aid and
loans to families whose homes were destroyed. But each day that
figure rises as people file paperwork for loans and assistance.
</P>
<P>
   FEMA's job is to help residents make their homes habitable,
Edmonston said. But downpours in October and nearly three straight
weeks of rain recently have hampered progress.
</P>
<P>
   The rain hasn't stopped the political hype, however. It's hard
to escape the barrage of plebiscite-related commercials on
television and radio. On busy roads, political caravans led by
police on motorcycles snake across the island. In Bayamon, the
pro-statehood New Progressive Party blocked traffic Wednesday night
as a jingle blared from large speakers: ``Vote for your future!
Vote for statehood!''
</P>
<P>
   Along the main streets of Utuado, posters and banners relating
to ``El Plebescito'' hang from telephone poles, stores, and
restaurants. ``Con estadidad puedo ganar,'' reads one sign. (With
statehood I can win). Others say ``Vota por Ninguna,'' or ``none of
the above.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, construction crews work hurriedly for fear of more
rain.
</P>
<P>
   Big-wheel trucks rumbled down the road that snakes past Adelphia
Saloon, a cafe that owner Filiberto LaFontaine named for the city
he once lived in _ Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Like many roadside stores, it offers everything from milk to
candy to freshly killed chickens. Roosters walking freely along the
road crowed as LaFontaine watched the backhoes, bulldozers, and
dump trucks roll by.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're spending millions to publicize the plebiscite,''
LaFontaine said. ``Why is the government spending millions on a
campaign when they can house hundreds of people with that same
money?''
</P>
<P>
   He thanks God that his home was not destroyed, but he and his
wife have not had running water since the storm. Every few days,
they fill plastic drums with water from a spring several miles
away. ``This plebiscite was like the hurricane,'' he said. ``We
were unable to stop it.''

WHAT WRITERS WOULD HAVE YOU READ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the years, I have been asking writers: If I could read just
one of your books, which one would you have me read? I view it as
an intellectual economy measure. You can't read everything; why not
read the best?
</P>
<P>
   Some authors bridle at The Question, as did Richard Dooling,
author of several novels, including the brilliant black comedy
``Critical Care.'' My books are like my children, this response
goes. How can I be asked to choose among them?
</P>
<P>
   Well, OK. But books aren't children. Men can't create children,
just for starters, and it is the self-deluding parent who thinks he
or she loves all offspring in the same way. So, anticipating the
Dooling Demurrer, I approached one of my favorite authors, Geoffrey
Wolff, and told him he had to choose a favorite.
</P>
<P>
   One would assume (dangerous to assume!) that Wolff would pick
``The Duke of Deception,'' his memoir of his father that is one of
the great nonfiction works of recent years. Failing that, he'd call
out his delightful Harry Crosby biography ``Black Sun,'' or the
grim ``Providence,'' a novel set in that city.
</P>
<P>
   But no. ``I'd have you read `A Day at the Beach,' a collection
of personal essays that go _ all too literally _ to the heart of my
passions,'' Wolff e-mailed me. ``Because they mark a welcome
farewell to solipsism, I have a perhaps too tender regard for those
circumstances and acts from my life that I have willed into
narrative form, from times in my life when I _ and not my mommy or
daddy _ can be held wholly accountable for those circumstances and
acts.''
</P>
<P>
   Does first book (EQ) first love? Sometimes. Columbia historian
Alan Brinkley has written several books and textbooks since his
first published work, ``Voices of Protest: Huey Long, Father
Coughlin and the Great Depression.'' But it remains his favorite,
``even though I wrote it so long ago (1982) it seems almost as if
it were the work of someone else.'' Likewise George Higgins, now
working on his 30th book, would have you read his first published
novel, ``The Friends of Eddie Coyle'': ``It would have to be that
book, because without `Eddie Coyle,' you wouldn't know me from a
load of goat.''
</P>
<P>
   Justin Kaplan, who has written biographies of Walt Whitman and
Lincoln Steffens, also prefers to stick with his first love, Mark
Twain. Of 1967's ``Mr. Clemens and Mark Twain,'' he writes: ``Its
subject, to use a chilling word, was a prodigy and an absolute
original _ dazzling, ferocious, vulnerable, utterly winning,
invariably quotable. Mark Twain may have been a representative
American, but he was more unlike anybody else than anybody else I
can think of. As you see, I'm still pretty fond of the book. . . .
''
</P>
<P>
   There must be a temptation to name one's current (i.e.,
revenue-producing) book as the must-read tome, as novelist Anne
Bernays did when when I popped her The Question a number of years
ago. She referred me to ``Professor Romeo,'' which I liked a lot.
(Her neighbor, Henry Louis Gates Jr., sent me to ``Colored People''
_ excellent.) About the same time, Simon Schama's ``Citizens,'' a
chatty history of the French Revolution, was in the stores. But
Schama said his best book of the three he had then published was
``An Embarrassment of Riches: An Interpretation of Dutch Culture in
the Golden Age.'' I bet it's great; I haven't read it.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, some writers' choices depend on readers' responses.
The prolific poet and prose writer Donald Hall cites his
book-length poem, ``The One Day,'' which won the 1988 National Book
Critics Circle Award. ``It may well be true that I list it as my
favorite because many people whom I admire or trust claim that it
is my best thing,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago I bearded John Irving with The Question.
Irving spends five or six years on each of his novels, and takes
enormous pride in his work. I wasn't carrying a notebook, and I
can't remember his precise response. (He mentioned more than one
book, and ``The World According to Garp'' wasn't one of them.) But
I do recall one detail. His mother had said his best book was ``A
Prayer for Owen Meany,'' and, all things being equal, he wasn't
inclined to disagree with her.

REGULATORS CRACK DOWN ON DAY-TRADING FIRMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By Steve Bailey and Steven Syre  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Massachusetts to the day-trading firms: Clean up your act or be
gone.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, for the third time in six weeks, state regulators
moved against a day-trading firm, this time filing charges against
All-Tech Investment Group, one of the most prominent firms in the
high-tech arm of the brokerage business that has boomed with the
bull market.
</P>
<P>
   But All-Tech's Harvey Houtkin, long a guru of day trading, made
it clear that he had no intention of rolling over for Massachusetts
regulators. ``They are looking to put themselves on the map, and
they are doing it with day trading,'' said Houtkin. ``What they
have charged is nothing short of lunacy.''
</P>
<P>
   In an administrative complaint, the state securities division
charged the firm and its executives with a range of abuses. Among
them: forgery; deceptive marketing designed to make clients believe
they were likely to make profits; trading customer accounts without
authorization; creating phony accounts; and misleading state
examiners.
</P>
<P>
   Day trading has gained in popularity the past few years by
catering to individual investors who buy and sell stocks over
sophisticated computers systems at the firms' offices.
</P>
<P>
   Day traders make rapid-fire transactions, holding a stock for as
little as a minute or two, looking to make one-eighth or
one-quarter point _ 12.5 cents or 25 cents _ on a stock and then
hopefully bailing out with a profit.
</P>
<P>
   The apostles of day trading paint themselves as Robin Hoods,
providing small investors with the same technology and access to
the markets available to the giant over-the-counter market makers
at places like Merrill Lynch and Goldman, Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Wall Street establishment considers these guerrilla
market makers outlaws and says they are using the technology to
distort the system; some regulators have worried that
unsophisticated investors are playing a fool's game.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Massachusetts regulators are way out ahead on the issue
or all by themselves, depending on your point of view.
</P>
<P>
   In October, the state's securities division brought a
first-in-the-nation complaint against Houston-based Block Trading
Inc., a now-defunct day-trading firm that operated an office in
Boston and relished its reputation as ``The Bad Boys of Wall
Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later the division filed a complaint against another
firm, Las Vegas-based Bright Trading Inc., which has an office in
Hingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday it weighed in against All-Tech. Similar complaints are
expected against other firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want day traders if they are going to act like
this,'' said Secretary of State William Galvin, who oversees the
securities division.
</P>
<P>
   Other regulators have been far less alarmed by day trading.
David Shellenberger, the chief of licensing for the state
securities division, is heading a day-trading study group for the
North American Securities Administrators Association, but has yet
to make any recommendations. The Securities and Exchange Commission
is not currently looking at day trading, a spokesman said Thursday.
No other state regulator has filed a complaint.
</P>
<P>
   That may be about to change in the wake of the Massachusetts
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, home of a number of day-trading firms, the state's
securities chief says her office is investigating several firms and
expects to file charges. ``Day trading is hugely popular,'' said
Denise Voigt Crawford. ``It is so popular you could call it the
cool thing to do or an epidemic, depending on your perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``It is possible to do this legitimately, although
that is extremely rare. Almost every day-trading firm we have gone
into has had problems, most of the time serious problems.''
</P>
<P>
   In the All-Tech case, Massachusetts regulators say the company
``conveyed the impression that investors are likely to achieve
profits,'' while minimizing the risks. They outlined examples of
how executives at All-Tech's Watertown office allegedly forged
clients' signatures and co-mingled client funds. Some clients lost
tens of thousands of dollars, they said. The state is seeking to
revoke All-Tech's right to do business in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Nestor, chief of the state's securities division, said his
primary concern was that investors understand the risk. He said 67
of the 68 clients at the Block Trading office in Boston lost money;
the one investor who made money had close personal ties to the
branch manager, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can buy lottery tickets or go to a casino if they want
because they understand those risks,'' Nestor said. ``Securities
laws demand that brokerage firms disclose all risks to potential
investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Houtkin, the All-Tech executive, was outraged Thursday by the
state securities division's action, complaining that reporters had
a copy of the complaint even before his firm had seen it.
</P>
<P>
   He said if there was a problem in Watertown, Mass., one of 25
All-Tech offices, he wanted to fix it.
</P>
<P>
   Whether investors made money or lost money wasn't the point,
Houtkin said. ``We provide market information and direct access to
the market. What people do with that information and access is an
individual thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Marcus, head of the finance department at Boston College's
Carroll School of Management, called day trading dangerous, but he
questioned how much regulators should do to protect investors from
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on how paternalistic you want to be,'' said Marcus.
``I would be pretty unhappy if my kids were out day trading. It's a
loser's game. Most sophisticated people know it generally won't be
profitable. On the other hand, it's probably a better chance than
playing the lottery and Massachusetts isn't stopping that.''

BOOK BORK, MEET YOUR EVIL TWIN, BROWSER BORK 
</HEADLINE>
  By MICHAEL KINSLEY 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The problem is Microsoft's tactics in maintaining their
(monopoly), which included an attempt to crush Netscape. You recall
in that meeting ... they were pretty rough and they threatened.
Marc Andreessen, the technical man from Netscape, said later that
it was like a visit from Don Corleone. He expected to find a bloody
computer screen in his bed in the morning.''--Robert Bork,
interviewed on CNN (1998)
</P>
<P>
   ``Unsophisticated theories of predation abound, leading to
drastic overestimations of its likelihood. The most common 'theory'
views firms in the market as if they were thugs in a dark alley;
evidently a large firm has more muscle and can beat smaller firms
to death. ... Such remarks, though they represent popular
'learning' on the subject, do not reflect theory but are only
foolishly inapposite metaphors that ignore the constraints the
market places upon firm behavior.''--Robert Bork, The Antitrust
Paradox (1978)
</P>
<P>
   My college freshman roommate thought he was trapped with a
madman when I asked, the first day, where you went to pick up the
free light bulbs. He had never heard of free light bulbs. Growing
up in Detroit, I had never heard of paying for them. Detroit Edison
gave away free light bulbs until 1978, when an antitrust lawsuit
forced them to stop.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, Robert Bork published The Antitrust Paradox,
asking again and again questions such as why the law should stop a
company from doing consumers the favor of giving them something for
free. Conservative commentators--permanently embittered, like Bork
himself, by the 1987 battle that kept him off the Supreme
Court--often describe Bork as the towering constitutional
philosopher of our century. That is unlikely. Except for a
published lecture series, he has never written a scholarly book on
constitutional law. On antitrust law, though, he wrote the book.
</P>
<P>
   The antitrust statutes are very short--just a few vague and
badly worded sentences. But mountains of doctrine had been built on
them over the decades by judges, most of whom were innocent of
economics. Bork's book argued that much, if not most, antitrust law
was economic nonsense. The law protected competitors rather than
protecting competition. It punished behavior that was economically
efficient and good for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   When I graduated from law school, also in 1978, every firm on my
job hunt had a big antitrust department. But thanks largely to
Bork's book--plus 12 years of Republican judicial appointments and
Justice Departments--antitrust law melted away. Huge companies
merged without a peep of complaint. Judges trained in economics (or
with clerks who were trained in economics) reversed, ridiculed, or
simply ignored long-established antitrust doctrines.
</P>
<P>
   With the return of a Democratic administration in 1992,
antitrust began to return as well. But one reason the Microsoft
case is so contentious and confusing is that the law remains
uncertain. The edifice was torn down and now it's being rebuilt,
and no one can say for sure what it's going to look like. But the
government is arguing that giving away an Internet browser, like
giving away light bulbs, is or ought to be illegal. And Bork is on
the government's side. He doesn't renounce his influential book. He
insists he is being perfectly consistent.
</P>
<P>
   It's not utterly impossible to reconcile Bork's current position
(call it Browser Bork) with what he wrote in 1978 (call it Book
Bork), but it's almost utterly impossible. What is utterly
impossible is to imagine that Bork himself would ever have threaded
through this maze of rationalization if he weren't being paid by
Netscape. Bork told the Washington Post, somewhat amazingly, that
when Netscape first approached him, he said, ``I'm not sure my
philosophy fits your case.'' Then, the Post reports, ``the company
pointed him to Pages 344 and 345 of his seminal book,'' which
discuss a case so important to his theory that he'd apparently
forgotten all about it.
</P>
<P>
   The Post also reports, ``Bork rejects the notion that Netscape
is trading on his reputation,'' which if correct will do nothing
good for that reputation. Obviously Netscape is trading on his
reputation, just as Microsoft apparently tried to. No one needed
his analytical expertise. By Bork's own account, after all,
Netscape's supplicants had to point out his key argument to him.
</P>
<P>
   The case on Pages 344 and 345 of ``The Antitrust Paradox'' is
indeed the only thing in Bork's 462-page book that even faintly
supports his current position. It is called Lorain Journal v. U.S.
and dates from 1951. The monopoly newspaper in a small town refused
to sell advertising to anyone who also advertised on a newly
arrived radio station. The court ruled that was predatory and
illegal. Bork argues that various Microsoft practices amount to the
same thing. These include things like requiring computer makers who
license Windows to make the Windows desktop the first thing users
see, or insisting that online services must make Internet Explorer
their ``default'' browser if they want to customize it for their
users. He also includes here the bundling of Internet Explorer with
Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Problem No. 1 for Browser Bork is that Book Bork is not all that
enthusiastic for the Lorain case. He says that it ``seem(s) clearly
correct, and yet it is rather difficult to articulate the
distinction'' between Lorain and another case he also endorses that
reaches the opposite conclusion. The distinction, he wanly
suggests, ``probably lies in the fact that the court was offered
what was essentially an efficiency defense'' in the other case. By
contrast, ``There was no apparent efficiency justification'' for
the newspaper's refusal to sell ads. The central theme of ``The
Antitrust Paradox'' is that economic efficiency is key.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-BORK-SLATE-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: efficiency is key.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Problem No. 2 for Browser Bork is that the Microsoft case
differs from Lorain in obvious ways. First, the Microsoft tactics
that leverage Windows into this or that advantage for Internet
Explorer fall short of a classic ``refusal to deal.'' The direct
analogy to Lorain would be if Microsoft refused to sell Windows to
any computer maker that installed Netscape--which it has never
done. (The computer I write this on, like most, came with
Netscape.) Second, I'll leave to Microsoft's lawyers the
challenging argument that Windows does not have a monopoly on
operating systems. But Internet Explorer certainly doesn't have a
monopoly on browsers--it isn't even No. 1--so the policies that
attempt to impose conditions on the use of Internet Explorer, as
opposed to Windows, do not qualify as monopolistic behavior at all.
</P>
<P>
   Problem No. 3 is efficiency. Microsoft certainly has ``offered''
an efficiency defense for making its browser part of the operating
system and for the other challenged practices. And several possible
defenses are ``apparent'' just from reading Bork's book on pages
other than 344 and 345. Book Bork touts the economies in the
marketing and distribution of one product rather than two. And he
explains the importance of ``technological interdependence.'' (``If
the essential component did not conform to exact specifications, it
might impair the operation or usefulness of the principal
product.'') He repeats and repeats his point that any even
plausible efficiency argument should trump overblown concerns about
the dangers of monopolization. ``The truth appears to be that there
has never been a case in which exclusive dealing or requirements
contracts were shown to injure competition,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   The most ``apparent'' efficiency of a monopoly in operating
systems or a would-be monopoly in browsers is the notorious
``network effect.'' The more people who use a complicated piece of
software, the more useful it is to each user. Browser Bork
strangely classifies the network effect as an artificial barrier to
competition imposed by Microsoft, rather than a genuine benefit to
consumers (for which Microsoft deserves neither credit nor blame).
</P>
<P>
   Book Bork is contemptuous of arguments against ``tying
arrangements'' (making the customer buy two products together) and
against ``predatory pricing'' (lowering your price in order to
drive rivals out of business). How would the Bork of ``The
Antitrust Paradox'' have solved the great metaphysical riddle of
our time: Is Windows with Internet Explorer one product or two?
``Every product or service could be broken down into smaller
components capable of being sold separately. ... There is no way to
state the 'inherent' scope of a product.''
</P>
<P>
   Browser Bork does have an explanation of why tying arrangements,
a practice he considered harmless if not metaphysically impossible
in 1978, became dangerous in 1998. He says his 1978 argument
concerned the extension of a monopoly from one product to
another--which classical economics considers to be
impossible--whereas Microsoft is using a tying arrangement to
preserve the monopoly it's already got. This is puzzling. It will
be news to Bork's Netscape clients that the case isn't about
Microsoft attempting to use its monopoly in operating systems to
achieve a monopoly in browsers. Or is Bork suggesting that they're
actually one undifferentiable product--which is Microsoft's
position? Or is it that Microsoft is somehow leveraging its
nonmonopoly on browsers backward into the monopoly it already has
on operating systems?
</P>
<P>
   Bork is so famous for believing that predatory pricing is almost
impossible that he doesn't explicitly say, in his ``white paper''
for Netscape, that selling an Internet browser for zero dollars is
predatory. He does say Microsoft's ``clear intent'' in giving away
Internet Explorer is ``to drive Netscape out of the market'' and
that the ``effect upon the much smaller Netscape was devastating.''
He also makes the truly bizarre argument that imposing conditions
on suppliers and customers ``is a form of predatory pricing''
because if the company didn't impose these conditions it presumably
could charge more. And he even repeats the single argument that he
is best known for demolishing: that a rich company can sustain
losses longer than a poor company, drive it under, and then raise
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Antitrust Paradox'' called predatory pricing ``a
phenomenon that probably does not exist.'' An aspiring predator,
Bork pointed out, would have to be willing to lose more money than
its victim for as long as the game went on. (Reason: It would be
selling more units, and losing money on each sale. And if it wasn't
losing money on each sale, the pricing would be efficient, not
predatory.) The predator could not count on the advantage of a
larger war chest, Bork argued, because if the victim were a going
concern apart from the predator's misbehavior, the capital markets
should be willing to bankroll its side of the battle. And predation
would only pay off if the survivor could and did raise prices
enough afterward to make up the enormous losses of the fight.
Between one thing and another, Bork concluded back then, alleged
victims of predatory pricing were almost surely financial
hypochondriacs.
</P>
<P>
   So how come ``a phenomenon that probably does not exist'' does
exist in this case? Browser Bork's explanation is that Book Bork
didn't know from software. The marginal cost of software (cost for
one additional unit) is just about zero, therefore you can start a
price war without much expense. That is an unfortunate argument for
Browser Bork, since Book Bork makes clear that pricing must be
``below marginal cost'' to be considered predatory at all. Browser
Bork also fails to note that the victim would enjoy the same low
marginal cost as the predator. So Book Bork's argument that
predatory pricing never works and therefore never happens is just
as true as ever--or possibly just as false as ever, but at any rate
its validity is unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   The above discussion has very little to do with the Justice
Department's case against Microsoft. The DOJ never took the
position that tying arrangements, restrictive contracts, and
predatory pricing are harmless figments of the imagination, so it
is free to argue that they are dangerous monopolistic practices.
The DOJ never insisted that almost any plausible claim of economic
efficiency ought to outweigh concerns about the dangers of
monopoly, so the DOJ is free to say that in Microsoft's case they
do not.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bork is not free to say these things. Or he is not free
to say them and expect to keep his scholarly reputation. Did his
confirmation trauma turn a sprightly hard-truths ideologue into a
disingenuous cynic? If so, that's a shame. But it's no excuse.

SHOWTIME IS SHOOTING A BRICK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Showtime doesn't make any apologies for televising next
weekend's charity game between locked-out NBA players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't get into the politics of it all,'' said Showtime vice
president Jay Larkin. ``We are taking a very strong position of
having no position.''
</P>
<P>
   No position is a good position. Showtime is only televising the
event, true enough, but that action sends a signal to NBA players
and their agents that their brand of entertainment can find a home
in the 180-channel television universe.
</P>
<P>
   The product _ even if Michael Jordan plays _ will be akin to a
summer league all-star game, in which defense is absent and
teamwork is truncated to at-best a two-man game. One-on-one is the
rule; competition is between those seeking the most points or
dunks.
</P>
<P>
   Boring.
</P>
<P>
   But not according to Showtime. The cable station is using
superlatives to describe the ``ultimate,'' ``star-studded
basketball event,'' pitting the ``greatest,'' ``world's finest
basketball players'' in the ``ultimate Dream game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a no-brainer for us,'' Larkin said. ``We don't stand
to gain either way with the outcome of the NBA discusions. We view
this as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time the NBA had unresolved problems, Showtime made a
deal to have Hakeem Olajuon play Shaquille O'Neal one-on-one. The
players agreed to play, but Olajuwon injured his back and was
unable to make it.
</P>

   However, the NBA lockout comes at a different time. Public
perception of the NBA has plummeted to the point where most fans
don't care. In promoting the charity game, union spinmeisters have
tried to paint the participants _ the league's elite players _ as
looking out for the less fortunate 11th and 12th men on NBA teams.
But $1,000 per ticket?
</P>
<P>
   Why don't the highest-paid athletes just donate 1 percent of
their salaries to the fund, and allow fans to watch the event for
free?
</P>
<P>
   Even in their most charitable moments, the top dogs in the NBA
are selfish, forcing the public to pay for exorbitant greed.
</P>
<P>
   Showtime doesn't have anything to do with all of that. The cable
station paid an undisclosed amount to player agent David Falk to
televise the event.
</P>
<P>
   At the rate NBA ``discussions'' are going, the players might
have to start talking about having a league of their own _ and
having their own network televise the mess the NBA has become.

   The Sporting News has named Rupert Murdoch of Fox the most
powerful person in sports for the third time in four years. NBC
Sports chairman Dick Ebersol told the publication that ``it wasn't
even remotely a race. You could make him Nos. 1 through 5.'' Turner
Sports president Harvey Shiller also praised Murdoch. ``I think
there's a frank admission among most people at Turner that on a
worldwide basis, he's certainly the most aggressive and has
accomplished the most in terms of both ownership and regional
distribution of sports television.'' . . . HBO airs the 10-round
rematch between Ivan Robinson (26-2, 10KOs) and Arturo Gatti (29-3,
24KOs) Saturday night at 10. Gatti knocked out Robinson in the
fourth round on Aug. 22. Jim Lampley, Larry Merchant, and analyst
Roy Jones Jr. call the action from ringside. The undercard features

   CBS lead football analyst Phil Simms brings a little reason to
the raging officials debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's 8 million opinions out there about what's right and
wrong,'' Simms said. ``No matter how good the officials are, there
are going to be mistakes. The judgments the officials are asked to
make on the field are too hard sometimes. It's impossible for the
naked eye to pick these things up.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want it to be perfect, then you are going to have to
have instant replay. Even then, they can slow it down to super-slow
motion and still can't quite decipher it. No matter what solution
you come up with, it just becomes more debatable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, now every telecast will revolve around announcers
saying, `That was a bad call,' `This was a good call.' Come on, let
me watch some football. I don't want to hear all this other stuff
all the time.''

MY CONFLICT OF INTEREST 
</HEADLINE>
  By MICHAEL KINSLEY 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a Microsoft employee, I have an obvious conflict of interest
in writing this article. Being an employee also makes me a
stockholder, which is another conflict, and a friend of many
Microsoft colleagues, which is a third. And Slate is owned by
Microsoft, making four.
</P>
<P>
   But I write it anyway, simply because the subjects of Robert
Bork and antitrust law have interested me since I reviewed ``The
Antitrust Paradox'' (favorably) for the New Republic 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Also, I have waited for someone else to write this piece, and no
one has done so. Readers are free to discount or dismiss this
article because of its author. But the arguments here are all
heavily documented and can be evaluated, I think, independently of
authorship.
</P>
<P>
   Slate has established its willingness to publish articles highly
critical of Microsoft. This article, in any event, takes no
position on the merits of the Microsoft case. Bork's current
anti-Microsoft position may be correct. The challenge is to
reconcile it with anything he's said before he was hired by
Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   Like any hired expert in a legal case, Bork also has an obvious
conflict of interest. Indeed his is worse. My Microsoft paycheck
does not depend on agreeing with my paymasters. Bork's Netscape
paycheck does.

AGE OF THE MUTANT MORALISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  By WILLIAM SALETAN 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many years ago, the editor of this magazine, who was then the
editor of the New Republic, coined an aphorism for political
influence peddlers who defended their shady methods on the grounds
that they didn't violate the law. The scandal, he observed, isn't
what's illegal, but what's legal.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, politics has stagnated, science has exploded, and
the art of moral rationalization has mutated to suit the new
environment. In this world, the game is redesigning human beings,
the stakes are ownership of the fountain of youth, and the scandal
is what passes as ``ethical.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and Sen. Tom Harkin,
D-Iowa, convened a hearing to examine the moral implications of two
recent experiments. Researchers funded by one company, Geron,
testified that they had taken ``stem cells'' from human embryos and
fetuses and had grown them into neurons, muscle cells, and other
tissues. Meanwhile, the CEO of another company, Advanced Cell
Technology, testified that by putting the nucleus of an adult human
cell into a cow's gutted egg cell, his researchers had converted it
into an embryonic human cell, which presumably could be manipulated
in the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we learn to control the pathways that take stem cells down
the road to neurons, blood vessels, and heart cells,'' Geron's Vice
President Dr. Thomas Okarma testified, ``we can immortalize them by
telomerase gene transfer, so that sufficient quantities of these
cells can be grown for transplant applications.'' Old folks'
``degenerating organs'' would be repaired ``with young, healthy,
and fully functional cells.'' And one of the first organs to be
repaired in this way, the researchers promised, would be the brain.
</P>
<P>
   All this sounds wonderful. We can cure diseases, immortalize
cells, and theoretically live forever without the nasty old moral
problem of ``harvesting'' fetuses. But the prospect of a human
spare parts industry modeled on cooking, farming and car repair
raises a new moral problem. Human ingenuity--a grand synthesis of
agriculture, manufacturing, and information technology--is
dissolving human nature.
</P>
<P>
   The ethicists who advise politicians and biotech firms can't
comprehend the gravity of this step. Like lawyers, they dwell on
details instead of the big picture. While taking care never to
cross the line, they ignore anything short of crossing it, and they
don't notice that the line is gradually receding. They look for
moral problems in costs but never in benefits. And they quarrel
over yesterday's issues while being overrun by tomorrow's.
</P>
<P>
   For years, biotechnology ethics has been mired in the politics
of abortion. Since federal law restricts research on fetal tissue
and human embryos, the debate over stem cells has focused on
whether they are embryos and, if not, whether scientists are
killing embryos to get them. The token biotech critic at last
week's hearing, Richard Doerflinger of the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops, ignored the novel implications of the latest
experiments, complaining instead that the researchers had destroyed
embryos in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, pro-biotech witnesses argued that the stem cells in
the experiments were only ``pluripotent'' (capable of forming many
tissues), not ``totipotent'' (capable of forming an entire body),
and therefore weren't organisms or embryos. ``The issue that we're
dealing with,'' said Harold Varmus, the director of the National
Institutes of Health, ``is complying with the law, knowing the
legal definition of an organism.''
</P>
<P>
   But this lawyerly parsing misses the larger moral challenge: The
distinction between organisms and non-organisms is collapsing. In
embryonic development, totipotent cells (ostensibly organisms)
divide into pluripotent cells (ostensibly non-organisms), which in
turn divide into cells that are ``committed'' to become specific
tissues. The differences in time and in degree of versatility can
be subtle. Moreover, the cow-egg experiment, like the previous
cloning of a sheep, proved that the cycle is reversible:
``Committed'' adult cells can be restored to embryonic totipotency.
</P>
<P>
   The ethicists who testified at the hearing were obtuse to this
conundrum. The executive director of the National Bioethics
Advisory Committee confessed that in the course of discussing the
stem cell experiments, NBAC hadn't got around to the question of
defining an organism. Doerflinger, the Catholic spokesman, was so
intent on asserting the unique personhood of totipotent cells that
he dismissed pluripotent cells, by contrast, as non-organisms.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than confront the new moral questions raised by stem cell
technologies, the witnesses praised them for abolishing the old
moral questions. Banks of stem cells, Varmus observed, would reduce
the need for ``fetal donors.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel's discussion of the cow-egg experiment was equally
shallow. Harkin quoted from a letter in which President Clinton had
said he was ``deeply troubled by this news of experiments involving
the mingling of human and nonhuman species.'' The senators joined
Michael West, the CEO who had supervised the experiment, in
debunking this ``misinformation'' (the cow's genomic DNA was never
mixed with the human DNA) and deriding the half-bovine, half-human
monsters drawn by editorial cartoonists as ``science fiction.''
West explained that he had used the cow egg only to ``reprogram''
the human cell, making it ``young again'' and restoring its ability
to ``become any cell type.'' The fake issue of mixing species thus
obscured the genuine issue of ``reprogramming.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MUTANT-SLATE-1000&AMP;ADD-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: of ``reprogramming.'') &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The other overhyped controversy that distracts ethicists from
the real action is cloning. The notion of replicating whole human
beings transfixes biotech alarmists. This concern, like species
mixing, is easily dispelled. ``We are not cloning human beings,''
West testified at the hearing. Indeed, why manufacture whole people
when there's more money in the parts business? The horror movie
scenario--cloning your whole body, freezing the clone, and
``harvesting'' its liver and kidneys when you need them--diverts
scrutiny from the real scenario: ``banking'' your stem cells and
growing them into new organs, including brain tissue, a la carte.
</P>
<P>
   This erosion of the distinction between whole humans and their
parts--technicians will be able to tweak your cells either
way--brings into question the moral privileges we attribute to
whole humans, such as personhood and bodily integrity. But no one
broached these questions at the hearing. Instead, as with abortion,
the panelists praised the new techniques for solving the old
questions. Doerflinger happily argued that by demonstrating other
ways of deriving stem cells, the new experiments had proved that
the cloning of whole embryos could be banned, as Catholic scholars
have proposed, without disrupting biotech research.
</P>
<P>
   Ethicists also have trouble recognizing the new issues because
they're trained to look for moral problems in technology's costs,
not in its benefits. Dr. Arthur Caplan, the only ethicist at the
hearing who betrayed any awareness of the new issues, focused
instead on the morality of ``trade-offs.'' ``We should seek to
achieve the most good or benefit, with the least harm and
destruction of things that we value,'' he argued.
</P>
<P>
   But the benefits of the new technologies--ultimately,
immortality and the rewriting of the recipe for human beings--are
precisely what philosophers ought to ponder. Where are we going?
What are we becoming?
</P>
<P>
   The immediate threat posed by the unraveling of the old physical
and moral distinctions--between human beings and human parts,
organisms and nonorganisms, subjects and objects--is that private
interests will come to own the stuff of which we're made.
</P>
<P>
   As the hearing ended, Harkin expressed alarm that biotech
companies were claiming licenses and patents to human stem cells.
He said this concern had to do with the law, ``not with ethical and
moral implications.'' But if ethics is relegated to peripheral and
obsolete questions while industry deconstructs, redesigns and
manufactures human components just like any other commodity, laws
that exempt these components from patenting, licensing and other
property rights will lose their moral basis. And critics who object
that human life is sacred won't have a leg to stand on.

MONEYBOX: THE URGE TO MERGE 
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES SUROWIECKI 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the wake of the Exxon/Mobil merger, we've seen a small flurry
of articles arguing that acquisitions generally don't make sense,
except for the shareholders of the company that's being acquired.
</P>
<P>
   And in the wake of the New England Patriots' move to Hartford,
where Connecticut plans to build them a lovely $350-million
stadium, we've seen a wave of articles arguing that sports teams
are not sources of economic development and that deals of the sort
Connecticut has offered the Pats are corporate welfare of the worst
sort.
</P>
<P>
   Both sets of stories are, of course, unquestionably accurate.
What's curious is that repeating these truths is still somehow
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to keep writing articles that say ``supply rises
to meet demand,'' after all. Yet when it comes to mergers and
acquisitions and to stadium-building, the economically rational
position has to be continually restated, because economic
rationality is persistently trumped by corporate ambition, simple
greed and political posturing. And what's especially appalling
about the whole state of affairs is that in both cases wealth keeps
getting redistributed upward for no apparent reason other than that
it can be.
</P>
<P>
   Some mergers, of course, do make sense. They remove excess
capacity, improve productivity, or allow companies to benefit from
economies of scale. But in evaluating any merger the basic
presumption has to be that it's a bad idea. This is not a subject
for argument any more. It's a fact. The empirical research is too
strong to be disputed.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, we don't need any more pieces about why mergers in
general don't work (and I've written more than a few of those
pieces). We need deal-specific analyses of what real business
purposes a given merger will accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, what we'll find, more often than not, is that the
merger is the product of delusions of grandeur, imaginary
predictions of synergy, or, as Warren Buffett once put it, the
irresistible desire to buy a company because everyone else is doing
it. In the very worst cases, we'll find that managers are
orchestrating deals to line their own pockets, either in the form
of lucrative golden parachutes or the piles of stock options
they're sitting on.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of stadiums, we don't even need deal-specific
analyses, because no deal in which a state or city puts up hundreds
of millions of dollars to build a stadium from which a sports team
will derive all the profit is a good deal. When Pats owner Henry
Kraft announced he was moving the team to Hartford, he wept, in as
moving a display of crocodile tears as I've ever seen. The state of
Connecticut itself, in its own study, says that it'll take at least
14 years for the Patriots to generate enough revenue for the state
to cover the cost of building the stadium. And that's if everything
goes perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that the best way for an already debt-ridden state to
spend public funds is to give the money to a multimillionaire would
be staggering if it weren't happening all across America. A sports
team isn't an auto factory, after all. Most of the revenue goes to
pay the salaries, not of 10,000 blue-collar workers, but of 50
millionaire athletes, who deserve everything they can get, but
don't deserve to have their workplace subsidized by taxpayer money.
</P>
<P>
   So why do these economically irrational things keep happening?
For the most obvious reason: because the people for whom the
decisions are economically irrational (shareholders in the case of
mergers and taxpayers in the case of stadiums) are not making those
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, they could. And in theory, they should. But so much
smoke is blown in these cases that people still have a hard time
seeing through it. And the costs are removed enough--we'll have the
stadium a year from now, but we won't see the schools that haven't
been built as a result--that you need a longer-term perspective to
see them. Of course, that's no reason not to adopt that
perspective. The Connecticut legislature and Exxon shareholders
still have a chance to say no. Let's hope they do.

HOLLYWOOD'S $17 MILLION WOMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  World rights except Great Britain and Australia 
 Color slides and black and white photos of Julia Roberts, Susan
Sarandon, Liam Aiken and Jena Malone in ``Stepmom.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    ``I don't want to be known as Hollywood's $17 million woman,''
says Julia Roberts, ``although I've been known as worse things.
 &HT;    ``I'd prefer to be known as the 'great friend woman,' 'the great
actress woman' _ or the 'nice legs woman.' Now that would be OK.''
 &HT;    Nevertheless, the 31-year-old Roberts is picking up that fat
paycheck for the film she's currently shooting _ reuniting with her
``Pretty Woman'' co-star Richard Gere and director Garry Marshall
in ``Runaway Bride.''
 &HT;    She's earning considerably less for playing the title role
opposite Susan Sarandon and Ed Harris in ``Stepmom'' (opening Dec.
25), although she and Sarandon could clean up nicely if the film
turns out to be a box office smash because they were producers on
the film.
 &HT;    In ``Stepmom,'' Sarandon plays Jackie, whose ex-husband (Harris)
has married Isabel, a vain, ambitious fashion photographer played
by Roberts. Not surprisingly neither Sarandon nor her two young
children are wild about their father's new spouse.
 &HT;    Things change, however, when Jackie learns she is dying. At
first Isabel is less than thrilled when she realizes she's
inheriting a family. She has to learn to change her priorities and
win the love and trust of the ailing Sarandon and her young
children if she is to grow into the stepmom role.
 &HT;    Roberts, looking relaxed with her hair down to her shoulders and
dressed in sweater and slacks, was in obvious good humor she showed
up at New York's Waldorf-Astoria to talk her role, which she calls
the most mature of her career.
 &HT;    Roberts, without children of her own, still found herself in
sympathy with Isabel since the character's life was much like that
of a career-driven actress.
 &HT;    ``Isabel says she never wanted to be a mom and yet finds herself
struggling to cope with being a surrogate parent--an unwanted
stepparent,'' says Roberts. ``Given her age she's more interested
in her career than stuck with a family. I can relate to that. And
it's a no-win situation because Jackie is the perfect mother and
Isabel can only come off a poor second when she tries to become a
parent.''
 &HT;    Should Roberts herself decide to become a parent, she says she
is certainly not about to become a stay-at-home.
 &HT;    ``I don't understand this one-versus-the-other business,
especially in this generation. Would any of us be here as capable
human beings if our parents didn't work? My mother always worked. I
know people talk as if this work I do would make it more difficult.
I have no children so maybe I'm talking out of the side of my head,
but it seems to me that you work for four months and then you don't
work for like nine months. That's a lot of kid time.''
 &HT;    And she's the first to admit that the kind of money her
star-wattage commands would pay for a lot of mother's helpers. Now
that she's become Hollywood's highest paid female star, however,
the actress insists getting paid big bucks is the last thing she
thinks about.
 &HT;    ``I love what I do and I'd do it for free,'' she says. ``I'm not
going to perform better if I get paid more or less. It's not pound
for pound--where you only pay for the legs or the smile or the big
hair. That's not how it works. When you're up at 4 a.m. and out in
a bikini and it's 30 degrees outside--it doesn't matter how much
they're paying you. At that moment you still think it's not
enough.''
 &HT;    Roberts says she's no longer the callow, vulnerable 20-something
star whose personal life has been chronicled to the point of
exhaustion since she first burst on the scene in ``Mystic Pizza''
(1988), ``Steel Magnolias'' (1989) and then as a star in ``Pretty
Woman'' (1990).
 &HT;    ```Stepmom' is first real-life grown-up part that deals with
real complex issues and problems I've ever done. It's about kids,
husband, job, not about makeup and wardrobe. I couldn't have done
it five years ago--it wouldn't have had the same value to me.''
 &HT;    Besides teaming up with Gere again she has just finished
``Notting Hill,'' shot in London, in which she gets to romance Hugh
Grant for writer Richard Curtis who wrote ``Four Weddings and a
Funeral.''
 &HT;    And her career is riding high again after a series of flop
movies like Woody Allen's ``Everyone Says I Love You'' (1996),
Robert Altman's ``Ready to Wear'' (1994), the horror film ``Mary
Reilly'' (1996) and ``The Conspiracy Theory'' (1997) opposite Mel
Gibson.
 &HT;    Her private life reads like a five-reeler: In l991 she broke off
her engagement with Kiefer Sutherland three days before the
wedding. In l993 she married singer Lyle Lovett but they divorced
21 months later. In between were relationships with Dylan McDermot,
Liam Neeson, Jason Patric and New York gym-owner Pat Manocchia.
 &HT;    She insists her relationship with TV actor Benjamin Bratt (``Law
and Order'') is still on despite published reports to the contrary.
But she says, ``I'm not getting married any time soon.''
 &HT;    Bratt has lasted more than a year on her arm but she still lives
alone in a New York apartment not far from her sister Lisa who is
two years older. (Roberts also has an older brother, actor Eric
Roberts.)
 &HT;    In the long-awaited reunion with Gere she plays a woman who goes
from man to man. Is the role based on her own penchant for skipping
from boyfriend to boyfriend?
 &HT;    She good naturedly handles the question: ``Of course not, '' she
says. ``The movie is fiction.''
 &HT;    But there's no doubt she's delighted to be back with her
``Pretty Woman'' star, and she adores the film's director,
Marshall.
 &HT;    ``The whole film has been a gas,'' she says. ``Garry is
fantastic and gets me to go out on a limb and do things I wouldn't
do for other directors. I know I can trust him. On `Pretty Woman'
he had me do something I was scared about. I thought I'd humiliate
myself forever but when I saw the scene in the finished movie with
an audience, people were peeing laughing.''
 &HT;    Since shooting ``Stepmom'' she has become bosom buddies with
co-star Sarandon, who has a family with actor-director Tim Robbins:
``Susan and Tim are my absolute idols,'' says Roberts. ``Some day I
would like to have the kind of career that Susan has and the kind
of relationship with a man that she has with Tim.''

   From a 1000-word feature by Hollywood Stars columnist Ivor
Davis:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be known as Hollywood's $17 million woman,''
says Julia Roberts, ``although I've been known as worse things.
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old Roberts is picking up that fat paycheck for the
film she's currently shooting _ reuniting with her ``Pretty Woman''
co-star Richard Gere and director Garry Marshall in ``Runaway
Bride.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts was in obvious good humor she showed up at New York's

CONFESSIONS OF A RETIRED AUDIOLOGIST
</HEADLINE>
  By PHILIP A. BELLEFLEUR 
 c.1998 Philip A. Bellefleur 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After 30 years as an audiologist for the deaf and
hard-of-hearing, I have aged into one of the very patients whom I
counseled for so long.
</P>
<P>
   I am reminded of this irony daily as I refuse to address my own
diminishing sense of hearing. Each morning, I look in my mirror and
I confront the image of a man, who in my professional judgment
should be wear a hearing aid, but does not.
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey taken in 1994 by the National Center for
Health Statistics, I am part of that 44.5 percent of the population
of the United States over the age of 55 having a significant
hearing loss. In most cases, age-related hearing loss is actually a
genetic condition. It's as though we were born with a little clock
inside that switches itself on between 40 and 50 years of age.
</P>
<P>
   It may go unnoticed for several years and be so subtle others
are aware of it long before we are. It may start with annoying
ringing or buzzing in the ear, after which it begins to affect our
ability to hear soft consonant sounds _ ``sh,'' ``th,'' ``ch''_
especially in the presence of environmental noise or when the
speaker's face is no longer visible.
</P>
<P>
   It is often mistaken as a problem of the talker rather than the
listener. I've heard women describe this type of deafness as
``married-man's ear.'' At age 30 for example, I could wander around
the house and with no effort at all hear and understand a story my
wife was relating. At 65, I must see her directly or her speech
sounds garbled.
</P>
<P>
   As the condition worsens more consonants are involved ( ``d,''
``b,'' ``v''), until we feel as though we hear well, but just don't
understand what is being said. This is the essence of the condition
I call ``senior deafness.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, you feel your condition is unique. You feel alone
with your frustration of being able to hear but not understand. You
begin to avoid group events where you must take part in
conversation and your participation in meetings drops to near zero.
Face-to-face conversation in your living room is much the same as
always, but marble halls, tiled floors and city streets become
nearly impossible places to understand conversation. At home, your
grandchildren mumble and your wife constantly complains you play
the television too loud.
</P>
<P>
   After waiting much too long, you may decide to talk to your
physician. Perhaps you visit an ear specialist called an otologist,
or a licensed audiologist, the kind with a Ph.D. Any of these
professionals will conduct diagnostic tests; the suggestion that
you need a hearing aid will figure prominently in most diagnoses.
</P>
<P>
   Other patients will end up in the office of a hearing-aid
``fitter'' with only minimal knowledge of the hearing mechanism and
no training in diagnosing hearing disorders. Still, if your only
problem is age-related deafness, a fitter may be the most
economical solution. Be advised if you avail yourself of any
hearing test advertised as ``free,'' you will certainly be told you
need a hearing aid.
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, the smaller the hearing aid the less sound
it will amplify, but the better it will look. But whether you opt
for the $2,500 model which is so small you may have difficulty
handling it, or the larger economy model for around $350-$900,
chances are you will end up dissatisfied. Why? Two simple reasons:
</P>
<P>
   First, most of us simply don't wish to be seen wearing another
prosthetic device on our head. By 65, more than a few of us already
have trifocals, a hair piece and false teeth. Add a hearing aid or
two and we begin seeing ourselves as Robocop with wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   If you have trouble visualizing yourself wearing a hearing aid,
don't buy one no matter who tries to influence you. Half of the
hearing aids purchased in the United States today are in medicine
cabinets or bureau drawers.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the technology allowing audiologists and physicians to
tell you precisely why you cannot hear or understand speech far
exceeds the technology needed to rehabilitate your hearing. It's
hard to believe a country capable of landing a man on the moon
can't make an electronic hearing aid enabling us to hear the sounds
of speech clearly again, but we can't, or at least we can't do it
very well.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to purchase an aid is not like the decision to
purchase eye glasses. With glasses you put them on and see 99
percent of the things you've been missing. You see them clearly and
with a minimum of discomfort. Wearing a hearing aid is more like
the purchase of dentures. They don't look or feel like the
original, and certainly don't work as well, but if you put up with
all the discomfort and disadvantages, and practice using them they
can be very helpful.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 50 years the advances in hearing aid design have
been dramatic, but for the consumer change has been mostly
cosmetic. Hearing aids have indeed become smaller and hence more
appealing, but in terms of being able to clarify speech and improve
speech discrimination damaged in senior deafness the key to success
is still the willingness of the wearer to adapt to the limitations
of the current technology.

ARE TODAY'S KIDS HARDER TO HANDLE?
</HEADLINE>
  By KYLE D. PRUETT 
 c.1998 Child magazine 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Emily's long day was finally ending.
</P>
<P>
   The 4-year-old had needed to stay late at school because her
father's train was delayed and he couldn't get to her preschool
until an hour and a half after the usual pickup time.
</P>
<P>
   She wanted to wait for her father in the parking lot so she
could catch the first glimpse of his car rounding the corner. When
told that she would have to wait inside where it was safer, Emily
promptly sank her teeth into the teacher's forearm. Fortunately, no
permanent damage was done, but neither the child nor her teacher
could have been more surprised. Emily had always been a cooperative
and well-behaved kid from a ``nice home.''
</P>
<P>
   Such acts of aggression are occurring more frequently in
childcare settings. As a consultant to private and public daycare
and family-care providers for several decades, I have seen an
increase in this behavior in even the most advantaged and
competently run childcare facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Lola Nash, lecturer in education at Yale University's Child
Study Center, who has established and directed early-childhood
programs in and around Yale for 30 years, observes: ``There's been
a dramatic increase in this kind of aggressive upset in childcare
over the past decade. All the programs I work with are struggling
to develop policies to handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   A teacher in a private kindergarten in a Boston suburb says,
``Often, my classroom feels out of control. The speech is 'in your
face' and 'street talk,' even from kids who were raised in suburban
areas. Verbal aggression, teasing, and sarcasm are common, and most
of us can name children from good families who've decked or bitten
someone in the past year.''
</P>
<P>
   Expressing and mastering aggression is a normal and healthy part
of child development. Aggression is the drive to use our bodies, to
move about in space, to reach out and grab what we want. Aggression
gets us up on our feet and helps us learn to walk.
</P>
<P>
   Violence, on the other hand, is the intended use of physical
force to injure or abuse, and it is certainly not a normal, healthy
part of a child's development.
</P>
<P>
   We say no to babies, toddlers and preschoolers mostly to keep
them safe from the stairs, the street, the poisons under the
kitchen sink, the stranger and the unknown dog. But why should your
child listen to you? ``Because I'm the Dad (or Mom)'' carries
weight occasionally, but the real reason that no works is the child
believes this: Daddy and Mommy say no because they know what's best
for me; they love me and want to keep me safe.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Too many caregivers? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Herein lies a dilemma for many young families who need to divide
the care of their children between people who love them deeply _
parents and other relatives _ and people who may like their
children well enough _ daycare staff and educators _ but are not
invested in them unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
   The more caregivers a child has when he is learning how to
master his aggressive impulses and the greater the variability of
his experience with limit-setting adults, the harder he will find
it to develop the trust that prompts him to behave well for someone
whom he loves.
</P>
<P>
   Young children who are exposed to too much variety in caregiving
situations or to too many caregiver changes may begin to wonder,
``Why should I struggle to master my favorite aggressive impulses
for you? You may like me and know how to bathe and feed me, but you
don't really know me or love me, and I don't know or love you. So
is it really worth it for me to restrict my 'me first' impulses for
you?''
</P>
<P>
   From there, a preschooler can easily conclude: ``Well, then, I
guess it's every kid for himself around here.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Media influence &LR;
</P>
<P>
   We know that young children are susceptible to visual images of
aggression, repeating and mirroring the violence they encounter in
movies, electronic games or cartoons for hours _ or days _
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   As a clinician, I know there's a limit to the number of violent
images that children can absorb before feeling overwhelmed. Their
ability to neutralize the visual toxins emotionally is vastly more
limited than ours; can we be surprised when violence spills over in
their play for days afterward?
</P>
<P>
   Even more than movies, electronic and computer games excite our
young kids with irresistible graphics and attention-grabbing action
sequences. They keep attention levels so high that kids often have
difficulty returning to the more mundane pastels of life among
family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The voice of authority &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A small crisis in parental self-esteem may also play a part in a
young child's ability to manage everyday aggression. Erin, the
young mother of a 4-year-old daughter, works 30 hours a week
outside the home. ``I do love my work,'' she says. ``But I so want
to be with my daughter that it's hard for me not to spend the first
hour when I get home making up to her for not being there during
the day. When she challenges my authority, all I want to do is make
nice because I've missed her so much! I'm not good at setting
limits.''
</P>
<P>
   Erin's comments help explain why so many working parents place
their children in the driver's seat long before they can see over
the dashboard, then wonder why household routines last only a few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   This parental expectation that children be catered to also
influences their childcare and schooling. Karen, the suburban
Boston kindergarten teacher mentioned earlier, struggles with the
growing number of well-intentioned parents who urge teachers not to
quash their children's ``spirit.'' While a rigid classroom can
certainly stifle expressiveness, the educator's concern centers on
the difficulty some of these ``overappreciated'' children have in
sharing classroom supplies and equipment
</P>
<P>
   Are there any solutions? Yes. Here are several strategies to
consider:
</P>
<P>
   _ Limit the number of caregivers your young child must deal
with. A few family members and a couple of daycare or school
professionals handling physical and emotional needs is about it for
kids under age 5.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stay in close touch with your childcare providers about how
your child is doing, emotionally as well as physically. If you
don't get clear descriptions or stories that match your own
experience, the staff may be too busy with other kids. Ask the
director to keep an eye on things and to get back to you. When you
collaborate closely with the important people in your child's life,
both you and he are reassured.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep tabs on what your child is watching and playing. Then
observe her moods. It will be clear to you if your child is
suffering from a toxic accumulation of internal aggression. Don't
worry about being the only parent on earth who won't allow his or
her child to watch the newest multimedia dismemberment spectacle.
Check out the thoughtful, age-appropriate movie and television
guides for kids available at local public libraries.
</P>
<P>
   _ Review the routines that your family follows. What you haven't
any? That might explain why you feel so exhausted. The chaos that
tends to take over when you don't have at least some routines in
place keeps the stimulation and tension levels in you and your kids
fairly high because you can never leave the negotiating table and
get on with life. Kids often embrace routines with enthusiasm; they
offer a sense of order and control, which raises children's
aggression threshold.
</P>
<P>
   _ When you say no to a child, let him know you understand how
much he wants what you've ruled out. Accepting the emotional part
of your child's aggressive drives (``I don't want to go to bed
yet!'') lets him know that he doesn't always have to act out
physically to get his point across. Furthermore, it sets up a way
for you and your child to commiserate about the daily
disappointments of life within the context of the loving
relationship between the two of you.
</P>
<P>
   Because understanding intervenes, your child feels comforted and
the pressure to be aggressive eases.

POETRY IN MOTION
</HEADLINE>
  Includes color photo, available by e-mail, of Andrew Carroll
handing out free poetry books at the St. Louis Zoo. 
 By TOM DUNKEL 
 c.1998 Tom Dunkel 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shirley Armstrong is minding her own shopping business at a
Washington, D.C., supermarket when a friendly fellow walks up and
hands her a paperback booklet.
</P>
<P>
   She figures it for a high-class coupon promotion, her chance to
save big on solid white tuna or barbecue-flavored potato chips.
``The first thing I did (was ask), What kind of food items are on
sale in here?'' says Armstrong, thumbing the pages. ``Then I said,
My God, it's, poetry!''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't 20-percent-off-manufacturer's-suggested-retail-price
poetry, either. This is absolutely free poetry. And grade A
quality: tasty morsels of Robert Frost, Carl Sandburg, Langston
Hughes and other big name bards. ``Now I've got something to do
tonight,'' Armstrong chirps, ``and it' not Blockbuster Video.''
</P>
<P>
   That friendly fellow giving dozens of startled shoppers copies
of ``101 Great American Poems'' is Andy Carroll, the 29-year-old
unpaid executive director of the American Poetry and Literacy
Project, a shoestring nonprofit organization based in Washington,
D.C., with the lofty goal of (pardon the rhyme) awakening America's
poetic soul.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll _ a native Washingtonian who earns his living as a
freelance writer and editor _ encounters Shirley Armstrong on the
second day of a 6,529-mile, New York-to-San Francisco odyssey
dubbed The Great Appleseed Giveaway. The concept couldn't be
simpler: Andy Carroll hops into a rental truck loaded with 100,000
poetry books and heads west, showering literally free verse upon
whomever he meets.
</P>
<P>
   His target destinations aren't made-to-order venues such as
coffeehouses and high-school English classes. He plans to hit jury
rooms, turnpike rest areas, even Elvis Presley's Memphis mansion;
everywhere that everyday folks with time on their hands can be
found.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his supermarket stop, Carroll swings by the
Pentagon (where scores of rigid-posture passersby quickly gobble up
more than a thousand books) and the tourists' entrance to the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poetry, it's the vegetable of the literary world,'' he
declares while driving across town on his poetry-promotion rounds.
More and more people have begun eating their literary
``vegetables.'' Sales of poetry books are up nationwide, as is the
number of public poetry readings.
</P>
<P>
   Hip-hop music has helped spawn a ``spoken word'' movement. ``It
really does feel like poetry's finest hour,'' says Toni Bevan,
director of marketing and promotion at The Academy of American
Poets. ``There are a lot of things contributing to that. You could
certainly say Andy is one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll wouldn't say that, though. He gives the lion's share of
the credit to the late Joseph Brodsky, the Nobel Prize-winning
Russian-emigre poet. In 1991, in a speech that was printed later in
New Republic, Brodsky lamented the fact that print-based literacy
was gradually giving way to a dumbed-down, visually-oriented
``videocy.''
</P>
<P>
   As an antidote, he proposed making poetry ``as ubiquitous as the
nature that surrounds us ... as ubiquitous as gas stations, if not
as cars themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Brodsky's name didn't really ring a bell with Andy Carroll, who
had taken just one poetry course as a Columbia University
undergrad. Well, actually, it rang the wrong bell: Carroll thought
he was a retired Russian cosmonaut.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Brodsky's call to arms struck a responsive chord.
Carroll immediately wrote him a letter offering to help
saturation-bomb the United States with great poetry. Turns out it
was the only offer Brodsky received, and in 1993, Brodsky and
Carroll launched the American Poetry and Literacy Project.
</P>
<P>
   It has no employees. It sponsors no conferences, publishes no
newsletter. It just raises money from corporations, foundations and
private citizens, uses the cash to buy poetry books, and then gives
them all away in person or through the mail _ more than 200,000
books and counting.
</P>
<P>
   Brodsky died of a heart attack in 1996, and ex-poets laureate
Rita Dove and Robert Hass have since lent their names to the APLP
cause. However, as Carroll notes, ``Joseph was it. In some ways,
he's irreplaceable.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll personally takes care of business in the Washington
area, dropping off books at hospitals, nursing homes and other
sites. But he has also developed a nationwide network of poetry
compadres. Amtrak executives once stocked the cafe car on the
Washington-to-Boston run with 1,500 copies of ``100 Best Loved
Poems.'' One Halloween in Austin, Texas, the county tax assessor
and the local coroner held a ``Death and Taxes'' reading at a
library, dipping into spooky selections from Edgar Allan Poe's
``The Raven and Other Poems.''
</P>
<P>
   After Brodsky's death, Carroll was determined to take to the
road in his memory. In some respects, Carroll was the worst man for
the job. He flunked his driver's test three times before passing
and had never driven more than 400 miles from home.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he possesses the requisite freewheeling spirit for such an
undertaking. He got Ryder to donate a truck. Doubletree hotels
provided rooms on the road. Washington State Apple Growers _
intrigued by the Johnny Appleseed-like notion of reaping and sowing
literacy through poetry plantings _ picked up the tab for the
books.
</P>
<P>
   Today there are plans to compile a book of travel-related
poetry, perfect for slipping into seat pockets on trains and
planes. He's also looking for a corporate sponsor to underwrite the
cost of giving away 1 million books. Sound quixotic? Or crazy?
</P>
<P>
   Either way, don't expect Andy Carroll to sit on the sidelines
watching the demise of Western civilization and the rise of Fox
Network. After all, this is a guy who walked into a swank Las Vegas
casino and was blown away by an innocuous sign in the gambling pit.
``It read: 'You must be present to win,''' says Carroll. ``That's
one of the most poetic things I've ever seen in my life.''

   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ His lifestyle may be another matter, but in
the locker room and on the field, Ben Coates is considered a loyal
teammate and a Hall of Fame player, as indispensable to the
Patriots as are Drew Bledsoe and Terry Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   They may not have him Sunday in St. Louis for a game that
potentially could clinch a playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   Coates was scheduled to fly Thursday night to Greenwood, S.C.,
to attend services for his mother, Mozzella, 56, who died Wednesday
from a brain tumor.
</P>
<P>
   While one of his attorneys initially said Coates would miss the
game, that decision will be made by the tight end Saturday after he
assesses the situation with his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Ben will have to see how his family is handling things
in South Carolina,'' said his agent, Michael George. ``When I spoke
to him, he sounded devastated. It was expected his mother would
live longer than she did. He's been through a lot this year.''
</P>
<P>
   His aunt and sister both died over the summer. Then Coates was
charged with domestic assault. He was found innocent in Wrentham
District Court Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a strong person like Ben is, mentally and
physically, you learn to handle things like that,'' said Patriots
wide receiver Shawn Jefferson. ``You know that life is going to
present you different challenges and stuff like that, and when it
does, you have to be ready for those things.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a weak person, stuff like that can really get to
you. But he's a strong guy mentally and physically. Now, maybe some
other guy wouldn't be able to handle all the stuff he's going
through this year. But he's handled it great. His performance
hasn't dropped off any. He's leading the team in receptions and
stuff. And he's a big part of our offense. And I'll tell you right
now, we're behind Ben 100 percent of the way. And our hearts go out
to Ben.''
</P>
<P>
   This would be the second game Coates has missed this season. In
the second game of the season against the Indianapolis Colts, he
was sidelined by two ankle sprains he'd suffered in the first half
of the opener at Denver. It ended a streak of 113 consecutive games
played. Without him, the Patriots beat the Colts, 29-6.
</P>
<P>
   Lovett Purnell, a 6-foot-3-inch, 245-pounder, started in
Coates's spot in Indianapolis and made one catch for 22 yards. Now
he's awaiting word on Coates's status for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been playing three years now, so it's really no big
deal,'' said Purnell, who has six catches for 47 yards and a
touchdown. ``I just got to go out there and step up and do my job.
I'll probably get a chance to do some things. I don't know if Ben
is going to come back or what. The situation may be up in the air,
but whatever it may be, I'm just gonna go out and help my team
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Because he's been in this situation before, Purnell said, ``I'm
very comfortable with it. I already had to do it earlier in the
year against the Colts. I think the team is very comfortable. Drew
(Bledsoe) is comfortable with me being in there. And that's very
important. As long as everybody is comfortable with me . . . as
I've said, it's my third year. If it was my first year, maybe I'd
be a little nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Purnell has often been in the game at the same time as Coates.
The coaching staff considers him an excellent pure receiver who is
still lacking in other areas, mainly blocking. Purnell has also had
to learn to play H-back, which essentially is a second fullback.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really nothing I can do better than Ben,'' said
Purnell. ``I can't take his spot because he's an All-Pro player.
He's proved himself. What I got to do is go out there and do some
of the things that I do well _ catching the ball, running long
routes, stuff like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson says the team has faith in Purnell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben is a great player,'' he said. ``You're gonna have
situations arise throughout the season and stuff where guys are
going to have to step in. And when Lovett steps in, we don't expect
any drop-off. Lovett is a good tight end, and Ben has some things
he has to straighten out right now. And our hearts go out to him.
But you don't have to tell a guy like Lovett nothing because he's a
professional and he knows what's at stake. And he knows he has a
job to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Purnell has been around Coates for three years. He was drafted
in the seventh round out of West Virginia and anointed Coates's
heir apparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got to go out there every day and work hard, and
hopefully on Sunday, I get a chance to play,'' said Purnell. ``But
yes, it's very difficult sometimes. Especially when you have an
All-Pro player on your team. Like I said, some games I'll play, and
hopefully this will be one of those games that I step up and play
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Purnell said his first Patriots camp was tough because ``I was
coming from a school where I was the man. I came here and he was
the man. So it was definitely a challenge to get a friendship with
Ben, and I think now that we have that, hopefully, he can get back
so we can both be in the game together.''
</P>
<P>
   Purnell said he's learned from Coates about ``just being
consistent. If I make one great play, I have to come back the next
time and make another one. Just be ready at any time to make a big
play. I'm not gonna try to be Ben Coates, I'm gonna try to be
Lovett Purnell and play the best way I can.''

IT'S TOO EARLY TO FOLLOW THE BOUNCING BALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember when college basketball was primarily a winter game
and, for a few glorious days each March, a spring game?
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore. Oh, we still have the glory and excitement of the
NCAA tournament in March. And we can come up with some conference
gems in midwinter.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to a plethora of so-called ``exempt'' games, which
has pushed the start of the regular season to the point where we'll
have games that count before Halloweeners trick-or-treat, college
basketball has become a sport for all seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Let us be either the first or the latest to offer an opinion.
November basketball stinks. Too much too soon.
</P>
<P>
   Rhode Island played its first game Nov. 9. Tournaments in
Alaska, Hawaii, and New York are all part of the pre-Thanksgiving
menu. Teams pile up more frequent flier miles than travel agents on
junkets.
</P>
<P>
   Take Kansas. The Jayhawks spent Thanskgiving in Springfield for
the Tip-Off Classic (a total misnomer) against Nevada-Las Vegas the
next night. They then went home to Lawrence, Kan., for a few days,
got on a plane, and headed to Chicago for a Great Eight Classic
game against Kentucky. From there, they got on a plane and flew to
Anaheim for a Wooden Classic appearance against Pepperdine.
</P>
<P>
   What we have not had in almost every case is classic basketball.
Yet few teams can resist the enticement of guaranteed money and
television exposure from Maui or Fairbanks or San Juan.
</P>
<P>
   Classroom time _ or missed classroom time _ is a joke. Let's not
hear any nonsense from school presidents about opposing a football
playoff because it would mean too many missed classes.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball teams abuse that concept regularly, especially in
March, and now they are traipsing all over the country in late
November and early December, when most schools schedule
first-semester final exams.
</P>
<P>
   One of the holdouts is St. Joseph's under coach Phil Martelli.
The Hawks opened their season two days after Thanksgiving against
Tulsa, which was later than anybody else.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fitting games in and I don't know why,'' said Martelli.
``We don't know what we're doing. In a couple of years, we're going
to be standing around wondering what went wrong and why the
interest level is down. The quality of play (in November) is not
good. The lack of interest is amazing. The season is too long.''
</P>
<P>
   Martelli wonders where this push for early games developed. And
why.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the rush is or where it came from,'' he
said. ``I honestly believe in a couple of years, we're going to be
looking at each other and say, `What happened to the interest?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Martelli blames some of it on a pack mentality. One team
schedules a game early and another team's coach looks at it and
says, ``Geez, we've got to get a game under our belts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell me any game in November that has bearing with any RPI or
anything like that in March,'' said Martelli, whose team, plus
Manhattan and Ohio, were the lone holdouts against early play in
Division 1. ``The games are totally forgotten. Basketball is a
winter game.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Martelli is 100 percent right. College basketball is a
great game, but _ perhaps with the exception of selected
longstanding tournaments in Hawaii and Alaska _ not in November.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Things are looking up
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rarely does a coach whose team is 1-4 have much to smile about.
But Bruiser Flint of the University of Massachusetts may be the
exception. Sure, the Minutemen were 1-4 following their 59-54 loss
to Connecticut Wednesday night. But Flint felt his team had
bottomed out. ``I like the way we played,'' said Flint, who has
been rewarded by athltic director Bob Marcum with a two-year
contract extension. ``We showed the kind of toughness I like. I
think we'll be all right. I really do.''
</P>
<P>
   In their loss to the Huskies, the Minutemen played the tough,
in-your-face, physical basketball that has become a UMass
trademark. Center Lari Ketner, who came up with a team-high 15
points, had his best game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that UConn, which remains the No. 1 team in
the country, was better than the Minutemen. But if UMass can keep
up the intensity level, it should turn things around quickly,
probably beginning wih Saturday night's game against Boston College
at the Worcester Centrum.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Jayhawks rocked
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kansas, which is generally a nearly unbeatable team in November
and December, is having its problems. Last week the Jayhawks were
embarrassed in the Great Eight by Kentucky. This week they lost for
the first time since the 1994-95 season at Allen Field House,
falling to Iowa, 85-81, which snapped a 62-game home winning
streak. In case you were wondering, the Jayhawks weren't close to
the NCAA record of 129 straight home wins set by Kentucky from
1943-55. The loss also could put another Jayhawks streak in
jeopardy. They have been ranked in the Top 10 for 75 consecutive
Associated Press polls, dating back to 1994-95 . . . Got to love
Texas Christian coach Billy Tubbs. Seems he was not happy with the
Horned Frogs' concentration during practice, so before this week's
game against Texas Tech, he gave his players a quiz based on the
scouting report on the Red Raiders. He asked his players 110
questions. They answered 55 corrcectly. ``They got an F going into
the game, but I gave them extra credit after,'' said Tubbs
following the Frogs' 105-86 win . . . Washington is in a tailspin,
with losses to UConn, Boise State, and Gonzaga in the last week.
The Huskies' problem may be fatigue. The loss to Gonzaga this week
ended a six-game road trip that began before Thanksgiving and took
them to Hawaii, Chicago, Idaho, and Eastern Washington. Did anyone
say ``student'' athlete? . . . Here's an early candidate for
National Player of the Year: Miami of Ohio's Wally Szcerbiak. Wally
Wonder scored 31 points in Miami's 81-79 win over Marshall earlier
this week and is the prime reason the RedHawks are off to a 5-2
start . . . Speaking of starts, Rutgers is 6-1, its best seven-game
showing since the 1982-83 season . . . Rutgers freshman Rashod Kent
leads the country in field goal percentage . . . What's with all
these upsets and near upsets by have-nots against haves? Florida
Atlantic beat Oklahoma State at home, and earlier this week, 1-8
Pan American nearly beat No. 12 New Mexico at The Pit in
Albuquerque . . . West Virginia is involved in a major rebuilding
plan. The Mountaineers lost their first six players from a year
ago. Through eight games this season, coach Gale Catlett has used
eight players in the starting lineup. Going into the season,
Catlett had only one player on his roster who had started a college
game . . . Say what you will about Indiana coach Bob Knight, but
it's hard to argue with his success, his graduation rate, and the
clean reputation of the Hoosier program. Knight reached the
1,000-game career mark against Kentucky Tuesday. His teams have
compiled a 728-272 record . . . People should start paying more
attention to the Mid-American Conference. Check what has happened
already: Toledo over Xavier; Miami of Ohio over Tennessee; Ohio
University over Syracuse; Ball State and Western Michigan over
Michigan.

BOX SET SHOWS XTC'S ODDBALL GENUIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than 20 years ago, before there were raves and designer
drugs, there was this English pop band, XTC. Speaking with the
Globe six years ago, singer-guitarist Andy Partridge explained the
genesis of the moniker and how he came to loathe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I picked the name because I thought it was a pictogram for the
group in 1975. It was short, sharp, shocking. It was immediate
gratification and wonderfulness. The letters were the right shape.
It leapt out in print.'' Alas, Partridge soon came to believe ``we
were stuck with one of those classic `punny' names that are great
fun for a week and then you think, `Why did we choose that name?'
You sober up and go `Oh no! We're called that?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but Partridge and his sole remaining XTC mate,
singer-bassist Colin Moulding, can rest easy. XTC, which has just
released a 52-track, four-CD box set called ``Transistor Blast''
(TVT, $44.99), has weathered the storms of time well. They are one
of the hip influences to cite in the modern rock world (see: Baby
Ray) and there is an added air of mystery about them because . . .
well, they essentially pulled the plug on themselves as a live band
in 1982 following Partridge's nervous breakdown, sparked by his
stage fright. (They did play acoustic radio gigs in 1989 _ some of
those tracks surface here.)
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing like a disappearing act to foster a myth.
Consider this, too: They went on what you might call a strike in
1992, following their last studio disc, ``Nonsuch.'' Throughout the
decade, they'd attempted to extricate themselves from what they saw
as a draconian contract with Virgin. (They're out of it _ finally;
XTC releases an album of new material early next year, ``Apple
Venus'' on TVT.)
</P>
<P>
   The early XTC had a string of hits in England and made a couple
of dents in new wave America with ``Life Begins at the Hop'' and
``Making Plans for Nigel.'' Now, the term ``new wave'' is most
often spoken with disdain. People think of silly costumes, garish
videos, and diluted punk rock. The best of new wave, however, took
punk's energy and lashed to it an inventive spirit _ melodically,
rhythmically, harmonically _ that gave the music a complex
resonance that went beyond punk's heavy hammer. This is where XTC
lived during its 1977-1982 heyday, and it's where they live again
on ``Transistor Blast,'' culled from concerts and BBC radio
sessions over the years. (XTC made 15 albums and some very strong
work exists post-'82, especially the ``English Settlement'' album.)
</P>
<P>
   Though recorded live, these ``Transistor'' takes are crisp,
uncluttered, almost pristine _ without being antiseptic. The discs
are not peppered with pointless call-and-response queries from the
band or riddled with gone-bonkers applause from the crowd. It's all
very well mannered. Writes Partridge in the booklet that
accompanies the CD package, of the first BBC concert disc: ``The
audience, being allowed to eavesdrop by a stern but kindly auntie,
never seemed to be given permission to `get into it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   XTC took naturally its oddball status. The band was too pop for
punk, too quirky for power pop; too giddy for post-punk, too sly
for the New Romantic movement.
</P>
<P>
   As such, none of what XTC, which then included guitarist Dave
Gregory and keyboardist Barry Andrews, has recorded here sounds
dated or quaint or, God forbid, stereotypically new wavey. XTC has
always gone for the baroque, the detailed, in as much as did the
Beatles 'round about ``Rubber Soul'' and ``Sgt. Pepper.'' XTC plied
this trade before any psychedelic revival took hold. Add to this
off-kilter framework a certain wry, arch, very English sensibility
not unlike the Kinks' Ray Davies. The result is a slew of multiply
hooked, clever pop-rock songs made by guys who knew enough about
the rule book to toss it away when called for.
</P>
<P>
   Partridge has likened that early period to XTC being sorcerer's
apprentices, lucky enough to work in an alchemist's kitchen. On the
other end of that, we're lucky to have these artifacts. No dust on
'em at all.

`TEMPEST' STARTS STRONG, BUT PETERS OUT; FONDA IS WARMLY
EFFECTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oprah Winfrey isn't the only production megalith trying to bring
``important'' stories to American audiences. The entire TV-movie
division at NBC has committed itself to familiarizing American
audiences with classic stories from literature.
</P>
<P>
   Such noble resolve was easy to muster given the success of
``Gulliver's Travels'' and, more recently, ``The Odyssey'' and
``Merlin.'' But, just as Oprah and ABC discovered with ``David and
Lisa'' last month, NBC learned in October with ``Crime and
Punishment'' that America likes to take its literary medicine with
a little bit of sweetener.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, after ``Crime and Punishment'' attracted an even smaller
audience than NBC expected, the network's cheese trust decided to
pull ``The Tempest'' from its November schedule, fearful of
exposing a literary classic to mass indifference during an
important ratings period. In the obscurity of mid-December, ``The
Tempest'' will now be considered a success if it merely makes a
dent against ``The X-Files'' on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was a wise one. Though hardly a disaster, this
``Tempest'' is a morality play that works well for an hour or so,
and then begins to crumble in an allegorical war story that is more
confusing than enlightening. The result: A nice try, but not
completely satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   NBC is resting its hopes here on Peter Fonda, who brings to
``The Tempest'' the quiet intensity that got him an Oscar
nomination for his portrayal of a stoic Southern beekeeper in
``Ulee's Gold.''
</P>
<P>
   Fonda remains in the deep South for this earnest ``update'' of
Shakespeare's last play, transitioning smoothly from swarms to
storms. In the telling by ``Attica'' screenwriter Jim Henerson,
Prospero, duke of Milan, becomes Gideon Prosper, Mississippi
plantation owner.
</P>
<P>
   Fonda's Prosper is a kind-hearted man who loses interest in his
plantation after the death of his wife. He prefers to dabble in
magic and sorcery under the tutelage of a slave named Ezeli
(Donzaleigh Abernathy), leaving everyday business to his scoundrel
brother, Anthony (John Glover).
</P>
<P>
   Bad idea. Glover's Anthony is as nasty as the devil (which
Glover plays every Friday on ``Brimstone''). Gideon ends up exiled
to a bayou treehouse with his daughter, Miranda (Katherine Heigl),
and Ezeli's orphaned son, Ariel (Harold Perrineau Jr.). After 12
years, he's gotten pretty good at the magic, better still at
playing the hermit and instilling wholesome values in Miranda and
Ariel.
</P>
<P>
   While marginally faithful to Shakespeare's story, ``The
Tempest'' never achieves the dynamic impact implicit in the title,
even with the Civil War as a backdrop. Fonda is warmly effective as
the loving father who can whip up a storm at will and who wrestles
with questions of loyalty, independence, honor and duty. Heigl is
fresh and appealing as the daughter who's never known anything but
a sheltered life away from civilization.
</P>
<P>
   Special visual effects by the Frame Store, which also handled
``Gulliver,'' ``Odyssey'' and ``Merlin,'' are impressive. But, in
serving us Bard Lite, NBC has only made it obvious that ``less
filling'' doesn't work well in drama.
</P>
<P>
   The Tempest. A retelling of Shakespeare's mystical story of
honor and betrayal. Starring Peter Fonda, John Glover, Katherine
Heigl and Harold Perrineau Jr. Sunday night on NBC. Parental
guideline rating: TV-14.

EAST GERMANS ADMIT DOPING; AMERICANS WANT THEIR MEDALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shirley Babashoff should have been America's golden girl at the
1976 Summer Olympics. Holland's Enith Brigitha would have been the
first black swimming champion. Canada could have won three gold
medals instead of zero.
</P>
<P>
   If only the International Olympic Committee had known then what
everybody knows now _ that East Germany had pumped its teenage
swimmers full of steroids _ it could have rearranged the medal
stand and rewritten the record books.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after a decade of admissions by former GDR coaches,
doctors, and swimmers and findings in two recent German criminal
trials, the Americans want what they believe they were cheated out
of 22 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Appropriate medal recognition,'' says US Olympic Committee
president William Hybl, who has asked the IOC executive committee
to revisit history when it meets this weekend in Lausanne,
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Since a German court has found that medley relay swimmer Andrea
Pollack Pinske was doped before the Montreal Games, the USOC wants
the American quartet of Linda Jezek, Lauri Siering, Camille Wright,
and Babashoff, plus alternates Wendy Boglioli and Lelei Fonoimoana,
to be upgraded from silver to gold.
</P>
<P>
   Though director general Francois Carrard has said the IOC would
consider awarding medals on a case-by-case basis if presented with
``conclusive evidence'' that the East Germans were doped, the Lords
of the Rings fear they would be opening themselves up for a global
migraine, with hundreds of athletes from dozens of countries
demanding medals they believe they should have won.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every once in a while, we've looked at the issue
hypothetically,'' says Richard Pound, an IOC vice president who
swam for Canada in the 1960 Games at Rome. ``But it's just a
nightmare when you try to rejigger what you think might have been
history. For the IOC to step in and make these God-like decisions
as to who should have gotten what . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   Though the USOC is requesting medals for only one event at one
Olympics, nobody believes it will stop there. Since Petra
Kind-Schneider has admitted that she was doped before the 1980
Games in Moscow, the British are asking that Sharron Davies be
given a gold medal in the 400-meter individual medley.
</P>
<P>
   Even if East Germany had doped only female swimmers before the
1976 Games, the upgrade list for beaten rivals would number more
than three dozen. But signed admissions from former East German
coaches and detailed medical records kept by the Stasi, the GDR's
secret police, show that their elite swimmers were doped for years.
</P>
<P>
   US Swimming, which has been monitoring German trials and media
reports for the better part of two years, has a list of 25 American
women and several men it believes are entitled to Olympic makeup
medals.
</P>
<P>
   And the GDR didn't merely dope swimmers. State Plan 1425
eventually required it for every sport but sailing. Since East
Germany won 409 summer medals and 110 winter medals in 24 sports
between 1968 (its first Olympic year on its own) and 1988 (its last
as a nation), the IOC's potential caseload is staggering. ``It's
just a bottomless swamp,'' muses Pound. ``You wander in and you're
never seen again.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
A difficult case to prove
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The IOC has been quick to redistribute medals when athletes are
caught doping at the Games _ Carl Lewis got a gold after Ben
Johnson was stripped in Seoul a decade ago. And the USOC (which
will honor the swimmers in some way, no matter what the IOC does)
isn't asking that the East Germans' medals be taken away. ``Their
women were victims, too,'' says Hybl. ``They were told they were
being given vitamins.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, no East German ever tested positive in any sport at any
Olympics. So while they may not have been innocent, they weren't
found guilty at the time. And IOC vice president Jacques Rogge said
in October that it would need to be proved that the swimmers were
doped on the day they competed.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, who can be sure that their beaten rivals weren't doped,
too? ``It may be that we say, `Look, the chapter is closed,' ''
Pound muses. ``It's a quarter-century away, and what we have to do
now is get the genie back in the bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that doping began with the GDR. Thomas Hicks, the American
who inherited the 1904 marathon gold medal after teammate Fred Lorz
was disqualified for riding 11 miles in a truck, was drugged
repeatedly during the race with sulfate of strychnine and cognac.
</P>
<P>
   But the East Germans were the first to dope athletes universally
and systematically as a matter of state policy _ to prove that
communism was superior to capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   Though the GDR had a population the size of New York State's in
a country the size of Ohio, it leapfrogged past the United States
in the Olympic medal standings in one quadrennium. The American
swimmers, who had their heads handed to them by the East Germans at
the 1973 world meet in Budapest, were the first to sense that
something was odd.
</P>
<P>
   The GDR hadn't won a single women's gold medal at the 1972
Olympics; it won 11 at the worlds. ``It was just too much of a
quantum leap for one country to be making,'' says US Olympic coach
Mark Schubert, who was Babashoff's club coach.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1976 Games, the East Germans held virtually every women's
world record. They blew the rest of the planet out of the water in
Montreal, taking every race but the 200-meter breaststroke and
freestyle relay and winning 18 medals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew the East Germans were using drugs,'' says Karen
``Moe'' Thornton, who had won the 200-meter butterfly in 1972 but
finished fourth in 1976 despite swimming nearly three seconds
faster. ``But you couldn't really talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Americans observed that the Kornelias and Petras and
Ulrikes looked more like men than women, they were dismissed as
poor sports. Babashoff, who finished a frustrated and bewildered
second to East Germans in three individual races, was labeled
``Surly Shirley.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those accusations hurt her,'' says Schubert. ``Shirley was the
only person who had the guts to speak up about what we all knew was
going on.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
The lid comes off
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until 1989, when the Berlin Wall came down and the two
Germanies subsequently merged, that everyone found out what had
been going on.
</P>
<P>
   The Stasi files, which meticulously detailed which athletes had
been given which drugs how often, were confiscated and made public.
Twenty coaches admitted in writing that they had doped their
swimmers during the '70s and '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Pollack Pinske, Christiane Knacke-Sommer, and Carola
Nitschke-Beraktschjan all offered to give back their Olympic or
world medals. Knacke-Sommer said Kornelia Ender and Barbara Krause,
both multiple Olympic gold medalists, were drugged. Rica Reinisch,
Daniela Hunger, and Kind-Schneider, who won eight Olympic medals
among them, all said they were doped. Stasi documents showed that
Olympic champions Kristin Otto and Heike Friedrich were also
drugged. And court evidence lists Olympic medalist Manuela
Stellmach and world champions Sylvia Gerasch and Birgit Meineke.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the results from four Olympiads (the GDR boycotted the
1984 Games in Los Angeles) were tarnished. Swimming World magazine
last year ran a two-part series (``The Way Things Should Have
Been'') and began pushing for makeup medals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides Babashoff and all the other Americans on down, there
was Brigitha and the Canadians,'' says Phil Whitten, Swimming
World's editor-in-chief. ``Though the Canadians were lambasted by
their press for their poor showing in Montreal, it was actually
their best. But what happened to them affected the enthusiasm and
funding for swimming in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the German government began a series of trials charging
former GDR swimming officials with committing bodily injury on
minors, the compensation push began in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   US Swimming asked a German lawyer to monitor the trials and
hired Colorado Springs attorney Rich Young to compile a list of any
former East German swimmers who turned up in court transcripts and
media reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Insinuation, rumor, innuendo, hearsay _ that's not the
standard we're looking for,'' says Hybl. ``We want conclusive proof
_ confessions and convictions.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the trials are over (and there may be half a dozen
more), the USOC could be asking for a basketful of medals. Counting
individual events and relays, Kornelia Ender, who won four gold
medals in 1976, affected eight American swimmers. Otto, who won a
record six golds at Seoul, affected a dozen.
</P>
<P>
   Odds are that the IOC will turn over the medal issue to its
juridical commission until the trials are over _ whenever that is.
``We don't want to be seen as interfering or anticipatory,'' says
Pound.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, the Lords of the Rings are unlikely to wade into the
bottomless swamp, handing out medals to grievants. ``It's a mess,''
concedes Pound. ``I don't know what the right thing to do is.''
</P>
<P>
   The right thing might be a makeup medal. It might be membership
in the Olympic Order, which was the consolation prize US boxer Roy
Jones got last year for being jobbed in Seoul. It might be a formal
letter of acknowledgement. It might be an asterisk in the record
book. And it might simply be a massive commitment to finally put
the drug genie back in the bottle.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever it is, Babashoff and her relay mates can't ever get
what they wanted _ their moment atop the medal stand, hearing the
anthem and watching the Stars and Stripes go up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't up there,'' Camille Wright says, 22 years later.
``You can't get that moment back.''

IT'S TOO LATE FOR OLYMPIC LOSERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Camille Wright remembers the first time she saw the East German
swimmers up close. ``It was at a workout before our dual meet with
them in California in 1975,'' she says. ``I was walking behind the
blocks and they were already in the water with their backs to us. I
thought, `Those guys are huge.' And then I saw a strap and I said,
`Oh my God, those are the girls.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The GDR madchen had massive shoulders and deep voices, and they
swam ungodly fast. Not just one or two of them. Eight or nine. ``We
knew in our hearts,'' says Wendy Boglioli. ``Everyone knew that
something was not right.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the world knows that the East Germans were pumped up on
steroids, that the results from the 1976 and 1980 and 1988 Olympic
Games are tainted. ``I wish they would have been caught 20 years
ago,'' says Wright.
</P>
<P>
   If they had been, Wright would have won a gold medal in the
medley relay and a silver in the 100-meter butterfly. Boglioli
would have had three golds. And Shirley Babashoff, who had also won
three medals in 1972, would have had five golds, the most ever by
an American female at one Games. ``Her life really would have been
different,'' muses Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Babashoff, who was 19 that year, quit swimming the next winter.
She's now a 41-year-old single mother who delivers mail in
Huntington Beach, Calif., not far from where she grew up. She has
an unlisted number, skips reunions with her former teammates, and
rarely talks about what happened _ or didn't happen _ in Montreal.
And she won't be checking her mailbox for makeup medals from
Lausanne.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is going to happen,'' Babashoff told the Orange County
Register last summer. ``To me, this happened a long time ago. It's
like beating a dead horse. People have talked for 22 years.''
</P>
<P>
   By now, Babashoff and her teammates have long since dealt with
losing to ``guys.'' They say they feel sorry for their East German
rivals, who may not have known that the ``vitamins'' they were
force-fed were steroids. Some of them now have health problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just kids,'' says Boglioli. ``They didn't know what
they were taking. They did what they were told. But whether they
knew it or not, those aren't the right times. The medals don't
belong to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, after comparing the times from their Olympic
trials with those of the East Germans, were resigned to getting
hammered even before they went to Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no discussion of, well, let's suck it up and beat
them, anyway,'' says Karen ``Moe'' Thornton, who captained the team
with Boglioli. ``A lot of people felt we really couldn't beat them,
that they'd accomplished as much as they could by making the team.
I couldn't do anything to change that. It was an awkward dynamic.''
</P>
<P>
   When the GDR medley relay demolished the Americans in the
opening race, breaking the world record by more than five seconds,
the tone for the week was set. Except for the 200-meter
breaststroke, which the Soviet Union swept, the East Germans didn't
lose a race until the finale.
</P>
<P>
   When Babashoff and her mates set a world mark to win the
freestyle relay, they were giddy with disbelief. ``It was something
beyond our wildest dreams,'' says Boglioli, who swam the second
leg. ``Nobody expected anything from us from day one. But we all
went above and beyond what everyone could do.''
</P>
<P>
   That should have been the capper to a golden week for the US
women. Instead, they went home feeling like failures. ``The men's
team (12 of 13 golds and 11 world records) did really great,''
Wright says. ``And it was: `What happened to you guys? You got
killed.' And we did get killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, at least, the world knows why. That's a source of
satisfaction for the Class of 1976. ``It's something positive for
kids to see,'' says Boglioli. ``That even if it takes this long,
you're going to get caught.''
</P>
<P>
   And though they're not counting on getting makeup medals, they
wouldn't mind something in the record book acknowledging that the
GDR results were chemically enhanced. ``I'd be in favor of an
asterisk,'' says Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Yet no consolation prize can make up for what happened at
Olympus, not just in Montreal but in Moscow in 1980 and Seoul in
1988. ``You can't rewrite history,'' says Thornton. ``You can't
turn back the clock and redo events. It's just the way it was. For
three quadrennials, the best athletes weren't rewarded.''

STAR TREK: INSURRECTION 
Directed by: Jonathan Frakes 
Screenplay by: Michael Piller 
Starring: Patrick Stewart, Frakes, Brent Spiner, LeVar Burton,
Michael Dorn, Gates McFadden, Marina Sirtis, F. Murray Abraham,
Donna Murphy, Anthony Zerbe, Gregg Henry, Daniel Hugh-Kelly 
Running time: 103 minutes 
Rated: PG (sci-fi action violence, mild language, and sensuality) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Star Trek: Insurrection'' is the ninth in the series, but
who's counting? What's important to Trekkies in particular and
moviegoers in general is that the successors to the late ``Star
Trek'' founder Gene Roddenberry have got the mix right for the big
screen after a few clunky missteps, and are keeping it on track. On
the one hand, the latest installment goes places Roddenberry never
could in terms of special effects. Beefed up with the latest
computer-generated imagery, the new installment featuring the new
generation is on a new frontier of technology. On the other hand,
``Star Trek: Insurrection'' wisely stays true to the simple
morality tales that have always been the core of the series's
appeal. The planets are always new, at least nominally. But the
stories play out like familiar rituals, and this latest entry
reassuringly provides more of the same.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Star Trek: Insurrection'' boasts the last word in
explosions and outer-space fireworks, its charm derives from a
setting that makes no effort to disguise the fact that it happens
to be in the Sierra Nevada of California. It's called the Ba'ku
planet in the film, but it disarmingly suggests a sort of hippie
Shangri-La, much like Ewok country in ``Return of the Jedi,''
populated by peaceful people in homespun garments, using
technology-shunning handmade implements, soon up to their gentle
eyeballs in imported aggression. First, Brent Spiner's
scene-stealing android, Data, runs amok. Then Patrick Stewart's
Captain Picard finds himself double-crossed by the Federation's
moldy, prunelike allies on what he thought was a cultural survey.
</P>
<P>
   But no. The wrinkled Son'a unit, headed by F. Murray Abraham,
with the clothes sense of Darth Vader's boss and never more in need
of a facial, wants to take the planet over for itself. Meanwhile,
Picard learns that the hippies not only are not what they seem, but
are not as young as they seem. They have landed on a
fountain-of-youth planet, and the Son'a want it. What ensues before
the inevitable climactic computer-generated big bang is the usual
endearing agonizing over the morality of disobeying the
Federation's prime directive of never interfering with the lives of
civilizations on other planets. It's spiced by dialogue rich in
pseudoscientific terminology, such as metaphasic radiation _ a key
plot point, you'll be happy to learn. It's hard not to get behind
the moral debates. How many other sci-fi fireworks movies even
bother with morality, as ``Star Trek,'' plain or now fancy, does?
</P>
<P>
   It isn't just about good guys and bad guys; it's also about
values. ``Star Trek'' isn't afraid to be a little square. But
that's all it needs to win anew its audience of hard-core Trekkies,
aging hippies, incipient hippies, and latter-day fans brought on
board by the revitalized ``Next Generation'' TV series. The
direction by Jonathan Frakes, who plays Picard's second in command,
is knowing, if a bit pedestrian. Stewart has never looked better,
or better prepared for Picard's heroics. Possibly it's because
Picard is smitten with one of the planet's inhabitants, Donna
Murphy's Ba'ku grande dame, who's able simultaneously to project
soft allure and timeless wisdom, enough at least to keep Spiner's
Data from walking away with the movie yet again, just as Leonard
Nimoy's Spock used to do. With ``Star Trek: Insurrection,'' the
franchise continues to prosper.

WHAT'S BEST FOR HAIRLINE CRACKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, December 13, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My 30-year-old house had settlement cracks in a ceiling and a
wall recently. I applied joint compound and paper tape, to prevent
them from recurring. Well, they did, cracking right through the
tape. I'd like to retape, but should I dig out the cracks to be a
little wider than the hairlines there now? Is there an alternative?
</P>
<P>
   JOE CRIVELLO, Duxbury, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. If cracks appeared within the last few years, they are not
from settlement, because the house has done all the settling within
a few years of its building. The cracks are from expansion and
contraction of the wall and ceiling as they gain and lose moisture.
</P>
<P>
   If you retape, remove the old tape and compund and open the
cracks 1/8 to 1/4 inch wide, and as deep as the plasterboard. Apply
a self-adhesive nylon mesh tape of the type used when Blueboard is
skimcoated. Then fill the crack with joint compound, pressing right
through the tape, and spread it thinly on each side; this will
allow the compound to key into the crack rather than sitting on the
surface. Apply a thin coat over the tape, and after that dries,
apply two more thin layers of compound, letting it dry between
coats. Sand and repaint.
</P>
<P>
   Nylon mesh tape is designed to resist the stress of expanding
and contracting materials.
</P>
<P>
   Or, try this easier method, which might work as well or better.
Remove the tape and old compound. Buy PhenoSeal, a flexible
adhesive caulk in a caulking cartridge. Run a bead of this on the
crack and press it in with your fingers. This flexible caulk is the
only thing that can be forced into a hairline crack; you could
widen it a bit, but that might not be necessary. Scrape off excess
with a putty knife and clean residue with a wet sponge. The caulk
will expand and contract with the movement of the wall/ceiling and
keep the crack from reappearing.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I moved into a new house, a condo in September, and noticed a
crack in the basement concrete floor. It is not leaking. The
contractor is willing to come back and fill it with mortar. Will
that solve the problem?
</P>
<P>
   JIM FOGARTY, Chelmsford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. There is no problem to fix, because unreinforced concrete
like your floor is born to crack, sooner or later. Patching would
be cosmetic, unless you are getting water up those cracks.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How can I maintain and clean newly-polyurethaned floors? How
about scuff marks?
</P>
<P>
   FRAN OLFE, Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Dry-mopping and vacuuming will keep the floor clean. For
stubborn spots, damp-mop with water, but only damp, not wet. For
scuff marks, put a little oil on the marks, wait 10 minutes, and
wipe clean. For stubborn scuff marks, scrub lightly with Brillo or
SOS pads.

   Where to get rubber roof material to patch a gouge? That is what
Arthur Rosenberg of West Newton wanted to know recently. The
handyman did not know, so he put it up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   One type is called Low Slope, which Charles Radin of Brookline,
Mass. used to fix a leak in a small section of his roof. It is
available through Beacon Sales, 50 Webster Ave., Somerville; Mass.,
phone 617-666-2800.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Montenegro of Randolph, Mass. called to say that her
husband is a roofer, and gave this warning about rubber roofs:
``You should not use any kind of adhesive other than rubber roof
adhesive; others could corrode the rubber. A primer is required; it
is called Hexaprene. You have to use a seam tape to seal the
material. The materials (from Harvey Industries, and R&AMP;R Sales in
Dorchester) are sold only to pros. But you could call my husband,
Patricio Montenegro in Randolph.''

   Q. The new painted shingles on my 1993 addition were covered
with mildew last spring; the painter washed it off with bleach and
water, but in autumn it came back worse than ever. The painted
shingles on the old part of the house are free of mildew. Why is
there such a difference between the old and new?
</P>
<P>
   CYNTHIA CARTER, West Roxbury, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. If the new shingles were white cedar and then painted, they
were uncured, or full of water; the moisture kept coming, and
mildew thrives on moisture. The shingles on the old part of the
house were dry, having less chance of getting wet; hence little or
no mildew.
</P>
<P>
   Keep going with the solution of one part bleach and three parts
water; you will have to do this wherever and whenever the mildew
appears. You can use an additive for the bleach to be more
effective longer; one is Pittsburgh Pants' Mildew-Proof, sold in
paint stores, and another is Jomax, wich is mixed with bleach and
water. Made by Zehring of Portland, Ore., it may be available in
paint stores.

THE DEMOCRATS' MR. POPULIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The last person you want to fight is the one who has nothing
to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Which is reason enough to keep an eye on Paul Wellstone, the
Minnesota senator running for the Democratic presidential
nomination. He'll be in it, and he doesn't give a hoot who else
gets in the fray. He is the most dangerous kind of opponent in
politics. Because he's a man on a mission.
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone is the George McGovern of 1972, the Jimmy Carter of
1976, the Paul Tsongas of 1992. He carries a cause, not just a
candidacy. I'm not saying he'll win the nomination; I'd be shocked
if he did.
</P>
<P>
   But he burns with a clear blue flame, as the true-blue lefty in
the field. He's a professor, a crusader, a born-again-and-again
out-and-out left-wing redistribute-the-wealth guy. He'll pitch to
the liberal band of the Democrats' spectrum, which typically loves
the purest liberal. Democratic primaries always leave room for a
cause candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore is the prohibitive favorite; all the
Republican insiders I talk to are convinced Gore will be their
quarry. Senators or ex-senators much taller than Wellstone, with
medals (Bob Kerrey and John Kerry) from war or medals (Olympic)
from basketball (Bill Bradley), paw the turf in Iowa and New
Hampshire. Wellstone, reelected to a second term with barely 51
percent of the vote, is probably the weakest on paper. But his
earnest prairie populism, dogged bread-and-butter politics, prudent
and penny-pinching guerrilla campaign style, will appeal to the
young and the sandal-wearers, two Democratic constituencies not to
be sneezed at in early states.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to represent the democratic wing of the Democratic
Party,'' he once cracked in a forum. It got a laugh, and his
baiting of big-money politicians will get lots of laughs. He may be
the conscience of the early debates who'll generate sparks before
he's shouldered aside by big money and brawnier candidacies, with
more centrist messages.
</P>
<P>
   Washington and the big media will be the last to get the word on
Wellstone: too earnest, too short, too Jewish, too sincere; a real
hair shirt who's always whining about the poor and left-behind,
when the others want to talk about the Dow Jones hurdling 9,000 and
the shrimp at Barbra Streisand's house.
</P>
<P>
   But there are farm families in Iowa who'll succumb to the same
pitch he's used to woo votes in Minnesota's Iron Range. There are
voters in New Hampshire now who don't yet know his name who'll be
holding Wellstone signs a year from today.
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone's father, a Russian immigrant who wanted to be the
next Chekhov, was an editorial writer for The Boston Transcript who
quit over that newspaper's isolationist turn. Felix Frankfurter
helped his dad land a job in D.C. with the Voice of America. Paul,
a scrappy high school wrestler, went to the University of North
Carolina, wrestling at 126 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Another Minnesota wrestler-turned-populist-pol, Governor-elect
Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura, ran into Wellstone at a recent match of
the University of Minnesota. ``I told Jesse `This is the real
thing,' '' grinned Wellstone on a recent Boston visit with his
wife, Sheila, a child development specialist. Ventura's victory was
a ``stick-it-to-the-establishment'' development, he said, where
same-day voter registration helped ``The Body.'' The Internet
played a key role in Ventura's astonishing victory last month, and
Wellstone's campaign manager, Dan Lucas, says that shortly you will
be able to make a secure credit-card donation to the Wellstone
cause over the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone prospects via direct mail for contributions averaging
$46 a hit; right now half the money he raises (almost $600,000 to
date) goes back into direct mail. His pitch is simple: ``People who
work hard shouldn't be poor.'' He's convinced his
from-the-ground-up politics sells; ``I was the only senator up for
reelection who voted against the welfare bill.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll remind some of Jerry Brown, Jesse Jackson or Pat Buchanan
in railing against big business, corporate mergers, monopolies. We
don't yet know if the fund-raising scandal will move voters. Al
Gore will be the Democrats' money magnet _ and magnate.
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone: ``I want to get the big money out and the people back
in.'' Few Democrats recall now that in 1972, when former vice
presidential candidate Edmund Muskie of Maine was the prohibitive
Democratic favorite to tackle President Nixon, McGovern used the
money issue to lick Muskie.
</P>
<P>
   McGovern's big issue was Vietnam, but Muskie initially refused
to disclose names of wealthy contributors who had given him secret
contributions, which were then legal. Muskie claimed, justifiably,
that Nixon's henchmen were wreaking revenge on Democratic
contributors. But McGovern's attack helped fuel the surge that
brought McGovern within 12 percent of the wobbly frontrunner in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   If the stink over the Clinton-Gore fund-raising escapades
catches on as an issue, Wellstone might have a McGovern-style
opening. But Gore's image as Mr. Green/Mr. Clean may withstand his
rivals' bids to remind voters of Buddhist nuns bearing thousand
dollar gifts, and overnights for the well-heeled in the Lincoln
Bedroom. Wellstone claims he can ``ju-jitsu big money when it comes
at me.'' The old 126-pound college rassler will have the chance to
prove that.

<TEXT>
<P>
   So what's become of the dozens of East German coaches and
doctors who doped their swimmers for nearly two decades? Most of
them are still working in clubs in reunified Germany. And one of
them, Winfried Leopold, headed the German team at this year's world
championships _ until the international federation pulled his
accreditation after he admitted he gave steroids to GDR swimmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only ones who've been banned have either admitted what
they did or been convicted in a court of law,'' says Swimming World
editor-in-chief Phil Whitten, who has documented the sport's doping
problems for much of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches Rolf Glaeser, Volker Frischke, Dieter Lindemann, and
Dieter Krause and doctors Bernd Pansold and Dieter Binus, who all
worked for the Dynamo Berlin club, were convicted and fined this
year for causing bodily harm to minors.
</P>
<P>
   More coaches and doctors are expected to stand trial next year
as the German government continues its club-by-club investigation
of doping abuses in the former GDR.

HOLIDAYS A LA MARTHA: YOUR GOOSE IS ...BOUGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So I was working on my Martha's Calendar the other day _ you
know, the one in the Martha Stewart Living magazine that we who are
organizationally challenged need so desperately. There are many
entries for outdoor types who just can't get enough Martha.
</P>
<P>
   Martha, you see, is an outdoorswoman extraordinaire, though she
adds these wonderful Martha touches to give her pursuits a kind of
Martha-does-Orvis panache.
</P>
<P>
   For example, there was the famous Halloween canoe ride a couple
of years back, which Martha immortalized on the cover of her
magazine. Martha herself _ dressed, I think, in widewhale corduroys
and a beige cashmere sweater wrapped in a loose, studied way about
her shoulders _ was just pushing off in her canoe for an adventure.
In my mind's eye, here's how the picture remains:
</P>
<P>
   Martha and a golden retriever are just pushing off in the canoe,
perhaps into the Connecticut River somewhere around East Lyme or
Hamburg Cove. Somewhere in the canoe, there must be a wicker picnic
basket _ for all or at least most of Martha's outdoor adventures
involve wicker picnic baskets.
</P>
<P>
   Where the golden retriever is in relation to the wicker picnic
basket, I cannot recall. And that is probably because of the
stunning central focus of this cover shot. On the bow of that
canoe, propped miraculously (and there must be a registered
trademark for the MarthaBracket invented to mount it), is a
candlelit pumpkin with a leering jack o' lantern face carved in it.
</P>
<P>
   It got me thinking back to a few of the canoe trips I have
taken, and I was trying to remember one when I could have paddled 5
yards without the candle in that pumpkin going out. Or perhaps the
pumpkin itself falling off its perch in the bow, and maybe
depositing the candle with that hot wax on the wicker picnic basket
or the golden retriever's paw.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, I was then, and remain to this day, spellbound by Martha
in her role as outdoorswoman, which is why I was perusing her
bimonthly calendar in the first place. (But do not climb Mt.
Everest with any of her friends, though that is another story.)
</P>
<P>
   On the Dec. 4 Martha's entry is ``Have dogs groomed.'' One of
those dogs must be the retriever. I'm wondering if he's being
groomed before or after he plods around in the marsh mud retrieving
a bagged seaduck, or perhaps a Canada goose.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, would you actually have your retriever groomed in
December, with waterfowl season open? Or would you wait until Dec.
15, next Tuesday, when the season ends?
</P>
<P>
   But here we find on the 15th Martha is ordering her Christmas
goose from the butcher, a fact I found stunning. Any home ec
overachiever who would grow the corn for her own corn muffins must
surely not accept a butcher's version of the Christmas goose.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Martha has let me down. My heart is hardened to the fact
that on Jan. 5, she is having her gardening equipment serviced, or
that on the 25th, she will refill the wood bin. Because I have a
sneaky idea that in Martha's fireplace is actually one of those
propane jets that keep you from getting all those bark chips in
your house.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the real bottom-line entry in the Martha Stewart
calendar is Jan. 28. That's the day she makes an appointment with
her tax accountant.
</P>
<P>
   And that leaves me out on the marsh with a nice big Canada goose
to bring home for Christmas dinner, but no Martha advice on what to
do next. I mean, goose raises many problems, No. 1 of which is
goose grease. I'm sure somewhere in the Martha lexicon is something
about how to rub goose grease on your deck shoes, but that doesn't
help in the preparation.
</P>
<P>
   From the time you're standing there with your 12-pound goose to
the time it appears on the Christmas table, there is much to do.
Actually, Martha's market goose will have a lot more grease to deal
with than the wild goose, which has much less fat, especially if it
is a newly arrived migrant from the Canadian Maritimes.
</P>
<P>
   You must hang your goose for at least 24 hours and better a
week, and of course, plucking the goose may dampen your desire to
shoot your own Christmas goose again. It is a project. But if you
insist on saving the whole bird, truss it and roast it like a
turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with that is, when you shoot your goose, you're not
quite sure of its age, and after a couple of years, a Canada
becomes an unlikely candidate for roasting. Too tough. Roast only
the young birds, which will probably be closer to 6 pounds than 10.
</P>
<P>
   It's a better idea to breast out a big bird, which gets you past
the plucking chores, too. The breast and upper legs should then be
marinated in ginger lime or teriyaki, sliced, then barbecued like
any piece of steak or chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Another preparation is to heat a sauce of butter and onions in a
heavy casserole, drop in browned slices of goose, and simmer with a
little lemon, allspice, and red wine for about half an hour (check
tenderness).
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere in the Martha Stewart lexicon are there preparations for
this fine form of wild goose, nor is there an entry for going over
the hanging ducks carefully to remove shot with the point of your
knife.

KRAFT GOES TO CONN...KEEPS THE CON GOING

   The Connecticut Yahoos will not be discouraged. Fork over $375
million to make a rich guy richer? . . . No problem. Build it on a
toxic waste dump? . . . Pass the shovels. Pay for seats that Bob
Kraft can't sell? . . . Have some more cash, Bob. Ram it through
the legislature before anybody notices what a crummy deal this is?
. . . Pass the pompoms.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut isn't the Nutmeg State. It's the Nutbag State.
Apparently, these folks will do anything to think of themselves as
major league.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime consumer advocate Ralph Nader isn't fooled. He knows
that Bob Kraft's new playpen is the Corvair of stadium deals. A
citizen of (Winsted) Connecticut, Nader refused to attend
Wednesday's sham hearing in Hartford to discuss the prospective
move of the Patriots. ``I don't believe in entering a whorehouse,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at his Washington office, Nader was asked what he would
have said to Kraft if he had gone to the public hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say, `What quantity of shame do you have in your soul,
Mr. Kraft? Go back to Massachusetts.'
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a lucky month for him,'' added Nader. ``The
officials gave him a game and (Governor John) Rowland gives him
Connecticut.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's rigged hearing came on the heels of Tuesday's
nauseating pep rally. Bob took Chad Eaton, Bruce Armstrong, and
Press Corner Tebucky Jones to Hartford's Civic Center Mall for the
lame-o rally. Old Papa Bear Bob once again got all teary-eyed and
said he just felt so welcome. As ever, he talked to the Hartford
Yahoos with total disregard for the loyal fan base back in
Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   Like Roger Clemens, Mo Vaughn, and every other free agent of our
era, Kraft can't bring himself to come out and say, ``It's all
about the money.'' No. He has to make himself sound like a
struggling vendor, seeking a new home for his small operation. We
keep hearing about how much money he's losing, about how much he
overpaid for the team, and about a new stadium being the only way
he can bring a championship team to New England.
</P>
<P>
   I love it when Kraft talks about not making money on his team.
He paid $158 million for the franchise, and it's going to be worth
$450 million if/when he gets this deal in Hartford. Yo, Bob. My
house costs me money every month. But I get to live there. And I do
not expect it to be worth three times what I paid for it over the
course of eight years.
</P>
<P>
   This is not even getting into the fact that Kraft sells out
every game and will get $17 million in expansion money this year.
Oh yes, and let's not forget the multibillion-dollar TV deal the
NFL signed last year. Over the course of the eight-year deal, each
NFL team will average $80 million annually from the networks.
</P>
<P>
   And get this, fellow Bostonians. Kraft wants to make sure that
once he leaves Foxborough, no NFL team is permitted to land
anywhere near Boston in the future. He wants to claim the entire
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he's got the suckers in Connecticut buying the whole
thing, ramming home legislation before anybody reads the fine
print. Those were some mighty softballs they tossed his way
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   God bless the ever-vigilant Nader.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to spend $600 million-$700 million, which is
what it's going to come out to, it's better to spend it repairing
the crumbling Hartford school system,'' said Nader. ``The Patriots
should be renamed `The Freeloaders,' and the new stadium should be
`Taxpayer Stadium.'
</P>
<P>
   ``This is corporate welfare at its worst. It's having
middle-class taxpayers subsidize a stadium for the superrich for 10
days a year. It may pass in the legislature. But they won't be able
to put it behind them. This will be a multipronged thorn stuck in
their throat so they can't spit or swallow. It's such a bad deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought they'd get away with it, and they might. Why not
have the glitter of an NFL team in Hartford? This is fun and games
for the legislators using other people's money.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote is Tuesday. No later. Rowland wants to make sure this
is handled swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's such a good deal, why was it kept secret from May
until after the election?'' said Nader. ``If it's such a good deal,
why rush it? There isn't anything they didn't give away except the
capitol dome.''
</P>
<P>
   And remember, they're not going to Hartford, anyway.
</P>

IN `A SIMPLE PLAN,' DELIGHTFUL COMPLEXITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
A SIMPLE PLAN 
Directed by: Sam Raimi 
Screenplay by: Scott B. Smith (from his novel) 
Starring: Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton, Brent Briscoe, Bridget
Fonda, Jack Walsh, Chelcie Ross, Becky Ann Baker, Gary Cole 
Running time: 123 minutes 
Rated: R (violence and language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``A Simple Plan'' is the holiday movie season's sleeper. It's a
starkly powerful, beautifully controlled, terrifically acted
morality fable, seething with primal forces. It's a ``Treasure of
the Sierra Madre'' transplanted to the snowy Midwest, where
lifelong bonds between brothers _ played by Bill Paxton and Billy
Bob Thornton, with Brent Briscoe as Thornton's sidekick _ are
tested to the breaking point when money unexpectedly comes into
their lives. It also represents a real stretch for director Sam
Raimi, who moves far beyond the genre flair he has displayed on
previous occasions to the shaping of an impressive actors' piece.
</P>
<P>
   As in Raimi's previous films (``Darkman,'' ``The Evil Dead''),
there's plenty of blood, but unlike anything he's ever done, this
is a character-driven piece, with exceptional work by its three
male leads and by Bridget Fonda. Paxton and Thornton tap a mournful
fatefulness as brothers in a Midwestern farm town whose sibling
rivalry is detonated when they and a hunting buddy find a duffel
bag containing $4 million in the fuselage of a crashed plane in a
snowy forest. At first, it seems a windfall. But scarcely have they
finished counting the money than hitherto-latent tensions begin
surfacing.
</P>
<P>
   By local standards, Paxton's Hank is a success. He's educated,
smooth, successful, married. A tidy package, complete with nice
wife (Bridget Fonda), nice house, nice cozy future. Thornton's
Jacob, on the other hand, is retrograde: slightly retarded,
raggedy, living in a shabby apartment in town since the family farm
failed, uneducated, without prospects. Thornton takes a chance,
dancing on the edge of caricature, working with a shaggy wig and a
prosthetic overbite. Jacob, the merest glimpse of him proclaims, is
a loser.
</P>
<P>
   His redneck buddy, Lou (Briscoe), is quicker than Jacob to give
voice to the resentments implicit in the economic and class
differences separating them from Hank. Time and again, your eyes
keep returning to Thornton's Jacob, who is in every way slow, but
soon convinces us that he has lots of soul, and more emotional
intelligence and sensitivity than the other two. Paxton delivers
his subtlest performance ever as a nice guy you want to keep
liking, despite his ever-deepening immersion in corrosive actions.
And Briscoe's redneck sidekick catches all the sourness of
deprivation he feels.
</P>
<P>
   It's a film, in short, that one never knew Raimi had in him.
Given Hank's inclination to simply sit on the money until they can
be sure it's safe to spend, and Jacob's and Lou's impatience to
start spending it to extricate themselves from the economic pits in
which they're mired, rifts develop with what could have been
predictability, but in this case seems inevitability. Raimi uses
the landscape to invoke the primal forces unleashed when the money
triggers greed, deception, and a revelation of how quickly the
fragile bonds linking the three can dissolve.
</P>
<P>
   One thing goes wrong, then another, then there's blood on the
snow, then it's a question of whether the criminals who took the
money in the first place will return looking for it, or whether the
brothers and their neighbor can stick together to somehow bring off
what had seemed a simple plan. It proves anything but as first a
nosy sheriff begins poking around and then a scary stranger comes
to town as the uneasy finders squabble over how to handle the
money.
</P>
<P>
   The film effortlessly nails the texture and flavor of Midwestern
plainness. And Paxton and Thornton plumb and explore the
complicated relationship of the farm-town brothers. At the end,
Thornton's unlikely Jacob rises to something like tragic grandeur.
Although all three deserve Oscar nods, Thornton is the likeliest to
get one. His character is the most vivid and most moving.
Throughout, the characters' concentration never wavers. Nor does
the grave clarity with which Raimi charts the slippage of their
world into chaos. It would be easy to overlook ``A Simple Plan'' in
the glut of holiday movies, but it really is a striking
achievement, partly because Scott B. Smith, who wrote the novel,
wrote the screenplay as well.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Mike Nichols was the first director mentioned in
connection with ``A Simple Plan.'' Now, Raimi has made what many
would think of as a Mike Nichols movie _ penetrating, focused,
wintry internally as well as externally. And ``A Simple Plan'' is
that rarity in a crowded field of movies that contain violence;
it's one of the few films that make you feel the moral weight of
the consequences of that violence. Indeed, it makes you feel the
violence these men start doing to their souls before any of them
reaches for a gun. We feel the men feeling troubled, we feel the
weight of lives in upheaval in a landscape where nature itself is a
character, impassive and unsparing.

DOMINGO BEYOND `PAGLIACCI' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thirty-three years ago the Handel &AMP; Haydn Society's single
performance of Handel's ``Messiah'' presented an unknown young
Mexican tenor soloist who was in town that season to sing in ``La
Boheme'' and Rameau's ``Hippolyte et Aricie'' for Sarah Caldwell
and the Opera Company of Boston. His name was Placido Domingo. The
story is that Caldwell got him for $250 a performance _ plus
baby-sitting fees.
</P>
<P>
   After the tenor's ``Messiah'' performance, Michael Steinberg
reported in the Globe, ``Domingo has a handsome voice and
apparently considerable musicianship and technique. He was,
however, riveted so closely to his score that it seemed as though
he were finding out about `Messiah' one eighth note at a time as it
went along.''
</P>
<P>
   Within three years of that ``Messiah,'' Domingo had begun a
glorious career at the Metropolitan Opera, where this year he
celebrated the 30th anniversary of his debut _ and three decades at
the top of his profession. Domingo has also developed an important
supplementary career as a conductor, and serves as artistic
director of two opera companies, in Washington, D.C., and Los
Angeles. Domingo has not sung often in Boston since ``Hippolyte et
Aricie'' in 1966, but his regular appearances on television have
served as some compensation. A recent Washington performance of
Canio in Leoncavallo's ``Pagliacci'' was taped for television.
</P>
<P>
   To publicize this event, Domingo sat still last week for an
early evening conference-call interview following a rehearsal for a
National Symphony Orchestra concert he was conducting.
</P>
<P>
   The great American tenor Richard Tucker recorded ``Pagliacci''
as a young man, but refused to sing it onstage until he was 50; he
thought the role was too dangerous for a young voice. Domingo, on
the other hand, has sung Leoncavallo's tragic clown throughout his
career _ and he's still going strong at 57.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sang my first `Pagliacci' in 1966,'' Domingo recalls. ``I
was 25 years old. It was a concert performance for the Metropolitan
Opera before my official debut in the house. I had just sung at the
City Opera in Ginastera's `Don Rodrigo,' and the Met asked me to
sing `Pagliacci' at the old Lewisohn Stadium. I sang both
`Cavalleria Rusticana' and `Pagliacci' at that concert. I sang my
first stage performances of `Pagliacci' in Pasadena in 1967 or
1969, as a substitute for somebody else. People said if I did it, I
wouldn't have any voice left, but in my artistic life I have always
taken risks, and the part of Canio has become one of my good-luck
tokens.''
</P>
<P>
   The danger of ``Pagliacci,'' Domingo says, ``is that the drama
is so big. If you are a singer with temperament and feeling you can
lose yourself in the drama; you have to have a good technique
because a verismo opera like this can kill your voice. They say it
takes more technique to sing Verdi and Donizetti, but I'm not sure
I agree. You can start `Vesti la giubba,' but maybe you won't
finish it! The secret is to do it only with your own voice.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1981 Domingo appeared in a ``Pagliacci'' production at La
Scala directed by Franco Zeffirelli that resulted in a movie, and
he has also sung in the Met's Zeffirelli production of the opera.
``The 1981 `Pagliacci' was exactly 10 years after my 40th birthday;
16 years later there are naturally many differences. I have done a
whole life singing the role of `Pagliacci.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The production that will be televised is a new Zeffirelli
production, set in in the present day. Domingo has not been
extensively associated with experimental time-travel productions,
but defends this one. `` `Pagliacci' is a believable story that
could happen at any time or in any place, not just Leoncavallo's
time, so there is no problem with updating it. . . . I have seen
updated productions of `Tosca' put into the time of the Gestapo,
but if you're still singing about Napoleon, it doesn't work. You
have to change a lot of things if you want to update `Tosca,' but
this is not the case in `Pagliacci.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Domingo has been a frequent collaborator with Zeffirelli. ``In
the films of `Pagliacci' and `Otello' there was time for him to
work with the singers in a very delicate way. In the opera house it
doesn't matter how much time you have, it isn't enough. . . . There
are always lots of little details in a Zeffirelli production, like
a little girl walking across the stage eating an apple. One of the
really great things is that this aspect works very well for
television _ in the theater it is almost impossible to see
everything that is going on in the theater, but on television you
can be more aware of the different details.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years Domingo has amassed what is probably the largest
repertory of any leading tenor in history. A few parts he would
like to sing have eluded him, however. ``There are a very few roles
still that I haven't done that I really want to. Tristan I think I
will only record. I think the part is a little too much; if I were
to try to sing that third act on the stage, I would really
legitimately spoil my voice. Right now I am preparing Tchaikovsky's
`Pique-Dame,' which I have in March at the Met. I will also sing
Beethoven's `Fidelio' on a recording. I have sung Siegmund in the
Wagner's `Ring,' and Loge, but I would also like to try both
Siegfrieds, in `Siegfried' and `Die Goetterdaemmerung,' on the
recording at least. Something I would really like to do on the
recording, which I did already on the stage, is sing Enee in
Berlioz's `Les Troyens.' If I am still singing by 2003 when is
coming the 200th birthday of Berlioz, I would love to do a
recording _ but it is a tremendous achievement to do a recording of
this opera.''
</P>
<P>
   (What a great project this would be for the world's finest
Berlioz orchestra, still the BSO, and its music director, who has
evolved into a major Berlioz conductor.)
</P>
<P>
   Asked what the future of Three Tenors Enterprises is, Domingo
responds, ``We are grateful _ this is a miracle that has been going
on for eight years. In January we will do a concert in Japan and
another one in South Africa in April, and some other ones are being
prepared, maybe three or four, before we arrive in 2002 at the
World Cup football again. Maybe we will just close there. A moment
will come when the public says, `This is enough.' Or perhaps we are
closer to the moment when we are going to say ourselves, `It's
enough.' But we enjoy tremendously doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the phone you can tell that Domingo smiles at the
recollection of his Handel &AMP; Haydn Society ``Messiah'' _ his
speaking voice is expressive and melodious too. ``I had not a clue
that this career was going to come to me. I just really enjoyed
what I was doing. I was very young, but I was also very
professional, and I can tell you I was very dedicated. But you
never really think about what is going to happen _ you just do
something expecting to be good. I never did expect to be one of the
biggest people in opera; that wasn't the reason I did anything. I
went from one place to another, full speed, and I am very happy and
satisfied that I am still singing. I am still dedicated, taking
this career with devotion and dedication.''

BABY STEPS

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ The story isn't new. Rock band records demo tape on
four-track machine in songwriter's messy living room and sends it
out to a hundred or so indie labels. Demo winds up in garbage heap
with the piles of other unsolicited demos received that week. Band
doesn't get a deal. Or, miracle of miracles, they do get signed,
and make a CD. Unfortunately, indie label lacks funds and clout
needed to get band's song on the radio. CD is purchased by band's
50 closest friends. End of story, either way.
</P>
<P>
   Or not. Every once in a while that CD gets noticed, not because
an executive had the deep pockets or the industry influence to
wedge a single into rotation, and not because it mimics the
lucrative tinkle of the platinum-selling band du jour, but rather
because the music
</P>
<P>
   _ and here's a radical notion _ is that good. Boston rock band
Baby Ray may be poised to join that rarified stratum of groups that
make their way into the mainstream, against all odds, on the sheer
strength of their songs.
</P>
<P>
   Together for just more than a year, Baby Ray released its first
CD, ``Monkey Puzzle,'' last month on the New York-based Thirsty Ear
label. The first single, ``Never Know My Name'' is being spun on
WBCN's and WFNX's Sunday night local music shows, and the band
performed live in 'BCN's studios last week. ``They were great,''
enthuses DJ Shred, who played the 7-inch single of the song
``Sorry,'' when it came out a year ago. ``They're really trying to
do something different.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, ``Never Know My Name'' skitters out of the speakers with
a pair of kinetic ping-ponging guitars and a thoroughly ingenious,
twisted melody. Drums bash in a tart, taut shuffle, and the bass
line ricochets in deep space like a rubber band with a brain. The
song, and the whole CD, bristles with an energy as oddball as it is
pristine, as challenging as it is accessible. This music is
unabashedly catchy, and yet you'd be hard-pressed to find a hook.
It's genuinely, seductively smart.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with 14 tracks and more chord changes than some rockers
can count, Baby Ray cuts a rakish path through the trippy fields of
quirk-pop mapped by XTC, the band to which they're often likened.
It's an apt comparison, but by no means does justice to the range
of Baby Ray's sound, which stretches from dreamy balladry (the
mesmerizing ``Curl'') to heavy metal (sprawling, wordless ``Porky's
Prey'').
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not genre-crossing at all,'' explains
singer/guitarist/songwriter Erich Groat _ who wrote the songs on
``Monkey Puzzle'' and also plays in the local band Willard Grant
Conspiracy _ over lunch at the Middle East. ``There's a lot more
slow acoustic stuff, and some extremely frightening, angry,
metallic stuff. We wanted to suggest some of the variety of what we
do, but also wanted to put together a cohesive record. So we
decided basically to make this a pop album.''
</P>
<P>
   The four-song, four-track demo that paved the way was recorded,
in rock 'n' roll-storybook fashion, in Groat's living room, with
fellow Baby Ray singer-guitarist Ken Lafler. The pair _ who met at
Williams College, moved to Boston, and have since played in various
bands together _ decided to lay down their own tracks after their
most recent group, Brain Helicopter, broke up. Drummer Nathan Logus
(who's played with the Barnies and Jules Verdone, and the only band
member who couldn't make it to the interview) played on a couple of
the songs, and, lacking a bass player, everyone took a turn at
bringing up the bottom end. ``It occurred to us,'' says Lafler,
``that if we were really gonna sign, we'd need to have an actual
band.'' Enter bassist Paul Simonoff (formerly of Chainsuck), who
was found, quite literally, milling about at T.T. the Bear's Place
in Cambridge. ``I was watching a show and Nate was basically
tapping people on the shoulder asking them if they played bass,''
Simonoff explains. ``He gave me the tape and I auditioned.'' That
was August, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, Baby Ray signed with Thirsty Ear, a small label,
but one with an illustrious history. Before it became a
freestanding record label in 1995, Thirsty Ear Communications
handled marketing for various major labels. In the late 1970s, the
company pioneered the concept of selling artists to the
then-unnamed alternative music audience; Talking Heads, R.E.M., and
the Police were some of the artists Thirsty Ear worked with early
on. The company's founder and president, Peter Gordon _ who signed
Baby Ray _ says he hears in them the elusive blend of
adventurousness and artistry that bears the mark of a great band.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demo was just very fresh, very musical,'' says Gordon.
``It was intriguing because the band took a lot of chances and yet
they really understood the art of making music. Some bands just
deconstruct, and that's fine. But Baby Ray are able to take off,
and leave just enough bread crumbs to find their way back home.
It's a guitar-based pop band, and every trick in that genre has
been pulled. That Baby Ray were able to reinvent that, I think, is
tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirsty Ear's enthusiasm and support is the bottom line for Baby
Ray. As to pesky details like paying the rent, Groat moonlights as
a linguistics professor at Harvard, Lafler works in the financial
aid office at the Harvard Law School, Simonoff tests software, and
Logus is a freelance Web page designer. ``To me, the big advantage
of being with Thirsty Ear is that we knew they wouldn't mess with
us, creatively.'' says Lafler. ``We knew that they would let us
make the album we wanted to make. And I think for all of us that
was the most important thing to begin with.'' The disadvantages,
Lafler concurs, revolve around more practical concerns, ``like they
can't get us on commercial radio, and maybe they can't even get us
on college radio.'' (The single has, in fact, been picked up by a
handful of stations around the country, and has made it to the Top
30 in Cooksville, Tenn.) ``But it's a balance,'' adds Groat, ``of
doing a creative thing and still having something we can move ahead
with career-wise.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet in spite of this project's relatively low status in the
pecking order of the music industry, the music itself is being
heard loud and clear. ``Boston is a hotbed, but every once in a
while a band stands out, has its own sound, that separates it from
the pack,'' says Sean Sweeney, vice-president for marketing at
Newbury Comics, where ``Monkey Puzzle'' is being given every
advantage. ``We're trying to help the band out by keeping the CD
well-priced and positioned on an endcap (an aisle-end display).
That's what we do with the records we believe in. And it's selling
nicely.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, ascending the ladder of rock stardom is an exceedingly
slow, often mysterious, and entirely unpredictable process. For all
the positive media response, including notices in Billboard and
Musician magazines, Baby Ray is having trouble lining up club shows
at home. They've played sporadically at Mama Kin, Bill's Bar, and
the Lizard Lounge, but can't seem to break into a regular schedule
on Boston's tightly knit club circuit. ``We're not a guaranteed
draw,'' Lafler concedes. ``Many people who book the clubs still
haven't made up their minds.'' Thirsty Ear's Gordon, cautiously
optimistic, says that concentrating on breaking Baby Ray in the
Boston area is a double-edged sword. ``On the one hand, Boston's
been greatly supportive. On the other hand it's a helluva music
town, saturated with talent. It's a high cost of entry getting into
Boston. But I think Baby Ray finally has all the calling cards.''
</P>
<P>
   The boys in the band, meanwhile, are staying sane and grounded,
learning to live in the protracted state of uncertainty _ full of
wild highs and inexplicable lows and endlessly tangled signals _
that is a hallmark of an aspiring musician's life. They're hanging
on to their day jobs as long as they can, because ``you really
can't predict when it's going to reach a certain point and take
off,'' says Groat. ``We're not pulling the levers,'' Lafler adds.
``And all our potential hit songs have the F-word in them, so I'm
not sure what's going to happen,'' Groat cracks, only half-joking.
</P>
<P>
   These are baby steps for Baby Ray. They know they've made a
great record; they also realize that that's no guarantee they'll be
embraced by an adoring public, or even, for that matter, that
they'll get a hometown gig. It's a time for big hopes and realistic
expectations. Asked to define success, Lafler mentions taking an
entire year to devote exclusively to music. Groat fantasizes about
an enthusiastic audience. And Simonoff says, without a glimmer of
irony, ``more microphones would be good.''

PG&AMP;E VOWS TO PAY FOR OUTAGE FROM PROFITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SETH ROSENFELD  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ An apologetic Pacific Gas and Electric Co.
promised not to sock customers with the cost of claims stemming
from Tuesday's regional blackout, saying its stockholders would pay
up to $10 million in claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just not going to ask customers to pay for this event,''
PG&AMP;E spokesman Chris Johnson said Thursday. Instead, claims will be
charged against profits, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But a consumer group said that, in the past, customers have had
trouble getting PG&AMP;E to pay claims, and questioned whether the
utility's proposed $822 million rate increase now before the state
Public Utilities Commission might leave customers more exposed to
the cost of claims arising from future power failures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern is that PG&AMP;E should not be collecting more so
ratepayers are paying for something like this,'' said Mindy Spatt,
spokeswoman for The Utility Reform Network, a utility watchdog
group in San Francisco. ``We want to make sure that ratepayers
aren't ultimately paying for those damages.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was emphatic that costs due to blackout claims would not
be passed to customers in the form of a rate increase. The request
for a rate increase came well before the outage.
</P>
<P>
   The blackout lasted more than six hours and left more than 1
million people powerless in San Francisco and northern San Mateo
County.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E officials have said it was caused when employees at a San
Mateo substation failed to disconnect a ground wire after
maintenance work. The power company, which is a subsidiary of the
PG&AMP;E Corp., also said the employees did not follow standard work
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   The episode threatens to present the nation's second largest
utility with its greatest surge of damage claims in nearly a
decade. PG&AMP;E said Thursday it already had sent more than 3,000
claim forms to customers.
</P>
<P>
   Severe winter storms of 1995 generated about 6,000 claims, while
downed power grids in 1996 knocked out electricity throughout the
West Coast and sparked 1,800 claims, Johnson said. In contrast, the
typical storm season brings 300 claims, he added.
</P>
<P>
   As private parties prepared claims, San Francisco officials on
Thursday continued to ring up damages due to fewer transit fares
and parking tickets, employee overtime costs, lost interest on more
than $40 million in property tax checks the city could not deposit,
and bank charges for bounced drafts.
</P>
<P>
   The city attorney is expected to prepare a preliminary tally
within 90 days, said Ron Vinson, a spokesman for Mayor Willie
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   While PG&AMP;E was conciliatory, it was legally unclear whether the
utility could be held to pay some disputed claims. For while it
conceded error in the debacle, it stopped far short of admitting it
had been negligent.
</P>
<P>
   Under PUC rules, PG&AMP;E ``will not be liable for interruption'' of
electrical service unless it arises from its ``failure to exercise
reasonable diligence.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Schulte, director of the PUC's Consumer Services Division,
said the question of negligence was one that the PUC would look at
``very closely'' as it investigates the cause of the failure.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said payments for damages would not come from the
utility's operating budget. Instead, the costs will be charged as
an expense against profits, he said.

A SOAP OPERA FOR NEW YORK FRINGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
SOMEWHERE IN THE CITY 
Written by: Ramin(cq) Niami and Patrick Dillon 
Directed by: Ramin Niami 
Starring: Sandra Bernhard, Bai Ling, Ornella Muti, Robert John
Burke, Peter Stormare, Paul Anthony Stewart 
Running time: 93 minutes 
Unrated 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amid New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani's mad quest to turn Manhattan
into a strip shopping mall, the Lower East Side remains a precious
outpost of seedy fabulousness. It hasn't been Starbucked or
Disney-fied; it isn't jammed with Midwestern tourists with
runny-nosed kids looking for Planet Hollywood T-shirts. It
stubbornly remains the rough among ol' Rudy's cookie-cutter,
franchise diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   More life can happen on the fire escape of a Lower East Side
tenement than in entire neighborhoods, and that's probably why
Ramin Niami has set his film, ``Somewhere in the City'' within one
of those noisy, paint-peeling, vaguely dangerous monuments to New
York's not-so-good life.
</P>
<P>
   This is ``Melrose Place'' for the less-than-beautiful crowd, six
people in an ever-futile search for love, success, and just a
dollop of happiness. Sandra Bernhard's moody, urgent rendition of
Sammy Cahn's ``Until the Real Thing Comes Along'' opens the film,
and the song is accented by screams, arguments, and loud sex _ the
bodacious buzz of the downtown brownstone.
</P>
<P>
   Bernhard's Betty is finishing a rather vocal session with a
one-night stand, Henry (John Fugelsang), who wants nothing more
than to get dressed and go. But Betty, a self-involved therapist
who spends clients' sessions talking about her own problems, wants
more. She wants to talk about what happened, and what this all
means. ``I don't want commitment,'' Henry says, zipping up his
pants, ``I just want my briefcase.'' Betty is wounded but
resilient. ``If you want to apologize,'' she says, handing him a
piece of paper, ``here's my number.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, her encounter is far better than that of Marta (Ornella
Muti), who has yawn-inducing sex with the building's fat, sleazy
super, who slips her $10 and gives her a break on the rent. Marta
hopes for a life with Frankie (Robert John Burke), a would-be crook
who would do well to find another line of work. The gang he
assembles to pull a dream heist at a jewelry store is so inept, the
getaway driver demands a different job because he can't drive a
stick shift.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Graham (Peter Stormare), a struggling actor hoping
to get his big break in a screen adaptation of the old TV sitcom
``I Dream of Jeannie,'' with Madonna as Jeannie and Keanu Reeves as
Major Tony Nelson. In the meantime, he's getting the occasional
commercial and teaching woefully untalented students.
</P>
<P>
   Slightly above the fray _ or below it, depending on your
perspective _ is Che (Paul Anthony Stewart), and what would the
Lower East Side be without some noodge shouting dusty Marxist
slogans into a microphone in Union Square? Che may love talkin'
about revolution, but he's actually a rich kid embarrassed by his
Park Avenue parents. The only innocent in the lot is Lu Lu (Bai
Ling), a Chinese student looking for someone to marry so she can
get a green card.
</P>
<P>
   Since it's driven by character, not plot, the film is a bit
disjointed. And in juggling so many characters, some get dropped
for so long you have to jog your memory to recall who they are and
what their story is. But Niami treats his subjects with respect and
has a genuine affection for them.
</P>
<P>
   The cast is solid, and this is Bernhard's best role since she
shook up the world in her 1983 debut, in Martin Scorsese's ``The
King of Comedy.'' It's appropriate that the role finds her in
familiar cinematic territory _ fringe New York, where the apple may
be bruised but is still juicy and sweet at the core.

LETTERS TO CLEO LOOKS BACK TO AN OLDER `SISTER' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Letters to Cleo have been a legitimate Boston success story in
the '90s. The band achieved a nationwide hit with the irresistibly
poppy ``Here and Now'' from the ``Melrose Place'' soundtrack. That
was followed by global touring and, more recently, performances on
the Lilith Fair.
</P>
<P>
   Letters to Cleo are presently on a short break, but they've
taken that opportunity to create a special bonus for fans. It's the
remastered CD release of their original cassette of songs written
in 1988 and '89, back when singer Kay Hanley was still in her
teens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only sold the cassette at shows _ and we only printed about
2,000 copies,'' Hanley says of ``Sister,'' which just came out on
Wicked Disc, the record label run by Newbury Comics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not doing any advertising for this. It's a very
grass-roots thing,'' says Hanley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a neat way to keep things active between our other
records,'' adds Hanley, reached this week during a vacation in
Hawaii, where her husband, Mike Eisenstein (guitarist for Letters),
is doing studio work for Nina Gordon, formerly with the now-defunct
Veruca Salt.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Sister'' CD is surprisingly good _ a heady dose of
incipient alterna-rock, crowned by the girl-pop attitude of Hanley.
Songs such as ``I See,'' ``He's Stayin','' and ``Pete Beat,'' all
recorded at Fort Apache studios, hold up well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is what it is,'' Hanley says of the CD. ``The sound of my
voice (then) makes me cringe when I listen today, but I've always
been hard on myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Letters opted to release the CD after learning through the
Internet that some fans were planning to make CD copies of the
cassette to sell to other Letters lovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the tapes they'd be copying are from third- and
fourth-generation dubs of the original cassette,'' says Hanley.
``So we decided this would be a good time to remaster it and put it
out ourselves.'' (The CD is available through Newbury Comics and
the band's Web page at www.letterstocleo.com.)
</P>
<P>
   The full-length CD is spiced with a few other tracks from the
archives. The raucous ``You Dirty Rat'' (a Scruffy the Cat tune
featuring onetime Scruffy singer Charlie Chesterman on backup
vocals), was on the ``Safe and Sound'' compilation, and ``Last of
the Secret Agents,'' a B-side that appeared only in Britain, is a
Nancy Sinatra tune given a particularly hard-rocking workout by
Hanley.
</P>
<P>
   For icing, there's also a Letters version of Fleetwood Mac's
``Dreams'' (given a surprisingly faithful reading by Hanley), which
the band originally put on a Rock for Choice compilation album.
</P>
<P>
   As for the future, Hanley and her cohorts expect to reconvene
early next year to write and record songs for a new album.
``Hopefully, we'll be ready to get back into the studio this
spring,'' says Hanley.

IRISH LIES, AND SMILING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
WAKING NED DEVINE 
Written and directed by: Kirk Jones 
Starring: Ian Bannen, David Kelly, Fionnula Flanagan, Susan Lynch,
James Nesbitt, Maura O'Malley, Eileen Dromey, Brendan F. Dempsey 
Running time: 93 minutes 
Rated: PG (nudity, language and thematic elements) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Waking Ned Devine'' is a charmingly rambunctious village
comedy about a couple of geezers trying to float a lottery scam in
a tiny Irish coastal town. Ian Bannen's Jackie and David Kelly's
Michael, waiting a lifetime for their big score, learn, after much
surreptitious research, that the big winning national lottery
ticket was sold to Ned Devine, a bachelor fisherman. When they pay
him a visit to try to separate him from the ticket, they find him
in bed, dead of natural causes, as it dawns on us that the title
refers to mourning Ned, not bringing him out of a deep sleep.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme escalates. Why not pose as Ned, smiling Jackie asks
nervous Michael, when the national lottery man arrives from Dublin,
and split the huge jackpot? But what's proposed in the quiet of a
dark pub changes in the light of day. Jackie's smile turns ever
more serpentine and rubbery as the complications pile up alongside
the dire predictions of Jackie's wife that they'll all end up in
jail. Given that, and the fact that this is one of those village
comedies where everybody knows everybody else's business, it isn't
long before the whole town is in on the scam _ and the payoff, if
they can bring it off and divert the lottery official with lies and
local color.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the film's charm stems from writer-director Kirk Jones's
ability to convince us of everybody's essential innocence. Fionnula
Flanagan, as Jackie's wife, reminds him with a mix of terror and
common sense that Michael, the villager elected to pass himself off
as Ned, has never told a lie in his life. Bannen's Jackie, face
suffused by duplicitous good will, suggests Jack Lemmon's offshore
brother, a nice guy whose head has been turned by the self-deluding
thought that he's a criminal mastermind.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, comically frail, floating through the action like a
breath, suggests a leprechaun who has concluded a long run in a
Samuel Beckett revival. Eyes greedy with excitement and terror,
bulging out of his eggshell skull, he provides just the right note
of precariousness needed to put the brakes on Jackie's tendency to
confuse wishful thinking with reality. They're a disarmingly
orchestrated pair. It's because they're amateurs, and you know they
won't make a habit of swindling the national lottery, that you
can't resist throwing in with Jackie and Michael and hoping they'll
beat the odds _ and their own amateurish ineptness _ and somehow
pull it off.
</P>
<P>
   The locals all are inscribed with total, effortless rightness
that never stumbles into cuteness or quaintness. The setting _ the
Isle of Man in the Irish Sea _ adds a definite magic, too. As if
knowing the very atmosphere is on their side, the actors ride the
communal spirit, from Susan Lynch and James Nesbitt, whose love is
impeded because he can't shake the smell of pig farming, to Eileen
Dromey's contrary old witch, who convinces you she'd take more
pleasure making everybody else miserable than pocketing her share
of the pot. If there's the merest hint of larceny in your heart,
you'll find the delightfully lively and irrepressible ``Waking Ned
Devine'' hot-wired to it. It's one of blarney's greatest hits.

   UNDATED The simplest of plans can turn into the biggest messes
once human imperfection is factored into the equation. That's the
idea behind the crime drama ``A Simple Plan _'' and the reason the
movie isn't as good as it should have been.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins in one of those wintry Western towns, where
three guys stumble on a small plane that crashed. Inside that plane
is a bag containing nearly $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The men quickly decide to keep the money. Sounds simple enough.
But for these three ordinary guys, the criminal life is more than
they can manage.
</P>
<P>
   Hank (Bill Paxton) is struggling to make ends meet down at the
feed store as he and his wife (Bridget Fonda) await their first
child.
</P>
<P>
   Hank's brother (Billy Bob Thornton) is a semi-idiot, and their
friend (Brent Briscoe) is even farther down the brain scale but
higher on the danger quotient.
</P>
<P>
   As the men wait to find out if anyone's looking for the money
before they split it, they start to crack under the pressure. Each
small slip leads them deeper into a web of coverup and murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Simple Plan'' shares a premise with the nasty comedy ``Very
Bad Things'': Take ordinary people, throw them into criminal
situations they can't handle, and watch them make messes they can't
clean up.
</P>
<P>
   But ``A Simple Plan'' is a grimly serious film, without ``Very
Bad ``Things' '' dark, demented humor to liven the wait for the
plot to develop. Also without the tense pacing and clever
direction.
</P>
<P>
   Director San Raimi (``The Quick and the Dead'') tells the story
in a straightforward way, which is the movie's strength.
</P>
<P>
   But Raimi doesn't develop the characters into people we either
like or hate. There's no one to cheer for or against in this tale
of how two wrongs don't make a right and neither do 20.
</P>
<P>
   The story itself is believable and the men go through credible
tensions. But the movie doesn't pull you into their plight.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton overdoes the idiot routines with his duct-taped glasses
and writhing face. His performance here only serves to remind you
of how much better he did with a similar character in ``Sling
Blade.''
</P>
<P>
   Paxton (``Twister'') telegraphs every move, so there's no
suspense when he's on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Fonda (``Jackie Brown'') and Briscoe (``Sling Blade'') create
the most interesting characters, but they don't get enough screen
time.
</P>
<P>
   We probably all wonder what we'd do if we stumbled onto that
mythical bag of money. This movie serves as a primer of what not to
do.
</P>
<P>
   But ``A Simple Plan'' might have been more interesting if these
guys weren't such losers and you felt they had a shot at getting
away with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Simple Plan'' is rated R for profanity, violence and nudity.
2 stars. &QL;

FAITHFUL MARK FEAST DAY OF OUR LADY OF QUADALUPE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Our Lady of Guadalupe's image as a prayerful
Madonna framed by golden rays adorns the interiors of large and
small churches around the world. The famous icon also dangles from
rearview mirrors and is emblazoned on T-shirts of gang members.
</P>
<P>
   It also has a special place in Arturo Loredo's restaurant on
Fort Worth's north side.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is my consoler, my protector _ the protector of all
Mexican people,'' said Loredo, referring to an image of Guadalupe
that hangs prominently in his restaurant. A candle glows beneath
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I light a candle every day for the Virgin,'' said Loredo, who
is among millions of Roman Catholics who will celebrate the Feast
of Our Lady of Guadalupe on Saturday. The feast day of the
patroness of Mexico and the Americas is observed in all dioceses of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The festival recalls Dec. 12, 1531, when the Virgin Mary is said
to have appeared to an Indian peasant, Juan Diego, on Tepeyak hill
outside Mexico City. She ordered him to build a temple in her
honor.
</P>
<P>
   When the local bishop did not believe the apparitions, Juan
Diego was ordered by the Virgin to gather roses, blooming out of
season, on the barren hilltop. He returned to the bishop and when
he opened his cloak, the roses fell to the floor and the colorful
image of the Virgin of Guadalupe had been printed on the garment.
</P>
<P>
   The temple was built. And the faithful believe that the same
image _ which has not faded in more than 450 years _ remains in the
Basilica of Guadalupe outside Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Stafford Poole of Los Angeles, a Catholic priest,
researcher and author of ``Our Lady of Guadalupe: the Origins and
Sources of a Mexican National Symbol, 1531-1797,'' said the church
has taken no official position on the image's origin.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the pope talks about the image, he's not saying people
have to believe the miracle, although many do believe,'' Poole
said. ``Catholics are free to reject the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are legions of believers. More than 1 million people a
month visit the basilica, many crawling to the church on bloody
knees to ask for healing and other favors of the Virgin. Poole said
gang members wear the image on T-shirts for protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``One merchant in east Los Angeles got tired of having graffiti
on his walls,'' said Poole. ``He placed an image of Our Lady of
Guadalupe there, and hasn't had any trouble since.''
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II will make his own pilgrimage to the Guadalupe
shrine during a visit to Mexico in January and many believe that
may be another step toward canonizing Juan Diego as a saint.
</P>
<P>
   Debates about Mexico's most important icon have been carried on
for centuries by anthropologists, historians, theologians and other
scholars.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Monsignor Guillermo Schulenburg, the abbot of the
Guadalupe basilica, created a furor in Mexico when quotes
attributed to him by a Catholic journal seemed to question the
miraculous origin of the image. Although the 80-year-old priest
said he was misquoted, he stepped down from his basilica position.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no debate among the faithful.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is our mother, who comes to us in our hour of need,'' said
Juanita Gonzalez, a member of Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church
in Fort Worth. She admired an impressive painting of the Guadalupe
Virgin that hangs above her church's altar. It was copied from the
original and bought in Mexico three years ago. She knows there are
skeptics, but she is not bothered.
</P>
<P>
   ``My faith is the same,'' said Gonzalez, who keeps an image of
Guadalupe in her home. ``I know there have been a lot of studies
that cast doubts.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Claudio Zudaire, pastor of Our Lady of Guadalupe, said
most of his 1,000 parishioners believe in the miraculous origin of
the image.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the most important thing, though,'' he said. ``The
important point is that after she appeared, the Catholic faith
spread out all over America. During the decade following the
Spanish invasion, very few had converted. After the Virgin
appeared, the conversion was very fast. To me, that is the real
miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   For a minority, the image is negative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guadalupe is a symbol of Spanish oppression _ of cultural
rape,'' said Ome Akatl ``Kurly'' Tlapoyahua, the Fort Worth leader
of the Mexica Eagle Society, a national group attempting to reclaim
the pre-conquest language, philosophies and spiritual practices of
Mexico's indigenous Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Juan Diego, he said, is a hoax perpetrated by the
Spanish to negate the indigenous religions of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Tlapoyahua contends that Mexico's Guadalupe was derived from the
Spanish Virgin of Guadalupe in Extremadura, Spain, a mountainous
province where Hernan Cortes and other conquistadors lived before
invading Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   He says the Catholic Virgin was a substitute for Tonantzin, an
earth mother figure destroyed by the Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Zudaire, a native of Spain, disputes the view that the Virgin of
Guadalupe is a symbol of oppression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Lady didn't appear to the bishop; she appeared to an
Indian, a poor Indian,'' Zudaire said. ``So this is not something
that comes from Spain. It is something that belongs to the country
of Mexico. It is a triumph of Indian people, not a conquest by
Spain.''

UNINSPIRED `FROST' TURNS TO COMIC SLUSH 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Why'd they turn Dad into a snowman in ``Jack Frost''?
So the kid could utter the unforgettable line, ``Dad, you're
melting!''
</P>
<P>
   But one goofy line does not make a comedy, and ``Jack Frost''
does not make it into the small collection of Christmas movies you
would feel happy to put under your tree.
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong with ``Jack Frost''? No story, not enough humor, a
silly setup, and a guy in the snowman suit who looks like he didn't
make the first cut at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Keaton stars as Jack Frost, an aging rock-and-roller who
is almost making it as a golden oldie even though he was never a
star.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow Jack has also managed to maintain a normal, middle-class
life with his wife (Kelly Preston) and 11-year-old son Charlie
(Joseph Cross).
</P>
<P>
   Is Jack a bad father? Not compared with every other dad in the
kids-on-the-side world of rock and roll.
</P>
<P>
   He obviously loves his son but, for some reason, hasn't taught
him his secret hockey shot, which would turn Charlie from a loser
into a winner and help him beat the snow bullies in their small
Colorado town.
</P>
<P>
   When Jack dies _ expectedly _ before he can pass along his
hockey wisdom, he magically comes back the next Christmas season as
the snowman in the front yard.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that probably is a sign that Hollywood has exhausted all of
its ideas for Christmas movies. So if you have a follow-up to
``dead dad becomes a snowman,'' rush it to the movie studio of your
choice right away.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Charlie is the only one who knows that the snowman is
really Dad, which could lead to some fun but doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   A few amusing moments just aren't enough to drag this load into
laughland.
</P>
<P>
   Keaton has come a long way from the comic heights of ``Night
Shift,'' ``Mr. Mom'' and ``Beetlejuice'' _ and it's been downhill,
through ``The Paper'' and ``Speechless'' to ``Jack Frost.'' He can
still deliver the jokes, but the ``Frosty'' scriptwriters leave him
holding an empty bag.
</P>
<P>
   TV director Troy Miller, making his first movie, misses the most
promising moment: What happens when Mom realizes that her
ex-husband has turned from a flake into a snowflake?
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack Frost'' may work for people with an excess of
sentimentality and for young kids who don't get restless easily.
Everyone else would have more fun making their own snowman and
saying, ``Dad, you're melting.''
</P>
<P>
   Rated PG, ``Jack Frost'' contains a couple of sexual references
and some light profanity. 2 stars. &QL;

TEXAS EXPORTS PARED BY ASIAN FIZZLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL BOWEN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas export growth for the first nine months of this year
slowed to one-third of its 1997 rate as the Asian economic crisis
sapped its double-digit power of recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Total exports are up 5.1 percent for the first nine months of
1998, to $64.71 billion, a $3.12 billion increase.
</P>
<P>
   That compares with a growth rate of 13.9 percent for all of 1997
and reflects weaknesses in the Asian and South American markets,
according to the Texas Department of Economic Development.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to question anymore whether the economic
problems in Asia are having an affect on our exports,'' said
Branner Stewart, an analyst for the department.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico, however, continued to dominate the state's overall
export picture with solid growth. Exports to Mexico hit $26.65
billion for the first nine months of 1998, up 18.7 percent over the
same period last year and amounting to 41 percent of all Texas
exports.
</P>
<P>
   ``That reflects the stabilization of the Mexican economy and
shows how important that market is for Texas,'' said Bernard
Weinstein, director of the University of North Texas Center for
Economic Development.
</P>
<P>
   Exports to Canada, the United States' other North American Free
Trade Agreement partner, were up 9.7 percent over the first three
quarters of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news lies in Asia, where Texas exports had grown 80
percent between 1992 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But so far this year, exports to China and South Korea are off
40 percent. Exports to Japan dropped 18.7 percent, to $1.9 billion,
and Taiwan is down 9.2 percent, to $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   South America, historically another land of export promise, is
showing weakness, too. Exports to Brazil were flat and Venezuela
saw a 5.9 percent drop to $1.26 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The weakening of export growth has shown up in large and small
ways.
</P>
<P>
   Layoffs in the computer and semiconductor industries, and more
recently in the aviation industry, have been blamed on the slack in
Asian orders.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling Electronics distribution center in Grapevine has cut
the number of warehouse employees from 170 to 134 in the past six
months.
</P>
<P>
   A lack of sales growth for the company's electrical connectors
have meant that it has had to do the same work with fewer people,
said Ed Kelly, Sterling's warehouse manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is just flat,'' Kelly said. ``We can't help but be
affected.''
</P>
<P>
   Demand for telephone systems and computer technology in
developing nations pushed export sales of electronic equipment and
components to $14.74 billion for the first nine months, up 6.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that produce auto parts and other transportation
equipment saw export sales jump 36 percent over last year, to $6.62
billion, much of it bound for Mexico and other parts of Latin
America where automakers have built assembly plants.
</P>
<P>
   Petroleum, chemicals and agricultural producers saw declines
because Asian countries have developed their own sources for those
commodities. China, in particular, has developed its own cotton
farms.
</P>
<P>
   The good news lies in early indications that the economies of
Thailand, where the Asian crisis started, and South Korea are
improving, Weinstein said.

GREEN BAY'S INJURY LIST IS LONGER THAN 49ERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY RATTO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Ever had the itch to shake down a little chaos,
to make people pull their own heads off in madness? To yell,
``Fire!'' in a crowded showing of ``Rugrats,'' or ``Impeachment
hearings!'' to an ordinary citizen?
</P>
<P>
   No, there's nothing quite like good-natured malicious mischief
to speed you on your way into the holiday season. So if you'll
please be in good order, clear your throat and prepare to run like
a rabbit to avoid the ensuing stampede when you say: ``The Green
Bay Packers!''
</P>
<P>
   Have you seen the Packers lately? In fact, you haven't. Nobody
has. Their weekly injury report is like watching Bryant Young of
the San Francisco 49ers break his leg 15 times in succession. And
that's not an exaggeration. This week's Packers' injured list
includes a broken collarbone, a torn hamstring, a broken ankle, a
broken jaw, four knees, three shoulders and ... well, 17 players
are on blocks, 13 questionable, doubtful or just plain out.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike the Denver Broncos, who are feuding with the injury
report rule by putting anyone on who looks like he might have been
injured at some time, these are the real deal.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, you half expect to see listings like ``Brett Favre:
Couldn't be better, the picture of health, brown as a nut and ready
for love ... but give it time _ questionable'' or ``Mike Holmgren:
Superb reputation, slightly overamped ambition, will probably get
taken out on a sideline tackle against the Bears _ doubtful,
pending.''
</P>
<P>
   All this, when juxtaposed against the fact the Packers still
play Chicago twice, means (a) Green Bay will still make the
playoffs, (b) they will almost certainly end up playing the 49ers
here on the first weekend of the playoffs, and (c) a lot of them
will be only vaguely aware that the 49ers can't beat the Packers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet given the injuries the Packers have endured this season
(they've gone through four tailbacks, and have lost so many wide
receivers they had to pick up Horace Copeland, who couldn't even
make a dent with the Eagles, just to field a full depth chart),
they seem closer these days to the Arizona Cardinals and New
Orleans Saints than to the 49ers or the Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   This naturally matters to 49ers fans because, unless the Atlanta
Falcons slip against New Orleans, Detroit or Miami (or draw referee
Phil Luckett's crew for any of those games), the Packers will be
San Francisco's opening-round playoff opponent _ a team barely
limping to the line against a team that could have the best record
of any wild-card team in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, we are left with one of those great philosophical
questions, the kind that rarely get answered to anyone's
satisfaction, namely: Would you rather have history on your side,
or health?
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers could end up the most maligned 13-3 team ever, at
least by those closest to it _ their cornerbacks aren't good, their
interior defense is shot now that Young is gone, Jerry Rice is
slowing up, nobody can find the fullback, they don't win by enough,
they're lousy against the spread, the team's getting old, the front
office is trapped on the space station Mir and
blah-de-blah-de-blah. Some of these things are in fact true.
</P>
<P>
   But they could have those 13 wins going into the postseason
without benefit of the first-round bye and, in that case, it is
nearly a certainty they will host a Green Bay team that has beaten
them five consecutive times in Holmgren-Favre years, the Green Bay
that has dominated both lines of scrimmage, the Green Bay that has
benefited from only one bad officials' call in that time.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Bay that doesn't know who is lining up for it at any
given time, but knows it can beat San Francisco with one ligament
tied behind its back.
</P>
<P>
   Weird, isn't it? And fun, too. A single elimination angst-off
between former Super Bowl winners facing equally uncertain futures.
It beats the rest of the first weekend's playoff schedule, be it
Jets-Bills, Patriots-Dolphins, Patriots-Bills, Jets-Dolphins,
Jets-Patriots, Bills-Dolphins, Cowboys-Saints, Cowboys-Cardinals,
Cowboys-Bucs, Cowboys-Giants or Cowboys-Lions.
</P>
<P>
   Especially Cowboys-Lions, now that we think about it.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, you may now rest a bit easier when you hear those three
dreaded words _ Green, Bay and Packers. There are things far more
worthy of your fear and loathing, like, ``Hey, Barney Frank and Bob
Barr are stripped to the waist and debating impeachment on TV,'' or
even worse, ``Honey, it's Saturday. Let's go to Toys R Us and do
all the kids' shopping.''

TURN AROUND DILBERT SYNDROME BY TAKING RESPONSIBILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is Dilbert dangerous?
</P>
<P>
   The misadventures of Dilbert and his comic strip colleagues have
kept legions of fans chuckling over their morning coffee. But some
believe the joke is on us.
</P>
<P>
   Dilbert doesn't just point out the problems that are endemic in
today's workplace. He is part of the problem, said Paul Bauck, a
Seattle-based author and management consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Bauck, who admits he is nevertheless a Dilbert fan himself, said
there is such a thing as the ``Dilbert Syndrome,'' which leads to
cynicism, lower productivity and the torpedoing of good intentions
at work.
</P>
<P>
   The hallmark of the Dilbert Syndrome is pessimism, he said.
``The first thought about any situation is negative.''
</P>
<P>
   Other characteristics of the Dilbert Syndrome include habitual,
biased thinking, a closed mind, and lack of desire to explore
situations or problems, Bauck said.
</P>
<P>
   Employees who suffer from the Dilbert Syndrome don't understand
how their work fits into the overall work of the company, or what
their own value is. They demonstrate an unwillingness to discover
how things work, or figure out what they could do to make the
company better, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Take a general lack of trust, and resistance to growth on the
job, add an unwillingness to volunteer or accept criticism, and you
have someone with full-blown Dilbert Syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Bauck, who wrote and self-published ``Stand Out in the Crowd;
Inspire Your Boss to Be Loyal to You'' (Bauck &AMP; Assoc., 1998,
$14.95), said the reason Dilbert is so popular is that it taps
people's cynicism about work and their belief that nothing changes.
</P>
<P>
   While a good laugh may offer short-term relief, it doesn't fix
the underlying problems, and instead reinforces them.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the characters in Dilbert refuse to listen to each other
or be open to suggestions and new ideas,'' he said. But survival in
business requires being able to adapt to a rapidly changing
environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``A spirit of inquiry or discovery creates the ability to grow
and learn in a changing business environment,'' he said. ``The
Dilbert characters display a resolution to maintain the status quo,
not learn new things and not inquire about what others think.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people steadfastly believe it's not in their best interest
to ask questions at work, he said. But that's a dangerous
assumption. Asking questions is the only way to find better ways to
get things done.
</P>
<P>
   Bauck draws his observations from working both sides of the
corporate fence. As a career counselor, he's listened to people's
frustrations with their jobs. As a management consultant, he's
listened to the frustrations of employers trying to get the best
out of their employees.
</P>
<P>
   When he asked employers and employees what they wanted from each
other, both sides told him the same things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides wanted the other party to be open-minded, willing
to learn, and to contribute new ideas,''
</P>
<P>
   he said.
</P>
<P>
   The key to combatting the Dilbert Syndrome at work is for both
sides to take responsibility for change, he said.
</P>
<P>
   All employees needs to invest time and energy figuring out their
contribution to the corporate bottom line and how what they do
affects the final customer.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals have the responsibility to ask questions, he said.
``It increases your value to the company if you know how the pieces
fit together.''
</P>
<P>
   The person who works in the employee cafeteria is still linked
to the success of the organization, he said. ``No matter how
tangential the link, it's there.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, employers bear the responsibility of
recognizing the ideas and contributions of their workers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Companies should build in ways to give that feedback, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And both sides should combat negative thinking.
</P>
<P>
   The knee-jerk reaction to any new idea is often to say, ``That
will never work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the response should be: ``How could we make this
work?''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the short term, Dilbert helps you make it through the
day,'' he said. But humor used to avoid problems only makes them
worse.
</P>
<P>
   All those Dilbert cartoons posted on bulletin boards are a good
thing if they remind people what they could be doing better.
They're destructive if they reinforce the notion that individuals
are powerless to change.
</P>
<P>
   If both sides work at avoiding the Dilbert Syndrome, it will
strengthen the company and advance people's careers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then both sides can laugh all the way to the bank.

B.C. TRIBE ON VERGE OF HISTORIC TREATY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VICTORIA, B.C. _ More than 111 years have passed since Nisga'a
Indians paddled canoes 650 miles from the remote Nass Valley, just
south of the Alaska Panhandle, to Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   They came to appeal for rights to ancestral lands they were
losing as the white man discovered the fish, forests and minerals
of British Columbia's northwest coast.
</P>
<P>
   The Nisga'a chiefs were spurned by then-premier William Smythe.
They were ignored in 1913 when they sent a petition asking the
British government to intervene and resolve the land question.
</P>
<P>
   But now, the B.C. Legislature and Canada's House of Commons
stand poised to approve a treaty that will give the 5,000-member
Indian tribe about 1,300 square miles of land, cash and powers of
self-government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're back,'' said Nisga'a Chief Joe Gosnell earlier this
month as drums pounded and tribal members arrived at a special
session of the B.C. Legislature called to ratify the Nisga'a Final
Agreement Act.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Gosnell stood at the door of the legislative
chamber to appeal for ratification. The accord will return to his
people control of fisheries and forest resources and law
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have worked for justice for more than a century,'' Gosnell
told lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   He was the first outsider permitted to speak from the entrance
to the chamber since two Indian chiefs appeared there in 1950 to
thank legislators for being given the right to vote.
</P>
<P>
   The pending agreement between the Nisga'as and the governments
of Canada and British Columbia has stirred passion both pro and
con.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid we are creating another Yugoslavia here,'' former
B.C. Premier Bill Vander Zalm said in a recent televised debate.
Nisga'a-governed land would be ``communistic in style'' and ``not
unlike a separate country,'' he argued.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters, including current Premier Glen Clark, insist that
the treaty is key to redeeming a litany of past injustices toward
natives, who comprise about 4 percent of British Columbia's
population.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an obligation'' to enact the treaty, Canada's prime
minister, Jean Chretien, said Tuesday in Vancouver. Chretien first
visited the Nisga'as and began land negotiations 30 years ago when
he was Indian affairs minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have subjected aboriginal people to a kind of apartheid,''
Clark told a recent labor convention. He praised the Nisga'as for
their ``integrity, perseverence, dignity and, above all, enormous
patience'' in pressing their claims.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's natives have needed a break. They live an average 10 to
12 years less than non-natives. Tribal infant mortality rates are
twice as high as the rest of the population.
</P>
<P>
   The provincial and federal governments long attemped to suppress
native culture. For example, it was illegal for Indians to stage
potlach ceremonies as recently as the 1950s. Native children were
long confined to residential schools. As a boy, Gosnell was taken
from his family and sent to a school at Alert Bay on Vancouver
Island, where he was forbidden to speak his native language.
</P>
<P>
   British Columbia is the one province in Canada that never
settled claims of natives whose traditional lands were taken during
settlement by whites. The Nisga'as and other tribes have long been
restricted to Indian reserves not large enough for a
self-sustaining economy. One law, passed in 1927, made it illegal
for three or more Indians to even get together for the purpose of
talking about land claims.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 Nisga'as were on hand when the B.C. Legislature
convened to take up the treaty. Members of the group sang, beat
drums and staged a ceremony at which names of ancestors were called
out. One Nisga'a, Harry Moore, shouted the name of Johnny Moore,
his great-great-grandfather and one of the Indians who paddled to
Victoria in 1887.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said the Nisga'a agreement will serve as a model for
settling 49 other aboriginal land claims across British Columbia's
vast 360,000 square miles of territory. The cost of settling all
these claims is expected to be as high as $8 billion (Canadian).
</P>
<P>
   The Nisga'a treaty is reminiscent of the 1971 Alaska Native
Claims Settlement Act, which bestowed more than 40 million acres of
land and millions of investment dollars on Alaska's natives.
</P>
<P>
   The Nisga'as are making concessions in the 252-page accord. They
will relinquish their tax-free status, and they will give up much
larger land claims against the government.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, they will get the right to pass laws superseding
federal and provincial law in 14 different areas. They will be
entitled to 26 percent of Nass River salmon for food, social and
ceremonial purposes. They will get extensive wildlife management
rights. And they will get $312 million (Canadian) over 15 years
from the federal and provincial governments. (All B.C. municipal
governments receive revenue from the provincial government.)
</P>
<P>
   While it will cost nearly $500 million (Canadian), the Nisga'a
treaty is seen by some economists as a boon to the British Columbia
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great deal of uncertainty about the future of these lands
will be lifted. It will mean a major infusion of investment
money,'' said Roslyn Kunin, president of the Laurier Institute, a
Vancouver think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Chretien has appealed for British Columbia business to support
the treaty, saying, ``It's much better for everybody to make sure
we settle (who owns land), or there will be a problem over the
business development in B.C. because there will be uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   The treaty will likely win approval by only a five-vote margin
in the 75-member B.C. Legislature. With Chretien promising to whip
lawmakers into line, the Nisga'a agreement should pass Canada's
House of Commons by a larger margin. Both votes are expected early
next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know there are naysayers, some sitting here today,''
Gosnell told the B.C. Legislature. He accused some unnamed
opponents of ``fanning the flames of fear and ignorance in this
province and reigniting a poisonous attitude so familiar to
aboriginal people.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, debate over the Nisga'a treaty in British Columbia has
echoed arguments heard in Washington's recent debate over Intiative
200, which centered on affirmative action programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in equality and that they (Nisga'as) should have
equal opportunities. I don't believe in special rights for a
special group of Canadians,'' wrote David Black, owner of 55 B.C.
newspapers, including most rural papers in the area where Nisga'a
lands are located.
</P>
<P>
   Black stirred controversy when he ordered his editors to write
editorials against the Nisga'a accord and authorized a series of
eight articles by a native land claims opponent denouncing the
treaty. He refused to give equal space to treaty supporters.
</P>
<P>
   In the B.C. Legislature, the opposition Liberal Party has
demanded a province-wide referendum on the accord. The Nisga'as
were permitted to vote on the treaty and ratified it in a recent
referendum.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberals' leader, former Vancouver mayor Gordon Campbell,
has raised the specter of treaties producing ``50 to 60 gated
communities that will divide us forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell has used phrases borrowed from affirmative action
opponents in the United States. He has denounced the Nisga'a accord
as ``social engineering'' that will create ``special status for one
group based on its ancestors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is folly to entrench in the Constitution a brand new third
order of government that is untried, unproven, unnecessary and
unacceptable to most British Columbians,'' Campbell told the
Legislature this week.
</P>
<P>
   Clark responded: ``The city of Vancouver has its own charter and
its own laws. This is not a third order of government.''
</P>
<P>
   A pro-treaty voice, B.C. Federation of Labor President Ken
Georgetti, has charged that Campbell speaks for ``the kind of
racist, paternalistic attitude the Nisga'a have had to fight for
more than 100 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Liberals have challenged the Nisga'a treaty in the B.C.
Supreme Court, arguing that it improperly amends Canada's
constitution by creating a new branch of government.
</P>
<P>
   Clark has hammered at one hard-to-refute argument. Indian
Reserves are, for the most part, a national disgrace. Alcoholism,
unemployment and crime have plagued native communities from remote
Tachie and Fort Ware in northern British Columbia to Mount Currie
near Whistler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year the federal government spends $650 million on
native Indians, keeping them in poverty on native reserves that
don't have land, capital or resources,'' the premier said.
</P>
<P>
   In Victoria, facing the government that so long spurned his
people, Gosnell declared proudly, ``We intend to be free and equal
citizens.''

`TEMPEST' STARTS STRONG, BUT PETERS OUT; FONDA IS WARMLY
EFFECTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oprah Winfrey isn't the only production megalith trying to bring
``important'' stories to American audiences. The entire TV-movie
division at NBC has committed itself to familiarizing American
audiences with classic stories from literature.
</P>
<P>
   Such noble resolve was easy to muster given the success of
``Gulliver's Travels'' and, more recently, ``The Odyssey'' and
``Merlin.'' But, just as Oprah and ABC discovered with ``David and
Lisa'' last month, NBC learned in October with ``Crime and
Punishment'' that America likes to take its literary medicine with
a little bit of sweetener.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, after ``Crime and Punishment'' attracted an even smaller
audience than NBC expected, the network's cheese trust decided to
pull ``The Tempest'' from its November schedule, fearful of
exposing a literary classic to mass indifference during an
important ratings period. In the obscurity of mid-December, ``The
Tempest'' will now be considered a success if it merely makes a
dent against ``The X-Files'' on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was a wise one. Though hardly a disaster, this
``Tempest'' is a morality play that works well for an hour or so,
and then begins to crumble in an allegorical war story that is more
confusing than enlightening. The result: A nice try, but not
completely satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   NBC is resting its hopes here on Peter Fonda, who brings to
``The Tempest'' the quiet intensity that got him an Oscar
nomination for his portrayal of a stoic Southern beekeeper in
``Ulee's Gold.''
</P>
<P>
   Fonda remains in the deep South for this earnest ``update'' of
Shakespeare's last play, transitioning smoothly from swarms to
storms. In the telling by ``Attica'' screenwriter Jim Henerson,
Prospero, duke of Milan, becomes Gideon Prosper, Mississippi
plantation owner.
</P>
<P>
   Fonda's Prosper is a kind-hearted man who loses interest in his
plantation after the death of his wife. He prefers to dabble in
magic and sorcery under the tutelage of a slave named Ezeli
(Donzaleigh Abernathy), leaving everyday business to his scoundrel
brother, Anthony (John Glover).
</P>
<P>
   Bad idea. Glover's Anthony is as nasty as the devil (which
Glover plays every Friday on ``Brimstone''). Gideon ends up exiled
to a bayou treehouse with his daughter, Miranda (Katherine Heigl),
and Ezeli's orphaned son, Ariel (Harold Perrineau Jr.). After 12
years, he's gotten pretty good at the magic, better still at
playing the hermit and instilling wholesome values in Miranda and
Ariel.
</P>
<P>
   While marginally faithful to Shakespeare's story, ``The
Tempest'' never achieves the dynamic impact implicit in the title,
even with the Civil War as a backdrop. Fonda is warmly effective as
the loving father who can whip up a storm at will and who wrestles
with questions of loyalty, independence, honor and duty. Heigl is
fresh and appealing as the daughter who's never known anything but
a sheltered life away from civilization.
</P>
<P>
   Special visual effects by the Frame Store, which also handled
``Gulliver,'' ``Odyssey'' and ``Merlin,'' are impressive. But, in
serving us Bard Lite, NBC has only made it obvious that ``less
filling'' doesn't work well in drama.
</P>
<P>
   The Tempest. A retelling of Shakespeare's mystical story of
honor and betrayal. Starring Peter Fonda, John Glover, Katherine
Heigl and Harold Perrineau Jr. Sunday night on NBC. Parental
guideline rating: TV-14.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-

ACTION-PACKED `INSURRECTION' HAS HARD TIME OVERCOMING PLOT, JARGON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If we applied old-style movie hype to ``Star Trek:
Insurrection''_ with a touch of irony _ it easily could sound like
this:
</P>
<P>
   See! Cadaverous, cranky bad guys obsessed with face lifts!
</P>
<P>
   Hear! Dialogue such as ``Reroute its command sequence through
the auxiliary processor!''
</P>
<P>
   Thrill! As good guys fight to preserve the status quo of a small
commune of boring, pacifist vegetarians!
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there are problems in the ``Trek'' universe.
</P>
<P>
   But you can't blame the cast of ``Star Trek: The Next
Generation,'' now in their third big-screen effort. The problems
stem from the screenplay by Michael Piller.
</P>
<P>
   Piller is co-creator of Trek's ``Voyager'' and ``Deep Space
Nine'' series, on which he served as executive producer. Here, he's
a first-time film screenwriter _ and it shows.
</P>
<P>
   As enjoyable as their interplay can be, the fine ``Next
Generation'' cast has had to grapple for years with plots laden by
stuffy idealism and tedious technical talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Trek: Insurrection'' is filled with both.
</P>
<P>
   Ably directed by Jonathan Frakes, who also plays Commander
William Riker, the film has ample action and enjoyable humor and
humanism. But its plot is driven by confounding jargon and rules
that Piller seems to make up as he goes along.
</P>
<P>
   The only rule he doesn't make up is ``Trek's'' most unmanageable
concept, touted since the '60s series and rarely observed
effectively: the Federation's ``prime directive.'' This means
nonintervention. You leave a planet and its denizens to their own
devices. Of course, the Federation good guys have broken the rule
many times, and in ``Insurrection'' they do so again.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to unexplained involvement by Lt. Commander Data (Brent
Spiner), Capt. Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) and his Enterprise
crew uncover a conspiracy between a Federation admiral (Anthony
Zerbe) and overtly hostile space farers called the Son'a.
</P>
<P>
   The Son'a want to extract the regenerative powers of the
Edenlike Ba'ku planet at the expense of its sole inhabitants: 600
inexplicably human colonists who live in what looks like a
California spa for the rich and idle. Via their planet's powers,
these folks are virtually immortal. Most are 300 years old, yet
look 40.
</P>
<P>
   The planet also heals.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Commander Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) overcomes his
blindness, and other officers feel young and frisky. But La Forge
realizes he could never enjoy seeing his first sunset if it came at
the expense of the Ba'ku folks, whose own alleged idealism seems to
preclude sharing.
</P>
<P>
   So the Enterprise defies the admiral and the age-obsessed Son'a
leader, Ru'afo (F. Murray Abraham), who spends half the film in
repulsive cosmetic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Picard leads the colonists in an armed retreat to mountain
caves, while Riker and the Enterprise race to tattle on the admiral
to the Federation.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, they are boldly running away, much as in
``Battlestar Galactica'' or the ``climb every mountain'' ending to
``The Sound of Music.''
</P>
<P>
   They do finally fight two spiffy space battles, in which the
computer-generated hardware looks nice. But what does it all mean?
</P>
<P>
   The action is driven by jargon-filled lines such as, ``They are
rotating their shield harmonics!'' _ which are difficult to figure
out.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the aging Son'a shouldn't steal this fountain of youth.
But couldn't its powers also help the Federation's ill or dying? As
earlier ``Trek'' films have taught, the needs of the many outweigh
the needs of the few.
</P>
<P>
   Your best bet is not to think too much and just enjoy precious
moments _ as Picard himself learns to do on Ba'ku.
</P>
<P>
   If you love this series' stars, rest assured you'll have plenty
of endearing moments in which to bask.
</P>
<P>
   Riker and Lt. Commander Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) enjoy a
candle-lit bubble bath, rekindling a romance that occurred early in
``Next Generation's'' run and, with TV's typical inertia, never was
pursued.
</P>
<P>
   Data also gets many cute bits, whether singing a song from one
of Spiner's beloved Broadway shows or commenting innocently on
female officers' enhanced endowments.
</P>
<P>
   As for the charismatic Stewart, whose stardom eclipses the
ensemble (he reportedly made $12 million for this), he kicks
bad-guy butt, dances a little mambo and romances Anij, a Ba'ku
woman (Donna Murphy).
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Goldsmith also supplies a solid score, though it often
merely echoes his fine ``Trek'' work of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he was uninspired by the script. We can't say that we
blame him. &QL;

SEEK INNER COMFORT AND JOY TO COMBAT HOLIDAY SADNESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``God Can Heal Your Wounded Heart'' is the holiday message
outside a church in Arlington, Texas. Why display such a sad
message in the holiday season? Curiously, it's a message that is
entirely appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   People often feel the greatest emotional pain during the holiday
season, say spiritual leaders and psychiatrists.
</P>
<P>
   I learned something about that years ago when I drew the
assignment of covering the police beat on Christmas Day. During my
four hours on the job during that holiday, I covered two separate
suicides.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Robin Webb, pastor of the Tabernacle Baptist Church,
where the ``wounded hearts'' sign is displayed, said people are
either very happy or very sad during the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no middle ground,'' Webb said. ``As Christians, we
believe our relationship to God can carry us through the sadness.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Howard Cutler, a Phoenix psychiatrist, said the holidays are
stressful for many reasons. If one has lost family or friends
through death or divorce, the holidays bring on feelings of
loneliness and isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Those with family feel tension as they brave crowded malls and
drive bumper-to-bumper on hazardous highways visiting relatives.
Even family gatherings often stir up painful memories of negative
relationships and disturbing events of childhood.
</P>
<P>
   So how do we cope with holiday sadness?
</P>
<P>
   Spiritual leaders and friends in churches, synagogues and
mosques can offer much help through their continued support, Cutler
said.
</P>
<P>
   And assistance can come from an often-overlooked source _ the
teachings of the world's most famous Buddhist, the Dalai Lama,
Cutler says.
</P>
<P>
   Cutler called attention to the Dalai Lama because he has
collaborated with him on a new book, ``The Art of Happiness,''
released this month by Riverhead Books ($22.95).
</P>
<P>
   ``I truly believe the Dalai Lama has found the secret of
happiness,'' said Cutler, who is Jewish. ``Whether you are
Christian, Jewish or some other faith, you can profit from the
teachings of the Dalai Lama.''
</P>
<P>
   He met Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, in 1981 after
receiving a grant from the University of Arizona to travel to
Dharamsala, India. Later, they met in Arizona and other locations.
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama, whose buoyant personality is well-known to many
Americans, has found that happiness isn't determined by external
factors, Cutler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Happiness to the Dalai Lama is a feeling of joy and sense of
inner contentment that results from developing a calm, stable state
of mind, rooted in affection and compassion,'' Cutler said. ``His
overall approach to attaining happiness involves working on
overcoming negative states of mind such as anger, hatred, greed,
etc.''
</P>
<P>
   Easier said than done, Cutler admits. But it can be achieved, he
said, by focusing on certain principles embraced by Christianity,
Judaism and most of the world's other religions.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of Cutler's strategies for confronting the holiday
season:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Reset priorities and set aside a quiet time each day to
think of the true sources of happiness in life. Does happiness
result from making more money, enjoying greater career success or
having a better body? Or does it arise from inner qualities such as
kindness, tolerance and forgiveness?''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Count your blessings. Simplistic as it may seem, you can in
fact change your life by focusing on the things we have in life
rather than on the things we wish we had.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Reach out to others. The conscious decision to help others,
even in a small way, can transform your holiday season into one of
joy.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether they are Buddhists or Baptists, we applaud those who
seek to give aid and comfort to those with ``wounded hearts.''

FIRMS OFFER CLASSES TO SWEETEN LAYOFFS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Losing your job is about as tough as it gets. It
doesn't really make any difference if you get cut loose because
your company filed for bankrupcty or because you were a lousy
employee _ it's still extremely painful.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first worries is how to find another job.
</P>
<P>
   To help ease that transition, many employers offer severance
pay, continue to subsidize the cost of medical insurance for a time
and offer outplacement assistance.
</P>
<P>
   But some employers take it a step further and offer their
severed employees an educational grant to get them started in a new
career or let them beef up their existing skills.
</P>
<P>
   Amoco Corp., for example, is offering the employees it lets go
as part of its merger with British Petroleum a $5,000 educational
grant ($2,500 for part-timers) that can be used for 24 months after
they've left the company. The oil company will reimburse its
employees up to 85 percent of the cost of classes.
</P>
<P>
   It's a difficult time and Amoco wanted to ensure that its
employees got the best available benefits, said spokeswoman Vicki
Kastory from Chicago. The educational assistance will help
employees find new jobs, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The grants are a good way for a lawyer to pick up mediation
skills or for someone to start a master's degree, said Robin
Kessler, president of The Interview Coach, a firm that trains
companies how to properly handle the ``exit process.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
PEOPLE WANT KNOWLEDGE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Educational assistance programs have been around for some time.
Back in 1988, IBM offered employees taking early retirement $2,500
in educational assistance to help them and their spouses, said Bill
Hollett, vice president of the national project team for Drake Beam
Morin, an outplacement firm.
</P>
<P>
   IBM expected its retiring employees to take golfing and flying
classes but instead, they took computer and business classes to
help them find a new job or start life as a consultant, said
Hollett, speaking from the firm's Stamford, Conn., office.
</P>
<P>
   The educational help was popular with departing employees, and
other companies jumped on the bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   Educational assistance seems to be more popular now, said
Hollett, who recommends it when he is hired to design a severance
plan.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good corporate citizen move, said Hollett. It's hard to
think badly of a company that helps its departing employees retool.
</P>
<P>
   It's also not very expensive, said Hollett. At one company that
makes photographic supplies, only 25 percent of the eligible
employees participated.
</P>
<P>
   Many senior-level employees don't use the assistance because
they feel they have what they need to get another job and they have
a network of contacts to rely upon, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The money, which typically ranges from $2,500 to $7,500, is used
more by lower- and mid-level employees, who see it as a chance to
go back to get a master's degree or some computer classes.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are exceptions, he said, recalling a corporate
lawyer at a chemical company who used the money to get a specialty
in patent law.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A GESTURE OF CARING &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At Chase Bank of Texas, 52 percent of departing employees use
the bank's educational assistance program, said Gretchen Harris,
manager of employee relations. The bank gives its departing full-
and part-time employees $2,500 in educational assistance that can
be used for courses as varied as English literature or computer
repair.
</P>
<P>
   The job market is so good right now that many departing
employees join another company quickly and don't return to school
for classes, Harris said. And many departing employees already
acquired new skills because the bank sent them to courses during
their tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Employees who do want to return to school can do it even after
they've landed another job, said Harris. Lots of workers may take a
job that doesn't fit into their career path or they don't
particularly like but need to pay the bills _ and that shouldn't
eliminate them from using the educational grant, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-employees are also free to return to Chase to take the bank's
own classes such as management training, time management and
computer courses.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, educational assistance and severance benefits
help departing employees. But the assistance also sends a strong
message to current employees that the bank cares, Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Severance benefits are an important retention tool because they
let existing employees know that if the bank doesn't need their
services any longer, they won't be out on the street without a
safety net.

THUMBS UP FOR THE NEW MERCEDES M CLASS SUV 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)  
 (For release Sunday, December 13, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R.WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in September, we introduced readers to the new high-powered
version of the Mercedes-Benz M Class
sport/utility/van/whatevermobile, the ML430 with its brand new
268-horsepower V-8 engine. Back then, the columnist had been
favorably impressed by the quickness, agility, and go-anywhere
ability of this new Benz. (Well, go almost anywhere; it won't swim,
it won't fly, and it does not leap tall buildings at a single
bound.) But the proof of a car is living with it over the long
term.
</P>
<P>
   The 4.3-liter V-8 in the 430 will take you from 0 to 60 in a
smidgen more than six seconds _ this is extreme acceleration
potential in a utility package. The price of performance, as we all
know, is fuel appetite. With that performance, there is the
off-road capability of the ML430; it is full-time 4-wheel drive
with a two-speed electronic transfer case for low-range operation
in the muck and mire, sand and snow. As we all know, 4-wheel-drive
off-roaders gobble gas. The ML430 would appear to be twice damned
here _ a plow horse built for speed eats like a lot of horse.
</P>
<P>
   And there is the room and luxury appointments. This is a fairly
large, roomy vehicle _ 4,552 pounds curbside with a 5,000-pound tow
capacity. Not much hope for economy here.
</P>
<P>
   It is, however, EPA rated at 15 miles per gallon city, 18
highway, quite respectable for an SUV of any capacity and better by
some than a few high-priced SUVs that don't do nearly as much
nearly as well. Still, you might be willing to sacrifice the
performance and settle for the 215-hp V-6-powered sibling ML320,
EPA rated 17/21 _ and less money in the bargain.
</P>
<P>
   But the test is living with it, feeding it, driving it over the
long term. OK, we've tested. It's still a winner. And it would seem
that the EPA has missed something here. If you take the city number
and the highway number, somewhere in between is the real everyday
number, the so-called combined average. Almost never in real life
does one actually get that highway number _ except maybe when the
EPA is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Your columnist kept track for 900.7 miles; the ML430 delivered
18.66 miles per gallon over the measured distance. Part of that
mileage was a section of high-speed highway driving with the
five-speed automatic transmission accidentally locked out of
overdrive (driver error), and part of the time was with a moderate
load. A good part of the driving was the around-town sort, and the
routes covered a variety of terrain, everything from the
ramp-of-the-week in the muddle?? of Boston's Big Dig to dirt road
and a wee bit of snow. The ML430 delivered a measured 18.66 miles
per gallon, more than the estimated highway average.
</P>
<P>
   For laughs, I measured one more tankful: 18.68. The beast is
consistent.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is price. The base ML430 is $43,750 plus $595
delivery _ the 320 is $34,950. The tested ML430 had a few extras
that brought the total delivered price to $48,085, about 2 1/2
times what I once paid for a house. The extras included tubular
chrome side runners and brush guard; the side runners look like
fancy exhaust pipes but really serve as a running board. The brush
guard reminds me of a chrome footboard on a single bed. That
package includes mud flaps for $1,595. Also extra were a Bose
premier audio system with a CD changer ($1,050), and a glass
sunroof ($1,095).
</P>
<P>
   Aren't all sunroofs glass? you ask. Not with the ML430. For a
mere $2,395 extra, you may forgo the glass option and get a
sectional metal roof that slides open and stacks the sections like
venetian blinds to offer a roof hole ranging in size from a
generous slit to a full three-foot by four-foot hole. With that,
however, it would probably be wise to avoid loading anything on the
roof, rack or no.
</P>
<P>
   If you opt for the standard model, you do not come away
ill-equipped; the ML430 offers a lengthy array of standard
equipment, including a few items besides the V-8 that you won't get
standard on the less expensive 320 _ trip computer, rear privacy
glass, heated seats, a lockable storage drawer under the front
passenger seat, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the standard technology that impresses. In addition to
front and side air bags, the M series offers the Benz Electronic
Stability Program as standard equipment and the new emergency brake
assist system. The ESP senses yaw _ imminent slip _ and corrects
instantly. The emergency brake assist senses panic stops and
immediately applies maximum brake pedal pressure whether the driver
is able to or not. Antilock brakes are standard and the
4-wheel-drive system employed relies on electronically controlled
traction assist rather than locking differentials _ if you can get
traction on one wheel, you can keep the ML moving. The five-speed
tranmission is electronically managed, too, adapts to the
individual's driving style, and resists sudden shift changes as
grades change.
</P>
<P>
   The only real problem with a car so equipped is driver
overconfidence; no electronic system can compensate effectively for
recklessness.
</P>
<P>
   Off road, the 430 is gentler than a standard 4 x 4 truck; on
road it is stiffer than a standard luxury sedan. Handling is very
precise. The ride is very comfortable, more carlike than SUV-ish.
Visibility is quite good, although you are not as high off the
pavement as in traditional SUVs; the step-up height is more akin to
a sedan than a truck, so most people could well afford to skip the
fancy side runners. The bumpers, too, match sedan height, something
neighbors in sedans might appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   Interior storage is pretty good _ that drawer, door bins, and
various other bins offer storage room. There are no seat pockets;
the backs are scooped a bit to offer kneeroom, which is ample.
Headroom, too, is abundant.
</P>
<P>
   Benz has succumbed to the cupholder demands of Americans and has
come up with what has to be the most elegant design in the front of
the vehicle. At either end of the dash, one presses, and a polished
cupholder unfolds from its hiding place, folds back up at a touch _
so don't bump it with your knee while there's a beverage in there,
lest you wind up wearing some of it. A couple of cupholders fold
out from the center console for the rear passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The rear seat, by the way, is split three ways, folds down,
folds forward for more cargo space.
</P>
<P>
   The dash in the ML is different from that in other Mercedes
models, especially the radio controls, which are much more
convenient in the ML than in other Mercedeses _ but I wish Benz
would join in the common labeling practices. I prefer separate
selectors for AM, FM, CD, not the single button labeled ``mode.''
There is where multiplicity is simplicity _ you select what you
want rather than going through a whole cycle by strumming the
``mode'' button. Hey, I have to find something to complain about,
otherwise you might not take me seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Thumbs up, even if I can't afford one.

EVEN BEST GAMES HAVE A HALF LIFE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been five years since id Software turned the PC gaming
world upside down with Doom, the first-person, 3-D shooter that
made the phrase ``death match'' a household word. Well, at least in
households with computers, fast modems and twitchy young males.
</P>
<P>
   And, in my household. If you read this column regularly, you
know that I am a big fan of good 3-D action titles, largely because
I think they represent the state-of-the-art of game technology.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to more powerful computers, advances in graphics display
and better artificial intelligence, 3-D games have come a long way
since the pixilated monsters that stalked Doom. They are far more
immersive and, most recently, they actually have begun to offer
interesting plot lines that go far beyond ``if it moves, kill it.''
</P>
<P>
   Game designers also have been focusing on the multiplayer aspect
of their games, in which players duke it out with each other,
rather than battling computer-controlled bad guys. The popularity
of the Internet has made this easy _ someone sets up a server in
cyberspace, and players from all over connect to play, often for
free.
</P>
<P>
   If you've never tried this, I urge you to do so _ it is an
astounding experience, and I believe it's the future of
entertainment. A century from now, people will look back on the
makers of these games in the same way that we look at film pioneers
such as Cecil B. DeMille and D.W. Griffith today.
</P>
<P>
   Often game designers make either a great single-player game, or
a great multiplayer game, but not both. Two highly anticipated
titles, out in time for the holiday season, illustrate this
dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   _ Half-Life, $55, Sierra Studios: Usually, when a game receives
as much pre-release hoopla as Half-Life did, there's a serious
letdown once players actually get it on their hard drives. In a
rare case of reality beating expectations, the developers at
Seattle-based Valve have done better than the hype indicated.
</P>
<P>
   It is the best first-person 3-D game ever, dethroning id's Quake
II. Beautiful graphics, intelligent design, a compelling plot line
and superbly timed action take this far beyond the standard shooter
fare. However, to finish the game you do have to kill a lot of
monsters _ and a good number of humans, too.
</P>
<P>
   In the game you are Gordon Freeman, a low-level researcher at
the top-secret Black Mesa research facility. Exactly what the
scientists at Black Mesa are studying is unclear, but in the
stunning introductory sequence you're warned about avoiding
radiation and staying healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Donning a protective suit, you are ordered by your bosses to
enter a chamber to help with a test. But something goes horribly
wrong, and in a visually spectacular scene a hole is ripped between
this world and another dimension. All kinds of creepy, dangerous
things pass through.
</P>
<P>
   When you exit the chamber, you find chaos. Several hideous
creatures are chowing down on your colleagues _ and trying to make
a tasty lunch out of you.
</P>
<P>
   As the game progresses, things get complicated. The military has
been brought in to clean up the mess by killing everything _
including the scientists and workers and, of course, you. You not
only must do battle with monsters, but also your own kind.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, in a 3-D shooter, your job is to obliterate everything
in sight. But not in Half-Life. If you shoot that guard over there
_ or fail to protect him from a monster _ you might not be able to
get through a door that only he can open. If you don't stop and
talk to that scientist in the next room, you may not get the
information you need to move on to another level.
</P>
<P>
   Half-Life is as much an adventure game as a shooter _ it's full
of puzzles and situations you must figure out before you can
advance. However, they are not too hard. Serious adventure gamers
would consider the puzzles here fairly lightweight.
</P>
<P>
   The intelligence of your enemies is very impressive. Monsters
will duck behind boxes and pillars to avoid your fire, or use sound
to track your movements. The soldiers hunting you will try to
encircle you, executing classic battle strategy. If you begin to
beat them, they will actually retreat.
</P>
<P>
   The single-player part of Half-Life is the closest I've seen a
computer game come to giving you the feeling that you are a
character in a movie.
</P>
<P>
   The multiplayer part, though, is just adequate. While the levels
you play make for interesting death-match scenarios, the weapons
are unbalanced. Players who acquire certain high-powered guns are
going to lay waste quickly to those who haven't. And increasing
your health requires that you plug into a first-aid station and
continuously press a key to power back up, leaving you a sitting
duck in the process.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sin, $50, Activision: In Sin, you play John Blade, a
tough-talking cop out to stop Elexis Sinclair, the chief executive
of a biochemical company who is creating an army of mutants to take
over the world. Sinclair is the latest in a line of female
computer-game characters who are ridiculously top-heavy. But while
Tomb Raider's Lara Kroft is a good guy, Sinclair is pure evil.
</P>
<P>
   Blade is aided by J.C., a young hacker who provides spoken
hints, suggestions and warnings. The banter between these two is
informative, but often irritating. There's no way to turn J.C. off,
unfortunately.
</P>
<P>
   Sin begins spectacularly, with Blade shooting at bank robbers
from a helicopter. But the action soon moves to the ground, where
Sin becomes your basic 3-D shooter that's highly derivative of Duke
Nukem 3D. Blade makes macho comments as he mows down his opponents,
and the environment is highly interactive. Pay phones work, drawers
slide open, money machines dispense badly needed cash.
</P>
<P>
   The artificial intelligence in the Sin baddies is not quite as
good as in Half-Life, but there is one interesting feature here.
When you shoot someone in the leg, it affects only their leg _ the
character grabs a knee, for example. Shoot them in the head, and
they'll go right down.
</P>
<P>
   Sin suffers from some serious technical problems. The version
you install out of the box takes forever to load between levels. A
10-megabyte patch that helps somewhat is available at
www.activision.com. There are other bugs that make single-player
Sin more frustrating than it should be.
</P>
<P>
   But where Sin really shines is in death-match mode. Where
Half-Life is the best single-player 3-D shooter, Sin now wears the
crown for best multiplayer title.
</P>
<P>
   Sin comes with numerous death-match-only levels, including seven
named for the deadly sins. Another one takes place at night on a
faithfully rendered offshore oil rig (Ritual Entertainment, the
game's developer, is based in Dallas), complete with a sniper's
perch atop the derrick.
</P>
<P>
   But the best death-match level, available with the patch, is
like playing in a drawing by surrealist M.C. Escher. Paradox has
multiple stairs and platforms, so that one player's ceiling might
be another's floor, or wall.
</P>
<P>
   The weapons are perfectly balanced in Sin death match. For
example, the most powerful gun requires that you hold the trigger
to build up power. The longer you hold it, the more damaging the
blast, but _ hold it too long and it explodes in your face.
</P>
<P>
   If only you could graft Sin's death-match onto Half-Life's
single-player experience, you'd have 3-D-shooter nirvana.

exchanged. By Barbara De Witt.

A WEB SITE FOR AN E-MAIL MOVIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's been called the biggest product placement in
movie history, but you don't need to be on America Online to enjoy
the great Web site for ``You've Got Mail.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nora Ephron movie, starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, opens
next week and is based on two people striking up an online romance,
not realizing that they run rival bookstores on New York's Upper
West Side. The movie's title refers, of course, to the audio that
plays when AOL users get e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The site (www.youvegotmail.com) has, naturally, lots of
Net-minded touches, including free Web space and e-mail from
Fortune City (AOL? Who's that?); bulletin board discussions; and
free desktop patterns, icons and Web postcards for Macintosh and
Windows.
</P>
<P>
   There's background info on cast and crew; audio clips from
Ephron; even a tour of the Upper West Side. Another area has links
to literacy groups and promises an interactive version of Kipling's
``How the Leopard Got His Spots.''
</P>
<P>
   But the area that I, or at least the romantic in me, liked best
was devoted to dozens of peoples' submissions of their own true Net
romance stories, a subject that also occupies part of the bulletin
board postings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened to me ... I'm gonna get married to this girl,''
wrote Plain Old Me. ``Yeah, it's nuts, but who cares ... It makes
me happy ... there (are) a lot of fish in the pond ... and the pond
just got bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   DREAMING OF A `WHITE' CD: Tired of all those goofy Christmas
music collections? Well, make your own goofy collection and curse
no more this yuletide, at least about music.
</P>
<P>
   MUSICMAKER.COM has a special holiday music section of 400-plus
tracks, including nine versions of ``White Christmas'' and 12 of
``Silent Night.'' Pick out your Xmas faves, and Musicmaker will put
them on CD for you for between $10 and $20. Most songs can also be
downloaded in Liquid Audio format so you can create your own disc,
or just listen on the computer.
</P>
<P>
   BETTER LATE THAN NEVER: Among the late-arriving games that may
be worth a look for your family as you finish up holiday shopping:
</P>
<P>
   TOMB RAIDER III, meaning Lara Croft will have yet another chance
to loom large, or at least large-busted, in the hearts of
adventure-loving PC gamers. And for Macintosh gamers, Tomb Raider
II is coming out as well.
</P>
<P>
   RAILROAD TYCOON II is a classy PC strategy game about building a
railroad empire in the last century. One of the most-awaited titles
of the season _ and worth it.
</P>
<P>
   STAR WARS ROGUE SQUADRON lets you take on the bad ol' Galactic
Empire's forces on the ground and in the air in your X-Wing,
Y-Wing, A-Wing or V-Wing fighter, or on a snowspeeder. Pretty
darned cool, and you don't even have to wait for ``The Phantom
Menace'' to debut for your holiday ``Star Wars'' fix. For Nintendo
64.
</P>
<P>
   S.C.A.R.S. is a futuristic racing game with a lot to like: Lots
of tracks, funky vehicles, good visuals, and fun weapons to shoot
at competitors and slow them down. For both PlayStation and N64.
</P>
<P>
   BRAVE FENCER MUSASHI is yet another role-playing PlayStation
adventure from SquareSoft _ and quite entertaining. This one is
more like an adventure game, given the substantial amount of
fast-paced head-to-head fighting. The graphics are nicely done, and
the story line is pretty good, though it somewhat spoon-feeds the
hard stuff to you.
</P>
<P>
   TINY TOONS ADVENTURES: The Great Beanstalk is one of the few
PlayStation games pitched directly for younger children, using the
fun characters from Steven Spielberg's animated series. It feels
more like a PC title, with lots of clicking, exploring and puzzles.
But it's challenging for littler ones.
</P>
<P>
   FOX SPORT COLLEGE HOOPS '99 is a well-done N64 basketball game
with 120 Division I college teams. Because of NCAA rules, the game
can't use real players' names, but the virtual versions are pretty
close. For instance, my alma mater, the University of Missouri, has
a massive virtual center just like Monte ``Too Large'' Harge, the
6-foot-10, 335-pound behemoth on the real team.
</P>
<P>
   FATAL ABYSS is a 3-D PC shooter game with a twist: It's
underwater. Comes with free Internet gaming access. Publisher
SegaSoft also just released Vigilance, where you and seven more
anti-terrorism specialists hunt down postmodern bad guys.

HANUKKAH EVENTS AT SKIRBALL
</HEADLINE>

ILLUMINATION INSPIRATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROL BIDWELL 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hope takes many forms this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   A striking sculpture of green glass. A rustic collection of clay
figures. A majestic stand of liberty statues.
</P>
<P>
   Each poised to carry eight flames symbolizing the hope, freedom
and miracles celebrated during Hanukkah.
</P>
<P>
   It may be most familiar as a simple nine-branch candelabra, but
collectors _ who today pay anywhere from a few dollars to several
thousand _ long have been enjoying the menorah as art.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hanukkah lamp is truly artwork,'' said Nancy Berman,
director of the Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles. ``There's
no requirement that they all look the same way, only that they do
what they're supposed to do. The need is to have something that
provides light for eight nights.''
</P>
<P>
   Artists from far and wide have personalized the meaningful
display, creating a wealth of choices for admirers _ no matter what
their faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the weeks before Hanukkah, we've sold a lot,'' said Raquel
Cervantes, a clerk at People's Pottery in The Oaks mall in Thousand
Oaks. ``Some people are interested in the pieces as artworks _
they're handcrafted, and people can really see the art _ but some
people just buy a piece because they like the way it looks.''
</P>
<P>
   Most early menorahs were traditional in design, fitted with
candleholders or tiny lamps for oil.
</P>
<P>
   The annual celebration of Hanukkah re-enacts a tale from
Maccabees I and II in the Apocrypha in which a group of Jewish
guerrilla fighters overcame the reigning, oppressive Syrians in 167
B.C. Despite finding only a tiny vial of oil to sanctify the
formerly Syrian-held temple for one day, that flame miraculously
burned for eight.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Hanukkah, which is sometimes called the Festival of
Lights, lasts for eight days _ one branch in the traditional
menorah for each day, with a ninth to hold a special candle called
the shamas (servant) that is used to light the others.
</P>
<P>
   But artisans began centuries ago to make the religious objects
more decorative.
</P>
<P>
   Unusual Hanukkah lamps (also called a hanukkiah) have been
inspired by everything from an artist's own family history to the
popular architecture of the period, said Berman, who's written a
book on Hanukkah art.
</P>
<P>
   The moment German immigrant Manfred Anson saw Lady Liberty's
face on that island in New York Harbor, he fell in love.
</P>
<P>
   The jeweler and opal importer began collecting Statue of Liberty
souvenirs and, when he retired, used his jeweler's skills to create
a grand tribute marrying his religion with his new homeland: He
fashioned a Hanukkah lamp featuring nine miniatures of the
welcoming statue, plus a stately American eagle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be nice to combine the Statue of Liberty
with a Hanukkah menorah because both are actually symbols of
freedom,'' Anson, 76, said in a telephone interview from his New
Jersey home. ``It would create something Jewish and something
American at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   The candle-holding statues were each molded from a $1 souvenir
originally sold between 1876 and 1883 to raise money to build a
base to hold the Statue of Liberty, donated to America by the
French.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of a New Jersey foundry, Anson _ who came to the
United States via Australia in 1963 _ has created 31 similar
nine-branched lamps, which he sells to collectors at $5,000 each _
but he kept the 1985 original, which he'll light Sunday night as
this year's observance of Hanukkah begins.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the duplicates Anson made are on display _ one in the
Statue of Liberty Museum in New York, the other at the Skirball
Cultural Center in Los Angeles, where director Berman calls it
``our favorite menorah.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Hanukkah lamps in the Skirball collection are priceless.
Most were acquired by collectors before World War II, although
wartime Judaica hidden from or captured by the Nazis is beginning
to surface in Europe, and the museum hopes to acquire some of those
pieces.
</P>
<P>
   In the museum's rotating exhibit, a traditional Hanukkah
menorah, made of silver, bears the crest of the House of
Rothschild, a wealthy European banking family in the mid-1800s. A
German lamp, dating from 1813, features a massive silver tableau
backdrop of a village scene, with open lions' mouths the vessels
for the oil.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, a modern lamp commissioned by the Skirball is all
lines and angles and triangles, pink and green and chrome, with the
candleholders all but hidden at the top of the architectural
creation.
</P>
<P>
   Another recent acquisition features Mickey and Minnie Mouse
spinning a dreidel, a top used in a game played during Hanukkah,
before a fireplace, with places in front of the scene for nine
candles.
</P>
<P>
   Modern menorahs sold in retail stores run the gamut of design,
from traditional to modern to futuristic _ made of clay, pewter,
wood, glass, chrome and welded metals as well as the traditional
silver, gold and brass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Menorahs vary so much, you're limited only by your own
creativity in what you buy. You can have whatever you like,
whatever fits in your home, in your life,'' said Robert Goldstein,
owner of House of Judaica gift shop in Woodland Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein sells everything from children's wooden menorahs for
less than $10 to $2,500 lamps handcrafted out of clay by Al
Greenberg, a Marina del Rey artist.
</P>
<P>
   The clay menorahs _ which depict traditional Old World Jews,
some at Jerusalem's Wailing Wall, others holding the Torah or
wearing prayer shawls _ are the result of a sculpting class he took
at West Los Angeles College several years ago, said 73-year-old
Greenberg, a retired motion-picture cameraman and tire dealer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fell in love with clay,'' the artist said. ``I made masks, I
made vases, and nobody was much interested in them. Then I
remembered my grandfather, who was a Jewish pioneer in Los Angeles,
and I began to make Judaic art.''
</P>
<P>
   The first piece he made was a Hanukkah lamp, fashioned after a
photograph his late wife took of him and their son in front of the
Wailing Wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an icon for Jews everywhere,'' Greenberg said. He
showed his completed work to a gallery owner, and a new career as a
sculptor was born. He's since sold dozens of pieces and has others
on display at galleries throughout Southern California. No two are
alike.
</P>
<P>
   But then that's exactly what collectors want _ a unique display
to add to the mix, says Bilha Talmi of Agoura Hills, who works at
People's Pottery, where you'll find menorahs selling for $65 to
more than $300.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year, you buy one, through time, through life,'' Talmi
said. ``Most people get to have at least a dozen. It's kind of nice
to find different kinds.''

NEW GM PICKUPS ARE SOMETHING SPECIAL
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by CARS-GLANCE) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   General Motors has rolled out big guns in its truck shootout
with Ford, and the GM arsenal includes two brands, not one.
</P>
<P>
   I've already told you about the all-new 1999 Chevrolet Silverado
pickups, introduced in September, the first major redesign of the
full-size Chevy trucks in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   But the GMC truck division also has its version of the new
pickups, called the Sierra, and if you thought the new Chevy trucks
were something special, you've got to check out the 1999 Sierra.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the Silverado and Sierra start out the same underneath.
But GMC has been positioning itself as a premium-vehicle marketer,
so the Sierra models have much more standard equipment and
amenities than the Chevy, and you can't buy a stripped-down
version.
</P>
<P>
   The two vehicles also look different: the Sierra has the
distinctive GMC hood and grille, as well as unique fenders, bumper,
fascia and headlights. Engine choices are identical: a V-6 and
three V-8s. GMC trucks come in three trim levels: base SL, SLE and
top-of-the-line SLT.
</P>
<P>
   The differences between the GMCs and Chevys make the Sierra the
Cadillac of pickups. Our test model _ the four-wheel-drive 1500
extended-cab model with the Sportside (step-side) short cargo box
and Z-71 off-road package _ is about as fancy as an
off-road-capable pickup can get.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you pay extra for all the amenities that come with a
GMC pickup, so the list price for ours was a hefty $33,416
(including $640 transportation). But lesser-equipped models start
at $15,955 (with two-wheel drive).
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra SLE comes with lots of standard equipment _ including
power windows/door locks, air-conditioning, four-wheel disc brakes
with antilock system, dual front air bags with a passenger-side
cut-off switch, five chrome-plated steel wheels, chrome front
bumper, fog lamps, dual electric outside mirrors, fancy instrument
cluster with a driver information center and tachometer,
leather-wrapped steering wheel, swing-out rear quarter-panel
windows, tilt steering wheel, and cruise control.
</P>
<P>
   The frame is stronger than before, the V-8 engines are all new
and more powerful than ever, and even the brakes are far superior
to those of the previous Chevy trucks and any of the competition.
Four-wheel disc brakes are standard across the line.
</P>
<P>
   The base engine for the Chevy and GMC models is a 4.3-liter V-6,
standard on two- and four-wheel-drive 1500s. It cranks out 200
horsepower and 260 foot-pounds of torque.
</P>
<P>
   Three all-new Vortec V-8 engines are available on the GMCs, but
the biggest, a 6.0-liter, 300-horsepower mammoth is not offered on
the half-ton (1500) trucks; you have to go to the three-quarter-ton
(2500) models for the big engine.
</P>
<P>
   The two V-8s on the 1500 series are based on the legendary GM
small-block V-8 design. The 4.8-liter is rated at 255 horsepower
and 285 foot- pounds of torque; the 5.3-liter at 270 horsepower and
315 foot-pounds of torque. Our SLE came with the 5.3-liter, at an
extra cost of $700.
</P>
<P>
   A five-speed manual gearbox is standard on lower-priced models,
but our SLE came with the smooth-shifting four-speed automatic
transmission with no extra charge. This transmission and engine
combination gave the Sierra outstanding power in all situations:
starting from a dead stop, merging into freeway traffic, passing on
two-lane roads and even climbing hills.
</P>
<P>
   As an avid off-roader who has spent countless hours in the wild,
I heartily recommend the automatic transmission for serious
backwoods and desert exploring. A manual transmission might seem
more macho, but you'll hate it the first time you lose traction
shifting gears on a steep, slippery uphill slope.
</P>
<P>
   Ride and handling for the Sierra are remarkably carlike, and
braking power is awesome. I've never experienced brakes this good
on a pickup; they are racing quality.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Sierra extended-cab's best attributes is its
roominess. The back seat is almost as big as that of a crew-cab
pickup, and three adults will find it very comfortable, especially
when compared with the Ford F- 150 or Dodge Ram.
</P>
<P>
   For serious off-roading, our Sierra was equipped with the
optional locking rear differential ($$270), and we also had
off-road tires ($365), front fog lamps ($140) and a heavy-duty
trailering package ($285). With this package, the four-wheel-drive
Sierra can pull a trailer of up to 8,000 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Other extras included a ``comfort'' package ($565) with front
bucket seats and an excellent AM/FM/cassette/compact-disc stereo;
an electric rear-window defogger ($154), and deep-tinted glass
($107).
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy ratings are 15 mpg gallon in the city and 18
mpg on the highway for the 5.3-liter V-8. The fuel tank of the
Sportside short-bed model holds 26 gallons of gasoline.

EVERYBODY WHO'S ANYBODY DOES FIRE AND ICE BALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Los Angeles is fast becoming a tent city.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by circuses and European fashion shows, party planners
are finding huge tents to give galas a fashionable edge. Not only
can they transform a parking lot into a ballroom and provide
shelter from the Santa Ana winds, but their plain white walls are a
blank canvas, ready for the artistry of a creative party planner
like Ben Bourgeois.
</P>
<P>
   It was designer-to-the-stars Bourgeois who created all the eye
candy at Revlon/UCLA's Fire &AMP; Ice Ball, held Wednesday night at
Universal Studios. Using Revlon's ``ice'' theme, he turned the tent
into a giant diamond with photo imagery, stage lights and Lucite.
As guests entered the tent, they stepped onto a clear Lucite
platform and down the illuminated stairs onto clear glass pathways
featuring chunks of ice _ or diamonds _ underneath.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 1,300 guests were some of Hollywood's brightest stars
and East Coast celebs, including John F. Kennedy Jr.'s wife,
Carolyn, who attended with her husband's cousins Bobby and Maria
Shriver. Kennedy said New York had wonderful galas, but she and her
husband decided Fire &AMP; Ice was a worthy cause ... and a chance for
her to wear a stunning winter white wool gown by Donatella Versace,
who was the guest of honor at the gala that earned $1.8 million for
the Revlon/UCLA Women's Cancer Research Program.
</P>
<P>
   Others wearing Versace gowns included Revlon supermodel Cindy
Crawford, who chose a silvery-white gown with fur trim on the
shoulder straps; Madonna in basic black, Neve Campbell in lavender
sequins, Fran Drescher in mauve sequins, and Candice Bergen, who,
with teeth chattering, said of her pale gray almost-a-dress with
matching chiffon stole, ``I'm sacrificing my health to wear this
Versace.''
</P>
<P>
   Several members of the ``Friends'' cast were there, too,
including Courteney Cox, who told me both she and her fiance, David
Arquette, were wearing Versace. And, no, they haven't bought a ring
or set a date ... yet.
</P>
<P>
   Honorary gala chairman Jerry Seinfeld, who said he now has
absolutely nothing to do but read the papers, was a fashion rebel
and wore Armani. Ditto with ``Frasier'' co-star David Hyde Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Carey, who came with his sitcom co-star Christa Miller,
made it a point to tell me his tuxedo was by American designer
Hickey-Freeman. ``I'm kinda big, and they fit me well,'' he
commented.
</P>
<P>
   Other celebs in attendance were Jack Nicholson, Dina Merrill,
Kim Delaney, Rupert Everett, Dylan McDermott, Camryn Manheim,
Dennis Hopper, Ted Danson, Sidney Poitier, Goldie Hawn, Jennifer
Tilly, Debbe Dunning, Lisa Kudrow, Lynn Redgrave, Judith Light,
Kelsey Grammer and Charles Bronson, the tough-guy actor who
chuckled over Versace's rhinestone-trimmed menswear and felt bad
for the young models who obviously hadn't had a lot of practice
walking in their stiletto-heeled sandals.
</P>
<P>
   But overall, the spring '99 fashion preview was a razzle-dazzle
presentation with plenty of slinky evening gowns and tuxedos,
accented with a vaultful of diamond jewelry loaned by Harry
Winston.
</P>
<P>
   As always, event creator Lilly Tartikoff and her committee
organized a wonderful evening that ended with a pasta and lobster
feast prepared by Wolfgang Puck and served on white Versace china.
Major contributors for the evening were Neiman Marcus, Revlon,
Universal Studios and Versace.
</P>
<P>
   EARLIER IN THE WEEK, the Philharmonic Gala, another awesome tent
party, was held on the plaza of the downtown Music Center.
</P>
<P>
   A retirement tribute to Ernest Fleischmann, executive vice
president and managing director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic
since 1969, the gala began with a concert inside the Dorothy
Chandler Pavilion conducted by Zubin Mehta, featuring guest
appearances by opera singer Gundula Janowitz and cellist Mstislav
Rostropovich.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, we followed the red-carpet pathway into the tent that
award-winning event planner David Tutera turned into a lavish
European winter fantasy with huge rose-covered topiary trees,
festive garlands, a sky-high Christmas tree with ornaments the size
of beach balls, and wrought iron candelabras and colorful scarves
suspended from the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   The tables were covered in numerous layers of velvet and
decorated to the hilt with flowers and fruit, and each table had a
different theme with specially selected china, crystal and antique
silverware. We all had the same menu _ haricot vert salad, roasted
Chilean sea bass and chocolate tartufo _ provided by Andy Nakano of
Jozu restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Between dinner and dancing, I had a chance to chat with Rebecca
De Mornay, who was seated at my table. ``Wasn't the concert moving?
I had no idea I liked classical music so much,'' said the
Austrian-raised actress who became a household name after she
starred with Tom Cruise in ``Risky Business.'' Besides taking a new
interest in the symphony and opera, De Mornay said she's been busy
being mom to her 1-year-old daughter, Sofia, and making three
movies that will be released in '99.
</P>
<P>
   Applause for the wonderful gala goes to chairs Ken McCormick,
Ferne Margulies and Nancy Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   CHILDREN WERE THE STARS and recipients of all funds raised at
H.E.L.P. Group's Teddy Bear Ball at the Beverly Hills Hotel, where
guests didn't dance but stood in line to shake hands with
Gov.-elect Gray Davis, who was honored for his support of better
education programs.
</P>
<P>
   The evening started with an auction of some unusual items,
including a lunch with Dr. Ruth Westheimer, which went for $2,000;
and a real Faberge egg, which sold for $1,800. An international
treasure raising less than a date with a shrink? Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   The Cornish game hen dinner was served by candlelight, with many
guests oohing and aahing over the ambience. But Dyan Cannon
diverted everyone's attention, including the H.E.L.P. children
performing on stage, when she joined the kids to sing holiday songs
in a Santa's elf costume that revealed way too much thigh.
</P>
<P>
   In her defense, Dr. Ilene Bell, a psychologist with the Sherman
Oaks-based H.E.L.P. Group, said Cannon and other celebs graciously
give of their time to help emotionally troubled kids gain
self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   DIVINE DESIGN '98, a benefit for Project Angel Food and Design
Industries Foundation Fighting AIDS (DIFFA) took place as usual at
the Pacific Design Center, but the venue was the only thing
reminiscent of previous parties.
</P>
<P>
   There was no sit-down dinner, and with too few tables and chairs
to go around, most guests were forced to stand throughout the
entire evening to see L.A. designer Max Azria of BCBG honored as
Women's Designer of the Year. Azria, who attended with his wife,
Lubov, and children Joyce, Michael and Marine, was pleased to see
so many women wearing his label. Among them was ``Will and Grace''
star Debra Messing, who wore a stunning pale-gray gown and stole by
Azria.
</P>
<P>
   Also honored were Nick Graham, the outrageous designer of Joe
Boxer fashions, who wore a novelty print bathrobe; Harry and
Dorothy Lawenda of Kneedler-Fauchere Interior Design; and the
Kohler Co., best-known for bathroom fixtures.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Pleshette was the honorary chairwoman who helped get a
number of celebrities to present awards, including David Hyde
Pierce, who told me he is nothing like the character he plays on
``Frasier.'' Said Pierce, ``I don't usually dress up. I have one
fancy suit _ this Gucci one I'm wearing _ and no, my home doesn't
look like the mansion (on `Frasier'). I have dogs, so there's no
way I could have art objects.'' (Later, at the Fire &AMP; Ice Ball, he
pointed out that his Armani ensemble was a tuxedo, not a suit,
fancy or otherwise ...)
</P>
<P>
   Faith Ford, who doesn't usually do the public party scene, was
there, too. The star of the new sitcom ``Maggie Winters'' said
she's been supporting AIDS prevention programs for years and prays
there will be a cure in the coming year. She also talked about
personal style, commenting that her spaghetti-strapped black gown
was by David Cardona. ``As I get older, I get more classic in my
taste ... and besides, I kept the gown simple because I wanted to
wear diamonds,'' she quipped.

THE VILLAGE PEOPLE: TINY-TOWN COLLECTORS FUEL A BILLION-DOLLAR
BUSINESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A middle-aged woman proclaims Kensington
Palace the perfect piece to add to her Christmas village collection
this year, not because it was the home of Princess Di, but because
it reminds her of Fort Worth's Arlington Heights High School, from
which she graduated.
</P>
<P>
   A young child points out a house she says looks just like her
Grandma's house when her family arrives for Christmas each year _
with snow on the roof and lights and wreaths at the windows, and
Mom is hooked. She decides $65 is really not too much to pay for
the little ceramic building, after all.
</P>
<P>
   And, a 12-year-old argues that the New England Village's
Pigeonhead Lighthouse and Old North Church are just the stuff to
start her family's collection because her dad loves lighthouses and
she has just studied Paul Revere and his midnight ride _ plus the
village has its own boat, a porcelain sailing ship which the girl
insists ``is really awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   The little houses and figurines that began as coffee-table
decorations, set in nests of cotton and glitter, have taken over
entire rooms in many collectors' homes. Some of the more elaborate
collections now have not only their own boats, but also their own
trucks, trains and motorcycles, ice palaces, Italian-style carved
marble fountains that spout real water and McDonald's hamburger
joints.
</P>
<P>
   This rampant building has snowballed Christmas collectibles into
a billion-dollar-a-year business.
</P>
<P>
   Nostalgia, family traditions, cultural heritage, emotional and
spiritual values all fuel the desire to acquire Christmas
collectibles, now the fastest-growing segment of the huge Christmas
decorating market.
</P>
<P>
   Individual collectors, estimated to number over 10 million in
the United States, spend more on the little town of Bethlehem and
the North Pole village than is spent on trees, Santas, decorations
and indoor and outdoor lights. In 1996, expenditures for all
Christmas decorations totaled $4.3 billion in consumer sales _ up
13 percent over the previous year, says Pam Danziger, president of
Unity Marketing and author of a new market research study,
``Collecting Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 collectible ornaments, figurines and villages comprised
about one-fourth of the market with $1.1 billion in sales _ an
increase of 21 percent over the 1995 figures.
</P>
<P>
   The billion-dollar business is built on foggy memories of
storybook realities. ``It takes you back to simpler times _ when
life was more gentle and people were happy. It's very
heartwarming,'' explains Carol Taylor, an avid collector.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to come home from work, turn the house lights down
low, turn on all the village lights and sit there looking at it, so
peaceful and calm,'' says Taylor, who works at Lockheed Martin. She
often plays Christmas carols while keeping watch over her village.
</P>
<P>
   The happy little table towns have become a visual Prozac. ``You
don't find very many negative things included in the villages. A
couple of years ago, they introduced a cemetery, and there was a
huge commotion about it over the Internet. People were really
upset. The same thing happened when someone suggested a funeral
procession. It's too down beat,'' Taylor recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy also arose when the minuscule lobsters included in
the ``Lobster Trappers'' accessory turned out to be red. Purists
from all over the country dialed into the Internet to complain that
lobsters turn red only after they are cooked, recalls Taylor with a
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   She is an eclectic collector who takes liberties with the world
she commands. She once added a tiny aquarium with real live fish to
one of her village scenes. In recent years, she dropped in a
``flasher'' in a yellow raincoat and invited guests to ``find
Waldo.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   One year, Taylor fashioned King Kong climbing up and over the
City Globe newspaper office of her Christmas in the City, with
photographers shooting pictures, and a mother holding her young son
with one hand and pointing with the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes a village come to life are the special things you
do to it, how you set it up and the accessories you put into it. I
have fun talking to other people and giving them ideas for unusual
ways to display their scenes,'' Taylor notes.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Gordon, of Fort Worth, purchased her first houses from the
Original Snow Village collection 10 years ago when a shop in Las
Colinas was going out of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I'm hooked,'' she admits. ``I can't even display all of
my collection at one time.''
</P>
<P>
   The collection includes 156 lighted houses. Her trees alone fill
six or eight packing cases. She says a village can't have too many
trees.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, a retired nuclear engineer, has always been fascinated
by detailed miniatures, partly explaining her enthusiastic response
to Department 56, a gift-ware manufacturer that makes seven of the
most popular collections: the Original Snow Village, Dickens
Village, New England Village, Alpine Village, Christmas in the
City, North Pole and Little Town of Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many hobby shops, nurseries, building-supply stores
and department stores _ including Mervyn's, Wal-Mart, Kmart, JoAnn
Fabrics and Crafts, and MJDesigns _ have their own special
villages, as do many mail-order Christmas catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   Prices range from a couple of dollars for less detailed ceramic
houses to $175 for Department 56's historical reproduction of
Shakespeare's Old Globe Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   The Christmas Carol Cottage introduced in the Dickens Village in
1997 features curling wisps of ``magic smoke'' drifting from its
stone chimney for $60, and Mrs. Claus' Greenhouse from the popular
North Pole series is filled with red poinsettias ($68).
</P>
<P>
   ``Some collectors know every detail and wouldn't think of mixing
their village pieces, while others mix and match what they like
best from different collections,'' says Lea Anne Seeley, a
collector and co-owner of Tis the Season Christmas stores in Fort
Worth and Arlington, where Christmas village houses and accessories
are hot items.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like an adult version of collecting doll-house miniatures
or train sets,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon says a combination of nostalgia and some sort of personal
identification with one or more of the individual shops and houses
keeps a lot of collectors hooked.
</P>
<P>
   For example, lawyers might look for courthouses for their
collections and physicians for doctors' offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the fun is in the hunt,'' Gordon says.
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of different trees, wreaths, hedges, fences,
walls, bridges, walkways, street lights, mountains and other
``official accessories'' _ including strings of tiny colored lights
to decorate the trees and ``Brite Lite'' decorations to deck out
the yards _ in addition to personal ``finds'' added by individual
collectors and built by entrepreneurs who specialize in mountains,
lakes, waterfalls and other special touches.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, like many other collectors, has constructed some of her
own details, such as a clothesline with tiny dolls' clothes hung by
even tinier clothespins.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband learned how to make special effects at the
weekly meetings of the Cowtown Villagers, a group of about 100
Tarrant County collectors who meet the first Tuesday of each month
at Tis the Season in far west Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   The group invites speakers to demonstrate nature building, such
as adding rivers and waterfalls to their layouts, how best to cut
and shape plastic foam and how to achieve natural-looking snow.
</P>
<P>
   The collectors sell and trade houses and accessories, discuss
novel ways to display their villages and sponsor a tour of members'
homes each December to show off. They also participate in the Texas
Roundup, a state-wide convention that attracts about 1,000 village
collectors each year. It is one of more than 20 major
Christmas-village conventions held throughout the country. In
addition, at least three quarterly magazines cater to Christmas
collectors.
</P>
<P>
   A Department 56 spokesman said the company hears from village
collectors all over the world, but so far most are confined to the
United States and Canada. The village rage has not gone global,
yet.

</P>
<P>
   GUGGENHEIM (New York) _ If anyone could have made sense of the
doings at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum last Thursday, it was
Eve, the top half of Brancusi's wooden sculpture ``Adam and Eve.''
With African features, a Hebrew name and a French-Romanian creator,
she touched more cultural bases than a Benetton advertisement. What
better emblem for the museum's new exhibition, ``Rendezvous:
Masterpieces from the Centre Georges Pompidou and the Guggenheim
Museums,'' and for a fizzy panel discussion dedicated to the
proposition that art, design, fashion, television and everything
else were converging into one huge fabulous cultural goo ball. By
William Grimes.
</P>
<P>
   HOLIDAY-CARDS (Undated) _ As if it's not stressful enough that
people are judged by their looks, their jobs, their addresses and
even where their children go to school, with the holidays
approaching there is one more item to add to the list: Christmas
and Chanukah cards. By Monique P. Yazigi.
</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ December and January belong to
evergreens and berried branches, to sprays of laurel and magnolia
leaves where those plants can be grown, and to bowls of colorful
fruit. By Cass Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   HOT-TICKETS (Undated) _ When Ticketmaster offered me the choice
between a good seat in January and a lousy one in early December to
the hottest play in town, I chose the lousy one, just to be ahead
of the curve. And so, with some chagrin, I arrived last Saturday
night for a sold-out preview at the Cort Theater with binoculars in
my coat pocket. Not that having binoculars in a theater was so bad.
But since I was seeing ``The Blue Room,'' I felt sheepish. ``The
Blue Room,'' after all, stars Nicole Kidman and is about sex and
only sex. By Bob Morris.
</P>
<P>
   CHARITY-AUCTIONS (Undated) _ Whether it means putting on a
Speedo for ``Baywatch'' or lying there like a corpse for ``General
Hospital,'' a cameo television appearance is just one of the
fantasy moments now tempting bidders at charity auctions. By Ellen
Gamerman.

THUMBS UP FOR THE NEW MERCEDES M CLASS SUV 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)  
 (For release Sunday, December 13, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R.WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in September, we introduced readers to the new high-powered
version of the Mercedes-Benz M Class
sport/utility/van/whatevermobile, the ML430 with its brand new
268-horsepower V-8 engine. Back then, the columnist had been
favorably impressed by the quickness, agility, and go-anywhere
ability of this new Benz. (Well, go almost anywhere; it won't swim,
it won't fly, and it does not leap tall buildings at a single
bound.) But the proof of a car is living with it over the long
term.
</P>
<P>
   The 4.3-liter V-8 in the 430 will take you from 0 to 60 in a
smidgen more than six seconds _ this is extreme acceleration
potential in a utility package. The price of performance, as we all
know, is fuel appetite. With that performance, there is the
off-road capability of the ML430; it is full-time 4-wheel drive
with a two-speed electronic transfer case for low-range operation
in the muck and mire, sand and snow. As we all know, 4-wheel-drive
off-roaders gobble gas. The ML430 would appear to be twice damned
here _ a plow horse built for speed eats like a lot of horse.
</P>
<P>
   And there is the room and luxury appointments. This is a fairly
large, roomy vehicle _ 4,552 pounds curbside with a 5,000-pound tow
capacity. Not much hope for economy here.
</P>
<P>
   It is, however, EPA rated at 15 miles per gallon city, 18
highway, quite respectable for an SUV of any capacity and better by
some than a few high-priced SUVs that don't do nearly as much
nearly as well. Still, you might be willing to sacrifice the
performance and settle for the 215-hp V-6-powered sibling ML320,
EPA rated 17/21 _ and less money in the bargain.
</P>
<P>
   But the test is living with it, feeding it, driving it over the
long term. OK, we've tested. It's still a winner. And it would seem
that the EPA has missed something here. If you take the city number
and the highway number, somewhere in between is the real everyday
number, the so-called combined average. Almost never in real life
does one actually get that highway number _ except maybe when the
EPA is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Your columnist kept track for 900.7 miles; the ML430 delivered
18.66 miles per gallon over the measured distance. Part of that
mileage was a section of high-speed highway driving with the
five-speed automatic transmission accidentally locked out of
overdrive (driver error), and part of the time was with a moderate
load. A good part of the driving was the around-town sort, and the
routes covered a variety of terrain, everything from the
ramp-of-the-week in the muddle?? of Boston's Big Dig to dirt road
and a wee bit of snow. The ML430 delivered a measured 18.66 miles
per gallon, more than the estimated highway average.
</P>
<P>
   For laughs, I measured one more tankful: 18.68. The beast is
consistent.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is price. The base ML430 is $43,750 plus $595
delivery _ the 320 is $34,950. The tested ML430 had a few extras
that brought the total delivered price to $48,085, about 2 1/2
times what I once paid for a house. The extras included tubular
chrome side runners and brush guard; the side runners look like
fancy exhaust pipes but really serve as a running board. The brush
guard reminds me of a chrome footboard on a single bed. That
package includes mud flaps for $1,595. Also extra were a Bose
premier audio system with a CD changer ($1,050), and a glass
sunroof ($1,095).
</P>
<P>
   Aren't all sunroofs glass? you ask. Not with the ML430. For a
mere $2,395 extra, you may forgo the glass option and get a
sectional metal roof that slides open and stacks the sections like
venetian blinds to offer a roof hole ranging in size from a
generous slit to a full three-foot by four-foot hole. With that,
however, it would probably be wise to avoid loading anything on the
roof, rack or no.
</P>
<P>
   If you opt for the standard model, you do not come away
ill-equipped; the ML430 offers a lengthy array of standard
equipment, including a few items besides the V-8 that you won't get
standard on the less expensive 320 _ trip computer, rear privacy
glass, heated seats, a lockable storage drawer under the front
passenger seat, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the standard technology that impresses. In addition to
front and side air bags, the M series offers the Benz Electronic
Stability Program as standard equipment and the new emergency brake
assist system. The ESP senses yaw _ imminent slip _ and corrects
instantly. The emergency brake assist senses panic stops and
immediately applies maximum brake pedal pressure whether the driver
is able to or not. Antilock brakes are standard and the
4-wheel-drive system employed relies on electronically controlled
traction assist rather than locking differentials _ if you can get
traction on one wheel, you can keep the ML moving. The five-speed
tranmission is electronically managed, too, adapts to the
individual's driving style, and resists sudden shift changes as
grades change.
</P>
<P>
   The only real problem with a car so equipped is driver
overconfidence; no electronic system can compensate effectively for
recklessness.
</P>
<P>
   Off road, the 430 is gentler than a standard 4 x 4 truck; on
road it is stiffer than a standard luxury sedan. Handling is very
precise. The ride is very comfortable, more carlike than SUV-ish.
Visibility is quite good, although you are not as high off the
pavement as in traditional SUVs; the step-up height is more akin to
a sedan than a truck, so most people could well afford to skip the
fancy side runners. The bumpers, too, match sedan height, something
neighbors in sedans might appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   Interior storage is pretty good _ that drawer, door bins, and
various other bins offer storage room. There are no seat pockets;
the backs are scooped a bit to offer kneeroom, which is ample.
Headroom, too, is abundant.
</P>
<P>
   Benz has succumbed to the cupholder demands of Americans and has
come up with what has to be the most elegant design in the front of
the vehicle. At either end of the dash, one presses, and a polished
cupholder unfolds from its hiding place, folds back up at a touch _
so don't bump it with your knee while there's a beverage in there,
lest you wind up wearing some of it. A couple of cupholders fold
out from the center console for the rear passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The rear seat, by the way, is split three ways, folds down,
folds forward for more cargo space.
</P>
<P>
   The dash in the ML is different from that in other Mercedes
models, especially the radio controls, which are much more
convenient in the ML than in other Mercedeses _ but I wish Benz
would join in the common labeling practices. I prefer separate
selectors for AM, FM, CD, not the single button labeled ``mode.''
There is where multiplicity is simplicity _ you select what you
want rather than going through a whole cycle by strumming the
``mode'' button. Hey, I have to find something to complain about,
otherwise you might not take me seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Thumbs up, even if I can't afford one.

SEEING OPPORTUNITY AS OTHERS ARE FLEEING  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 13) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a year filled with defaults, devaluations and downturns
bordering on depressions, emerging markets may win the prize as the
Discredited Asset Class of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Through Dec. 10, the average emerging-markets fund has declined
more than 27 percent, according to Lipper Inc. And money is flowing
out of such funds: $810 million this year through Oct. 31, Lipper
says.
</P>
<P>
   Tough times. But opportunity often arises out of adversity.
</P>
<P>
   One person with that opinion is J. Mark Mobius, the
globe-trotting manager of eight Franklin/Templeton emerging-markets
funds. Mobius took some time during a stop last week in Santiago,
Chile, to talk about investing's new outcasts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)It's been more than a year since the onset of the
Asian crisis began to shake emerging markets, and lots of investors
have left. Who are the buyers?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. At this stage, some people who have been badly burned are
saying they will never again be in emerging markets, and have
bailed out. But there are three types of investors who are
competing for assets.
</P>
<P>
   First there are portfolio investors like us, who are in for the
long haul and whose clients have not abandoned them.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also strategic investors, like the GE's or
Coca-Cola's, who are picking up listed companies for a song.
</P>
<P>
   And there are private equity investors who are also picking up
bargains in listed and unlisted companies.
</P>
<P>
   So there is competition for assets in these countries. While it
may not be so evident in price movements, as more money comes in, I
think prices will rise rather dramatically. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Can you give us some examples?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. In Argentina, a company called Bunge &AMP; Born owns a
controlling interest in a packaged- and canned-goods company called
Molinos. We happen to be an 11 percent holder of Molinos, which
Bunge &AMP; Born wants to sell. Whoever buys control could easily say
they are delisting this company.
</P>
<P>
   Another example is a South African company called Angen,
formerly owned by Mobil. Mobil sold out at very low prices because
of apartheid. About a year ago, Petronas, the Malaysian oil
company, bought about 30 percent of the shares and made an offer to
buy all the shares at double the market price. Everyone but us
jumped at it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)How long will it take to rebound?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think it will take more than a year. The obvious
place it will happen first is Asia. A lot of people are searching
for assets there, because they are cheap. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)But can Asia start to grow without a healthy
Japan?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. As long as the United States economy continues to expand,
Asia can grow without Japan. If the American economy goes in the
tank, recovery in Asia will be slower. But Japan is not vital to
the growth of Asia. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)You sound more optimistic now about these markets
than you did when we last talked, in September 1997. Is that
so?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I am more optimistic now, because back then there was so much
uncertainty. Now we are in a situation where you could get some
explosive upside movement. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Where are you invested?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, for the first time in years we are almost 100 percent
invested. About 35 percent of the money is in Latin America, a
little less in Asia. The rest is in South Africa, Eastern Europe,
places like that. Our biggest countries are Brazil, Mexico and
Argentina, each with between 8 percent and 10 percent of assets. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)A year ago you voiced concern that the Malaysian
government's decision to impose controls on capital flows would
spread through Asia. Is that still a worry?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. We were quite depressed when they announced capital controls,
and we were afraid that policy would spread to other countries. But
I am happy to report the Malaysians are having second thoughts
about that policy. They are beginning to ask for meetings to talk
about changes, because I think they realize they are being cut off
from tremendous flows of capital. But even if they do alter that
position, the issue of crony capitalism is still there. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Has the past year prompted other changes that are
important to investors?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. A couple come immediately to mind.
</P>
<P>
   Many markets that have been illiquid and had restrictive
regulations on stock ownership, as in Chile, have listed the assets
in New York and London. That has created more liquidity.
</P>
<P>
   Minority shareholder rights is another important area. One of
the reasons a lot of people were disillusioned about these markets
is that shareholders really had no rights. But a number of
countries, including Chile, are now talking about equal economic
rights of shareholders. That is not a revolutionary idea to us, but
it is to them.

TEA PARTY ISSUES STILL ALIVE TODAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KENNEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Officially, it's the 225th anniversary of the Boston
Tea Party _ something of a caper amid the momentous events leading
to the American Revolution _ but there will be a bit of family
history and a burst of 1990s politics in the air at Sunday's
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The historic events _ a protest meeting at the Old South Meeting
House followed by the dumping of chests of tea into Boston Harbor,
took place on the evening of Dec. 16, 1773. They were a protest
against a tax on tea imported from England, even though the tax
lowered the price for which the tea was sold in the colonies.
</P>
<P>
   This year the 1773 unrest will be celebrated Sunday beginning at
5:30 p.m. with a reenactment of the protest meeting, followed by a
march down to the replica Tea Party Ship on the Congress Street
bridge. The events are free, and doors at the meeting house will
open at 4:45 p.m. when Ayriel, a historical-music group, will sing
patriotic and tavern songs of the period.
</P>
<P>
   The bit of family history will be supplied by Charles Chauncey
Wells, a descendent of one of the participants in the Tea Party,
while John Vann, who will portray Samuel Adams in the reenactment,
will supply the burst of 1990s politics.
</P>
<P>
   Wells is a ``four-greats'' grandson of Thomas Wells, a
blacksmith who worked on the harbor's wharves. Handed down in the
Wells family is a wrapper from one of the tea chests, which the
protester took and tucked in his shirt. ``They had been told not to
do that,'' Wells said, ``but they were all pretty lively young
men.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells is a former Chicago newsman, and his interest in his
ancestor prompted him to research and write a guide to Copps Hill
Burying Ground in the North End, where his ancestor and 28 other
Tea Party participants are buried. He will sign copies of his book
at the meeting house Saturday from noon to 2.
</P>
<P>
   Vann, a former Boston radio and television reporter who lives in
Arlington, will portray Adams, who fired up the citizens inside the
meeting house, sending them into the streets with his rallying cry
of ``this meeting can do nothing more to save the country.''

   Waiting outside was a crew of young artisans and tradesmen like
Thomas Wells, thinly disguised as ``Indians,'' a group that Adams
had organized to be ready to lead a march to Griffin's Wharf
(located midway between Congress Street and Northern Avenue on
Atlantic Avenue) where the tea ships were docked.
</P>
<P>
   Adams was ``the agitator and the director who made things
happen,'' said Vann. ``He had a good way of getting a crowd flipped
up and excited.'' For himself, said Vann, he will get the audience
at Sunday's reenactment excited ``by the use of my voice and
personality.''
</P>
<P>
   And, to add the note of 1990s politics, ``I'll be bringing up
the matter of taxes. There are certain hot buttons you can push
that work as well today as they did 225 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   However staged the Boston Tea Party may have been as an act of
political protest, it triggered a similar event three days later in
Marshfield. Marshfield was ``a Tory town,'' according to town
historian Cynthia Hagar Krusell, but there were a number of young
men and small farmers who were patriots and were ``emboldened'' by
the events in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   At midnight on Dec. 19, they broke into John Bourne's store
(still standing off Route 3A) and seized the boxes of tea they
found. They loaded them on an ox cart and hauled them to the top of
a nearby hill and burned them on a large flat rock. As of Friday,
no commemoration was planned, but the rock is still known as Tea
Rock, sitting atop Tea Rock Hill, across from Town Hall.

FORGET THE PET; BUY YOUR ANIMAL LOVER A BOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VICKI CROKE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   All the animal experts say that buying a pet for someone else
during the holidays is a potential disaster. Choosing a puppy or
kitten is very much like falling in love _ it's something no friend
or family member, no matter how well-meaning, can do for us. And
because the holidays are so chaotic, it's tough to give a new pet
the attention required.
</P>
<P>
   But fear not. You can place something with a spine under the
tree. Animal lovers also tend to be voracious readers, and there
are plenty of new book titles to satisfy them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Red-Tails in Love: A Wildlife Drama in Central Park''
(Pantheon Books, $24) is one of the most enchanting true nature
stories ever. Wall Street Journal writer Marie Winn falls in with
an eclectic group of New York City birders, the ``regulars,'' as
she follows the saga of a red-tail hawk, Pale Male, through five
years of drama, tragedy, and joy. Fighting against forces of nature
and man, Pale Male struggles to raise a family on an upscale
apartment building in the heart of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Though evocative of classic nature stories, ``Red-Tails in
Love'' is thoroughly modern and gives cameos to Woody Allen, Mary
Tyler Moore, and Glenn Close. The real stars are the dear and
quirky regulars and, of course, the birds themselves. That people
can feel so much a part of the natural world and its rhythms even
in the heart of frantic New York is a wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best animal books lately have come from scientists
who, after years of studying a subject, ask profound questions
about the relationship between humans and other animals. ``Silent
Thunder: In the Presence of Elephants'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25), by
Katy Payne, is the story of two journeys. One is an action-packed
scientific safari, in which acoustic biologist Payne discovers and
explores communication among elephants, which is carried on at
frequencies far below the detection of human ears. And the other is
a spiritual one in which Payne compellingly weaves together her
farmland upbringing, a Quaker sensibility, the philosophy of the
Shona people she works with in Africa, and her own moral leanings
to form a philosophy of wise conservation. The interconnectedness
of life is a matter for the soul and the environment, Payne shows
us through her rich memories of elephants and people.
</P>
<P>
   Not all animal books have to be dramatic to be good. John
Pukite's ``A Field Guide to Cows: How to Identify and Appreciate
America's 52 Breeds'' (Penguin, $11.95) won't give you a lot to
ruminate about, but it is good, clean fun. The cow facts, both
serious and silly, pile up faster than pies in the pasture in this
easy-to-use guide. (Dairy cows are wedge-shaped, beef cows are more
rectangular; the Watusi from Africa has longer horns than the Texas
Longhorn; the Limousin from France may very well be the cow
depicted in the famed Lascaux cave drawings.) And the breed
information is accurate and concise.
</P>
<P>
   It's more Reader's Digest than New Yorker, and the title is
almost longer than the book itself. But Ruth Hanessian's ``Birds on
the Couch: The Bird Shrink's Guide to Keeping Polly from Going
Crackers and You out of the Cuckoo's Nest'' (Crown, $17) is a fun,
breezy read. The book, written with Wendy Bounds, has tiny
subchapters such as ``Why the Caged Bird Balks'' and ``Egging Polly
On'' that reveal the complicated psychology and biology of pet
birds through colorful little anecdotes from a woman who has been
part of the bird world since 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Curtis, once a dealer in nature books, now has his own
imprint specializing in field guides. The latest, ``Field Guide to
the Larger Mammals of Africa'' (Ralph Curtis Books, $32.95), by
Chris and Tilde Stuart, is handsome and easy to use. Large color
photos, and a layout that includes range maps, plates, and size
scale with descriptions, make it user-friendly. The Stuarts come
with impressive credentials, and their text is authoritative and
concise. (Other guides under the same imprint bring you birds and
snakes from Australia, Borneo, India, and Africa.) . . . ``The
Mythology of Dogs: Canine Legend and Lore Through the Ages'' (St.
Martin's Press, $12.95), by Gerald and Loretta Hausman, is now in
paperback. From basset hounds in Shakespeare to wolfhounds in
ancient Rome, to the celestial leanings of the dachshund in
Egyptian mythology, this book compiles breed-by-breed information
from religious texts, literature, mythology, and pop culture that
you won't find in other dog books. . . . The design of porcupine
quills allows them to move into the victim's flesh at a rate of
about half an inch a day. That was discovered by a curious (in all
senses of the word) researcher who studied the phenomenon while an
embedded quill traveled from one side of his own calf and out the
other. Sloths do everything slowly _ they only urinate and defecate
every eight days. These facts are part of the collection ``Every
Creeping Thing: True Tales of Faintly Repulsive Wildlife'' (Henry
Holt &AMP; Co., $25), by Richard Conniff. Traveling widely, Conniff
provides the inside story on rats, grizzlies, sharks, cormorants,
and more.

 &HT;    PALESTINIANS HOPEFUL, ISRAELIS ANXIOUS ON VERGE OF CLINTON TRIP
 &HT;    With MIDEAST, MIDEAST-SITES and MIDEAST-SECURITY
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service(at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMALLAH, West Bank Palestinian Imad Rabah's small factory had
just stamped out 14,000 plastic flags to help welcome President
Clinton, but he still did a double take at the sight of his
three-year-old son waving one in the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe, two years ago, I wouldn't have let him show that,'' he
said. ``It would make people angry.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabah attended the University of Florida, but he knows that you
don't often see Old Glory in a Palestinian street unless it's in
flames.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton arrives in Israel Saturday night, he will face a
visit hosted by two peoples Palestinian and Israeli with widely
different views of his mission and jealous of his attention.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Palestinians are gleeful at the first visit from the
leader of an America they think has neglected their plight. They
will get to host him in Gaza and Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis, especially their leaders, are nervous that their
stalwart American ally is cozying up to their old enemy.
</P>
<P>
   From his 10th floor hotel penthouse, Clinton will be able to
view the pricey condominiums of Jewish Jerusalem and the walls of
the ancient Old City, populated mostly by Arabs who consider
themselves under Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Out there, the Wye River Plantation peace plan, which Clinton
brokered six weeks ago, is frozen. Even Friday, on the even of
Clinton's trip, two Palestinians died when Israeli troops fired at
hundreds of stone-throwers in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   America has become more involved in the process than ever, and
the question is whether the two sides will get enough from
Clinton's trip to start making concessions needed to get it back on
track.
</P>
<P>
   For the Palestinians it could be easy. Clinton's side trip
Monday to the Gaza Strip looks to them like a step toward their
dream of an independent nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember that President Clinton has a custom of
visiting autonomous areas,''' quipped Ahmed Tibi, aide to
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the poorly-concealed sentiments among Israeli leaders
might best be summed up with an Arabic proverb: You invite your
friend, and he brings his donkey, too. The trip has taken an
unexpected turn.
</P>
<P>
   At the Wye River Plantation in Maryland, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu was eager for Clinton to go to Gaza. He thought it would
force the PLO to meet and reaffirm that it no longer seeks the
destruction of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``But (the Palestinians) reversed it,'' Natan Sharansky, who
helped negotiate Wye for the Israelis, said with some
consternation. ``(Now), it's a reception honoring Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Israelis tend to see Clinton two ways. Left-wing Israelis admire
him perhaps more than any other U.S. president. Many have Hebrew
bumper stickers quoting, ``Peace, friend,'' from the eulogy Clinton
delivered at the 1995 funeral of slain Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   But, the Israeli right wing, which currently holds power, sees
Clinton as pressuring Israel to give up land. New posters in
Jerusalem show an illustration of Clinton in an Arab head dress,
telling him ``Go Home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Israeli public is pretty tired and pretty confused,'' said
Joseph Alpher, director of the Middle East office of the American
Jewish Committee.
</P>
<P>
   They will get one day with Clinton to themselves, then he heads
to Gaza for a day. Members of Netanyahu's cabinet even suggested
that Clinton be asked not to come at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Left-wing Israelis will applaud it and right wing Israelis
will be appalled,'' Alpher said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has agreed not to fly to Gaza in his Boeing 747 Air
Force One. It was, for the Israelis, too potent a symbol of
official America. He will take his helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   But, beyond all the symbolism, Israelis worry Clinton will try
to revive Wye by letting Arafat slide on promises to fight
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important the president makes it clear that he has no
intention of trying to deliver Israel on issues that go to the
heart of Israel's security,'' Israeli government spokesman Moshe
Fogel said.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate concern is the Gaza meeting. The Palestinians are
sticking to the letter of the Wye agreement, which lets them
vaguely ``reaffirm'' that they have amended their national charter
to no longer call for war against Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Israel demands a clear, public, vote. Palestinians say they
amended their charter once in 1996 and do not need to vote again.
</P>
<P>
   It will create a tough situation for Netanyahu if Clinton gives
the thumbs up to what he will see in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants the peace process to continue, but members of
Netanyahu's right-wing coalition threaten to dump him if he accepts
anything less than an explicit vote before resuming the land
transfers scheduled in the Wye plan.
</P>
<P>
   As Israeli columnist Hemi(cq) Shalev wrote Friday, ``The
equation is fundamentally simple: Clinton and Netanyahu have
conflicting interests. The victories of the one will come, by
necessity, at the expense of the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the forays into Palestinian territories, Netanyahu will
get the last word. On Clinton's final stop Tuesday, Netanyahu will
personally guide him through the mountaintop archaeological site at
Masada, where Jewish rebels 1900 years ago committed suicide rather
than be routed by the Romans.

CALIFORNIA'S ETHNIC SHIFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ All afternoon, mariachi music filled the rotunda,
echoing up the 210-foot dome of the Capitol. After Speaker Antonio
Villaraigosa swore in new members of the Assembly, the fiesta
began.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1999-2000 session of the California Legislature, 24
Latinos will help make laws in the nation's largest state. The
seven senators and 17 assembly members add up to a record number,
but this triumph is not bipartisan. Among legislators of Hispanic
descent, Democrats outnumber Republicans, 20-4.
</P>
<P>
   For the GOP, this sour note is minor compared to the ominous
figures hurtling like a meteor toward a dwindling Republican base.
Demographers in the Department of Finance are finishing a survey
that shows the future arriving more suddenly than previously
thought. In 2001, California will have a nonwhite majority, with
blacks and whites declining slightly in their proportions, but
Asian-Americans and Latinos rising dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   By 2040, the Anglo-Hispanic ratio will be almost reversed. In
the 1990 Census, 57 percent of California's population was white
and 26 percent Hispanic. In 2040, demographers expect 60 million
people to inhabit California. By then, whites will have shrunk to
31 percent of the population and Hispanics will have grown to 48
percent.
</P>
<P>
   When Gray Davis, a Democrat, takes the oath as governor next
month, Democrats will dominate the political establishment of
California as rarely before. Only two Republicans, Secretary of
State Bill Jones and Insurance Commissioner Charles Quackenbush,
were reelected. Democrats also picked up more legislative seats.
</P>
<P>
   The lieutenant governor, elected separately, is Cruz Bustamante
of Fresno, a former Assembly speaker, whose presence on the ticket
aided Davis and other statewide candidates by energizing the
Hispanic vote. But the most potent sparkplug was a Republican,
Governor Pete Wilson, now leaving office after two terms. Although
he can count some successes in the economy, education, and the
environment, Wilson's legacy does not include warm relations
between whites and Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, his reelection endangered, Wilson adopted Proposition
187, which sought to ban state services for illegal immigrants.
Although Wilson carefully made distinctions between legal and
illegal immigrants, television ads did not, depicting shadowy mass
border crossings in a grainy Willie Horton monochrome with the tag
line, ``They keep coming.''
</P>
<P>
   In elections since, Hispanics have said to Republicans: ``What
do you mean `They,' Gringo?''
</P>
<P>
   ``They'' has become ``Us'' in California, endangering a party
that often caters to rich white males, thus part of Wilson's
legacy. At a ``roast'' for the outgoing governor last week, the
Sacramento Press Club disproved the notion that California politics
is all mellow bliss. The viejo gringo gave as good as he got, but
even the dinner program mocked his ambitions, reproducing a highway
warning sign, a silhouetted family scampering across the Mexican
border. The captions read: ``Pedro in 2000'' and ``Run, Pete,
Run!''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's friend, longtime Republican strategist Ken Khachigian,
sees bright moments in the future. ``When Latinos become homeowners
and taxpayers, they'll become concerned about taxes, just as they
are already about crime and discipline in the schools,'' he says.
``Basically, we just to have to be patient while demographics
change not just ethnically, but economically. Hispanics will
discover that Democrats believe in higher taxes, less discipline,
and are less interested in family values.''
</P>
<P>
   His patience may not be shared by Hispanic families, only 40
percent of whom now own their own homes, a Census figure trailing
black home ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Khachigian's optimism also ignores what a Democratic party icon,
John Maynard Keynes, wrote in ``A Tract on Monetary Reform'' in
1923: ``This long run is a misleading guide to public affairs. In
the long run, we are all dead.''

TWO BIOGRAPHIES THAT ENTERTAIN AND INFORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN KOCH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
INTIMATE PORTRAIT: CHRISTINE LAHTI
<TEXT>
<P>
   Produced by: Valerie Shepherd
</P>
<P>
   Directed by: Lee Grant
</P>
<P>
   On: Lifetime, Saturday at 10 p.m.
</P>

   &QL; 
MONTGOMERY CLIFT: THE HIDDEN STAR
</P>
<P>
   Produced and written by: John Griffin
</P>
<P>
   On: A&AMP;E, Monday at 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just because a biography is friendly to its subject, more
approving than probing, doesn't mean it has to be dull or
uninformative. Virtually all of today's stream of made-for-cable
celebrity portraits, like Lifetime's upcoming hour about actress
Christine Lahti and A &AMP; E's biography of legendary movie star
Montgomery Clift, are soft tributes rather than serious studies.
</P>
<P>
   But, like the Clift documentary, they can be moving and
interesting, even if, at 60 minutes, necessarily incomplete. More
about this relatively pleasing production later.
</P>
<P>
   First, let's dispense with ``Christine Lahti,'' one of the
Lifetime channel's so-called Intimate Portraits (debuting Saturday
at 10 p.m.). Don't get me wrong: I admire Lahti's edgy acting style
and mildly eccentric persona; and, for what it's worth, I suspect
she's a perfectly decent human being. But I expect more from even
such a casual, upbeat profile than the statement that Lahti comes
from a ``picture-perfect family.'' Any biography employing those
three words is sure to be a lie and, worse, a bore.
</P>
<P>
   And ``Lahti'' is indeed a bore, primarily an interview with the
49-year-old actress herself, chatting about her idyllic girlhood in
Michigan; her pal Goldie Hawn; her perfect husband, the director
Thomas Schlamme; and the joy she takes in work and motherhood. We
see Lahti as doting working mom on the set of ``Chicago Hope,''
taking a break to amuse her young children: She's cheerful,
unflappable and, frankly, unbelievable. Interspersed throughout the
interview are short on-camera comments from _ surprise _ Hawn,
Schlamme, and other complimentary friends and co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   I liked the fact that when she first waitressed and studied
acting in New York, the sheltered Lahti was afraid to go out after
9 p.m. But what remains is totally predictable, and the too-few,
too-short film clips fail to establish what's genuinely intriguing
about this woman _ her singularly stylish acting.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery Clift's was decidedly not a picture-perfect family,
and ``Montgomery Clift: The Hidden Star'' sketches his uneasy
childhood and sometimes tortured adult life in deft strokes. The A
&AMP; E biography airs Monday at 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Clift, of course, was a major screen figure and a powerful
influence on other actors, notably James Dean and Marlon Brando. In
``Red River'' and, later, ``A Place in the Sun,'' he broke the
Hollywood leading-man mold with his brooding intensity and palpable
vulnerability. Brando considered Clift a better actor, and never
felt he equaled him. Although this last fact isn't included in
``The Hidden Star,'' interesting details abound.
</P>
<P>
   Of particular interest are tape recordings made by Clift's
brother Brooks including converations with Montgomery and with
their domineering mother. Why Brooks made the recordings of his
brother isn't explained, but they reveal a man whose reedy, needy
voice seems to mirror his fabled anguish. Montgomery had apparently
always abused alcohol and drugs, but after a disfiguring 1956 auto
accident, his drinking and pill-popping worsened, certainly
contributing to his death in 1966 at 45.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was hushed up during his heyday by nervous movie
studios, Clift was gay or, depending on the source, bisexual. When
he was shooting ``A Place in the Sun'' with then 18-year-old
Elizabeth Taylor and was linked with her romantically by the
tabloids, she was getting him dates with other men. Much has been
made of the fact that Clift's sexual identity tortured him, but
Brooks Clift, a chief interview subject in ``The Hidden Star,''
argues otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is no denying that the popular actor was a
complicated and troubled man. It didn't help that he was so choosy
about scripts, offered to him in great profusion, that he turned
down starring roles in ``On the Waterfront'' and ``Sunset
Boulevard.''
</P>
<P>
   The A &AMP; E biography evokes a sympathetic picture of this
handsome, gifted, beloved, and sadly bedevilled screen icon.
</P>
<P>
   What it unfortunately fails to do is firmly establish, or even
precisely describe, the unique qualities of his subtly dynamic
acting. As in the Lahti program, too little time is devoted to
clips from the subject's movies. Nor are there any interviews with
film historians or critics that might have enriched our
appreciation of Clift's indelible and influential art.

   -- LATOURETTE-IMPEACHMENT. A statement circulated this week by a
conservative Lake County group claims Rep. Steven C. LaTourette,
R-Madison Village, is ``most likely'' among Republicans to vote
against the impeachment inquiry. The statement sparked angry calls
to LaTourette's Painesville office, but the congressman believes
the calls are unwarranted because he is waiting to see what the
House Judiciary Committee votes out before he makes up his mind.

its first real test this year since its passage. This year,
Congress ended up doling out nearly $6 billion in emergency
spending to help farmers through a tough season -- problems that
may have been solved through the crop subsidies that were slashed
in the farm bill. Does the bill adequately address the needs of

CLINTON TRAVELS TO MIDEAST TO REVIVE WYE AGREEMENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a trip fraught with political peril, President
Clinton travels Saturday to Israel and Palestinian-controlled
territories as he attempts to revive a faltering 2-month-old peace
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's main mission is to continue to push the Israelis and
Palestinians to adhere to the Wye River Memorandum in which Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed to cede more West Bank territory
in return for security guarantees from Chairman Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew when we left Wye that we would be facing a bumpy road
and some of those bumps have already been jarring, but there can be
no question that Wye has moved us further down the road toward
peace and away from the long and dangerous impasse that proceeded
it,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But the visit has become laden with symbolism as Palestinians
view the stops in Gaza and the West Bank as a step toward
recognition of an independent state, an anathema to many Israelis.
Hard-line conservatives in Israel have urged Clinton to postpone
the trip and have threatened to boycott.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said Clinton's visit should not be interpreted as
endorsement of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (the visit) does not do that. The bottom line here is it is
a part of the Wye agreement. And as we have said many times, the
issue of Palestinian statehood is a permanent status issue. It is
something that needs to be negotiated, and it is part of the next
process,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Violence has marred the region since the leaders signed the Wye
River accord in an elaborate White House ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, his government just weeks away from possible
collapse, has suspended Israeli troop withdrawals in response to
violence in Palestinian areas. The Palestinians are protesting
Israel's refusal to release political prisoners as the Wye accord
required.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, his own health in question, repeatedly has announced his
intention to declare a Palestinian state in May 1999, the deadline
for the completion of the so-called final status talks on delicate
issues such as the status of Jerusalem and Palestine, but those
talks have not yet even begun.
</P>
<P>
   Added to this fractious mix are questions about Clinton's own
status. The president leaves Washington as the House Judiciary
Committee considers four articles of impeachment stemming from
Clinton's lies about an affair with a White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Also invited to join Clinton's entourage are three moderate
Republicans who have yet to make a decision on their impeachment
vote, which is expected to take place next week in the full House.
</P>
<P>
   The trip may shape up as one of Clinton's most brief overseas
ventures this year, but possibly one of his most critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is making this trip because he is dedicated to
helping both sides overcoming the challenges that still exist to a
productive negotiating process and a durable peace,'' Albright
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Clinton will meet privately with Netanyahu, visit the
grave site of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin who was killed by an
Israeli extremist, participate in a Menorah lighting to mark the
first day of Hannukah and speak to young Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can expect the president to make one point very clear:
America has unshakable ties to the state of Israel and enduring
commitment to Israel's security,'' said Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger,
the president's national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is one of our closest allies and shall remain so. I expect
the president to talk in some detail about the Wye River agreement
and why it promotes both the security of Israel and peace of
Israel,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Clinton will fly by helicopter from Jerusalem to the
Gaza Strip where he will address the Palestinian National Council,
which will affirm the Palestinian Liberation Organization's action
earlier this week to strike from the PLO's 1964 charter provisions
calling for Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton agreed to address the council when he was helping broker
the Wye River agreement at the Maryland resort. Now, however,
Netanyahu is demanding that the council take a vote to strike the
provisions, not just affirm the PLO's actions. Arafat has refused,
placing in doubt whether Israel will accept the action.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Clinton will meet with Israeli opposition leaders in
the Labor Party and tour the West Bank city of Bethlehem, tour the
Church of the Nativity with Arafat and light a Christmas tree.
Later, Clinton, joined by Netanyahu, also will tour Masada,
symbolic scene of Jewish resistance to Roman enslavement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very much a part of the Wye agreement for the president
to go and make this trip,'' Albright said. ``I think it will have
an effect of showing that the United States continues to back the
Wye agreement and that the leaders themselves, who made very hard
decisions, will be carrying them out.''

OPENING A WINDOW TO MUNI BOND PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Calif.)   (ART ADV: Graphic of munis a good buy at year end is being sent to
NYT graphic clients. Non-subscribers can make individual purchase
by calling (888) 603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.)  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 13)  
 (af)  
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, someone bought one or more Los Angeles County
pension bonds due in June 2007. The bonds were of the zero-coupon
variety, and the buyer paid dearly _ $613.23 for every $1,000 in
face amount.
</P>
<P>
   Another buyer, the very same day, paid just $568.23 for the same
bond. As a result, the first investor will get a yield to maturity
of 5.79 percent while the second will get a yield of 6.71 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Why the large difference?
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the stock market, where investors can scarcely avoid
learning the latest prices, the municipal bond arena has long been
cloaked in such mystery that just to ask about the detailed terms
of an issue can be akin to breaking a fraternal taboo. And some
brokers have used this secrecy to mark up muni bonds by big
amounts.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, retail customers often do not seem eager to
learn more than the yield and issuer's name, said Joe Mysak, editor
of Grant's Municipal Finance, a newsletter. The retail side, he
said, ``does not want information about municipal bonds.''
</P>
<P>
   But even this arcane and traditional business, whose biggest
patrons are individuals in high tax brackets, is succumbing to the
information age. Just before Thanksgiving, the Bond Market
Association, an industry group, started posting daily transactions
on its Web site _ www.investinginbonds.com _ giving potential
buyers and sellers free access to prices, yields, credit ratings
and other information.
</P>
<P>
   And the window is opening just as specialists in munis are
finding the sector a screaming bargain. Yields can now be fully 95
percent of those on Treasury bonds, which, unlike munis, are
subject to federal income tax.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's new effort at transparency may be welcomed by
investors, who sometimes have difficulty learning details of even
their own transactions, a situation that has increasingly rankled
securities regulators. Through the site, investors can learn what
others are paying, like the first hapless buyer of the California
zero-coupon bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this perception that bonds are more risky than
stocks'' because so little specific information about issuers and
the trading markets reaches the investing public, said Alexandra
Lebenthal, president of the municipal bond specialist firm in New
York bearing her family name. She called the Web site ``a good
thing,'' something that would undoubtedly evolve.
</P>
<P>
   Since the new Web postings started on Nov. 23, the site has had
a 28 percent increase in daily visits. Although the site is updated
just once a day, by 8:45 a.m., and is far from comprehensive _
there are, after all, more than 1.4 million outstanding issues of
state, municipal and government-agency bonds _ it supplies useful
data.
</P>
<P>
   The draw is the prices at which the 1,000 or so most active
issues changed hands in the preceding session; the site lists each
issue that had at least four transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the list allows potential buyers to shop for
appropriate securities on their own and to avoid overreliance on a
broker who may have more incentive to sell them less suitable
merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   The user-friendly features include the ability to sort bonds by
state, credit rating, maturity and yield, as well as to see the
highest and lowest transaction prices.
</P>
<P>
   Investors interested in selling their muni bonds can quickly
determine their approximate value in a secondary market that is
relatively thin, even for more active issues, because most
municipals are put away for keeps.
</P>
<P>
   Without the site, said Peter J. Allegrini, a managing director
at Prudential Investments, ``there are not many ways for people to
verify whether their brokers are giving them the right
information.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Web site prices are not all that current _ on a
Thursday afternoon, say, one might be examining transactions that
took place on Wednesday morning. And it is often difficult to tell
whether a particular high or low price reflects a large block or a
small trade of, say, $10,000 or $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   As in any market, the bigger the transaction in municipals, the
better the price, though some bond industry professionals,
including Ms. Lebenthal, worry about neophytes whose initial
response may point to Web site postings as evidence of a bad deal.
</P>
<P>
   Web prices include dealer markups, the typical form of
compensation in the municipal business. Dealers stoutly resisted
listing actual prices that would show the markups separately.
Typically, these are about one-half of 1 percent to 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The prices on the site are based on those reported by dealers to
the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, a self-regulatory body
based in Washington that in August began providing this information
to vendors.
</P>
<P>
   The association and J.J. Kenny, the Standard &AMP; Poor's unit,
supplement the prices with data on coupons, yields to maturity,
yields to call date, credit ratings and the company insuring the
bonds, if any.
</P>
<P>
   Mysak of Grant's, who has long lamented the paucity of
information generally supplied to muni investors, is enthusiastic
about the new service. ``I think it's terrific,'' he said, noting
the complicated nature of the bonds and the peddling of low-quality
issues backed by ventures like golf courses and retirement centers.
Such bonds, he said, demand particularly close scrutiny. ``It's a
wonderful tool that any investor can learn to use to their
profit.''

WHEN THE PLAY'S NOT THE THING 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Dec. 13) 
(JT) 
 By BOB MORRIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Ticketmaster offered me the choice between a
good seat in January and a lousy one in early December to the
hottest play in town, I chose the lousy one, just to be ahead of
the curve.
</P>
<P>
   And so, with some chagrin, I arrived last Saturday night for a
sold-out preview at the Cort Theater with binoculars in my coat
pocket. Not that having binoculars in a theater was so bad. But
since I was seeing ``The Blue Room,'' I felt sheepish. ``The Blue
Room,'' after all, stars Nicole Kidman and is about sex and only
sex. As you must know by now, the two-character British import by
David Hare (famously dubbed ``pure theatrical Viagra'' by The
London Telegraph) opens today for a limited run that is getting
almost as much attention as that White House intern did not long
ago.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, I needn't have worried about looking too
voyeuristic. As soon as the lights went down, everyone around me
pulled out binoculars. Up there in the rear balcony, far removed
from the big shots in the orchestra, we looked like bird watchers
at a sanctuary during a particularly busy mating season. The play
sparked and shocked, just as sex should. And I'm happy to say that
I found the performances superb. The strange thing is, I would be
just as happy to say they were overrated.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because when you're as interested in seeing something for
its status value as for its artistic value, nothing matters more
than one thing _ seeing it before anyone else you know.
</P>
<P>
   So what if I had to sit in a seat that made me feel as if I were
watching a sports event rather than an intimate play about
intimacy? So what if I was crammed in so tightly up there that I
couldn't move my leg without knocking the binoculars out of the
hands of the well-dressed women on either side of me? And so what
if it took 15 minutes after the play ended to get down the
staircase, where I was jammed between two matrons (one was saying,
``It wasn't romantic _ there wasn't one throb in it for me'') and
three college-age young women shrieking that Tom Cruise, Ms.
Kidman's husband, was definitely in the house? So what, too, if I
was alone on a Saturday night, like a total loser, since pairs of
tickets were impossible to come by? I had just muscled my way
through an experience that would enhance my status for at least a
week, if not longer, and that mattered more than anything.
</P>
<P>
   In a world where hotels and restaurants have ``soft openings''
for insiders before they really open, and where fashion editors go
around declaring as ``over'' a look that has just made it into
stores, because they've already seen the clothes for next season on
the runways, you're nothing if you aren't early.
</P>
<P>
   Museums have private previews for major donors the night before
openings for members. Hollywood hotties have screenings before
premieres, and a handful of power players in New York and
Washington get The New Yorker hand-delivered on Sundays without
asking.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, it wasn't over until the fat lady sang. Now,
it's over before the fat lady opens her mouth.
</P>
<P>
   To get the most out of my prestigiously early ``Blue Room''
experience, I had to flaunt it as quickly as possible. After
threading my way through a mob that had gathered by the stage door
and was spilling into the streets (and was heckling anyone who came
out the stage door who wasn't Ms. Kidman or Cruise), I rushed home
to work the phone. But as it was Saturday night, nobody was around.
I had to wait until morning, when I pulled my first boast on some
friends over coffee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to see it on opening night,'' replied one of them,
who knows the ``Blue Room'' producer, ``and then I'm going to the
dinner afterwards at the Chelsea Piers.''
</P>
<P>
   With a depressing authority that put me in a blue room of my
own, she proceeded to tell me all kinds of things: That Ms. Kidman
shops like a maniac and wears hair extensions, and that her
director, Sam Mendes, is rumored to be going out with Calista
Flockhart. I found this knowingness very deflating, and left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it in London,'' another friend said later, shutting me
down abruptly. ``The theater was tiny, and every time Nicole took
her shirt off the entire audience turned around to look at Tom, who
was unable to hide in the back of the house. In New York, he
watches from the lighting booth.''
</P>
<P>
   Another friend had just gotten back from a Sunday matinee of the
show, where she and her husband had third-row orchestra seats.
``Doesn't Nicole Kidman have the most amazing skin?'' she asked.
From where I'd been sitting, and even with binoculars pressed to my
nose the whole time, I had no idea.
</P>
<P>
   Like social climbing and getting upgraded on airlines, this game
was a lot harder to play than I thought. One friend seemed
genuinely interested in hearing about Ms. Kidman's buttocks (small,
without cellulite), but she was late for Sandra Bernhard's book
party at the Mercer Kitchen. ``Isn't that more prestigious than
seeing Nicole Kidman on stage?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Another had just gotten a longer dose of nudity at an elevating
performance by Ballett Frankfurt at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
``That beats Nicole Kidman's butt any day,'' she snapped.
</P>
<P>
   Even an anthropologist friend in Papua New Guinea, to whom I had
bragged by e-mail, was closer to the heat than I'd ever be. Her ex
used to work in Cruise's office and had regaled her with stories of
his antics.
</P>
<P>
   So then, was there nobody who would allow me to cash in at the
full exchange rate on ``The Blue Room,'' which Newsweek, in a cover
story last week, called the hottest ticket for a nonmusical in
Broadway history?
</P>
<P>
   My parents were at a Ramada Inn in Corpus Christi, Texas, for an
Elderhostel. I called them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never heard of it,'' my mother said. When I explained the
gist, she fell silent. ``Oh, that's terrible,'' she sighed. ``And
this is a big deal right now? What kind of society do we live in
anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   My father was a little less judgmental. ``Sex in every scene,''
he said. ``Is she a Catholic? Do you think she's trying to make
some kind of a statement?''
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't what I had in mind at all, but instead of telling
him she's a Scientologist, like her husband, I dropped the subject.
There were more improving things to talk about anyway, like the
weather and their bird-watching seminar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at shore birds and at one of the biggest pelican
hatcheries in the world,'' my father bragged. Of course, they had
their binoculars on hand for the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I don't suppose you'll be using them,'' I said sourly,
``to look at anything but birds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly not,'' my father replied. ``With no ifs, ands or,
um, buts.''

<P>
   IMPEACH-REVIEW _ What an impeachment trial really is. By David
Rosenbaum. Story still in preparation late Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   TOYS-KIDS-REVIEW (Undated) _ America's children are being buried
in an avalanche of toys. It's partly a function of demographics:
There are fewer children and more adults to dote on them. Fueling
the trend are TV's ceaseless shilling of merchandise, guilt on the
part of working, often absentee parents, clevermarketing of toys as
learning tools, and the inescapable realization that a kid
transfixed by a toy is a kid temporarily not bothering a parent.
Now some professionals fear children are being simultaneously
overstimulated and desensitized by a deluge of misguided love. By
Douglas Martin.
</P>
<P>

   IMPEACH-REVIEW _ What an impeachment trial really is. By David
Rosenbaum. Story still in preparation late Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   TOYS-KIDS-REVIEW (Undated) _ America's children are being buried
in an avalanche of toys. It's partly a function of demographics:
There are fewer children and more adults to dote on them. Fueling
the trend are TV's ceaseless shilling of merchandise, guilt on the
part of working, often absentee parents, clevermarketing of toys as
learning tools, and the inescapable realization that a kid
transfixed by a toy is a kid temporarily not bothering a parent.
Now some professionals fear children are being simultaneously
overstimulated and desensitized by a deluge of misguided love. By
Douglas Martin.

AZALEAS? NO! A CHRISTMAS CACTUS? YES! 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Dec. 13) 
(JT) 
 By CASS PETERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I confess to a general dislike of flowering plants used as
decoration for the winter holidays. Possibly this is because I've
always lived in a temperate zone with four distinct seasons. Winter
is by rights the bloomless one.
</P>
<P>
   December and January belong to evergreens and berried branches,
to sprays of laurel and magnolia leaves where those plants can be
grown, and to bowls of colorful fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Potted azaleas and narcissus are acceptable in February and
March, when they anticipate spring, instead of mimicking it. In
December, they strike me as anachronisms.
</P>
<P>
   I sympathize with the floral industry's desire to cash in on the
buying season by persuading consumers that cyclamen should be a
holiday tradition and that chrysanthemums aren't just for Halloween
and Thanksgiving anymore. But azaleas blooming next to the
Christmas tree or menorah make as much sense to me as a balsam
wreath on the front door on Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
   The poinsettia is a forgivable cliche. It's been around so long
that it's practically synonymous with holly and pine cones, and in
any case it isn't linked with any other season or occasion. No one
runs out for a pot of poinsettias to brighten the picnic table for
the Fourth of July.
</P>
<P>
   That might happen one day, though, if poinsettia breeders keep
extending the color range beyond the traditional and appropriate
red. There are now pastel pink and primrose yellow poinsettias, and
mottled poinsettias in summery colors like hot pink and salmon.
</P>
<P>
   The colors are not unattractive, and there are those who prefer
them. To me, a pastel poinsettia has as much character as a pale,
out-of-season strawberry, which is another thing that should never
be brought into the house outside its natural time.
</P>
<P>
   Amaryllis are tolerable as holiday plants, preferably ones with
pure white or bold red flowers, which at least enhance the hues of
the season. These bulb-grown plants are so popular as hostess gifts
that it would not be wise to actively dislike them, even if that
were possible. Amaryllis are too striking to dislike, with their
stout stalks topped by a cluster of lilylike blooms.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, what is sold as amaryllis is in the species
Hippeastrum. The only true amaryllis is A. belladonna, a hardy
perennial that sends up straplike leaves in the spring, dies to the
ground, and then reappears in the autumn as leafless stalks topped
by pink blossoms. I've heard it called both resurrection lily and
surprise lily.
</P>
<P>
   I think of the Christmas-season amaryllis as appropriate for the
winter because it has no normal outdoor season in my Pennsylvania
climate. If it were hardy enough to survive as a perennial, I might
prefer to see it in bloom in May or June.
</P>
<P>
   There is one holiday bloomer that I like. It's the Christmas
cactus, which is not really a cactus but a type of epiphyllum that
is native to tropical rain forests.
</P>
<P>
   The species is properly Schlumbergera, for a botanist named
Schlumberger who saw it hanging from the trees in Brazil and
presumably recognized its ultimate worth as a holiday decoration,
but it's usually identified as Zygocactus.
</P>
<P>
   What I like about the Christmas cactus is that it's around all
year and blooms, with a little assistance, from late November
through January. It's an easy-to-raise houseplant that can be
parked outdoors during the summer. Its fleshy leaves are flat and
scalloped at the edges, and grow in jointed segments, like squashed
pop-beads.
</P>
<P>
   It spreads outwardly and drapes, and can grow to prodigious
size. The flowers look like elongated roses and form at the ends of
the stems. Usually they are deep pink, fuchsia, white or red.
</P>
<P>
   A Christmas cactus needs long spells of darkness to impel flower
formation. In northern regions, where day length naturally shortens
to fewer than 10 or 11 hours in autumn and early winter, it will
bloom at the right time without any help from the gardener.
</P>
<P>
   Where days stay long later into the season, the cactus should be
put into a dark room or closet each evening around 5 and brought
out again at 7 in the morning (or whatever suits your schedule; the
cactus won't care, as long as it's 14 hours), starting in early
October. By mid-November, the flower buds should be formed, and
then the cactus can stay out of the closet all day.
</P>
<P>
   There are species that don't require quite so much darkness to
form flowers, and will bloom earlier. These are known,
appropriately enough, as Thanksgiving cactuses.
</P>
<P>
   The most common cause of failure with a Christmas cactus is too
much faith in its name. It isn't really a cactus but a forest
plant. It requires moisture, but not too much. It should be planted
in well-drained potting soil, but not the sandy mix that true
cactuses appreciate. A Christmas cactus enjoys misting, or having
its pot set on a tray of wet pebbles.
</P>
<P>
   Direct sunlight is a bit much for a Christmas cactus, too.
Bright indirect light is fine, but a Christmas cactus in the south
window will likely shrivel and develop blemishes on its leaves.
That's sunburn. If you summer it outdoors, it should be put in a
spot protected from direct sun.
</P>
<P>
   Properly cared for, a Christmas cactus can live for 20 years,
and it's easy to start new plants from stems broken off and rooted
in damp vermiculite or sand. That's a great deal more than one can
say about a potted azalea.
</P>

FINANCIAL GIANT SEEKING A BIG FOOTPRINT IN FUNDS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 13) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Conn., Mass.)   (af)  
 By CAROLE GOULD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Gary C. Wendt steps down as head of GE Capital Services, the
financing arm of General Electric, he leaves behind a financial
services juggernaut involved in everything from credit cards to
equipment leasing. But a recent flurry of advertisements shows that
GE Capital is working hard to raise its profile in another business
_ mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``GE is already a household name,'' said Michael J. Cosgrove,
president of the investment services group for GE Financial
Assurance, a unit of GE Capital. ``We have the advantages of two
views of life _ the Main Street, because of our consumer business,
and the Wall Street viewpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   GE, based in Fairfield, Conn., already offers eight stock and
four bond funds to the public and plans to start 12 others next
year. Four of them, including junk-bond and European stock funds,
will be available in January.
</P>
<P>
   As of Oct. 31, the company had $13 billion in mutual fund
assets, according to the Financial Research Corp., a consulting
group in Boston. That places it 53rd among fund companies. But GE's
chief executive, John F. Welch, is known for his directive that the
company not remain in a business unless it can be one of the top
two players in the market.
</P>
<P>
   The industry leaders, Fidelity Investments and the Vanguard
Group, have $460.2 billion and $349.3 billion in assets,
respectively, according to Financial Research.
</P>
<P>
   So how big are GE's plans? Cosgrove is optimistic. He expects to
have $20 billion under management within five years and $100
billion within 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is difficult to imagine GE muscling its way past
Vanguard. Cosgrove said that it all had to do with how you define a
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at mutual funds, you look at the segment that
you want to service,'' he said. He declined to identify that
segment, but he said the 401(k) market and the so-called retail
intermediary market _ funds sold by brokers, bankers and financial
planners _ were ``clearly very important.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are the channels through which GE Capital sells its funds
today. Over all the funds' records are pretty good, but not great.
Most equity funds performed above the average of their category
based on three year returns, according to Morningstar Inc., the
financial publisher in Chicago. Among the bond funds, some have had
superior performance and others have lagged behind their peers.
</P>
<P>
   GE's history in the fund business goes back to 1935, when it
started managing what were called the Electric funds, intended for
middle and upper management at the company who performed charitable
work. Those funds, now the Elfun funds and still for GE employees,
have $4.5 billion in assets.
</P>
<P>
   A fund group started in the 1950s, the Savings and Security
Program funds, are now part of GE's 401(k) plan. That group has
$6.8 billion in assets.
</P>
<P>
   The GE funds _ the ones now being promoted to the public _ were
started in 1993 and include many clones of funds from the first two
groups. They carry steep sales charges: 5.75 percent for stock
funds and 4.75 percent for bond funds.
</P>
<P>
   While GE does not disclose the revenues of its mutual funds, it
is presumably just a drop in the bucket for the company, which had
total revenue of $90.8 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a small slice of the business and not something I spend a
lot of time on,'' said Jeffrey Sprague, an analyst with Salomon
Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   In general, analysts were not terribly optimistic about GE's
fund prospects. ``It's small potatoes for them,'' said William E.
Fiala, an analyst with Edward Jones &AMP; Co. GE could build a strong
presence, but only ``in time, and only through acquisitions,''
Fiala said. ``They didn't have a good experience with investment
banking,'' he added. ``The Kidder Peabody acquisition left a sour
taste in their mouths.''

THE MUSE OF SHAKESPEARE IMAGINED AS A BLONDE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 13) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many things about William Shakespeare's life and work are
shrouded in mystery, but the mystery of what scholars call his lost
years is one of the most intriguing of all. What did Shakespeare do
between 1585, when he is known to have left his home in
Stratford-on-Avon, and 1592, when he re-emerged in London,
described as an ``upstart crow'' in the account of a rival
playwright?
</P>
<P>
   And how did he make the enormous artistic leap between his early
plays, flawed works like the bloody ``Titus Andronicus,'' and his
romantic masterpiece, ``Romeo and Juliet,'' first performed in
1594?
</P>
<P>
   No one knows for sure, and ``Shakespeare in Love'' provides a
fanciful explanation by imagining the young Shakespeare (Joseph
Fiennes) as a nearly unknown actor and playwright who finds his
poetic voice through a passionate love affair with one Viola De
Lesseps, a woman as clever as she is beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   That Viola never actually existed, and that she is played by the
certifiably American Gwyneth Paltrow (albeit with a plausible
English accent), didn't matter to the filmmakers. The movie, which
opened on Friday, is meant to be a high-entertainment mix of fact
and fiction, combining a modern sensibility with Shakespearean
language and period flourishes, full of the double meanings and sly
jokes that characterize the work of Tom Stoppard, its co-writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's glorious is that so little is known about this period
that you're not trapped by any kind of historical circumstance,''
said John Madden, the director, who is accustomed to reading
between the lines of English history, his most recent film having
been ``Mrs. Brown,'' which explored the relationship between Queen
Victoria and one of her equerries.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, Shakespeare was seen as some sort of hack; his
genius was just being recognized,'' Madden said. ``One of the great
things is to catch him at this moment, when he wasn't the Bard,
when he was just a jobbing actor trying to make his way while
suffering from the kind of pressures that we all suffer from. At
the same time, he has this genius that he could just turn on like a
tap.''
</P>
<P>
   What is it like to play a man whose myth now looms so large in
our literary consciousness? Fiennes said he soon got over any
misgivings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare is often portrayed as a boring, iconic, almost
mythical person,'' said Fiennes, 28. ``But I embraced Tom's script
because it gives him a warmer, more generous human touch.''
</P>
<P>
   There was also a darker side to Shakespeare, one that is touched
on in the film as the playwright freely lifts plot and character
ideas from other people and mines his experiences for his art.
</P>
<P>
   ``His love affair is real and profound, and he's lost in the
chaos,'' Fiennes said, ``but at the same time he's almost a leech,
constantly looking for copy and almost making things happen in
order to get a story.''
</P>
<P>
   The formidable cast also includes Ms. Paltrow's boyfriend, Ben
Affleck, as Ned Alleyn, the actor playing Mercutio in the
play-within-the-film version of ``Romeo and Juliet''; Geoffrey Rush
as Philip Henslowe, the theatrical producer; Rupert Everett as the
playwright Christopher Marlowe, Shakespeare's archrival, and a
roll-call of British character actors: Imelda Staunton as Viola's
nurse and confidante; the hunky Colin Firth as Viola's unpleasant
fiance, the Earl of Wessex, and Judi Dench as a haughty but
feminist Queen Elizabeth I.
</P>
<P>
   The film opens to a theatrical crisis. The wolves are at the
door: Henslowe, who runs the Rose Theater, is trying to beat back
competition from its rival, the Curtain, but he is heavily in debt
and desperately in need of a hit. He hopes that Shakespeare, his
current playwright-for-hire, will come through with a play that
gives the public what it seems to want: a romance, a shipwreck and
some slapstick humor involving an unruly dog.
</P>
<P>
   But Shakespeare's play, tentatively titled ``Romeo and Ethel,
the Pirate's Daughter,'' is not being written. Bereft of
inspiration, Shakespeare is suffering from writer's block, sitting
in his garret in London, throwing page after page of his work into
the garbage.
</P>
<P>
   It is not until he meets Viola and falls instantly, heavily, in
love that he finds the muse he has longed for. As the two enter
into a steamy, illicit affair _ she is rich and has a fiance; he is
poor and has a wife back home _ he finds that words of love and
longing and poetry are flowing, as if by magic, from his quill. And
the play he ends up writing, ``Romeo and Juliet,'' is different
from anything he, or anyone else, has ever produced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare was doing something radical for his time,'' said
Marc Norman, the Hollywood screenwriter who conceived the plot some
years ago (one of his sons gave him the idea), wrote the initial
script and is credited as co-writer with Stoppard. ``Playwrights
writing in that period all adhered to the notion that comedies were
comedies and tragedies were tragedies, that a comedy is a story
about love that ends in marriage, and that a tragedy ends in death.
But in `Romeo and Juliet,' Shakespeare was starting with a comedy
and ending with a tragedy, and nobody had ever done that before.''
</P>
<P>
   To Norman, the most interesting question surrounding the play
was how Shakespeare was able to leave his more immature work behind
and create a piece of such grace and power. ``I started to wonder
what caused him to do that, what caused him to make that choice,''
Norman said. ``I thought, `What if he had a love affair with a
woman who inspired him in the course of writing the play?'''
</P>
<P>
   After Norman's initial script, in the early 1990s, Tom Stoppard,
the witty and erudite playwright who has supplemented
intellectually challenging plays like ``Arcadia'' and ``The
Invention of Love'' with a succession of screenplays (``Empire of
the Sun'' and ``Brazil,'' among others) was brought in for rewrites
(the project then languished in Hollywood limbo for some years,
moving from Universal to Miramax).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The resulting film is unmistakably Stoppardian, existing on
several levels at once, made for a 20th-century audience but full
of Elizabethan-era in-jokes and allusions to Shakespeare's and
others' works.
</P>
<P>
   At times, Stoppard has Shakespeare speaking lines from his own
plays as dialogue in his daily life, and at times he interjects
very modern witticisms about the plight of writers (Shakespeare is
forever being mistaken for the far more famous and successful
Marlowe) and the absurd vanity that pervades the theater.
</P>
<P>
   The movie also forms a loose parallel to a Shakespearean play
itself, lacing its comic elements with semitragedy, cross-dressing
(Viola defies Elizabethan convention and fools even Shakespeare by
auditioning for ``Romeo and Juliet'' dressed as a boy), and even
the odd sword fight or two. A number of details are also thrown in
for the benefit of those familiar with Elizabethan cultural
history.
</P>
<P>
   There is, for example, a scene in which Shakespeare practices
writing his name and then settles on the now-much-reproduced form
of his signature, and there is the emergence of a minor character,
a boy named John Roberts who plays with rats and enjoys the theater
only for its blood and gore. The joke is that he's the same John
Roberts who will go on to write works like ``The Duchess of
Malfi,'' the Jacobean horror play.
</P>
<P>
   But Madden, the director, is at pains to make it clear that
knowing about Shakespeare and his time are not necessary to
enjoying the film. ``The screenplay has been carefully crafted so
that everyone can catch up and understand it and follow it,'' he
said. ``For anyone who wants to spot the references, they're all
there, but that absolutely must not be a requirement for seeing the
film. They're a bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   One suspects that the need to tone down the erudition to widen
the film's appeal might have sat heavily with the clever Stoppard.
But he knew what he was getting into when he signed up, he said.
``Broadly speaking, in theater the director is there to do his best
to serve the writer, and in movies the writer is there to serve the
director,'' he said. ``I wear a very different writing hat in
movies.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``It's an interesting medium, popular film,
because it's not a homogeneous audience. They get quite schizoid,
and they don't know whether they're making the film for the critic
of The New Yorker or someone who's had a busy day in Newark and
wants to relax.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Stoppard enjoyed not having to worry about
historical accuracy. Among other things, he was free to make up
characters that didn't exist, invent scenes that never happened
(between Marlowe and Shakespeare, for instance), and play around
with the essence of his real-life characters in his own
imagination, something he has done in many of his plays (he has
also fooled around with Shakespeare before, in ``Rosencranz And
Guildenstern Are Dead'').
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a special take on historical accuracy, which is that
all supposed historical truths are temporary, meaning they're
always there to be modified in the light of subsequent
discoveries,'' Stoppard said. ``But this film is entertainment,
which doesn't require it to be justified in the light of historical
theory.''
</P>
<P>
   For people who love the theater, the film also provides ample
opportunity to laugh at the vanity and puffery that surround the
acting world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom has lived his life in the theater and been around that
breed,'' Madden said of Stoppard. ``He has a wonderfully accurate
eye and ear for the kind of little fabrications that actors tell
each other. It was very nice to have the opportunity to send all of
that up from a historical perspective, where you see the beginnings
of modern show business developing.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the people involved in the film also found another of
its premises _ that a passionate love affair stirs writerly
creativity, rather than so exhausting the writer that he spends his
days sleeping off his long nights _ very seductive. Stoppard, for
one, has always found that to be true. ``I think it happily works
both ways,'' he said. ``A successful good day's work is a good
aphrodisiac, and a successful night's lovemaking is quite an
inspiration.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare in Love'' closes with a neat premise, that
Shakespeare continues to draw inspiration from his romance,
immortalizing her in ``The Tempest.'' ``That's a very romantic
thought,'' Stoppard said, ``that she never grows old and never
dies.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras _ It's been well more than a month since
Hurricane Mitch walloped Central America.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the storm's wrath didn't end with the rains for the
shell-shocked people packed like animals inside an emergency
shelter at the Leovigildo Cardona Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   In one tiny classroom, a very pregnant Aida Celeste sleeps on a
piece of cardboard, without a pillow, on the cold, cement floor.
</P>
<P>
   She shares the damp space, which is marked off by desks, boxes
and stacks of old clothes, with at least a dozen strangers.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to relief workers, she has all the tins of tuna fish and
cans of green beans she could possibly ever want.
</P>
<P>
   Now what she really needs is money to rebuild her makeshift
house, swallowed by a mudslide during the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't take anything with me when my house fell down; I just
ran for my life,'' said Celeste, 23, a shy, soft-spoken woman with
a 2-year-old son. ``I sit here each day with my son, wondering if I
will ever have a place to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Her predicament is all too common.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Mitch meandered over Honduras and neighboring
Nicaragua, for nearly six days in late October, destroying or
damaging tens of thousands of homes and leaving displaced nearly 2
million people, or 40 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Most are holed up in the unaffected houses of family and
friends.
</P>
<P>
   But more than 200,000 people have been herded into temporary
shelters, mostly in schools, but also in churches and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   In Tegucigalpa alone, at least 20,000 people have been squeezed
into the close confines of 130 shelters, where they live in almost
unbearable conditions, with no privacy.
</P>
<P>
   In San Pedro Sula, the country's second-largest city, thousands
have been packed into the new soccer stadium, which has been turned
into a refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
   Cramped quarters force healthy people to live alongside sick
ones suffering from rashes, infections and conjunctivitis, and
women must sleep beside men they hardly know.
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure what will happen once many of these shelters are
closed in January to prepare for the beginning of school in
February.
</P>
<P>
   Relief workers worry that absolute poverty -- no home, no income
-- will give these people little choice but to live on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some shelters, men who don't belong there have come in and
tried to rape the girls,'' said Brenda Martinez, who works for
CARE, an Atlanta-based relief organization. ``I don't think anyone
has succeeded, but it is just not a good situation for the women.''
</P>
<P>
   The Honduran government, with the help of foreign aid, plans
over the short-term to build at least 3,000 new homes in and around
Tegucigalpa, the country's capital city.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not nearly enough to accommodate the country's legion
of homeless, meaning it may take years before many lives return to
normal.
</P>
<P>
   At the shelter at the Jorge Roberto Maradiaga Elementary School
here, Paula Valladares, 23, shares a cot and one blanket with her
three children, ages 5, 3 and 1, while her husband sleeps on the
floor beside them.
</P>
<P>
   They live with three other families in a dingy classroom that's
no bigger than a living room in a typical home in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   They hang a torn bedspread from the ceiling when they want to
discreetly change clothes, and heat rice and beans over an open
fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to make tortillas and then sell them for money, but now
I don't have any materials to make tortillas,'' said Valladares,
who wears one of the few garments she owns, a flimsy, see-through
nightgown. ``My husband is trying to do some construction work, but
I don't know how we will find money to build a house.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, they have no choice but to remain at the school, which
provides shelter to more than 120 other people.
</P>
<P>
   With no electricity or running water, the smell from six
overflowing toilets is almost suffocating.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, relief workers deliver several barrels of water to
the shelter weekly.
</P>
<P>
   Women wash their mostly tattered clothing by hand, hanging it on
ropes to dry in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   In the courtyard, dozens of children, many wearing only
flip-flops and oversized T-shirts, chase each other and toss a ball
back and forth, seemingly oblivious to their surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   Babies crawl at their feet, most with runny noses and no
diapers.
</P>
<P>
   Their parents, on the other hand, look dazed as they sit on the
ground swapping stories for the umpteenth time about the torrential
downpour that attacked like a biblical plague.
</P>
<P>
   ``The walls of my house started cracking, and it was nighttime,
so it was dark, but still I just knew that the house was going to
fall down,'' said Olga Vaquis, 22. ``I grabbed my two children out
of bed and just started running, and it was muddy and, we fell, but
we just kept going because we were scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the families are from Colonia Soto, a working-class
neighborhood overlooking the Choluteca River that virtually buckled
under the weight of the rains.
</P>
<P>
   Before the storm, the community included 800 homes. Today, there
are fewer than 50.
</P>
<P>
   Already the second-poorest country in the Western Hemisphere,
after Haiti, Honduras bore the brunt of Hurricane Mitch, which
killed 10,000 people across Central America.
</P>
<P>
   At least 5,657 people are dead, 8,058 are missing, and 12,272
are injured in the Honduras alone.
</P>
<P>
   Total losses are estimated at $4 billion -- or roughly the gross
domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 72 hours, we lost what we had built, little by little, in
50 years,'' said Honduran President Carlos Flores Facusse.
</P>
<P>
   Food and supplies have poured in from around the world, so much
so that relief workers now warn that it could destroy the local
market.
</P>
<P>
   More goods have been flown in to Central America than during the
Berlin Airlift of 1948, when the United States was forced to drop
food from airplanes when the Soviets blocked the German city at the
beginning of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government, which has sent more than 3,600 troops to
Central America to help distribute supplies and rebuild
infrastructure, has handed out 2.3 million pounds of food and
863,000 pounds of medicine in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo said
Friday during a visit here that HUD will provide $5 million in
emergency assistance to help rebuild housing in Central America.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. aid to the region now totals more than $400 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly the best way to have an immediate impact now is to
give a cash contribution because it can be directed toward the most
urgent needs, such as providing permanent housing for all those
people who need it,'' said Mark Schneider, assistant administrator
for Latin America for the U.S. Agency for International Development
in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment was echoed by actor-activist Edward James Olmos,
who spent five days touring the devastation in Honduras last month.
``I've helped after Hurricane
</P>
<P>
   Andrew and other disasters, but this was the worst thing I've
ever seen,'' said Olmos, a spokesman for UNICEF. ``We have 20 to 30
years of work to do in Honduras to get that country back to where
it was just six weeks ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tegucigalpa, a city of 1.3 million, appears
deceptively normal these days, at least on the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Burger Kings are bustling with customers, and Nissan dealerships
are overflowing with crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Water service has been restored to many neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   But the cliff-like hills that ring the city look like they've
been blasted by a bomb, with houses replaced by piles of mud,
stones and scattered tiles.
</P>
<P>
   Nestled in a bowl-shaped valley, poor migrants for years have
built settlements on steep mountains when they couldn't afford
flatter, safer land.
</P>
<P>
   They've destroyed trees and vegetation to have building sites,
fuel to cook with and construction supplies.
</P>
<P>
   When the storm hit, the rains triggered landslides along the
deforested hills, gobbling up everything in their paths.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent a recurrence of this tragedy, a new law has been
passed that prohibits the rebuilding of houses in dangerous zones.
</P>
<P>
   But it remains to be seen how well this rule can be carried out
in a country where so many people are eager to build homes.
</P>
<P>
   One person who might have helped was Mayor Cesar Castellanos,
who worked for years to move people out of unstable areas but was
killed in a helicopter crash last month while surveying the
hurricane's damage.
</P>
<P>
   Many businesses and nonprofit groups plan to help with
reconstruction efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Home Depot, for example, has given CARE a credit
of $10,000 for building materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is going to be a hard, long-term effort because we
have to create whole new communities, since we can't put people
back where they were,'' said Marc de Lamotte, CARE's director in
Honduras. ``Meanwhile, I ask myself whether I would be able to live
with my family in a shelter under such poor conditions, and I
really don't think I could.''

   LABOR _ While America rides an unprecedented economic boom, a
quiet revolution is going on in the factories across America.
Senior workers with their jobs threatened and nearing retirement
often approve two-tier wage systems. The differences in wages are
staggering. Senior assembly line workers earning up to $21 an hour
work with younger workers doing identical jobs earning $7.50 an
hour. It can also take up to two years for a new worker to be
covered by insurance and other benefits. At GM, the company is
going a step further: outsourcing and selling off various divisions
_ at great impact to families in this community. And at Navistar in
Springfield, the viability of an entire community largely depends
on its decision to move its truck production to Mexico, where more
and more companies are taking advantage of cheap labor.

   AFIT _ Less than a year ago, the Air Force seemed to be digging
the Air Force Institute of Technology's grave. Today AFIT is
digging the next chapter in its history: an $8.9 million laboratory
that will allow its graduate-level engineering students to study
micromachines, high-energy lasers, and other military technology.
The Air Force unlocked construction funds for the project earlier
this year after an independent study showed AFIT's military value,
and ground was broken last week. The lab should be finished by June
of 2000. AFIT is also restructuring itself, slimming down from two
schools with eight departments to one school with six departments.
AFIT commandant Col. John Russell said it matches a downsizing
military. I will try to get some quotes to put AFIT's survival in a
local economic context. (Gaffney, Dayton Daily News). 10. FOR

PINOCHET, IN COURT, SAYS ONLY CHILE MAY CONSIDER CHARGES AGAINST
HIM  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By WARREN HOGE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Making his first appearance in public since his arrest
two months ago, Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator,
sternly told a London court Friday that he did not acknowledge the
right of any court outside his own country to consider charges
against him.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet uttered his defiant claim at the end of a hearing on a
Spanish order seeking his extradition to Madrid to stand trial on
charges of crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``With respect to your honor,'' the general said in Spanish,
reading from a sheet of paper he held throughout the 20-minute
session, ``I do not recognize the jurisdiction of any other court,
except in my country, to try me against all the lies of Spain.''
With a wave of his hand, he looked up and said, ``That is all I
want to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Clive Nicholls, one of his lawyers, followed up with assurances
that no disrespect to the court's authority was intended. ``I hear
what he says,'' Graham Parkinson, the chief metropolitan
stipendiary magistrate, said. ``My duty is to conduct this
proceeding in accordance with the extradition act passed in
England, and I must do so. I do not take any disrespect.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's wife, Lucia, told supporters at a hotel rally on
Thursday night that her husband would ``never lack the strength of
mind to hold his head high in the name of Chile,'' and the general
looked grimly determined to keep that pledge from the moment he
entered the spare and cramped hearing room.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a dark brown business suit, off-white shirt and gold
tie, the 83-year-old general was seated in the wheelchair he has
used since undergoing back surgery in early October, with his hands
folded across the top of a wooden walking stick held between his
knees.
</P>
<P>
   At the routine question to give his name, he drew himself up and
said: ``I am Augusto Pinochet Ugarte. I was commander in chief of
the army, captain general of Chile, president of the Republic, and
actually I am at the moment a senator of the Republic.'' When
Parkinson said he had not heard the translation properly, the
general was asked to identify himself again, and he gave a
word-perfect repetition with the same set jaw.
</P>
<P>
   In legal terms Friday's session was a simple bail hearing, but
it was also a day of high drama. Hundreds of supporters and
protesters chanted slogans and beat drums as the police convoy
bearing the man who once wielded absolute authority in his country
sped into the dreary Belmarsh courthouse next to a maximum security
prison in a bleak lowland area known as Plumstead Marsh. A beige
coat was pressed against the back window of his van to try to block
any view of him.
</P>
<P>
   With the general glowering from his position in front of the
dock while an interpreter whispered in his ear, Parkinson crisply
read out the charges against him: attempted murder, conspiracy to
murder, torture, conspiracy to torture, hostage-taking and
conspiracy to take hostages. At strategic points about the crowded
room were armed police officers in bulky bulletproof tunics.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question from one of his lawyers, his bail
conditions were amended to permit him to take exercise in the
garden of the rented home in suburban Surrey where he is living
under police guard. ``It would be inhumane to stop the senator
walking in the garden as and when necessary,'' Parkinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after several minutes of consulting daily agendas, a new
date, Jan. 18, was set for the next hearing, a procedural session
that will not require the general to be present.
</P>
<P>
   He was then wheeled out a side door, and minutes later the
motorcade left the court grounds and turned onto the highway, a
police helicopter tracking its passage back to Surrey, 40 miles
away.
</P>
<P>
   Spain wants Pinochet extradited to face charges of mass murder,
torture and terrorism in connection with the more than 3,000 people
who died or disappeared during the 17 years he ruled Chile.
</P>
<P>
   A new legal clash occurs on Tuesday when a committee of the Law
Lords of the House of Lords takes up a request by the Pinochet
lawyers to reconsider their judgment last month that the general
does not have immunity from arrest in England. It was that Nov. 25
decision, a surprise reversal of a High Court verdict in his favor
a month earlier, that set the Pinochet case on its present course,
which could stretch on for more than a year.

AMERICANS WHO MATTERED, FROM PRESIDENTS TO GANGSTERS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif., Mo., Colo., Pa., R.I.) (bl)

   After 10 years of work, Oxford University Press is publishing
the 24-volume American National Biography next month. With 17,450
biographies written by 6,100 scholars and writers, the publishers
of the Biography aim to create a comprehensive portrait of American
history (priced at a mere $2,500).
</P>
<P>
   How to navigate such a massive collection? You could try looking
up entries under subject matter, contributor or place of birth. But
the most interesting index by far is the one organized by
``Occupation and Realms of Renown.'' There you can, of course, find
the usual suspects _ Presidents, Financiers, Explorers, Diplomats,
Inventors and so on.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're searching for the more uncommon protagonists of
American history, you can find them, too _ Chanters, Blind People,
Christian Converts, Fluegelhorn Players, Smugglers, Gurus,
Gangsters, Undertakers and Murder Victims (Crazy Horse makes this
list). You can even find ``alleged'' protagonists, under Alleged
Heretics (like Algernon Sidney Crapsey, who was brought up on
heresy charges by the Episcopal church), Alleged Traitors (like
Nicholas Bayard, who was charged with treason by the Dutch for
siding with the English in 1702) or Alleged Murderers (like Lizzie
Borden or Sacco and Vanzetti).
</P>
<P>
   Many people end up cross-indexed under a number of headings.
John Jacob Astor IV, for example, turns up as a Business Leader as
well as a Shipwreck Victim (RMS Titanic).
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the entries:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Adventuresses  &LR;  Although you might expect her to be found under
famous divorcees or duchesses, Wallis Warfield Simpson _ the woman
for whom Edward, the Prince of Wales, gave up the throne of England
in 1936 _ is considered both a `socialite'' and an ``adventuress.''
What earns her that title? Maybe what the American National
Biography calls her lack of ``passion'' for Edward.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Brothel Keepers &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Sally Stanford was not only one of San Francisco's most
prominent madams in the 1940s, but also a restaurant owner and
eventually the mayor of Sausalito in 1976. She entered politics
after a disagreement with city officials over an electric sign over
her restaurant. ``Her platform included support for a ferry system
to get people out of their cars and acquisition of waterfront
property for public use.'' After her term ended in 1980, she was
elected vice mayor for life.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Comb Player  &LR;  Red McKenzie was a bellhop at the Claridge Hotel
in St. Louis during the early 1920s when he began humming jazz
melodies into a comb wrapped in newspaper. He formed a trio, and
went on to make blues recordings, play vaudeville houses and sing;
later he became a talent scout and promoted other jazz musicians.
``It may be difficult for some to take his `blue-blowing'
seriously, but as an extension of the human voice it is no less
valid a means of expression than the growling effects of Pee Wee
Russell on clarinet or Bubber Miley on cornet.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Eccentrics  &LR;  Known as the ``Witch of Wall Street,'' Hetty
Green, a banker and private money lender, was the richest woman in
America when she died in 1916. She was so obsessed with money that
after her son injured his leg in an accident, she disguised herself
and him so they could get into charity clinics instead of paying
for a doctor. The leg eventually turned gangrenous and had to be
amputated. She wore the same black dress and bonnet for years and
constantly moved from cheap boardinghouses to cold-water walkups to
avoid assassins and tax collectors.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Hatters  &LR;  John Batterson Stetson headed West in 1860 in the
hopes of regaining his health after contracting tuberculosis. In
the course of searching for gold fields in Colorado he noticed that
people needed more protective headgear. So when he returned to
Philadelphia he developed ``The Boss of the Plains, '' a hat with a
wider brim and a high crown to keep out the sun and rain and keep
the head cooler. It was, as John Wayne said, the ``hat that won the
West.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Lighthouse Keeper  &LR;  Ida Lewis, who maintained the Lime Rock
light in Newport, R.I., was the first female lighthouse keeper in
the United States. A heroic rescuer of those in need, she saved 18
people, altogether, and one sheep. The editor of Harper's New
Monthly Magazine declared in 1869 that only a ``donkey'' would call
her actions unfeminine.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Military Deserter  &LR;  David Fagen was one of the African-American
soldiers sent to the Philippines when Spain gave the United States
the islands after the Spanish-American War. Once there, he defected
from the U.S. Army and joined the guerrilla war against the
Americans, becoming a captain in the Filipino national army.
``Fagen's actions in the fall of 1899 mark the beginnings of an
extraordinary expression of African-American solidarity with
Filipino nationalist aspirations for independence.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Seamstresses  &LR;  Although Betsy Ross is the legendary designer
and creator of the first American flag, the official biography says
there is ``little contemporary evidence'' to support the story.
George Washington was with his army in New York when he supposedly
met with Ross in her upholstery shop in June of 1776. Actually, the
first American flag used by the army is believed to be the
``Bennington Flag,'' first carried into battle in 1777, with 9
stripes and 13 stars over the number 76. Betsy Ross did make flags
_ just not the famous ``Stars and Stripes.'' ``In May 1777, the
Pennsylvania State Navy Board paid Betsy Ross almost 15 pounds for
making `ships colors &AMP; c.'''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Teratologist  &LR;  Although most people might be unfamiliar with
the occupation (a student of ``biological monstrosities and
malformations''), they know Virginia Apgar for the scale _ or Apgar
score _ that she developed in 1952 to test the health of newborn
children. It remains the world's standard assessment. The first
American to hold a faculty position devoted to the study of
congential disorders, she can also be found on the 20-cent stamp.

TALKING STYLE, CULTURE AND ALL THAT JAZZ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Dec. 13)  
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM GRIMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If anyone could have made sense of the doings at the
Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum last Thursday, it was Eve, the top
half of Brancusi's wooden sculpture ``Adam and Eve.'' With African
features, a Hebrew name and a French-Romanian creator, she touched
more cultural bases than a Benetton advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   What better emblem for the museum's new exhibition,
``Rendezvous: Masterpieces from the Centre Georges Pompidou and the
Guggenheim Museums,'' and for a fizzy panel discussion dedicated to
the proposition that art, design, fashion, television and
everything else were converging into one huge fabulous cultural goo
ball.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Juliet Buck, the editor in chief of French Vogue, served as
ringmistress for the discussion. A bouncy woman with a barking
laugh, she fired questions at Andree Putman, the interior designer;
Suzanne Slesin, the interior-design editor of House &AMP; Garden, and
Michael Kors, the fashion designer. A very tony museum-fund-raiser
audience _ including the likes of Carolina Herrera, Mica Ertegun,
Diane Von Furstenberg and Kenneth Jay Lane _ listened.
</P>
<P>
   Amorphously titled ``A Celebration of Style,'' the symposium may
have been related to ``Rendezvous,'' which parades the major
artistic styles of the 20th century along the Guggenheim's spiral
catwalk, or it may have been attached to the Guggenheim Museum
SoHo's French-American show, a theory-laden exercise fetchingly
called ``Premises: Invested Spaces in Visual Arts, Architecture and
Design From France: 1958-98.''
</P>
<P>
   But who could tell? Maybe the topic had more to do with a
$12,000 Cartier watch that was given away as a door prize after
lunch, and the chorus line of jewel-bedecked models in white cat
suits who circulated among the tables. As Thomas Krens, the
Guggenheim's director, reminded the audience: ``Culture is no
longer a narrow thing. It's not just painting and sculpture. It's
about everything that contributes to the texture of everyday
life.''
</P>
<P>
   And how. Krens does not just talk the talk. This is the man who
this year opened the museum to ``Show,'' a performance in which 20
professional models teetering on stiletto-heel Guccis and wearing
either rhinestone Gucci G-strings or nothing at all, stood and did
nothing for three hours. Krens has led the way in inviting
sizzling-hot talents like Gae Aulenti and Frank Gehry to install
exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   It was Ms. Putman, recovered from her labors designing Morgans
Hotel, who did the installation for ``Rendezvous.'' Think of the
Guggenheim not as an austere temple of modernism, but as Thomas
Krens' House of Style.
</P>
<P>
   All parties agreed that a millennial mega-convergence of
cultural languages and styles has arrived, and that interior design
and fashion, in particular, seemed to be infatuated with each
other, whipped on by a fashion and design press that has speeded up
the trend cycle and created a picky, very impatient customer
population.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have gotten smarter,'' said Kors, a militantly casual
figure in chinos, a black sweatshirt and black laced shoes with no
socks. ``They look in the mirror, stamp their feet and say, `Skip
it, I'm not going there,' although we do still have people dressed
like cakes and things like that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Putman, a regal figure who spoke in a Lauren Bacall
baritone, limited her remarks to a series of deadpan aphorisms.
``There are no more fashion victims, and there used to be tons of
them,'' she said. ``Now there are only design victims.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes, said Ms. Buck, dressed like a one-woman manifesto for
gray as the new black. ``Design is hard,'' she said. ``Fashion is
easy, because it's based on your body.''
</P>
<P>
   Easy for the customer, perhaps, but hard for the fashion
business, Kors said, lamenting the now almost invisible gap between
the emergence of a trend and its descent into cliche. Like gray as
the new black.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Buck flinched. ``Don't say you're sick of gray,'' she
protested. ``Not today.''
</P>
<P>
   With ``Rendezvous'' perhaps in the panelists' minds, the
dialogue between French and American style loomed large in the
discussion. Ms. Putman found it cheering that the French seemed to
be breaking free of ``the Versailles syndrome'' _ the national
impulse to invoke Louis XIV when decorating their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Like a solvent, American culture, especially American
television, has been melting the thick patina of traditional French
style. Ms. Buck noted that French mothers are now as likely to name
their daughters Tiffany as Marianne, and in style matters, French
youth seem to waver between South Central Los Angeles and the San
Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the biggest influence on the French view of themselves
is the set designers in Burbank who create those television
shows,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kors nodded emphatically. ``French people used to tell me,
`You're so American, so casual.' So when I went to France, I
expected to see women in pink mink suits walking pink poodles.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't quite like that. Shopping is still a languorous
seduction in France, in sharp contrast to the 20-minute quickie
that prevails in New York, he said. But Kors did see evidence of
the backward-looking impulse when he arrived in Paris a year ago to
take over as the designer for Celine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had people in the atelier who had never seen anyone wearing
shower clogs on the street,'' he said, genuinely appalled. France
still has much work to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``France is the 40-watt bulb,'' Ms. Buck said. ``America is the
100-watt bulb, if not the three-way bulb.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a point she was not willing to let go. Why, she asked
Ms. Putman, did France not have the three-way bulb?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Putman gave the matter some thought. ``I believe we invented
the dimmer,'' she said.

 &HT;    Month after Mitch, misery lives on in Honduras shelters

   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras _ It's been well more than a month since
Hurricane Mitch walloped Central America.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the storm's wrath didn't end with the rains for the
shell-shocked people packed like animals inside an emergency
shelter at the Leovigildo Cardona Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   In one tiny classroom, a very pregnant Aida Celeste sleeps on a
piece of cardboard, without a pillow, on the cold, cement floor.
</P>
<P>
   She shares the damp space, which is marked off by desks, boxes
and stacks of old clothes, with at least a dozen strangers.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to relief workers, she has all the tins of tuna fish and
cans of green beans she could possibly ever want.
</P>
<P>
   Now what she really needs is money to rebuild her makeshift
house, swallowed by a mudslide during the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't take anything with me when my house fell down; I just
ran for my life,'' said Celeste, 23, a shy, soft-spoken woman with
a 2-year-old son. ``I sit here each day with my son, wondering if I
will ever have a place to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Her predicament is all too common.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Mitch meandered over Honduras and neighboring
Nicaragua, for nearly six days in late October, destroying or
damaging tens of thousands of homes and leaving displaced nearly 2
million people, or 40 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Most are holed up in the unaffected houses of family and
friends.
</P>
<P>
   But more than 200,000 people have been herded into temporary
shelters, mostly in schools, but also in churches and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   In Tegucigalpa alone, at least 20,000 people have been squeezed
into the close confines of 130 shelters, where they live in almost
unbearable conditions, with no privacy.
</P>
<P>
   In San Pedro Sula, the country's second-largest city, thousands
have been packed into the new soccer stadium, which has been turned
into a refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
   Cramped quarters force healthy people to live alongside sick
ones suffering from rashes, infections and conjunctivitis, and
women must sleep beside men they hardly know.
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure what will happen once many of these shelters are
closed in January to prepare for the beginning of school in
February.
</P>
<P>
   Relief workers worry that absolute poverty -- no home, no income
-- will give these people little choice but to live on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some shelters, men who don't belong there have come in and
tried to rape the girls,'' said Brenda Martinez, who works for
CARE, an Atlanta-based relief organization. ``I don't think anyone
has succeeded, but it is just not a good situation for the women.''
</P>
<P>
   The Honduran government, with the help of foreign aid, plans
over the short-term to build at least 3,000 new homes in and around
Tegucigalpa, the country's capital city.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not nearly enough to accommodate the country's legion
of homeless, meaning it may take years before many lives return to
normal.
</P>
<P>
   At the shelter at the Jorge Roberto Maradiaga Elementary School
here, Paula Valladares, 23, shares a cot and one blanket with her
three children, ages 5, 3 and 1, while her husband sleeps on the
floor beside them.
</P>
<P>
   They live with three other families in a dingy classroom that's
no bigger than a living room in a typical home in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   They hang a torn bedspread from the ceiling when they want to
discreetly change clothes, and heat rice and beans over an open
fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to make tortillas and then sell them for money, but now
I don't have any materials to make tortillas,'' said Valladares,
who wears one of the few garments she owns, a flimsy, see-through
nightgown. ``My husband is trying to do some construction work, but
I don't know how we will find money to build a house.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, they have no choice but to remain at the school, which
provides shelter to more than 120 other people.
</P>
<P>
   With no electricity or running water, the smell from six
overflowing toilets is almost suffocating.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, relief workers deliver several barrels of water to
the shelter weekly.
</P>
<P>
   Women wash their mostly tattered clothing by hand, hanging it on
ropes to dry in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   In the courtyard, dozens of children, many wearing only
flip-flops and oversized T-shirts, chase each other and toss a ball
back and forth, seemingly oblivious to their surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   Babies crawl at their feet, most with runny noses and no
diapers.
</P>
<P>
   Their parents, on the other hand, look dazed as they sit on the
ground swapping stories for the umpteenth time about the torrential
downpour that attacked like a biblical plague.
</P>
<P>
   ``The walls of my house started cracking, and it was nighttime,
so it was dark, but still I just knew that the house was going to
fall down,'' said Olga Vaquis, 22. ``I grabbed my two children out
of bed and just started running, and it was muddy and, we fell, but
we just kept going because we were scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the families are from Colonia Soto, a working-class
neighborhood overlooking the Choluteca River that virtually buckled
under the weight of the rains.
</P>
<P>
   Before the storm, the community included 800 homes. Today, there
are fewer than 50.
</P>
<P>
   Already the second-poorest country in the Western Hemisphere,
after Haiti, Honduras bore the brunt of Hurricane Mitch, which
killed 10,000 people across Central America.
</P>
<P>
   At least 5,657 people are dead, 8,058 are missing, and 12,272
are injured in the Honduras alone.
</P>
<P>
   Total losses are estimated at $4 billion -- or roughly the gross
domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 72 hours, we lost what we had built, little by little, in
50 years,'' said Honduran President Carlos Flores Facusse.
</P>
<P>
   Food and supplies have poured in from around the world, so much
so that relief workers now warn that it could destroy the local
market.
</P>
<P>
   More goods have been flown in to Central America than during the
Berlin Airlift of 1948, when the United States was forced to drop
food from airplanes when the Soviets blocked the German city at the
beginning of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government, which has sent more than 3,600 troops to
Central America to help distribute supplies and rebuild
infrastructure, has handed out 2.3 million pounds of food and
863,000 pounds of medicine in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. aid to the region now totals more than $280 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly the best way to have an immediate impact now is to
give a cash contribution because it can be directed toward the most
urgent needs, such as providing permanent housing for all those
people who need it,'' said Mark Schneider, assistant administrator
for Latin America for the U.S. Agency for International Development
in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment was echoed by actor-activist Edward James Olmos,
who spent five days touring the devastation in Honduras last month.
``I've helped after Hurricane

   Andrew and other disasters, but this was the worst thing I've
ever seen,'' said Olmos, a spokesman for UNICEF. ``We have 20 to 30
years of work to do in Honduras to get that country back to where
it was just six weeks ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tegucigalpa, a city of 1.3 million, appears
deceptively normal these days, at least on the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Burger Kings are bustling with customers, and Nissan dealerships
are overflowing with crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Water service has been restored to many neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   But the cliff-like hills that ring the city look like they've
been blasted by a bomb, with houses replaced by piles of mud,
stones and scattered tiles.
</P>
<P>
   Nestled in a bowl-shaped valley, poor migrants for years have
built settlements on steep mountains when they couldn't afford
flatter, safer land.
</P>
<P>
   They've destroyed trees and vegetation to have building sites,
fuel to cook with and construction supplies.
</P>
<P>
   When the storm hit, the rains triggered landslides along the
deforested hills, gobbling up everything in their paths.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent a recurrence of this tragedy, a new law has been
passed that prohibits the rebuilding of houses in dangerous zones.
</P>
<P>
   But it remains to be seen how well this rule can be carried out
in a country where so many people are eager to build homes.
</P>
<P>
   One person who might have helped was Mayor Cesar Castellanos,
who worked for years to move people out of unstable areas but was
killed in a helicopter crash last month while surveying the
hurricane's damage.
</P>
<P>
   Many businesses and nonprofit groups plan to help with
reconstruction efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Home Depot, for example, has given CARE a credit
of $10,000 for building materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is going to be a hard, long-term effort because we
have to create whole new communities, since we can't put people
back where they were,'' said Marc de Lamotte, CARE's director in
Honduras. ``Meanwhile, I ask myself whether I would be able to live
with my family in a shelter under such poor conditions, and I
really don't think I could.''

   Eliza Petrescu, an eyebrow designer, doesn't stand on ceremony,
or even bother with hello. ``We are going to have to let those
eyebrows grow!'' she said, greeting a new client who seemed to be
expecting a more genial ``good morning.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, eyebrow grooming as practiced by Ms. Petrescu is not
for the faint of heart. She can strip, pluck and prune brows to
bonsai perfection in seven minutes flat. For that skill, clients
are willing to overlook a manner that can be as sharp as her
flashing metal tweezers.
</P>
<P>
   On a sunny morning recently _ Ms. Petrescu's first at the newly
opened Avon Centre Spa in Trump Tower _ anxious women passed
through her wax-sticky fingers at an alarming clip. Ms. Petrescu
had been on vacation since defecting from the John Barrett Salon a
month earlier, and her followers had been getting shaggy.
</P>
<P>
   She sees 40 to 60 people a day, with a celebrity roster that
includes Jennifer Grey, Madonna, Vanessa Redgrave, Natasha
Richardson and Ms. Richardson's husband, Liam Neeson. She also
plucks fashion editors and models and pays house calls on
socialites like Denise Rich. New clients often wait three months
for a 10-minute appointment. The smart ones book monthly visits a
year in advance.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of hot wax, curved scissors and a pair of
tweezers, Ms. Petrescu, an energetic former accountant who
emigrated from Romania in 1981, is capable of giving arch to a brow
that's as flat as the plains, or shadowing in a meager line. She
can compensate for lopsidedness caused by plastic surgery, or
advise on subtle matters of coloration. (Lighter hair, she
maintains, demands brows that are a shade darker.) She can make a
long face fuller or a round face thinner, and can open up eyes that
have been hooded for years.
</P>
<P>
   And she is fair in her tyranny, scolding the bushy and the bald
alike if they tamper at home with her work.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Petrescu, 46, who has been compared to both a pussycat and
Saddam Hussein, makes no apologies for being an eyebrow bully. ``I
am strict,'' she said, her manner as crisp as her lab coat. ``I
know best. Why should I discuss what a client wants with her? When
you go to a doctor, you don't tell him how to treat you. It's the
same. I know about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Clients put up with Ms. Petrescu's dictates because she is no
ordinary aesthetician. ``I've been going to her for years,'' Ms.
Richardson said. ``Now I'm addicted. Having had people take off
half my eyebrow in one quick rip, I know how easy it is to do it
badly. But she's fast, and she takes her work very seriously. She's
simply the best.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why, on Ms. Petrescu's first day at the Avon Centre _
which began, as all her workdays do, at 7:45 a.m. _ there was
palpable relief in the air. ``Oh, thank God I found you!'' said one
customer, a wine importer, who declined to be named lest her
employer discover her real motive for visiting midtown at midday.
``I had to call four different people to track you down, but you're
back. That's all that matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Petrescu smiled tightly. ``Did you touch your eyebrows while
I was away?'' she asked in accented English, peering down at the
woman's forehead with raptorlike intensity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you kidding?'' the woman answered, laughing nervously. ``I
did nothing. Like I want to get yelled at?''
</P>
<P>
   To stay on her good side, clients woo her with flowers, theater
tickets, and baskets of fancy food. One woman even stationed
herself on the street outside the Avon Centre while it was still
under construction, hoping to speak to someone who could assure her
that the appointments she made at Ms. Petrescu's former salon would
be honored at the new salon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't easy getting in here,'' said Lauren Malis, who works
for the state Economic Development Department, after being
upbraided by Ms. Petrescu for plucking out two hairs deemed crucial
to the arch of her left brow. ``But when I have my eyebrows done,
people really think I look different. They don't know why, but they
notice.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a podiatrist who sees his patients in terms of their feet,
Ms. Petrescu is a miniaturist, perceiving the spectrum of human
types through the fur above their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see personalities in a woman's eyebrows,'' she said
while making corrections on a client whose eyebrows were thin and
uneven. ``When they overpluck, they are nervous. When they have
hair everywhere, it means they are laid back. When I see a
manicured brow, I see a balanced person.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a good eyebrow,'' she continued, brushing and
trimming a new client, ``you don't even need much makeup. What I
look at is the distance between the brows, the shape of the arch,
and the end of the brow. I keep it natural, but also clean and
elongated. It's all about the geometry of the face. You have to
have an eye for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her geometry lessons aren't cheap. She charges $60 for an
initial shaping, $34 for return visits. Some patrons complain of a
hidden cost. ``It hurt like hell!'' said one, reached by telephone,
who asked not to be named for fear she might not be given another
appointment. ``Afterwards, there were tears streaming down my face,
and when Eliza saw me crying she just said, `Oh, the little baby's
crying.'
</P>
<P>
   ``She was half joking, but the weirdness of it all struck me. I
mean, this person _ I didn't know she was famous then _ was very
brusque. She made fun of me. But it made a huge difference to the
way I look. I would actually do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy Taran Astley, the beauty editor at Vogue, said Ms.
Petrescu's highhandedness is not unusual in her field. ``All
high-profile beauty people behave like that,'' she said. ``Eliza
can be forceful. But you do look better afterwards, so I think
women feel it's worth it.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Imagining the brief celebrity he might achieve if he
showed up on ``Baywatch,'' Neal Thomas, a New York banker, leaped
into the bidding at a charity auction for the Franciscan Sisters of
the Poor Foundation last week at Mickey Mantle's Restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   On the block was a walk-on part on the television show, which
concerns itself with lifeguards and skimpy beach wear. ``Maybe
they'll put me in a role where I'm a drowning victim,'' Thomas said
with excitement the day after he successfully clinched the part for
$2,300. ``Maybe they'll get a shot of me with water blowing out of
my nose.''
</P>
<P>
   While he is eager to have his family and friends catch his
close-up when it is shown sometime next season, he was not certain
he really wanted to display himself in a bathing suit. ``I'm not
exactly in the best shape,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it means putting on a Speedo for ``Baywatch'' or lying
there like a corpse for ``General Hospital,'' a cameo television
appearance is just one of the fantasy moments now tempting bidders
at charity auctions.
</P>
<P>
   As the fund-raising season reaches its height, the question is
not what's for sale for a good cause, but whether anything isn't _
from a wild-boar hunt in France to an arctic mountain-climbing
expedition to a date in Paris with Claudia Schiffer and some of her
supermodel friends.
</P>
<P>
   At last week's fund-raiser for the Franciscan sisters, which was
also held to benefit the Brooklyn Sports Foundation, an audience
with the pope was on the block as well.
</P>
<P>
   With some six fund-raising auctions a week this month in New
York alone, charities have to compete hard to capture donors and
dollars. And so increasingly, organizers are replacing traditional
goods with exotic or extraordinary experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Some gimmicks are more gritty than glamorous: Earlier this year,
the Nightingale-Bamford School in Manhattan offered an insider's
visit to a Manhattan criminal court to watch a trial and meet the
judge.
</P>
<P>
   And in the Seattle area, a popular auction item is a trip to
Alaska on a Totem Ocean Trailer Express cargo ship as the only
guest, with the crew and containers full of livestock and lumber.
(Next chance is in March, to benefit the St. Andrew's Housing Group
in Bellevue, Wash.)
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, of future ``Baywatch'' fame, said he was just looking
for a good excuse to contribute to the building of an amateur
sports complex in Coney Island, his old neighborhood. But the
offbeat items on the block had him splurging. In addition to buying
his big moment on ``Baywatch,'' he spent $600 for three rounds with
a professional boxer, Kathy Collins, at a Long Island gym.
</P>
<P>
   ``A charity auction is almost like a television game show _ it's
got to be entertaining and original,'' said Christopher Hartop, the
director of specialist departments for Christie's in New York and a
charity and commercial auctioneer for the last 20 years.
``Sometimes organizers think we must get expensive things and make
it like a serious art auction, but they never seem to be as
successful as the ones that are just fun.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Robin Hood Foundation, an educational and social-services
charity in New York City, celebrity benefactors make its auctions
among the most spectacular in town. Last June, one bidder bought
visits to the New York and Milan fashion shows, four designer
outfits and a private dinner with Giorgio Armani for $160,000. Bids
for a lunch with Ms. Schiffer, Elle MacPherson and Naomi Campbell
closed at $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger Woods was in the audience, and he was bidding feverishly
for it,'' said David Saltzman, executive director of the
foundation. ``But he lost out to a guy from Merrill Lynch.''
</P>
<P>
   Also for the Robin Hood Foundation, Ronald Perelman, the
chairman of Revlon, successfully offered $100,000 for a lesson with
the hockey legend Wayne Gretzky, as well as a trip to a closed
practice and introductions to members of the team. (Perelman is
donating the lesson to New York City schoolchildren.)
</P>
<P>
   Celebrities are unpredictable commodities, however. When the
Association to Benefit Children, in New York, offered a play date
in the park with Mia Farrow and some of her children in 1992, they
couldn't anticipate that the Woody Allen and Soon-Yi Previn
relationship would go public before the auction. Rather than cancel
the item, organizers let it go to the block. Of course, the scandal
only added to its value. The fierce bidding reached $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   The benefit-auction tradition dates to the Victorian era, but it
has become a fund-raising staple only since the early 1970s.
Special-events experts say its popularity in New York dates from
1971, when the Lenox Hill Neighborhood Association offered a
half-interest in a horse belonging to Charles Engelhard, a
multimillionaire owner of thoroughbreds.
</P>
<P>
   Now such auctions have spread throughout the United States. And
prepackaged action adventures often command top bids. On the West
Coast, mock dogfights in military-style aircraft are a hot ticket.
You can snag an hour in an Italian-made fighter plane and conduct
midair attack maneuvers, complete with fake smoke and real nose
dives. ``They teach you how to make a kill,'' said Kip Toner, a
charity auctioneer in Seattle who hawks dozens of dogfights each
year.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Hand, a Seattle tax lawyer, said he bid about $1,000 for
his chance to co-pilot a fighter plane at an auction for his
children's private school, the University Preparatory Academy in
Seattle. ``It was great,'' he said, after exchanging air fire with
a petrified-looking woman in the next plane.

</P>
<P>
   Dan Ortolani, who organizes fund-raisers for Grenville Christian
College, in the Thousand Islands region of Canada, recently
auctioned a hiking trip above the Arctic Circle on Baffin Island to
four bidders for $25,000 apiece. There were rifles on hand in case
of polar-bear attack, and the group did the 20-hour climb in a
single day. ``We sort of stumbled comatose down the mountain,'' he
said. ``But we did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even people who aren't thrill seekers can be tempted by the
allure of a dangerous expedition when they hear ``Going, going
....''
</P>
<P>
   At the Landon School in Bethesda, Md., Patti and Bruce Mackey
found themselves the winners of the wild-boar hunt in the French
countryside, even though the pair prefer blood-free vacations.
After arriving, Ms. Mackey said, they were offered a stag hunt
instead. On their own they peered into the woods for some boar but
saw none. They happily went antiquing instead.
</P>
<P>
   Not all items require steely resolve and foul-weather gear. In
New York, benefit-goers can bid on a touch of immortality. At an
Authors Guild auction in the city last year, the novelist Barbara
Taylor Bradford agreed to write the name of the highest bidder into
her next book.
</P>
<P>
   That is how the name Dina Zuckerberg achieved its cameo mention
in Mrs. Bradford's ``A Sudden Change of Heart,'' due out in
February. The character is a career woman who orders pizza for a
dinner party. ``I thought Dina Zuckerberg was a good name,'' said
Mrs. Bradford, who plans to do this again in February for the New
York charity Literacy Partners.
</P>
<P>
   Can there be anything left to top these items on the block?
Ortolani at Grenville Christian College is planning a Mount
Kilimanjaro climb on New Year's Eve, 2000, complete with a
documentary on the bidders who make the mission. ``You better bring
your credit card,'' he warned. ``This one won't come cheap.''

 &HT;    WILL MICROSOFT SETTLE ITS ANTITRUST CASE?
 &HT;    With MICROSOFT-FELTEN. Moving in (w) Washington and (f)
financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Will Microsoft Corp. settle its quarrel with the
antitrust police before U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
gets to rule on the historic civil suit next spring?
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the large ads Microsoft placed recently in several
newspapers, you wouldn't think the battle is near an end. Headlined
``Leave it to the Marketplace,'' the ads quote economists and
editorials opposed to prosecuting the landmark case.
</P>
<P>
   Still, developments in court could induce the battling parties
to strike a deal. The pressure to compromise stems not only from
events in the marketplace, but also the software giant's vision of
how it seeks to evolve its successful monopoly franchise for
personal computer operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft spokesman Mark Murray said the ads were needed to
counter ``news leaks'' from the government about the trial, due to
enter its ninth week on Monday. But save for a few sealed
documents, the trial has been held entirely in the open. In truth,
what Murray was alluding to was the government's conviction that
the case was going their way.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every day that court convenes, Joel Klein, the
government's chief antitrust enforcer, strolls down Pennsylvania
Avenue from his Justice Department office to the federal
courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Behind a phalanx of lawyers, Klein sits on a hard wooden bench
as the testimony unfolds. Klein has shared his upbeat outlook on
the proceedings with a few aides. But his views have seeped out,
creating a strong impact on the defense team.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's billed as the technological legal showdown of the
century, all the key participants remain quite chummy. They trade
jokes during the breaks and even meet for dinner on some evenings.
David Boies, the government's chief litigator, and John Warden, his
Microsoft counterpart, have previously worked together on the
antitrust circuit. Back in Bedford, N.Y., they are friends and
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, while a distant videotaped
visage, is nevertheless fully attuned to the atmosphere in the
courtroom. Twice a day, he is briefed on developments by William
Neukom, Microsoft's general counsel, and by Tod Nielsen,
Microsoft's general manager for outside developer relations.
</P>
<P>
   According to Boies, it was Gates himself who intervened last May
to block a last-minute settlement, against the advice of Neukom,
who has been Microsoft's top lawyer since its founding in 1975, and
that of Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell, Microsoft's Wall Street litigators.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Jackson, a decisive figure who has sat on the federal
bench since 1982, has sent mixed signals on how may rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has tipped his hand,'' holds William Kovacic, a visiting
professor of antitrust law at George Washington University Law
School. ``The government is going to win at the trial level. It is
not clear by how much, but I think this judge is going to find a
violation and impose some kind of remedy.''
</P>
<P>
   To buttress Kovacic's view, when Jackson questioned Avadis
Tevanian, an Apple Computer Inc. executive, on Nov. 5 about whether
integrating an Internet browser into the Windows operating system
provided any technical benefits, Jackson's points seemed mapped to
the government's position.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson startled the courtroom last Thursday by suggesting
to James Gosling, Sun Microsystems Inc.'s chief scientist, that Sun
had moved too slowly to counter innovations by an industry leader
in what remains a highly competitive environment. That's precisely
what Microsoft had contended during four days of its
cross-examination, spread over two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping both sides unsure of where he really stands, the
stocky 61-year-old judge raises the chances for an out-of-court
bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Recent business pressures point the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Last month's move by America Online Inc. to absorb Netscape
Communications Corp. _ a deal that included new business for Sun _
seemingly weakened the case against Microsoft. ``In an industry
where (this) $4.2 billion merger ...can change the competitive
landscape overnight, why is there any need for government
intervention?'' Microsoft asks in its ad.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft was also caught off guard in September when, with
Jackson's assent, the government amplified its original complaint
from a thrust against the bundling of the Internet Explorer browser
into Windows 98 into a wide-ranging action that alleges a
systematic pattern of misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft officials privately admit that they once had a
``bulletproof'' bulwark against the government: They have already
sold some 15 million copies of Windows 98. In each of them, the
browser is technologically baked into the cake and cannot be
removed, no matter what the court should decide.
</P>
<P>
   But next spring, Microsoft plans to roll out Office 2000, a
suite of highly useful programs that, judging by the public
``beta'' release, would forever blur all lines among Windows, the
browser and the suite of major applications.
</P>
<P>
   Office 2000's premium package bundles new versions of every
major business program that Microsoft now markets, including its
word processor, spreadsheet, database, e-mail client and an image
editor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Office 2000 is so deeply intertwined with the (operating
system), test it only if you plan to reformat your hard disk
afterward'' in case software bugs cause a system crash, warns
Edward Mendelson, who previews the huge project for the Jan. 5
issue of PC Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Top Microsoft officials project that most personal computer
users won't require any additional software besides Windows and the
integrated Office suite. Because of this, they say, future software
developers will focus on networks and Internet services, such as
e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   They also know that if an integrated browser raised deep
concerns at the Justice Department, then a fully integrated
``applications system'' could trigger even louder alarm bells, both
there and in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But an early settlement could help clear a legal path for Office
2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the judge finds for the government, any remedy could not be
imposed by the court,'' Boies conceded in an interview. ``It would
have to be negotiated, top to bottom, with Microsoft, in order to
protect the interests of consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   How such at negotiation might proceed is still anybody's guess.
But imposing a hefty fine on a company with $17 billion in cash
won't make much of an impact, federal antitrust officials
acknowledge.
</P>
<P>
   And absent a settlement, Jackson is unlikely to favor creating a
U.S. Department of Microsoft, charged with regulating the company's
behavior to ensure that it competes fairly.
</P>
<P>
   As Stewart Alsop, a Silicon Valley investor, observes:
``Bureaucrats paid on a General Schedule have no incentive to make
quick decisions about a fast-moving technology. This would turn
Windows into an even worse product in the future, which is hard to
contemplate, since it's bad enough as it is.''
</P>
<P>
   By cutting a deal, Microsoft would avoid that nightmare, and
some others as well. Whether a deal will sprout still remains to be
seen. But the necessary seeds appear to have been planted.

to strike a deal. The pressure to compromise stems not only from
events in the marketplace, but also the software giant's vision of
how it seeks to evolve its successful monopoly franchise for
personal computer operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft spokesman Mark Murray said the ads were needed to
counter ``news leaks'' from the government about the trial, due to
enter its ninth week on Monday. But save for a few sealed
documents, the trial has been held entirely in the open. In truth,
what Murray was alluding to was the government's conviction that
the case was going their way.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every day that court convenes, Joel Klein, the
government's chief antitrust enforcer, strolls down Pennsylvania
Avenue from his Justice Department office to the federal
courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Behind a phalanx of lawyers, Klein sits on a hard wooden bench
as the testimony unfolds. Klein has shared his upbeat outlook on
the proceedings with a few aides. But his views have seeped out,
creating a strong impact on the defense team.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's billed as the technological legal showdown of the
century, all the key participants remain quite chummy. They trade
jokes during the breaks and even meet for dinner on some evenings.
David Boies, the government's chief litigator, and John Warden, his
Microsoft counterpart, have previously worked together on the
antitrust circuit. Back in Bedford, N.Y., they are friends and
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, while a distant videotaped
visage, is nevertheless fully attuned to the atmosphere in the
courtroom. Twice a day, he is briefed on developments by William
Neukom, Microsoft's general counsel, and by Tod Nielsen,
Microsoft's general manager for outside developer relations.
</P>
<P>
   According to Boies, it was Gates himself who intervened last May
to block a last-minute settlement, against the advice of Neukom,
who has been Microsoft's top lawyer since its founding in 1975, and
that of Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell, Microsoft's Wall Street litigators.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Jackson, a decisive figure who has sat on the federal
bench since 1982, has sent mixed signals on how may rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has tipped his hand,'' holds William Kovacic, a visiting
professor of antitrust law at George Washington University Law
School. ``The government is going to win at the trial level. It is
not clear by how much, but I think this judge is going to find a
violation and impose some kind of remedy.''
</P>
<P>
   To buttress Kovacic's view, when Jackson questioned Avadis
Tevanian, an Apple Computer Inc. executive, on Nov. 5 about whether
integrating an Internet browser into the Windows operating system
provided any technical benefits, Jackson's points seemed mapped to
the government's position.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson startled the courtroom last Thursday by suggesting
to James Gosling, Sun Microsystems Inc.'s chief scientist, that Sun
had moved too slowly to counter innovations by an industry leader
in what remains a highly competitive environment. That's precisely
what Microsoft had contended during four days of its
cross-examination, spread over two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping both sides unsure of where he really stands, the
stocky 61-year-old judge raises the chances for an out-of-court
bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Recent business pressures point the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Last month's move by America Online Inc. to absorb Netscape
Communications Corp. _ a deal that included new business for Sun _
seemingly weakened the case against Microsoft. ``In an industry
where (this) $4.2 billion merger ...can change the competitive
landscape overnight, why is there any need for government
intervention?'' Microsoft asks in its ad.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft was also caught off guard in September when, with
Jackson's assent, the government amplified its original complaint
from a thrust against the bundling of the Internet Explorer browser
into Windows 98 into a wide-ranging action that alleges a
systematic pattern of misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft officials privately admit that they once had a
``bulletproof'' bulwark against the government: They have already
sold some 15 million copies of Windows 98. In each of them, the
browser is technologically baked into the cake and cannot be
removed, no matter what the court should decide.
</P>
<P>
   But next spring, Microsoft plans to roll out Office 2000, a
suite of highly useful programs that, judging by the public
``beta'' release, would forever blur all lines among Windows, the
browser and the suite of major applications.
</P>
<P>
   Office 2000's premium package bundles new versions of every
major business program that Microsoft now markets, including its
word processor, spreadsheet, database, e-mail client and an image
editor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Office 2000 is so deeply intertwined with the (operating
system), test it only if you plan to reformat your hard disk
afterward'' in case software bugs cause a system crash, warns
Edward Mendelson, who previews the huge project for the Jan. 5
issue of PC Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Top Microsoft officials project that most personal computer
users won't require any additional software besides Windows and the
integrated Office suite. Because of this, they say, future software
developers will focus on networks and Internet services, such as
e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   They also know that if an integrated browser raised deep
concerns at the Justice Department, then a fully integrated
``applications system'' could trigger even louder alarm bells, both
there and in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But an early settlement could help clear a legal path for Office
2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the judge finds for the government, any remedy could not be
imposed by the court,'' Boies conceded in an interview. ``It would
have to be negotiated, top to bottom, with Microsoft, in order to
protect the interests of consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   How such at negotiation might proceed is still anybody's guess.
But imposing a hefty fine on a company with $17 billion in cash
won't make much of an impact, federal antitrust officials
acknowledge.
</P>
<P>
   And absent a settlement, Jackson is unlikely to favor creating a
U.S. Department of Microsoft, charged with regulating the company's
behavior to ensure that it competes fairly.
</P>
<P>
   As Stewart Alsop, a Silicon Valley investor, observes:
``Bureaucrats paid on a General Schedule have no incentive to make
quick decisions about a fast-moving technology. This would turn
Windows into an even worse product in the future, which is hard to
contemplate, since it's bad enough as it is.''
</P>
<P>
   By cutting a deal, Microsoft would avoid that nightmare, and
some others as well. Whether a deal will sprout still remains to be
seen. But the necessary seeds appear to have been planted.

SCHROEDER GOVERNMENT'S DIRECTNESS A DEPARTURE FROM POSTWAR GERMAN
ERAS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROGER COHEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ After assuring its allies that it represents
continuity, the new government of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder is
using a bold, often challenging directness that is a radical
departure from other postwar German administrations.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the unquestioning solidarity with a European Union seen
as the guarantor of German stability, the reluctance to challenge
NATO on basic points of doctrine and the deference to the United
States that reflected both a historic debt and an enduring sense of
vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   In their place Schroeder has bitterly attacked what he called
Germany's unfairly high contributions to a wasteful European Union
budget. Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer has suggested that NATO
change its nuclear policies. And Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine
has made clear that American-style global capitalism is not to his
taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strange sounds can be heard from Germany these days,'' the
influential Munich newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung said on its
editorial page this week. ``Where is Fischer's humility toward our
big American ally? Where are Schroeder and Lafontaine's
consideration and sensitivity toward their European partners?
Where, in fact, is the feeling for history?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer, perhaps, is that Germany's feeling for history has
shifted with the arrival in power of a new generation that, as
Schroeder has said, believes that the country should show ``the
self-confidence of a nation that has come of age.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the government's directness is a refreshing
liberation, a breath of fresh air for Germany's ponderous political
culture. Young Germans, particularly, felt stifled in the latter
years of Schroeder's predecessor, Helmut Kohl, and many are
enthusiastic about the new government's freewheeling style.
</P>
<P>
   But the shock to the United States, and to European allies
gathered Friday for a summit meeting in Vienna, has been palpable.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the government fails to realize is that when Germany
raises questions about NATO strategy, people raise questions about
Germany,'' said one Western official. ``They are begging us not to
make too much of Fischer's remarks, but the fact is he is not
building trust and he is causing irritation.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder's ``Red-Green'' coalition of Social Democrats and
Greens is still finding its feet, and there have been repeated
indications of confusion in the coalition's ranks. The ministers'
statements may be scattershot attempts to satisfy important party
constituencies as much as coordinated government policy.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer, for example, is facing a Green Party congress in
Leipzig this weekend, and his call for NATO to renounce the first
use of nuclear weapons is certain to go down well there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fischer warmed up a rather shallow green soup just enough to
let it bubble through the weekend,'' said one government official,
``but the coalition does not want to push this idea with any
lasting conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the follow-up to Fischer's stand, American
officials are concerned that his call for a review of nuclear
policy will prove a distraction as NATO grapples with other aspects
of redefining its post-Cold War mission.
</P>
<P>
   There is also widespread concern in Western capitals that
Schroeder appears unable or unready to assert his authority _
particularly over his bustling finance minister, Lafontaine _ and
so give a single voice to the coalition.
</P>
<P>
   But the Social Democratic chancellor seems determined to support
the various statements from his ministers. His consistent message
has been that Germany should no longer bear any complexes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today,'' Schroeder said last month, ``we are democrats and
Europeans, not because we have to be, but because we want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   In a speech this week about Germany's place in Europe, though,
he seemed to break startling new ground, adopting an almost
Thatcherite tone as he lambasted the European Union for draining
Germany's resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot and do not want to continue a policy that buys the
good will of our neighbors with net payments that will become a
burden to our country,'' Schroeder declared. ``We cannot solve
Europe's problems with the German checkbook.''
</P>
<P>
   His attack was focused on Germany's net contribution of $13.2
billion to the European Union budget, far more than those of other
countries, many of which receive large net payments every year in
the form of various subsidies. Why, Schroeder asked, should Germany
pay when rich countries like Luxembourg, Denmark and Belgium
receive money from the $100 billion European budget?
</P>
<P>
   The unspoken answer, for a long time, was precisely that Germany
should buy the good will of its neighbors and consider that
natural, because it had a historic debt to them and because the
European Union provided Germans with an environment in which to
grow rich again without appearing threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Several allies, including France, are certain to be troubled by
Schroeder's words, even as another ally, Britain, has been angered
by calls from Lafontaine for a harmonization of European tax levels
to reflect the imminent introduction of a European currency, the
euro.
</P>
<P>
   After a storm of protest in London, Lafontaine retreated a
little, calling for the ``coordination'' of taxes rather than their
``harmonization.'' Many in Britain see the latter term as a faint
disguise for the imposition of uncompetitive tax levels by the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
   But the German finance minister has stuck to calls for ``target
zones'' for international currencies and for greater controls in
what he has called the ``casino'' of international capitalism.
American officials, in general, have not been pleased.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder has offered measured support to Lafontaine, saying he
would work during Germany's approaching presidency of the Group of
Seven wealthy industrial nations for a ``financial architecture''
that ``should prevent entire economies being ruined by financial
speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   All this amounts to a marked change, but it was for change,
after all, that Germans voted 10 weeks ago. In the same article
that alluded to the ``strange sounds'' from Germany, Suddeutsche
Zeitung applauded the government's readiness to confront problems
long concealed behind ``facades of harmony.''
</P>
<P>
   But those facades, if that is what they were, also constituted
central elements in Germany's relations with its allies. Nobody
today believes that Germany is turning its back on America or the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
   But an adjustment of those relationships appears to be under
way, and it may eventually involve far-reaching shifts in the
European and trans-Atlantic order.

LEADERS AT EUROPE SUMMIT, SEEKING UNITY, REVERT TO SQUABBLING  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By CRAIG R. WHITNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA _ The European Union has always had grand plans, and
great trouble agreeing on how to carry them through.
</P>
<P>
   It will start a new common currency to rival the dollar on world
markets, the euro, next month. It has ambitions for a European
foreign and security policy, with military means to back it up.
</P>
<P>
   In the next decade, it intends to take in formerly Communist
countries, swelling membership from 15 nations to 20 or 25, with a
population and economy far larger than those of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But what leaders of this supposedly united Europe are doing at a
summit meeting here this weekend is squabbling, as they have been
for years, about how much expansion will cost. The argument is
about both money and the efficiency of procedures assuring vetoes
of the original three small members of the 1957 European Economic
Community _ Belgium, Luxembourg, Netherlands _ over decisions by
the original three large ones, Germany, France and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   France and Germany both agree that without changes to cumbersome
decision-making procedures, and to fat agricultural subsidies
designed when France was a weak agricultural economy and Germany
was a powerful industrial one, expansion will lead to political
paralysis and financial chaos.
</P>
<P>
   European leaders tried but failed to agree on change at a
similar meeting in Amsterdam in the summer of 1997. Now, on the eve
of the emergence of the euro, officials said Friday that the most
they expected to do here was to chart a course for more
negotiations and hope for a breakthrough by next March, when a
summit meeting is planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Willingness to compromise and concessions by all the member
states in all areas are absolutely necessary,'' President Jacques
Chirac of France and Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany agreed
before the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But if they meant that Prime Minister Tony Blair should consider
a cut in the British rebate from the European Union budget that
Margaret Thatcher negotiated for Britain in 1984, they were
disappointed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Blair made absolutely clear that Britain intended to keep every
penny of the rebate, which brought Britain's contribution to the
nearly $100 million European Union budget down by $2.4 billion this
year to $13.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is fair,'' he said as he arrived here. His spokesman,
Alistair Campbell, added, ``The point is, it is not negotiable.''
</P>
<P>
   And France itself has no intention of making any changes to the
$45 billion European agricultural support system that would require
it to pay subsidies out of its own national budget. The
agricultural policy now consumes nearly half the total European
budget.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union Executive Commission in Brussels has proposed
cuts of up to 30 percent in meat subsidies and 20 percent in grain
subsidies to farmers before a new round of talks next year with the
United States and other countries on agricultural policies.
</P>
<P>
   Even with those cuts and with member states taking over $5.85
billion of the costs of the agricultural policy, the Commission
predicts that its cost to the European Union will rise to nearly
$59 billion by 2006, after the first few Eastern European countries
come in.
</P>
<P>
   The system would become unworkable, the French agree, if changes
of some kind are not implemented before Poland, with tens of
thousands of inefficient small farms, becomes a member. But they
have pronounced the Commission's proposals unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Germany always ended up coughing up money that
France and other smaller, less wealthy states were unwilling to
provide. But Schroeder now says that it is highly unfair that
Germany pays 26 percent of the European Union budget, putting in
nearly $13 billion more than it gets back from Brussels in
agricultural, regional development and other European funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Germany is being asked to do too much if fairness in
contributions is not on the agenda,'' Schroeder said.
</P>
<P>
   As France's foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine put it recently,
``It looks insoluble.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, the European leaders had no choice but to try.
</P>
<P>
   Not all was gloomy as they met Friday in the vast and ornate
rooms of the Hofburg Palace, the seat of the vanished
Austro-Hungarian empire. The european commissioner for economics,
Yves-Thibault de Silguy, said that leaders this morning
congratulated themselves on having created 1.7 million jobs in
Europe in 1998, reducing the European-wide unemployment level to
just below 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And Europe, former Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany told the
leaders Friday, should only partly be about wrangling over which
countries should pay how much and how many Commissioners they
should be able to name to Brussels. More important, he said, should
be the political vision of Europe. The people in the east and
southeast of Europe expected the west to keep its promise to
recognize them, too, as a part of Europe, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders named Kohl ``Honorary Citizen of Europe'' at lunch
Friday in gratitude for his work toward European unity during the
16 years he was chancellor before Schroeder defeated him in
September. He thanked them but said he had no wish to be treated as
a monument.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what happens to monuments when the ceremony is
over,'' he said. ``The birds sit on them and do things.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite high pressure near the nation's capital, clouds will
spread across much of the middle Atlantic region on Saturday in
advance of a disturbance moving through the Southeast. While low
pressure forms along a front in the Gulf of Mexico, a jet-stream
disturbance in Arkansas will send a veil of high and middle clouds
from the southern Great Lakes to New Jersey. A chilly rain will
advance from the lower Tennessee Valley to the west-central
Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   Dull, cool weather is expected in the Southeast with showers
developing along the coast and in the mountains. More showers will
dampen the Gulf states from Alabama to Louisiana. A few
thunderstorms may form in mild air along the Gulf shores. Florida
will be partly to mostly cloudy and rather humid. A tropical
disturbance from the northwest Caribbean will trigger a few gusty
showers along the west coast.
</P>
<P>
   Low clouds and drizzle will persist from the Ozarks to the Red
River Valley. Fog will cover the western Gulf Coast as cool winds
blow in from the north. High pressure cresting over the central
Rockies will lead to some sun and warmer weather in the Plains.
Gusty winds from the west will boost readings to near-record levels
in eastern Montana and the western Dakotas, while cold air stays
trapped in the valleys of Utah and Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Rain and gales will resume in northwest Washington as a cold
front approaches. Clouds and showers will spread into western
Oregon and a surge of mild air will raise snow levels in the
Cascades. Meanwhile, much of the Southwest will be bright and
noticeably warmer.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Snowless Syracuse
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Syracuse, N.Y., were forgetting what snow looked
like. Finally, flakes fell on the city early Friday, accumulating
0.2 inches. This marks the latest the city has gone into the winter
season without snow. The unusually late start to the snow season
comes after the earliest end to the previous snow season. The last
time snow was measured in Syracuse, which boasts an average annual
snowfall of 114 inches, was on March 23. Hence, the city sustained
263 consecutive days without snow, which is the longest stretch
without snow since records began in 1902.

 &HT;    GOVERNMENT TEST KILLS MICROSOFT BROWSER

   WASHINGTON -- A forthcoming government witness at the Microsoft
Corp. antitrust trial has committed what the defendant in the
landmark case views as technological heresy by claiming in court
papers unsealed late Friday that he has found a safe way to remove
the built-in browser from Windows 98, Microsoft's flagship
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft does not provide any mechanism for removing its
browser from the system, Edward Felten, an assistant professor of
computer science at Princeton University, notes in his direct
testimony. In fact, users are repeatedly warned with desktop
messages never to attempt such a risky maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the help of two young assistants,'' Felten wrote, ``I
have developed a prototype removal program that demonstrates one
way Microsoft could have done this. Obviously, Microsoft, with its
more intimate knowledge of its own products, could likely find a
better way to accomplish the same result.''
</P>
<P>
   Felten is scheduled to be cross-examined on the witness stand by
Microsoft lawyers, beginning Monday, when the landmark trial enters
its ninth week.
</P>
<P>
   His testimony could prove vital to the case, particularly if
U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson supports the
government's claim that Microsoft has sought to leverage its
Windows monopoly to gain control of Internet browsing technology.
If the government prosecutors can show that the Microsoft browser
can be easily converted into a separate stand-alone product, its
effective range of remedies in the event of a conviction would be
expanded.
</P>
<P>
   In denying the government's claims, Microsoft argues that
Windows 98 and Internet Explorer share so many common functions
that they cannot be yanked apart without turning a personal
computer that runs on Windows into a useless hulk.
</P>
<P>
   Felten appended to his 28 pages of testimony an 11-page
technical appendix that explains, step-by-step, how the critical
binary surgery was performed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prototype removal program does not prevent Windows 98 from
booting properly, nor does it affect the stability of Windows 98
under ordinary use,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Felten said he planned to use on a 10-foot screen in the
courtroom to show a videotape that would illustrate how he managed
to oust Microsoft's default browser without a fatal crash.
</P>
<P>
   As Felten observes, the expulsion of Internet Explorer would
clear memory in the computer for the installation of competing
browser software, specifically, Netscape Communications Corp.'s
Navigator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I conclude from my study that Navigator can be installed on a
Windows PC that has IE Web browsing removed from it,'' Felten
wrote. A user who elects this combination of software will
experience the non-Web browsing benefits of Windows 98 and the
benefits of the Navigator, he claimed.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Microsoft issued a statement that said, in part,
that ``Dr. Felten does not testify that there is any practical way
to remove Internet Explorer 4 from Windows 98. Rather, he suggests
merely that with enough engineering effort, Windows 98 can be
redesigned so that customers cannot use its Web browsing software
to browse the Web ... Unlike the government, Microsoft is committed
to developing new software products that do more for customers, not
less.''

 &HT;    WILLIE NELSON HONORED AT 'WASHINGTON'S OSCARS'
 &HT;    620&AMP;add. For release Monday, Dec. 28.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attire for the Kennedy Center Honors is always
unflinchingly formal, so Willie Nelson arrived in a spiffy black
cowboy hat, shined black boots and black velvet binding the ends of
his braided reddish-gray hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember the last time'' he was so dressed up,
admitted the tuxedoed Texas troubador, who was among this year's
honorees. ``But they sent me a little piece of paper that said,
'You will wear black tie.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Along with Nelson, the Kennedy Center's 21st annual recognition
for lifetime achievement in the performing arts went to Bill Cosby,
Shirley Temple Black, conductor Andre Previn and Broadway composer
John Kander and lyricist Fred Ebb. The star-studded salute to the
honorees was videotaped Dec. 6 and will be broadcast on the CBS
television network on Wednesday (Dec. 30) at 9 p.m. EST.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes called ``Washington's Oscars,'' the Kennedy Center
Honors have recognized 111 American artists ranging from Bob Hope
and Lucille Ball to Paul Newman and Roy Acuff over the past two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   After hosting this year's honorees at a White House reception,
President Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton joined them
in box seats at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts
to watch a stage show recalling the winners' artistic careers.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Academy Awards, the evening begins with fans and TV
crews gathered on both sides of a red-carpeted foyer to see the
honorees and other celebrities walk from their limousines to their
theater seats. This promenade featured familiar faces from Capitol
Hill and Hollywood, including Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss., Dennis Hopper; Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.; Michelle Lee;
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and Jack Lemmon. Interesting
couples ranged from Dwight Yoakam and Bridget Fonda to Howard Baker
and Nancy Kassenbaum Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps only in Washington _ and certainly only in booming
economic times _ would some of the loudest applause go to Alan
Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. ``You da man,
Alan,'' shouted one onlooker as Greenspan passed, looking slightly
perplexed as he walked with his wife, NBC-TV correspondent Andrea
Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Cronkite anchored the gala, which featured a videotaped
recap of the achievements of each honoree and then salutes from
their performing peers.
</P>
<P>
   Known for his outlaw brand of country music, Nelson has had some
well-publicized run-ins with the law over marijuana and with the
IRS over unpaid taxes. On this night, though, a lyrical Cronkite
called him ``a Texan whose Dust Bowl voice and songs in the neon
night made him a Walt Whitman of our time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows who he is _ and he knows he's from someplace _ and he
knows where that place is,'' observed Tommy Lee Jones, a fellow
Texan. ``That big bus is always going back to the Hill Country.''
</P>
<P>
   On this night, though, Nelson's tour bus, the Honeysuckle Rose,
was rolled onto the reinforced Kennedy Center stage for the segment
honoring the Red-Haired Stranger. Then Nelson was serenaded with
his own songs.
</P>
<P>
   Yoakam sang ``Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain'' and ``Hello
Walls.'' Lyle Lovett sang ``Night Life.'' Shelby Lynne sang
``Crazy'' and provoked some nervous giggles in the audience when
the TV monitors showed the Clintons in their box listening to the
lyrics ``crazy for trying and crazy for crying and crazy for loving
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Kris Kristofferson strolled out, declaring ``Of all of
Willie's songs, this is probably the best epitaph'' and launching
into ``On the Road Again.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Nelson earlier told reporters he was taking his bus back
to Texas and might just drape his seven-ribboned Kennedy Center
Honors medal from the rear-view mirror.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   For this one evening, record producer Don Was put together ``The
Willie Nelson Tribute Band'' featuring himself on bass, Mickey
Raphael from Willie's ``Family'' on harmonica, G.E. Smith from
``Saturday Night Live'' and Reggie Young on guitar, Clifford Carter
on keyboards and Steve Jordan on guitar.
</P>
<P>
   Other highlights of the show include:
</P>
<P>
   _ A Broadway salute to Kander and Ebb featuring songs from two
of their top hits, ``Cabaret'' and ``Chicago.'' Bebe Neuwirth
(familiar as Lillith from ``Cheers'' and ``Frazier'') and Chita
Rivera dance and sing a ``Chicago'' medley and Joel Gray and Liza
Minelli reprise their ``Cabaret'' roles for a nostalgic number.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sinbad's hilarious rag on Cosby. On an evening of effusive
praise, Sinbad's outrageous tales of sharing a foxhole in Vietnam
with Cosby, saving his life and then being treated abominably by
the beloved comedian had Cosby pretending to climb out of his box
seat and later waving a white flag of surrender.
</P>
<P>
   _ A heartfelt tribute to Previn by Mia Farrow, his ex-wife.
``Thanks for the music, Toots, and for the memories,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cronkite recalled Shirley Temple Black from the era of the
Great Depression as ``a little child who lit up the screen, lifted
up the nation and will always be America's princess.'' Later, Jack
Lemmon added his deadpan salute: ``The first drink I ever had was a
Shirley Temple.'' And Henry Kissinger remembered being secretary of
state while the former child star served as U.S. ambassador to
Ghana. Growing up, he had her movies dubbed in German, Kissinger
said, ``so I was surprised when she spoke English _ and without an
accent.''
</P>
<P>
   The show concludes with a bemused Cronkite sharing a stage with
scores of tap-dancing kids as the U.S. Air Force Band plays ``On
the Good Ship Lollipop'' and hundreds of red, white and blue
balloons fall from the ceiling.

   IMPEACH-CLINTON _ WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, expressing
``shame'' and ``profound remorse'' for his extramarital affair,
said Friday for the first time he was ``ready to accept rebuke and

remarkable in the annals of presidential history, did not go far

impeachment. (Dart, Cox News Service).

   MIDEAST-STAKES _ JERUSALEM _ For Palestinians, Clinton's visit
is being billed as another sign of sovereignty. It helps Yasser
Arafat dress up the peace deal signed in Washington last month _ a
deal that is not terribly popular. For Israelis, it looks like
Clinton is getting too cozy with Arafat. They might regret _ and

rampage through Central America, leaving 11,000 people dead and
hundreds of thousands homeless. In Honduras alone, a country of 6
million people, more than 1 million have lost all of their worldly
possessions. The storm is gone, but reconstruction may take years.

   SMOKE _ After more than a year of legal wrangling over their
legal fees, the lawyers in Florida's tobacco lawsuit on Friday were
awarded exactly what they wanted in the first place: 25 percent of
the state's $12.7 billion settlement. And state officials also got
what they wanted, because the legal fees, which calculate to about
$3.4 billion on paper, will be paid by the tobacco industry.
Lawyers say they doubt they'll see all the money. As part of the
arbitration system, tobacco has agreed to pay just $500 million a
year toward legal fees. And after reaching a settlement with 46
states last month, that pool of money could be divided into many
slices of pie. (Hiaasen/Date/Waresh, Palm Beach Post). 35.

nation's tobacco settlements to determine what all attorneys will
get. That's more than the 15 percent they signed on for and $1
billion more than both Gov. Bush, Attorney Gen.-elect John Cornyn
and several lawmakers said was reasonable. We examine the decision,
get reaction and explain what happens next. (McCarthy, Austin

   CAMPUS-CRIME-SAFETY _ While investigating her children's college
choices, Georgia MacKowiak has asked college administrators about
campus safety. The 1998 Campus Security Act, signed by Clinton in
October, requires colleges and universities to make more i
information available about campus security. The Department of
Education is writing regulations to implement it and parents have

   TEXAS-JEWS _ Guacamole gracing the Passover plate, spurs for
making unleavened bread, and peddlers selling bananas are pieces of
Texas history not generally recorded in the annals of the Mexican
territory, the Republic and the state. This is Texas' Jewish
history, which dates back to the first Spanish explorers to step
foot on the land. Now, the stories of past and present-day Jewish

AN UNDERSTATED ENVOY IN A POLITICAL LION'S DEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By JULIAN E. BARNES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Rick Boucher, a southern Virginia Democrat on
the Judiciary Committee with a deportment as temperate as his
politics, seems a poor fit on a committee where members with an
overdeveloped sense of outrage have few inhibitions about
expressing their feelings.
</P>
<P>
   But Boucher's understated manner made him an ideal candidate to
serve as ambassador to moderate Republicans, a job for which
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt has tapped him. Boucher, co-author of
the Democratic censure measure, has been phoning his moderate
Republican friends to win their support for his compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher appears to know that the best way to change someone's
mind is not to announce one's intentions, however apparent they may
be. And so Boucher said he is trying to establish a ``basis for a
partnership, '' rather than working to persuade Republicans to vote
a certain way.
</P>
<P>
   To Republican leaders, though, ``partnership'' sounds more like
``wedge,'' and they say they believe Boucher may be wielding a
sledgehammer to split their party. Boucher responds that he is
trying to unify the country by preventing a Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are divisions within the nation now, but they are not
deep,'' he said. ``If a trial occurs they will become deep.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Republicans lost five house seats in the November
election, the party's leadership hardened its position on
impeachment and ended efforts among Republican moderates, including
some on the Judiciary Committee, to try to find a compromise
position short of voting to remove the president.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, in an effort to restart the search for a
compromise, Gephardt called a meeting of Democratic moderates to
discuss reaching out to Republicans who might support a censure
resolution. At that meeting, Boucher, who wrote the Democratic
impeachment inquiry plan, was chosen to lead the outreach to
Republican moderates, with whom Clinton's fate would seem to rest.
</P>
<P>
   While admitting he has yet to change any minds, Boucher says his
strategy is to try to get moderate Republicans to see the issue as
he has.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher, who before the impeachment inquiry dealt mostly with
telecommunications reform, has spent no time thinking about who
touched whom in the Clinton-Monica Lewinsky affair. He has eschewed
the details of the report by Kenneth Starr, the independent
counsel, and instead examined the House Judiciary Committee's
report on Watergate. That report, Boucher said, argues mere
misconduct by a president is not enough to impeach; it must be
misconduct that threatens the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The facts in this case don't meet that high standard,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said he expects his rounds of phone calls to intensify
next week after the debate moves from the Judiciary Committee to
the floor of the House. He has little pride of authorship over his
censure motion and he said Democrats will tweak it in almost any
way the Republicans want, if that might win their support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are prepared to go where they need to be,'' Boucher said.

ON GAY ISSUE, PSYCHOANALYSIS TREATS ITSELF 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By ERICA GOODE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was no epiphany, Dr. Ralph Roughton recalls, no precise
moment of realization.
</P>
<P>
   But there came a point, two years ago, when he looked around at
his profession and recognized that the need for secrecy, for
pretending to be someone that he was not, was no longer so urgent.
He sat down at his word processor and wrote a letter to the 28
other psychoanalysts on the faculty of the Emory University
Psychoanalytic Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time now feels right for me to answer the unasked
questions,'' he said in the letter, ``and I am writing to each of
you so that you will hear it directly from me.''
</P>
<P>
   What they heard was that Roughton, then 63 _ a supervising
analyst and former director of the institute, with 41 years of
marriage behind him _ was gay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt risky,'' Roughton said, ``but it also felt very
freeing.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not have to wait long for a reaction. Soon after mailing
his declaration, he began receiving calls and notes from his
colleagues. They congratulated him on his courage. They said they
felt they knew him better now. They even sent him more referrals.
</P>
<P>
   The response, many psychoanalysts say, is a measure of just how
much has changed in a field that for more than a half century
viewed homosexuality as an illness and deemed homosexuals unfit to
become psychoanalysts. And in an unusual illustration of this
turnaround, the American Psychoanalytic Association at its annual
meetings in Manhattan next week will present an open forum,
``Homophobia: analysis of a `permissible' prejudice,'' featuring
Rep. Barney Frank, the gay congressman from Massachusetts, Roughton
and others as speakers.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the forum, Roughton said, the association, which was
founded in 1911 by American followers of Sigmund Freud and remains
the dominant psychoanalytic organization in the United States,
plans to acknowledge its own past homophobia, though ``we won't
dwell on it at length or do a lot of breast beating,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing happens quickly in psychoanalysis, and the shift in
attitudes about homosexuality is no exception. Unlike the American
Psychiatric Association, which removed homosexuality from its list
of mental disorders in 1973, psychoanalysts persisted well into the
1980s in describing homosexuality as a ``perversion,'' and analysts
continued to speak of their ability to ``cure'' the ``serious
character disorders'' of their gay patients.
</P>
<P>
   Roughton himself went through two long analyses, he said, in an
effort to become heterosexual. ``My perspective was the same as the
whole analytic community, that this was something wrong with me
that needed to be changed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even a decade ago, an admission of homosexuality by a senior
analyst often meant a damaged career and a chilly reception from
other analysts. In ``Becoming Gay'' (Pantheon, 1996), Dr. Richard
Isay, a New York analyst, wrote bitterly of his experience of
``coming out'' in the analytic profession in the 1980s. Until 1991,
when the psychoanalytic association adopted a policy prohibiting
training institutes from discriminating on the basis of sexual
orientation, homosexual applicants were summarily turned away;
many, aware of the prevailing view, did not even bother to apply.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, however, things began to change, spurred by the
arrival of new leaders, the constant badgering by Isay on the
issue, and the greater visibility and acceptance of homosexuality
in American culture as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   There are now 35 to 40 openly gay and lesbian candidates
training in 29 psychoanalytic institutes around the country, and 15
of about 1,000 faculty members are openly gay, according to members
of the psychoanalytic association's Committee on Issues of
Homosexuality. A welcoming reception was held for gay and lesbian
participants at meetings in San Diego in May. And last December, an
executive committee passed, by an overwhelming majority, a
resolution asking states ``not to interfere with same-gender
couples who choose to marry.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there remain some among the 3,200 psychoanalysts who
make up the national association who disapprove of these changes.
In 1992, a group of analysts, led by Dr. Charles Socarides, founded
the National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality,
an organization that advocates therapy to change homosexuals into
heterosexuals. Dr. Houston MacIntosh, a Washington psychoanalyst
who has presented papers at the association's meetings, said the
group ``provides a counterbalance to the current rush to embrace
the gay political agenda by the leadership of the American
Psychoanalytic Association.''
</P>
<P>
   But most analysts view the Socarides-led group as extreme.
``Those who still pathologize homosexuality are a distinct
minority,'' said Dr. Marvin Margolis, past president of the
psychoanalytic association, ``and they are gradually decreasing in
number and influence.''
</P>
<P>
   Freud himself was tolerant of homosexuality. Though he described
it as ``an arrest of sexual development,'' he argued that
homosexuals should not be prevented from becoming analysts purely
on the basis of their sexual orientation. ``Homosexuality is
assuredly no advantage,'' he wrote in a famous 1921 letter to an
American woman concerned about her son, ``but it is nothing to be
ashamed of, no vice, no degradation. It cannot be classified as an
illness.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, however, prominent psychoanalysts, many of
them Europeans who immigrated just before or after World War II,
took a much more rigid stance, classifying homosexuality firmly as
a neurosis in need of treatment. At least one analyst, Dr. Edmund
Bergler, ventured far beyond clinical detachment. ``Homosexuals are
essentially disagreeable people regardless of their pleasant or
unpleasant manner,'' he said in a 1956 paper. ``Like all psychic
masochists, they are subservient when confronted with a stronger
person, merciless when in power, unscrupulous about trampling on a
weaker person.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Dr. Paul Lynch, a Boston analyst who in 1993 was one of
the first two openly gay candidates to begin analytic training,
said he thought that for most analysts, prejudice was born of life
within a sheltered profession rather than active bigotry. ``Many of
these analysts didn't know a gay person as a friend or a social
acquaintance, or somebody they were able to talk about it with
outside of their offices,'' Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
   His own experience when he entered the institute was positive,
he said. ``I was worried when I first joined because there were so
few of us. But there really does seem to be a hunger for people to
know more about this.'' In his second year in training, Lynch said,
he realized that negative attitudes toward homosexuals laced much
of the analytic literature he was reading for his courses. When he
raised the issue, the institute took steps to change the
curriculum. ``They really went to work and thanked me for exposing
this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although attitudes have changed, the theory most psychoanalysts
rely on to guide them in treating patients lags far behind.
Classical psychoanalytic theory held that the path of normal
development led children to be attracted to the opposite sex parent
and to compete with the same-sex parent: the drama of the Oedipus
complex. Homosexuality represented a derailment of this sequence, a
so-called developmental arrest. And while Freud viewed the cause of
homosexuality as a mystery, later theorists attributed it to early
traumas and failures in parenting.
</P>
<P>
   With the changing climate and advances in scientific knowledge
about human sexuality, a number of analysts now are trying to
develop new theories that take account of homosexuality as an
expression of normal development.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Friedman, clinical professor of psychiatry at Payne
Whitney Clinic at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center and
co-author of ``Male Homosexuality: A Contemporary Psychoanalytic
Perspective'' (Yale University Press, 1990), for example,
integrates psychoanalytic theory with findings from genetics and
neurobiology. Current science, Friedman said, indicates that sexual
desire begins somewhere between the ages of 5 and 10, later than
Freud believed, and that it is not primarily directed at either
parent. ``As a result,'' Friedman said, ``homosexual men are not on
an abnormal developmental track: they were never destined to be
sexually attracted to their mothers in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Isay has also written about male homosexual development from a
psychoanalytic viewpoint, and he argues that analysts who fall back
on traditional theory in treating homosexual patients are doing
more harm than good. ``I've done a number of consultations with
people who are seeing traditional analysts,'' Isay said, ``and it
seems to me that there's still an adherence to heterosexual
theories.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Chicago analysts, Dr. Robert Galatzer-Levy and Dr. Bertram
Cohler, have undertaken a comprehensive review of scientific work
on homosexuality, with the hope of helping consolidate and extend
psychoanalytic thinking. In their report, which was financed by the
American Psychoanalytic Association and will be published in book
form sometime next year by Chicago University Press, they conclude,
Galatzer-Levy said, that ``homosexuality is not associated with any
psychopathology in any way'' and that ``there is no evidence that
any form of therapy, including psychoanalysis and the Christian
therapies, can change sexual orientation.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Chicago analysts also found that the case for
homosexuality as purely biological in origin was still inconclusive
and that the field still awaited a single coherent theory. ``We
simply don't have enough good information,'' Galatzer-Levy said,
``and one of our major points is to emphasize and to be comfortable
with how much we don't know.''

HOW A WALTON-OWNED BANK FOUGHT TO GROW IN OKLAHOMA
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Okla.) (For release Sunday, Dec. 13) 
(bl) 
By BOB HARING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why on earth would a bank want to turn itself into a savings and
loan?
</P>
<P>
   It happened in Tulsa, Okla., on Dec. 1. State Bank &AMP; Trust Co.,
owned by the Walton family of Wal-Mart Stores, took the rare legal
step to clear the way to open four branches in the state, including
two in Wal-Mart stores. Some competitors worry that there is more
to the move than meets the eye.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma law limits banks to two branches each, though the rule
can be bent by acquiring another institution, including one
chartered expressly for the purpose. Oklahoma's largest banks have
grown to as many as 70 branches that way, usually paying for the
acquisitions with stock.
</P>
<P>
   But State Bank, a subsidiary of the Walton-owned Arvest Bank
Group, is privately held and generally had to pay cash for
acquisitions. It managed to grow to 12 branches, including two in
Wal-Mart stores, but its latest expansion plans ran into stiff
resistance.
</P>
<P>
   So State Bank became the first major national bank to convert
directly to a savings and loan _ State Federal Savings &AMP; Loan
Association, and thus became exempt from the branching law. ``It
will give us the ability to go where we want to go,'' said the
bank's executive vice president, Larry Choate.
</P>
<P>
   And that is seen as a threat by the state's Community Bankers
Association. There would be ``an unbelievable impact if they decide
to put a branch in every store,'' said James McKeown, the group's
executive director.
</P>
<P>
   Bank branches in discount stores and supermarkets are generally
leased by the retailer to the highest bidder. The Walton family tie
is what makes State Bank worrisome to McKeown's group. ``They will
change those banks to their own banks,'' he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   State federal officials dismissed McKeown's concern, calling the
rechartering a last resort. ``We did not want to do it,'' said the
bank's president, Donald Walker, ``but you cannot serve Tulsa with
just five locations.'' He said the bank gets no advantage from the
Walton family connection and must still compete for branch leases.
And Choate said Arvest chief executive Jim Walton ``could care less
if we put a branch in a Wal-Mart.''
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma Banking Commissioner Mick Thompson said that to escape
the branching limits, other Oklahoma banks might follow the lead of
State Federal and a state savings and loan, Mid-First, which
switched to a federal charter last year.

`PRINCE OF EGYPT' KEPT UNDER WRAPS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When DreamWorks SKG co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg
decided to turn the story of Moses into his studio's first major
animated film four years ago, he knew the pathway to parting the
Red Sea was littered with land mines. So Katzenberg and studio
executives initiated an extraordinary outreach to religious leaders
_ Christians, Jews and Muslims _ to avoid the kind of controversy
and protests that have plagued other studios (in particular,
Katzenberg's former employer Disney) over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, DreamWorks talked to several hundred theologians,
historians and archeologists, as well as Christian, Jewish and
Muslim authorities. The studio showed its movie, ``The Prince of
Egypt,'' for 75 cardinals at the Vatican, as well as for such
diverse cultural figures as Jesse Jackson, Billy Graham and Rabbi
Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center.
</P>
<P>
   After the screenings, those who attended offered their opinions
and DreamWorks officials took careful notes. It seemed a fair
bargain: The studio inoculated itself from criticism while
religious leaders came away believing Hollywood cared about their
views.
</P>
<P>
   But now on the eve of the Friday release of ``The Prince of
Egypt,'' DreamWorks is doing everything it can to distance itself
from the its religious themes. Screenings for religious leaders
have been canceled or delayed. Commercial spots, movie trailers and
print advertisements stress the story's generic elements instead of
its biblical roots. And the studio's publicity machine has clamped
down on newspapers and media outlets interested in pursuing pieces
that mention the Bible before entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is the box-office fate of a $70 million film (plus some
$30 million in marketing costs) and pride. There's little doubt
that Katzenberg, who had an acrimonious breakup with Disney in
1994, would love to show up the Mouse with a critically acclaimed
hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeffrey (Katzenberg) has said several times that his greatest
concern is that this movie will be perceived as a religious film,''
says Ted Baehr, a conservative media critic who consulted with
DreamWorks throughout the making of ``The Prince of Egypt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For one thing,'' Baehr continues, ``he doesn't think he has
made a religious film. He sees it as a mass market entertainment
that just happens to be based on a story from the Bible. It's all
about accessibility. They don't want the movie to be seen as
`medicine.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood couldn't find a more accessible religious figure than
Moses (voiced by Val Kilmer in the film), the compelling lawgiver
and liberator who is a cornerstone of Christian, Muslim and Jewish
faiths. The biblical patriarch has always been a commanding figure
in popular culture, popping up again and again in Renaissance art
and much later in two spectacularly terrible movies made by Cecil
B. DeMille, ``The Ten Commandments'' (1923 and 1956). Each
generation seems to imagine him in a different way, a malleability
that may help explain Moses' mystique.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a goad, a gadfly and he can be very annoying,'' says
religious writer Jonathan Kirsch, whose new book ``Moses: A Life,''
provides a wide-ranging portrait of the Old Testament leader.
``Indeed, the Israelites are shown to be perfectly fed up with him
time and again. Even God is sick and tired with Moses at times. But
Moses never stops challenging us to choose for ourselves how we
want to live.''
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks' ``The Prince of Egypt'' puts its own spin on Moses,
recasting him, in the words of New Yorker critic David Denby, as a
``noisy American teen-ager.'' In the film, Moses and the Egyptian
Pharaoh Ramses are portrayed as brothers whose childhood bond is
torn apart when Moses discovers his Jewish roots. The 93-minute
movie casts all of its characters _ with the exception of the slave
masters _ in an equally sympathetic light. Never once are the Jews
called God's chosen people. God, when heard from, is diminished to
an austere, disembodied voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``DreamWorks has made the story as bland as possible so no group
will be offended,'' Kirsch says. ``That's why they courted all
these religious leaders. If the movie had been seen as religiously
controversial, they knew the public would see it as a `religious'
movie. To avoid that at all costs, they talked to rabbis and
ministers as kind of an ersatz marketing research effort.''
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks officials, including Katzenberg, producers Penny
Finkelman Cox and Sandra Rabins and the studio's religious
consultant, Tzivia Schwartz-Getzug, refused to comment for this
story.
</P>
<P>
   The response is consistent with problems other news outlets,
including Newsweek and the San Diego Union-Tribune, have
encountered when trying to write about the film's religious themes.
DreamWorks marketing executive Mike Vollman canceled the
Union-Tribune's interviews with Katzenberg and other ``Prince of
Egypt'' filmmakers when the paper refused to assign an
entertainment reporter instead of a religious writer to the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our reporter was an award-winning staff writer and we assigned
her the story because we wanted a unique, interesting piece,'' says
the paper's arts editor, Lee Grant. ``After she went to a
screening, DreamWorks called and said we had to assign a different
writer _ an entertainment writer _ because they didn't want to give
out the impression that the movie was an uplifting, spiritual,
religious kind of experience.''
</P>
<P>
   That's certainly the kind of experience religious leaders, at
least the ones who were consulted, seem to be having. Baehr, who
works for the Christian Film and Television Association in
Camarillo, has shown the film on behalf of DreamWorks to numerous
church groups and he says the response has typically been quite
positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a beautiful film,'' Baehr says. ``It works as
entertainment and it works as theology.''
</P>
<P>
   On a basic level, yes, agrees professor Robert Banks of
Pasadena's Fuller Theological Seminary. ``But,'' he adds, ``it's
theology on a rather simplistic level, theology that tries to be
all things to all people.''
</P>
<P>
   Such inclusive thinking was one of the reasons why Katzenberg
and DreamWorks talked to more than 500 religious leaders throughout
the various stages of ``The Prince of Egypt.'' David Geffen, who,
along with Steven Spielberg, founded DreamWorks, reportedly
cautioned Katzenberg early on that the story of Moses was ``not a
fairy tale'' and had to be treated with care and respect. For
Katzenberg, who made his name in Hollywood with such Disney
animated movies as ``The Lion King'' and ``Beauty and the Beast,''
that meant no toy action figures, no Burning Bush night lights and,
more significantly, no fast-food tie-ins.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, says movie analyst Rich Ingrassia, when the call went out
to religious leaders, DreamWorks was subtly enlisting their support
as well as listening to their comments and concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a wonderful thing that they wanted input from the
three great religions on this story,'' says Hier, founder of the
Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles. Katzenberg, who is a member
of the center's board, asked Hier to organize a meeting with
leaders of the three branches of Judaism. Later, when the studio
screened ``Prince of Egypt'' for him, Hier came away impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a labor of love, you can see that,'' Hier says. ``I think
it will be a very effective film that will have an
inter-denominational appeal and will also reach those who don't
belong to any particular religion.''
</P>
<P>
   And those are the very people DreamWorks' marketing executives
are trying to lure into theaters. Since the toy and fast-food
tie-ins were off-limits, the studio has resorted to some creative
ploys. Last month, DreamWorks' record label released a heavily
hyped set of soundtrack albums _ one by Nashville artists, one by
gospel stars and a third containing the film's score _ designed to
make an impression on widely varied audiences. Early sales haven't
been good (only the score is in Billboard's Top 100), but will
likely pick up once the film arrives in theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Sales have been pretty decent at Wal-Mart, where the giant
retailer has been moving ``Prince of Egypt'' gift packages that
include a soundtrack compilation, an illustrated children's book, a
limited-edition lithograph and two tickets to the film. Jim Tharp,
DreamWorks chief of distribution, believes the package is the first
of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you'll find a lot of those packages under Christmas
trees, especially in the heartland,'' says Ingrassia, a movie
analyst for the investment firm Paul Kagen and Associates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, I can't help but feel DreamWorks has missed a big
opportunity to market the movie more to the religious community. I
don't know why Hollywood is so afraid of religion. If you look at
the best-seller lists, you'll see a ton of religious titles. It's a
subject people are thinking a lot about these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Baehr agrees, saying he recently spoke to a Warner Bros.
executive who told him that ``if `The Prince of Egypt' were my
movie, I'd be pre-selling tickets in the churches.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I passed that along to Jeffrey,'' Baehr says, ``and he kept
saying, `No, no, no, no! We don't want churches to presell
tickets.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's making a big mistake,'' Baehr adds, ``but I
understand what he's thinking. He wants a bigger audience.''
</P>
<P>
   And, says Hier, there's nothing wrong with that, particularly
when the studio is investing more than $100 million of its own
money in the finished product.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what studios do,'' Hier says. ``They try to get people
into the theaters and they use any means necessary. Why should it
be any different with `The Prince of Egypt?'''
</P>
<P>
   It's a question rooted more in marketing than theology, perhaps
an indication of the true essence of DreamWorks' ``The Prince of
Egypt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Something is lost when you make biblical stories bland and run
away from their theological implications,'' says author Kirsch.
``It sends a message to people not familiar with the Bible that
there's nothing interesting in it, which isn't the case at all.
It's too bad DreamWorks didn't have more faith in the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Or in the message of its own movie.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 13)  
 (af)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Rhonda Tallant of Euless, Texas, decided recently to buy
some fishing equipment for her husband, Curtis, and a vacuum
cleaner for their home, she headed toward her computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been one to go to the malls and spend six hours
looking for two or three gifts when I can spend an hour at home in
my chair and get everything I need,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She is far from alone. Analysts say that as many as 20 million
people have made at least one purchase on line. On the Thanksgiving
weekend, daily visits to Web sites that sell toys, for example,
jumped 56 percent, to 832,000, from the average before the holiday,
according to Media Metrix, a company that measures Internet
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester Research, a consulting firm, estimates that Americans
will buy almost $8 billion worth of merchandise on the Internet
this year, up from $3 billion last year, and that holiday sales
will account for $3.5 billion of the total.
</P>
<P>
   While these figures represent less than 1 percent of all retail
sales, said Kate Delhagen, an analyst at Forrester, she expects
Internet sales to reach $108 billion, or 6 percent of total sales,
by 2003. That would be twice the 3 percent share now made through
direct mail and telemarketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going mainstream,'' she said. ``We are in a
momentum-building stage right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumers are already facing an ever-widening array of Web
shopping choices _ and not just for books, CDs and toys. There are
also sites for buying cooking supplies (cooking.com), furs
(furs.com) and pets and pet supplies (acmepet.com). And traditional
retailers, like Macy's and Nordstrom, and catalogue merchants like
L.L. Bean and Land's End, now have Web sites, too.
</P>
<P>
   If all the on-line choices are bewildering, shopping guides,
including Shopguide.com, Bottomdollar.com and Mysimon.com, can
track down things like an 8-foot Fraser fir Christmas tree ($100
from Garden.com). And if you are looking to sell items as well as
find possible bargains, there are on-line auctions
(Firstauction.com, Ebay.com).
</P>
<P>
   Lou Richman, finance editor of Consumer Reports, has called the
Internet ``the world's largest mall.'' In that mall, however,
Forrester Research expects consumers to confine about half of their
purchases to two areas: travel services (about $3 billion) and
computer equipment ($1.2 billion).
</P>
<P>
   Among Internet shoppers who were asked what they were likely to
buy on line this season, 47 percent said computer software, 44
percent mentioned CDs and 43 percent said books, according to
Greenfield Online, an Internet marketing research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Book shopping made a convert of Tina Robichaux, a programmer who
lives in Duluth, Ga. Recalling her first attempt at shopping on
line about five years ago, when modems were much slower, she said,
``It was such a pain in the neck.''
</P>
<P>
   But having looked everywhere in stores for a book she wanted,
she gave Internet shopping a second chance and found the book at
Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Now Mrs. Robichaux often shops on the Internet, buying airline
tickets as well as books, making reservations at bed-and-breakfasts
(``I love it because you can tell what a place looks like'') and
ordering fabric from a small company in Alaska. This holiday
season, she plans to buy at least half her presents on line. With
new technology, she said, it is easier than ordering by phone.
</P>
<P>
   With on-line competition growing, many retailers are attracting
shoppers by offering incentive programs or affiliating themselves
with popular Web sites:
</P>
<P>
   _ At Women.com, a site directed at women, about 30 companies,
including, Amazon.com; Hallmark; Sears, Roebuck, and Office Max,
sell products in an on-line store.
</P>
<P>
   _ Netcentives.com offers frequent-flier miles on various
airlines for buying products from any of its three dozen partners,
including 1-800-Flowers, Broderbund Software, Barnesandnoble.com
and J. Crew.
</P>
<P>
   _ Consumers who visit Shop2give.com and buy from an affiliated
retailer, like Brookstone, Omaha Steaks or Outpost.com, have a
portion of their spending donated to the charities of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   To gauge on-line buying, Consumer Reports asked 30 consumers
with varying degrees of Internet shopping experience to each buy a
CD, a polo shirt, a computer game and a gift basket on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were few bargains,'' Richman said, adding that prices
were similar to those in stores.
</P>
<P>
   So far, on-line shopping has not made a significant economic
impact on traditional retailers, but analysts say it eventually
will. At some companies, Internet profits may be gained at the
expense of other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primary point of cannibalism is catalogue sales,'' said
Nicole Vanderbilt, an analyst at Jupiter Communications. ``People
who are willing to shop by catalogue are also willing to shop on
line.''
</P>
<P>
   But on-line shopping will probably never fully replace
brick-and-mortar stores. ``For me, you have to try on clothes,''
Mrs. Robichaux said. ``You don't know the quality of certain things
until you see them.''

NEW MERGERS CONJURE GHOSTS OF NAZIS PAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For release Sunday, Dec. 13) 
(bl) 
By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Five decades later, it's still a sensitive issue. Should Jews
and members of other groups persecuted by the Nazis avoid buying
products made by German companies like Volkswagen or Siemens?
</P>
<P>
   David Harris, executive director of the American Jewish
Committee, said he often polled audiences on the issue at his
speaking engagements. There was a time when the idea of buying a
Mercedes was anathema to many American Jews, some of whom fled
Europe before the Holocaust. But the sentiment recedes with each
passing year, Harris said, as younger Jews find themselves part of
a global economy in which German companies are major participants.
</P>
<P>
   ``There remains a core group of elderly and middle-aged Jews who
categorically would never set foot in Germany or buy German
products,'' said Harris, 49, who doesn't count himself among that
group. ``But I've seldom seen a young American Jew balk at buying a
BMW.''
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between American Jews and German companies has
come to the fore again through a collision of two trends: a wave of
big mergers between German and U.S. companies, and a growing number
of lawsuits against the some of the same German companies, as well
as others, seeking compensation for Holocaust-era wrongs.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, New York City Comptroller Alan Hevesi called on
federal and state regulators to block the proposed takeover of
Bankers Trust by Deutsche Bank until the German bank resolves
accusations that it profited from the Nazi war machine. Some
American Jews were also displeased when Daimler-Benz, the maker of
Mercedes automobiles, merged with Chrysler, forming
DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
   Roman Kent, the chairman of the American Gathering of Holocaust
Survivors, said his organization's members still did not buy German
products. ``For us survivors, time is not the best medicine,'' said
Kent, who was imprisoned in several concentration camps. ``Now that
I'm older, when I have more time to reflect, the memories come back
and hound me more than they did when I was making a living and
having a family.''
</P>
<P>
   But some people involved in the growing wave of claims against
German banks and manufacturers offer a different perspective. Elan
Steinberg, the 43-year-old executive director of the World Jewish
Congress, which began the campaign that forced Swiss banks to
search for dormant accounts opened by people who perished in the
Holocaust, said he had no problem buying German products.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, while many of the lawyers representing Holocaust
survivors and their families are Jewish, many Jewish lawyers and
business people can also be found among those defending the
companies from which compensation is being sought.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Hoxter, president of Hoxter Inc., a public-relations and
marketing company based in New York, found himself with the
unenviable task of explaining the posture of Swiss banks to
reporters as the controversy over the dormant accounts exploded.
</P>
<P>
   Hoxter, who fled Germany as a teen-ager in 1938, has spent much
of his career representing German and Swiss companies, a role he
says his first wife, now deceased, viewed with displeasure.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wouldn't buy a German car,'' Hoxter said. ``She originally
protested, `How could you work for a Germany company?' But in
general, I have no problems with it.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, Hoxter says, his job has allowed him to extract his
own small measure of vengeance. He was once introduced to a Porsche
official whose name sounded familiar. Hoxter, a U.S. intelligence
officer during the war, said he awoke that night and remembered who
the man was: an organizer of a murderous sneak attack in which
German infantrymen disguised themselves in U.S. uniforms. Hoxter
said he told Porsche about the man's wartime role, and the man was
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, of the American Jewish Committee, said his views on
buying German were changed by his first trip to Israel. To his
surprise, he saw that all the taxis and buses were Mercedes models.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't understand it'' at first, Harris said. ``Then I
came to understand that Germany is Israel's closest friend in the
world after the United States.''

IT ALL ADDS UP TO ANOTHER NEAR-MISS FOR CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   We all have front seats for this train wreck.
</P>
<P>
   When impeachment goes to a vote Thursday or Friday, Bill
Clinton's survival in office is weighed on the same political scale
as the the fate of the Republican Party's prospects in the House,
Senate and presidential elections of November 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why my sniffer tells me the House of Representatives
will ultimately decide to censure, but not impeach. The
straight-line partisan vote out of the House judiciary Committee
Friday pushes the issue to the next level, consideration by the
full 435-member House.
</P>
<P>
   Riding this runaway locmotive is the Republican leadership in
the House. They are playing Casey Jones, and there's a serious
train wreck in the offing. News reports and congressional leaders
of both parties suggested Friday that the vote of the full House
was still too close to call. Three Democrats from southern or
western states said they'd vote to force Clinton to undergo an
impeachment trial in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   If the other Democrats stand fast, then Clinton needs more than
a dozen House Republicans to break party ranks and save him from
becoming the second president to undergo an impeachment trial in
the Senate. My hunch is Clinton will get them.
</P>
<P>
   I think wiser GOP heads -- among the presidential candidates,
the senators and most of all the governors, who are best
innoculated against the ideological virus that infects the
congressional Republicans -- may conclude that impeachment is a
trap. The American public has already spoken twice on this
Clinton-Lewinsky mess, first in the rebuke of the GOP in last
November's election results, and then last week in an NBC-Wall
Street Journal poll.
</P>
<P>
   By 68 percent to 28, the sample shouted a loud ''No!'' to
impeachment. That did not deter the Republican phalanx on the House
Judiciary Committee, which voted in lockstep to impeach.
</P>
<P>
   But many Republican senators have to be privately aghast. If the
House sends the impeachment tar baby on to the Senate, there's no
way out: it'll be a full-blown trial, with the senators locked into
their chairs, speechless, pinned down by C-SPAN to a relentless
recital of the sexual peccadiloes that everyone knows about. No
serious nosecounter thinks there are anywhere near 67 votes in the
Senate to impeach. It takes a two-thirds vote, and if Clinton is
going to beat the rap anyway, why put him, the Senate, and the
country through the wringer, when he's out of office anyway in two
years?
</P>
<P>
   In the northeast, particularly, Republican officeholders regard
an impeachment trial with dread. A vote to impeach Clinton for a
northeastern congressman or senator could well be a career-ender.
And if he's not going to be removed from office in the end, who
begin this journey to political nowhere?
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Chafee (R-RI) is 75, pondering whether to run for a
fifth term in two years; do you think he wants to confront an
impeachment trial between now and then? For the Sunbelt Solons who
harpoon Clinton with impunity in their states, it's much less of a
problem. But impeachment has the potential to turn the lights out
on Republicans at all levels in New England, New York, New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Next time around, there are 19 GOP seats up for grabs, to 15
Democratic ones. A net gain of five, if the Democrats hold the
White House, puts the GOP leadership back in the minority, with
none of the current priviliges of holding hearings, timing votes,
and conducting unlimited investigations of Democratic officials
from the president on down.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's patented smooth talk has not served him well through
Monicagate, but his last-minute speech Friday in the Rose Garden,
timed to take the PR edge off the predictable 21-16 committee vote,
found Clinton at his sorrowfull-est. Bill is the best apologizer in
the business. He's had more experience than any other politician.
And he does it effectively.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the Mendacity Capital of the world, there is a
move afoot to make the censure option a bit more palatable to
tenderfooted congressmen by slapping some kind of substantial fine
onto the paperwork. How do you put a price on honor? Is $300,000
appropriate? That's what Newt Gingrich had to pay for whatever it
was he got caught doing. Do Clinton's sins merit a $2 million
penalty? That was the fee former President Reagan got in 1989 for
flying to Japan for a quickie round of speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Is $4.5 million the appropriate amount? That's how much Gingrich
was offered in a two-book contract deal from Rupert Murdoch --
before Newt had to back out of the deal, claiming he absolutely,
positively had no idea that media mogul Murdoch had a keen interest
in telecommunications legislation Newt controlled.
</P>
<P>
   I think the notion of imposing a fine on a president for
Clinton's bad behavior is a nutty idea. The proper rebuke for such
lapses in good conduct is humiliation, which Clinton has had to
swallow in huge doses, and not some arbitrary fine, which Clinton
could pay off with one fund-raising party in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP lost five House seats last month, and goes into 2000
defending the thinnest House majority in 43 years. In this century,
the House changed hands only eight times. But in nine of the last
14 presidential elections, whichever side wins the White House has
picked up at least six House seats -- just what the Democrats need
to make Dick Gephardt (D-Mo.) the Speaker. Two dozen House
Republicans won by less than 10 percent of the vote, five of them
from California, where a Democratic tide is running deep.
</P>
<P>
   Three of those five California seats went Republican with less
than 50 percent of the total vote. Twenty Democrats overall won by
less than 10 percent. But in a presidential year like 2000, turnout
goes up, usually boosting Democrats' chances. So the Democrats can
recruit more robust candidates for contested seats, given their
excellent chance to take back the House. One more reason why I
think Clinton dodges the impeachment bullet? Social Security reform
is on the docket. Nothing happens there without bipartisanship. And
Clinton has this huge club in his closet: his ability to bludgeon
the GOP over Social Security. Summing up? I think Clinton has
another near-miss experience this week when the House votes.

CADILLAC ESCALADE: 6 DEGREES OF SPORT UTILITY SEPARATION

<TEXT>
<P>
   Placards in New York City subway cars used to advertise a
paternity testing service. If you called DAD-SEARCH in a certain
area code, the people there would help you determine who fathered
your children. A valuable service, certainly, but could they trace
the DNA of your car?
</P>
<P>
   Around Detroit, incestuous relationships and unholy alliances
produce some curious offspring. Consider the progeny of Cadillac, a
grand patriarch of the industry: In the 80s, the dignified family
crest appeared on a small car, the Cimarron, that obviously shared
its genes with a lowbrow Chevy Cavalier.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Cadillac became the proud parent of a bouncing
baby named Catera, which was short, muscular and continental, not
oversized, swaggering and American. An amorous European _ face it,
a common Opel _ was the absentee father.
</P>
<P>
   Now Cadillac is showing its latest charge, a strapping brute
named Escalade, which even in fancy clothes seems more blue-collar
than blue blood. It is practically a dead ringer for the GMC
Denali, a black-tie version of the Yukon sport utility.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder some people at GMC feel that after they went through
labor, Cadillac carted the baby home from the nursery and disguised
him with a stick-on mustache.
</P>
<P>
   It was a kidnapping born of desperation. Dealers were demanding
a sport utility, and they wanted one fast, having watched legions
of customers defect to offerings from Land Rover, Lexus and
Lincoln. Frivolous as they may seem to many people, leather-swathed
$40,000-plus trucks are hotter than Palm Springs in July.
</P>
<P>
   And Cadillac was slow to develop its own home-grown, car-based
sport utility, which won't be available until the 2002 model year.
</P>
<P>
   So the division cast jealous eyes at the Denali _ originally
intended to be the fanciest sport utility from General Motors'
newly fancy truck division. Since GMC had done the heavy lifting,
Cadillac came up with its version in just 10 months.
</P>
<P>
   That is not as impressive as it may sound, since differences are
few: the Cadillac has a new grille; fancier ``Nuance'' leather; a
wood-trimmed steering wheel; a simplified link to Onstar, GM's
driver-assistance service, and a longer warranty (four years
instead of three).
</P>
<P>
   Escalate? Escapade? No, it's Escalade, pronounced ESS-kuh-lade
and defined by Webster's as ``the act of scaling or climbing the
walls of a fortified place using ladders.''
</P>
<P>
   Very loosely translated, it means that unless you're involved in
the NBA lockout, you may not be able to climb in or bail
gracefully. And while these trucks _ the first in Cadillac's 96
years of existence _ are perfectly capable of scaling heights, many
will venture no farther off-road than the valet lane at the yacht
club. The Escalade's capabilities, like those of most
status-utility vehicles, will rarely be explored.
</P>
<P>
   That is too bad, for even if its background is working class,
the Escalade has good bones. Under its expanses of plastic
lower-body panels, it _ like the Yukon/Denali _ is essentially a
Chevrolet Tahoe. These are still among the most pleasing big
utilities to drive, even if their design is getting old.
</P>
<P>
   Stable and secure, with reasonably good feedback from the
steering and a dampened but well-controlled ride, the Escalade
handles well for its size. Of course, it is not highly
maneuverable. Nor is it spirited; with nearly 5,600 pounds to lug
around, GM's formidable 5.7-liter V8 bogs down on steep hills or in
high-speed passing moves.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln's Navigator, meanwhile, is getting a modern 32-valve V8
that produces 300 horsepower and 355 foot-pounds of torque (versus
Cadillac's 255 and 330 foot-pounds). The Navigator also wins on
seating (it handles up to eight, compared with five in the
Escalade), and in sheer presence (though one could argue that the
relatively understated Escalade has more class). Given the
possibilities for schlocky styling, Cadillac deserves a
commendation for its restraint.
</P>
<P>
   But integrated running boards and luggage racks cannot obscure
the age of the Escalade's platform, which made its debut with the
last-generation Chevy pickup of 1988. It is a point driven home by
test drives of the all-new '99 Chevy trucks, which are smoother,
more responsive and nearly as comfortable _ at least for two people
_ as the Escalade, and they cost $25,000 less.
</P>
<P>
   These new trucks will make a great foundation for the
next-generation Tahoe, Yukon, et al., of 2000, raising this
question: Why buy the last of the old ones?
</P>
<P>
   Take the instrument panel, essentially the same one in the
battered pickup driven by the guy who mows yards around the
neighborhood. The latest trucks have a far better dashboard, with
big, well-placed controls.
</P>
<P>
   Or consider the back-seat windows, which retract only six
inches. (Why not just seal them permanently?) Or the express-down
window control, which worked (like the Denali's) about 25 percent
of the time.
</P>
<P>
   There are other touches typical of trucks but unbecoming of
Cadillacs. The Escalade lacks an automatic climate control, a
sunroof or steering-wheel buttons for the stereo or cruise.
</P>
<P>
   The captain's chairs adjust in many ways, but the controls _
five buttons, knobs and toggles along the outside of the seat
bottom, plus a recliner lever _ are inconvenient and confusing. Nor
do the seats ``remember'' preferred settings _ a must-have for many
luxury-level shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   The new Onstar setup, three buttons on the overhead console, is
an improvement over the previous system, which was integrated into
a cell phone handset. Push one button and you are connected to
eagerly helpful young adults in Michigan. They know your name and
location, thanks to satellite positioning, and will help you find
your way, get to a gas station or restaurant, or contact local
emergency services.
</P>
<P>
   Onstar is free for a year in the Escalade. (It costs about
$1,200, plus $20 a month, in the Denali.) I still find it
disconcerting to chat with a disembodied voice who knows my every
move, but I can appreciate Onstar's value for someone like, say, my
elderly mother.
</P>
<P>
   The push-button four-wheel-drive setup worked well, but the
brakes, like those of other older-design GM trucks, were
disappointingly tentative; the mushy, long-throw pedal felt like
the Stairmaster at the gym.
</P>
<P>
   There are no options, just a choice of color. The price,
$46,525, is $2,370 over the Denali; some dealers have complained
that they get a smaller price break on the Cadillac. Escalade
leases are running as much as $100 a month over the Navigator.
</P>
<P>
   Both Denali and Escalade are more than competent, though neither
is truly compelling, given their old designs and new competition.
After waiting 96 years for a truck, Cadillac could have held out
for more. &QL;

<P>
   Faced with a daylong debate on a proposed article of impeachment
against the president of the United States, only the third such
debate in the nation's history, the three big broadcast networks
responded Friday with a collective shrug, and the message: Wake us
when they're voting.
</P>
<P>
   While three all-news cable networks _ CNN, MSNBC and Fox News _
along with C-Span and some PBS stations, carried comprehensive
coverage of the full debate over the articles of impeachment
proposed by the House Judiciary Committee, ABC, NBC and CBS limited
their coverage to the actual votes on the articles.
</P>
<P>
   But because the president made a statement at 4 p.m., the
networks' timing was thrown off and the full committee vote on
Article 1 was seen only on CBS, with the other two networks joining
it in progress.
</P>
<P>
   Network news executives offered several explanations for their
decision to limit the coverage on Friday, beginning with the fact
that the public interest was being served by the extensive coverage
available on the cable news channels.
</P>
<P>
   But several executives said candidly that they felt no real
pressure for widespread coverage, both because the outcome was
completely predictable and because, as Lane Venardos, the executive
producer of special events for CBS, put it, ``people are totally
tired of it and would just as soon hear no more about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another network executive noted that ratings for the cable news
networks carrying extensive coverage do not indicate a ground swell
of public interest in the debate. Indeed, a CNN spokesman reported
that while ratings for coverage of the committee's deliberations on
Tuesday and Wednesday far surpassed the typical ratings for the
channel, the figures did not approach the audience levels reached
by numerous previous news events.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, for example, CNN's coverage was seen by about 1.5
million people, up from an average day's audience of about 415,000
people. MSNBC had an audience of about 260,000 and Fox News an
audience of about 118,000, both higher than their usual figures.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, during a typical week of the O.J. Simpson trial,
almost 5 million people were watching CNN's coverage. And more than
5 million were watching CNN during the contentions Senate
confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas,
even though all the broadcast networks were also covering that
event.
</P>
<P>
   Venardos said, ``What we have has here is mostly the same people
saying the same things.'' He added, ``People are saying they're fed
up with it.''
</P>
<P>
   At ABC, Eileen Murphy, the spokeswoman for ABC News, said the
network had deemed the outcome in the committee so predictable that
only the official votes on the articles of impeachment had news
value, and then purely for their place in the country's history.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   History suggests that public interest was considerably higher 24
years ago, during the House Judiciary Committee's vote on articles
of impeachment against President Richard Nixon. There was
considerably more network coverage at the time, but several network
executives pointed out that this was an era before an all-news
cable channel existed.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, the networks did not devote themselves to
gavel-to-gavel coverage of the House proceedings. Under what was
then an unusual agreement among the networks, ABC, CBS and NBC
agreed to rotate coverage of the Watergate proceedings, first in
the Senate and then during the pursuit of articles of impeachment
in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Each network took a day and blocked out its regular program
schedule for the Watergate coverage. That way no network suffered
any ratings falloff for its regular daytime programs.
</P>
<P>
   But networks did add unilateral coverage when they believed the
events were of sufficient importance. On July 30, 1974, for
example, when the committee passed three articles of impeachment,
CBS broke into its coverage three separate times _ at 3:24, 6:21
and 10:59 p.m. _ for just a few minutes each time to cover the
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's network coverage was of similar duration. But
executives from all three networks said coverage might be more
extensive when the full House meets to debate the articles of
impeachment.

ON THE REBOUND WITH BILLY BOB

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Billy Bob Thornton is looking good.
</P>
<P>
   Quite a relief. He had us worried there for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Bright-eyed, solidly built, with his hair dyed a vibrant,
platinum blond, Hollywood's redneck renaissance man even has the
country glam look down to a T: simple but elegant leather jacket,
indigo blue jeans, hand-tooled pointy boots and the signature gimme
cap, this one courtesy of the Arkansas State Police.
</P>
<P>
   We know Thornton doesn't really look like the backwoods
grotesques he specializes in playing: ``Sling Blade's''
brain-damaged killer Carl, ``U-Turn's'' twisted Twister-playing
grease monkey and now Jacob Mitchell, the dim-bulb Midwestern geek
in the acclaimed new thriller ``A Simple Plan.''
</P>
<P>
   We saw him looking good in a cowboy tux at the '96 Oscars, where
he won a screenwriting award for ``Sling Blade,'' which was also
Thornton's directing debut. He was even pretty natty as the harried
NASA director in this year's biggest commercial hit,
``Armageddon,'' and his competition in that one were the hunky
likes of Ben Affleck and Bruce Willis.
</P>
<P>
   But real-life Thornton sightings earlier this year presented a
more alarming vision. He had become exceptionally thin, prompting
speculation about dire illness.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing of the kind, Thornton happily reports. Well, maybe a
little, mentally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost a lot of weight,'' he says in a friendly Ozark drawl.
``I'm at my regular size that I've been all my life now, around 160
pounds. For `U-Turn,' I was 197, and when I did `Pushing Tin,'
which is this black comedy about air traffic controllers, after
`Simple Plan,' I was 138.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was by design, I wanted to do it. But I had a few
articles come out _ `What's the deal with him? Is he sick?' No, I
just got too skinny. But frankly, for a while there, I think I had
a little mental problem. I got anorexic; of course, I denied it to
my girlfriend and everyone else who said I had an eating
disorder.''
</P>
<P>
   A common enough affliction, but strange to hear coming from
Thornton. Especially in the context of discussing ``Simple Plan's''
Jacob, a bucktoothed, nearsighted bumpkin with an army surplus
wardrobe and hair oily enough to lube his broken-down pickup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, in the movies, I have no vanity,'' he says with a laugh.
``I, frankly, love playing characters that are different, that look
odd or are odd. That's the fun of it for me. I mean, `Armageddon,'
when I had to play a character like myself, I was freaking out. It
was the hardest thing I've ever had to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hard maybe, but good enough to impress producer Jerry
Bruckheimer, who makes a point of casting his high-octane action
spectaculars with the finest actors he can get. ``Billy Bob's the
real deal,'' Bruckheimer says. ``He's a wonderful actor, and he
adds credibility. He was the glue in `Armageddon,' held the whole
thing together, because every time you cut to him you knew he was
the real deal. And a lot of that was based on the way he looks.''
</P>
<P>
   Looks again. But it's Thornton's ability to bring out the unseen
qualities of a person's soul that distinguishes his on-screen work.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to him discuss Jacob's real motivations when, with his
educated brother Hank (Bill Paxton, who starred in the acclaimed,
Thornton-scripted ``One False Move'') and his unemployed only
friend Lou (Brent Briscoe), he discovers a cache of $4.4 million in
a snow-covered plane wreck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jacob's got one friend; he wishes his brother would be as
close to him, but the brother's a little ashamed of him,'' Thornton
observes. ``He longs for family, and I think he's just trying to
gather it all in. Everything's too scattered; he wants a home. And,
he figures, if he can have money, people will like him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually what I thought as a kid in Arkansas, where we
were pretty poor,'' he adds. ``I thought, if we had money, I'd be
included more, the popular kids would ask me to their parties or
whatever. I think we're told from an early age, `Yeah, if you have
money, you'll do OK.'''
</P>
<P>
   It took a long time for Thornton to learn firsthand that money
doesn't change everything. ``I came out here in my early 20s,''
says the 42-year-old actor, who initially pursued a career in
music. ``And I was definitely like a novelty to people, being from
the South and everything.''
</P>
<P>
   After years of eking out a living in bit parts, he finally got a
regular role on the sitcom ``Hearts Afire.'' Around the same time,
his script (co-written with Tom Epperson) for ``One False Move''
garnered widespread praise.
</P>
<P>
   Then ``Sling Blade'' laid the formerly amused Hollywood at
Thornton's feet. In the two years since, he's acted in six released
features (``Primary Colors,'' ``The Apostle'' and ``Homegrown''
among them), has ``Pushing Tin'' in the can and just finished
directing his second, self-starring feature, ``Daddy and Them,'' a
film about, among other things, male vanity.
</P>
<P>
   In February he'll begin his first directing-for-hire film, and
it's a doozy: an adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's best-selling ``All
the Pretty Horses,'' which will star Matt Damon.
</P>
<P>
   But with massive professional success came at least one big
personal crisis. Shortly after Thornton won his Academy Award, his
fourth wife, Pietra, filed for divorce. Charges of violence and
intimidation were very publicly flung. These days however _ at
least in public _ Thornton sounds nothing but compassionate toward
his ex-wife, with whom he has two young sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``When somebody all of a sudden gets famous and there's
something going on, I know it's a great thing to talk about,'' he
says, his voice growing weary. ``But all we care about in my family
is raising these kids right. That's what we've done. All that other
stuff is gone, and the influence of that is nonexistent to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is great. God bless anybody from my past, I wish
them happiness and peace forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Now in a rewarding relationship with actress Laura Dern,
Thornton admits that, despite the occasional blip on his own
happiness radar, things are looking pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overall shape of things is great. Yeah, I love things.'' &UR;

THE NEXT BIG THING? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, December 13, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He had been mowing lawns in suburban Newton, Mass. after getting
his degree in classics from Harvard, according to company legend.
Then a friend drafted him to write an instruction manual for the
Unix computer operating system. Unix had been written by the
telephone company, which was prohibited by an antitrust agreement
from selling it. Its authors happily gave the code away to anyone
who asked, but nobody at Ma Bell got paid to explain how it worked.
</P>
<P>
   He set up a picnic table at a trade show and went home with a
wad of bills the size of a roll of toilet paper. That was Tim
O'Reilly's intiation, 20 years ago, to the mysteries of open-source
software.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he is sole proprieter of a $35 million-a-year publishing
empire with headquarters in the seaside town of Sebastapol, Calif.,
and offices in Paris, Koln, Tokyo, and Cambridge, Mass. O'Reilly
and Associates published far and away the most influential titles
among how-to books about the Web _ so well-branded that they rate a
special kiosk in many stores.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, O'Reilly is the proprieter of the view du
jour of the Next Big Thing. It may even be the correct one. In a
widely attended 31-page essay last month he turned his spotlight on
the greatest threat to Microsoft's dominion of the market for
personal computer and Internet software.
</P>
<P>
   The really, truly Next Big Thing has nothing much to do with the
merger of America Online and Netscape Communications, and their
alliance with Sun Microsystems, however. Instead, he says, it's a
social movement known as open-sourcing, meaning the widespread and
unccordinated collaboration of programmers using ffreely
distributed source code and the communications facilities of the
Net.
</P>
<P>
   However obscurely named, the tendency to open-sourcing posesses
an economic logic so powerful that O'Reilly thinks it could
transform the software industry so completely that, in the end, it
would bear a stronger resemblance to the social organization of the
scientific community than to, say, the industrial organization of
the oil business.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it was the ethos of science _ ``no kings, no priests,
just a rough consensus and running code'' in the phrase of one
pioneer _ that governed the Internet Engineering Task Force. That
obscure peer-selected planning group oversaw the creation of the
Internet from the beginning. It had a natural affinity for ``the
rough-and-tumble search for optimal solutions'' that is the essence
of the spirit of openness. Its ultimate expression _ so far _ is
the ultra-democratic collaborative medium known as the World Wide
Web.
</P>
<P>
   If open-sourcing continues to spread _ and O'Reilly shows that
the movement already is well under way _ then you can relax in some
deep sense about Bill Gates being the greatest threat to the planet
after global warming. The transition from the age of software to
the age of infoware will be at hand.
</P>
<P>
   The issue surfaced four-square last month in an article O'Reilly
wrote about ``The Open-Sourcing Revolution'' that filled an issue
of Esther Dyson's celebrated newsletter, Release 1.0.
</P>
<P>
   This in itself was an example of open sourcing, for ordinarily
Dyson's letter is written by Dyson and her hirelings; O'Reilly was
doing a guest shot. No money would have changed hands; in a way,
that is precisely O'Reilly's point. Such is the ruthless efficiency
of the Internet that you, too, can read the piece at
www.edventure.com.release1/1198.html _ for free!
</P>
<P>
   The essence of O'Reilly's argument is that the relentless
commodification process that has been at work in computing for 30
years is about to enter a new stage. What yesterday was proprietary
and expensive is cheap and widely available today.
</P>
<P>
   Thus in the 1950s and 1960s, IBM dominated through hardware.
Software was written by hardware suppliers, or by captive vendors.
Barriers to entry were high.
</P>
<P>
   Then the personal computer took the computer out of glass houses
and put it on desktops. Suddenly barriers to entry were low.
Software entrepreneurs like Bill Gates and Mitch Kapor made
fortunes by creating brand-names that came to dominate their market
applications.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, however, few software products had become hugely
complex, requiring the efforts of thousand of programmers writing
for years. Microsoft's Windows NT operating system is a a good
example. No longer was it possible for solo programmer to have much
influence; he or she needed a venture capitalist and a team.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the code-sharers. The source codes of these huge
commercial programs _ their tightly written underlying mainsprings
_ are their most jealously guarded secrets, the very heart of their
commercial advantage. But the secrecy made it impossible to modify
these programs, which were inelastic and often error-prone.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the thoroughly open _ and therefore modifiable _
Unix program had been developed at huge expense and then given away
by AT&AMP;T, starting in the 1970s. But who today could afford to write
_ and then simply give away _ operating systems that might
challenge the dominance of commercial products?
</P>
<P>
   A Finnish graduate student named Linus Thorvald, for one. In the
early 1990s, Thorvald stepped forward with an home-cooked operating
system kernel that he distributed freely over the Internet. Within
a few years, the Linux system, extensively improved and expanded by
hundreds of computer PhDs, was employed by an estimated 7 million
users _ most of whom affirm its wide-ranging superiority to Windows
NT.
</P>
<P>
   O'Reilly writes, ``The open-source paradigm once-again lowers
the barriers to entry. You can take somebody's else's product and
build your own custom version of it. It lets you scratch your own
itch.... If somebody doesn't like a feature, they can add to it,
subtract from it, or re-implement it. If they give their fix back
to the community, it can be adopted widely very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   And now Red Hat Software has gone into business distributing a
basic Linux package for the bargain sum of $49.95. Bob Young, the
chief executive, says his goal is ``to shrink the dollar value of
the operating systems market'' from Microsoft's billions to $500
million _ of which he hopes to command the lion's share.
</P>
<P>
   There are other products, O'Reilly notes. The Free Software
Foundation's GNU project distributes a set of programmer's tools
for open source systems. The Perl language, created by Larry Wall
(now an O'Reilly employee) is widely used; so are tcl(cq) and
Python.
</P>
<P>
   The Apache Group, a dozen core developers and their surrounding
user group, have achieved a dominant share among Web servers,
despite having no more corporate organization than a shared Web
site. Sendmail _ backbone of the Internet's e-mail infrastructure _
is an open system. So is Samba, a ``stealth'' technology that
permits administrators to work Linux applications into their
Microsoft systems.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is lost on Microsoft, which, after all, has made a
series of dramatic and so far successful adjustments to the sudden
rise of the Internet. An internal Microsoft memo analyzing the
threat posed by Linux and open-source projects in general _
acknowledged authentic by the company _ has turned up on the Web
(at www.opensourece.org/halloween1.html), extensively annotated by
open-source enthusiast Eric Raymond.
</P>
<P>
   Will the open-source argument really overttake the commercial
software industry? The deeper beauty of O'Reilly's argument is the
parallel he draws between the emergence of open science in the
Renaissance and among the community of computer users today. The
imperative to share knowledge in order that it be tested is the
same in each. ``Where scientists talk of replication, open-source
programmers talk of debugging,'' he says. The point is to get it
right and move on. He quotes Grace Hopper, inventor of the
compiler: ``To me programming is more than an important practical
art. It is also a gigantic undertaking in the foundations of
knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of us spend our lives and never note that the great
delicate apparatus for the production and distribution of knowledge
that is science ultimately has nothing to do with the market _
perhaps because so relatively few people are involved. Indeed, the
organization of science in certain ways is just the opposite of the
marketplace _ it is designed to free some people to pursue their
curiosity, wherever it leads. Yet science has made us rich.
</P>
<P>
   If the passion of the large community of geeks, nerds, wonks,
and other computer programmers who are interested in solving
problems of their world succeeds in freeing themselves from
Microsoft's business model, we will benefit similarly _ and so much
the worse for Bill Gates.

IN AN IMPEACHMENT TRIAL, SENATORS ACT AS JURORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Dec. 13)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If the House votes this week to impeach President
Clinton, the president would stand trial in the Senate with Chief
Justice William Rehnquist presiding and the 100 senators acting as
jurors.
</P>
<P>
   The rare Senate impeachment trial _ convened only once before to
judge a president _ would hear evidence and issue a verdict. If
two-thirds of the senators _ a total of 67 if all 100 were present
_ voted to convict the president, he would automatically be removed
from office.
</P>
<P>
   In a Senate with a 55-45 Republican majority, it's highly
unlikely that Clinton would be convicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barring some bombshell, there's no chance at all the president
will be removed,'' said Ross Baker, a political science professor
at Rutgers University.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said any Senate trial would stand in stark contrast to the
sharply partisan battle that took place in the House Judiciary
Committee, mainly because of the closer personal relationships in
the clubby Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tone is completely different,'' he observed.
</P>
<P>
   Senate impeachment trial guidelines envision the Senate chamber
turned into the ultimate federal courtroom, with designated House
members as ``managers'' or prosecutors. The White House would send
its legal team to represent Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Although the rules require that the impeached president be
notified that he must ``appear before the Senate'' to answer the
charges, they allow legal surrogates to go in Clinton's place.
</P>
<P>
   The last _ and only _ president to be tried in the Senate made
no personal appearance. In 1868, President Andrew Johnson escaped
conviction and removal when the Senate fell one vote short of the
two-thirds requirement.
</P>
<P>
   The process begins when the House impeachment managers notify
the Senate that impeachment articles are finalized and the Senate
signifies it is ready to receive them.
</P>
<P>
   When House members bring the impeachment articles over, the
Senate's Sergeant at Arms will proclaim aloud: ``All persons are
commanded to keep silence, on pain of imprisonment, while the House
of Representatives is exhibiting to the Senate of the United States
articles of impeachment against'' Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Although Rehnquist would have the power to delegate the
evidence-gathering role to a committee of senators, it is unlikely
that a presidential impeachment trial would be considered by
anything less than the full Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The rules specify that at 1 p.m. on the day after receiving the
impeachment articles, the Senate will start the trial and continue
``until final judgment shall be rendered.'' Trial days start
promptly at noon.
</P>
<P>
   A Senate impeachment trial resembles a criminal trial. Witnesses
are called, evidence is introduced and the chief justice rules on
lawyers' objections.
</P>
<P>
   The rules require that the senators _ acting as jurors _ sit
silently during the trial. However, unlike jurors in an ordinary
trial, the senators would be allowed to submit written questions
through the chief justice to witnesses and lawyers. Senators irked
by the chief justice's rulings on evidentiary or procedural matters
can call for votes to overturn them.
</P>
<P>
   At the conclusion of the trial, senators would vote on each
article of impeachment separately. The chief justice reads each
article and then calls on individual senators by name. Each then
stands and states ``guilty'' or ``not guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   How long such a trial might last has been the subject of much
debate and speculation. One Clinton attorney, Robert Bennett, said
on CNN's ``Larry King Live'' that a Senate trial could take up to
six months.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, however, has said it could
last anywhere from a few days to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Baker, the Rutgers scholar, predicted the trial would last
somewhere in between those two estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it would be three weeks,'' he said. ``I may be
saying this more out of hope than conviction, but we won't see this
going on when the cherry blossoms come out'' in early spring.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist, 74, has spent 26 years at the Supreme Court, 12 of
them as Chief Justice of the United States. Although he has no
experience presiding over a criminal trial, he has studied
impeachments and written a book about the process, ``Grand
Inquests.''
</P>
<P>
   The book focuses on the 1868 Senate trial of Johnson and the
1805 impeachment of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase. Like
Johnson, Chase narrowly averted removal when the Senate fell short
of the two-thirds majority necessary to remove Chase.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist would have to fit his role as Senate trial judge
around his stewardship of the nation's highest court.
</P>
<P>
   Answering high school students' questions last week, Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor said she doubted the court's routine would be
affected by a Senate trial. ``But the chief justice's certainly
would be,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has conducted 14 impeachment trials, mostly of
federal judges. Seven of those resulted in conviction and removal.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent convictions involved judges Walter Nixon of
Mississippi and Alcee Hastings of Florida, both in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier criminal trial, Nixon was convicted of perjury and
sentenced to five years in prison. His impeachment and conviction
by the Senate removed him from a job he had been appointed to for
life.
</P>
<P>
   Before he was impeached and convicted, Hastings had been
acquitted of federal criminal charges that he conspired with a
lawyer friend to soften a racketeers' sentences in exchange for a
$150,000 bribe.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate nevertheless concluded there was enough evidence to
warrant his removal from the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Hastings, a Democrat, later was elected to the U.S. House of
Representatives, representing a district in South Florida. He has
been an outspoken defender of Clinton.

LONGTIME CLINTON ENEMY NEARS GOAL OF IMPEACHING CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the House Judiciary Committee's approval
Friday of impeachment articles against the president, Republican
committee member Bob Barr passed another milestone in his long
battle to remove Bill Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   His fight began well before the name Monica Lewinsky emerged. In
fact, Barr first called for Clinton's ouster nearly two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1997 he wrote Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde
demanding an impeachment inquiry into allegations that the
president had violated campaign finance laws by illegally accepting
money from foreigners and by giving favorable government treatment
in return for campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Barr continues to argue that the president's alleged offenses
that arose from his affair with the former White House intern pale
in comparison with the alleged campaign finance violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we'll ever get him on all the crimes he has
committed, but the key thing is that we get him,'' he said in an
interview Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   One of the president's most visible critics, Barr has used the
committee's impeachment hearings as a forum to try to convince the
American people that Clinton is guilty of more than lying about
sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be decades before history reveals the vastness of
President Clinton's abuse of power or the extent of the damage it
has wrought,'' he said Friday as the committee debated the
impeachment articles.
</P>
<P>
   Barr, 50, a former Central Intelligence Agency analyst and a
former U.S. attorney, was elected to Congress in 1994, riding a
wave of public sentiment against Clinton and big government.
</P>
<P>
   He became part of the GOP freshman class that helped wrest
control of Congress from the Democrats, who had held power in one
or both houses for four decades.
</P>
<P>
   Barr, who hails from Georgia's conservative 7th Congressional
District outside Atlanta, quickly became a leader in a matter of
symbolic importance to conservatives: He led the drive to rename
Washington National Airport to Reagan National Airport.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 he also wrote the Defense of Marriage Act, which allows
states to refuse to recognize same-sex marriages.
</P>
<P>
   He has opposed increasing the minimum wage, endorsed an
unsuccessful measure to make English the nation's official language
and voted for another unsuccessful bill to repeal the ban on sales
of certain semiautomatic assault weapons.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most conservative members of Congress, he earned a 96
percent rating from the American Conservative Union for his 1997
voting record.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and its allies on Capitol Hill have eagerly
portrayed Barr as a right-winger out to get Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's part of the radical fringe element of the Republican
Party, and he is obsessed with impeaching the president,'' Rep.
John Lewis, D-Ga., a frequent adversary of Barr, said earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Barr maintains that he doesn't take the attacks personally,
saying they are ``part of the White House's scorched-earth policy
that it employs against anybody it feels is threatening.''
</P>
<P>
   He also argues that the reasons for his attacks against Clinton
are not partisan.``I wouldn't have done one thing differently if
this president had been a Republican,'' he said in the interview.

   WASHINGTON _ To hear Rep. Lindsey Graham tell it, his patience
just plain ran out.
</P>
<P>
   After months of public wrangling over whether to oust President
Clinton, Graham, the conservative firebrand on the Judiciary
Committee with a penchant for moderation on the impeachment issue,
went on the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people in America follow Bill Clintonspeak, we're going to
ruin the rule of law, and he's not worth that,'' Graham said to
Clinton's lawyer, Charles Ruff, at a committee hearing on
Wednesday. ``No one person in America is worth trashing out the
rule of law and creating a situation where you can't rely on your
common sense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only believe your defense if I check my common sense at
the door, and I forget the way the world really works,'' he told
Ruff, during a caustic exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, 43, a former Air Force prosecutor from South Carolina,
had long questioned if perjury, the strongest of the impeachment
counts against Clinton, was an offense serious enough to warrant
impeachment. He was also one of the few Republicans who reached out
to Democrats in joint letters, and even voted with them on one
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday Graham joined his 20 Republican colleagues to vote
out of committee the first of four articles of impeachment, the one
alleging that Clinton committed perjury before a grand jury on Aug.
17.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always asked, would this be more like Peyton Place or
Watergate,'' Graham said outside the hearing room. It turned out,
he said, ``to be more like Watergate.''
</P>
<P>
   The clincher, he said, came when Ruff failed to offer a credible
defense of Clinton's actions, the worst of which was not simple
perjury, he said, but using the power of the presidency to try to
smear a witness, Monica Lewinsky, by painting her as a ``sexual
predator.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he treated Monica Lewinsky,'' he said, in
exasperation. ``His political interests were more important than
the truth or welfare of the person he was involved in a sexual
relationship with. He was using the office in a most sinister
way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The country is in trouble when you let politicians use the
resources of their office to crush a citizen that may get in their
way,'' Graham added, presumably to the cheers of many of his
Republican constituents back home.
</P>
<P>
   Graham has always had an unpredictable edge. He is the man who
wanted to oust House Speaker Newt Gingrich last summer, before it
became fashionable to do so.
</P>
<P>
   And earlier this year, when members were scrambling for bits of
``pork'' to haul to their districts in the highway spending bill,
Graham courted the wrath of Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Pa., the
Transportation Committee chairman, and criticized his own party for
engineering the largest public works bill in history.
</P>
<P>
   On the Judiciary Committee, where he is a junior member, Graham
has stood apart from the rest with his vivid, concise remarks, the
kind that make sense to his grandmother at the kitchen table, not
just to a roomful of lawyers. He likes to speak right off the cuff,
without the full text notes that most members would never dare to
ditch.
</P>
<P>
   Graham called Friday's vote one that he would never forget. But
he still held out the prospect that if Clinton 'fessed up to lying
under oath, he would vote for censure on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's fate is in his own hands,'' he said before the
vote. ``Mr. President, you have one more chance. Don't bite your
lip; reconcile yourself with the law.''

By JAMES DAO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As he ponders the complex constitutional,
historical and moral issues at stake in impeaching a president,
Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., says he has tried to clear his mind of
``litter,'' including any thought of politics.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bit like raking leaves in a hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   For Lazio, who wants to run for the Senate in 2000, next week's
expected impeachment vote by the House is about as politically
charged as it gets. A vote to impeach is likely to please the
conservatives who dominate New York's Republican primaries, but
equally likely to incense Democrats who hold a 3 to 2 advantage in
the state's general electorate. A vote against impeachment might
lose him the primary and keep him from reaching the November
sweepstakes at all.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, who will travel with Clinton to Israel on Saturday as a
representative of the House Republican leadership, contends that he
has not been lobbied by either side in the debate and has not
factored electoral calculations into his deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   But he does not deny that political pressures are swirling about
him. ``People advise you on every side of this issue and confuse
you about the political dimensions of the vote,'' he said in an
interview. ``If you allow that to happen, you can be completely
paralyzed.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio is far from alone in his conundrum. In states like
Maryland, Delaware and New Jersey, House members who are
contemplating running for statewide offices like the Senate must
suddenly weigh the broader political fallout of their impeachment
votes. For each member, a decision that receives plaudits from the
hometown crowd might prompt catcalls from a statewide audience.
</P>
<P>
   Like Lazio, many are moderate Republicans from Northeastern
states where Clinton remains popular and impeachment is not. They
are people like Rep. Constance Morella of Maryland and Rep. Michael
Castle of Delaware, who are each thinking of running for the Senate
in 2000 in states where Democrats outnumber Republicans. Both have
said they remain undecided on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   And there is Rep. Robert Franks, a potential candidate for
governor in New Jersey, where Democrats are closely watching his
every move. ``We would make him sorely regret casting a vote for
impeachment,'' said Rick Thigpen, executive director of the New
Jersey state Democratic committee. Franks has said he is leaning
toward voting for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, where a bevy of prominent politicians from both
parties are considering running for Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan's
seat when he retires in 2000, two potential Republican contenders
have already come out against impeachment: Rep. Peter King of Long
Island and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York City. Both said
political considerations played no role in their decisions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lazio, whose Suffolk County district voted overwhelmingly for
Clinton in 1996, has spent much of his three terms weaving a record
that could appeal to New York's raucously diverse electorate, which
tends to be conservative in upstate rural regions and moderate to
liberal in the New York City metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   He often votes with moderates and liberals on abortion and the
environment, but supports the kinds of tax cuts businesses like. He
has fought his own leadership to protect spending for the arts, but
has also become a close ally of the staunchly conservative House
majority leader, Dick Armey of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Some political analysts say that the importance of impeachment
is likely to dim in voters' minds by the 2000 elections. But many
other analysts say that because Lazio is not well known, his
impeachment vote could become the most vivid thing people remember
about him, particularly if impeachment passes the House and leads
to a trial in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said he has tried to blot out political concerns by
focusing on two broader issues: whether Clinton has lost so much
credibility that he can no longer govern effectively; and whether
the House would be setting the right precedent for future
Congresses if it approves impeachment against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people, and I am one, who are concerned about the
slippery slope of denigrating what the truth is,'' he said. ``One
of the questions in my mind is, `Have we thrown the towel in on
public ethics? Do we have respect for the truth?'''
</P>
<P>
   He said he has twice before faced votes that he thought might
imperil his political future: when he voted for the North American
Free Trade Agreement, which angered labor unions, and when he voted
for a ban on assault weapons, which riled the National Rifle
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is anything I've learned from these experience, it is
you just have to clear your head and make the most decent, solid,
right decision that you can make,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said he still believed the president has not owned up to
his misleading statements about his affair with Monica Lewinsky.
The president would help himself with wavering members of Congress,
Lazio said, if he simply used two words: ``I lied.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is clarity with the word,'' Lazio said, adding that he
would tell the president his feelings on the trip to Israel, if
asked. ``There is in the end some honesty with the word. It's
almost a matter of dignity for the office, the Congress and the
American people.''

BRUINS FACE A ROUGH PATCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN VELLANTE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Bruins have played just 10 games in the past 29
days.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 19 days, they will play 10 times.
</P>
<P>
   And that's something coach Pat Burns welcomes. So does Hal Gill.
And Kyle McLaren makes three.
</P>
<P>
   The season's busiest stretch begins Saturday night at the
FleetCenter, where the Bruins entertain the Buffalo Sabres in a key
Eastern Conference game.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after three days off, the Bruins really put the pedal to
the metal. From Wednesday, when they're in Detroit, to Dec. 31,
when they're in Dallas, they play for keeps nine times.
</P>
<P>
   Gone for the rest of the season are those stretches in which the
Bruins would have three or four days off between games. That's
happened six times already this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're playing with a certain confidence (and the Bruins
are oozing it during their 6-0-2 streak), when you practice a lot,
the message sometimes just doesn't get there,'' said Burns.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're looking for things you want to work with _ and there's
always things you have to work on _ but I think the players feel
sometimes that things are going well, so why are we doing this
again? There's a little bit of human nauture involved in there,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have started slowly the past two games against
Pittsburgh and Carolina after layoffs of three and four days, and
Burns warns against that happening against Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we start late (Saturday), we're done,'' he said. ``We have
to come out at the drop of the puck. Buffalo is playing so
confident right now. (Dominik) Hasek is, well, what more can you
say? He's one of the top (goalies). This is the two best defensive
teams going at it, and it's going to be inch for inch and very
tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying we pack the tents, go home, and give them the 2
points if Buffalo scores a quick goal. But it puts you in a
position where you're going to have to battle back. It's very
important that at the drop of the puck, everybody's ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Gill is ready for more of the real stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to play back-to-back too often,'' he said,
``but you want to get in a rhythm and get out there. A lot of times
when you're practicing too long, you get, you know, not lazy, but
you're not as sharp.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're playing every other day, or back-to-back, you get
into a rhythm and you feel good out there. The practices aren't
that bad, either. You just go out there, work up a good sweat, and
you're ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Gill says the recent unbeaten streak (the Bruins haven't lost
since Nov. 14) has the team playing with confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel good about what's happening,'' he said. ``(Against
Carolina) we came out with a good win. We had a bad first period,
but we had that confidence and knew we could win. We didn't have
any doubts in our minds.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaren, like Gill, prefers the upcoming schedule to what's been
played.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, especially when you're on a roll,'' said McLaren. ``You
want to keep playing games. No team wants to be sitting around too
long like we have. The more games, the better, because then you
really have no time to relax.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always going mentally. It's good, like I said,
especially when you're on a roll. All you want to do is keep
playing games to keep the ball rolling.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaren loves what he sees the Bruins doing lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a patient team and you've seen the last few games that
we're going to stick around right to the end of the third period.
This team is playing with a lot of confidence, and I think a lot of
that comes from our goaltending. It's been brilliant. Both
goaltenders. It starts from the back up. The chemistry is there,
and with that comes the confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   A four-week unbeaten streak helps, too.

WITH SULLIVAN OUT, PATRIOTS JUGGLE THE LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN

<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Todd Collins was explaining how it's not all
that strenuous ``to run downfield on the special teams and then go
out on the next play and take your position at linebacker'' when
Marty Moore reached his locker, next to Collins's.
</P>
<P>
   Moore overheard Collins's last words: ``You just have to suck it
up. You're in condition throughout the season and throughout the
year. It's not that big a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   A media member baited Moore, saying his next-door neighbor was
saying that just about any football player could do what Moore was
forced to do last week in Pittsburgh. Moore listened intently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aw,'' said Moore, ``you just have to catch your breath. As
long as I catch my breath, I'll be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' said Collins, backtracking graciously, ``this guy had to
play every (special-teams) play last week and then go out for the
next play. When I had to do it, I was only on one special teams.
Marty's on all four of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The two bantered.
</P>
<P>
   ``So me and Todd are going to rotate (Sunday) and keep each
other fresh,'' said Moore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' said Collins. ``I'll have the oxygen tank ready for
Marty.''
</P>
<P>
   With the loss of Ted Johnson for the season last Sunday, the
Patriots are in the midst of a new linebacking plan, one that is
unusual because of the rotation that will be required.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, an outside linebacker, will rotate with Moore at middle
linebacker and also fill in for Tedy Bruschi at left outside
linebacker. Moore, a special-teams stalwart, will continue on all
four special teams (kickoff returns and kickoff coverage, punt
returns and punt coverage) but also will see the bulk of the work
at middle linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Collins played inside linebacker, the Patriots
were in a 3-4 defense and his partner on the inside ``was Vincent
(Brown).'' That long ago.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Moore started a game at middle linebacker was way
back when . . . when? ``I think it was in 1995 . . . in San
Francisco,'' said Moore. ``Then I played the game against Denver
(Oct. 8). It's been a while.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I'm not going to tell you who's going to start
yet,'' coach Pete Carroll said. ``But right now Marty's a bit ahead
of Todd in making the calls and doing all the things he needs to do
at the spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``With that, we're still going to rotate them because I still
want Marty to be in on all the special teams. It's going to take a
couple of weeks before Marty really feels comfortable there, but
he'll do fine. But right now I think Marty's a notch ahead of Todd
assignmentwise and in his ability to make all the calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins, an inside linebacker in college (``We played a 3-4
defense''), played that position for New England in a 3-4 defense,
but Bill Parcells switched him outside in 1995 after Collins took a
year off from football. ``Making the calls (in the huddle) is no
big thing,'' said Collins, ``but your responsibilities are so
different in the middle from the outside.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Patriot defense now is a 4-3, with four linemen and
three linebackers.
</P>
<P>
   Both Collins and Moore expect that Collins will be at middle
linebacker on the first play or two after a Patriot punt or
kickoff, allowing Moore time to rest from his special-teams duties,
but then Moore will replace him. Collins also expects that he will
be asked to spell Bruschi at times at the outside spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's how we're going to work it,'' said Moore.
``Right after a kickoff, Todd's going to be in there and then I'm
going to come in after that. It's kind of up to the coaches on how
they want to rotate us and up to Todd and me on how we want to
catch our breath.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore's responsibilities on kickoffs and punts are, as he put
it, ``just get to the ball.'' Which, of course, is precisely the
responsibility of the middle linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   There can be at least 20 special-teams plays a game, and with
the added load of taking most snaps on defense, ``I'm just going to
have to get ready for all the work,'' said Moore. ``But I'm
ready.''

 &HT;    Famous author's cottage gets facelift
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COCONUT GROVE, Fla. _ Sunlight filters through the dense canopy
of Marjory Stoneman Douglas' rain forest of a back yard, dappling
the brown fallen leaves and dense green undergrowth.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing stirs but the hint of a Biscayne Bay breeze, that and
the plop of a few stray drops from fat leaves far overhead, remnant
of a South Florida morning shower.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the tiny English-style cottage, light streams through the
east-facing windows, illuminating the plank floor, the faded couch
and the simple wicker chairs arranged around a comfortably worn
rug.
</P>
<P>
   The cottage's famous inhabitant departed a half-year ago,
passing away after a remarkable life of 108 years that saw her give
a lasting nickname to one of the world's most unique natural
features while spawning an international movement to rescue it from
the predations of human progress.
</P>
<P>
   Long before there was an environmental movement, Douglas'
influential 1947 book, ``The Everglades: River of Grass,'' led to
the creation of Everglades National Park. Her insights into the
inter-connected web of the giant swamp's life predated the most
basic tenets of what has become modern environmental consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas penned the work _ and her other books _ at the sturdy
desk in one corner of the modest cottage she built in 1926. She
lived there, uninterrupted, for 72 years until her death in May.
</P>
<P>
   She had sold the 1,000-square-foot bungalow and the small
surrounding lot to the state in 1990, with the understanding that
she could live there until her death. Now the Land Trust of Dade
County, a private preservation group, is gathering funds for the
home's upkeep and to build a small educational center nearby as a
tribute to Douglas' life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to restore the interior space of the house, which
is very small,'' said Sallye Jude, president of the trust. ``There
will be limited visitation by appointment because the house is so
small.''
</P>
<P>
   The Douglas home is located in the heart of Miami's charming
Coconut Grove section, a half-mile up the slope from Biscayne Bay
in an area where dense vegetation still gives a hint of the
primeval Florida that Douglas loved.
</P>
<P>
   When she built it, Miami was already a boom town thriving with
tourists, but far smaller than the sprawling metropolis of today.
Over the years the tide of development washed over Coconut Grove
and Douglas' cottage and on to the borders of the Everglades, 20
miles to the west.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas was a character, even somewhat eccentric, say those who
knew her. Daughter of one of the founders of the Miami Herald
newspaper, she divorced in her 20s, when such things were a
scandal. She then carved out a career as a writer, first at the
newspaper, and later on her own, writing novels, plays and
nonfiction.
</P>
<P>
   Her home is now surrounded by million-dollar mansions in one of
Miami's most prominent neighborhoods. It sits, slightly bedraggled,
far back on a grassy lot, shaded by towering trees roped with thick
green vines. There is no driveway because Douglas didn't drive.
</P>
<P>
   Duck beneath the overhanging bushes, slip past the house to
Douglas' back yard and the vegetation grows in unchecked riot, a
hint of what the area resembled when only Indians called it home.
</P>
<P>
   But only a hint: 20 yards from Douglas' back patio shimmers the
blue water of her back-lot neighbor's swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the house is something of an oasis, a shrine that
breathes with the spirit of its departed master.
</P>
<P>
   Its cedar shingles are tawny with moss, its white stucco walls
decorated with spalted wooden planks. The eaves curve down over the
doors and windows with such exaggeration they give the feel of a
house for little people in some English fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the house is basically one big living room with
head-high bookshelves lining one wall, the desk in one corner and a
heavy table on the opposite wall. On the table is a driftwood
sculpture on which perch two carved flamingos. Stuck on other knobs
are two of Douglas' famous hats, wide-brimmed and tied with white
sashes.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the house consists of two tiny bedrooms, an equally
tiny kitchen with a hot plate _ no stove because Douglas liked to
eat out, not cook _ and a bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Like Jefferson's Monticello or Faulkner's Rowan Oak, the house
reflects its master. With Douglas, that means simplicity: she was
known for her straight-forward candor, her imperviousness to the
pretensions of the high and mighty of business or politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marjory was a very private person,'' Jude said. ``The
instruction she gave the architect when she built the house was, `I
want something functional.'''
</P>
<P>
   The house will now be preserved as a monument to her life and
legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Work on the education center is expected to take about a year,
with an opening sometime in late 1999. It is doubtful that the home
itself will be open to the general public except by appointment,
although there may be a walkway to allow visitors to peer in
through the windows.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors may appreciate it best if they arrive on a quiet
morning with few others around. Stand in the silence and you can
almost see the tiny figure treading the plank floor, gazing out the
windows into the streaming light, embracing the beauty of the
nature she so loved.
</P>

sent to:

BLEDSOE TO WEAR DIFFERENT CAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Drew Bledsoe confirmed Friday that doctors
inserted pins into the top joint of his broken right index finger
Tuesday at Massachusetts General Hospital. The Patriots quarterback
said the procedure was performed because his finger ``wasn't
healing because the bone had displaced.''
</P>
<P>
   He took snaps with his left hand Friday and did not throw the
ball, on doctors' orders. When asked if he knew whether he would be
able to pass effectively Sunday against the Rams, he laughed off
the question, saying, ``I don't . . . but I don't see how it could
be worse. But I feel confident. It's at least as good as last week,
and probably better.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe said he would wear a ``long splint'' in Sunday's game,
one that covers the top of his finger as well as the knuckle area.
He wore a shorter splint in the game against Buffalo and for the
first three quarters in Pittsburgh last Sunday but was forced to go
to a longer splint when he lost feeling in the top of his finger at
the start of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing now is that that last joint is going to heal in
its proper place,'' said Bledsoe. Inserting two pins into the top
of his finger, he said, effectively results ``in an interior
splint. This will hold it in place so that it heals properly and
heals quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe said it might have been wiser to have worn a longer
splint from the start, ``but I asked the doctors to cut it down so
I could have more feeling'' at the tip of his finger to aid his
passing touch.
</P>
<P>
   As for the exact procedure, Bledsoe described it this way:
``They went into the top of the finger and stuck a couple of pins
in there to hold the two fragments (of bone) in place. They said it
was going to be a splint, just that the splint is inside.''

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 13)  
 (af)  
 By CAROLE GOULD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   European stocks of many different stripes are benefiting from
the impending debut of the euro. But for William Lovering,
co-manager of the $85.1 million Bartlett Europe fund, the trick is
to find the companies that are likely to benefit the most.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been strong monetary stimulation in what we call the
peripheral European economies _ Ireland, Spain, Portugal and
especially Italy _ because their central banks have to convert to
interest rates at the levels in Germany and France,'' Lovering said
from his office in central London.
</P>
<P>
   But Lovering sees many reasons for optimism, especially the
European banks' coordinated interest-rate cuts on Dec. 3. ``What
the central banks have done is show their commitment to making the
European club work, and recognized the generally weaker
international economic environment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that European companies are only now beginning the
type of restructuring that their American counterparts endured
years ago. ``The bottoms-up story in Europe is the changing shape
of businesses and balance sheets,'' he said, ``and the recognition
that shareholders are important.''
</P>
<P>
   Lovering, 33, and his co-manager, Neil Worsley, 38, ran
Worldwide Value, the closed-end predecessor of Bartlett Europe,
from 1994 and 1992, respectively. It was converted to a mutual fund
in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In its new form, the fund levies a maximum initial sales charge,
or load, of 4.75 percent. The pair work for Lombard Odier
International Portfolio Management, a subsidiary of Lombard Odier,
a Swiss bank.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny fund has posted some impressive results. Bartlett
Europe has returned an annual average of 27.2 percent for the three
years through Dec. 4, ranking first among the 46 European stock
funds tracked by Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher. The
average return for the category was 18.7 percent, Morningstar said.
</P>
<P>
   Lovering, who speaks English, French and what he called
``restaurant German and Italian,'' travels to Europe for a week
every month. ``You're never going to learn a lot that's new,'' he
said, ``but we make sure the momentum in restructuring is
maintained, and we often get good information about prices when one
of our companies supplies another.''
</P>
<P>
   Lombard Odier also employs 32 analysts in London, Amsterdam and
Geneva, who collectively make more than 1,000 company visits a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Lovering considers himself and Worsley ``growth at a reasonable
price'' investors, seeking growing earnings and per-share cash
flow, but paying attention to the relative prices of stocks. ``It's
becoming increasingly easier because more companies are reporting
on a like-to-like basis, so you can compare valuations across
borders,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the European Monetary Union, the two managers view
Europe as three distinct regions rather than as individual
countries. Each region makes up about a third of the fund's
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   The managers consider ``core Europe'' _ France, Germany and
Switzerland _ the lower-growth area because these countries ``are
coming off the back of pretty bad recessions,'' Lovering said. But
the region will still be profitable for the fund because of
mergers, restructurings and corporate efficiency drives, he said _
DaimlerChrysler being the best-known in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But there are still strong growth opportunities in the region,
Lovering said, including SAP of Germany, Europe's largest
information technology company and the leader in enterprise
resource planning software worldwide. The fund started buying SAP
in June 1997 at a price of 300 marks a share. It closed Friday at
625 marks, and Lovering predicts it will pass 900 marks within the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Lovering is especially optimistic about peripheral Europe. ``The
economies are enjoying strong stimulus from easing monetary
conditions,'' he said. In Italy, for example, interest rates have
dropped to below 4 percent from more than 10 percent four years
ago, Lovering said, pushing Italians out of bank accounts and into
mutual funds and equities.
</P>
<P>
   He aims to capture that trend by owning banks and insurance
companies. Bartlett holds Unicredito Italiano, created by the
recent merger of Unicredito and Credito Italiano and now one of the
largest providers of financial services in Italy. Lovering said
Bartlett Europe started purchasing the stock in September 1997 at
1,200 lire and he thinks it could hit 9,000 in 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   The final region is just one country, Britain, which Lovering
said has lagged behind other European markets this year. ``Our
interest-rate environment was different because rates were
rising,'' he said, ``and because Britain wasn't joining the
European Community at the first opportunity, international
investors were concentrating their firepower elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he added, there are opportunities among individual
companies. ``Some companies are performing because British
management is more akin to U.S. management,'' he said, ``and
companies here have been restructuring over the last four years.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other British companies, he owns Railtrack, the recently
privatized railroad company. ``We like its very secure earnings and
understated profit potential because it is a regulated industry,''
he said. ``It has been under-invested and badly managed over the
past 20 to 30 years, so there is room for growth going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Lovering started buying the stock in February 1998 at around 9
pounds a share. Now at 14.01 pounds, it should hit 17.50 pounds in
12 months, he said.

TICKING OFF TRENDY TIMEKEEPERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ever notice how the December issues of fashion
mags are always filled with the faces of time? Some watchmakers
feature their wares next to the faces of supermodels like Cindy
Crawford, others let the wristwatches stand alone as works of art.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, a watch fits all sizes. Another good thing: They're
can be easily exchanged.
</P>
<P>
   On that timely subject, Cartier has reintroduced its now-famous
Santos watch created by Louis Cartier for aviator Alberto
Santos-Dumont in 1904. It was the first wristwatch, still looks
stylish in steel and gold, and is available at Cartier and Saks
Fifth Avenue stores in Beverly Hills for $3,100.
</P>
<P>
   Too pricey? Don't get ticked off.
</P>
<P>
   Miz Hot Tips discovered Anne Klein has several new styles for
the holidays, perhaps inspired by the Santos, for about $150. And
Fossil, known for retro designs packaged in tin boxes, has its own
version of a sporty steel and gold-toned watch (it looks more like
a Rolex) priced under $100. Both brands are available at
fashion-savvy stores like Robinsons-May and Macy's.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a trendie, you probably know the G-Shock watch has
cooled down. Now it's the Spoon.
</P>
<P>
   Made by Pulsar, Spoon watches have all kinds of cool novelties,
including monitor-screen-shaped dial openings, and red display
lights; and coming soon will be more insane styles, including a
model that can scroll up to 100 different messages across the dial.
</P>
<P>
   Spoon fans include the cast members of ``Clueless,'' ``Moesha,''
and ``Dharma &AMP; Greg,'' as well as actors Vivica Fox, Teri Hatcher,
Jack Nicholson and Billy Zane. Spoons are also hot with bands Third
Eye Blind, No Doubt, The Crystal Method, Eve 6 and Pharcyde.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find Spoons for $100 to $175 at American Rag and Fred
Segal in Los Angeles, and Barneys in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   She hasn't seen a single celeb wearing one, but Miz Hot Tips
thinks the new Scooby-Doo watch by Armitron is doggone cute for
only $20. For the totally clueless, Scooby-Doo is a cartoon that's
been on the tube since 1969 and features a dog who helps his humans
chase ghosts and bad guys. Look for it in adult- and kid-size
versions at most department stores.
</P>
<P>
   PURSE PANACHE: Knowing that lottery winners often have to work
hard at spending their big bucks, Miz Hot Tips shopped around and
found something worthy. It's Vivian Alexander's bejeweled and
enameled evening bags made from real ostrich eggs (they look like
Faberge eggs), so you know it's too small for a cell phone and
compact. But hey, everyone will ooh and ahh over it, which has
gotta be worth the $6,000 you'll pay at the David Orgell store in
Beverly Hills. P.S.: They do have a few priced at $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   WARM AND FUZZY: By now, you've noticed Miz Hot Tips rarely gives
practical tips, but if you really do need a hot-water bottle, read
on. Saks Fifth Avenue has a faux fur model for $75 that looks like
real mink.
</P>
<P>
   THE OFFICE BUZZ: Being in the loop is such a big deal these
days. It requires constant back watching, major suck-up skills, and
fluency in corporate jargon and doublespeak. For the latter,
consider ``The Buzzword Bingo Book'' (Villard; $9.95) as your
textbook.
</P>
<P>
   The new paperback by Lara Stein and Benjamin Yoskovitz is a fun
read with a glossary of terms you'll want to tackle. Among them are
``heritage,'' which means a company's cultural history, otherwise
known as baggage; and ``Hollywired,'' which means the impending
mega-marriage of interactive technology and the entertainment
industry. Miz Hot Tips' personal fave is ``idea hamster,'' a person
who drives others crazy because they're always in hyperdrive with
tons of ideas to share at staff meetings.

GOVERNMENT MAY TAKE OVER SECOND LARGE BANK 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By SHERLY WuDUNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The government appears to be on the verge of
nationalizing a second large Japanese bank, Nippon Credit Bank, in
a move that may foreshadow a wider cleanup of the banking system
and a tougher stance by financial authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese government has been under pressure to be more
assertive in confronting the country's economic troubles and
banking crisis, and a takeover of Nippon Credit, which has about
$100 billion in assets, would presumably be welcomed by the
financial community as a sign that the authorities will move more
decisively to resolve their banking problems.
</P>
<P>
   Nippon Credit has resisted the move, but the government can
effectively force it to accept nationalization.
</P>
<P>
   If the government chooses to take control of Nippon Credit, it
would be the second bank taken over. The authorities in October
nationalized Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, which is about twice
the size of Nippon Credit. A decision on the Nippon Credit takeover
could come over the weekend, according to a senior government
official who asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Both Nippon Credit and the government publicly denied the move
Friday. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told reporters that he had
heard nothing about the government's leaning toward nationalizing
Nippon Credit.
</P>
<P>
   Nippon Credit's financial troubles have been well known for more
than a year, and by some estimates its bad debts are so large that
if accounted for by the rules they would put the bank into
insolvency. Just over a year ago, Nippon Credit was rescued with an
injection of nearly $2.5 billion from the Bank of Japan and a
collection of Japanese financial institutions. Then this March, the
bank received a further $510 million in public funds.
</P>
<P>
   Some financial officials may use the aid as leverage to push for
stiffer standards for banks' financial cushions against loan
losses. Many financial experts argue that the amount of public
funds injected into the banking system in March was too little to
alleviate the banks' capital adequacy problems, and this may
strengthen the hand of officials who want the banks to accept more
public funds under the $510 billion bailout program set up in
October.
</P>
<P>
   Nippon Credit has apparently fiercely resisted nationalization,
but it appears that the bank may lose the battle.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent audit of Nippon Credit, the Financial Supervisory
Agency, which inspects banks, discovered that the bank did not have
enough in reserve to cover the possible loan losses already on its
books, according to a report by the Kyodo News Service. The news
service said the audit showed Nippon Credit officials had
exaggerated the value of real estate held as collateral for the
loans. The government said the agency's definition of bad loans was
much stricter than that of the bank.
</P>
<P>
   In its earnings report for the six months ended Sept. 30, Nippon
Credit said bad loans amounted to $15 billion, but other estimates
put the figure at $27 billion, according to Japanese news reports.
Nippon Credit, which has pulled out of international business, said
it easily met government rules for capital adequacy for domestic
banks. It has also said that by the end of the current fiscal year
on March 31, 1999, it will write off bad loans worth $6.3 billion,
a sum that is about equivalent to its capital base.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of nationalization might be crucial in avoiding
marketwide jitters. The benchmark Nikkei average of 225 stocks has
been buoyant in recent weeks, and even as reports about the
possible nationalization arose near the close of the trading
session, Nippon Credit's stock price held its own. It ended Friday
at 158 yen, down 5 yen.
</P>
<P>
   Since the government is unlikely to pay the market price, Nippon
Credit's shares are expected to plunge. But because the bank's
problems were well known, and because it would be the second
government bank takeover, a nationalization of Nippon Credit might
not precipitate a stock market plunge, as happened in the case of
Long-Term Credit.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Credit's stock price tumbled last spring after rumors
arose that it might face challenges in meeting its financing needs.
The jitters spilled over to other Japanese banks, provoking a
crisis of confidence that eventually forced the government to draw
up its plan to stabilize the banking system, including, if needed,
putting banks under temporary state control. Nippon Credit,
however, has faced no major financing shortages.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is something magical about complete ignorance of a sport.
No one has any expectations of your performance, including
yourself. Everything is fresh and new. Even the pain.
</P>
<P>
   I renewed my acquaintance with that magic on a recent sparkling
weekend in the Catskills, with my first ever cyclocross race.
</P>
<P>
   Cyclocross (known simply as ``cross'' to its devotees) is one of
those bizarre sports that blend seemingly unblendable activities,
like the Olympic biathlon combination of cross-country skiing and
target shooting. In this case, it's a merger of cycling and
hurdling. Basically participants ride a largely off-road circuit of
rock, grass and mud. Races consist of loops of the circuit for some
predetermined period of time, usually 45 minutes or an hour. When
the time is up, a bell rings and the racers give all they have left
for one last lap.
</P>
<P>
   Some riders use mountain bikes, but purists ride modified road
bikes equipped with nubbly but still narrow tires. Real cross bikes
are faster than any mountain bike and far more difficult to control
on steep, slippery downhills.
</P>
<P>
   But that's only half of this sport.
</P>
<P>
   The other half is that low barriers like those in a steeplechase
litter the course. Accomplished riders approach the obstacles at
full speed, brake at the last second, dismount running and raise
the bike over their shoulders, leap like gazelles over the
barriers, fluidly put the bike back down and dash along next to it
until still in one smooth, unbroken flow of motion they jump, kick
their heels up behind them, and then bring their legs forward in a
V that lands them in the saddle, feet pedaling instantaneously.
</P>
<P>
   And what do 38-year-old absolute beginners do, I wondered, as my
determination to try cross solidified with the waning of both the
year and my athletic energy.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, I discovered just minutes into my race, was: brake
just in time to avoid hitting the barrier (usually). Heave the bike
any old way, forgetting the clever grip that makes the lift easier.
Raise one exhausted leg over the obstacle. Follow with the other.
Try not to trip. Try not to curse and/or grunt too loudly. Put the
bike down. Fling a leg over and slam the pedal against the shin.
Grunt and/or curse at high volume. Find the pedal and push off.
Repeat. I hadn't thought to be biking this late in the season. All
things considered, the year already ranked as terrific for cycling,
with a week of bike camping in Montana and a personal record of
three centuries. (OK, one was a metric century: 100 kilometers,
only 60 miles. But still.)
</P>
<P>
   And I had finished up or thought I had with a late-season bike
weekend at a sports training center in the Catskills, which added a
certain finesse to my group riding, a little snap to my turns, some
vigor in my accelerations. Then the bike mavens at the place, Mike
Fraysse's Sports Resort in Glen Spey, N.Y., (914-856-3335) started
talking about cyclocross.
</P>
<P>
   Fraysse (rhymes with crazy) is a manic two-time Olympic cycling
coach whose mind is as full of cycling expertise, gossip and trivia
as his Victorian mansion is with historic cycling paraphernalia.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran racer, Fraysse said cyclocross was born in Europe as a
training tool for road racers to maintain strength through the
off-season, when snow, ice and wind-chill kept them off their usual
routes. Straining their bikes over grass and through muddy fields,
and jumping off to carry them over unridable patches, kept riders
warm and toned. And the intensity of the effort required meant that
an hour or so of cyclocross would be sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the format was popular enough to attract racers, and in
1950 the first World Championships were held in Paris. In the
1970s, cyclocross racing began taking off in the United States, but
the mountain biking craze of the last decade or so stole some of
its thunder. According to the U.S. Cycling Federation, its
popularity is returning, particularly in the Northeast, the
Northwest and in Northern California.

CLINTON MAKES FRESH APOLOGY AS IMPEACHMENT DRIVE PROCEEDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL and JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton expressed fresh regret Friday for
his conduct in the Monica Lewinsky affair but his last-ditch
remorse failed to stop the House Judiciary Committee from voting
for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, standing in the twilight in the Rose Garden of the
White House, said that he was ``profoundly sorry'' for words and
deeds that brought the nation to the brink of the first impeachment
trial in the Senate since the 1860s.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-led House Judiciary Committee never broke stride,
voting 21-16 along party lines just minutes after Clinton's address
to approve the first of four articles of impeachment against the
second-term president.
</P>
<P>
   Republican members of the panel said they were unimpressed by
Clinton's remarks, particularly since the president failed to
publicly admit that he had lied in sworn testimony _ the crux of
the GOP case for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, said the president's remarks would
not have ``any effect'' on the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ``continues to refuse to take responsibility for actions
that could put him in criminal jeopardy,'' Chabot said. ``What the
president really should do for this country is resign.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., who called for Clinton's ouster long
before impeachment proceedings began last month, said that Clinton
``basically continues to thumb his nose at the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr added: ``The juxtaposition of sitting here on the verge of
voting on impeachment while the president continued to dance around
the issue was surrealistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats disagreed. Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., who has
argued that Clinton's infractions are not grounds for impeachment,
said the president made ``a fulsome apology'' that would resonate
well with the American public.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans ``won't be satisfied with this'' because Clinton has
not admitted lying under oath, Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass., said he remained convinced that the
21 Republicans on the Judiciary Committee have been planning to
``vote to impeach since September.''
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee's action set the stage for House
consideration of impeachment next week. Clinton was scheduled to
leave Washington early Saturday for a four-day trip to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides said the president and his senior aides would
spend the coming days privately urging moderate Republicans to
reject the Judiciary Committee's recommendation that the House vote
to impeach Clinton and refer the case to the Senate for trial.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stood before the White House colonnade outside the Oval
Office to offer his latest expression of regret.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want the American people to know, what I want the
Congress to know, is that I am profoundly sorry for all I have done
wrong in words and deeds,'' Clinton said, his eyes rimmed red and
welling with what appeared to be tears. ``I never should have
misled the country, the Congress, my friends or my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton added: ``I would have given anything to go back and undo
what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he was ``ready to accept'' a ``rebuke and censure''
by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not mention the word ``impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor did he admit to lying before a federal grand jury in
testimony on Aug. 17 or in a civil deposition in the Paula Jones
sexual harassment case in January.
</P>
<P>
   As in the past, Clinton held up his private pain within his
family as a stiffer form of punishment for having carried on an
extramarital affair than anything impending from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Painful though the condemnation of the Congress would be, it
would pale in comparison to the consequences of the pain I have
caused my family,'' Clinton said, biting his lip. ``There is no
greater agony.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been refining his apology to the nation ever since
an angry Aug. 17 nationally televised address after more than four
hours of grueling videotaped testimony before the grand jury called
by special prosecutor Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   In that first admission, Clinton abandoned eight months of
denials to admit for the first time that he had carried on a
relationship with Lewinsky that was ``not appropriate _ in fact it
was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton added: ``I misled people, including even my wife. I
deeply regret that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton revised his apology on Aug. 28 during a 12-day vacation
on Martha's Vineyard, Mass., when he told a predominantly
African-American congregation at a local church: ``All of you know
I'm having to become quite an expert in this business of asking for
forgiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was forced to return to the issue during a joint news
conference with Russian President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow on Sept.
2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have acknowledged that I made a mistake, said that I
regretted it, asked to be forgiven, spent a lot of very valuable
time with my family in the last couple of weeks and said I was
going back to work,'' Clinton replied to a question.

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, during a photo session with Irish Prime Minister
Bertie Ahern in Dublin, Clinton reacted to a condemnation of his
behavior by a prominent Democratic ally, Sen. Joseph Lieberman,
D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already said that I made a bad mistake, it was
indefensible and I'm sorry about it.'' It was the first time that
Clinton used the word ``sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 9 in Orlando, Fla., Clinton addressed Democratic
donors, saying: ``I ask you for your understanding, for your
forgiveness.'' Clinton added: ``I also let you down and I let my
family down and I let this country down. But I'm trying to make it
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton apologized in person to his Cabinet at a private meeting
on Sept. 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shared his feelings and apologized to us personally,''
Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 11, Clinton offered one of his most dramatic apologies
to religious leaders gathered in the East Room of the White House
for an annual prayer breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is a fancy way to say that I have
sinned,'' Clinton said, his eyes welling with tears. ``It is
important to me that everybody who has been hurt know that the
sorrow that I feel is genuine _ first and most important for my
family. Also my friends, my staff, my Cabinet, Monica Lewinsky and
her family and the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   His remarks on Sept. 11 were the first time that the president
mentioned Lewinsky by name in his apologies.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Rose Garden appearance Friday, Clinton's most recent
mention of forgiveness came on Tuesday when he joked that Sen. Dale
Bumpers, D-Ark., also a former governor of Arkansas, always
introduced Clinton as only ``the second best'' governor of
Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to forgive him _ for one thing I'm in this sort of
forgiveness mode,'' Clinton said. ``And I forgive him because it's
probably true.''

   WASHINGTON _ The four articles of impeachment being considered
by the House Judiciary Committee contain only the barest hint of
the long-running investigation into the role of President Clinton
and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, in a complicated Arkansas
real-estate deal.
</P>
<P>
   The only trace of the Whitewater investigation, almost a hidden
reference, is buried in Article III. That article, which involves
obstruction of justice, refers to allegations that Clinton tried
through his ``agents'' to find a job for Monica Lewinsky to help
secure her acquiescence in concealing their sexual relationship.
That issue has nothing itself to do with Whitewater, of course, but
it is a reminder of how the investigation into the land deal led in
fits and starts to the sex-and-lies scandal that is at the heart of
the impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The reference to ``agents'' refers most prominently to Vernon
Jordan, a well-connected Washington lawyer and good friend of
Clinton, who worked hard to to find a job for Ms. Lewinsky in New
York City that she would find satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
   Article III contains the charge that beginning in December 1997
and continuing through January 1998, Clinton ``intensified and
succeeded in an effort to secure job assistance to a witness in a
federal civil rights action against him in order to corruptly
prevent the truthful testimony of that witness.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee's chief Democratic counsel, Abbe Lowell, argued at
length Friday that Jordan's efforts were not designed to buy Ms.
Lewinsky's silence. Rather, he contended, the job search in which
Jordan aided Ms. Lewinsky began well before she had been subpoenaed
in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   But Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr saw Jordan's efforts in a
different light. He used them as the justification for expanding
his Whitewater investigation to include the president's
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, arguing that the job help
paralleled earlier efforts by the president's allies, including
Jordan, to provide help to an important Whitewater witness, Webster
Hubbell. After he was forced to leave the Clinton administration,
Hubbell received several lucrative contracts, some with the
assistance of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has contended in court papers that Hubbell has been
concealing important information about the Clintons' involvement in
Whitewater.
</P>
<P>
   If Whitewater figures only indirectly in the impeachment
articles, the other avenues of Starr's investigation are wholly
nonexistent. Starr told the Judiciary committee last month that he
had found no wrongdoing on the part of President or Mrs. Clinton in
dismissing a group of longtime employees in the White House travel
office or in the improper collection by the Clinton White House of
some 900 confidential FBI files, many of them on prominent
Republicans.

`LEAR, MY DEAR'? HOW VERY, VERY QUEER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BETTY COMDEN and ADOLPH GREEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The history of the theater is dotted with musical
shows the sneering multitudes proclaimed would never open.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of the musicalization of Shakespeare's ``King
Lear'' titled ``Lear, My Dear.'' First, five of the principals died
during rehearsal, a definite setback. Then the twelve-tone serial
score a la Schoenberg, struck many potential backers as hopelessly
unwhistlable and they withdrew the $8 million budgeted for the
production. Fortunately a deaf uncle of the lyricist came through
and took up the slack and it was all speed ahead.
</P>
<P>
   As for the scoffers who said it would never open, it not only
opened at the Imperial Theater, but would also have run for three
full performances, were it not for the angry audience uprising that
broke out during the third night near the end of Act II. The fact
that it ran as long as it did can be attributed only to the casting
of Bernadette Peters as the aging monarch.
</P>
<P>
   How is it that a musical about a sharp-shooting female will run
considerably longer, with the very same star, than one based on a
beloved Shakespeare classic? Is it subject matter that determines
success or failure in the musical theater?
</P>
<P>
   There are certain subjects in literature and history positively
guaranteed to be totally unfit for the musical stage. Any
self-respecting theater practitioner would know in a sniff that the
following are ludicrous choices for musical comedy: the signing of
the Declaration of Independence, the bloodthirsty murderous barber
Sweeney Todd and the sinking of the Titanic. Yet they have all been
considerably more successful than the late nonlamented ``Lear, My
Dear.''
</P>
<P>
   Why? Let's say the the Three Norns _ the three goddesses of the
past, present and future who play with mortals' destiny _ got
together for lunch at Sardi's and over a dish of cannelloni got a
little tipsy and gave those shows their blessing.
</P>
<P>
   This may seem nonintellectual, nonanalytical and evasive in the
extreme, but there is no other explanation ... except of course for
the skill and imagination and artistry of the creators who
stubbornly refused to listen to reason.
</P>
<P>
   Some years ago we refused to listen to reason, and while looking
desperately for a story about a strong woman in a male-dominated
world, we suddenly saw a flash of lightning spelling out Ibsen's
``Doll's House''!
</P>
<P>
   Our bolt of lightning, ``A Doll's Life,'' flashed for a brief
moment, then hit our house. It was about what happened to Nora
after she slammed that door and walked out into the alien world of
1879. Pawing the floor nervously we took the idea to the
incomparable Hal Prince, having recently had a great experience
with him working on ``On the 20th Century.''
</P>
<P>
   Hal jumped over the desk in one leap saying it was the greatest
idea he'd ever heard, and guaranteed us a production he would
direct, which he eventually did and superbly. He put us together
with the composer Larry Grossman who wrote some gorgeous music and
was a joy to work with. It closed after five performances.
</P>
<P>
   So what went wrong? Was it the subject matter? Or did we lack
the ``skill and imagination and artistry'' to melt the snows of
Norway into a hot landmark hit? Or did the Three Norns throw up?
Whatever the case, we still feel the basic elements had validity
and life, and find ourselves in the dead of night rewriting in our
heads the key moments and lyrics that would have made it run as
long as ``The Fantasticks.''
</P>
<P>
   This topic of what is valid subject matter for a musical has at
one time or another troubled even the greatest masters. In 1928,
early in their dazzling careers together, Richard Rodgers and
Lorenz Hart faced just such a thorny problem. It was a show to be
based on a novel called ``The Son of the Grand Eunuch.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers expressed his gnawing doubts about how your average
ticket-buying Joe would relate to the leading character and his
desperate attempts to escape the knife, and what kind of lilting
tunes he could come up with to tell his love story.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Hart and Herb Fields, the book writer, somehow convinced
him that it was a swell idea. They proceeded to write ``Chee
Chee,'' which had at least one beautiful song, ``Moon of My
Delight,'' but which was cut off after only 37 performances. Maybe
the world wasn't ready.
</P>
<P>
   So what about ``Cats,'' you say? or ``Les Miz''? Uh ... just a
minute ... we have to answer the phone.

 &HT;    CLINTON SAYS HE WILL ACCEPT CENSURE
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seeking to stave off impeachment, President Clinton
again apologized Friday for having ``misled'' the nation about the
Monica Lewinsky affair, and for the first time told Congress he is
willing to accept its ``censure and rebuke.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want the American people to know, what I want the
Congress to know is that I am profoundly sorry for all I have done
wrong in words and deeds,'' Clinton said. ``I never should have
misled the country, the Congress, my friends or my family. Quite
simply, I gave in to my shame.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's statement, made in a brief White House Rose Garden
appearance, was perhaps the first time in American history that a
president has so frankly admitted his personal failings.
</P>
<P>
   But it seemed to be too little, too late to sway wavering GOP
House members. House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, said the
statement was ``an insult to their intelligence and the
intelligence of all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stopped short of admitting that he lied under oath about
his relationship with the former White House intern, and some
moderate Republicans have said that without a full public
confession, they would vote for his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, within minutes of Clinton's appearance, two House
Republicans who had been considered possible votes against
impeachment declared that they would instead vote for it. They were
Rep. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia and Rodney Freylinghuysen of New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The hastily arranged statement came even as the House Judiciary
Committee was voting to approve the first article seeking his
removal from office. Aides reportedly urged the president, who
leaves early Saturday on a four-day trip to the Mideast, to speak
out before support for impeachment had a chance to solidify.
</P>
<P>
   In his five-minute speech, delivered in a husky voice, Clinton
said he was willing to accept congressional condemnation. He
acknowledged ``the public consequences of my actions are in the
hands of the American people and their representatives in the
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should they determine that my errors of word and deed require
their rebuke and censure, I am ready to accept that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The president also made it clear that his wife and daughter
continue to suffer through the anguish wrought by his affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Painful though the condemnation of the Congress would be, it
would pale in comparison to the consequences of the pain I have
caused my family,'' he said. ``There is no greater agony.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's speech continued a series of increasingly contrite
apologies stretching over several months.
</P>
<P>
   It came three months to the day after Clinton acknowledged, ``I
have sinned,'' before a White House prayer breakfast attended by
clergy members from across the nation. ``It is important to me that
everybody who has been hurt knows that the sorrow that I feel is
genuine _ first and foremost my family, also my friends, my staff,
my cabinet, Monica Lewinsky and her family and the American
people,'' he said then.
</P>
<P>
   In a nationwide address Aug. 17, Clinton admitted that his
relationship with Lewinsky ``was not appropriate. In fact it was
wrong. It constituted a critical lapse of judgment on my part for
which I am solely and completely responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton still could make an even more forthcoming statement next
week before the House begins debate Thursday on the impeachment
articles approved by the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But despite his repeated apologies, Republican critics charge
that Clinton has never fully admitted the extent of his wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's statement appeared to be another tentative step in
that direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``These past months have been a torturous process of coming to
terms with what I did,'' he said. ``I understand that
accountability demands consequences, and I'm prepared to accept
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he wished he could take it all back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like anyone who honestly faces the shame of wrongful conduct,
I would give anything to go back and undo what I did,'' he said.
``But one of the painful truths I have to live with is the reality
that that is simply not possible.''

CHAMBER'S INCOME FORECAST PUZZLING IN LIGHT OF TIGHT LABOR MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ While the Greater Kansas City Chamber of
Commerce economic forecast is fairly predictable, one conclusion
may not compute.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's presentation by Frank Lenk, director of the
Mid-America Regional Council's research services department,
foresaw the same trend toward slower growth for the regional
economy that most economists predict for the national economy.
</P>
<P>
   The most surprising prediction in the chamber's outlook for the
local economy, however, was its call for a sharp decrease in the
pace of personal income growth. The call was for a rise of only 1.9
percent from this year's fourth quarter to next year's fourth
quarter. If the prediction proves accurate, this would represent a
40 percent plunge from the real personal income increase recorded
in the previous four quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The cognitive dissonance created by this prognostication derives
from a straw poll conducted in conjunction with the chamber's
formal 1999 forecast. This survey of area business owners and
managers showed just over two-thirds of the respondents identifying
``lack of qualified workers'' as their most significant challenge
to growth.
</P>
<P>
   If growing businesses see hiring and keeping qualified workers
as their biggest obstacle, it would seem to follow that the
resulting competition for effective workers would fuel a bidding
war in the local labor market.
</P>
<P>
   This local labor market, incidentally, is already well beyond
what economists now view as full employment. The area jobless rate
has fallen to just over 3 percent, its lowest since the late '70s
and nearly 30 percent below the national rate. Most economists
consider a 5 percent jobless rate as full employment, which means
anyone hereabouts who wants work already has a job.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, slower growth theoretically causes the available wage
pool to grow more slowly, but extraordinary challenges force
extraordinary solutions. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that
employers will be compelled in some cases to rearrange operating
budgets to accommodate higher-than-usual labor costs.
</P>
<P>
   The validity of this assumption is reinforced by the chamber
forecast for area employment growth, which is predicted to occur at
only about half the previous year's pace. Though this substantial
decline in new hires may reflect a weakening economy, it's probably
just as reflective of the fact that there aren't that many warm
bodies left to hire. If so, the most prized workers will see their
premiums soar, which perhaps implies considerably better income
growth than the chamber forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more encouraging aspects of the straw poll was that
the local business community has higher expectations for the area
economy than for the country as a whole. While 22 percent expect
stronger growth for the national economy next year, 28 percent
expect improved growth for the Kansas City economy in 1999.
Moreover, only 11 percent expect a slowing of area economic growth,
but nearly 40 percent expect slower national growth.
</P>
<P>
   On balance, both the business community's attitude and the
chamber's outlook are remarkably upbeat for an economic expansion
that will mark its eighth birthday in March.

MORE MEN ARE RAISING CHILDREN ALONE, CENSUS REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATT CAMPBELL  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OVERLAND PARK, Kan. _ More Americans are doing what Allen
Russell of Overland Park has been doing for several years: raising
a child as a single father.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. census figures being released today show that since 1995,
the number of single fathers raising children has grown 25 percent,
from 1.7 million to 2.1 million. Fathers now make up one-sixth of
all single parents. The number of single mothers raising children
has remained constant at about 9.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The trend reflects accelerating changes in social attitudes
toward unmarried men raising children, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got more fathers who are petitioning for custody at the
time of divorce and more mothers who are sort of realizing it's OK
for them not to be the custodial parent,'' said James Levine,
director of the Fatherhood Project at the Families and Work
Institute in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Russell was surprised to learn he has so much company. The
38-year-old Sprint employee fought _ against his lawyer's advice _
for joint custody of his daughters when his wife asked for a
divorce five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren, now 10, and Heather, now 7, live with their father and
visit their mother. Russell also is applying to adopt two brothers,
Mike, 13, and Dominick, 9, who are his foster sons. He also works
with other kids through Youth Friends and his church.
</P>
<P>
   ``People assume when there's a divorce that mom gets the kids,''
Russell said Thursday. ``People are shocked when they learn. `You
got the kids?' It's the most frustrating part of being a single
dad.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Canfield, president and founder of the National Center for
Fathering, which is in Merriam, Kan., said the trend has evolved
from the early 1960s, when single dads were rare and usually
widowers.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the rise in divorce and changes in custody laws have
led to more fathers assuming primary residential care for their
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more fathers are finding out that they want to do it
and that they can do it,'' agreed John R. Sims Jr., founder of the
Single and Custodial Fathers Network in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau report on household and family characteristics
also suggests social and political discussion about family values
may be slowing the decline of ``family households.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 102.5 million households in the United States, 69 percent
are considered family households _ two or more persons living
together and related by birth, marriage or adoption. That is a 2
percentage-point drop since 1990, compared with a 10
percentage-point drop from 1970-1990.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of one-parent families has slowed. They were 11
percent of family households with children in 1970, 24 percent in
1990 and 27 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A key factor in the leveling off in the number of single mothers
is the drop in teen pregnancies, notes Susan Scribner, director of
the Kids Count project with Citizens for Missouri's Children in St.
Louis. Most pregnant teens are unmarried.
</P>
<P>
   The teen birth rate in Missouri dropped from 63 per 1,000 to 54
per 1,000 between 1992 and 1996. Nationally, teen pregnancy hit a
20-year low in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The census numbers indicate the growth in single fathers raising
children is occurring primarily in white and Hispanic families. The
number of white single fathers raising children grew 36 percent,
and the number of Hispanic fathers doing so increased 18.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The number of black single fathers raising children has declined
15 percent since 1995, said Lynne Casper, a statistician with the
Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   But what does the overall trend mean for the children growing up
in households headed by single dads?
</P>
<P>
   A better financial outlook is one possibility.
</P>
<P>
   The median weekly income for women still is only about
three-quarters that of men. About half of all single-family
households are at or below the poverty line, said Scribner, and
poverty increases other risks for children, such as poor health and
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Scribner said most studies indicate that children are better off
in a two-parent household, but she knew of no studies that
indicated children were better off living with either a single
father or a single mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fathers and mothers bring different things to the parenting
role,'' she said, ``and the child could do exceedingly well with
either one if they are getting the love and support they need.''
</P>
<P>
   Lauren, Mike and Heather seemed content doing their homework
before dinner Thursday evening in the light of a Christmas tree at
the Russell house.
</P>
<P>
   ``My kids are well-behaved, and when people find out they come
from a single-parent family, they say, `Really?' '' Russell said.
``That tells me, yes, I'm doing something right.''

 &HT;    CLINTON SAYS HE WILL ACCEPT CENSURE
 &HT;    Eds: subs Franks for Freylinghuysen in grafs 6 and 7.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seeking to stave off impeachment, President Clinton
again apologized Friday for having ``misled'' the nation about the
Monica Lewinsky affair, and for the first time told Congress he is
willing to accept its ``censure and rebuke.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want the American people to know, what I want the
Congress to know is that I am profoundly sorry for all I have done
wrong in words and deeds,'' Clinton said. ``I never should have
misled the country, the Congress, my friends or my family. Quite
simply, I gave in to my shame.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's statement, made in a brief White House Rose Garden
appearance, was perhaps the first time in American history that a
president has so frankly admitted his personal failings.
</P>
<P>
   But it seemed to be too little, too late to sway wavering GOP
House members. House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, said the
statement was ``an insult to their intelligence and the
intelligence of all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stopped short of admitting that he lied under oath about
his relationship with the former White House intern, and some
moderate Republicans have said that without a full public
confession, they would vote for his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, within minutes of Clinton's appearance, two House
Republicans who had been considered possible votes against
impeachment declared that they would instead vote for it. They were
Rep. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia and Bob Franks of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Franks, saying the House Judiciary Committee ``has laid out a
compelling case that the president has committeed perjury,'' said
that ``unless the president comes forward soon and admits his
guilt, I am prepared to vote for articles of impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's hastily arranged statement came even as the Judiciary
Committee was voting to approve the first article seeking his
removal from office. Aides reportedly urged the president, who
leaves early Saturday on a four-day trip to the Mideast, to speak
out before support for impeachment had a chance to solidify.
</P>
<P>
   In his five-minute speech, delivered in a husky voice, Clinton
said he was willing to accept congressional condemnation. He
acknowledged ``the public consequences of my actions are in the
hands of the American people and their representatives in the
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should they determine that my errors of word and deed require
their rebuke and censure, I am ready to accept that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The president also made it clear that his wife and daughter
continue to suffer through the anguish wrought by his affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Painful though the condemnation of the Congress would be, it
would pale in comparison to the consequences of the pain I have
caused my family,'' he said. ``There is no greater agony.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's speech continued a series of increasingly contrite
apologies stretching over several months.
</P>
<P>
   It came three months to the day after Clinton acknowledged, ``I
have sinned,'' before a White House prayer breakfast attended by
clergy members from across the nation. ``It is important to me that
everybody who has been hurt knows that the sorrow that I feel is
genuine _ first and foremost my family, also my friends, my staff,
my cabinet, Monica Lewinsky and her family and the American
people,'' he said then.
</P>
<P>
   In a nationwide address Aug. 17, Clinton admitted that his
relationship with Lewinsky ``was not appropriate. In fact it was
wrong. It constituted a critical lapse of judgment on my part for
which I am solely and completely responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton still could make an even more forthcoming statement next
week before the House begins debate Thursday on the impeachment
articles approved by the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But despite his repeated apologies, Republican critics charge
that Clinton has never fully admitted the extent of his wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's statement appeared to be another tentative step in
that direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``These past months have been a torturous process of coming to
terms with what I did,'' he said. ``I understand that
accountability demands consequences, and I'm prepared to accept
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he wished he could take it all back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like anyone who honestly faces the shame of wrongful conduct,
I would give anything to go back and undo what I did,'' he said.
``But one of the painful truths I have to live with is the reality
that that is simply not possible.''

COMMENTARY: THE OPRAH GAP
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By FRANK RICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like a yearlong standoff between nagging parents and an
adolescent who won't do his homework, the disconnect between the
media gasbags and the public goes on and on. This week, despite the
insistent talking-head lectures about the ``historic'' import of it
all, the audience for impeachment hearings on CNN dwindled to
one-third the size of that for the Clinton grand-jury testimony. It
may take a graphic video of the president and Monica Lewinsky not
having sex while not being alone in the White House to get the
nation's viewers to tune in now.
</P>
<P>
   The same Washington sermonizers who faulted the American people
all year for being too mesmerized by the Dow Jones to care about
Paula Jones are already finding a new cause for the callow, selfish
public's indifference: Christmas shopping. We're just too busy
playing Santa to pay attention to the patriotic show put on for our
civic edification by the House's Kris Kringle wannabe, Henry Hyde,
and his nattering crew of elves.
</P>
<P>
   But the gap between the media and the public isn't and wasn't
about making money or spending it. There's a deeper rebellion afoot
that transcends and may well outlast the specific politics of the
Clinton wars. In 1998 the public didn't merely reject the
prognostications and moral homilies of the Sams and Cokies; it
turned against the media's sermonizing cultural potentates too. The
disconnect that played out in the polls and the November election
was echoed in the mass culture in which Americans also vote, albeit
with clickers at home and dollars at the multiplex.
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic example was Oprah Winfrey's film ``Beloved.''
In October, according to the tracking of the newsletter NewsTV
Reports, it was the subject of 24 TV news-magazine pieces (second
only to Clinton's 30). Previously this year Oprah was crowned the
most powerful person in show business by Entertainment Weekly and
one of the century's top 20 artists and entertainers (along with
Picasso, Joyce and Stravinsky) by Time. And yet she could not, we
discovered, turn out even a respectably mediocre audience for her
movie _ despite an additional media juggernaut including 11
magazine covers (from Vogue to TV Guide), an overwhelming majority
of favorable reviews (as tabulated by Variety) and a ubiquitous,
costly Disney promotional push.
</P>
<P>
   As with the political disconnect, journalistic post-mortems put
the blame on a frivolous public: we had rejected a long, serious
movie about slavery from a novel by a Nobel laureate. But this same
public was riveted shortly thereafter by the confirmation of
another, real-life slavery drama, that of Thomas Jefferson and
Sally Hemings; it had also taken to the long, often bleak ``Saving
Private Ryan'' in the heat of summer.
</P>
<P>
   The real problem _ and it was true from the day ``Beloved''
opened, before ``word of mouth'' could be the culprit _ was that
the audience feared more sermon than drama from the increasingly
more preachy Oprah. As Tom Shales wrote in The Washington Post,
``Winfrey playing national nanny is getting to be a drag'' _ a
sentence that could also describe TV's Clinton-scandal gasbags.
</P>
<P>
   In a year that has also seen the accelerating collapse of the
broadcast TV networks _ until now the single most constant power in
American cultural life since World War II _ the public is
increasingly ignoring the media establishment. It found ``There's
Something About Mary'' without guidance from cultural authorities;
it boisterously challenged Modern Library's great books list the
moment the luminaries handed it down.
</P>
<P>
   A country that has refused to believe supposed opinion makers
who have been predicting Clinton's imminent demise all year
certainly isn't going to believe them about ``Primary Colors''
(another highly touted flop) or ``Felicity'' (the season's most
heavily hyped new TV series, ranked No. 108 in the Nielsen
ratings).
</P>
<P>
   In this rebellious climate, the newest media juggernaut _
Dreamworks' animated biblical feature, ``The Prince of Egypt,'' now
being hawked by journalists and TV clergymen alike _ is all but
asking for the next national backlash. Should this cartoon fail to
deliver numbers equal to its hype, the public that has revolted
against our media moralists by choosing Clinton over Starr and
Springer over Oprah will end the year on the absolutely perfect
note: voting for animated ants, ``Rugrats'' and ``The Waterboy''
over Moses.

<P>
   ROTHERHAM, England _ On Monday, Jan. 4, Europe's new single
currency, the euro, will be introduced in 11 nations with some 290
million people. But this old steel town, with a population of
250,000 and a tendency to attract unwelcome mockery of its
provincialism, has beaten the rest of Europe to the punch.
</P>
<P>
   While Britain itself has rejected initial participation in the
single currency, the business leaders of Rotherham (pronounced
ROTH-er-um) decided that for a week in mid-November, they would
introduce the ``Rotherham euro'' _ a voucher with a nominal value
of 70 pence ($1.12), roughly what one euro was worth at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Two months before the euro's debut in cross-border transactions
and more than two years before real euro bills and coins will be
available, some 90,000 euro vouchers were given out to the people
of depressed South Yorkshire to let them know what the euro-fuss is
all about. In American terms, its equal would have been, say, a
mock-dollar redeemable in only Akron, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The Rotherham euro was a matter of ``some hype,'' acknowledged
Phil Davies, a marketing consultant involved in the project. But he
added that it ``was hype, with substance'' because, in its modest
way, the experiment drew attention to a debate that is growing more
ferocious in Britain even as it watches the inception of the euro
from the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   It is a debate in which economic issues have long been colored
by a fierce nationalism, driven by conservative newspapers and
politicians. Yet it is also coming to reflect a more basic
philosophic conflict between the freewheeling, market-driven ethos
that Britain models on the United States and the big-government
priorities of a Continent pressed to the left by the recent
elections in France and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Many business leaders argue that Britain cannot afford to delay
joining the euro, saying that it will revolutionize European
markets and that British exports will lose competitiveness if the
country remains outside the euro zone. But others worry that
monetary union would also mean higher taxes and heftier labor costs
in line with the rest of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot operate a single currency for long without a
unified fiscal policy,'' argued Kevin Gardiner, an economist with
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in London. `'So the question has to be
raised: Do the British people want to cede fiscal sovereignty?''
</P>
<P>
   The latest flare-up in the debate over the euro concerns
``harmonization,'' the notion promoted by France and Germany that
the euro will be undermined if some countries within the monetary
union offer tax and labor incentives, drawing investment and money
away from others, in much the same way as states in the United
States compete for businesses.
</P>
<P>
   But such talk is alarming in Britain, which cherishes its status
as a magnet for banks and other companies that find the Continent
too pricey. Compared with the 11 nations _ Austria, Belgium,
Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Portugal and Spain _ that will make up ``Euroland,''
Britain generally has weaker labor unions and lower taxes. Germany,
for example, has a maximum tax rate of over 60 percent, compared
with 40 percent in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   France and Germany deny that they are seeking uniform income-tax
rates across Europe, saying what they want is a withholding-tax on
cross-border savings and an end to tax havens in countries like
Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
   While the British government says it, too, is against unfair tax
regimes, it also does not want to alarm London's financial
district, the prime marketplace for Europe _ euro or no euro.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we want,'' said Gordon Brown, Britain's chancellor of the
exchequer, ``is tax competition, not tax cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   The battle over taxation levels is one of several economic
issues intertwined with the fiercely nationalistic political debate
that has forced the Labor government, like its Conservative
predecessor, to adopt a wait-and-see policy. It says a decision on
joining the euro will not be taken until after a referendum to be
held following the next national election, which must be called at
the latest by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   But, the single currency's promoters maintain, the longer
Britain stays out, the less its influence will be and the more
conditions in Europe will be dictated by others.
</P>
<P>
   (In a way, Britain has already had a taste of that: When the
central banks of the euro nations lowered interest rates on Dec. 3,
the Bank of England was a spectator. On Dec. 10, Britain's central
bank lowered its benchmark rate a half-point, to 6.25 percent _ but
still double the Euroland norm.)

   For critics of the euro, being outside Euroland is a plus, not a
minus. Britain, they say, is at a different point in the economic
cycle and has nothing to gain by exposing its strengths _ cheaper
labor, lower taxation and flexibility _ to any further dictates of
common European policies.
</P>
<P>
   At its most visceral level, the political debate is driven by
such euro-skeptic institutions as Rupert Murdoch's mass-market
newspaper The Sun. A front page of The Sun, for instance, described
Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine of Germany as the most dangerous
man in Europe, and hinted at a vulgar expletive to tell him what to
do with his tax proposals.
</P>
<P>
   So deep is the nationalistic vein that there has already been a
debate about whether Queen Elizabeth's head would appear on the
euro _ as it does on the pound _ even though Britain is not a
member. (Under current plans, an image of her head would be
allowed.)
</P>
<P>
   For many euro advocates, though, Britain has already waited too
long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many people in Britain have spent the last few years
deluding themselves, some hoping that if we all shut our eyes
tightly enough, the single currency would simply go away,'' said
Niall Fitzgerald, the chairman of Unilever, the British-Dutch
consumer products company. ``Others arrogantly assumed that if
Britain didn't like the idea, it just wouldn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 23, 114 business leaders took out a full-page
advertisement in The Financial Times to urge a speedy embrace of
the new currency. An earlier survey cited 63 per cent of business
respondents as saying they favored the euro.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Why? Ask Julie Kenny, managing director of a security company
employing some 200 people in an industrial park on the outskirts of
Rotherham. Mrs. Kenny started the business in 1986 with a start-up
stake equivalent to $32,000 from the sale of a house, with a
further $13,000 in outside capital. These days, its annual sales,
she said, are around $18 million, and her company, Pyronix Ltd., is
seen as a local success story.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, when the European Union introduced its single
market, knocking down nearly all the remaining barriers to trade,
finance and travel within Europe, Pyronix has exported some 40
percent of its output, the bulk of it to the Continent.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, as the pound has strengthened against the
German mark and French franc, Pyronix's Continental customers have
complained about rising prices, while its British market has been
undercut by cheaper imports.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exchange rate has meant tremendous pressure,'' she said.
The cost of a strong pound ``has got to be found in reduced
profits.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other small British exporters, Mrs. Kenny's company has
already set up a euro bank account to deal with clients who want to
pay in euros _ only Siemens, the German electronics giant, has so
far said it will _ and it will put out a euro price list in
January, when the currency comes into use in electronic
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Rotherham's biggest employer, British Steel, is also prepared to
use the euro. `'We are going to allow our customers to decide which
way they want to do business,'' said Colin Jackson, a British Steel
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kenny now believes, with some qualifications, that Britain
should join. ``If it's successful and the Europeans are trading
extensively in euros, then we as businesses have to be on the
inside, playing on the same terms as everyone else, rather than on
the outside looking in,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The 114 signatories of business leaders' advertisement made
similar points. The euro ``will promote low and stable interest
rates and low inflation, and encourage prudent fiscal management,''
they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But even business leaders worry that there may be negative
consequences if Britain joins. For instance, Continental labor laws
make it harder to lay off workers. Personal and corporate taxes are
generally higher. As a proportion of national output, British tax
revenues account for only 40 percent compared with some 50 percent
in continental Europe. If Britain were forced to emulate other
European nations, Mrs. Kenny said, it would mean ``higher prices,
and more companies going bust.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ralph Robins, the chairman of Rolls-Royce PLC, told an
audience in Australia, ``The last thing we want in Britain is some
of the European labor laws appearing in the United Kingdom, and I'm
not just saying that for Rolls-Royce; I'm saying it for every
industrialist in the UK.''
</P>
<P>
   A move in that direction is unlikely, because Britain retains a
veto over having to impose such measures adopted by the 15-nation
European Union. But the anxieties touch the core of Britain's euro
debate, fueling the argument that, by joining, Britain would cede
control over taxes and government spending to policy-makers in
Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   The counter-argument advanced by Brown, chancellor of the
exchequer, is that taxes need not be uniform. ``You have a single
currency in the United States, but they have different income,
corporate and sales taxes right across the U.S.A.,'' he said after
meeting with other European finance ministers in Brussels. ``So
there is no reason why the single currency requires the same tax
rates for businesses to be able to work.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is no denying that joining the euro means giving up
control over interest rates. That leaves individual countries
unable to rely on monetary changes to counter economic ups and
downs when they are out of step with the rest of Europe, as Britain
is today.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be a single euro interest rate set by the
European Central Bank,'' said an economist in London. ``While that
may be appropriate for Europe as a whole, it may not be appropriate
for individual countries.''
</P>
<P>
   In Rotherham, some of the arguments seemed arcane, particularly
for those who are, as Davies, the marketing consultant, put it,
``still getting over decimalization,'' when Britain abandoned
pounds, shillings and pence in favor of decimal currency. That was
in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   John Redwood, a Conservative Party foe of the euro, dismissed
the Rotherham euro as a `'ridiculous stunt.'' Not so, Davies
replied. The point was to show that obscure places like Rotherham
are ready to deal with euros when necessary. ``The issue of whether
we join or not,'' he said, ``is for another day.''

VIDEO GAMES HOT AS GIFTS, BRING HEAT TO CRITICS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reports of scuffling in the toy aisles have yet to surface, but
two new Nintendo video games _ Pokemon and the Legend of Zelda _
may be almost as hot as Furby, this year's holiday hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're selling out as fast as we get shipments,'' said Best Buy
spokeswoman Laurie Bauer of Pokemon. ``In some cases, we've had to
give out rainchecks.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, BuySafe.com, a Cambridge, Mass. Internet retailer,
issued a statement Friday assuring all hands that it has ``ample
inventory'' of Legend of Zelda games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been shipping out a couple of hundred a day,'' said
BuySafe spokesman Dan Johnson of Zelda.
</P>
<P>
   Zelda is also popular at the Burlington (Mass.) Mall, where the
house Santa has been bombarded with requests for Nintendo 64 games.
</P>
<P>
   At the mall's Electronics Boutique, ``Zelda 64 is all sold
out,'' said mall spokeswoman Sheila Hennessy.
</P>
<P>
   Pokemon, which supposedly means ``pocket monsters'' in Japanese,
sells for about $30 and is played on the hand-held Game Boy system,
the new color version of which sells for $79.
</P>
<P>
   Zelda has a suggested price of $60, and it is played on the
Nintendo 64 game console, which lists for about $129.
</P>
<P>
   With a $14 million marketing campaign behind it _ and the KFC
fast-food chain ponying up millions more for its own pocket-monster
promotion _ Pokemon could rack up sales on par with such past Game
Boy hits as Super Mario and Donkey Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the cartoon TV show that has made Pokemon a
phenomenon in Japan for the last few years. With its pulsing bright
lights, the series was blamed for making hundreds of children sick
before the special effects were toned down.
</P>
<P>
   Children's television activist Peggy Charren is nauseated about
Pokemon for a different reason: By her lights, the cartoon is
basically a 30-minute commercial for Pokemon products.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wonder which came first, the show or the merchandise?''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Given all this hype and hoo-ha, Nintendo expects US sales of 1
million Pokemon games between its fall launch and Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Zelda64 could do even better, selling 2.5 million units between
late November and Dec. 31, Nintendo of America predicts.
</P>
<P>
   Just by way of comparison, Tiger Toys, the Hasbro Inc. division
that markets Furby, is expected to sell between 1 million and 2
million of the jabbering $30 furballs.
</P>
<P>
   In Pokemon, players vie for a black belt in pocket-monster
house-breaking. Simply put, the goal of the game is to locate and
tame the 150 monsters that run rampant through the game
environment. Players must train and nurture one monster to help
capture other monsters and turn them into virtual pets.
</P>
<P>
   From Yarmouth to Yokahoma, there are few more coveted glories
for a 10-year-old boy than being recognized by his pals as a pukka
Pokemon tamer. And in case a kid can't get enough of his Game Boy,
there are also Pokemon comics, videos, and plush toys.
</P>
<P>
   Zelda has the potential to be even bigger. While Pokemon
``skews'' toward boys between 8 and 14, Zelda appeals to a much
broader age range, said Beth Llewelyn, a Nintendo spokesperson.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers placed orders for 500,000 Zelda games before it even
shipped, triple the number of early orders for any previous video
game, Nintendo claims.
</P>
<P>
   According to Nintendo, Zelda is so intricately layered that
playing the game is like reading a novel, as players journey to a
magic kingdom dense with role-playing plot lines, 3-D graphics, and
an ocarina sound-track. One hype-crazed reviewer was moved to call
Zelda ``The `Gone With the Wind' of video games.''
</P>
<P>
   Because demand exceeds supply, Furby may be the season's
scarcest toy. But in terms of unit and dollar sales, Zelda could
eclipse Furby, and Pokemon could come close to Furby, too.
</P>
<P>
   Pokemon and Zelda may be selling better at specialty software
retailers than traditional toy stores.
</P>
<P>
   At KB Toys, spokesman John Reilly said Pokemon hasn't reached
the level of a phenomenon a la Furby.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``That's not to say Pokemon isn't hot.''
</P>
<P>
   At Toys ``R'' Us, spokeswoman Rebecca A. Caruso offered a
similar appraisal of Pokemon: ``It's a big seller. It's the newest
thing in virtual pets.''

LAST BAY STATE COMPUTER MAKER NEAR INSOLVENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY ACKERMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Massachusetts' last computer manufacturing company, Nexar
Technologies Inc. of Southborough, is preparing to declare
insolvency after failing to raise capital to pay off creditors and
preferred shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Nexar said it expected its stock to be delisted by Nasdaq for
failure to meet minimum financial requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Shares Friday were trading at 1/16, where they have been since
November, when an announcement of possible bankruptcy set off a
flurry of trading. Nexar hasn't traded above 1 since July; it
closed Friday at 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Conrad, a Nexar spokesman, said he did not know whether
the company would seek protection from creditors under Chapter 11
of the bankruptcy law, or file for a Chapter 7 liquidation.
</P>
<P>
   Nexar reported in November that it was facing $5.5 million in
lawsuits by creditors and a $3.3 million claim by holders of
preferred shares who want to redeem those holdings. Conrad said
Nexar doesn't have the money.
</P>
<P>
   The company closed its Hayward, Calif., factory in November and
has reduced its payroll to 23 employees from 80 in June.
</P>
<P>
   Several attempts to find a buyer earlier this year failed,
Conrad said.
</P>
<P>
   Nexar's modular design for personal computers, with features
that let owners buy and install upgrade parts in minutes, was
widely hailed when it was introduced in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But apart from a contract to supply some federal agencies, sales
never took off and plunged this year as the company's future became
uncertain and prices for competitive personal computers fell below
$1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Nexar reported $33.6 million in sales in 1997, losing $13.6
million for the year. Revenues for the first nine months of this
year were just under $10 million, with losses for the period,
including preferred stock dividends, posted at $14.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Originally capitalized with $12 million from Palomar Medical
Technologies Inc. of Beverly, Mass., Nexar raised $19.7 million in
April 1997 through an initial public stock offering. Most of that
went to repay Palomar, Conrad said. Palomar continues to be Nexar's
largest shareholder and dominates the company's board.

PINOCHET DEFIANT AT LONDON COURT HEARING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Twenty-five years after he led a bloody coup in Chile,
former dictator Augusto Pinochet appeared Friday in a court of law
_ an appointment with justice decried by his supporters as
outrageous but cheered by those he brutalized as long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a wheelchair, Pinochet 83, was defiant during a
brief, initial hearing on his extradition from England to Spain,
where authorities want to try him for murder and torture committed
during and after the 1973 coup.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Spanish, Pinochet read from an index card, telling
Magistrate Graham Parkinson, ``With respect to your honor, I don't
recognize the jurisdiction of any other court but in my country to
try me against all the lies of Spain.''
</P>
<P>
   With a dismissive wave of his hand, Pinochet concluded, ``That
is all I want to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Parkinson continued the case until Jan. 18, adding that Pinochet
does not have to attend that hearing. Parkinson said Pinochet can
remain at the mansion he is renting 20 miles southwest of London
during the extradition proceedings, which could last for months. He
said too that Pinochet could use the grounds of the mansion, as
long as he did so under armed guard.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's lawyers plan an all-out offensive to have the
extradition charges dropped. Pinochet's enfeebled appearance
clutching a walking stick and asking to be excused from standing
while the charges were read struck some legal observers as the
beginning of a campaign to gain his release for health reasons. Yet
last week, he was told to leave the London hospital where he had
undergone back surgery because doctors there said he did not
require further care.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, British Home Secretary Jack Straw cleared the way
for the extradition proceedings to begin by saying that the former
dictator is not entitled to any form of immunity and does not
deserve to avoid prosecution on compassionate grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Straw upheld the Nov. 25 decision by five Law Lords in the House
of Lords who ruled 3-2 that Pinochet could not claim sovereign
immunity for human rights violations committed while he ruled Chile
between 1973 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Chilean government report, at least 3,197 people
were killed or disappeared during Pinochet's tenure. Human rights
organizations maintain that the figure is much higher.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, lawyers for Pinochet will begin a rare appeal of the
Law Lords' decision on the grounds that one of the three judges who
voted against Pinochet, Lord Leonard Hoffmann, serves on the board
of an Amnesty International charity. Lawyers for Amnesty
International were among those who argued in the House of Lords
that the lower court ruling that Pinochet could not be extradited
was legally flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International says that attempts to paint Lord Hoffmann
as biased are specious and that the charity on which he serves as
an unpaid director was also supported by the chief justice of the
High Court, whose decision to grant immunity to Pinochet was
overturned by the Law Lords.
</P>
<P>
   Held back by security cordons and separated by police at the
Belmarsh Magistrate's Court, Pinochet's supporters and detractors
Friday assembled on opposite sides of the road leading into the
court complex and traded insults. Supporters waved Chilean flags
while his enemies danced and sang songs recalling the 1,000
``disappeared'' who were abducted by Pinochet's security forces and
are presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Pinochet is convicted in Spain, he will not be sent to
prison there because under Spanish law no one over the age of 75
can be incarcerated. But he could spend years defending himself
against other countries that have formally lodged warrants for his
arrest. France and Switzerland have asked that he be extradited to
face charges for the murder of their nationals, and Italy is
considering making a similar request.

   Gingrich Gets A New Platform &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich grabbed headlines back in 1995 for complaining
about his seat on the Air Force One flight to Israel for Yitzhak
Rabin's funeral. Soon, the outgoing House Speaker will have another
forum for opining about flying in style.
</P>
<P>
   Forstmann Little &AMP; Co., a private investment firm whose holdings
include Gulfstream Aerospace, said this week that Gingrich would be
joining its advisory board.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich will be in familiar company. Theodore J. Forstmann, a
general partner, is fond of inviting brand-name Washingtonians onto
the boards. Gulfstream, which is publicly traded, counts Colin L.
Powell, Henry A. Kissinger and George P. Shultz as directors. They
also are on Forstmann Little's advisory board.
</P>
<P>
   It's a strategy that allows Forstmann and Gulfstream to fly with
a tail wind. These directors are on the phone all day with people
who might need a $35 million Gulfstream jet. It has certainly been
lucrative for the directors, many of whom pocketed profits of
around $1 million this year from stock options.
</P>
<P>
   Such sums may tempt Gingrich to lobby for a seat on Gulfstream's
board. Chances are that he will nab a seat more to his liking than
the one he had on Air Force One.

   For Mark Cuban, president of Broadcast.com, a soaring initial
public offering on NASDAQ in July was more than just an opportunity
to market his shares. He turned it into a chance to market his
services _ namely, the broadcasting of audio and video on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, NASDAQ said that beginning early next year,
Broadcast.com would carry the quarterly earnings conferences that
the 100 largest NASDAQ companies conduct for analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban says individual investors will have the same access as
Wall Street insiders to information that often moves stocks. ``A
conference call usually maxes out at four or five hundred,'' he
said. ``Yet for us to have four, five, six thousand users on line,
listening in, is no big deal.''

   Robert Swanson, a co-founder of Genentech, was the impetus
behind the biotechnology revolution and by virtue of that role is
the most important business leader alive today. So, at least, says
a new book, ``1,000 Years, 1,000 People'' (Kodansha International
Press), which ranks the movers and shakers of the millennium. (This
writer is the co-author, with Barbara Bowers, and Henry Gottlieb
and Agnes Hooper Gottlieb.)
</P>
<P>
   Other business and economics leaders who made the list include
Karl Marx, No. 14; Adam Smith, No. 21, and Henry Ford, No. 51. As
the founder of modern communism, which came to rule half the world,
Marx had even greater influence than Smith, though Smith's
doctrines are now ascendant while Marx's are fading.
</P>
<P>
   Among the living are Swanson (No. 612); Robert N. Noyce, creator
of the first silicon chip (No. 730); Milton Friedman, the
inflation-fighting monetarist (No. 731), and the financier Warren
E. Buffett, ``the embodiment of the human itch to get rich'' (No.
889).
</P>
<P>
   Such rankings, admittedly, are idiosyncratic. Time magazine's
list of the greatest business titans of the 20th century, published
earlier this month, included Ford, but none of the book's living
legends. Time made room for Bill Gates; the compilers of the
millennial list left Gates off, judging him more a mogul than an
innovator.

   To Mary Theresa Weil, the executive-floor receptionist at T.
Rowe Price, the mutual fund company, the hardened leaders of
corporate America are boys at heart. They prove it by shyly asking
to play with the ball of rubber bands on her desk.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is because the sphere, made of 26,000 rubber bands, is
nearing the size of a soccer ball, but visitors just can't seem to
resist. That includes Alexander Trotman, Ford Motor's chief, who
bounced it off the marble tiles when visiting to push Ford stock,
Ms. Weil said.
</P>
<P>
   She gets the raw material from the mail she opens for 14 T. Rowe
Price executives, including George Roche, the chairman, and James
Kennedy, director of the equity and research departments.
</P>
<P>
   The buttoned-down Roche, Ms. Weil said, has never even looked at
the ball, but she once caught the more sportive Kennedy eyeing it.
``I have a lot of daily lookers,'' she said. ``They want to bounce
it, but they don't in front of me. I wonder what happens when I go
home.''

   WASHINGTON _ A basic legal principle lay at the center of the
House Judiciary Committee's debate Friday about the articles of
impeachment against President Clinton: Every defendant has a right
to know the charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   But legal scholars fell into the same disagreement as the
committee members over whether lawmakers were legally obliged to
spell out precisely the charges against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Democrats on the House panel, some scholars said any
charge of perjury should include the exact words that the president
used that are alleged to be untrue. And like the Republicans, some
said that the committee could approve general charges of perjury,
referring the president for details to lengthy reports on the
matter written by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and by the
committee's chief Republican counsel, David Schippers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a 350-page referral by the independent counsel and a
three hour presentation by David Schippers, in which they go
through the elements of each one of the charges,'' said Stephen
Presser, professor of legal history at the Northwestern University
School of Law. ``It's mind-bogglingly astonishing to think that
there's a specificity problem here.''
</P>
<P>
   But Susan Low Bloch, a professor at the Georgetown University
School of Law, said those documents were too broad and general to
constitute a fair notice to President Clinton of the exact nature
of his perjury. ``Before he faces trial, he has to know what he's
alleged to have said, which of his statements are perjurious,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This seems to be a little bit of shadow-boxing,'' said John O.
McGinnis of the Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University in New
York. ``I don't think anyone is in deep doubt about the issues that
president is being charged with.''
</P>
<P>
   Perjury is the basis for first two of the four charges against
the president before the committee. Both perjury articles passed
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In most criminal prosecutions for perjury, prosecutors would
seek an indictment that included fairly specific details of the
alleged lying. For example, Starr's indictment of Webster Hubbell
on perjury and other charges last month includes the exact
questions put to Hubbell by a congressional committee, as well as
Hubbell's allegedly false answer.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's indictment even underlines the 10 words in Hubbell's
answer that prosecutors say constituted perjury.
</P>
<P>
   But legal scholars said there was no analogy between a criminal
case and impeachment, which is a political act as well as legal
process. The lawmakers themselves have the power to decide what
goes into the articles of impeachment. No judge or appeals court
will review their decision, as long as they do not violate the
broad guidelines set out in the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Washington lawyer Charles Cooper said that Clinton, unlike a
traditional criminal defendant, would draw his understanding of the
charges against him from more than the indictment. In addition to
the Starr and Schippers reports, the impeachment process has
already produced hours of debate in which lawmakers and their
staffs state the case against the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not like a defendant who knows what is being alleged
against him,'' said Cooper, of the firm Cooper, Carvin &AMP; Rosenthal,
who handled constitutional cases for the government as an assistant
attorney general. ``Everyone on earth has notice of what the
charges are here.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous articles of impeachment have charged presidents with
making false statements, but they varied in the amount of detail
they included.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee charged President Nixon with
``making false or misleading public statements'' regarding the 1972
break-in at Democratic Party offices at the Watergate complex. The
impeachment articles charged that Nixon misled the public by saying
the administration had investigated the break-in and had cleared
members of Nixon's staff and of his re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But the articles did not lay out the exact misleading statements
that Nixon made.
</P>
<P>
   The 1868 articles of impeachment against President Andrew
Johnson contained great detail about his allegedly misleading
statements. One article charged that Johnson on Feb. 22, 1868 tried
to induce William H. Emory, a major-general in the Army, to violate
a law recently passed by Congress by telling him that the law was
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Another article claimed that Johnson tried ``to excite odium and
resentment of all the good people of the United States against
Congress'' by making ``certain intemperate, inflammatory and
scandalous harangues . . . and bitter menaces.'' Not only were the
dates and locations of the statements listed, but so were excerpts
of Johnson's speeches.

   WASHINGTON _ To one set of lawmakers, the allegation against
President Clinton detailed in the first article of impeachment was
a model of coherence and sufficiently precise detail. To the other,
it was an untenably vague word jumble.
</P>
<P>
   To one group, the allegation perfectly qualified as an
impeachable offense under the high standard set by the
Constitution. To the other, it fell absurdly short.
</P>
<P>
   As Republicans and Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee
bickered furiously Friday, studying the same facts and phrases to
draw opposite conclusions, they often seemed not merely to be
worlds apart, but to be occupying alternate universes.
</P>
<P>
   If a cow had lumbered into the hearing room, members of one
party might have called it a horse; members of the other, a pig.
</P>
<P>
   But on one somber point, there was consensus. Both Republicans
and Democrats agreed, in grave voices and freighted words, that the
decisions before them were as important as any they would ever
make, and that history would sit in judgment of what they did.
</P>
<P>
   ``This vote says something about us,'' said Rep. Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., the 74-year-old chairman of the committee. ``We vote for
our honor, which is the only thing we get to take with us to the
grave.''
</P>
<P>
   The hearing Friday presented something of a paradox, colored as
it was by both an acknowledgment of the momentousness of the
occasion and by intense acrimony between Republicans and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   While members of both political parties summoned the memories of
famous leaders from George Washington and Daniel Webster to Winston
Churchill and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., they drew starkly
different inspiration from these ghosts.
</P>
<P>
   While members of both political parties said they were listening
not to opinion polls or party leaders but to their own hearts,
every Republican heard one set of instructions; every Democrat,
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is a vote of conscience, and I believe it is, it is
going to come down to a Republican conscience versus a Democratic
conscience,'' observed Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. ``And I don't
know how to characterize that. I don't know what that means.''
</P>
<P>
   `` I would suggest that one is not better than the other,''
Graham said. ``I would suggest that there is a very unique nature
about this case that we need to look at long after this case is
over. And only time will tell who got it right.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the four-hour debate over the first article of
impeachment, charging President Clinton with lying under oath about
his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, that triggered the most
heated crossfire.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., complained that he was being
muzzled; Rep. Chris Cannon, R-Utah, shot back that Schumer tended
to go on ``ad nauseum.''
</P>
<P>
   The central disagreement was a somewhat technical one over
whether the first article should spell out each statement by
President Clinton that Republicans say they believe constituted
perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said the absence of such a list
exposed the impeachment process ``for the farce it is.'' Rep. Bob
Barr, R-Ga., called that line of complaint ``very clever, but very
disingenuous.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sometimes corporate earnings matter to investors, and
sometimes they don't. Last week they mattered again.
</P>
<P>
   These shifting sands make investing in the stock market mighty
exasperating today. Since the market came back to life in October,
investors have felt safe buying stocks, regardless of the earnings
outlook. Their focus was on the positive effect that three Federal
Reserve interest rate cuts would have on stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   But with further Fed easing unlikely before February, all eyes
are on earnings. Last week, fears about lower corporate profits
knocked down shares in Coca-Cola, the Ciena Corp. and
Ralston-Purina. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 2.1 percent
on the week.
</P>
<P>
   Not much has changed in the earnings picture. Sure,
fourth-quarter profit warnings have begun. But investors seem to
think that the glass they see is half-empty, not half-full.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that may be confusing investors is the extreme
difference in opinion between investment strategists and industry
analysts about what 1999 holds for profits. According to First
Call, Wall Street market strategists think earnings at Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 companies will rise an average of 4.2 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
   But when First Call compiles estimates of individual industry
analysts, the earnings-growth forecast jumps to 18.7 percent.
Although the gulf between the two groups is often large, it has not
yawned this wide since First Call began tracking the data five
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, investors could shrug off the bad news on profits, as
they have done before. But there are several reasons that earnings
may continue to nag at investors' psyches.
</P>
<P>
   One is that a glut in almost everything _ from commodities like
oil to finished goods like computers _ means that companies cannot
raise their prices. Though a plunge in commodity prices provides an
initial benefit to some companies by lowering their costs, it also
makes it difficult to raise prices on finished products. So profits
will be under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Hyman, a founder of International Strategy and Investment in
New York, has identified a relationship between commodity prices
and corporate earnings that may presage a big decline in 1999
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Tracking year-over-year changes in both the S&AMP;P 500's operating
earnings and the Commodity Research Bureau's commodity index, Hyman
found that the moves had a 64 percent correlation. With the
commodity index down 17.5 percent this year, corporate earnings
could be vulnerable next year.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible threat to earnings lies in consumer spending.
Although consumer confidence has rebounded from its nose dive
earlier this fall, it has started to slip again. The University of
Michigan consumer sentiment index dropped from 102.7 in November to
a preliminary 100.7 this month.
</P>
<P>
   And while retail sales have been strong this holiday season,
Jason Trennert, vice president at ISI reports that retailers say
their pricing power is extremely weak _ 4.2 on a scale of 0 to 100.
Even when business is good, profits are tougher and tougher to come
by. &QL;

WARM WEATHER MELTS WINTER BUYING HABITS AND SALES FORECASTS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: N.D., Minn., N.Y., N.H., Ind.) (bl) 
By SHARON R. KING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At Scheels Ace Hardware in Fargo, N.D., they cannot even give
the snow blowers away.
</P>
<P>
   Even though temperatures have dropped into the 30s from the
mid-40s a week ago, people ``just walk right by'' the bright red
machines, said Tom Molm, an assistant manager. ``Typically there'd
be two, three, four people every day looking and buying. This
weekend, there was one person looking at a used one.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't even ask about ice melt, car survival kits or sleds.
</P>
<P>
   For retailers around the country, especially in the Midwest and
Northeast, balmy temperatures in recent weeks _ often 20 to 30
degrees above normal _ have dampened buying interest in a host of
winter items. Tires, down-filled jackets, ice-fishing gear, skis,
snowboards, sweaters, and gloves, as well as full-length coats _
all are frozen to the shelves.
</P>
<P>
   The summer-like breezes spawned more sunbathing than window
shopping, tightening the screws on department stores and other
chains, which count on robust holiday sales to turn a profit for
the year. Some industry consultants and stock analysts, as a
result, have lowered their sales forecasts for the holiday season
as huge markdowns on items such as coats have done little to spur
spending.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with temperatures falling, retailers are hoping the gusts
of cold air _ not to mention the approach of Christmas _ will send
shoppers scrambling to pick up neglected winter items and
resuscitate holiday sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who wants to buy woolen sweaters and scarves and ski parkas
when temperatures are 70 degrees and there's no snow?'' said Kurt
Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report, a forecasting
company in Upper Montclair, N.J. ``It's not on your mind,'' said
Barnard, who has lowered his sales forecast for the season to a
gain of about 3 to 4 percent, down from 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Sales at specialty stores in shopping malls fell eight-tenths of
1 percent in the week ended Dec. 6 from the corresponding week last
year, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers, a
trade group. The steepest declines were seen in apparel sales, down
4.1 percent. Home furnishings, meanwhile, rose a strong 5.3
percent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The junior women's coat department at the midtown Manhattan
flagship store of Macy's, a unit of Federated Department Stores,
was a sea of coats recently, with many sales racks dotted with
discount tags in hopes of enticing buyers. A few women lingered in
the department, trying on short coats and jackets or all-weather
trench coats, showing little interest in the longer coats across
the aisle.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of other winter items, like sweaters and flannel pajamas,
have also been sluggish, said Carol Sanger, a Federated
spokeswoman. The downturn contributed to a 1.5 percent decline in
November sales at Federated, which also owns Bloomingdale's.
</P>
<P>
   At the Ritz Furs shop in Manhattan, cashmere capes with fur
trim, shorter coats and lighter-weight items are popular, said
Keith Tauber, the manager.
</P>
<P>
   In Dallas, Neiman Marcus is seeing similar interest in its short
coats, and ``anything with a piece of fur on it is selling,'' said
Ralph Romberg, a vice president and divisional manager. Shunning
heavier wools, customers are scooping up cashmere coats and leather
jackets as well as mink- and fox-trimmed capes and fur stoles. Fur
coats that are selling include short, close-fitting, high-priced
designer fashions.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere at Neiman Marcus stores, cashmere sweaters and other
lighter-weight knits and scarves, especially those of cashmere and
silk blends, have sold well. Fashion boots have also eclipsed
heavier utilitarian styles. Neiman Marcus is a unit of Harcourt
General.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the slip in sales, ``we're very optimistic about the
rest of the month,'' Romberg said. While the store is planning to
cut prices on many winter items in hopes of clearing store shelves
before Christmas, margins should not be hurt much, said Hubert
Mullins, an executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of buying clothing this year, many shoppers are
concentrating on their homes, buying furniture, lamps and dishes,
or adding splashes of color with pillows, and new shower curtains.
</P>
<P>
   They have also been spending more time sprucing up home
exteriors, said Cliff Hambleton, district manager for Lowe's in
Fort Wayne, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   People are putting on roofs, replacing windows and doors,
remodeling bathrooms, projects not typically tackled in winter.
</P>
<P>
   One item that has not been hurt by the warm weather: sport
utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   In November, sales of sport utility vehicles increased about 8
percent, to 236,297, according to Ward's Autoinfobank, a
publication of Ward Communications, a research firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty much as soon as the dealers get them, they sell them,''
said Nancy Hubbell, a spokeswoman for Lexus, the Toyota Motor
division that makes two sport vehicles. Lexus dealers have seen
more people milling around showrooms, she said, adding that
``sometimes when the weather turns bad, that's when SUV sales go
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Tires, however, are not selling. Business has slowed from last
year at the Firestone Tire &AMP; Auto store in St. Paul. Minn. ``We do
not sell too many tires when it's not snowing,'' said Dale
Wohnoutka, a store manager. Colder temperatures would also mean
that more cars break down and repair business increases, he added.
Firestone is a unit of Bridgestone.
</P>
<P>
   While it may not have felt like Christmas in recent weeks, it
certainly looks like it now, as customers have splurged on outdoor
decorations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Christmas trim has gone like crazy,'' Hambleton and other
retailers said. Strings of exterior light sets, colored floodlights
and plastic Santas, snowmen and Winnie the Pooh's have disappeared
from store shelves, along with extension cords, plugs and socket
adapters.
</P>
<P>
   But don't try to interest anyone in the space heaters, shovels,
snow scrapers or weather stripping. ``It's a little difficult to
get them to spend their Christmas dollars on that,'' Hambleton
said.
</P>
<P>
   And at sporting goods stores, while rollerblades are hot, few
customers are clamoring for skis, said Ellen Waite, president of
Waite Sports Specialist, a 67-year-old store in Concord, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some people who know the snow is going to be coming
and they prepare in advance,'' she said. ``But most people have
been waiting. They make do with what they have.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Waite is optimistic about the rest of the season,
feeling confident that the cold weather will come and lift sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah, I really think so,'' she said. ``You know what they
say: `You come from New Hampshire. You wait a day. It will get
cold.'''

`MR. FOX' OUTFOXED BY DETAILS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; If cats can be stars of a Broadway show, don't
foxes at least deserve their own opera?
</P>
<P>
   Judging by L.A. Opera's ``Fantastic Mr. Fox,'' which opened
Wednesday night at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, foxes certainly
can carry a tune every bit as well as their feline counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Tobias Picker is likely to become the next Andrew Lloyd
Webber. Justly celebrated for his 1996 operatic debut,
``Emmeline,'' a bleakly lyrical gender-reversed updating of the
Oedipus legend, Picker has emerged as one of American opera's most
promising young composers.
</P>
<P>
   Now he turns his considerable talents to a 30-year-old fable by
Roald Dahl, the freakishly original Welsh author of fiction for
children and adults. The top-flight production team's other members
are librettist Donald Sturrock, a British writer, director and
documentary maker, and Gerald Scarfe, the trenchant British
political cartoonist, who designed the multitiered, asymmetrical
sets and whimsical, anthropomorphic costumes.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, however, these distinct sensibilities haven't quite
meshed to form the cohesive, for-all-ages entertainment that L.A.
Opera honorably intended for its first-ever world premiere
commission.
</P>
<P>
   Written during a time of personal hardship for Dahl, ``Fantastic
Mr. Fox'' is, on one level, the story of a father's resourcefulness
in protecting his family from three vicious farmers bent on
exterminating them: Boggis, Bunce and Bean, ``one fat, one short,
one lean,'' as the libretto puts it.
</P>
<P>
   At the Dorothy Chandler, the trio is played and sung to a fare
thee well by basso Louis Lebherz as Boggis, looking like a fat
killer clownl tenor Doug Jones as the pear-shaped, pretentious
Francophile Bunce; and bass-baritone Jamie Offenbach as the
baleful, goose-stepping Bean.
</P>
<P>
   Amusingly aided in their murderous pursuit by a sadsack tractor
named Mavis (soprano Lesley Leighton) and a dinosaurlike digging
machine named Agnes (mezzo-soprano Jill Grove), the farmers are an
entertaining trio.
</P>
<P>
   So entertaining, in fact, that they make the noble Mr. Fox
(baritone Gerald Finley), his steadfast wife (mezzo-soprano Suzanna
Guzman) and his vulpine brood of four seem slightly dull by
comparison. Though Finley has a sleek, commanding voice and an
elegant presence that suggests the hyper-alertness of a nocturnal
predator, his character isn't fully developed or on stage long
enough to really engage our emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem lies with Sturrocks' libretto. Though it
stays remarkably faithful to Dahl's cranky wit, it pares away much
of the story's urgency so we never truly feel the animals' peril.
</P>
<P>
   Puckish humor rather than narrative propulsiveness also
characterizes Picker's score, spiritedly conducted by Peter Ash.
There's a pleasant, pastoral air to this music, with its sing-songy
snatches of nursery rhyme, or bleating horns and warbling violins
to suggest the woodland creatures. When Agnes the Digger goes to
work, the mood is violently, sensationally interrupted by brutal
brass and kettledrums.
</P>
<P>
   Klezmerish notes pop up when the dowdy Rita the Rat
(mezzo-soprano Josepha Gayer) makes a late entrance, sounding like
a character from some zoological version of ``Three Penny Opera.''
But Picker's melodies are mostly ethereal and suggestive, subtle
hues in a story that seems to call for bold, primary colors.
</P>
<P>
   Those colors are definitely to be found in Scarfe's designs, his
tippy tin-roofed chicken shacks filled with zany, googly-eyed
roosters. Families in search of a G-rated holiday treat could do
far worse than park their offspring in the Chandler's balcony this
month. But with this much talent around, that partial
recommendation feels like a minor letdown.

ORGAN SHORTAGE LEADS TO DUAL LIVE LIVER TRANSPLANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Faced with a chronic shortage of donor organs, a
husband from Vermont and a sister from Massachusetts chose to give
pieces of their own livers to their desperately ill loved-ones in
dramatic, pioneering operations over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In a first for New England, surgeons at Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center removed large portions of the healthy donors' livers
and transplanted them successfully into their wife and brother,
respectively, to save them from terminal liver disease, officials
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A hospital spokeswoman said late Friday that three of the
patients were in stable condition and the fourth _ the Boston
recipient _ had required longer surgery but was on his way to the
recovery room.
</P>
<P>
   None of the patients was identified.
</P>
<P>
   The operations, each lasting at least eight hours and requiring
four surgeons and two operating rooms, took place Thursday and
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Because the liver alone among human organs can regenerate, the
two pieces of one original liver will support both donor and
recipient.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fun thing is that the donor and recipient (livers) sort of
race toward regeneration'' and grow to almost their normal size in
a matter of weeks, said Dr. Roger L. Jenkins, chief of the division
of transplantation at BIDMC.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is fantastic news, because there's a severe shortage, and
this means that more lives will be saved,'' commented Alan
Brownstein, president of the American Liver Foundation in a
telephone interview, when informed of the Boston successes.
</P>
<P>
   He said 4,000 liver transplants are performed annually but there
are 11,000 patients waiting for livers, and 1,000 die while on the
wwaiting list. And, he said, the need for liver transplants is
expected to triple in the next 10 or 20 years because of the
epidemic of liver-destroying hepatitis C. Both of the Beth Israel
Deaconess patients were hepatitis C victims.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins said that transplant surgeon Dr. Elizabeth Pomfret at
BIDMC led the development of the new procedure over the past year.
Pomfret had spent time in Germany observing the work of Dr.
Christoph Broelsch, who performed the first successful living-donor
liver transplant. Broelsch was on hand for the initial Boston
transplants and was ``extremely helpful,'' said Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the transplant team were Dr. David Lewis, director of
liver transplantation at BIDMC, and two transplant fellows, Drs.
James Pomposelli and Douglas Hale.
</P>
<P>
   The adult living transplants are desperate measures being taken
at a time when the need for donor livers is rising and the supply
of livers from brain-dead donors hasn't grown. The chances of
finding a compatible donor within a family or close friends is
excellent because the only genetic matching required of donor and
recipient is that they have the same blood type.
</P>
<P>
   Instances of parents donating a small piece of liver to a child
have become relatively common. But only a handful of the riskier
adult-to-adult transplants, involving the entire right lobe of the
liver, have been done in the United States: between 50 and 100 are
thought to have been performed in the world. It's a more difficult
procedure because as much as 60 percent of the donor's liver has to
be removed, in painstaking surgery to prevent severe bleeding, to
provide enough organ for the recipient.
</P>
<P>
   However, a number of adult-to-adult transplants have been done
this year in Denver, at the Medical College of Virginia and the
Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins said that each of the operations here began with about
three hours of surgery to divide the donor's liver and tie off
blood vessels. Then surgery in an adjacent operating room began to
remove the diseased liver of the recipient. After the donor liver
was removed, it was flushed in preservative solutions and then
implanted into the sick patient.
</P>
<P>
   Done this way, the liver is outside the donor's or recipient's
body for only a short time, which leaves it in better condition
than cadaver livers which may take many hours to transport before
being implanted.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins said both donors in the new transplants had come forward
of their own accord. ``If it's a positive approach on their side,
it makes us more comfortable,'' he said, adding that the two donors
``are two of the most incredible people I've ever met...they are
real heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday surgeons at the Medical College of Virginia in Richmond,
Va., performed their 11th adult-to-adult liver transplant, said Dr.
Marc Posner, head of the division of transplant surgery there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our experience has been remarkably good, better than we
expected,'' said Posner. He said there have been no serious
complications in the recovery of the donors, all of whom have left
the hospital in six to 10 days. ``And they have felt very good
about it psychologically,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Liver transplants ordinarily cost about $500,000 for the surgery
and the first year of post-surgery treatment. Jenkins said the new
approach may actually be cheaper because it avoids the considerable
costs of procuring cadaver livers.

DEMOCRATS GET HARD FACTS OF BOSTON'S CONVENTION BID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY RAKOWSKY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Pssssst. The Democratic National Committee's visit to
frontrunner Los Angeles was a disaster this week and could endanger
their widely perceived lock on the year 2000 Democratic National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   That was the buzz putting smiles on the faces of Boston
officials Friday as an endless line of number crunchers and
logistical whizzes trotted out details for the DNC's visiting panel
of seven.
</P>
<P>
   Granted the Boston operatives don't know if the rumor was fact
or spin to get the city to give up more loot for the giant bash _
even more than the $32 million already pledged, but they were
bouyed by word that earlier this week Los Angeles officials were
fuzzy on the details of their offer to hold the convention in LA.
</P>
<P>
   Verbal agreements to provide cash and goods in Los Angeles
contrasted sharply with Boston's documented numbers and signatures,
insiders said.
</P>
<P>
   Boston proudly offered pledges in black and white from Fidelity
Investments, John Hancock Financial Services, BankBoston, and Fleet
Bank for $250,000 each. The Chamber of Commerce has promised
$100,000 and Bell Atlantic, $2 million in services and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of morning presentations on everything from
shuttle bus service to transit passes and crime statistics, Joe
Andrew, chairman of the DNC site advisory committee, insisted at a
noon press conference that there is no front runner among the three
finalists. And if the Big Dig was a problem, Andrew said, ``We
wouldn't be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Governor A. Paul Cellucci told the committee the state would
give full support besides the $8 million it has pledged. And
Senator Ted Kennedy had an afternoon cameo appearance to show
support.
</P>
<P>
   The DNC staffers did have a series of detailed queries for
Boston on how it might incorporate more technology in the
convention, said Boston's intergovernmental affairs director Howard
Leibowitz. The questions were heartening, he said, because they
signaled that Boston was still in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew played down the importance of geography for where the
convention will be held, saying it has become more of a television
and Internet operation.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the money the convention host offers, Andrew said it
is still a good deal for the host, if history is a guide. Chicago,
host of the last Democratic convention, offered $27 million to $30
million and reaped direct economic benefits of $175 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great bargain,'' Andrew said.

JUVENILES ESCAPE FROM TEXAS YOUTH FACILITY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALLAN TURNER 
and PATTY REINERT 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRYAN, Texas _ Just two weeks after a murderer escaped Texas'
death row, 11 teen-age inmates, including three violent offenders,
escaped from the state's largest youth correctional facility,
authorities said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday afternoon, five had been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The inmates, ranging in age from 14 to 17, obtained a key to the
fire door in their dormitory at the J.W. Hamilton Jr. State School
and escaped about 7:30 p.m., CST, Thursday. They then used
wirecutters to cut through a fence about 15 yards away, said Judy
Briscoe, director of juvenile corrections for the Texas Youth
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the youths had been incarcerated for assault and
firearms offenses; the other eight are nonviolent offenders,
Briscoe said.
</P>
<P>
   Byran is about 90 miles northwest of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan police arrested five of the youths who had been hiding in
a trailer near the school, said TYC spokeswoman Pamela Ward. All
will face additional charges for escape, which could add nine
months to a year to their sentences. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Escapee Donald R. Flint, a 17-year-old from Houston, telephoned
his parents and advised them he would be home for Christmas,
authorities said, but as of late Friday, he had not been sighted.
Flint was serving time for robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Bain, a 17-year-old from San Antonio, who was charged with
theft, reached his parents' home Friday, along with a few other
escapees. The group fled again when Bain's parents called police.
</P>
<P>
   They apparently stole a staff member's car, which later was
recovered on the campus of Texas A&AMP;M University in College Station,
about 10 miles away. Authorities believe the youths then stole
another vehicle from the campus.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities normally do not reveal the identities of juvenile
offenders, but are allowed to release their names and descriptions
if they escape.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 inmates made their break Thursday evening as a fight
broke out between two other boys in the activity room of Dorm 5,
said Jean Tomlinson, program administrator for the school. They
fled as staff members, who are unarmed, were trying to quell the
fight. Others in the 32-bed dorm apparently were about to bolt as
well, but staff managed to close the door and lock it, Tomlinson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the escape had apparently been planned for
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened real fast,'' Briscoe said. ``Staffers picked up on
the fact that the door was open and they saw the kids running
across the field. They saw the kids get through the fence and then
they separated in three directions.''
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rain hit the Bryan area just minutes after the youths
escaped, and temperatures were in the 40s Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them are in T-shirts and jeans and it is raining, so
they're probably getting pretty cold by now,'' Briscoe said. ``We
hope they are.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Tomlinson said the inmates had been issued winter
clothing Wednesday and Thursday, and some were believed to be
wearing orange sweatshirts and gray pants with the school's name
printed on the legs. They also had access to gloves and knit caps.
All the inmates have short haircuts.
</P>
<P>
   Tomlinson said it was unknown how the youths got the key to the
fire door, but they would have known it existed because they would
have seen it used during fire drills. Authorities also were
investigating how the youths obtained the wirecutters they used to
cut a 4-foot-long slash in the chain-link fence.
</P>
<P>
   The school, a former adult prison northwest of Bryan, was
renovated for juvenile offenders and opened about 1 1/2 years ago.
More than 500 male juvenile offenders are housed in open
dormitories at the school.
</P>
<P>
   The escape took place just one week after authorities found the
body of escaped death row inmate Martin Gurule floating in a creek
near Huntsville. Hundreds of officers had searched for Gurule for
seven days after a dramatic escape late Thanksgiving night. Six
other death row inmates also tried to escape but surrendered before
reaching the fences.

   WASHINGTON, Dec. 11 -- Moderate Republicans who represent
Philly's nearby suburbs, are still on the fence about whether to
impeach Clinton, while the city's three U.S. House Democrats are
standing firm behind the President.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery County's Jon Fox, Delaware County's Curt Weldon, and
Bucks County's Jim Greenwood, are among a group of roughly 40
lawmakers in the House whose ``swing'' vote could help determine
the fate of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Niko Yen, a spokeswoman for Greenwood, said the congressman's
office has been flooded with calls from residents who want to voice
their opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been pretty equal the number of calls we've gotten from
each side,'' Yen said. ``But if it leaned one way it would be that
more people who called were for impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment process gathered steam in Washington Friday, as
the House Judiciary Committee voted on which impeachment charges to
offer up. Clinton addressed the nation in a short speech and
apologized for putting members of congress and the nation through
this process.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, that didn't matter to Philly's three
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Chaka Fattah, Robert Borski, and Bob Brady said they will
not vote to impeach Clinton no matter which impeachment articles
are approved by the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Peck, a spokeswoman for Borski, said he thinks none of the
impeachment articles amount to high crimes and misdemeanors on
which to throw the president out of office.
</P>
<P>
   Fattah's spokeswoman, Rebecca Kersor said the congressman is
leaning toward censure, while the other two Philly Reps. are
undecided on that issue.
</P>
<P>
   Kersor said the city's Representatives were close allies and
were eager to move on with the nation's business.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Fattah) is pretty confident the president will not be
impeached,'' Kersor said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This is how it is to be Bill Clinton these days:
</P>
<P>
   --Describing your desolation over the damage you have done in
the office you dreamed of from boyhood _ only minutes before being
dismissed as a liar and becoming the third president recommended
for impeachment by the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   --Giving baseball's Iron Man, Cal Ripken Jr., and his wife and
kids a tour of your treasured Oval Office on a bright Friday
afternoon, while congressmen a few blocks away debate precisely how
_ in those same rooms _ you touched a young woman not your wife.
</P>
<P>
   --Giving an address on your hopes for peace in Northern Ireland
and Cyprus, then pulling a Republican House member aside to ask how
you can stay the full House from delivering the historic blow of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   --Holding a round of cheery Christmas parties where your guests
gobble your baby lamb chops and speculate, out of your earshot,
whether you will keep your job.
</P>
<P>
   --Attending a private viewing with old friends of ``Enemy of the
State,'' even as you are being accused of being just that.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is as famous for compartmentalizing duty and scandal as
he is notorious for having to do so. For eleven months, he has
resolutely plugged away at his job and smiled for the cameras as
the details of his affair with Monica Lewinsky seeped and then
streamed out.
</P>
<P>
   This week _ in the holiday season, on the cusp of the second
presidential impeachment vote ever in the House _ the polar ends of
Bill Clinton's presidency stretched farther apart than they ever
had.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, in the Rose Garden, he abruptly brought them together
when he addressed the nation. ``There is no greater agony,'' he
said of the pain he has caused his family he said in the brief
address he decided on Thursday night to address doubts that he was
preoccupied by anything except budget meetings and Christmas
shopping.
</P>
<P>
   A trip backward through the week, however, suggests that the
possibility of impeachment has been the thread binding his busy
days together. Clinton attended two funerals, one for a mentor in
Arkansas and one for his vice president's father; he gave an award
to Bill Cosby and accepted one for his work in Northern Ireland. He
beamed for hundreds of grip-and-grin photographs, and sang along _
``ParrUM-pah-pah-pum'' _ to ``The Little Drummer Boy.''
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Clinton's friends and associates say, he was
fretting about the judgment of the House, and of history. Late last
week, he was deeply discouraged _ as down as he had ever been seen,
one Clinton associate said _ but his spirits rebounded somewhat as
he came to believe his fortunes were improving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously he's concerned about the whole impeachment
question,'' said Rev. Philip J. Wogaman of the Foundry United
Methodist Church, who has been providing spiritual advice to
Clinton. ``And he's distressed about his own behavior that led to
it, there's no fudging on that.'' But, he added, ``Even if the
worst comes, and of course he hopes it doesn't, his life will go
on, and he feels that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, as Republican and Democratic lawyers presented
their final arguments, Clinton's distinct worlds seemed to touch,
if glancingly. He had gone to the Department of Agriculture to
unveil a portrait of his old friend and former cabinet secretary,
Michael Espy. Espy has said Clinton made him a promise when he
resigned as agriculture secretary four years ago, but he and the
White House have refused to disclose it.
</P>
<P>
   After the prayers and gospel singing, Clinton stepped up to the
microphone. He referred to Espy's acquittal this month by a jury on
corruption charges brought by an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``With his head held high, he persevered and he triumphed,'' the
president said. He quoted Isaiah: ``Be not afraid. I have redeemed
you.''
</P>
<P>
   And, not incidentally, Clinton made a point of thanking Espy's
lawyers. ``They did a heck of a job,'' he said, and the audience
applauded.
</P>
<P>
   ``So here he is,'' one of those lawyers, Reid Weingarten, said
later. ``Up on the Hill they're saying all kinds of horrible things
about him, and he was so happy for Mike. I mean, who knows with
Clinton, but I had a sense that for that moment he was believing
and feeling everything he was saying, and that must be what gets
him through the day.''
</P>
<P>
   That night, Clinton decided to make another public apology, and
began making notes at the White House residence for the remarks
that he delivered in the Rose Garden Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Clinton left it to his lawyers to defend him
publicly. He received regular briefings on the progress of his
defense, and he questioned aides who were not involved in damage
control about how they thought he was doing. But he has no
television in the Oval Office, and he did not watch the hearings
during the day, associates said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, as the White House began its second day of
defense, Clinton brought the family of an old friend, Sen. Dale
Bumpers, into the Oval Office. ``We were in there a solid 30
minutes on a day like that and you'd never know anything was
wrong,'' said Bumpers' son, Brent Bumpers, a Little Rock lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the president let all six grandchildren sit in his
chair and ``spent five minutes telling us the story of his desk,
the whole history of the ship that brought over the wood that made
the desk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Three, two, one,'' the president counted later that evening,
even as the House Judiciary Committee was toting up four draft
articles of impeachment against him. ``Light the tree!''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday _ one of several late nights for him this week _
Clinton gave two speeches. In one, at a ``Peace on Earth'' gala
held by a group called Peace Links, he offered a wistful
recollection of small town life in Arkansas. There, he said,
``people knew about you, all about you. And they loved you
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second speech, an acceptance of the peace award, he said:
``As long as I am president, I will do everything I can to advance
the cause of peace, democracy and human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   He later pulled aside Rep. Peter T. King, a New York Republican
who opposes impeachment, to talk about Northern Ireland _ and to
ask what he needed to do to rally support in the House. ``If I
didn't know any better or didn't know the topic we were talking
about, I wouldn't have realized how important it was,'' King said.
``He was very calm and very controlled. He was genuinely concerned,
but he was not showing any panic.''
</P>
<P>
   One person familiar with their half-hour conversation said,
``King told him, he had to reach out to other Republicans to find
out what they wanted, that he had to contact any of them that he
had a relationship with.''
</P>
<P>
   This person said that King told the president that many
Republicans were upset at his answers to 81 questions submitted to
the House Judiciary Committee and that he ``had to work on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans seemed to compartmentalize his troubles as much
as the president himself. Speaking Tuesday at a conference convened
by the White House to discuss fixing the Social Security system,
Rep. Clay Shaw, a Republican who says he's undecided on
impeachment, compared Clinton to President Nixon. In a good way.

   ``Like Richard Nixon going to China,'' he said, ``you uniquely
are in a strong position to successfully change the course of
Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   And on Monday night, the Clintons held the annual
``Congressional Ball'' at the White House. The Marine Band played
swing music, and about a thousand guests _ Democrats and
Republicans _ ate shrimp, drank eggnog, and admired the hand-made
ornaments from across the country that decorate the Christmas tree
in the Blue Room.
</P>
<P>
   The chatter among the knots of politicians, according to some
people who were present, returned again and again to impeachment,
as Clinton's guests handicapped his prospects.
</P>
<P>
   The president was downstairs, on the ground floor, in his usual
posture at such affairs: smiling, shaking a hand, exchanging a few
words, posing for a picture, and then reaching for the next hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to visit with him for a hot second,'' said Rep. J.C.
Watts, the Oklahoman who is Republican conference chairman. ``I got
to remind him that the Razorbacks are having a pretty good football
season this year.'' Watts said that he did not discuss impeachment
with the other guests.
</P>
<P>
   Even two Republican members of the House Judiciary Committee _
Bill McCollum of Florida and Elton Gallegly of California _ turned
up for the party. They did not, however, stand in line for a
presidential photograph.

SOLZHENITSYN REJECTS AWARD, CASTIGATES RUSSIAN LEADERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ It was supposed to be the crowning moment in the career
of Russia's most celebrated writer, an overdue gesture of
recognition by the Kremlin for a man whose uncompromising stance
against Communist repression helped hasten the demise of the Soviet
police state.
</P>
<P>
   But as Russia celebrated his 80th birthday Friday, Alexander
Solzhenitsyn, ever the angry dissident, tore up that feel-good
script by refusing Russia's highest cultural award.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the Kremlin announced that President Boris Yeltsin had
awarded Solzhenitsyn the Order of the Apostle St Andrew for
``outstanding services to the Fatherland and for his great
contribution to world literature.''
</P>
<P>
   But Solzhenitsyn, who today attacks Russia's current leaders
with the same messianic zeal he once directed at the Communist
Party, refused in a rare public appearance to accept the award from
``the high authorities who drove Russia to its moribund state.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When people are on hunger strikes for their salaries and
striking, I cannot accept such an award,'' Solzhenitsyn said from
the stage at the Taganka Theater, where his friend and fellow
former Soviet dissident Yury Lyubimov put on a stage version of his
1968 novel, ``The First Circle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe, maybe some time from now, when Russia climbs out of its
quagmire of catastrophies, my sons will accept it for me,'' he
added, as the theater burst into applause.
</P>
<P>
   Solzhenitsyn's daring and frank accounts of the Gulag labor
camps made him a leading voice of the Soviet underground, where
unofficial samizdat copies of his works were eagerly read and
passed around. Smuggled out and published in the West, works like
``The Gulag Archipelago'' and ``The Cancer Ward,'' opened the eyes
of the world to the brutality of the Soviet system and earned
Solzhenitsyn a Nobel prize. They also earned him the wrath of
Communist authorities, who finally sent him into exile in 1974 and
stripped him of his Soviet citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   After two years in Germany, Solzhenitsyn moved to New England,
where he worked in seclusion in a well-guarded compound near
Cavendish, Vermont. Always irrascible, Solzhenitsyn mercilessly
criticized the US that gave him refuge as an immoral society
weakened by prosperity and predicted he would one day return to
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1970s, this seemed like a wild dream. But as the
Communist Party released its grip in the late years of the Soviet
Union, Solzhenitsyn's early works, banned for most of the Communist
era, suddenly became available. They found a willing audience.
Their main theme _ that labor camps were not the exception of
Soviet socialist society, but the very essence of it _ was a
powerful message for people learning for the first time the full
truth about their past. Between 1989 and 1992, millions of copies
of Solzhenitsyn's books and essays were sold in the former Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
   So great was the moral authority of Solzhenitsyn's writing that
upon his return to Russia in 1994, some here thought that he would
assume a leading position in Russian society.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the only person who is capable of uniting the divided,
dispersed unfortunate people under the banner of national rebirth,
and give it back hope and confidence in its strengths,'' wrote the
literary journal Strannik in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   It did not work out that way. Solzhenitsyn has spent the past
few years lamenting Russia's crime-ridden, poverty-stricken state
and railing at the country's current leaders for allowing the the
country to become that way.
</P>
<P>
   This is not so daring in today's Russia, and Solzhenitsyn
gradually has become irrelevent, a dissident writer in a society
that has lost interest in both its dissidents and its writers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Solzhenitsyn was important when his writings said things no
one else dared say,'' said Masha Lipman, deputy editor of Itogi
magazine. ``Russians today don't need anybody to tell them that
they are poor and the authorities are corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, he defied the regime,'' Lipman said. Now, he defies
the people's indifference.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Solzhenitsyn has continued to write
prolifically, but he has faced a number of setbacks. He was kicked
off prime time television show for being boring and irrelevant. He
was ignored during a speech in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   And worst of all for an writer whose works once gripped millions
of readers in Russia and throughout the world, almost no one buys
his books.
</P>
<P>
   His latest work, ``Russia in Collapse'' had an original print
run of only 5,000 when it was released in June, although a second
5,000 copies were later ordered.
</P>
<P>
   The book, a seething denunciation Yeltsin's Russia which
predicted the economic collapse of Aug. 17, much like Solzhenitsyn
once predicted the end of Communism.
</P>
<P>
   His birthday has brought a temporary surge of public attention
for the reclusive writer. Three major television networks have run
documentaries on the writer _ a fourth was taken off the air by the
Solzhenitsyn family's request, in a bit of unintentional irony from
a man who used to have to smuggle his works out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the only writer in Russia to whom the title `great' can
be attached without any hesitation,'' said the liberal business
daily Kommersant this week. ``Of course the rotten Soviet system
would have fallen sooner or later, but it was Solzhenitsyn who
drove the stake through its heart.''

CHILE MOVES TO SUSPEND AIR TRAVEL TO FALKLANDS, ISOLATING BRITONS
THERE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFFORD KRAUSS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile _ In a diplomatic swipe at Britain for its
detention of the former Chilean dictator, Gen. Augusto Pinochet,
the Chilean government moved Friday to suspend all flights between
Chile and the Falkland Islands, cutting off commercial air links
between the British colony and the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative fell well short of breaking relations with
London, as some senior members of the armed forces have advised the
government of President Eduardo Frei to do. But senior government
officials said the action was intended to force Britain into the
embarrassing position of having to consider asking Argentina to
begin flights with the islands.
</P>
<P>
   The measure is also intended to show appreciation to Argentina,
which lost the 1982 Falkland war to Britain, for its support of
Chile's claim that Britain has no right to hold Pinochet for
possible extradition to Spain to stand trial for murder, torture
and other human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the only commercial flights to the Falklands leave
once a week from the southern Chilean city of Puntarenas. Chile is
also the base for daily supply flights to the islands. Argentina,
which continues to claim sovereignty over the islands, has been
pressing London to resume Argentine air links with the Falklands
for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to look for measures to show that we have been
hurt, but we don't want to permanently damage relations with Great
Britain,'' said John Biehl del Rio, Frei's chief of staff. But in a
veiled threat that stronger diplomatic measures, including an
ultimate break, could come, Biehl added, ``If this lasts too long,
you never know how this will end.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza announced Friday that the
government was suspending all diplomatic contacts with Britain and
Spain. On Wednesday Chile recalled its ambassador to London to
protest the decision by Home Secretary Jack Straw to allow
extradition hearings to move forward.
</P>
<P>
   Insulza also said the government would begin pressing private
carriers to cease flying to the Falklands.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Lan Chile, the dominant Chilean carrier, agreed
on Thursday night to suspend flights to the Falklands. Smaller
charter lines will be pressed to follow suit, officials said, and
no resistance is expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became impossible for us to keep our flights going there,''
Biehl said. ``The British will have to rely on Argentine planes,
and they will hate that.''
</P>
<P>
   Frei's decision is designed to show his government's dismay with
the British government for moving forward with extradition hearings
and to reassure the Chilean military that it is trying to defend
Pinochet as strongly as possible. Officials said the president made
the decision on Thursday night in preparations for a meeting with
top military commanders Friday.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, with the Chilean economy slowing, officials
said Frei did not want to jeopardize economic relations with
Britain. Britain is the third leading source of foreign investment
here. It is also a leading provider of military equipment to Chile,
especially ships for the navy.

LIBERAL REPUBLICAN MORELLA WOMAN OF THE HOUR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democrat Geraldine Ferraro hasn't had any luck
getting a call through to her, and the local Republican committee
is resorting to faxing her a letter. That's because Representative
Constance Morella of Maryland is keeping her own counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The six-term lawmaker, considered the House's most liberal
Republican, is in uncommon demand these days as she weighs whether
she will vote to impeach President Clinton. Her decision is
critical since it, along with those of a small group of wavering
GOP moderates, could seal Clinton's fate when articles of
impeachment come to the House floor next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Clinton doesn't get Connie Morella, the ballgame for him is
over,'' said Mark Plotkin, a political analyst for WAMU, the
Washington area's public radio station. ``She is every Democrat's
favorite Republican. If she votes against the president, there is
no real hope for anybody else supporting him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Morella is keeping her constituents _ she represents a
suburban Washington district that is 60 percent Democratic _ in
suspense. She ducks reporters' questions and isn't taking calls.
</P>
<P>
   Friday she stayed home from her Capitol Hill office and watched
the House Judiciary Committee impeachment debate and votes on
television. She listened to Clinton's late-afternoon remarks on the
car radio as she drove to a GOP dinner in Annapolis, the state
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Anne Leary, her press secretary, said Morella is keeping an
open mind while she spends the weekend studying the Judiciary
Committee proceedings and reviewing her mail, e-mail, and phone
messages. Morella has not spoken with either the White House or GOP
leadership, Leary said, and she does not intend to make her
deliberating public.
</P>
<P>
   The silence irks former vice presidential candidate Geraldine
Ferraro, a longtime friend of Morella's. She said that like Maine
Senator Margaret Chase Smith, who in her 1950 Declaration of
Conscience speech condemned the witchhunts of Senator Joseph
McCarthy, women lawmakers need to come forward and say
``impeachment is wrong for the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been watching a lot of television, and I haven't seen any
women speak up and say `this is what I believe,''' said Ferraro,
explaining why she was trying to reach and lobby Morella Friday.
``Women need to exercise leadership, do what is right.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro said she is not coordinating her efforts with the White
House, but rather is acting as an ``American and as a woman.'' In
addition to Morella, who did not call back, Ferraro made
impeachment-related calls to Republican Representatives Marge
Roukema of New Jersey, Tillie Fowler of Florida, Nancy Johnson of
Connecticut, and Sue Kelly of New York.
</P>
<P>
   None of those women, however, has quite the same experience as
Morella _ who has raised nine children, including six of her late
sister's _ and no one has a district quite as Democratic. A native
of Somerville, Mass. and a former school teacher, Morella has kept
her seat by voting against GOP initiatives more often than any
Republican in Congress. She opposed seven of the 10 items in House
Speaker Newt Gingrich's Contract with America, supports abortion
rights, voted against the war in Iraq, and has such a strong
environmental record that she was endorsed in the last election by
the Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton carried Morella's affluent Montogomery County district
with 57 percent of the vote in 1996 and 53 percent of the vote in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   Morella, 67, a quiet, likeable lawmaker who tries not to
antagonize the GOP leadership with her votes, was reelected with 60
percent of the vote in November. The margin would have been higher,
polls showed, if her opponent, civil rights activist Ralph Neas,
had not run television and radio ads criticizing Morella's vote in
October to allow the House to move forward with an impeachment
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``She felt it was absolutely necessary, in fairness to the
country and the president, that all sides be aired,'' said Leary,
explaining Morella's vote.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Haller, president of Potomac Survey Research, a Bethesda,
Md., polling firm, said more than 70 percent of the voters in
Montgomery County are against impeachment. Voting to impeach the
president could be risky for Morella, Haller said, both in her own
district and particularly as she weighs a run for the Senate in the
heavily Democratic state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's likely to be an albatross that will be difficult for her
to shake,'' Haller said. ``But this must be an excruciating dilemma
for a moderate Republican and certainly the hardest vote of
Morella's 12 years in office. With her indecision, it strikes me
that she is teetering.''
</P>
<P>
   Morella is getting pressure from her party. Members of the
Montgomery County Republican Central Committee were meeting Friday
night to draft a letter they will fax to Morella, reminding her she
is a Republican and urging her to vote to impeach the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize we are the minority party in her district, and we
rarely do this, but we feel strongly that Connie Morella should
vote to impeach and remove the president for committing perjury,''
said Robert Miller, the committee's chairman. ``We will be very
disappointed if she doesn't support this view.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, aides to Morella indicated the congresswoman
might entertain a censure resolution instead of impeachment if the
president came forward with more contrition. But appearing this
week at a series of events _ a meeting on the president's race
initiative, a visit to a hospice, a breakfast with business and
civic leaders in the district _ Morella wouldn't tip her hand.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, her offices are being flooded with constituent calls
that are close to evenly split, pro and con, on impeachment, Leary
said. She is also fielding ``99,000 requests'' from journalists who
suddenly want to interview with the usually low-profile Morella.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know know what she is going to do,'' Leary said,
``but that's not what most reporters want to hear.''

OLD WEST RIVALRY FLARES A NEW OVER GAMBLING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CENTRAL CITY, Colo. _ Isolated in the high Rocky mountains, this
elegant old mining town of 600 people stands only a mile from its
sister village of Black Hawk, population 150.
</P>
<P>
   But, in this old gold rush landscape, modern greed over gambling
is plunging the two villages into a municipal feud worthy of the
Hatfields and the McCoys.
</P>
<P>
   The rivalry between the two villages dates back a century or
more, when workers from Black Hawk's sulphurous smelters were
encouraged to take a bath and change their clothes before coming up
to Central City. When flush toilets came to the finer homes here,
Central City residents knew where the waste went when they pulled
the chain _ downstream toward Black Hawk. And because of the
deforestation around the Central City's gold mines, floods
routinely swept down Clear Creek canyon, covering Black Hawk's
streets with mud and rocks.
</P>
<P>
   But ever since limited stakes gambling started here and in Black
Hawk in 1991, Central City, which once billed itself as ``The
Richest Square Mile on Earth'' is not so central anymore. Gamblers
who make the 45-minute drive on a winding canyon road from Denver
to play slot machines reach Black Hawk first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gamblers are basically lazy,'' fumed Gary Kragenbrink, who
served as a councilman in Central City. ``I bet Black Hawk is
really enjoying sticking it to Central now.''
</P>
<P>
   To cut Black Hawk out of some of the gambling action, Central
City started buying and annexing land in a daring plan to extend an
eight mile city ``street'' across some of the roughest mountain
terrain in America. This $64 million, four-lane ``street'' would
drop gamblers directly at an interchange for Interstate 70.
</P>
<P>
   In a counter attack, Black Hawk unveiled blueprints for its own
secret weapon: a $50 million tunnel punched through solid granite.
Funded by casinos, this four-lane tunnel would speed gamblers 1.3
miles through a mountain, depositing them on a road leading to
Black Hawk's busy gambling halls.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, Central City unveiled maps last month that showed it
planned to annex land to block Black Hawk from building a cutoff to
their planned road. In response, Black Hawk revealed that they had
secretly paid an 85-year-old widow $50,000 to buy mining rights
along the route of Central City's proposed casino road.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a big bag of tacks, and I have just just taken out a
handful and spread them out on their road,'' chortled Medill
Barnes, executive director of the Black Hawk Casino Owners
Association. ``This is war, nuclear war.''

<P>
   BOSTON _ Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts proposed
Friday to raise 1999 premiums for its Medex Gold supplemental
insurance for seniors by 9.9 percent to $283.97 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike past Medex increases, which met with sharp opposition
from senior advocates, the proposal was greeted Friday with
relatively mild disapproval.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sorry to see the rate increases, but we are glad that
Medex remains a viable option for seniors who can afford it,'' said
Geoff Wilkinson, executive director of the Massachusetts Senior
Action Council, an advocate group.
</P>
<P>
   Medex Gold, like other so-called medigap supplemental insurance,
helps pay medical bills not covered by Medicare, the federal health
insurance program for seniors and disabled citizens. The plan has
more than 53,700 members.
</P>
<P>
   Medex Gold remains one of a handful of options for seniors who
want unlimited prescription drug coverage. Earlier this year,
Medicare health maintenance organizations in Massachusetts said
they will no longer offer unlimited drug benefits starting Jan. 1.
The change leaves Medex, United HealthCare Insurance Co., and
Hartford Life Insurance Co. as the only plans open to the general
public with unlimited prescription coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed Medex rates require approval by the state's
insurance commissioner, Linda Ruthardt, who has 30 days to act.
Once approved, the rates will become effective March 15.
</P>
<P>
   Because the increases are just under 10 percent, Ruthardt does
not have to call a public hearing on the rates, though she has the
authority to do so. Rate increases at or over 10 percent
automatically trigger a requirement for hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross also proposed to increase premiums for its other
medigap insurance products, including a 4.3 percent hike for Medex
Bronze, 3.9 percent for Medex Core, 9.9 percent for Medex Silver,
8.9 percent for Medex Standard, and 9.9 percent for Medex Basic.
Only Gold, Bronze and Core are accepting new members during open
enrollment period between Feb. 1 and March 31. Of the three plans,
only Gold offers drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed rates, premiums for Medex Bronze would rise
to $110.54 a month, while Medex Core would be $58.99.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Massachusetts Blue Cross plan said its executives
are in discussion with Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Rhode Island
about a range of possible deals, including affiliation or merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some discussions with them, and we hope to continue
those discussions,'' said Peter Meade, executive vice president of
Blue Cross in Massachusetts. ``There are a whole list of
possibilities, from joint marketing to affiliation to the plans
coming together in some form.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Rhode Island Blue Cross confirmed the
preliminary talks with Massachusetts Blue Cross, but added that the
plan had also talked with numerous other potential suitors,
including Wellpoint Health Networks, a former Blue Cross plan in
Southern California that converted into a for-profit insurance
company, and Anthem Inc., a company based in Indianapolis that
operates Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in several states.
</P>
<P>
   ``The field is still wide open,'' said Scott Fraser, the Blue
Cross spokesman in Rhode Island. The plan, which has a commanding
50 percent market share in Rhode Island, this week announced its
third consecutive year of red ink, a projected $22 million loss for
1998. Blue Cross said it would raise premiums 12 percent to 17
percent next year and begin looking for a business partner to cope
with the financial decline.

<P>
   KATMANDU, Nepal _ The little girl became Nepal's official living
goddess the day before she turned 4, a grandly ceremonial event
that made her parents enormously proud, for a divine spirit was
about to enter their daughter and she would be worshipped by the
nation, carried around on a gilded chariot and bowed down to, even
by the king.
</P>
<P>
   But now, seven years later, her parents, Amrit and Namita
Shakya, are sorry they allowed their girl to be plucked from
obscurity and turned into the ornately costumed and fussily
pampered goddess, the royal kumari. By custom, the child has lived
away from her family in a famous 18th-century house in central
Katmandu, leaving this cocoon only 13 times a year, during
festivals.
</P>
<P>
   Approaching puberty, she will soon begin to menstruate, which is
believed to be a sign that her godly power is departing and her
time as the kumari is over. Her parents expect that upon returning
home she will be an unhappy, uneducated and unappreciative
adolescent ex-deity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing what we know now, we would never have agreed to give
her away,'' Shakya, an unemployed driver, said. ``She cannot
properly read or write. She will have to start school far behind
her grade level. She is a very distant child now, like a stranger
to her own family. A child should not be raised away from her
parents, even the royal kumari.''
</P>
<P>
   Adoration of the kumari is one of the epic traditions in this
mountainous nation of 21 million. The girl is said to be the
embodiment of Taleju, a Hindu goddess who befriended an ancient
Nepalese king. In the most common version of the story, the king
once looked lustfully at the beautiful goddess. She took great
offense and vanished, vowing to reappear only in the less seductive
body of a virgin child from a lower-caste family.
</P>
<P>
   By practice the kumari has always been chosen from the Shakya
caste, whose members customarily labored as goldsmiths and often
use the caste name as their surname. Families eagerly tendered
their daughters, and the priests from the royal palace and the
Taleju temple had their pick of girls aged 3 to 5.
</P>
<P>
   The selectors want a child in perfect health with unblemished
skin, big eyes and a full set of teeth. At the same time, the royal
astrologer consults the stars to see which child's horoscope is in
harmony with the king's. Then, in one final trial, the chosen
girl's composure is tested as she is made to walk on bloody ground
through recently severed buffalo heads, their eye sockets lighted
with candles.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, however, Shakya families have not been so
willing to come forward with their daughters. The parents of the
past two kumaris say the selection committee came to their homes,
more to search for volunteers than to sift among aspirants.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tried very hard to convince me,'' Shakya said. ``They
said my daughter would be looked after and this was a good thing.
It was an honor for me. It commands respect. And for my daughter it
meant she would be a goddess to all.''
</P>
<P>
   But he began doubting his decision as soon as he took the child
into Kumari Ghar, a three-story red-brick house built around a
small courtyard near the old palace. Elaborate wood carvings _
peacocks, serpents, gods _ adorn the doorways and windows. The
front entrance is flanked by statues of two white lions with bared
teeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, when I left her I could see she was unhappy, but
she shed no tears until after I was gone,'' said Shakya, 37,
looking as if he had been ambushed by an unwelcome memory. ``They
told us she wept for hours afterward. I had such mixed feelings. I
had to keep reminding myself that my daughter was being made a
goddess.''
</P>
<P>
   A man named Juju Bhai oversees the young goddess' life. For
generations, members of his wife's family have been the custodians
of Kumari Ghar. They support themselves and maintain the property
with donations left in a courtyard collection box or at the
kumari's slippered feet.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's daily routine is quite restricted. She is allowed
playmates, but no games can take her outside or risk the opening of
a wound _ a show of blood that would prematurely empty her of
divine power. Her diet is spared anything that might upset her
stomach.
</P>
<P>
   For a few hours, the kumari's forehead is painted in red and her
eyes are surrounded by black circles that tail off toward her ears
like calligraphy. Supplicants are permitted to visit her,
beseeching a silent blessing. Tourists gather in the courtyard,
hoping to glimpse her from a designated window. Her custodians see
to it that she makes an occasional appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The Shakyas, who have two other children, are allowed to call on
their daughter occasionally. While Shakya tries to go once a week,
his wife finds the meetings too painful. ``We are parents in name
only, and this will be true until our daughter comes back home,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   They have quarreled with Juju Bhai about the girl's education.
Nepal is a constitutional monarchy, and though King Birendra has
limited power, the oversight of Kumari Ghar is still a matter
handled by the palace.
</P>
<P>
   At a festival in May, as her daughter sat in a throne on her
chariot, Mrs. Shakya squeezed through the guards and handed the
king a petition, asking that the goddess be given more tutoring. A
royal secretary has pledged to look into the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no arrangement for proper schooling,'' said Pragya
Devi, the mother of the previous kumari. ``My daughter Rashmila was
not prepared to have a life after her time as a goddess was over.
She had to sit by the side of her younger brother, enrolled in the
second grade at the age of 12. This was a very painful thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently education for any girl, including a goddess, was
not much of an issue here. But Nepal, however much it clings to
familiar rituals, is modernizing. In an urban capital like
Katmandu, most parents want their daughters to have careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as Rashmila was a goddess, people respected her, but
once she retired, it was like being discarded,'' Mrs. Devi said.
``No one cared what became of her.''
</P>
<P>
   Rashmila, now 18, is studying for exams that might win her a
place in college. She is a shy, serious young woman who at times
has complained of depression. The adjustment to post-Kumari life
has been demanding, but unlike her mother she has few regrets.
</P>
<P>
   She recalls how strong she felt with the divine power within
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never sneezed,'' she said. ``I never once had a fever. I was
truly someone special. I met the king, and the king bowed down. It
was a good time for me. I can remember playing with my dolls and
toys in a spacious room. The caretakers were like a second set of
parents. They gave me all I needed and restrained me in only one
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could never leave.''

&HT;        SUBURBAN REPS UNDECIDED ON WHETHER TO IMPEACH, PHILLY DEMS
WON'T
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON, Dec. 11 -- Moderate Republicans who represent
Philly's nearby suburbs, are still on the fence about whether to
impeach Clinton, while the city's three U.S. House Democrats are
standing firm behind the President.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery County's Jon Fox, Delaware County's Curt Weldon, and
Bucks County's Jim Greenwood, are among a group of roughly 40
lawmakers in the House whose ``swing'' vote could help determine
the fate of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Niko Yen, a spokeswoman for Greenwood, said the congressman's
office has been flooded with calls from residents who want to voice
their opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been pretty equal the number of calls we've gotten from
each side,'' Yen said. ``But if it leaned one way it would be that
more people who called were for impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment process gathered steam in Washington Friday, as
the House Judiciary Committee voted on which impeachment charges to
offer up. Clinton addressed the nation in a short speech and
apologized for putting members of congress and the nation through
this process.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, that didn't matter to Philly's three
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Chaka Fattah, Robert Borski, and Bob Brady said they will
not vote to impeach Clinton no matter which impeachment articles
are approved by the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Peck, a spokeswoman for Borski, said he thinks none of the
impeachment articles amount to high crimes and misdemeanors on
which to throw the president out of office.
</P>
<P>
   Fattah's spokeswoman, Rebecca Kersor said the congressman is
leaning toward censure, while the other two Philly Reps. are
undecided on that issue.
</P>
<P>
   Kersor said the city's Representatives were close allies and
were eager to move on with the nation's business.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Fattah) is pretty confident the president will not be
impeached,'' Kersor said.

TOO SERIOUS FOR A MUSICAL? IT'S ALWAYS BEEN SO

<P>
   I happened to be in a secondhand bookstore a while ago and came
across a copy of ``Climate of Eden,'' by Moss Hart, a play I didn't
know by a writer I admire. The play had a short run on Broadway and
was therefore deemed to be a ``failure.'' What turned out to
interest me more than the play was the author's introduction, in
which he listed all the things that ailed the Broadway theater at
that time (the early 1950s).
</P>
<P>
   I was astonished to note that nothing, nothing has changed.
Rising ticket prices. Dwindling audiences. Cantankerous critics.
Overworked authors. Boorish producers. To that should be added
unlikely subject matters for musicals.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since ``Show Boat'' and probably ever since the Greeks,
people have been talking about how certain subjects seem
``inappropriate'' for Broadway musicals. It seems to me that
virtually everything is appropriate to the musical form. When you
think of it, the most unlikely gallery of subjects has been the
basis for most of our great musicals.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it: Most shows sound ridiculous when boiled down to a
few descriptive sentences. A musical about the settling of the
Oklahoma territory? Ugh. A musical about a barber who slits his
customer's throats? Yuk. A musical (two actually) about a Jewish
man who leaves his wife for another man who eventually dies of
AIDS? Forget it. A musical about the sinking of the ``Titanic''? Oh
please. What next? A musical about the signing of the Declaration
of Independence? You must be nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``Oklahoma!,'' ``Sweeney Todd,'' ``Falsettos,'' ``Titanic,''
``1776'' and about a zillion other shows are part of the rich and
moving legacy of 20th-century American theater.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect that people do not really mean unlikely or
inappropriate when they address this perennial topic; they really
mean serious. For reasons that are baffling, one still hears people
remark that such and such a topic doesn't really seem
``appropriate'' for a musical. This, after almost a century of
beautiful, successful, serious musicals!
</P>
<P>
   Certainly we have heard this about ``Parade,'' the musical about
the Leo Frank case. Just the other day a very nice woman told me
she assumed ``Parade'' was a play and not a musical, because she
couldn't imagine the story set to music. I hope she will feel
differently after she sees it.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Parade'' is not so much a musical about the Leo Frank case
as it is a musical about two mismatched people _ Leo Frank and his
wife, Lucille _ who grow to depend on, appreciate and eventually
love each other because of the Frank case. A good love story is,
after all, the centerpiece of many musicals. It's no surprise then,
and it is clear why Jason Robert Brown, Alfred Uhry, and Hal Prince
(our composer-lyricist, book writer and director) were drawn to
musicalize this complex couple trapped by a horrifying example of
American injustice.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, no matter how unusual, kinky or subversive the subject
may seem at first glance, at the heart of most musicals is
something quite common and traditional: our shared humanity.
</P>
<P>
   A final thought: if people persist in feeling that the Broadway
musical must be light and undemanding (something that history
belies) then it is up to the nonprofit or institutional theaters of
this country to produce serious musical work. For years I have felt
that nonprofit theaters must support and produce the work of
American composers and lyricists and give them a home, just as they
have given homes to so many American playwrights.
</P>
<P>
   This is difficult work, demanding and costly. But if the
hundreds of institutional theaters will follow the example of the
few like the Playwrights' Horizons and Public Theater in New York,
the American Musical Theater Festival in Philadelphia and the
Goodman Theater in Chicago that have attempted to take on the
American musical in the last 20 years, we may all live to read an
essay in a newspaper or journal that celebrates our musical theater
because it has always embraced unlikely subject matters.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime we have to hope that if a show ``sings'' to its
creators, they in turn will write a show that will ``sing'' to us.

 &HT;    Tighter quarter leads to lower profit estimates
 &HT;    By David McNaughton
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_ Coca-Cola's stock dropped 4.8 percent Friday and
analysts started cutting their earnings estimates again after the
company warned its fourth-quarter profit will be below
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The company's third-quarter earnings were below original
projections, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is nothing different than what is going on with Gillette
and Procter &AMP; Gamble,'' said Dana H. Halberg, president of the
Arden Group, an Atlanta money management firm.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings disappointments reflect lower demand because of
economic problems around the world and are affecting all companies
with global sales, not just Coca-Cola, Halberg added.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola, which produces three-fourths of its profit overseas,
said it expects to report fourth-quarter earnings of 24 to 25 cents
a share. Wall Street analysts had predicted a profit of 30 cents a
share, against 32 cents earned a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In reaction to the news, five of the 11 analysts who follow the
company trimmed their profit projections. The analysts cut their
full-year 1998 forecast to $1.40 a share from $1.46, according to
First Call, which tracks estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Those same analysts reduced their 1999 forecasts to a range of
$1.40 to $1.55 a share, said Chuck Hill, director of research at
First Call. The average forecast for 1999 had been as high as $1.79
a share.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola blamed ``continued economic and political
uncertainty'' in announcing worldwide unit case volume would be
down ``slightly'' in the fourth quarter. Case volume was up 10
percent in the 1997 quarter, a period that included more shipping
days, the company noted.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola specifically cited economic uncertainty in Brazil,
Germany, Japan, Russia, Southeast Asia, Venezuela and Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The company also said the changing value of other currencies vs.
the dollar is still hurting earnings, to the tune of 10 percent in
both the fourth quarter and all of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Those problems may make the next couple of years ``rough'' for
Coca-Cola, said analyst John C. Maxwell of Davenport &AMP; Co. in
Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell cut his 1999 earnings estimate to $1.40 a share, making
him the most pessimistic of the analysts who made changes Friday.
He now expects Coca-Cola's first-half earnings in 1999 to be below
those of the comparable 1998 period, when the company earned 82
cents per share including one-time items.
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell also looks for the third-quarter results to be about the
same as Coca-Cola reported for this year's July-September quarter,
or 35 cents a share, excluding a gain.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Maxwell said he likes Cola-Cola long-term, echoing the
sentiments of other analysts.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Jennifer F. Solomon of Salomon Smith Barney,
upgraded her rating on Coca-Cola stock to ``buy'' from ``neutral,''
according to Dow Jones News Service. She suggested in a research
note that the stock price currently reflects expectations for
slower earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
   While Friday's warning was a surprise, Halberg does not expect
Coca-Cola shares to decline sharply, unless the overall market
takes a tumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``This stock will probably go sideways for a while,'' Solomon
said.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola, which is a major holding in many of the portfolios
managed by the Arden Group, has a built-in cushion against
declines, Halberg suggested, partly because of the loyalty of
investors like Warren E. Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, and
SunTrust Banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have people who aren't going to sell. And for those who
sell, you have a company that is going to buy back some stock,
probably,'' Halberg noted.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors who have kept Coca-Cola over the years have
become millionaires, even though the stock hasn't risen every year.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Coca-Cola has traded as high as $87.93 3/4. But
Friday's decline of $3.18 3/4 to $66.06 1/4 means the stock is now
down 5.7 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   If the stock finishes with a loss for the year, it would be the
first time that has happened since 1980, when the shares fell 3.3
percent.

QUESTIONS AMID THE INFAMY

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an extraordinary 15-minute period Friday, all of
the maneuvering, solemnity, drama and historic high stakes of Bill
Clinton's disgrace and defense were on full display.
</P>
<P>
   It began with the president of the United States, standing in
the Rose Garden in the thickening dusk of a December afternoon,
expressing his shame and his sorrow _ and showing, for the first
time in public, the fear of more humiliation to come.
</P>
<P>
   It ended with the solemn drumbeat of yeas and nays _ single
syllables uttered in conscience and headed for history _ in the
very same panelled committee chamber where Richard Nixon's
impeachment resolutions were passed a quarter-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Washington finally had its 15 minutes of infamy, but still the
questions lingered lingered in the chilly air of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Was it enough for Clinton to express his sorrow, admit his
deceit, speak of his ``wrongful conduct'' and allude to his pain,
or would it appear like a deathbed conversion, a desperate gambit
designed to sway the few Republican moderates who _ nervously,
portentously but undeniably _ hold his destiny in their hands?
</P>
<P>
   And will the House now to press ahead to impeach the president
on a party-line vote, freed to do by its assumption that the
Senate, with its 55-45 Republican majority, does not contain 67
lawmakers who are willing to remove Clinton from office?
</P>
<P>
   With six days until the House meets for the first time in 130
years to take up presidential impeachment _ Nixon resigned in
August 1974 rather than be impeached _ the events crystalized the
Washington struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Friday President Clinton again acknowledged his misdeeds,
apologized for them, expressed his sorrow and repeated his
determination to press on _ all in one statement. New was his
willingness to accept punishment. Friday the House Judiciary
Committee sent impeachment resolutions to the floor and set up a
debate and vote that, in turn, could put the president on trial in
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The two events bracketing that remarkable quarter-hour
displayed, as no other events in this 11-month-old melodrama have,
the enormous pressures, weighty considerations and historic
implications of an episode that began as an office affair and ended
up as an affair of state.
</P>
<P>
   The president, accustomed to speaking from strength, appealed to
the Congress and the public from weaknesses human and political:
The human weakness that drew him into a reckless relationship with
Monica S. Lewinsky. The human weakness that caused him to dissemble
and, as he put it Friday, give into his shame. The political
weakness that resulted in the substitution of a Democratic Congress
for a Republican Congress that made impeachment plausible. And the
political weakness that forced him to seek forgiveness and mercy
from a Republican Congress that now makes impeachment seem
possible, even likely.
</P>
<P>
   His audience was not the House Judiciary Committee members who,
only minutes later, pressed ahead with their resolution of
impeachment; their determination to do so was well known and widely
expected. His audience was, instead, the American people, who
oppose impeachment and might yet persuade their representatives to
turn away from it, and Republican moderates, the elusive and
critical factor in next week's House voting.
</P>
<P>
   That the president made his remarks Friday was itself a measure
of the president's weakness. White House officials were growing
worried that if he waited until he returned from the Middle East
early next week many of those moderates might already have
committed themselves publically to vote for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the House Judiciary Committee was preparing for its
fateful vote on the first article of impeachment, Clinton was
seeking to change the debate, saying for the first time that he was
``prepared to accept'' a rebuke and censure from the House, the
body that the founders intended to be the voice of the American
people.
</P>
<P>
   But in saying that he would accept what had never been done
before _ earlier censures, by the Senate of Andrew Jackson in 1834
and by the House of James Buchanan, were not, in an expression that
has new meaning in the 1990s, consensual _ the president was in
fact campaigning for censure.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who was
reprimanded by the House in 1990 for a sex-related incident, has
argued that congressional condemnation was ``no triviality.'' But,
by any measure, censure is far less demeaning than impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   A report prepared this fall for House members by the
Congressional Research Service notes that censure might have
political or historical implications but that it has ``no
particular legal or constitutional consequence.'' The Constitution
makes no provision for congressional censure of the president, but
the Congress is free to pass any non-binding resolution it likes
without fear of it being overturned by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We vote for our honor, which is the only thing we get to take
with us to the grave,'' Judiciary Committee chairman Henry J. Hyde
of Illinois said as the proceedings began Friday morning. Then, in
the extraordinary 15 minutes of Friday afternoon, the difference in
the ways the principals view the impeachment question _ indeed, the
difference in the ways they view honor _ was made plain.

 &HT;    Pepsi stoic, but industry observers say it hurts
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the never-ending cola wars, Coca-Cola Co. has
dropped what amounts to an atomic bomb on archrival Pepsico.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Pepsico _ at least publicly _ said little Friday
about the deal in which Coca-Cola will purchase Cadbury Schweppes'
brands outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, we're going to have to take a close look at every
aspect of this deal,'' said Pepsico spokesman Brad Shaw. ``Beyond
that, there's really nothing else we can say.''
</P>
<P>
   But others weren't as tight-lipped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It changes things substantially,'' said Tom Pirko, a New
York-based beverage consultant. ``Remember those adventure stories
you used to watch on TV or in the movies, where a person is
standing in a room and the walls start closing in and that person
is holding out his arms to keep that from happening? Well, for
Pepsi, the walls are getting uncomfortably closer.''
</P>
<P>
   For some industry experts, a more likely pairing in fact would
have been Cadbury Schweppes and Pepsico.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a constant set of rumors,'' Pirko said. ``Even though
everyone talked about Cadbury and Pepsi, there was an essential
unwillingness there. There's more of an affinity there between the
companies (Pepsico and Cadbury) because they're No. 2 and No. 3 and
the fact that they've already done some business together. Everyone
always wants to team up against No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, it will become harder for Pepsico to ``defend itself
against a company with that much punching power.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepsico declined to comment on any possible talks with Cadbury.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsico has become increasingly aggressive this year in trying
to take market share from No. 1 Coca-Cola. It has sued the
Atlanta-based company in New York federal court, alleging antitrust
violations in the way Coke structures its contracts with
independent food service distributors. Coca-Cola denies the claims.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsico also is fighting Coke's efforts to purchase and expand
its reach in India and France. And the launch of Pepsi One, a
one-calorie diet soft drink, is designed to undercut the popularity
of Diet Coke. The company is expected to spend $100 million
promoting Pepsi One over the next 12 months, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Pepsi is going to look very carefully at this deal,''
said John Sicher, publisher of Beverage Digest. ``Pepsi has been,
in the last couple of months, performing very strong in the U.S.
... Basically, as with any deal in the soft drink industry, how it
plays out and how it affects competitive dynamics simply won't be
known for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are certainly good and strong brands Coke is buying, so
in certain markets Coke is in an even more stronger competitive
situation,'' Sicher said.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, just days ago Cadbury Schweppes' Plano, Texas-based
U.S. unit announced it had renewed a distribution contract with
Pepsico's Pepsi Bottling Group for the company's Dr Pepper and 7UP
brands. Under the agreement, Pepsi Bottling, which is scheduled to
be spun off from Pepsico in 1999, bottles and distributes 32
percent of Cadbury's soft drinks sold in the United States. By
contrast, Coca-Cola handles 24 percent of Cadbury's domestic
distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsico's Shaw said the Coca-Cola-Cadbury Schweppes deal would
have no impact on its existing U.S. agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bellas, chairman and chief executive officer of Beverage
Marketing Corp., said the deal puts another arrow in Coke's quiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``They keep chipping away, adding one (market) share, then two
shares, then when you wake up 10 years from now, it's really piled
up,'' he said. ``In Atlanta, they are long-term players.

SANTAS ARRESTED OUTSIDE ROCKEFELLER CENTER FOR FALSE SOLICITING  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By KIT R. ROANE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Yes Virginia, there is a Santa Claus. But be wary,
little girl, because not all Santas are real, or even very nice.
</P>
<P>
   Some young children became aware of that sad possibility on
Thursday night when New York City police officers at Rockefeller
Center carted off two handcuffed men, each dressed as the famous
Claus.
</P>
<P>
   It was bad enough that the accused, Alzumar Jenkins, 24, and
Louis Nicklas, 45, had the temerity to impersonate the purveyor of
Christmas cheer and expensive gifts, police officials said. Even
worse, investigators said, the plump men in red were fraudulently
soliciting donations in the name of charity.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps taking a page out of the Grinch's playbook, one fake
Santa working Rockefeller Center had earlier assaulted a properly
trademarked Santa doing good works for the Volunteers of America
Greater New York, pushing him off his corner and stealing his bell
in an apparent attempt to muscle in on his business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may or may not have been one of the Santas we arrested
because all Santas kind of look alike,'' said Deputy Inspector
Robert Martin, commanding officer of the department's special
investigations division. ``But we are trying to get the word out to
people who think this is an easy scam, that it's not, particularly
if you are going to bully a legitimate Santa off his corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will look at that very severely,'' the inspector added,
saying that he was particularly unnerved by reports that children
had witnessed ``two Santas rolling around'' in the assault on
Wednesday afternoon. Though the police were called to the scene,
``the bad Santa'' had already escaped, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers of America Greater New York first alerted the police
to the illegal Santa problems a few days ago, after their
volunteers noticed several strangers impersonating them to collect
money around Rockefeller Center. The charitable organization, whose
distinctive Santa look is trademarked, has eight Santas collecting
donations at busy shopping and tourist sites in midtown Manhattan.
The money is used to provide services to the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Linda McNeil, a spokeswoman for the organization, said that her
volunteers had seen other suspicious Santas in years past but that
the impostors had been too fleet-footed for capture. This year,
however, the fraudulent Santas have become more bold, not only
professing to work for Volunteers of America, but also intent on
stealing the territory of real volunteers in the Rockefeller Center
area. The police stationed undercover officers there on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The officers were astonished by what they saw shortly before
arresting the men around 8 p.m. The police said one illegal Santa
peacefully worked around the edges of the center, walking about and
asking passers-by for charitable donations. But another Santa
stationed near the Christmas tree had a more elaborate scheme to
defraud his customers, who also lined up to take photographs with
him at $5 a shot, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was working with a group of elves who were steering people
to him,'' said Inspector Martin, adding that ``the elves had little
Santa hats on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The money was being passed between the elves and the Santa,
who kept some of the money in his Christmas sack,'' he said. No elf
impersonators were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Several things gave the fake Santas away, the inspector said.
Each of the trademarked Santas used by the Volunteers of America
has a red suit with a distinctive white belt, a green button with
the charity's name on it, a bell and a 3{-foot-high black chimney
for donations. The fraudulent Santas wore red suits with black
belts and moved about without the chimney or green button.
</P>
<P>
   The Santas also continued to solicit donations well beyond the
11 a.m.-to-7 p.m. schedule adhered to by the volunteer Santas, who
are picked up by a car service at the end of their shifts. While
the volunteers do work with elves, the elves merely guard the
donations while Santa stretches his legs or goes for his morning
constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins, 24, and Nicklas, 48, have both been charged with
scheming to defraud, criminal impersonation and petty larceny, the
police said. If convicted of the most serious charge, scheming to
defraud, the men face up to four years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Inspector Martin said that both Jenkins, of Passaic, N.J., and
Nicklas, of Queens, N.Y., have minor criminal records, though
neither has a history of Santa impersonation.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By word and deed, in answering pollsters' questions
and in casting midterm ballots last month, a majority of the voters
of America have made it pluperfectly clear that they do not wish to
see President Clinton removed from office through the impeachment
process.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee are
charging down the road that leads to precisely that. Nothing anyone
has said or done, not the harsh words of some of the president's
defenders on the committee, not the softer words of his lawyers
testifying before it, not even Clinton's own 11th-hour statement
Friday afternoon, stayed the Republicans' hands.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lindsey Graham, an iconoclast from South Carolina, said
before Clinton spoke that he might opt for censure instead of
impeachment if the president admitted in some way to ``criminal
wrongdoing.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a short, subdued four-minute speech, Clinton came nowhere
near to doing that. Instead, he said he would accept censure _
something his aides have been saying for days _ reiterated his
remorse over his conduct _ something Graham had derided before the
fact as ``another lip-biting apology'' _ and called again for
everyone to buckle down to doing the nation's work.
</P>
<P>
   Anticlimax perfumed the air a few minutes later when Graham and
the 20 other Republican committee members voted for the first
article of impeachment to come before them, which accuses Clinton
of perjury. All but one voted for a second perjury article early
Friday evening, with Graham breaking ranks on that occasion. White
House nose-counters have told the president he stands no better
than an even chance of avoiding impeachment on one article by the
full House next week, which would set up a Senate trial in January.
</P>
<P>
   It was a historic day, of course, as everyone kept saying, but
banal as well, utterly lacking in the soaring language and
high-minded debate that transfixed the nation a quarter-century
ago, in July, 1974, when the committee voted articles of
impeachment against Richard Nixon. At one point members picked nits
with each other over whether Clinton had been properly sworn for
his grand jury testimony in the Monica Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The session had the compelling drama of a debate on a highway
bill. Some spectators' seats were empty. Network television gave it
a pass.
</P>
<P>
   That could be accounted for, at least in part, by the almost
universal belief in Washington that the Republicans will fail to
muster the two-thirds vote that would be needed to convict Clinton
and remove him from office. In a sense, the Judiciary Committee
Republicans had a free play, like a quarterback who can throw a
pass without fear of interception when a penalty against the
defensive team has been whistled before he releases the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the House Republican whip, stated the
thesis the other day. Impeachment, he said, is ``like a grand jury
that looks at the evidence, and the House decides whether the
evidence warrants sending it to the Senate for trial.'' Rep. Bob
Barr, R-Ga., echoed his words Friday afternoon, telling his
colleagues that what they were doing was ``similar to drafting an
indictment'' in a criminal case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impeachment in the House, acquittal in the Senate,'' said
another Republican member, ``is super-censure, the most effective
we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Some disagreed, of course. Rep. Barney Frank, the cerebral
Massachusetts Democrat, said gruffly that in voting to impeach
Clinton, the Republicans were ``voting for a resolution that says
you want him thrown out of office,'' like it or not. From the
viewpoint of most Democrats, approval in the committee makes
approval in the House more likely, and a Senate trial, regardless
of the outcome, would take time and sully Clinton's reputation even
further.
</P>
<P>
   He would be only the second president ever to face trial in the
Senate, after Andrew Johnson, and his ability to function
effectively, already eroded, would be further curtailed. Even now,
he is neither trusted on Capitol Hill nor feared by Saddam Hussein
and other enemies of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, some Republican members who harbored private
qualms no doubt took refuge behind the conviction that nothing they
did Friday was final. That assumption, like so many others in this
saga, may prove falacious, but at the moment it is pervasive.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the explanation for Friday's vote is more complicated than
that.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republican representatives have seen Clinton as unfit for
the presidency almost from the start of his term, and have never
considered voting any other way than they way they voted Friday.
Barr, the first member to call for impeachment, is described by his
colleagues as falling into that category. He is not alone.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans members, especially outside the committee,
have been offended by White House tactics. Once ready, or almost
ready, to give Clinton the benefit of the doubt, they have hardened
against him.
</P>
<P>
   When his party did far better than anticipated in the elections
last month, Clinton and his advisers, like President Nixon and his,
concluded that the impeachment campaign had spent its momentum.
They mistook a break in the clouds for lasting sunshine. Abandoning
their conciliatory tone, the president's lawyers sent provocatively
unresponsive answers to 81 questions posed by the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Some were also highly critical of Clinton's efforts to mobilize
business leaders in their districts to accuse them of harming the
economy by pressing ahead with impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The politics of the situation are complex and by no means always
decisive. Rep. Marge Roukema of New Jersey, a moderate who might
have drawn a conservative primary challenge if she had voted
against impeachment, decided to vote for it. Rep. Amo Houghton of
upstate New York, another moderate, was in a similar situation; his
stand against impeachment evoked a threat from Jim Pierce, a
heretofore marginal conservative candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, some Republicans said they thought a vote to impeach
would prove, in the long run, to be popular with the electorate and
therefore helpful at election time in 2000. Others thought not,
though several said that public opposition to ousting Clinton was
combined with an indifference that had made it very difficult for
the president to rally public support.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, leading Republicans on the committee spoke of
principle and of the necessity of doing one's duty without regard
to the polls' verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, the committee's 74-year-old
chairman, urged his colleagues to ``vote for our honor, which is
the only thing we get to take with us to the grave.'' A similar
tack was taken by Rep. Bob Inglis, a South Carolina Republican, in
his own 10-minute statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank goodness we're not a pure democracy,'' he said, because
that would mean the majority always ruled, on every issue. If
Baptists outnumbered Roman Catholics, he continued, they could
outlaw Mass if they wished to.
</P>
<P>
   But instead, Inglis said, ``we're a constitutional republic,''
whose legislators owe allegiance to that document and not to public
whim.

US AGENCY RECOMMENDS IDENTIFYING AIDS-POSITIVE PATIENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After repeated delays and months of contentious
debate within the Clinton administration, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention has for the first time recommended that
health-care providers report the names of individuals testing
positive for the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC guidelines, which are open for a public comment for 30
days, would allow states to adopt whatever system they choose to
track the epidemic as long as it provides high-quality data. But
the center ``advises'' states to adopt names-based reporting rather
than a system that uses codes to hide the identify of infected
indivduals.
</P>
<P>
   While AIDS activists and health-care providers welcomed improved
``surveillance'' or tracking of the epidemic, they said mandatory
reporting of names is self-defeating and warned that it will only
increase _ rather than diminish _ the public health risk of more
infection and death.
</P>
<P>
   The stigma of AIDS and the human immunodeficiency virus, they
say, is still powerful enough to steer people away from testing if
they have to identify themselves by name.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't produce the names that such a system depends upon for
success,'' said Steven Fisher, communications director for the
Washington-based AIDS Action group. ``Individuals at risk should be
tested often, voluntarily and confidentiality.''
</P>
<P>
   The CDC plans to implement its new guidelines after 30 days.
Though the agency says it will give states wide leeway, states as
well as public and private health-care providers fear the agency
will channel funding toward systems that require names reporting.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines are a compromise after what one high-ranking
administration official described as ``hearty debates on all
levels.'' Privacy concerns, in fact, prompted the CDC to allow
states to implement alternative ``unique identifier'' systems _
even though it had a strong preference for names only _ and to
strongly urge states to maintain anonymous HIV testing sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CDC recognizes that confidentiality concerns are valid and
that's why the CDC is not closing the door to other systems,'' said
Laurie Boeder, spokeswoman for the Human Health and Services
Department. ``The CDC will provide technical assistance and funding
to all states _ but they must meet certain performance standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Names-reporting, Boeder pointed out, has always been
successfully used to track epidemics such as syphyllis and
tuberculosis -- with very few breaches of confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly understand concerns about confidentiality,'' said
Kevin M. De Cock, director of CDC's HIV/AIDS prevention division,
in an interview this summer. ``Terrible things could happen
someplace, somewhere, but experience says this hasn't happened so
far.''
</P>
<P>
   The push to expand HIV surveillance _ tracking how and where the
virus strikes so prevention and treatment is better focused _ began
in 1996 when the number of AIDS cases began to drop for the first
time, while HIV infections increased.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 30 states now require names reporting, while half a
dozen, including Massachusetts, are developing or have implemented
code-based systems. But many states with the highest HIV-infected
populations, including California, are now debating what kind of
tracking system to adopt.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC has said it favors names because special codes that
contain personal information without revealing identity are not
necessarily reliable or efficient. States using codes have battled
problems with reliability and completeness of information, the CDC
said.
</P>
<P>
   State administrators who run these programs reject the CDC's
analysis as flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even within the administration there remains a deep
unease about ``the possible impact of names-based systems on the
willingess of certain populations to seek HIV testing,'' said the
official, who asked for anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Communities increasingly hard-hit by HIV are not white and
homosexual, as they once were, but poor, black, Hispanic and
immigrant communities, according to the CDC. But these communities,
providers say, already are marginalized and fearful of government
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it would only send further people underground because
the fear and stigma of being HIV-positive is still so great,'' said
Barbara Gomes-Beach, executive director of the Multicultural AIDS
Coalition in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   A CDC-funded survey published in October by the Journal of the
American Medical Association found that anonymous testing increases
the chances that individuals test themselves early and seek care.

   Broadway musicals that explore daring subjects always push the
envelope of acceptability but with varying results: some find their
audiences, others don't. Of the ones that don't, some just aren't
done well and would fail no matter what the subject matter. Others
electrify their audiences, even get good notices, but still fail at
the box office because of an underlying uneasiness on the part of
the public. This was my experience with ``Side Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on my beginnings with ``Side Show,'' I recall being
taken aback when Bill Russell (the show's book writer and lyricist)
and Bobby Longbottom, (the director and choreographer) asked me to
be the composer of a musical featuring the Siamese twins Daisy and
Violet Hilton. Siamese twins? It seemed a rather bizarre and
possibly risky subject, but I had admired Bill and Bobby's
off-Broadway musical ``Pageant,'' in which beauty contestants were
imaginatively and entertainingly portrayed by an all-male cast.
Quite a feat.
</P>
<P>
   And after all, hadn't such a show as ``Kiss of the Spider
Woman'' with its homosexuality in a South American jail cell, found
its audience? And how about ``Rent'' and its East Village drug
addicts, transvestites and AIDS victims? A solid hit. The three of
us agreed that the Hilton sisters' story was well worth telling but
would need to be handled with great sensitivity; would need to
touch on issues like duality, compromise, conflict, exploitation,
yearning, courage and love, and should examine who and what is
``normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill and I began creating songs and recitative and soon realized
we were mining a rich vein of possibilities. Far from being a
problem for us, our offbeat subject propelled us, offering an
endless stream of ideas. The experiment grew and became our shared
culture.
</P>
<P>
   Once we had a first draft, Bill and Bobby and I arranged a
rehearsed reading so that we could hear our show interpreted by
actors. The veteran producer Emmanuel Azenberg attended and
expressed interest. Our unconventional musical was being taken
seriously by a producer.
</P>
<P>
   As we moved forward, we took pains to make the Hilton twins
fully drawn human beings, much ``like everyone else'' (as they sing
in Act I); to endow them with senses of humor like the real Daisy
and Violet. We explored what we imagined to be the special intimacy
between conjoined sisters, both in serious scenes and in
lighthearted vaudeville numbers. We assiduously avoided eliciting
pity for them.
</P>
<P>
   Azenberg produced a second reading for potential investors who
laughed and cried in all the right places. In September 1996, he
and his investors produced a series of staged readings at the
Richard Rogers Theater and the audiences went wild. Hundreds and
hundreds of people were showing unbridled enthusiasm for our show,
and naturally the creators and producers alike were greatly
encouraged. We were pushing the envelope, and the results looked
very exciting.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, we opened on Broadway to many excellent reviews,
including those of Ben Brantley and Vincent Canby of The New York
Times. Audiences were giving the show heartfelt standing ovations.
Our publicity department was getting excellent press coverage on
television and in print. How could we fail to catch on? We had
proceeded carefully, step by step, nursing our unusual project over
the course of more than five years since that first collaborators'
meeting. It seemed like a winner . . . but then the box office just
wouldn't get in step with our expectations. After all our work and
careful planning, shock was setting in.
</P>
<P>
   Hindsight, as the saying goes, is 20/20. Now I and others can
point to the lack of saturation advertising before the show's
opening and to the absence of a well-financed contingency plan to
respond to any unforeseen public-perception problems. We had gotten
great reviews and excellent word of mouth. Going by conventional
wisdom, this would have been enough. But too many potential
theatergoers had the misconceived notion that our show was an
unpleasant evening about freaks. We had failed to communicate that
``Side Show'' was an inspirational love story, a rags-to-riches
story. Anything but a downer.
</P>
<P>
   I am convinced that ``risky'' material won't necessarily doom a
show, but that not having a powerful advertising strategy will.
</P>
<P>
   As for the time I spent with Daisy and Violet, no regrets. They
taught me a lot, and to borrow a phrase from them, they will never
leave me. I recently attended a production of ``Side Show''
presented by TheaterWorks in Palo Alto, Calif, the show's first
production since Broadway. Again, excellent reviews and
enthusiastic audiences, and this time a sold-out box office (albeit
helped by the theater's subscription base). Could it be that our
envelope-pushing show still has a bright future? Maybe there's life
in the old girls yet.

PANEL AWARDS TEXAS LAWYERS $3.3 BILLION IN TOBACCO CASE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A yearlong controversy over tobacco legal fees
came to a head with a $3.3 billion payday for five private law
firms that helped Attorney General Dan Morales win Texas' $17.3
billion settlement from cigarette makers.
</P>
<P>
   The award by a national arbitration panel is larger than the
$2.6 billion award approved for the lawyers earlier this year by a
federal judge.
</P>
<P>
   But Morales said the decision, reached Thursday night in
Washington, should guarantee that the state won't have to pay the
main team of outside lawyers because the tobacco industry has
agreed to pay the fees set by the arbitrators.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't immediately known, however, how the arbitrators'
action would affect another outside lawyer, a friend of Morales who
had a separate arrangement with the attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   That attorney, Marc Murr of Houston, was paid $1 million by the
national arbitrators. But he has a $260 million fee award set by a
separate state arbitration panel _ not payable by the tobacco
industry _ that he could ask a federal court to enforce and order
the state to pay.
</P>
<P>
   That would surely prompt Gov. George W. Bush to attempt to
intervene. He has been an outspoken critic of the attorneys' fees
in the tobacco case.
</P>
<P>
   Morales has called Murr's role in the tobacco suit ``critical''
and said he does not think he was adequately paid. But other
lawyers in the case said he did little, if any, work. Murr did not
return phone calls from the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Morales called the $3.3 billion award ``fair and reasonable''
for the five law firms headed by Walter Umphrey and Wayne Reaud of
Beaumont, John O'Quinn and John Eddie Williams of Houston, and
Harold Nix of Daingerfield. O'Quinn is currently the center of a
disbarment trial accusing him of unethical solicitation of clients
after a plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who led a fight against Morales over the tobacco legal
fees earlier this year, said he ``will never understand &UR; '' &LR;  why
private law firms should collect $3.3 billion ``for working less
than two years on a case that was settled before it went to
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The fee seems totally out of proportion for the work
performed,'' he said, and vowed to fight any attempt by lawyers in
the tobacco case to get any part of their fees from Texas
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General-elect John Cornyn, who also has fought the
legal fees and will succeed Morales on Jan. 1, said he will
investigate the contingency contract with the five law firms and
look into Murr's involvement in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement, the main five lawyers said the
arbitrators' award ``will not reduce the payments the state will
receive under the settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   They noted that when the Texas lawsuit over smoking-related
health care costs and tobacco marketing practices was filed in
March 1996 ``no one predicted the state would recover a dime from
the (tobacco) industry. This industry had never paid anything in
its 40-year history of litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tobacco industry was finally held responsible,'' they
said. ``The citizens of Texas can stand tall in their victory over
the tobacco industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers said the three national arbitrators, who included
Texas Tech Law School Dean Frank Newton, set a base fee of 10
percent of the state's $17.3 billion settlement. Then the panel
increased that by a so-called ``difficulty'' factor to take into
account Texas' ``contributions as pioneers in tobacco litigation
and the tremendous results we obtained.''
</P>
<P>
   That put the award at about 19 percent of the Texas settlement.
A contingency agreement the five lawyers signed with Morales when
the anti-tobacco suit was filed guaranteed them only 15 percent of
whatever damages the state won or negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette companies will limit their payments to lawyers
representing Texas and other states involved in anti-tobacco
litigation to $500 million a year. Since most states have now
reached settlements with the industry, it will be an undetermined
number of years before the lawyers are paid in full.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco company Brown &AMP; Williamson said the awards are obscene
and shouldn't be viewed as a precedent for awards to the rest of
the states.
</P>
<P>
   If five lawyers alone were to share the $3.3 billion award, it
would compute to about $120,000 to $150,000 an hour, based on
fulltime work during the nearly two years that elapsed between the
time the anti-tobacco suit was filed and the settlement was
announced last January.
</P>
<P>
   But as many as 120 lawyers may share in the award, including
other members of the five firms, a spokesman for the lawyers said.
And part of the award _ an amount not disclosed _ will go to Ron
Motley, an anti-tobacco specialist from South Carolina who
participated in the Texas case.
</P>
<P>
   Civil justice reform groups immediately fired broadsides at the
award.
</P>
<P>
   John Butler, chairman of Texans for Reasonable Legal Fees, a
Houston-based group, said the size of the award ``shocks common
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Arbitrators also set fees for attorneys in Mississippi and
Florida, the only two states to settle anti-tobacco suits before
Texas. The private lawyers in Florida, which settled with cigarette
makers for $13.2 billion, were awarded $3.4 billion, or a 26
percent contingency fee, and lawyers in Mississippi, which settled
for $4.1 billion, got $1.4 billion or 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The contingency percentages for the lawyers in those states were
higher than those for the Texas team because of a greater
``difficulty'' factor.
</P>
<P>
   Brown and Williamson was not pleased. ``When we reached a
settlement with each of these three states, we agreed to pay
`reasonable compensation' to the lawyers representing the states.
The award of $8.1 billion defies anyone's definition of
`reasonable,''' the company said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A careworn President Clinton once more expressed
regret for the actions that have brought him to the brink of
impeachment and, for the first time in public, invited Congress to
censure him. But on Capitol Hill, the Republican leadership
rejected pleas for a vote on a resolution of presidential censure,
insisting that he must face a floor vote on articles of impeachment
approved by the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton walked slowly from the Oval Office to the Rose Garden at
4:11 p.m. Friday to acknowledge his shame and to state his
willingness to accept the rebuke and censure of Congress for his
``errors of word and deed.''
</P>
<P>
   His face lined with apparent anguish, the president spoke for
four minutes, apologizing for the torment to which he has subjected
his family and the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mere words cannot fully express the profound remorse I feel
for what our country is going through, and for what members of both
parties in Congress are now forced to deal with,'' Clinton said.
``These past months have been a tortuous process of coming to terms
with what I did. I understand that accountability demands
consequences, and I'm prepared to accept them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Painful though the condemnation of the Congress would be, it
would pale in comparison to the consequences of the pain I have
caused my family. There is no greater agony,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   He refused to respond to questions shouted by reporters after he
finished speaking and strode silently back through the West Wing
colonnade to his office.
</P>
<P>
   He had spoken as the Judiciary Committee prepared to vote on the
first article of impeachment. Many panel members had left the
hearing room to watch his remarks on televisions in staff offices,
but they returned quickly to begin casting their votes.
</P>
<P>
   Nine minutes after his remarks concluded, the Judiciary
Committee began the roll call on the first of four articles of
impeachment, accusing him of false statements under oath before a
federal grand jury hearing testimony on the Monica Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's words were designed to address calls from members of
both parties in Congress that he forthrightly confess his sins and
apologize in unambiguous language. But rather than admit to the
essence of the charges against him _ perjury, obstruction of
justice, abuse of power _ Clinton left the explanation for his
actions to his lawyers, who spent two days before the Judiciary
Committee this week making his case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Others are presenting my defense on the facts, the law and the
Constitution,'' Clinton said. ``Nothing I can say now can add to
that.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``What I want the American people to know, what I
want the Congress to know, is that I am profoundly sorry for all I
have done wrong in words and deeds. I never should have misled the
country, the Congress, my friends or my family. Quite simply, I
gave in to my shame.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's remarks, largely a new formulation of earlier
regrets, fell short of what many in Congress were demanding and
failed to sway any minds, judging by their comments after he spoke.
He may even have hurt his case with some members who wanted an
unqualified confession.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Franks, a moderate Republican from New Jersey, said
before the president spoke that he was waiting to hear what the
president would say before deciding how to vote on impeachment.
Franks, who is not a member of the Judiciary Committee, said after
Clinton spoke that he was disappointed that the president had not
admitted breaking the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was needed from the president today was an admission, not
contrition,'' Franks said in a statement. ``The House Judiciary
Committee has laid out a compelling case that the president
committed perjury. Unless the president comes forward soon and
admits his guilt, I am prepared to vote for articles of impeachment
charging him with perjury.''
</P>
<P>
   But a Democratic opponent of impeachment said that the president
had accomplished one critical task that could help persuade members
that censure, rather than impeachment and removal from office, was
the appropriate penalty for his conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``He put to rest that he is treating this proceeding in a
cavalier manner,'' said Rep. Rick Boucher, D-Va., a member of the
Judiciary panel. ``The sincerity was clear. It is obvious the
president understands he has behaved wrongfully and will suffer the
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton weighed for several days whether to talk to Congress and
the public about the impeachment votes, deciding only this
afternoon that he would speak. He rejected suggestions from some
underlings that he go further in confessing misconduct. His lawyers
have consistently refused to admit that the president lied under
oath or broke other laws, fearing it would make him liable to
criminal prosecution after he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   A senior White House official said that those who are demanding
that Clinton admit to illegal acts have already decided to vote for
impeachment. Such an admission would not only subject him to legal
jeopardy but would be politically futile, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The president reviewed his comments with John Podesta, White
House chief of staff, and with Gregory Craig, special counsel who
is coordinating the president's impeachment defense, just before
facing the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   The president departs for the Middle East early Saturday morning
and wanted to address the matter before leaving Washington for the
four-day journey, according to aides.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to do it before the trip so it won't bedevil him
while he is in Israel,'' said one senior White House official. ``He
is just loath to talk about it on foreign soil.''
</P>
<P>
   The aide said the president did not expect immediately to change
any impeachment votes with his remarks. But he hoped to ``freeze''
opinion while he was gone, leaving open the option of a second,
more forceful appeal to undecided members of Congress when he
returns late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The House is scheduled to begin debate on the Judiciary
Committee impeachment report on Thursday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Near the end of his remarks, Clinton cited four lines from
Edward FitzGerald's translation of ``The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam''
as capturing his regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ```The moving finger writes and, having write, moves on. Nor all
your piety nor wit shall lure it back to cancel half a line, nor
all your tears wash out a word of it,''' the president read.
</P>
<P>
   ``So nothing _ not piety, nor tears, nor wit, nor torment _ can
alter what I have done. I must make my peace with that,'' Clinton
said with a bite of his lower lip and a note of resignation. ``I
must also be at peace with the fact that the public consequences of
my actions are in the hands of the American people and their
representatives in Congress,'' Clinton added. ``Should they
determine that my errors of word and deed require their rebuke and
censure, I am ready to accept that.''

KENNETH BRUGGER, DISCOVERED MONARCHS' WINTER LAIR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Wis.)  (rl) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kenneth C. Brugger, a self-effacing amateur naturalist who made
an unforgettable discovery, died on Nov. 25 at his home in Austin,
Texas. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   If the Purepecha Indians of central Mexico had been a shade less
sophisticated, they might have regarded him as a god, and not
because the man from Kenosha, Wis., who appeared in their remote
mountaintop villages in 1975 was a brilliant textile engineer whose
proudest achievement was his work in perfecting the unshrinkable
undershirt.
</P>
<P>
   It was because he solved an ancient mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Brugger had long been lionized by lepidopterists in the United
States and Canada as the discoverer of the wooded mountain slopes
in Mexico where hundreds of millions of North American monarch
butterflies spend the winter.
</P>
<P>
   But to the Indians, who already knew that, Brugger was the man
who brought the news of where their beloved monarchs fly off to in
the spring: virtually the entire eastern United States and the
eastern regions of southern Canada.
</P>
<P>
   From either perspective, Brugger's was a transforming discovery,
one that settled an issue that had been puzzling scientists for
generations, that touched off a stampede of butterfly lovers and
that transformed the Indian culture. Their mountain homeland, 80
miles southwest of Mexico City, was turned into a tourist
attraction. And this created a campaign to protect the monarchs'
sanctuaries from loggers and other modern encroachments.
</P>
<P>
   For Brugger, a modest man who talked little about his
achievements, the discovery of the monarch butterfly's winter home
was a satisfying twist to a life of intellectual adventure.
</P>
<P>
   A man whose mechanical aptitude and mathematical brilliance
surfaced early in his life, Brugger, who never obtained a college
degree, worked as a mechanic in his father's garage until World War
II. Then the Army saw his test scores and assigned him to the
Signal Corps at Fort Monmouth, N.J., where he worked in
cryptography and developed a lifelong interest in homing pigeons;
at his death he had 13 birds.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to Kenosha after the war, Brugger went to work as a
junior supervisor for Jockey International. By the time a divorce
led him to pull up stakes in 1965 and start a new life as a textile
consultant in Mexico City, he had risen to chief engineer for
Jockey's worldwide knitting operations, designing, installing and
tinkering with innovative textile machines. Among them was the
compactor, which compresses cotton fibers so much that when they
spring back in the wash it compensates for the inevitable
shrinkage.
</P>
<P>
   Rugger's achievements may have been limited to underwear if he
had not picked up a Mexican newspaper one day in 1973 and seen an
advertisement placed by Fred Urquhart, a University of Toronto
scientist who was seeking volunteers to help him track the annual
migration of monarchs.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1940, when he began the project, Urquhart had enlisted
3,000 volunteers who had systematically tagged thousands of
butterflies, faithfully reported sightings of their annual flights
south, and learned much about the world's only insect migration _
one that is especially remarkable because the monarchs that swarm
out of Mexico in the spring are not the ones who return in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   In a sustained and unparalleled sexual frenzy, monarchs mate
themselves into oblivion in a matter of weeks, and it is generally
their great-grandchildren or great-great-grandchildren, hatched out
on milkweed leaves from Texas to Canada, that make the return trip
for what turns out to be a lazy, celibate winter, an abstinence
that allows them to live long enough to begin the flight back north
the next spring.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing Urquhart had not learned is exactly where the
monarchs spend the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling that he had once driven through a sudden storm of
monarch butterflies during a trip through the volcanic mountains
west of Mexico City, Brugger wrote to Urquhart and was persuaded to
return to the area to search for them.
</P>
<P>
   And that is how it happened that on Jan. 2, 1975, a date that
lepidopterists hold dear, Brugger and his wife, Catalina, made
their way through a forest of Oyamel firs until they reached the
10,000-foot level and suddenly realized that the trees were covered
with monarchs, as many as four million an acre, according to later
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   As thousands of ecstatic tourists have since discovered, the
massed orange and black monarchs make a breathtakingly beautiful
sight.
</P>
<P>
   It was a beauty that was largely lost on Brugger, who is
survived by three children, Carl, of Racine, Wis., Katharine
Carroll of Kenosha, and Kenneth Jr., of Austin; a brother, Robert,
of Kenosha; three grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   A man who once came home with a new sports jacket with an orange
stripe he thought was green, Brugger was totally colorblind _ he
saw the monarchs as shades of gray.

HANUKKAH BRINGS RENEWED TALK OF JEWISH IDENTITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By PETER STEINFELS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The title of the program was provocative: ``How
Jewish Do I Want to Be?'' And the timing was deliberate: one week
before Hanukkah.
</P>
<P>
   The afternoon of panel discussions and small-group conversations
at the Jewish Theological Seminary in Manhattan last Sunday took up
a major theme of the eight-day celebration, which begins Saturday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   That theme is, of course, resistance to assimilation, since
Hanukkah celebrates the Maccabees' victory, in 165 B.C., over the
foreign Hellenizing regime of Antiochus Epiphanes.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since a 1990 study showed that the intermarriage rate among
Jews had recently gone over 50 percent and that many younger Jews
were staying aloof from organized Jewish life, American Jews have
been immersed in discussions of ``Jewish continuity.''
</P>
<P>
   That study has provoked a ``profound reorientation'' for Jewish
organizations, John Ruskay, chief operating officer of the
UJA-Federation of New York, said at Sunday's gathering. They have
shifted from an ``external agenda'' of combating anti-Semitism and
mobilizing support for Israel to an ``internal agenda'' of
confronting ``the full challenge of emancipation.''
</P>
<P>
   He summed up that challenge with the dictum that ``it is no
longer rape that threatens us but seduction.''
</P>
<P>
   In giving word of Sunday's program, a helpful aide at the Jewish
Theological Seminary noted the topic's relevance to the well-known
``December dilemma'': the strain felt by intermarried Jews and
Christians, whose families are tugged between rival religious
observances, or simply the sense of not belonging felt by many Jews
amid the vast Christmas glitter and hubbub.
</P>
<P>
   But there was virtually no mention of the ``December dilemma''
during Sunday's discussions, which drew some 200 participants. More
surprising, for each reference to an intermarriage between a Jew
and a gentile there were many more references to ``intermarriages''
between Jewish spouses whose attitudes toward Jewishness and
Judaism were strikingly different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a cultural Jew married to a spiritual Jew,'' went one
instance of such testimony. ``I do things that please him and don't
offend me.''
</P>
<P>
   Another woman described her husband as a ``sentimental Jew'' who
spoke Yiddish and considered this more than sufficient for a Jewish
identity. In searching for a more religious Jewish identity, she
was on her own.
</P>
<P>
   If one of the day's small-group discussions was any guide, the
spiritual rivals to Judaism were far more likely to be Asian
traditions like Buddhism or yoga than Christianity. No one
mentioned the lure of Jesus or his Gospel; the leading stumbling
blocks to Jewish identity appeared to be basic questions about God
and prayer on the one hand and dissatisfaction with Jewish
institutions on the other.
</P>
<P>
   David Roskies, a professor of Jewish literature at the seminary,
which has long been the scholarly center of Conservative Judaism,
eloquently described the lifelong ``art of becoming a Jew'' in
modernity as a process of rebellion, loss, reclamation and
renegotiation.
</P>
<P>
   That much of this negotiation must occur within the group rather
than with the surrounding society was dramatized when the moderator
of a panel of Jewish authors asked whether, in their writings or
their personal lives, they had ever felt under pressure to disguise
or de-emphasize their Jewish identity.
</P>
<P>
   The only instance volunteered came from Nessa Rapoport, an
editor, novelist and poet. And it was surely an ironic one.
</P>
<P>
   She recalled being in Berkeley, Calif., for a conference of
Jewish writers from the United States and Israel. Being fluent in
Hebrew, she was guiding the Israelis, who like the majority of
Israeli Jews were distinctly secular in their outlook, around
Berkeley on a Friday when she realized that it would soon be sunset
and the Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   She wanted to return to her hotel and divest herself of money
she was carrying and make last-minute phone calls, activities
prohibited by traditional standards once the Sabbath began.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not find myself able to tell them I had to get to the
hotel because I was observant,'' Ms. Rapoport said. In the minds of
the Israeli visitors, she felt certain ``it would typecast me'' and
block effective communication with them at the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Her story only underlined what other groups anxious about
defining and maintaining their distinctive identities _ whether
Catholic, Muslim, Mormon or mainline Protestant _ could also
remember, to their advantage: It is a gross simplification to
imagine the struggle to claim and maintain a distinct identity as
the resistance of an undifferentiated ``us'' to an undifferentiated
``them.''
</P>
<P>
   Both worlds, although they can seem like a simple inside and a
simple outside, are more likely to be complex and intricately
interwoven. Sometimes it's enough to make one long for the days of
Antiochus Epiphanes.

WHAT THE CARDS REALLY SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday Dec. 13)  
(JT) 
 By MONIQUE P. YAZIGI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As if it's not stressful enough that people are
judged by their looks, their jobs and their addresses and even
where their children go to school, with the holidays approaching
there is one more item to add to the list: Christmas and Hanukkah
cards.
</P>
<P>
   What you send, when you send it, even what stamp you use _ all
have a dispiriting tendency to come under scrutiny. Do you enclose
a family picture? How about a letter boasting of your year's
events? Whatever choices you make, understand that the ritual of
keeping in touch at year's end has become competitive, one more
measure by which acquaintances and even friends and family will
measure your status.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a picture of my brother and his tacky new wife,'' one
Manhattan businessman said about the card sent by a middle-aged
sibling and his second wife, who was wearing angel wings. Not
wanting to cause a family uprising, he spoke on condition of
anonymity. He added: ``They think they're social. They look
ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor Stein, a real estate agent in her late 20s who lives on
the Upper East Side, was addressing her cards last Thursday night.
``I'm getting a stomachache over sending them out,'' she said. ``I
am so nervous about what people will think.'' Ms. Stein's card has
a picture of herself dressed as Hillary Rodham Clinton on it. ``I
wanted to be Pamela Anderson, but my father wanted me to change my
image,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At Smythson of Bond Street, which supplies stationery to the
British royal family, and to well-heeled New Yorkers from its
showroom on Third Avenue near 29th Street, customers typically
agonize for as long as three hours in choosing among the very
simple engraved cards. The cards, recognizable by the Smythson name
embossed on the left shoulder of the envelope, start at $385 for a
box of 100.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1984 edition of her etiquette book, Emily Post said that
engraved Christmas cards should be sent only by people who are
prominent in public life (Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis favored
Smythson writing paper). But now their appeal has spread widely.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely the busiest season we've ever had,'' said Ann
Patron, Smythson's president in the United States. ``People are
ordering more cards than before and asking for traditional
Christmas cards with a Santa Claus or wreath. People who ordered
150 last year ordered 400.''
</P>
<P>
   She speculated that her clients were sending expensive cards
instead of gifts, which would fit in with an overall trend in
holiday spending: in a nerve-racking year for the stock market,
consumers are looking for the aura of luxury without paying too
high a price.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, engraved cards at $3 to $4.50 apiece are selling out
at Tiffany and Cartier, spokeswomen for the stores say.
</P>
<P>
   But those tempted to indulge might want to remember that the
first thing many recipients will do is to peruse the cards to see
if they come from William Arthur or Mrs. John L. Strong, the
old-line stationers that were once purveyors to ``the 400.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think engraved stationery is beautiful if it comes to you
naturally and you were born and raised with it,'' said Marjorie
Gubelmann, a venture capitalist, who was (she divides her time
between Palm Beach and New York). ``But if you're doing it to
one-up the Joneses, it's not appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   In Palm Beach, one custom is to send cards with a picture of
oneself standing in front of the tree pasted on the front. ``It's
all to show their latest face lift and how young they look at 75,''
Ms. Gubelmann said. Another custom of the natives: engraving on the
cards the names of their pets _ ``Bugsy, Boo-Boo and Bebe,'' as Ms.
Gubelmann put it.
</P>
<P>
   Among many families, particularly in the suburbs, the custom is
to send pictures of children (but not adults) in a card with a
cutout frame or on cards supplied by a photo processor.
</P>
<P>
   But even that simple ritual has become competitive. Lately,
studied casualness seems to be in vogue, using unposed pictures of
the children on vacation, for example. The beach on Nantucket is
big this year, the message being ``We're not pretentious, but we do
take a nice family vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   Courtenay Khoury, who lives in Darien, Conn., and sends out 150
cards with unposed pictures of her two children, Virginia and
Philip, says she doesn't take the ritual too seriously. ``It's a
chance to keep in touch with those people you never talk to,'' she
said. ``You send a few words. It's like it keeps you up to date.
You're still alive, and this is what the children look like.''
</P>
<P>
   But for some of her neighbors, there may be more at stake, and
black-and-white, not color, photos are in vogue: ``Some think that
just shows you're a cut above the standard colored picture. It
gives it an artsy twist. When I receive a black-and-white from
someone, I say, `Uh oh, they switched over.'''
</P>
<P>
   But for Dr. Leonard LaManna and his wife, Renee, who live in Bay
Ridge, Brooklyn, and who sent a black-and-white photo of their two
children, they simply thought the old-fashioned picture looked
better than a color version, and they wanted their card to be
different from everyone else's.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's a photograph or simply a card, it's all big
business and getting bigger. Americans will send 2.6 billion cards
this holiday season, a number that is up significantly from last
year, said Marianne McDermott, the executive vice president of the
Greeting Card Association, a trade group in Washington. If the
average card costs $2, the total spent on holiday cards is about
$5.2 million, the association says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've added more types of cards, and more and more ethnic
cards are appearing like Kwanzaa,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible explanation is that card buyers are warming up
for the millennium, sure to be a bonanza for card-sending. At
Kate's Paperie in SoHo, a sellout this year was a card that reads
like a mathematical equation: ``2000 - 1 (EQ) 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   And at Kate's three branches in Manhattan, ``sales are up 30
percent from last year,'' Violet Brandwein, the merchandise
manager, said, adding, ``It's unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   For Joan Scribner, a professional ice skater in her 70s, whose
late husband, Charles Scribner Jr., used to run the Scribner
publishing house, Christmas still makes her feel like a little
girl. Mrs. Scribner, who plans to skate in the Holiday on the
Hudson ice show this month at Chelsea Piers, sends out 200 cards
every year. Her only prerequisite: The cards must have an ice
skater on the front. Where does she get them? Hallmark.

   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ The first of two NASA science probes
embarked Friday on a 416-million-mile voyage to Mars, catapulted
from Earth by a Boeing Delta 2 rocket.
</P>
<P>
   The spacecraft, called Mars Climate Orbiter, is programmed to
make the first full-scale study of Martian weather. It should
settle into a Mars orbit 260 miles above the planet in September,
followed closely by a companion spacecraft, Mars Polar Lander,
which is scheduled to be launched on Jan. 3 atop an identical Delta
2 rocket.
</P>
<P>
   Their $356 million mission: Find water.
</P>
<P>
   The orbiter was to have been launched on Thursday, but engineers
needed a day to solve an on-board computer software problem that
was discovered in a routine pre-flight test.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have acquired the spacecraft signal,'' Bruce Buckingham, a
space agency spokesman, said when the probe escaped Earth's gravity
about 50 minutes after it was launched at 1:56 p.m. from the
Kennedy Space Center here. ``Climate Orbiter is on its way to the
red planet.''
</P>
<P>
   The orbiter is the third in a series of nine probes to be
launched by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
through 2005, with the goal of returning a sample of Martian soil
to Earth. The first two probes, Mars Global Surveyor and Mars
Pathfinder, which carried a rock-exploring rover, arrived on Mars
last year. NASA tentatively plans eight dual-spacecraft missions
over the next 15 years to search for living organisms and to scout
suitable landing sites for a human expedition.
</P>
<P>
   Together, Mars Climate Orbiter and Mars Polar Lander will look
for water in the Martian soil and atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to look for life, either fossilized life or extant
life, on another planet, you have to follow the water,'' said
Edward Weiler, NASA's associate administrator for space science.
``That's what these two missions are all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike earlier NASA probes, which gathered weather information
over limited regions of the planet, Mars Climate Orbiter will look
at the entire planet. The orbiter will track seasonal changes as
well as the movement of water vapor and dust, observing how
moisture evaporates from the ground and migrates through the air
for an entire Martian year _ 687 Earth days.
</P>
<P>
   Before it begins its work as a weather satellite, the orbiter
will act as a radio relay for Mars Polar Lander. The lander is
designed to parachute lightly to the Martian surface in December
1999 after releasing two basketball-sized probes that will
crash-land and drill beneath the surface near the planet's south
pole. The lander itself will use a robot arm to dig up soil and
measure its water content. For about three months _ longer, if it
is able _ the lander will beam images and data through the orbiter
back to Earth.

BLAKE LIKELY TO PLAY

   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Barring a last-minute change of plans,
captain Rob Blake will return to the Los Angeles Kings' lineup
tonight, ending a disastrous 15-game absence during which the team
posted a 3-12 record.
</P>
<P>
   With Blake's return at 7 p.m. against Vancouver at the Forum,
the Kings will be as close to being whole as they have been all
season. Only three players remain injured, which qualifies as a
health boom for the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It solidifies our defense,'' Coach Larry Robinson said of
Blake's return from a broken foot. ``And it gives a bunch of
players who haven't had much confidence a little psychological
boost.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake is one of a number of significant Kings to be sidelined
for lengthy stretches this season. But with the returns of goalies
Stephane Fiset and Jamie Storr, No. 1 center Jozef Stumpel,
defenseman Doug Bodger and now Blake, Robinson will get his best
look this season at something resembling his entire team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty hard to judge our team,'' Blake said of the Kings
(7-17-3). ``We haven't had our full lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake is expected to receive full duty tonight, playing on
special teams as well as at even strength.
</P>
<P>
   Bure update (subhed)
</P>
<P>
   Disgruntled Vancouver star Pavel Bure, the subject of trade
rumors involving the Kings (among other teams), may be traded soon
by the Canucks, but it's uncertain where he'll be going.
</P>
<P>
   Canucks general manager Brian Burke was in Vancouver on Friday,
not in Los Angeles with his team. The New York Rangers, New York
Islanders and Kings are believed to be three of the leading
contenders to acquire Bure.
</P>
<P>
   Kings general manager Dave Taylor has declined comment on Bure.
But the Canucks are believed to desire a front-line center in any
deal for Bure, which would mean the Kings would have to give up
either Jozef Stumpel or Olli Jokinen, players they would be
reluctant to part with.
</P>
<P>
   Other possible deals involving Bure would be one that would
bring the Canucks a package of players from the Rangers, including
center Nicklas Sundstrom, or a deal with the Islanders for unsigned
winger Zigmund Palffy. The Canucks might then include Palffy in a
second trade for a center.
</P>
<P>
   __ Loose pucks: Mark Visheau, usually a defenseman, played right
wing during practice Friday on a line with Josh Green and Nathan
LaFayette. Robinson was uncertain whether he would use the
combination in tonight's game. He said it might hinge on the
availability of center Yanic Perreault, whose fiancee was in labor
Friday. ...Winger Steve McKenna (strained abdomen) was placed on
the injured-reserve list. ... Prospect Pavel Rosa, sidelined the
past month with symptoms of post-concussion syndrome, may start
skating soon. Rosa is assigned to the IHL's Long Beach Ice Dogs.
... Unsigned defenseman Aki Berg, who is playing in his native
Finland, has been chosen to play for his country in the Baltica
Cup, a tournament later this month in Moscow. Berg has six goals
and nine points in 22 games for his Finnish team.

POLITICAL COST OF MEXICAN BANK BAILOUT IS MOUNTING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Although at heart a bookish economist, Guillermo
Ortiz rose to become one of the most powerful people in Mexico and
as finance minister won acclaim for steering the country through
the fiscal equivalent of a category 5 hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is the center of a controversy that has brought Mexico's
young democracy to a high-risk impasse and severely tested the
ability of the country's Congress to resolve issues through the
dickering and deal-making of party politics.
</P>
<P>
   A major opposition group, the conservative National Action
Party, or PAN, has demanded that Ortiz resign as head of the Banco
de Mexico, the central bank.
</P>
<P>
   The party's lawmakers charge that as finance minister he
violated the Constitution in putting together a $61 billion
emergency program to rescue sinking banks during the economic
crisis of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The legislators argue that he should have obtained congressional
approval when he financed the bailout with government debt. Ortiz
responded that the program had been vetted by government legal
advisers before they were carried out and had been repeatedly
reviewed by Congress since then.
</P>
<P>
   President Ernesto Zedillo and his party, the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, closed ranks around Ortiz last week,
firmly if belatedly, saying he would not resign.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is Mexico's continued financial stability. The ups and
downs of the long bailout debate, which began in February, have
shaken the country's markets, left the banks in limbo and rattled
the nerves of international investors.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions have tied up the Congress for weeks, even
pushing aside deliberations about the 1999 federal budget, which
must be approved by Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although the fight over Ortiz is couched in high-toned legal
arguments, it is driven by plain old politics. The National Action
Party has drawn up an ambitious proposal to reorganize the bailout
program, which is believed by many taxpayers to have rescued
crooked bankers at public expense.
</P>
<P>
   To pass the proposal, the party's lawmakers have been forced
into an uneasy alliance with the governing party, which has the
largest delegation in the lower house of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But anxious to avoid appearing to voters as a handmaiden to a
government party they consider corrupt, the National Action Party
wants to exact a political price from Zedillo. It wants Ortiz's
head, and the party's legislators say they will not even vote for
their own bailout solution if they do not get it.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers' price is high indeed. If Zedillo lets Ortiz fall,
he will tacitly admit that he also was at fault in the bailout,
acknowledging an offense that would be impeachable were the
president not protected by the Constitution from prosecution while
in office.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Ortiz, who is admired on Wall Street for his
hard-headed approach, is the first official to start a full term as
head of the central bank since it was endowed with new independence
in 1994 in legislation written, interestingly enough, by the
National Action Party.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new law, the president must open an impeachment trial
against Ortiz to remove him, something he is not about to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is questioning my performance as head of the Banco de
Mexico,'' Ortiz said in an interview. ``This is not about me; it is
about preserving the autonomy of the central bank.''
</P>
<P>
   One official familiar with the president's thinking said:
``Losing Ortiz would send a terrible message of weakness. It would
signal the markets that the government bows to populist demands.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ortiz, who is 50, is an unlikely figure to provoke such a
dramatic standoff. Trained at Stanford University, he is an
economic pragmatist who never adopted the lordly manner of past
finance ministers.
</P>
<P>
   But his career has been clouded by spectacular scandals
involving Mexicans who bought banks from the government during a
privatization campaign in the early 1990s. Ortiz was chairman of
the committee that oversaw the sale of 18 banks.
</P>
<P>
   But three buyers _ Carlos Cabal Peniche, Angel Isidoro Rodriguez
Saez and Jorge Lankenau Rocha _ misused the banks so badly that
they now face criminal-fraud charges amounting to hundreds of
millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government doesn't want to admit its responsibility,''
said Gerardo Buganza, a National Action lawmaker. ``It is just
caprice on the part of President Zedillo to keep the man who did it
wrong the first time.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a passionate debate that was by turns solemn
with history, fiercely partisan and at times sorrowful, the House
Judiciary Committee voted along party lines Friday to impeach
President Clinton and remove him from office for perjury.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-controlled committee, voting 21 to 16, late
Friday afternoon charged Clinton in one article of impeachment with
providing ``perjurious, false and misleading testimony'' last Aug.
17 before a grand jury investigating the Monica Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, one Republican _ Rep. Lindsey O. Graham of
South Carolina _ broke with his party as the committee voted 20 to
17 to approve a second article of impeachment on perjury, this time
for Clinton's deposition in the Paula Corbin Jones sexual
harassment case. Graham had long said he would not support
impeachment for a lie in a civil case.
</P>
<P>
   So what began with a civil sex harassment suit by an obscure
Arkansas civil servant and was transformed into a criminal
investigation of sex and mendacity by the president, left Clinton
Friday as the third president to confront impeachment, with a House
vote scheduled for next week.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Johnson was spared removal from office by one vote in the
Senate after the House impeached him in 1868. Richard Nixon
resigned in disgrace in the Watergate scandal 24 years ago after
the Judiciary Committee approved three articles against him, but
before the House voted.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, the chairman, brought the
Judiciary Committee's ten-week inquiry towards a close, insisting
on the gravity of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the president performs the public act of asking God to
witness his promise to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, that is not trivial,'' the Illinois Republican said.
``Whether it's a civil suit or before the grand jury the
significance of the oath cannot or must not be cheapened if our
proud boast that we are a government of laws and not of men is to
mean anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself commented for the first time since the committee
began televised proceedings. Just minutes before the committee was
to take its first vote, the president walked into the Rose Garden
and spoke once again of his remorse for his affair with Ms.
Lewinsky. For the first time he publicly said he would accept a
rebuke or censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mere words cannot fully express the profound remorse I feel
for what our country is going through and for what members of both
parties in Congress are now forced to deal with,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These past months have been a torturous process of coming to
terms with what I did,'' he said. ``I understand that
accountability demands consequences and I'm prepared to accept
them. Painful though the condemnation of the Congress would be, it
would pale in comparison to the consequences of the pain I have
caused my family. There is no greater agony.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton stopped well short of the admission that some
undecided Republicans were looking for that he had in fact lied
under oath.
</P>
<P>
   At the Judiciary Committee, most members left the debate to
watch the president on television. Then, minutes later, in the same
cavernous hearing room where Nixon's fate was weighed 24 years ago,
they voted to approve the first article of impeachment and moved on
to the second.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is to vote by Saturday on articles of impeachment
accusing the president of obstruction of justice and abuse of
power.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats argued that Clinton had deceived the nation, but
said he did not deserve removal from office for lies about an
extra-marital affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wake up America'' implored Rep. Robert Wexler of Florida,
calling for the nation, which polls show overwhelmingly opposes
impeachment, to make its feelings known. ``They are about to
impeach our president. They are about to reverse two national
elections. They are about to discard your votes.''

HOUSTON DEMOCRAT APPEALS FOR CENSURE, NOT IMPEACHMENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As one of President Clinton's most ardent
defenders, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas has emerged as a
vociferous combatant on the Constitution, arguing that to impeach
the nation's chief executive for lying about sex would trample that
``sacred document.''
</P>
<P>
   In a last-minute appeal Friday to her Republican colleagues on
the House Judiciary Committee, Jackson Lee called it
``preposterous'' to consider his impeachment. She instead urged the
panel to adopt a resolution of censure, as the ``right, punitive
and just'' punishment for the president's conduct in the Monica
Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did our founding fathers have in mind individual personal
behavior when they described an impeachable offense? A re-reading
of the Constitution will suggest that they had no such triviality
in mind, but rather, major offenses against the state,'' the
congresswoman told her colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``What major ... offenses have been committed? How has the
unacceptable behavior of this chief executive brought severe damage
and harm to the nation? What actions have posed a threat to the
security of the nation and its position in world politics?'' she
asked.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Lee, one of 16 Democrats on the judiciary panel, has
taken the lead among her colleagues in pushing censure as an
alternative to impeachment. In remarks several weeks ago as the
committee was just beginning its impeachment inquiry, she first
raised the possibility of censure, not only as a way out of ``this
mess,'' as she put it then, but as possibly a worse punishment for
Clinton than an impeachment trial where he might be acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine a situation where the president of the United
States would have to endure a public reprimand in the House of
Representatives?'' she asked at the time, shaking her head. ``I
can't understand why that would not be an acceptable resolution of
this to my Republican colleagues ... rather than dragging the
country through a long impeachment process.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel's 21 Republicans instead voted through articles of
impeachment Friday. The House will meet in special session next
week for a vote as early as Thursday on the committee's final
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Although the committee is not likely to approve a resolution of
censure as a ``fallback position,'' as one committee aide put it,
that alternative could still be raised during the floor debate if
the Republican leadership allows it. If they do, it will likely be
the resolution authored by Jackson Lee and three of her colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   It acknowledges that Clinton made false statements about his
``reprehensible conduct'' with Lewinsky, took steps to delay the
independent counsel Kenneth Starr's investigation of the affair,
and should remain subject to criminal and civil penalties after he
leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   Committee member William Delahunt, D-Mass., called Jackson Lee
``a critical player in drafting'' a resolution that the Democrats
hope will appeal to enough moderate Republicans to head off a vote
by the full House on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all sat down and hammered out what we thought would be
language that was necessary and most acceptable,'' he said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In her appeal Friday, Jackson Lee said that censure would at
least allow ``the healing of the nation'' to begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us promote censure, not impeachment. For impeachment would
not be grounded in the Constitution and has not been proven beyond
a reasonable doubt,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead to the vote on the House floor next week, she
added: ``To those ... House members who are searching their souls
today, with censure you stamp this president's legacy forever, but
you maintain the stability of the institution of the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Lee, who represents the 18th congressional district , is
following in the footsteps of another black congresswoman from
Houston _ Barbara Jordan, who 24 years ago gained national
prominence as a member of the committee that drew up articles of
impeachment against President Nixon for his conduct in the
Watergate scandal. She is all too aware that her performance in the
present impeachment drama is likely to be compared to Jordan's.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't mind the comparison, especially when it comes to
defending the integrity of the Constitution as Jordan did so
eloquently during the Watergate proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Although Jackson Lee has delivered statements reminiscent of the
high oratory of Jordan, her remarks have often been closer to
street fighting. When Starr testified before the committee last
month, she seemed to delight in mixing it up with him. She once
referred to him as ``a ticking time bomb,'' determined to destroy
the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't deny that I am, and I will continue to be, persistent
in my ... insistence that this proceeding be fair to the president
and to the people of this country,'' she told a reporter recently
when asked if Clinton would be able to get an objective hearing
before the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Her battle against impeachment has not been easy for Republican
committee members to deal with, especially committee chairman Henry
Hyde, R-Ill., who has engaged in a number of parliamentary
wrestling matches with her.
</P>
<P>
   Although irritated by some of her interruptions in the committee
hearings, Hyde commended her persistence in a recent comment to a
reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wish she were on my side,'' he said, smiling.

REFERENDUM SUNDAY COULD SET STAGE FOR FINAL VOTE ON STATEHOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By MIREYA NAVARRO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico _ On a balmy evening this week, the
caravan of dozens of cars snaking around the working-class
neighborhoods of Carolina, a city east of here, brought its
deafening honking, sirens, music and shouts of ``Equality for
Puerto Rico!'' right to Jose Manuel Molina's doorstep. Molina, 65,
and his wife, Blanca, 61, rushed out of the house and began
hollering, in delight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Number 3! Number 3!'' they yelled, referring to a
pro-statehood ballot measure that is one of five options in a
referendum Sunday on Puerto Rico's political status.
</P>
<P>
   In decades of voting for the pro-statehood party, Molina said,
this is the first time he feels Puerto Rico has a real possibility
of joining the union as a state.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not for us but for our youth and our children,'' said
the retired telephone repairman, who has three children and 15
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is for them,'' Mrs. Molina agreed. ``It will bring better
jobs and schools. We'll learn more languages. There will be
stricter laws, more order.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's vote, the subject of heated campaigning that ended
Friday with big rallies in the San Juan metropolitan area, is a bid
by the administration of Gov. Pedro Rossello to measure the
island's support for statehood and prod Congress into authorizing a
future binding vote on statehood here.
</P>
<P>
   The House this year passed a bill that would have allowed a
federally sponsored referendum on Puerto Rico's status this year,
which marks the 100th anniversary of the U.S. takeover of the
island from Spain after the Spanish-American War. But the proposal
stalled in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress and Clinton administration officials say the
results of Sunday's vote would be viewed as a serious indication of
which political status option Puerto Ricans prefer _ independence,
statehood or some other form of association with the United States.
The vote is likely to start a new legislative process in Washington
to seek a final status choice.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Ricans remain at odds over whether to cement their ties
with the United States with statehood or to seek more autonomy, but
most are united in holding on to three elements of their identity _
Spanish language, Latin American culture and U.S. citizenship.
Congress, in turn, is sharply divided over whether to accept Puerto
Rico as a possible state, and previous bills on self-determination
have bogged down on questions about the political, cultural and
economic cost of incorporating an island with 3.8 million Latin
Americans as the 51st state.
</P>
<P>
   But a consensus is growing in Washington that Puerto Rico's
current commonwealth status is a transitional state. Opponents call
it a vestige of colonialism and even supporters want to give the
island more self-governing powers.
</P>
<P>
   The commonwealth or ``free associated state'' created in 1952
gives Puerto Ricans U.S. citizenship but denies them equal rights
and obligations. It grants the island self-government in local
affairs and subjects it to federal law, like states. But unlike
residents in the states, including Puerto Ricans who live on the
mainland, Puerto Ricans on the island do not pay federal taxes,
cannot vote on federal elections, and do not receive federal
benefits comparable to those available on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Those who advocate a 51st state say commonwealth status denies
full rights to Puerto Ricans even though they are U.S. citizens.
The governing pro-statehood New Progressive Party has crafted the
ballot measure as a petition to the U.S. government under the First
Amendment ``to define in a conclusive manner the political
condition of the people of Puerto Rico and the extent of United
States sovereignty in order to resolve the current territorial
problem of the island'' after ``100 years of political
subordination.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Puerto Rican political analysts say such language amounts
to an exercise of the constitutional right to petition the federal
government for the redress of grievances, in this case the
grievance of colonialism, that gives the vote more weight and is
meant to prompt a federal response.
</P>
<P>
   Rossello said in an interview Friday that, legally, Congress
cannot be forced to take action but ``certainly it will be a strong
statement that I don't think Congress can ignore.''
</P>
<P>
   With five options on the ballot, however, newspaper polls here
indicate that none is likely to get a majority. The vote is further
complicated by an option called ``none of the above,'' which is
supported by commonwealth supporters as a form of protest against
the referendum.
</P>
<P>
   The leadership of the pro-commonwealth Popular Democratic Party
argues that the definition of the status quo as drafted by the
pro-statehood majority in the legislature and as it appears on the
ballot is misleading. It calls U.S. citizenship ``statutory''
rather than irrevocable and inviolable as in two previous
plebiscite votes, for instance, in order to scare Puerto Ricans
into voting for statehood, the party says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a process of self-determination because there are many
perspectives,'' said Mayor Sila Calderon of San Juan, a leader of
the Popular Democrats, ``but this is not fair and square.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to commonwealth, statehood, independence and none of
the above, the ballot includes a ``free association'' option
appearing for the first time on a status referendum. It calls for a
self-governing nation that delegates certain powers to the United
States under treaties, like defense and national security. The
relationship would be similar to the arrangement the United States
has with Pacific territories like the Marshall Islands, federal
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   It is uncertain what Sunday's plebiscite vote will do to advance
the cause of self-determination for the island with a Congress
divided over whether to open up the opportunity for Puerto Rico to
join the union. Rossello said he would consider a plurality of the
vote a victory and enough of a mandate to take to Congress to start
a transition plan to implement statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill approved by the House this year, such a
transition would take no longer than 10 years and require another
referendum for final approval.
</P>
<P>
   If statehood wins, it would be the first time that such an
option garners the most votes in Puerto Rico. In a 1993 referendum,
statehood lost to commonwealth 46 percent to 48 percent. The third
option, independence, got 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of Congress have said a plurality could suffice to
start a process for Congress to define the terms of a yes-or-no
vote on statehood. Florida's senators, Republican Connie Mack and
Democrat Bob Graham, said in a joint statement that they would act
to implement the option chosen by a majority but would disregard
the ``none of the above votes'' because ``such a vote conveys no
message to the federal government.'' That may leave statehood with
a clear majority among only four options instead of five.

WASHINGTON: your votes.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The president's chances of avoiding trial in the Senate _ where
his opponents are exceedingly unlikely to get the 67 votes needed
for conviction _ rest with a few dozen Republican moderates. The
vote in the House, which is to return on Thursday, is considered
too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   Because the stakes are so high, both parties in the House were
prepared to take extraordinary steps to bring back members,
including carrying one California congressman recuperating from
surgery to Washington on an air ambulance if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that Clinton is not making headway, six previously
undeclared Republicans _ Jack Metcalf of Washington, Saxby Chamblis
of Georgia, Lincoln Diaz-Balart of Florida, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of
Florida, Bob Franks of New Jersey and Rodney Frelinghuysen of New
Jersey _ came out in favor of impeachment or said they were leaning
that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was needed from the president today was an admission, not
contrition,'' Franks said after Clinton's statement.
</P>
<P>
   And a moderate Republican who has said he opposes impeachment,
Rep. Amo Houghton of New York, became the target of a conservative
Republican who said he would run against Houghton in 2000. Jim
Pierce said Houghton had ``betrayed'' conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend has not been in the direction of those who want to
avoid impeachment,'' said Rep. Charles E. Schumer, New York's new
senator-elect. ``Over the weekend Americans are going to realize
this is for real.''
</P>
<P>
   There was also a signal from the Senate Friday that it was
suddenly taking seriously the possibility that it could become the
jury in a trial of the president. The press secretaries of Trent
Lott, the majority leader from Mississippi, and Tom Daschle, the
minority leader from South Dakota, did something they rarely do _
put out a joint statement. All it said was that the two men would
make no comment until after the House acted.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost a year ago that the independent counsel, Kenneth
Starr, began investigating the president's relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky and whether he was trying to persuade her to commit
perjury in the Paula Jones case. The investigation plunged the
White House into a yearlong crisis that Clinton compounded when he
emphatically told the nation that he had not had sex ``with that
woman,'' Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months later Starr reported to Congress that he had
``substantial and credible evidence'' that Clinton had committed 11
possibly impeachable offenses in his effort to cover-up the affair.
</P>
<P>
   At the time Hyde said ``we all agree any impeachment cannot
succeed unless it is done in a bipartisan way.'' But on Friday he
defended his inquiry.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In time for this season of food and drink _ the average adult,
we are told, will gain seven pounds between Thanksgiving and New
Year's Day _ come two new tales of how we harvest the fruits of the
earth, and the vine, in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``With These Hands: The Hidden World of Migrant Farmworkers
Today,'' by Daniel Rothenberg (Harcourt Brace, $28) is a fresh, and
sobering, account of a familiar tale of poverty and policy
failures.
</P>
<P>
   Using interviews interspersed with analysis, the book captures
the lives of the 1.5 million people who work in the nation's fruit
and vegetable fields. Half of these laborers are migrants who
follow the harvest.
</P>
<P>
   And despite periodic exposes, union organizing drives,
legislation and national breast-beating, many of them are still
miserably housed (sometimes in chicken coops), cheated, threatened
and underpaid. Their average annual income is just $6,500.
</P>
<P>
   The author, a former legal-services worker in Florida, says
government folly and the farm-labor system itself are the culprits.
</P>
<P>
   As long as growers depend on an oversupply of immigrants and on
the unregulated contractors who round them up, he says, farm
workers will be marginalized. The migrants are powerless to
negotiate in such a fragmented system.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Rothenberg makes his case by letting people
talk. The book's vignettes are drawn from 250 interviews on front
porches, in border-patrol zones and labor camps, and on street
corners where migrants are recruited. The final product is a mosaic
of textured portraits, not a two-dimensional description of
downtrodden laborers and evil overseers.
</P>
<P>
   A Mexican man _ half of all migrant workers come from outside
the United States _ describes repeated nightmarish forays across
the border. Another worker speaks proudly of his ``fast hands'' in
the field.
</P>
<P>
   A homeless man recounts his escape from a ``debt peonage'' camp,
where, he said, he was sold food, wine and drugs in exchange for
his labor _ and was always on the minus side of the ledger.
</P>
<P>
   Contractors talk, too. ``Ninety-nine percent of all contractors
break the law,'' one says offhandedly. Growers, both sensitive and
callous, weigh in as well.
</P>
<P>
   And Border Patrol agents tell their stories. ``It's a complete
charade,'' one says about the revolving-door arrests that keep both
agents and smugglers busy.
</P>
<P>
   Rothenberg also traces the federal farm labor policies that have
helped and hurt workers. But he says he wrote the book to fight the
laborers' biggest foe: a continuing invisibility that precludes
reform.
</P>
<P>
   Their stories ``need to be heard,'' he says, ``their world
revealed, their lives recognized.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Much more upbeat, but less deft, is ``Harvest of Joy: My Passion
for Excellence'' by Robert Mondavi with Paul Chutkow (Harcourt
Brace, $27), a memoir by one of California's most successful
vintners.
</P>
<P>
   Now 85, Mondavi looks back at a time when the Napa Valley
catered mainly to the jug-wine market and when the Charles Krug
Winery, owned by his father, had only a handful of competitors,
like Beaulieu and Inglenook. He also tells the story of founding
his own winery in 1965 after running Krug for 23 years with his
brother, Peter.
</P>
<P>
   A trip abroad in 1962, he writes, opened his eyes to European
fine wine making, with its oak-cask aging and preference for small
batches and separate treatments for each variety of grape. It was a
far cry from the California mass-production practices of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Some bitter family arguments _ along with the desire to adopt
the European approach _ propelled his entrepreneurship and
sustained a years-long feud with his brother. Mondavi appears to be
candid about his own driving ambition and the ``tunnel vision''
that created serious rifts with his children and their mother, as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harvest of Joy'' gives a sense of Mondavi's important role in
building a new Napa Valley tradition of making European-style wines
and marketing them in a distinctly American way. For years, the
author promoted wine as part of a healthy Mediterranean-style
cuisine. He offered wine tastings and French cooking seminars at
his winery and traveled relentlessly to sell on the East Coast and
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The Robert Mondavi Winery became a huge success: It is now a
publicly traded company with joint ventures in Chile and France,
including Opus One, a winemaking partnership with the prestigious
Chateau Mouton, owned by the family of Baron Philippe de
Rothschild.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Mondavi's book is less successful than his
winery. In spite of interesting sections on wine making and the
history of the Napa Valley, the narrative, which often forsakes
chronology, is fragmented, cliched and repetitive.
</P>
<P>
   And the author succumbs to the lure of offering the dreaded
Business Lessons _ 15 of them _ in the concluding chapter.

OTTO FRANKEL, GENETICIST WHO WARNED OF THREATENED SPECIES, DIES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Australia)   (jw) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sir Otto Frankel, a plant geneticist who was among the first to
warn of the threat to whole species, died on Nov. 21 in Canberra,
Australia. He was 98.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s Frankel and a small band of scientists sounded the
alarm over the loss of species in agriculture, pointing to farming
regions and even individual fields that were undergoing rapid
changes in the intricate and vital interactions among millions of
species.
</P>
<P>
   From crops they cast their eyes on flora and fauna in general,
and the disappearance of species seemed foreboding. It was Frankel
and his colleagues who kept the issue of genetic resources alive
through the 1960s and '70s, well before the word biodiversity
entered the language.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke out at international conferences and wrote or edited
books defining the problems involved, and exploring solutions. His
address to the 1972 U.N. Conference on the Human Environment in
Stockholm drew widespread attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wild species must have available a pool of genetic diversity
if they are to survive environmental pressures exceeding the limits
of developmental plasticity,'' he once wrote. ``If this is not the
case, extinction would appear inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Otto Herzberg Frankel was born to affluence in Vienna. His
mother's family owned estates in Galicia (now in southeast Poland
and western Ukraine), where he discovered his interest in
agriculture. He attended universities in Vienna and Munich and
received his doctorate from the Agricultural University of Berlin.
In the late 1920s he worked as a plant breeder on a large estate in
Slovakia and in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand asked him to join its new Wheat Research Institute
in 1929 as a plant breeder and geneticist; he stayed there for 22
years, the final seven as chief executive. On trips back to Europe
he developed close ties with eminent geneticists like C.D.
Darlington and J.B.S. Haldane.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, Frankel became chief of the division of plant industry
for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research
Organization in Australia. He formally retired in 1966, but
returned to the plant division to resume his research.
</P>
<P>
   He was knighted in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   He continued to work, ski and fish, his favorite pastimes, until
he was 90. His last book, written with two colleagues, appeared
when he was 95; its U.S. edition is titled ``The Preservation of
Plant Biodiversity.''

THE IMPORTANCE OF INTERNSHIP  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 13) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ark., Calif., Ohio)   (af)  
 By MICHELLE COTTLE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. (italics)I am a business major with a concentration in
information systems. I hear that the job market is very good, but I
do not have internship experience. Should I graduate on schedule to
enter that market, or wait a year to complete an internship?(end
italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The world, it seems, is your employment oyster. Regardless of
whether you graduate next spring or stay in school another year,
experts say, you're unlikely to wind up flipping hamburgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even without internship experience, someone just getting out
of school with an information-technologies-related degree can
literally find a job in almost any part of the country with a very
good starting salary,'' said George S. Smith, vice president of
media services for Alltel, a telecommunications and information
technology company in Little Rock, Ark. ``These people are a very
hot commodity. Alltel basically has a standing offer: You come to
us and we'll hire you.''
</P>
<P>
   The competition for qualified employees is intense, Smith said,
noting that companies like his have had to resort to aggressive
recruiting tactics and offer tempting starting salaries. ``You
cannot find enough people to fill the jobs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   From the job seeker's point of view, however, it may be best to
stay in school for an internship _ if you can afford the time and
expense. That way, some career advisers say, you can maximize your
marketability to get the hottest job at the highest possible
salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dilemma new graduates most often face is that they've got
fine academic training, but no hard experience,'' said Betsy
Collard, director of programs at the Career Action Center in
Cupertino, Calif., in the heart of Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Internships can provide an important edge, she said. ``You'll be
able to demand more and get farther faster when you do graduate,''
she added. The training also helps build your comfort level with
the working world, reducing the chances of falling on your face
later.
</P>
<P>
   Career centers at universities often help match students and
employers, many of whom are eager for interns. ``I've heard several
companies say they cannot get all the interns they want in this
area,'' said Dan Lohmeyer, executive director of the IT Alliance,
an economic development group for the information technology
industry near Dayton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   But will the job market cool while you're slogging through that
extra year? ``These opportunities are not going to go away,'' Ms.
Collard said. ``The numbers in school with that area of
concentration don't compare with the growing need.''
</P>
<P>
   Lohmeyer agreed. ``Even when the Y2K problem gets solved, I
don't see any diminution of demand on the horizon,'' he said,
referring to the Year 2000 computer problem. ``Everywhere you turn,
people in business are folding information technologies into what
they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're talking about a wave here,'' he said of
these jobs. ``We're talking about a flood.'' &QL;

   Many Brake Lights On the Economic Road &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Signs abound that both the American and the global economies are
slowing.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve's ``beige book'' report on regional business
conditions around the country found growth slowing, exports
contracting and retail sales weakening in November in many areas.
</P>
<P>
   Warnings of softening overseas sales came from Union Carbide,
Coca-Cola and other companies, as did a clutch of reductions in
analysts' earnings forecasts for widely followed companies. J.P.
Morgan &AMP; Co. warned investors to expect sharply lower earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The number of planned job cuts by United States businesses rose
in November from a year earlier, putting the annual total on track
for the largest number of cuts in five years, according to the
monthly survey conducted by Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas, an
employment firm. Initial claims for unemployment insurance inched
up again.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Ericsson, the Swedish maker of cellular phones, said
that its profits were sagging and that it would lay off 10,000 more
workers.
</P>
<P>
   The difference in yield between long-and short-term Treasury
securities continued to narrow, a development often interpreted as
a harbinger of an economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   Britain cut interest rates for the third month running, this
time lowering its benchmark rate by half a percentage point; most
of the countries that will begin using the euro in January cut
rates last week.
</P>
<P>
   None of this seems to be snapping consumers' wallets shut.
Retail sales unexpectedly rose 0.6 percent in November, marking
four months in a row of robust growth and prompting analysts to
raise their forecasts for the holiday shopping season as a whole. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Commodity Deflation And Trade Angst &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the Labor Department reported on Friday that wholesale
prices fell in November, much of the reason could be found in a
continuing slump in commodity prices, especially for energy. Two
widely followed commodity indexes, compiled by Goldman, Sachs and
by the Commodity Research Bureau, hit their lowest levels in
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Other than precious metals, which were already deeply depressed
when 1998 began, every major commodity sector is off at least 16
percent for the year so far. Crude oil slipped below $11 a barrel,
with no end to the decline in sight even though OPEC countries
agreed to extend production curbs that were due to expire.
</P>
<P>
   Low prices are battering American steelmakers, which have
complained that distressed Asian competitors are dumping
underpriced steel in the United States and which are waging a
lobbying offensive in Washington, hoping for relief. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The giant Maersk-Sealand shipping alliance narrowed its list of
finalists for the East Coast terminal for its burgeoning fleet of
supersize container ships, which are too big for existing
facilities. The ports of New York and New Jersey; Baltimore, and
Halifax, Nova Scotia, remain in the running. Norfolk, Va., and
Quonset Point, R.I., have been dropped from contention. The winner
is expected to be chosen by year-end. ... The Better Business
Bureau told nuclear power companies not to say in advertising that
they are pollution-free. ... Undaunted by how often the merger
plans of big drug companies tend to collapse, the Zeneca Group of
Britain agreed to acquire Astra AB of Sweden for about $35 billion
in stock. ... Aetna announced a deal to acquire Prudential
Insurance's health insurance business. ... Cadbury Schweppes, based
in London, sold its non-United States soft-drink business to
Coca-Colaalready bold above so it could concentrate on competing
with Coke in America. ... In a long-anticipated management shakeup,
Gary C. Wendt resigned as head of General Electric's highly
profitable financial-services arm. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SO TO SPEAK &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Finer Points &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Considering that management consultants' livelihoods are
predicated on having valuable advice to offer clients, it can be
instructive to see what kind of advice they offer one another.
</P>
<P>
   The November-December issue of IMC Times, the newsletter of the
New York-based Institute of Management Consultants, serves up a
timely cover article on ``consultant etiquette.'' Pointers are
offered on what the newsletter calls ``tricky areas'' for
consultants: entertaining (``Have you checked your table manners
lately?''), gift-giving and common courtesies.
</P>
<P>
   Woe betide the consultant who ignores (or needs) advice like
this:
</P>
<P>
   _ Learn how to hold and use your utensils; forks are not meant
to scratch backs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Never give a client an inappropriate gift.
</P>
<P>
   _ Say ``hello'' and ``goodbye,'' ``please'' and ``thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Be respectful of people and property.
</P>
<P>
   _ Even if you don't like a gift, remember to send a thank-you
card.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chew with your mouth closed. &QL;

<P>
   A five-foot horn of plenty made of silver and podolian ox horn,
which once belonged to King Charles XV of Sweden, is Victor
Niederhoffer's favorite in his collection of silver trophy pieces.
</P>
<P>
   But Niederhoffer can no longer afford his horn of plenty. He
desperately needs money, so Sotheby's will auction his extensive
collection on Tuesday. Indeed, he has already borrowed against the
$3 million that Sotheby's hopes to fetch.
</P>
<P>
   The money manager lost all his capital in October 1997, when the
Global Systems funds he managed for himself, his family and
investors were hurt first by his leveraged and unhedged
speculations in the Thai stock market, and then by his bet that the
United States market would not decline drastically. It plunged 7
percent on Oct. 27.
</P>
<P>
   The two catastrophes wiped out the funds, once valued at $130
million, leaving them with margin calls that those in the industry
estimated at $45 million.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at age 55, Victor Niederhoffer is struggling to pay his
debts, support the four of his six children who are still at home,
maintain continuity of the family's life style and tiptoe back into
the only business he knows: trading.
</P>
<P>
   The family still lives in the 20,000-square-foot home that he
built 12 years ago in Weston, Conn. (Since the debacle, he has
taken a mortgage against the sprawling house, complete with its own
squash court.)
</P>
<P>
   He has also raised cash by selling a small investment banking
business for about $1 million. Those moves have helped pay down
debts and provide the $1 million in pretax income he needs to
support his family and his tiny home-based trading operation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, by the standards of the rich, the severity of
Niederhoffer's crisis is evident in his need to part with the
silver collection, assembled in the halcyon days when he was making
millions.
</P>
<P>
   A comeback from the devastation _ both financially and
psychologically _ has been far harder than even Niederhoffer had
imagined. ``It is hard to be resilient when you are 55,'' he said
during an interview last week in the double-height library of his
home.
</P>
<P>
   Niederhoffer, dressed typically in jeans, sport shirt and socks
_ he is not a fan of shoes _ seemed surprised at how difficult it
had become to trade. ``When you have bad fortune, your suppliers
and customers are afraid,'' he said. ``I am on a very short
leash.''
</P>
<P>
   How is he doing? ``The jury is still out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He is looking to past recoveries as a blueprint for his future.
``I stopped playing squash for two years, when I was 23,'' he said.
``Then I had a match with a 50-year-old schoolteacher. I lost, and
I heard voices reverberating, saying I would never come back. But I
went on to win the national championship four more times.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, in his years as a trader, he had at least an
intellectual concept of the dangers. In a letter Niederhoffer wrote
for the Sotheby's catalogue, he said, ``The proximate reason I
collected was that my business of speculation in commodities was
highly volatile.'' He added that collecting gave him ``the ability
to store value in pieces I could enjoy, use and invest in.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver proved a prescient investment. In addition to putting his
own capital into the funds over the years, he said, ``I borrowed
money personally to put in.'' Even as the Thai debacle slashed the
value, he borrowed further. ``In retrospect, it was the worst
speculation of my life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After the funds imploded, ``I read an article that listed the 10
characteristics of depression,'' Niederhoffer said. ``I had all of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   But he never considered giving up. ``I have six children,'' he
said. ``I have a lot of obligations.''
</P>
<P>
   Always an eccentric _ he still says the only paper he reads is
The National Enquirer _ Niederhoffer said he had been lonely of
late. After 20 years of success, many investors had become friends.
Today, some remain loyal. Albert Hallac, whose company, Weston
Capital Management, marketed the funds and was himself an investor,
said Niederhoffer had handled the debacle with integrity.
</P>
<P>
   But many of his friendships unraveled. ``My phone stopped
ringing a lot,'' he said. ``When you stop making money for people,
you lose your utility.''
</P>
<P>
   He feels that it is important that he suffered with his
investors. ``A captain should never let the ship sink without going
down with it,'' he said. As for his own psychology, ``I don't
believe I had a death wish,'' Niederhoffer said. ``Where I was,
good things happened. Of the people who worked for me, six or seven
became billionaires.''
</P>
<P>
   Today he waivers between contrition about the losses and a
stubborn conviction that what he did was rational. ``I am saddened
and chastened,'' he said. ``My wisdom is quite suspect.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he added: ``My modus operandi is very analytical and
hopefully scientific. But I ran into some unexpected
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years from now, if things went well, would he make such
bets again? ``I would do it,'' he said. ``I don't think my strategy
was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   He compares his downfall with the bailout of Long Term Capital
Management, the much bigger hedge fund recently rescued by Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have used Long Term's breathing time,'' Niederhoffer
said. Instead, he is selling his silver.

MONEY SCAM SUSPECTS FREED ON BAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN KURKJIAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A 24-year-old BankBoston employee was released on
$100,000 bail in federal court Friday following her indictment
earlier in the week in connection with a $2.7 million money
laundering scheme that turned out to be an FBI sting operation.
</P>
<P>
   Two other defendants, whose accounts at the bank's West Newton
branch were among those used in the money laundering operation,
continued to be held after they were unable to satisfy bail
requirements set by US Magistrate Judge Lawrence P. Cohen. They
likely will be released next week, their lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   The three, Oksana Galchanskaya of Needham, Roman Luban, 44, and
Samuil Lyubomirsky, 41, both of Newton, will be arraigned Thursday
with six New York-area men who were charged in the 43-count
indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's bail hearing at the US District Court in Boston
produced few details about how the two-year sting operation began
or how the three Boston defendants were connected to the New York
defendants.
</P>
<P>
   FBI special agent John L. Riggi testified that the two
BankBoston accounts were used to accept wire transfers and issue
cashiers and regular checks to undercover FBI agents who posed as
narcotics dealers looking to launder their profits.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, the undercover agents gave $2.7
million in small bills to the New York individuals, who held
themselves out as being able to exchange the cash for checks and
wire transfers. In all, 64 accounts were used, including the two at
BankBoston, to launder the money, the indictment stated.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning by defense lawyers, Conrad J. Bletzer, Jr. and
Patrick J. Loftus, Riggi acknowledged that neither Luban or
Lyubomirsky were ever observed meeting with the New York principals
in the alleged scheme or with the FBI undercover agents who posed
as the drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a bit player,'' Bletzer said of Lyubomirsky, his client.
``At best he is a dupe who may have been used by someone else.''
Although he is not a citizen of the United States, Bletzer said
that Lyubomirsky was not a flight risk because he had been recently
been told that he needed surgery to remove a lump in his chest and
he may have to undergo cancer treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Following the hearing, Galchanskaya's lawyer, Jonathan Shapiro
said he believes she met Luban and Lyubomirsky either from her work
as a customer sales representative at the bank or through the
Russian emigre community in the Boston area. Galchanskaya is a
native of Uzbekistan and has been a US citizen since August 1991.
</P>
<P>
   To meet the $100,000 bail, Galchanskaya pledged the equity in
her Needham condominium and her ownership in two taxi medallions.

   Seeing Social Benefits In Corporate Disclosure &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to socially conscious investing, sorting good
companies from bad can be tricky. Now, a group of socially
conscious funds and institutional investors have joined
environmental organizations and unions to ask securities regulators
to require companies to disclose more about pollution they have
caused, worker benefits they have cut and neighborhoods they have
disrupted.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition, the Corporate Sunshine Working Group, includes
more than 60 organizations, from Kinder Lydenberg &AMP; Domini, a money
management firm, to Greenpeace to the United Steelworkers of
America.
</P>
<P>
   It plans to deliver a letter Monday to Arthur Levitt Jr.,
chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, requesting
stricter reporting rules. The group contends that better disclosure
by companies will help protect shareholders _ and prompt companies
to do good.
</P>
<P>
   Among the group's priorities is tightening the rules so that
companies responsible for polluting toxic sites are required to
tell their shareholders how much they must pay for a cleanup.
Current rules allow companies to escape disclosure of those
obligations by arguing that cleanup costs are not significant, even
if they add up to tens of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The group is also asking regulators to crack down on companies
that they say are violating even the current rules by giving
shareholders false and misleading information.

   A Rising Chorus of `No' Votes On Executive Stock Plans &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In growing numbers, shareholders are registering their
complaints about executive stock compensation plans. That is one
finding of a recent study conducted by Strategic Compensation
Research Associates, based in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The firm looked at shareholder votes on 2,250 plans submitted by
companies between July 1997 and June 1998 for new stock
compensation plans and additions to existing plans.
</P>
<P>
   Such management proposals have typically received ``no'' votes
of 5 percent to 10 percent, on average, in recent years. In the
last year, however, the average vote against management reached
13.8 percent. At 270 companies, it was higher than 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The negative votes would be even higher but for the fact that
many companies changed their proposals after floating trial
balloons with their biggest shareholders before putting their plans
to a vote, said Richard H. Wagner, president of Strategic
Compensation Research.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story that is not told in those statistics,'' he said,
``is the many concessions that boards are having to make to
institutional shareholders to secure their vote even before the
annual meeting.''

   25 Ways to Slice a Universe &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With a few thinly veiled jabs at its rivals in the mutual fund
rankings business, a new logo and even a new name, Lipper Inc.,
formerly Lipper Analytical Services, disclosed its revamped fund
classifications last week.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial
publisher, changed the way it classifies funds to incorporate a
fund's investment style and what actually ends up in a fund's
portfolio, rather than simply relying on the investment objective
laid out in its prospectus.
</P>
<P>
   Morningstar replaced old categories like growth and income,
equity income and aggressive growth with a ninefold array, divided
among large-, medium- and small-capitalization stocks and value,
blend and growth styles.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes Lipper, which recently was acquired by Reuters and has
been working on its new classifications for at least a year. Lipper
has constructed a 25-place matrix that classifies equity funds in
one of five capitalization categories _ large, flexible, middle,
small or micro _ and in one of five objectives _ income, value,
general, growth or aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   Steven M. Lipper, a senior vice president, said the
classifications were based on more than analysis of investment
style. ``Style-based structures don't address the question of
risk,'' he said, adding that Lipper's objectives incorporated a
measure of how far out on a limb a manager might be going.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies' classifications do not always agree with each
other. The Baron Asset fund, for example, is judged to be a
small-cap growth fund by Morningstar but is classified a mid-cap
growth equity fund by Lipper.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone prefers one classification system to another, it might
be fund managers, who with Lipper have more than twice as many
opportunities to find a grouping in which they can beat the
average.

<P>
   Total SA's fan club sent up a groan Dec. 1 when the news broke
that the company had agreed to buy Petrofina SA of Belgium for
$11.6 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts blanched at the rich 37 percent premium that Total, the
well-regarded No. 2 oil company in France, had agreed to pay. They
complained that Total was betraying a proven strategy _ a
concentration on exploration and production, the more profitable
upstream parts of the oil business _ by buying the downstream-heavy
Belgian company with its refineries, chemical plants and gas
stations.
</P>
<P>
   One analyst, Jeremy Hudson of Salomon Smith Barney, went as far
as slashing his rating of Total from ``outperform'' all the way to
``underperform,'' saying the Petrofina deal ``raises questions
about Total's future.'' And investors in general voted with their
feet, driving the stock price down 11 percent in a day.
</P>
<P>
   But Total chairman Thierry Desmarest says they groaned too soon.
</P>
<P>
   Desmarest (pronounced day-muh-RAY), a reserved man with an
aristocratic air who turns 53 on Friday, is not easily fazed. When
markets reacted sourly to the Petrofina deal, he flew to London and
New York to make his case to money managers face to face. Within a
week, Total had doubled its estimates of the cost savings it will
wring from the merged company, and Desmarest was projecting that
adding Petrofina would accelerate the growth in Total's earnings
per share to 16 or 17 percent a year, from 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Investors may not believe it yet _ Total's stock finished the
week 21 percent below its last close before the merger announcement
_ but the company's track record suggests that those promising cost
and profit figures aren't just wishful thinking. In Desmarest's
five years as chairman, Total has shown how a European oil company
can excel, increasing production, sales and profits in an era of
slumping oil prices. Even in the painful first half of 1998, when
the industry was watching a quarter of its earnings evaporate,
Total managed to hold its own damage to less than 6 percent of net
income.
</P>
<P>
   Achievements like that have made Total popular with British and
American fund managers, who hold 42 percent of its shares. Total
stands out in a country noted for cosseted state-owned industries
that hemorrhage cash; large, well-run investor-owned companies like
it are scarce.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast with Elf Aquitaine, France's largest oil company,
is stark. Despite broad strides toward competitiveness since its
privatization in 1991, Elf retains an ``air of French
administration,'' said Aymeric de Gillaret, oil analyst at Societe
Generale de Paris in London. ``Total is free enterprise.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, it is largely because of Desmarest's thick-skinned
managerial talent for getting productivity up while keeping costs
down, coupled with an entrepreneurial audacity that does not shy
from tough decisions. Last year, in the face of a firestorm of
criticism and threats from the United States, he signed a $2
billion agreement to develop the immense South Pars gas fields in
Iran; he won his wager when Washington, after bitter debate, backed
down and waived sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, much has changed at Elf under Philippe Jaffre, who
became chairman around the time Desmarest took the helm at Total
and has since made his own considerable headway in cutting costs.
</P>
<P>
   But productivity at Elf continues to lag far behind Total. Last
year Total produced $584,000 of revenue for each employee, while
Elf managed only $505,000. And Total far outshone Elf in
profitability, with an operating margin of 6.1 percent of revenue,
compared with Elf's 2.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Before becoming chairman, Desmarest oversaw Total's worldwide
exploration and production, winning concessions in places like West
Africa, where drilling has revealed immense oil deposits. Since
1993, he has secured promising exploration rights in Nigeria,
Indonesia and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Such aggressive exploration pushed up Total's crude-oil
production to 780 million barrels last year, 44 percent more than
in 1990, without increasing production staff. The acquisition of
Petrofina will mean an additional 240 million barrels a year.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the Petrofina acquisition undoes a streamlining
move that Total made last year, when it sold its refineries and gas
stations in North America to Ultramar Diamond Shamrock. Total said
last Thursday that it would seek a buyer or partner for some of
Petrofina's U.S. refineries and gas stations as well.
</P>
<P>
   But Desmarest makes no apologies for the overall thrust back
into refining and retailing. ``Over the next five years, our
concern was to have our downstream pole strong enough,'' he said.
``It's important to keep sufficient balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts share that view. De Gillaret of Societe Generale
said the acquisition was ``wise, given the market developments,''
referring to planned combinations like Exxon-Mobil and British
Petroleum-Amoco that threaten to marginalize Total.
</P>
<P>
   Still, rebalancing the business is not the main point of the
merger. Steven Pfeifer, an oil analyst at Prudential Securities,
said the key was the chance for both companies to cut costs. Total
has said it would probably eliminate 1,000 of a combined 90,000
jobs, mostly by attrition; streamlined refinery management and
combined purchasing would yield further savings.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Pfeifer argued, Desmarest's cost-savings
projections are too modest. Pfeifer noted that British Petroleum
and Amoco expect their merger to yield savings equal to about 5.1
percent of their combined market capitalization by 2001, while
Total and Petrofina are forecasting just 3.7 percent by 2002.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Breaking with House Republicans, Gov. George Pataki
says he believes that President Clinton should be censured, a
punishment that he says would permit Congress to ``put this behind
us and focus on a positive agenda for change.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 45-minute interview in his Manhattan office Thursday, the
Republican governor offered his most detailed remarks to date on
the impeachment proceedings, describing censure as an ``attractive
and appropriate'' alternative, provided that Congress finds it
constitutionally sound. Censure has been a subject of some debate
among scholars of the Constitution, although a substantial number
of officeholders, Democrats and Republicans alike, have embraced
it.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks by the newly re-elected Pataki coincide with efforts
by both sides in the struggle leading up to impeachment votes on
the House floor next week to win the support of undecided moderate
Republicans, many from the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said he would not call fellow Republicans to lobby them
on behalf of censure. He described their decision as a personal one
that should be based on their own beliefs and on their view of the
kind of precedent a censure vote might set.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless his newly stated position, similar to one taken
earlier this week by a close ally, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.,
could make it easier for House Republicans from New York to vote
against impeachment. Although the governor is entering the fray
rather late, he has influence with a few upstate Republican
lawmakers who have yet to announce any decision.
</P>
<P>
   Asked her own view, New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman took a
different tack, arguing that Congress should first vote on
impeachment before even considering censure. Whitman, who earlier
in this scandal-ridden year called on the president to resign, said
she had not followed the debate closely enough to offer an opinion
on how the House should vote on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   At City Hall in New York, meanwhile, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
reiterated his opposition to impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that impeachment should only occur when a president
just about can't function anymore,'' the Republican mayor said,
adding, ``I think there are a lot of serious issues about the
president's conduct, but I don't think it rises to the level of
removing the president from office.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki is among a group of Republican governors who have
maintained that congressional Republicans' focus on impeachment
contributed to the party's weak showing in the November elections.
That was particularly the case in New York, he has said, where
D'Amato lost his re-election bid.
</P>
<P>
   But Pataki said in the interview that his support for censure
was based not on political calculation but rather on what he views
as an appropriate response to Clinton's wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you look at the vote in the Judiciary Committee
from a strategic standpoint or the impact it will have on the
party,'' Pataki said. ``It's just too important. This is just
something that you have to put aside and vote based on your true
belief.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki is by nature cautious; he tends to delay taking a
position on difficult issues. He has previously signaled his
concern about the behavior of Washington Republicans, but declined
to say what he thought should happen.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said that perjury before a grand jury is a ``major, major
matter,'' but that it was mitigated in Clinton's case because ``it
was about his personal behavior.'' Censure, Pataki said, ``is an
attractive and appropriate step because it does allow us to put
this behind us and focus on a positive agenda for change _ and yet
at the same time publicly and officially take an action saying that
Bill Clinton did something wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I really want to see Congress focus on issues that affect
people's lives, policies that affect people's lives, as opposed to
this. I just would hope they would act quickly and try to act in a
non-partisan a way as possible, based on what they view as right,''
Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   And the governor was critical of Republicans and Democrats for
their handling of the issue. ``I think on both sides you have
people who are approaching it strictly as politics: It's `I want to
get this guy' or `He's our guy and I want to defend him.' ''

CLINTON OFFERS TO ACCEPT CENSURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES AND MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, making a dramatic and
unambiguous appeal to moderate Republicans, Friday expressed
``profound remorse'' for putting the country through the
impeachment ordeal and said he was ready to accept ``rebuke and
censure.''
</P>
<P>
   But initial indications were that Clinton's speech did not help.
As many as six previously undecided Republicans announced Friday
they would back impeachment or were now leaning strongly for it.
</P>
<P>
   Just just minutes before the House Judiciary Committee approved
the first article of impeachment, Clinton walked somberly from the
Oval Office to the Rose Garden, and for the first time expressed
his willingness to accept censure, the preferred alternative to
impeachment among Democrats and some moderate Republicans,
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing, not piety, nor tears, nor wit, nor torment can alter
what I have done,'' Clinton said. ``I must make my peace with that.
I must also be at peace with the fact that the public consequences
of my actions are in the hands of the American people and their
representatives in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should they determine that my errors of word and deed require
their rebuke and censure, I am ready to accept that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Except for sanctioning his censure, Clinton failed to move much
beyond his earlier apologies for lying about an affair with a
former White House intern. It was not clear Friday night what he
meant by saying he would accept a rebuke.
</P>
<P>
   Though some undecided Republicans have been demanding that
Clinton acknowledge having lied or perjured himself during the
investigation of his relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky, his
statement stopped well short of such an admission.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Bob Franks of New Jersey was perhaps the most
closely watched Republican because he had written a letter to
Clinton last week urging the president to admit he committed
perjury. If Clinton made such an admission, Franks would probably
vote against impeachment. But after watching Clinton's speech
Friday, Franks all but declared for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was needed from the president today was an admission, not
contrition,'' Franks said. ``He needed to come to terms with the
fact that he has broken the law by lying under oath to the grand
jury and committing perjury.'' Unless Clinton makes such a
statement, Franks said, he is prepared to vote for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Saxby Chambliss of Georgia declared for
impeachment and said: ``Having viewed the president's defense
before the Judiciary Committee, I believe he has failed to refute
these charges or overcome the evidence presented.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican, Representative Rodney P. Frelinghuysen of
New Jersey, announced immediately after Clinton's speech that he
would support impeachment. The Clinton speech ``confirmed it for
him,'' a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans who announced before Clinton's speech Friday that
they would support impeachment included Representatives Lincoln
Diaz-Balart and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, both of Florida, according to
the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments came on the eve of a four-day trip to the
Middle East that begins Saturday, and amid a cacophony of advice
from White House aides and Democratic leaders over how to try to
sway two dozen House Republicans who are undecided on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his aides and Democratic leaders had suggested that
Clinton wait until after the Judiciary Committee acts because
anything he said would be drowned out by the committee's actions.
</P>
<P>
   Others had argued that he should make a statement before the
committee votes and before leaving for the Middle East. White House
aides left open the possibility that Clinton might make another
statement before the full House votes next week.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's former labor secretary, Robert Reich, said that even
Clinton's embrace of censure could cut both ways. ``It may make it
marginally easier for a few wavering members to vote in favor of
censure knowing that he will accept it,'' said the Brandeis
University economist.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other, it's entirely possible that a few wavering
members may be persuaded to vote for impeachment because he seems
so eager to accept censure,'' he said. ``They may figure it's not
enough of a punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking pained and remoseful, and with the wind ruffling the
paper containing his statement, Clinton said he had been
``grappling with how best to reconcile myself to the American
people, to acknowledge my own wrongdoing and still maintain my
focus on the work of the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had left his defense to his lawyers and had nothing
to add to what they have argued. ``What I want the American people
to know, what I want the Congress to know is that I am profoundly
sorry for all I have done wrong in words and deeds. I never should
have misled the country, the Congress, my friends or my family.
Quite simply, I gave in to my shame,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the past few months had been a ``tortuous process'' of
coming to terms with what he had done. ``I understand that
accountability demands consequences, and I'm prepared to accept
them. Painful though the condemnation of Congress would be, it
would pale in comparison to the consequences of the pain I have
caused my family. There is no greater agony,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A number of other undecided Republicans said through aides that
they either had not watched Clinton's remarks and saw them and were
still undecided. But one House aide familiar with the vote-counting
said Clinton's comments ``didn't move the process forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Steve Chabot, an Ohio Republican on the Judiciary
Committee who voted for the articles of impeachment, said he
believed Clinton's remarks would have no impact on GOP members.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's statement was ``not nearly enough,'' Chabot said. ``He
still has not admitted he lied under oath.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Democrats expressed concern that Clinton's comments did not
go far enough. Representative Martin Meehan of Massachusetts had
called for Clinton to admit he lied, in order to gain support from
moderate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he hasn't won over any moderate Republicans, I'm very
disappointed,'' Meehan said. ``This is going to be a very close
vote.'' Meehan said that, contrary to the fears of the White House,
a presidential admission of lying would not result in criminal
prosecution after Clinton leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Charles Schumer of New York, one of the most
outspoken critics of impeachment, said he felt Clinton's comment
would be well-received by the public, but probably wouldn't
persuade most Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fearful his statement will have no effect on them,''
Schumer said of the GOP members. ``If the vote were held now,
impeachment would pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer said his best hope was that Americans would become
outraged this weekend at the Judiciary Committee's action and
convey that view to their congressmen. If that happens, Schumer
said, ``the counter reaction will build. It may sway some votes
against impeachment.''

BRAZIL REVISITS PENSIONS, VOTING TO TRIM BENEFITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ With a towering $41.5 billion bailout
from the International Monetary Fund in the offing, world leaders
and economists nervously scrutinized Brazil last week as its
Congress faced an important vote on cutting pension deficits.
</P>
<P>
   But not everybody in Congress was thinking of reform.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the case last year, when the Asian collapse prompted
instant total congressional cooperation, the government of
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, whose coalition grew more
fractious after recent elections, faces a tougher fight to push
through unpopular economic measures.
</P>
<P>
   As the vote on the pension approached, some coalition allies
jostled for Cabinet posts. Others fielded calls from opponents of
the bill. One hundred additional legislators stayed away.
</P>
<P>
   When the unexpected defeat came, the nose dive in financial
markets was instant, reminding Brazilians that the benefit of the
doubt so readily granted to their enormous economy a year ago had
been exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil is under immense pressure to convince investors that it
can streamline its government to reduce its dependence on outside
financing.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago the country seemed to be hovering near the brink of
collapse and threatening to pull down the hemisphere with it. More
than $30 billion flew from the foreign reserves, as investors who
had been focusing on the potential for growth instead looked at the
government budget deficit, swollen to 8 percent of the gross
national product, and its debt of $530 billion.
</P>
<P>
   For economists and others the vote on Dec. 3 highlighted the
difficulties that Cardoso faces in his quest to slash spending and
the variety of factions his administration will have to court.
</P>
<P>
   Chastened by the defeat, the government lobbied hard to win
congressional approval for a measure to increase pension
contributions from charities and small businesses. Although the
private pension system's troubles are minor compared with the
cavernous deficit in the public retirement system, the victory
showed that the government could pick up the thread of change that
it had dropped the week before.
</P>
<P>
   Financial analysts acknowledged that they might have overreacted
to the congressional setback. The Sao Paulo stock market climbed
back from the 8.8 percent ditch that it fell into the day after the
defeat of the pension bill.
</P>
<P>
   But investors and economists also described the stock plunge as
inevitable. It corrected a surge of unrealistic enthusiasm that
followed the IMF commitment to Brazil and priced in the political
uncertainties that investors had initially overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   In national elections two months ago government-allied parties
increased their representation in Congress. But the new allies
represented a wide range of interests that will force the
government to make greater concessions to win support.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts say the pension bill failed because the
government, overly confident, neglected the legwork to rally
support. The administration also packed too much into one measure,
focusing on active and retired government workers along with other
groups because of time pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not the classical opposition-led defeat but something
that resulted from confusion and discontent within the government's
own ranks,'' the chief equities strategist for Banco Icatu, Rodrigo
Fiaes, wrote in a report about the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would have raised pension costs for government workers
who earned more than $960 a month and forced government retirees to
contribute for the first time. It would have also stripped workers
unemployed for long periods of an array of government protections,
including accident, maternity, death and retraining benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Given the deepening recession, which is producing Brazil's worst
unemployment in 15 years, the measure was bitterly attacked,
underscoring the difficulty that the government will have in
winning approval for austerity measures as hardships worsen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you add together the ambition of the allied parties and the
social crisis in Brazil, you're going to have a very explosive
situation for the government,'' said Marcello Deda, leader of the
opposition Workers' Party in the lower chamber of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The tension erupted again this week, as the powerful president
of the Senate, Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, offended that he had not
been consulted, blocked Cardoso's efforts to convene a special
session of Congress during the holidays to consider extending a tax
on financial transactions and other austerity measures.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, Magalhaes told reporters in Brasilia, ``did not go
through me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And a decision about an extraordinary session that doesn't go
through me is worth nothing,'' the senator added.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time he pledged to help advocates of land reform who
sought his support in blocking $600 million in budget cuts that
would affect land distribution to the poor.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Social Security Minister Waldeck Ornelas said the bill that
Congress rejected last week would be presented again in February,
when a new session convenes. Last month, before the IMF package was
announced, the government won a significant victory toward trimming
Social Security for public workers by establishing minimum
retirement ages and a pension ceiling of $960 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally their generous retirement system guarantees
benefits equal to a worker's highest salary for as long as he or
she lives. It has been fueling a pension deficit that experts
expect will exceed $40 billion next year, even with complete
success for the changes, whose savings will be fully realized only
in later years.
</P>
<P>
   This week the government was more successful. It neutralized a
cluster bomb of measures to trim government pension benefits that
had again been crammed into a single bill and successfully
negotiated with the Workers' Party to win support. The government
also agreed to weaken elements of the bill to counter opposition
from legislators who draw tax advantages for private hospitals and
schools that they own under the current rules.
</P>
<P>
   The bill this week would limit Social Security exemptions for
nonprofit organizations, increase pension contributions by small
businesses and raise pension costs for workers in risky and onerous
jobs. Congressional sources estimated that the plan would bring in
$1 billion in revenues next year.
</P>
<P>
   With the victory the government has so far won approval in
Congress for measures that should supply more than $6 billion of
the $23.5 billion in savings promised for next year. It remains for
Congress to extend and increase a tax on financial transactions,
which the government expects will raise $5.8 billion next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress would also have to pass the reduced budget, which
Cardoso is counting on for $7 billion in savings. And it has to
vote on the guidelines for laying off tens of thousands of Civil
Service workers.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A 19-year-old college student sat alone with a computer as a
commanding voice echoed through the windowless room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now go to No. 5,'' the voice said. ``Find out what the weather
is like in San Jose.''
</P>
<P>
   The student was taking part in a test of the Go Network, Walt
Disney Co.'s answer to Yahoo, America Online and all the other
``portals'' to the Internet _ entry points to a world of
information, entertainment and commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Go wasn't going so well, however, at this late October test in
Sunnyvale, Calif. As the student scowled, three young women behind
a one-way mirror monitored each of her hesitant clicks of the
mouse. It took her a long time to find the weather section on Go's
crowded front page; then she was stumped, because she thought she
needed to know San Jose's ZIP code. She could have determined the
weather in Silicon Valley a lot more quickly by stepping outside.
</P>
<P>
   Disney hopes that it has gotten the bugs out of Go by now,
especially since it is offering a preview of the site (go.com) to
the public starting Dec. 14. While the company is already a major
presence on the Internet _ with popular sites for sports fanatics
(espn.com), news hounds (abcnews.com) and soap opera viewers
(abc.com), among hundreds of others _ it is now making a bigger bet
on cyberspace than any other media concern in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In a complex deal in June, Disney traded some Internet
operations plus $90 million in cash for a 43 percent stake in
Infoseek Corp., an also-ran Internet search engine company, which
will run Go. Disney will funnel $156 million to Infoseek to promote
the new Web site on ABC, which Disney owns, and on Disney's cable
channels.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Disney will deploy everything from its cruise ships to
its theme parks to trumpet Go, just as it stretched its every
synergistic muscle for ``A Bug's Life,'' its current hit movie.
</P>
<P>
   Why bother?
</P>
<P>
   Disney is entering a crowded field in which big media companies
have repeatedly foundered _ most notably its rival Time Warner,
whose pioneering Pathfinder portal has struggled as more nimble
Internet companies have vaulted ahead.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, Disney's offering has little to distinguish it
from the leading portal, Yahoo, which sets the standard for being
fast, easy to use and loaded with handy features _ news, financial
data, electronic mail, chat groups and the like. America Online
incorporates those same features in the Internet access it provides
to half the nation's wired homes, and it just agreed to buy
Netscape Communications, largely for its popular Internet portal.
Other rivals abound, including Excite, Lycos, Microsoft's MSN and
Snap, which is backed by NBC.
</P>
<P>
   And given that hardly any of these businesses are profitable,
Disney _ with so many opportunities in movies, television and theme
parks _ could have found easier ways to get a return on its
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Disney chairman Michael Eisner has personally
orchestrated much of the Go initiative, down to selecting its
traffic-light logo. He concluded that Disney had no choice but to
enter the fray. ``We want to be a relevant company,'' he said in an
interview last week. ``I don't want to have our company be in the
railroad business while people are flying overhead in airplanes.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to much of the evidence so far, Eisner is betting that
``content'' _ the information and entertainment created by
companies like Disney _ will give Go an edge over Yahoo and its
kin, which dismiss content as a mere commodity, preferring to link
users to information rather than originate it themselves. Though
the user's first encounter with Go is a screen that _ quite
purposely _ looks like Yahoo's, clicking on a link to ``news'' or
``sports'' or ``kids'' leads directly to Disney-generated content.
</P>
<P>
   And every page _ along with every other Disney Web site _ links
back to Go, in what the company hopes can become a largely
self-contained cyberuniverse.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, America Online and others have reduced investments in
original Web content. ``It's a very big bet to cast your lot with
one group of content sites and assume what is good today will also
be good tomorrow,'' said Jerry Yang, a co-founder of Yahoo. ``We
have felt that it is important to stay independent.''
</P>
<P>
   But Eisner argued that as the Internet matured, Disney's
strengths would be more important. ``As technology becomes
comfortable, the product takes over,'' he said, comparing the
Internet now to cable television in its early days. ``At first, the
point was to improve the picture on your broadcast channels. Now it
has turned into a product play: How good is the Disney Channel or
the Discovery Channel?''
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, analysts who have seen previews of Go say that
despite a few nifty features, it does not seem to be anything
special. ``I don't see Disney as an also-ran, given how much money
they will throw at this,'' said Patrick Keane, an analyst with
Jupiter Communications, a consulting firm in New York. ``But I'm
not sure how many users they can siphon from Yahoo or Excite.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding the Pieces
</P>
<P>
   As much as Eisner now extols the Go Network, he was not always
so enthusiastic. In March, he assembled a group of key advisers and
executives at his home in Aspen, Colo., to make sense of what
Disney should do on line.
</P>
<P>
   Portals were hot, and Disney didn't have one. Instead, it had
focused its early Internet efforts on developing sites related to
Disney content. Beginning in 1995, it has been building a bevy of
family-oriented sites, accessible at Disney.com.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Disney bought part of Starwave, the Seattle company
that created its ESPN site, from Paul Allen, the billionaire
co-founder of Microsoft. It then had Starwave start ABCnews.com.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in front of the fireplace at Eisner's spacious house,
Jake Winebaum, 39, the ambitious head of Disney's Internet group,
and Michael Slade, 41, Starwave's chairman, argued that without a
portal, all Disney had built so far was at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became clear that if people's appetite for news and sports
was satiated at the place their voyage was starting on the
Internet, there would be fewer people coming to our sites,''
Winebaum said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   They recommended that Disney buy Infoseek, which was only then
beginning to recover from internal conflicts that had sapped its
momentum in a rapidly changing market. Infoseek's new chief
executive, Harry Motro, who had started CNN's Web site, realized
that the company needed a big brother and was eager to sell out to
Disney.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a problem. The $1 billion price tag _ inflated by
the surging stock prices of Internet companies _ blew the lid off
all the rigorous financial models that Disney uses to judge
acquisitions. So at the Aspen meeting, Eisner rejected the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a problem overpaying for things,'' he explained later.
``Our company is selling at a real multiple of real earnings, so
I've got to be careful.'' Instead, Starwave was assigned to build a
portal from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Through the spring, as other portal companies grew rapidly,
Infoseek flirted with other possible partners, including Netscape.
Winebaum kept pushing to find a way for Disney to buy a portal.
</P>
<P>
   Then Disney chief financial officer Thomas Staggs hit upon a way
to gain control of Infoseek for less than $1 billion. Disney had
paid $82 million for 42 percent of Starwave, with the option to buy
the rest of Allen's stake for about $162 million. But with the
market for Internet companies so hot, Starwave was worth far, far
more than $244 million. Why not come up with a trade?
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Disney gave Starwave _ and $90 million cash _ to
Infoseek in return for 43 percent of Infoseek, a stake valued at
about $900 million when the deal was announced in mid-June; Disney
has the option to raise its stake to 50 percent. Infoseek promised
to buy $165 million of advertising from Disney, with money Disney
would lend to it.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, Disney and Infoseek agreed to build a new portal
before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Under Construction
</P>
<P>
   When Barak Berkowitz walked into a conference room at Infoseek's
headquarters in Sunnyvale in late October, his jaw dropped at the
sight of a 30-foot-long wall covered floor to ceiling with a grid
of text, lines and little dots. The grid mapped out exactly what
had been done and was yet to be done to complete the 30 separate
features in the first version of the Go portal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is awesome,'' said Berkowitz, general manager of the
portal. He was impressed, not because of anything on the vast
chart, but because for the first time someone had assembled all the
information in one place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making 30 things for dinner, and we want to make sure
everything is done and hot when the bell rings,'' said Sue
LaChance, a former librarian, who is the project manager. ``And
it's not like we have 30 ovens either.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the work was simply an attempt to match the features
offered by other portals. For example, Go will have a
personal-finance section, with financial analysis software
developed by Starwave.
</P>
<P>
   Yet each new feature puts more strain on designers trying to
keep the service accessible to novices, still the fastest-growing
portion of the market. An Internet portal, after all, is a control
panel to the online universe, with buttons, links and boxes that
promise to deliver the canon of human knowledge, a personal
relationship with every like-minded user and a catalog of all goods
for sale anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   All this has to be designed for small computer monitors, without
complex graphics that bog down slow modems, and with the 219 colors
that Web browsers can reliably reproduce. And, oh yes, most users
won't read any of the instructions printed on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce and Content
</P>
<P>
   Disney and Infoseek are proud of an innovation _ an
organizational structure called ``follow me tabs'' _ that lets
people switch among the main subdivisions of Go _ topics, shopping
sites, local information, chat rooms, Internet searching _ and
still see information related to the topic they are researching.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the screen, looking like file-folder tabs, are
buttons for each of these sections. Someone looking for sites about
fishing, for example, could click the Community tab to find message
boards with fishing discussions, the Shop tab to find fishing
equipment stores and the Local tab to find fishing holes near them.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, it's the shopping section that will be crucial,
because Go's biggest revenue stream is likely to be from
commissions paid by online merchants.
</P>
<P>
   As they can with other portals, users will be able to customize
the site, specifying the news topics, stock quotes and sports
scores they want to see when they type in go.com.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   NORTH HOLLYWOOD, Calif. _ As a junior executive in the
circulation department of Time Inc. in the early 1980s, Jake
Winebaum peppered his bosses with ideas for new magazines. One idea
was aimed at ambitious yuppies: Advance, ``the magazine for moving
ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Time rejected the magazine, Winebaum himself certainly
moved ahead. Now, as head of the Buena Vista Internet Group, he has
a spot on Walt Disney Co.'s organizational chart that is parallel
to those of the heads of the company's movie studio and ABC
television network.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, Winebaum has been filled with
entrepreneurial ideas, but has mainly stayed at established
companies. He moved from Time to U.S. News &AMP; World Report and
finally struck out on his own to start Family Fun magazine in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   After two issues, Winebaum sold the magazine to Disney, a move
that started him on a rapid ascent through its management ranks _
first in publishing, later in its dalliance with starting an
all-news cable channel (it decided to pass), and by 1995 in its
nascent Internet efforts. He started the family-oriented Web site,
Disney.com, and a profitable online store that sells Disney-brand
merchandise. And he has become an Internet evangelist in the
corporation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent a lot of my time all over Disney helping them
understand what the Internet is and why it's important to their
business,'' Winebaum said recently, slouched in an easy chair in
his office. With his corduroy shirt untucked over a white T-shirt,
and with his brown suede shoes plopped on the coffee table, he
looked more like a wayward teen-ager than a 39-year-old new-media
mogul.
</P>
<P>
   But Winebaum works hard to make the right impression. One former
colleague recalls how, in preparation for a visit by Disney
chairman Michael Eisner, Winebaum held two separate rehearsals of
his staff, blocking out where Eisner would walk and what people
would say to him.
</P>
<P>
   A current colleague, Michael Slade, the chairman of Starwave,
the Internet production company recently bought by Disney, said,
``The best way to understand Jake is that he's a great athlete.''
Winebaum was a ski racer at Dartmouth and now wind-surfs and runs
marathons.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very competitive and wants to win,'' Slade said. ``Two
years ago, he worked for someone who worked for someone who worked
for Eisner. Now he works for Eisner.''

FORMER R.I. GOVERNOR PLEADS GUILTY IN CORRUPTION CASE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a surprise ending to one of Rhode Island's biggest
corruption cases, former Gov. Edward DiPrete pleaded guilty Friday
to 18 charges of corruption, admitting that he accepted bribes and
extorted money from contractors while in office.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a long history of corruption, Rhode Island has never
seen a governor go the prison.
</P>
<P>
   DiPrete, 64, said he made the plea in exchange for leniency for
his son, a co-defendant in the case, which was to have gone to
trial next month.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Francis Darigan of Superior Court in Providence sentenced
DiPrete to one year in a minimum security prison. As a first-time
offender, he will be eligible for a work-release program, allowing
him to work outside the prison in the day.
</P>
<P>
   The former governor's son, Dennis DiPrete, 40, pleaded guilty
Friday to a campaign finance violation while on his father's
election committee and was fined $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Edward DiPrete said he regretted taking the
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressures of raising money for campaign spending obviously
clouded my perspective,'' he said. ``However, I can assure every
citizen of Rhode Island that you received the very best.''
</P>
<P>
   DiPrete was governor from 1985 to 1991. He and his son were
indicted in 1994 on bribery, racketeering, extortion and perjury
charges. He was accused of taking nearly $300,000 in bribes from
engineers, architects and others in exchange for state contracts.

<P>
   In 1994, Thomas Fay, the former chief justice of the state
Supreme Court, was convicted of violating ethics laws. Embezzlement
in credit unions caused the state's banking system to collapse in
1991. In 1984, more than 30 Providence workers and contractors were
indicted in conspiracy and fraud; 16 went to prison.

   Julio A. Bofill, 42, owner of Infinity Photo Studio in
Manhattan, began studying photography a few years ago at LaGuardia
Community College in New York City. The experience, he says,
``turned my whole life around.''
</P>
<P>
   When he entered LaGuardia, he said, it was as part of a
work-release program after serving five years in prison for drug
possession. Because the college has a mandatory cooperative
education program that requires students to gain experience in jobs
related to their studies, Bofill began taking pictures for the
school during special functions.
</P>
<P>
   The co-op work confirmed his career choice, put a job on his
resume and helped pay for photography supplies he needed after
transferring to New York University, where he earned a degree in
studio art.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, not everyone's experience with cooperative education
is so dramatic. But even a negative experience can have long-term
benefits. Another former LaGuardia student, Ximena Grimaldi, 26,
wanted to become an occupational therapist. But when she got a job
assisting therapists, she found working with injured people
emotionally draining.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was heartbreaking,'' she said. ``I decided I wanted to stay
in the medical field, but in a slightly different environment.''
Now she plans to become a registered dietitian.
</P>
<P>
   Co-op programs help college students figure out what to study
and give them experience that can lead to better jobs and higher
salaries after graduation than they might receive otherwise. And
they earn income to help with college costs.
</P>
<P>
   Annual tuition, fees and room and board during the 1998-99
academic year averaged $22,533 at four-year private institutions
and $10,458 at four-year public institutions, according to the
College Board's Annual Survey of Colleges. Tuition averaged $7,333
at private two-year colleges and $1,633 at public two-year
colleges.
</P>
<P>
   A participant in a co-op program can typically earn $2,500 to
$14,000 a year, according to the National Commission for
Cooperative Education, based in Boston. (Information is available
at its Web site, www.co-op.edu, and at the site of the Cooperative
Education Association in Columbia, Md., www.ceainc.org.)
</P>
<P>
   Students may find financial aid pared as they earn the extra
money, but the income is theirs to manage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earnings go directly to students, who can use it for anything
they want,'' said Gary Hamme, a dean at Drexel University in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tetlow, 26, a pre-med major at Antioch College in Ohio,
had a co-op job at the National Institutes of Health in Washington,
where she trained monkeys that were being used in learning and
memory experiments. ``I saved enough to buy my own car,'' she said.
Antioch is one of the few liberal arts schools with a co-op
education requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Co-op programs are different from the work-study jobs provided
with federal aid, which may have little to do with a student's
studies, and from internships, which may be related to career
choices but are often unpaid.
</P>
<P>
   Many schools have found co-op programs to be a big draw.
LaGuardia, the first community college in the country to require
co-op education, opened with 500 students in 1971. It now has
10,000 students in degree programs and an additional 25,000 in
continuing education programs, said Harry Heinemann, its dean in
charge of cooperative education.
</P>
<P>
   Drexel, which also requires students to do co-op work, saw its
freshman class jump from 950 in 1995 to 2,100 this year. A survey
of the entering class found that 95 percent enrolled because of the
co-op program, Hamme said.
</P>
<P>
   About 900 colleges and universities now offer co-op programs,
and about 200,000 students are participating in them this year,
according to the cooperative education commission.
</P>
<P>
   Co-op programs are either ``alternating,'' in which students
work full-time and then go to school full-time, or ``parallel,'' in
which students work part-time while going to school. Participants
usually earn bachelor's degrees in four or five years.
</P>
<P>
   Students typically must apply and interview for the co-op jobs.
In some cases, they integrate work experience with classroom
studies by completing work-related academic projects or writing
reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of my friends at other colleges are very worried about
getting a job after they graduate,'' said Jennifer Strausser, 21, a
junior and computer science major at Drexel. She has worked in
co-op jobs at an Internet development company and an insurance
company. ``I feel I have a real leg up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Employers are also enthusiastic. The Cigna Corp. in Philadelphia
hires about 50 Drexel students each year, and about 10 return to
Cigna full-time after graduation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good opportunity to get students into our
organization early,'' said Joseph Braunstein, a senior vice
president at Cigna Group Insurance. His experience with co-op
programs is personal as well as professional. He began working at
Cigna 27 years ago as a Drexel co-op student and never left.

D.   TENNANT BRYAN, FOUNDER OF MEDIA GENERAL INC. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., N.C., Va.)  (rl) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   D. Tennant Bryan, founder of Media General Inc., the Richmond,
Va.-based newspaper, television and communications company, died
Wednesday at his home in Richmond. He was 92.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan began his career in 1928 as a reporter for The Richmond
News Leader, the family-owned afternoon newspaper, which later
merged with the morning Richmond Times-Dispatch. He was a
third-generation newspaper publisher, and his newspapers were a
leading voice against school desegregation in Virginia in the
mid-1950s.
</P>
<P>
   His role in the 1980s as the builder of a company with a large
television component might have surprised publishers who heard
Bryan address the American Newspaper Publishers Association in
1960.
</P>
<P>
   Nearing the end of two years as president of the association,
Bryan warned that the troubles of the broadcasting industry, which
was experiencing a quiz-show scandal and other problems, were
caused by its inability to separate the influence of advertisers
from programming.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers' editorial independence from the influence of
advertisers was crucial to maintaining credibility and dominance,
Bryan said. ``It has now become abundantly clear that neither
television nor any other existing medium can displace the
newspaper, which along with food and utilities remains an
indispensable daily service in the home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan was not above hedging his bets, however. In 1966, Richmond
Newspapers Inc., the family holding company, sold stock to the
public, and three years later Media General was created as a
holding company for the family's expanding interests.
</P>
<P>
   Today, in addition to 21 daily newspapers, including The Tampa
Tribune in Florida and The Winston-Salem Journal in North Carolina,
Media General owns 14 broadcast television stations, including
WFLA-TV in Tampa, and cable operations with about 235,000
subscribers in Virginia. Media General also has interests in
newsprint plants, recycling operations and online communications.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan's son, J. Stewart Bryan III, became publisher of the
newspapers in 1978 and succeeded his father as chairman of Media
General in 1990. A Bryan family trust has maintained control of the
company through its ownership of a majority of a special class of
shares.
</P>
<P>
   He is also survived by two daughters, Mary Tennant Bryan Perkins
of Richmond and Florence Bryan Fowlkes of Chevy Chase, Md.; three
grandchildren and a great-grandson. His wife, Mary Harkness
Davidson Tennant, died in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   David Tennant Bryan was born on Aug. 3, 1906, in Richmond. He
attended the University of Virginia for three years before joining
The News Leader. After working his way up through positions meant
to prepare him to be publisher, Bryan resigned as vice president
and general manager of Richmond Newspapers in 1942 to join the
Navy. He served as an officer in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   While Bryan was on active duty in 1944, his father, John Stewart
Bryan, died, and two years later Bryan returned to Richmond
Newspapers as publisher and president. He remained chairman of
Media General from its founding until July 1990 and was a board
member until last year.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan was known in the newspaper industry as a fierce defender
of access to government information. In 1966, he led a trade
group's fight against a proposal by a panel of the American Bar
Association to sharply restrict the access of the press to pretrial
hearings and information about individuals charged with, but not
yet tried for, crimes. In 1968, the proposals were adopted by the
bar association's House of Delegates and by the Judicial Conference
of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the company's expansion across the Southeast, Bryan
remained closely identified with Virginia. His newspapers were
leading supporters of the campaign of ``massive resistance'' to
racial integration in public schools in the mid-1950s.
</P>
<P>
   The News Leader and its conservative editor, James J.
Kilpatrick, now a syndicated columnist, advocated total defiance of
the Supreme Court's integration edicts, backing Gov. J. Lindsay
Almond Jr.'s determination to preserve separate schools for white
and black students.
</P>
<P>
   But Bryan was said to have later renounced the position. A
biographical article in The Richmond Times-Dispatch this week said,
``In recent years, Mr. Bryan and Kilpatrick acknowledged that they
had gone too far'' in their opposition to integration.

CLINTON SAYS HE WOULD ACCEPT CENSURE IN OFFERING APOLOGY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hoping to sway moderate House Republicans,
President Clinton said Friday that he was ``profoundly sorry,'' for
misleading the country and would accept congressional censure as a
consequence of his actions.
</P>
<P>
   Standing alone in the Rose Garden, the somber president
delivered his latest apology about the Monica Lewinsky affair just
minutes before the House Judiciary Committee approved the first
article of impeachment against him.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's message, however, was not intended for the highly
polarized panel, but rather for a handful of undecided Republicans
who will be crucial when the full House takes up the impeachment
debate next week. Some of those moderates have been clamoring for
the president to admit that he lied about his involvement with
Lewinsky in both civil and criminal proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The president did not go nearly that far, and there was no
immediate evidence that his remarks were persuading lawmakers
sitting on the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately following the Clinton's statement, two New Jersey
Republicans who had been undecided, Rodney Frelinghuysen and Robert
Franks, announced they would vote for at least one of the articles
of impeachment. Both said that the president did not go far enough
in his remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was needed from the president today was an admission, not
contrition,'' said Franks. ``Unfortunately, through his remarks
this evening the president continues to put his own self interest
ahead of the nation by refusing to take personal responsibility for
his actions.''
</P>
<P>
   While the president was remorseful in his brief comments he did
not specifically acknowledge that he had committed perjury as some
lawmakers had urged him to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never should have misled the country, the Congress, my
friends or my family,'' Clinton said. Quite simply, I gave into my
shame.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's apology was not substantively different from a
number of other professions of remorse he made earlier this year
after admitting to an affair with Lewinsky in nationwide address in
August.
</P>
<P>
   However, for the first time the president publicly stated what
his advisers have already said: that he would accept either censure
or rebuke from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must also be at peace with the fact that public consequences
of my actions are in the hands of the American public and their
representatives in Congress,'' he said.`` Should they determine
that my errors of word and deeds require their rebuke and censure,
I am ready to accept that.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee are expected to offer
a censure resolution Saturday after the panel concludes work on all
four impeachment articles.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also repeated his contention that lawmakers must return
to the business of governing the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must all return to the work, the vital work of
strengthening our nation for the new century,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The president is scheduled Saturday to embark for the Middle
East where he will attempt to patch up a tattered accord between
Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   A number of White House advisers, Democrats and some Republicans
have been urging the president for some time to make a personal
appeal, arguing that it was not adequate to leave his defense to
his lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   One political analyst, Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institution,
said the president was in bind because if he had admitted perjury
he would have bolstered Republicans' argument that he should be
impeached.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that an admission of guilt on the perjury
charges would make easier for independent counsel Kenneth Starr to
indict him once he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   Mann said that he doubted that ``there is anything (Clinton) can
say that will alter the course of what is happening,'' in the
House.
</P>
<P>
   The analyst said the only thing that might move moderates as the
House impeachment vote draws nearer is the realization that they
are ``pulling up to the precipice,'' of a constitutional crisis
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton's adversaries, his latest comments only reinforced
their determination to proceed with impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Whip, Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, a longtime Clinton
critic who has been leading the impeachment drive in the House,
condemned the president's latest apology saying ``this last-ditch
effort to influence undecided members of Congress is an insult to
their intelligence, and the intelligence of all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay said the president ``should end this process by resigning
his office for the good of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of undecided Republicans, including Michael Forbes,
Rick Lazio and Jack Quinn of New York and Jon Fox of Pennsylvania
remain undecided Friday, according to their spokesmen.
</P>
<P>
   Another undecided lawmaker Rep. Bob Ney, R-Ohio, was not swayed
one way or the other by the president's comments, according to his
spokesman Neil Volz. Nevertheless Volz said the congressman ``hoped
(Clinton) would have admitted he lied under oath.''
</P>
<P>
   However, several other Republicans, who had previously been
undecided or undeclared, announced they would vote for impeachment.
They included Rep. Richard Baker, R-La., Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga.,
and Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appeared to be retaining support among Democrats, as 112
indicated they would vote against impeachment, according to a
survey by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Only three House Democrats have said they will vote for
impeachment.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the impeachment vote neared, oddly bipartisan
tinges of sadness glimmered at times along the House Judiciary
Committee. A hurriedly jotted note of consolation _ ``Don't worry,
this is a strong country.'' _ was quietly dispatched in mid-debate
by a sympathetic Republican to a Democrat agonizing across the
aisle.
</P>
<P>
   The gravity of the lawmakers' action in proposing the removal of
President Clinton seemed to be sinking in. Much of the long day's
struggle over the fate of the president was consumed in the
laborious trench warfare of lawyers, with Democrats demanding
precise details of the charges they were voting on against ``the
accused,'' as one Republican put it.
</P>
<P>
   But through another grueling day there were occasional personal
truces to be seen, as if called for by the grave occasion of voting
the impeachment of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Chabot, Republican of Ohio, walked over to the other side
as the debate wore on and in the touchy-feely rites so important in
the political jungle patted the shoulder of a Democratic friend in
a private exchange of words. ``This is a very sad thing, but it's
our duty,'' Chabot later explained to a questioner during a break
before fervidly opposing his Democratic friend in the showdown vote
count.
</P>
<P>
   Some long absent grace notes were to be found even as a
party-line vote for impeachment was approaching. Members showed
every appearance of listening closely to one another, even if no
minds were changed.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin L. Watt, a North Carolina Democrat doggedly fighting for
Clinton, took a break and sat in the general audience, listening to
a Republican whose five-minute speaking allotment ran out in
mid-sentence. ``Unanimous consent to grant the member extra time,''
Watt gently requested of the chair, gaining a few minutes more for
Lindsey O. Graham, South Carolina Republican, to speak dolefully of
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``His fate is in his hands,'' Graham said of the president, then
closed in direct address to the chief executive: ``Don't bite your
lip; reconcile yourself with the law.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the partisanship on display on television in the
arguments, the mood within the room was noticeably gentler at
times, with no committee members waxing skeptical of the sincerity
of their counterparts, despite their differences regarding the
matters on the table.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman Henry Hyde's only acknowledgment of the historical
moment of the day was a light announcement that he would be
wielding a series of ceremonial impeachment gavels to commemorate
the occasion, much the way bill signings are honored at the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the hearing room, the House Rayburn Building seemed a
hushed theater awaiting the final act. ``I was here for Nixon,''
said the House barber, Joe Quattrone, cutting a customer's hair as
the hearing sounded from a television in his shop below the
committee room. ``And this is very different. Even if it gets to
the Senate, it won't pass. They should stop right now for the
benefit of the country,'' he insisted grimly after 29 years of
discussing Capitol politics at the napes of members' necks.
</P>
<P>
   Outside his shop, holiday toys were piled in Capitol boxes.
Stacks of furniture were in sight in the corridors as the winners
and losers of last month's election resituated themselves in life.
The Rayburn balcony was crammed and buzzing with television
operations worthy of a presidential nominating convention, anchor
people talking endlessly on camera in the sunny breeze that cut
across the Capitol dome behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to talk about this at all,'' said one of the
president's lawyers encountered in a sudden corridor turning,
looking almost frightened as the voting approached.
</P>
<P>
   In the committee room, Robert Wexler, Florida Democrat, was
sounding a final alarm. ``Wake up, America, they are about to
impeach our president!'' he shouted. ``If you're sick of
all-Monica, all the time, you ain't seen nothin' yet,'' he said of
the specter of a long Senate trial ``showcasing America at its most
absurd'' with ``the chief justice of the Supreme Court swearing in
Lucianne Goldberg! Linda Tripp!''
</P>
<P>
   And Asa Hutchinson, Arkansas Republican, braced the
pro-impeachment side: ``Our nation has survived the failings of its
leaders before.''
</P>
<P>
   The middle ground of censure for ``this political morality
play,'' was urged by Tom Barrett, Democrat of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, a 35-year-old video clip of John Kennedy, Clinton's
boyhood hero, was being presented by Christopher B. Cannon, Utah
Republican. He played and replayed Kennedy's warning that all
presidents must strictly uphold the law or ``we would begin to
unwind this most extraordinary Constitutional system.''
</P>
<P>
   And the first vote came: At 4:20 p.m., the committee voted 21 to
16 along party lines for the first article of impeachment accusing
the president of perjury before the grand jury. ``Wherefore,
William Jefferson Clinton, by such conduct, warrants impeachment
and trial, and removal from office and disqualification to hold and
enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United
States,'' the resolution read.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes earlier down Pennsylvania Avenue, Clinton, was again
apologizing to the nation. ``I am profoundly sorry,'' he said. But
the committee was soon into the debate on the second perjury
article of impeachment, with Bill McCollum, Florida Republican,
rapidly flipping page by page through a memo, announcing at a dozen
places, ``He lied. He lied.'' The lawmaker added, ``He should be
impeached, unfortunately and sadly.''
</P>
<P>
   The article was approved. Almost businesslike, the committee
moved on to the next article proposing the president's removal from
office. The votes signaled House members across the nation to head
here to the final debate next week on whether Clinton should be put
on trial in the Senate.

COKE REPORTS POOR FOREIGN RESULTS, AND A GLOBAL DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Coca-Cola Co. disclosed Friday that its fourth-quarter
performance was proving even more dismal than the company had
indicated a few weeks ago, because of weakening markets abroad. But
in an affirmation of its goal to gain more global power in the
beverage industry, the company also announced a $1.85 billion
purchase of overseas rights to the soft drinks of Cadbury Schweppes
PLC.
</P>
<P>
   At an abruptly scheduled meeting with securities analysts in New
York, Coke officials said they expected that volume sales would
rise 3 percent but that earnings would be 20 percent lower than
originally estimated for the current quarter.
</P>
<P>
   They said a combination of currency devaluations, higher
marketing expenses and continuing economic turmoil abroad cut into
earnings, which the company said would be 24 cents to 25 cents a
share. Many analysts had been estimating 30 cents a share for the
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers steepened the recent turn to bleaker times for Coke,
which had been the prototype of the high-flying global growth
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an uncertain situation,'' said Emanuel Goldman, a global
consumer-products analyst for Merrill Lynch. ``In some of these
markets they think they've seen the worst, but they don't know how
long the worst will stay the norm.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday was the second time in three months that Coke's
management deemed it necessary to manage the company's earnings
news in person. The 8 a.m. meeting was arranged barely 12 hours
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   While Coke's determination to be a global beverage power might
seem to be the source of its problems, the company underscored its
commitment to that strategy by announcing at the same time the
Cadbury Schweppes deal.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.85 billion price, which includes $100 million in debt,
buys the international rights to Dr Pepper, Crush, Schweppes and
Canada Dry, and a range of juice drinks and bottled water. Sales of
those brands totaled 600 million cases last year, compared with
10.5 billion for Coke outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The juice drinks and bottled water included in the purchase make
Coke's offerings a little more like those of Pepsico, which has
pledged to be ``a total beverage company.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wall Street seemed more concerned with the short-term
numbers than with the acquisition, which is not expected to help
earnings for at least a year. Investors drove Coke shares down
$3.0625, to $62.875. In addition, Standard &AMP; Poor's lowered its
rating on the company. Cadbury's American depository receipts, in
contrast, rose $4.75, to $66.125.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Coke executives said that the fourth-quarter slowdown was a
result of continuing economic turmoil in various parts of the
world, including Russia, Japan, Germany and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The company's chairman and chief executive, Douglas Ivester,
referred to Russia at one point during the meeting Friday as ``just
a mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Profits were affected as well by higher marketing expenses and
weakened currencies in many countries. Profits made in the weakened
currencies translate into lower profits when converted to dollars.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear when the company might see improvement. ``There
isn't a thing in the world I can do about that,'' Ivester said in
an interview, referring to exchange rates and other economic
problems. He added, ``There's nothing about our performance in the
last quarter or the last six months that alters our long-term view
of this business.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the stock price, he said: ``I'm not worried about the
stock today. I'm not going to retire for years. The people who have
taken the long view of the company or our bottlers or the stock,
they've always prospered.''
</P>
<P>
   One analyst, Jennifer Solomon of Salomon Smith Barney, rated the
stock a ``buy'' for the first time in 18 months on Friday. ``We
think all the bad news is in the stock right now,'' she said.
``It's underperformed the market since the market rallied.''
</P>
<P>
   Others remained cautious. Andrew Conway, a beverage analyst for
Morgan Stanley, said he projected the company's growth at 6 percent
for next year, slightly lower than Coke's projection of 7 percent
to 8 percent, without the Cadbury acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   The Cadbury purchase covers all the 120 countries where Cadbury
sells its products, except the United States, France and South
Africa. But Coke could face problems in some markets, like
Australia, where regulators might consider the combined market
share of Coke and Cadbury too large. And overall, the Cadbury
brands represent a niche market for Coke, which derives most of its
global sales from its cola drinks.
</P>
<P>
   John Brock, Cadbury's managing director for global beverages,
said the decision to sell reflected a desire to expand the brands
in a way that Cadbury could not achieve, and to improve shareholder
value. At the same time, selling the international business will
enable Cadbury to focus on its beverage business in the United
States, which has long been weakened by its dependence on a
patchwork of Coke, Pepsi and third-tier bottlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that we have a problem,'' Brock said in an interview.
``We have a great set of brands that can be more valuable to
somebody else than to us.'' The agreement requires Coke to hire the
450 Cadbury employees in the overseas business.
</P>
<P>
   The Coke-Cadbury deal represents a twist in the cola wars with
Pepsi, which had agreed earlier this week to continue distributing
Cadbury brands in the United States. In several countries, among
them Chile, Canada and parts of Eastern Europe, Pepsi bottlers
package and distribute Cadbury products. Now they will be working
for Coke and buying concentrate from their archrival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, we're planning to take a close look at every aspect
of this deal,'' a Pepsi-Cola spokesman, Brad Shaw, said.

 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kenneth C. Brugger, a self-effacing amateur naturalist who made
an unforgettable discovery, died on Nov. 25 at his home in Austin,
Texas. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   If the Purepecha Indians of central Mexico had been a shade less
sophisticated, they might have regarded him as a god, and not
because the man from Kenosha, Wis., who appeared in their remote
mountaintop villages in 1975 was a brilliant textile engineer whose
proudest achievement was his work in perfecting the unshrinkable
undershirt.
</P>
<P>
   It was because he solved an ancient mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Brugger had long been lionized by lepidopterists in the United
States and Canada as the discoverer of the wooded mountain slopes
in Mexico where hundreds of millions of North American monarch
butterflies spend the winter.
</P>
<P>
   But to the Indians, who already knew that, Brugger was the man
who brought the news of where their beloved monarchs fly off to in
the spring: virtually the entire eastern United States and the
eastern regions of southern Canada.
</P>
<P>
   From either perspective, Brugger's was a transforming discovery,
one that settled an issue that had been puzzling scientists for
generations, that touched off a stampede of butterfly lovers and
that transformed the Indian culture. Their mountain homeland, 80
miles southwest of Mexico City, was turned into a tourist
attraction. And this created a campaign to protect the monarchs'
sanctuaries from loggers and other modern encroachments.
</P>
<P>
   For Brugger, a modest man who talked little about his
achievements, the discovery of the monarch butterfly's winter home
was a satisfying twist to a life of intellectual adventure.
</P>
<P>
   A man whose mechanical aptitude and mathematical brilliance
surfaced early in his life, Brugger, who never obtained a college
degree, worked as a mechanic in his father's garage until World War
II. Then the Army saw his test scores and assigned him to the
Signal Corps at Fort Monmouth, N.J., where he worked in
cryptography and developed a lifelong interest in homing pigeons;
at his death he had 13 birds.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to Kenosha after the war, Brugger went to work as a
junior supervisor for Jockey International. By the time a divorce
led him to pull up stakes in 1965 and start a new life as a textile
consultant in Mexico City, he had risen to chief engineer for
Jockey's worldwide knitting operations, designing, installing and
tinkering with innovative textile machines. Among them was the
compactor, which compresses cotton fibers so much that when they
spring back in the wash it compensates for the inevitable
shrinkage.
</P>
<P>
   Rugger's achievements may have been limited to underwear if he
had not picked up a Mexican newspaper one day in 1973 and seen an
advertisement placed by Fred Urquhart, a University of Toronto
scientist who was seeking volunteers to help him track the annual
migration of monarchs.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1940, when he began the project, Urquhart had enlisted
3,000 volunteers who had systematically tagged thousands of
butterflies, faithfully reported sightings of their annual flights
south, and learned much about the world's only insect migration _
one that is especially remarkable because the monarchs that swarm
out of Mexico in the spring are not the ones who return in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   In a sustained and unparalleled sexual frenzy, monarchs mate
themselves into oblivion in a matter of weeks, and it is generally
their great-grandchildren or great-great-grandchildren, hatched out
on milkweed leaves from Texas to Canada, that make the return trip
for what turns out to be a lazy, celibate winter, an abstinence
that allows them to live long enough to begin the flight back north
the next spring.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing Urquhart had not learned is exactly where the
monarchs spend the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling that he had once driven through a sudden storm of
monarch butterflies during a trip through the volcanic mountains
west of Mexico City, Brugger wrote to Urquhart and was persuaded to
return to the area to search for them.
</P>
<P>
   And that is how it happened that on Jan. 2, 1975, a date that
lepidopterists hold dear, Brugger and his wife, Catalina, made
their way through a forest of Oyamel firs until they reached the
10,000-foot level and suddenly realized that the trees were covered
with monarchs, as many as four million an acre, according to later
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   As thousands of ecstatic tourists have since discovered, the
massed orange and black monarchs make a breathtakingly beautiful
sight.
</P>
<P>
   It was a beauty that was largely lost on Brugger, who is
survived by three children, Carl, of Racine, Wis., Katharine
Carroll of Kenosha, and Kenneth Jr., of Austin; a brother, Robert,
of Kenosha; three grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   A man who once came home with a new sports jacket with an orange
stripe he thought was green, Brugger was totally colorblind _ he
saw the monarchs as shades of gray.

   Whose Number to Use On Credit Card Debt? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, when the credit card industry lobbied
Congress to toughen bankruptcy laws for individuals, Visa USA and
Mastercard International commissioned a study that said 10 percent
of debtors could repay some card debt.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation, passed by the House but not taken up in the Senate,
would have required a single person making $17,900 or more, or a
family of four making $51,000 or more, to repay 30 percent of
credit card debts in bankruptcy. If the debtor failed, he risked
being pursued for the rest of his life for the full debt and
penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes a study that rebuts the finding. According to the
American Bankruptcy Institute, a nonpartisan, nonprofit research
group in Washington, only 3 percent of those filing for Chapter 7
bankruptcy can repay even a small part of their credit card debts.
Chapter 7, under which virtually all debts are erased, is used for
70 percent of all personal bankruptcies.
</P>
<P>
   The study is sure to affect the debate when Congress again takes
up bankruptcy legislation next year. The institute's study was
based on people making at least a third more in annual income than
those in the industry study. That suggests that at the income
levels the industry reviewed, it would have found almost no one
able to repay a portion of their credit card debts.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Corwin, the industry's chief lobbyist, said he was
``skeptical of the study findings,'' adding that there was ample
evidence that many people understated income in bankruptcy
filings. &QL;

   Charging It, to the Tune Of $145 Million an Hour &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Speaking of credit cards, the holiday season is when the plastic
gets hot enough to melt. Americans will put an estimated $97.3
billion on credit cards, and an additional $13.2 billion on
debit-check cards, between Thanksgiving and Christmas, according to
Cardweb Inc., a research firm in Gettysburg, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Those figures would be up sharply from the same 28-day period
last year, when Cardweb estimated $88.2 billion in credit card
spending and $8.8 billion in debit card spending. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For credit cards, this year's estimate means an average of $3.5
billion a day _ or $145 million an hour. But more than $80 billion
should be paid off by Jan. 31, Cardweb said.

   By donating clothing and household goods to charities this
month, you can get into the holiday spirit, accomplish some early
spring cleaning and take a tax deduction for this year. A booklet
by Client Valuation Services, auditors in Lincoln, Neb., lists
deductions for hundreds of household items. Valuations are based on
audits of thrift and consignment shops.
</P>
<P>
   Values for selected items in fair condition include: for men, a
long-sleeve dress shirt, $8; a two-piece suit, $50; a leather
jacket, $60. For women, a long-sleeve blouse, $10; a dress, $22; a
wedding dress, $122.50; a leather purse, $14. An IBM SX 386
computer is valued at $150; an upright vacuum cleaner at $24.
</P>
<P>
   A caveat: Give away more than $500 of goods and you must fill
out Form 8283; for more than $5,000, you need an appraisal. The
booklet, at $15.95, is available by calling (800) 875-5927.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Dec. 12:
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to fathom what gain Bill Clinton thought he could
achieve Friday in restating his remorse over the Monica Lewinsky
case while still dodging the core issue of his deceitful testimony
under oath. The disconnection between Clinton's appearance at the
White House and the legal and constitutional charges bearing down
on him in Congress could not have been clearer.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after he once again failed to acknowledge that he had
lied under oath, House Judiciary Committee Republicans approved the
first of four articles of impeachment on the panel agenda. The
article revolves around alleged perjury.
</P>
<P>
   The strictly partisan vote was a disservice to the country and
an embarrassment to the committee. If the House leaders in turn
remain so bent on impeachment that they try to block a vote on
censure on the floor, the best hope of forcing their hand rests
with moderate Republicans, the group that will determine whether
Clinton becomes only the second president to be impeached by the
House. These lawmakers had been fairly shouting across the capital
all week that Clinton needed to reconcile himself with the law if
he hoped to prevent impeachment. Instead the president spoke of
reconciling himself with the American people, while leaving his
aides and lawyers, as he said, to deal with the facts, the law and
the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton at this point seems trapped in the legal and political
universe he and his lawyers have created. It allows for contrition
and apology, but denies the unmistakable offense of lying under
oath before a federal grand jury and in his testimony in the Paula
Jones civil suit. Gregory Craig and Charles Ruff poked a bit at
this obstacle in their appearances before the Judiciary Committee,
but no one seems willing or able to push it aside.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton may be betting that the House will blink first, or he
may be waiting to make one final, more confessional statement
closer to the House vote late next week. It is even possible that
he is prepared to let the case go to the Senate with the
expectation that he is unlikely to be convicted and removed from
office.
</P>
<P>
   But his primary motivation seems to be protecting himself
against criminal prosecution when he leaves the White House.
</P>
<P>
   That is a natural concern, but it ought not to be the decisive
consideration for a leader who is expected to place the interests
of the country above all else. If Clinton genuinely wishes to move
ahead with the nation's business, he must do his part to secure an
end to this matter short of impeachment and a potentially long and
divisive trial in the Senate. He declared his readiness to accept
congressional censure, but could not bring himself to say the words
that could produce that outcome.

JOHN ADDISON, COMPOSER OF TV, MOVIE, THEATER MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Vt.)  (rl) 
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Addison, an English composer whose score for the 1963 film
``Tom Jones'' won an Oscar and whose theme music for ``Murder She
Wrote'' won an Emmy, died on Monday at a hospital in Bennington,
Vt. He was 78 and lived in Bennington.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was a stroke, said James Goldstone, a
director for whom Addison supplied music and a friend of the
family.
</P>
<P>
   Addison was born in Chobham, England, in 1920 and studied at
Wellington College and the Royal College of Music in London. Early
in his career he composed symphonic and chamber works, including a
ballet, ``Carte Blanche,'' and a Concerto for Trumpet, Strings and
Percussion.
</P>
<P>
   His interest in concert music was rekindled in recent years
after he moved to Vermont from California, where he had lived since
1976. His Bassoon Concertina was given its world premiere last
summer by the Halle Orchestra in Manchester, England.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in the 1950s, though, Addison was drawn most strongly
to theater and film, and later to television and to the idea of
writing music that helped create atmosphere and character.
</P>
<P>
   He was known for an approach to scoring that favored small
ensembles, often with single instruments being associated with
specific characters.
</P>
<P>
   His works for the London stage included incidental scores for
Laurence Olivier's staging of ``Hamlet'' at the National Theater,
and new songs for Brecht's ``St. Joan in the Stockyards.'' Several
of the plays for which he wrote music were staged in New York after
their first successes in London. These included John Osborne's
``Luther'' and ``The Entertainer'' and a John Cranko revue,
``Cranks.''
</P>
<P>
   Addison wrote scores for more than 70 British and American
films, among them ``Torn Curtain,'' ``Seven Days to Noon,'' ``The
Charge of the Light Brigade,'' ``Sleuth,'' ``Swashbuckler,'' ``A
Bridge Too Far,'' ``Start the Revolution Without Me'' and ``A Taste
of Honey.''
</P>
<P>
   When the British film industry went through a dry spell in the
mid-1970s, Addison and his family moved to California, where he
began adding television scores to his works list.
</P>
<P>
   Among his best-known television scores are themes for ``Murder
She Wrote'' and ``Nero Wolfe,'' and music for ``Pearl,''
``Centennial'' and ``Charles and Diana: A Royal Love Story.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Pamela; two sons, Jonathan, of
Hastings, England, and Daniel, of London; a stepson, Rex
Birchenough of Peterborough, England; a daughter, Lucinda Sanderson
of Paris; a stepdaughter, Sandra Stapleton of Leamington Spa,
England, and a sister, Jill Lucas of London.

   Bill Clinton and Henry Hyde, usually so astute about managing
the media, bungled what should have been their moments of televised
drama Friday. On a half-hour's notice, the president arrived in the
Rose Garden and gave a speech that echoed one of his least
successful moments during his impeachment crisis, the non-apology
apology he delivered after his grand jury testimony on Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, Hyde, chairing the House Judiciary Committee,
didn't take a breath between wrapping up a relatively minor vote on
amending the first article of impeachment and before jumping into
the historic vote on whether to pass that article on to the full
House of Representatives. The committee and the cable news channels
had been building up to this vote for days, yet it arrived not with
the weighty aura of a prophecy fulfilled, but with the unsettling
sense that a stranger had slipped in a side door when no one was
looking. ABC, CBS and NBC scrambled to get back on the air minutes
after signing off from the president's speech, and joined the vote
in progress.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-climactic though they were, these events accurately reflect
how the impeachment crisis has been unfolding in recent days, with
a sense of ratifying predictions rather than making history. The
cable channels gave full coverage to the arguments in the committee
room, but with the vote a foregone conclusion, the subtexts seemed
more significant than anything that was said.
</P>
<P>
   And there is plenty of subtext to read. By now, the coverage is
fraught with awareness of the previous months of scandal. As Wolf
Blitzer pointed out on CNN, the Rose Garden was a safer setting for
the president's than the Oval Office, with its reminders that the
Clinton-Lewinsky trysts had taken place nearby.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton spoke, looking somber and tired, his delivery had
the perfunctory, I'm-forced-to-do-this quality of his much-derided
August 17th speech. He reiterating his sorrow and added that he
would accept Congress' censure (something his lawyers and advisers
had already made clear). But the most telling moment came when he
turned and walked back into the White House, head down, ignoring
two shouted reporters' questions about whether he would admit to
having lied under oath and whether or not he would resign if the
impeachment process reached the senate.
</P>
<P>
   The unanswered questions said more about the president's
position than anything he had verbalized. Commentators had led into
it wondering whether Clinton would satisfy the wavering Republicans
who most likely will be decisive in the House impeachment vote
expected next week. Would he admit to, if not perjury, at least
lying under oath? The speech was quickly declared a failure, and
conveniently set off a new round of speculation. Did he change any
minds? Will he give another speech on Wednesday?
</P>
<P>
   If he had talked a few minutes longer, Clinton's address and the
committee's first vote would have overlapped, calling for one of
the most momentous split screens in American history. Hyde
flummoxed the networks with his quick move to the crucial vote on
article 1, perjury during the grand jury testimony. Leaping in
without any fanfare, the networks watched as, one by one, the
members voted as expected. In two minutes it was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were here for history,'' Peter Jennings said, signing off
ABC's coverage, but it didn't seem that way. History was what had
played out through the afternoon on the cable channels: a tedious,
hours-long debate about whether the charges of perjury had to be
defined more specifically in the impeachment article.

<P>
   CENTRAL CITY, Colo. _ Isolated in a high Rocky Mountain fastness
of snow and pine trees, this elegant old mining town of 600 people
stands only a mile west of its blue-collar sister village, Black
Hawk, population 150.
</P>
<P>
   But in this old gold-rush landscape, modern greed over gambling
is plunging the two villages into a municipal feud worthy of the
Hatfields and the McCoys.
</P>
<P>
   After Colorado voters in 1990 approved limited-stakes gambling,
which caps bets at $5, Central City residents discovered that many
gamblers would not drive the extra mile for a slot machine.
</P>
<P>
   People here grumble that their Black Hawk neighbors erected
traffic lights and took down highway signs in an underhanded
campaign to siphon off gamblers who make the 45-minute drive on
Route 119, the winding canyon road from Denver to Central City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gamblers are basically lazy,'' said Gary Kragenbrink, who
recently served as a councilman in Central City. ``Black Hawk is
really enjoying sticking it to Central now.''
</P>
<P>
   As the number of casinos has dropped by half in Central City and
as tiny Black Hawk has embarked on about $500 million in casino
construction, a 140-year-old municipal rivalry has erupted, pitting
plans for a ``casino road'' against plans for a ``casino tunnel,''
and coming between the two mayors, who happen to be cousins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to stay out of their business,'' said Mayor Don Mattivi
of Central City, who also said he avoided talking politics with
Mayor Kathryn Ecckert of Black Hawk. ``We wish they would stay out
of ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Central City once surpassed Black Hawk in gambling
revenues, Black Hawk has decisively taken the lead. For the year
ending in September, Central City had $92 million in gambling
revenues; Black Hawk had $258 million.
</P>
<P>
   Taxes from slot machines pay for almost the entire budget of
Central City, but the number of machines has dropped by a third in
the last four years, to about 3,000 today. Black Hawk is scheduled
to open three casinos in the coming months, and should have 9,000
slot machines by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   With a ruthlessness that the gold miners might have admired,
Black Hawk's casinos have gouged into mountainsides for parking,
digging at one site below the level of Clear Creek to create a
watertight garage.
</P>
<P>
   When Colorado banned children from casinos, Black Hawk responded
by making room for a day-care center for the children of gambling
parents, a commercial exception in a town with no gas station, bank
or grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   In Central City, residents now look enviously down Gregory
Gulch, where building is under way on Las Vegas-style casinos with
names like Riviera, Mardi Gras and Isle of Capri. Gambling has
become so popular that Route 119 has recorded the fastest growth of
any road in the state in the 1990s, quintupling its traffic since
1991, the first year of gambling.
</P>
<P>
   In a daring plan to clip Black Hawk's wings, Central City
started buying and annexing land to extend a city ``street'' eight
miles across some of the roughest mountain terrain in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The $64 million, four-lane road would cross county lines to the
southeast at 8,500 feet, descend 1,000 feet on a steep grade and
drop gamblers at Interstate 70. It would be a safer and shorter
alternative to the existing interstate link, a dirt road marked on
most maps as ``Oh My God Rd.,'' presumably for its divine views and
unholy hairpin turns.
</P>
<P>
   In a counterattack, Black Hawk unveiled blueprints for its own
secret weapon: a $50 million tunnel punched through solid granite.
Financed by casinos, the four-lane tunnel would speed gamblers 1.3
miles north through a mountain, depositing them on a road leading
to Black Hawk's busy gambling halls.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, Central City retaliated last month, unveiling maps
of land it planned to annex to isolate its road from any effort by
Black Hawk to build a cutoff. In response, Black Hawk revealed that
it had secretly paid an 85-year-old widow $50,000 to buy mining
rights along the route of Central City's proposed casino road.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a big bag of tacks, and I have just taken out a
handful and spread them out on their road,'' chortled Medill
Barnes, executive director of the Black Hawk Casino Owners
Association. With a wink, he declined to reveal if he had bought
other mining rights along the route, saying only, ``This is war,
nuclear war.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Gilpin Gazette-Crusader, a Central City newspaper that broke
the mining-claims story last week, used words like ``venal,''
``fraudulent'' and ``sham'' to editorialize against ``the
last-minute land deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The rivalry between the villages dates to 1864, when they
incorporated within a day of each other. Central City, a mercantile
and mining center that billed itself as ``the Richest Square Mile
on Earth,'' encouraged workers from Black Hawk's sulphurous
smelters to take baths and change their clothes before going to
Central City to attend church, the Opera House or the Gilpin County
courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   When flush toilets came to the finer homes and hotels here,
Central City residents knew full well that the waste flowed
downhill to Black Hawk when they pulled the chain. Because of
deforestation around Central City's gold mines, floods routinely
swept down Gregory Gulch, covering Black Hawk's streets in mud and
rocks.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Central City, which once had ambitions to become the
capital of the Colorado Territory, finds that it is not so central.
</P>
<P>
   To some, the proposed eight-mile road is Central City's
equivalent of a Hail Mary pass in football. To pay off municipal
bonds, Central City taxes slot machines at a rate 50 percent higher
than the rate in Black Hawk. But the daily yield here, $72 a
machine, is almost half the yield in Black Hawk.
</P>
<P>
   Assessed real-estate values have dropped to $48 million,
one-third less than the $64 million needed to pay for the road.
Mattivi is unfazed, saying, ``An extra five-buck drop per machine
pays for the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Accusing Black Hawk of ``taking advantage of a little old lady
with three mining claims,'' he vowed: ``They have only succeeded in
delaying the road for one year. We will condemn the right of way.''
</P>
<P>
   Caught in the middle is Luella Thomas, a fifth-generation
Central City resident who sold Black Hawk the mining claims that
her late husband stopped working half a century ago. ``I had no
idea when they purchased them what they were going to do with
them,'' Mrs. Thomas fretted. ``I love both towns. But I am afraid
that in Central City now my name is mud.''

ON THE FRINGE, CENSURE ADVOCATES PRESS ON

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Undaunted by the resistance of House Republicans to
President Clinton's plea for an alternative to impeachment, a covey
of Cabinet secretaries, business leaders and former congressional
Democrats continued their lobbying of House Republicans to make the
arguments against impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly talking to friends around the country about
the importance of this matter and how the case that's been made by
the committee doesn't reach the standards of impeachment,'' the
White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Geraldine Ferraro, the former congresswoman from
New York and vice presidential candidate, has contacted three
female Republicans _ Tillie Fowler of Florida, Marge Roukema of New
Jersey and Deborah Pryce of Ohio _ to sound out the views of House
Republican women and to urge the lawmakers to oppose impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``She asked what I was thinking, and I told her I would vote for
impeachment, and she spent the next 15 minutes telling why that was
the wrong decision,'' Mrs. Fowler said in an interview. ``She said
it didn't amount to perjury and it wasn't an impeachable offense.
Then she said, a man is a man is a man, and said that other
presidents have done this kind of thing before.''
</P>
<P>
   Other undeclared Republicans continued Friday to wrestle with
their decision.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jay Dickey of Arkansas, the only Republican to vote against
the Republican impeachment inquiry, is still undecided. But the
phone calls, e-mails and letters to his offices have intensified
dramatically in the last three days, running 3-to-1 in favor of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, Dickey said, the tone of callers has become
much more threatening. ``Before, people were calling to say, `This
is my opinion,''' Dickey said. ``Now they're saying, if you don't
impeach him, you'll get a primary challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Frank Riggs, a California Republican who is retiring this
year, is leaning in favor of voting for at least the perjury
articles. But Riggs said he has pulled back on his position after
listening to the debate of the past three days.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's influenced me the most over last 24 to 48 hours is the
notion that the vote to impeach is a vote to remove,'' Riggs said.
``Prior to that, I was favorable to the view that impeachment is
censure. I've raised the bar. That's reinforced the gravity of the
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The hardening position against censure by House Republican
leaders did deal a setback to the White House's flat-out campaign
to sway Republican House moderates before next week's vote on the
House floor. Right now, both sides say the vote is too close to
call.

MANY NATIONS ILL-PREPARED FOR YEAR 2000 COMPUTER PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Responding cautiously to warnings about the
potential for widespread computer disasters in 2000, the first
global convention of government representatives to deal with the
so-called millennium bug ended Friday with an informal endorsement
of regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   The concluding summary, issued by Ahmad Kamal of Pakistan, the
head of the U.N. task force on information technology, also
recommended that an organization be developed to coordinate
information-sharing and contingency plans.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting attracted delegates from more than 120 countries,
including some that had not set up national projects to deal with
the problem until the invitations went out. Some last-minute
attendees, notably France, have expressed skepticism about the
extent of the threat.
</P>
<P>
   The problem arises because many computers, software programs and
electronically controlled machines use two digits to record the
year, like 98 for 1998. Some read 00 as 1900 instead of 2000;
others cannot interpret 00 as a valid date. Computers could
miscalculate or crash as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates and observers said the meeting, most of it closed to
reporters, was unusually unvarnished for such a diplomatic setting.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Ball, a British Telecom official representing the
International Telecommunications Union, a U.N. agency, bluntly
named countries that had failed to respond to requests for
information about how their telephone operations are being updated.
Some who were present said Ball cited not only developing countries
but also wealthy nations like Italy and, despite Kamal's prominent
role, Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Other speakers warned that Global 2000, a group of banks working
on the problem, would begin publicizing its rankings of different
countries' preparedness in February, which could cause investors to
avoid countries that are lagging.
</P>
<P>
   Both the bluntness and the networking opportunities for
international technocrats delighted the U.S. delegation, which was
led by John Koskinen, chairman of the President's Council on Year
2000 Conversion, and included senior congressional leaders. ``We
have two years' worth of work to do in a year's time,'' Koskinen
said.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that some failures are inevitable, the group spent
much of the day discussing how nations can develop contingency
plans. One suggestion was to set up ``SWAT teams'' that could move
swiftly into the hardest hit areas with technical assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The common assumption is that most of the world is far behind
the United States in preparing for 2000. The Gartner Group, a
consulting firm based in Stamford, Conn., reported that at the end
of September, the only nations joining the United States in the
``lowest risk'' category were Australia, Belgium, Bermuda, Britain,
Canada, Denmark, Israel, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Gartner projects that 15 percent of businesses and government
agencies in low-risk countries will suffer at least one computer
failure that significantly disrupts operations.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, more than 30 countries, including Russia and China,
fall into the highest-risk category. Gartner projects that
two-thirds or more of all businesses and government agencies in
those countries will run into at least one major problem.

SHUTTLE CREW INSTALLS GEAR, PREPARES SPACE STATION FOR FUTURE
CREWS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The U.S. and Russian crew of the shuttle Endeavour
retreated from the new international space station Friday after
installing communications gear and readying the two modules for
future crews.
</P>
<P>
   Four construction and supply missions are scheduled for next
year with shuttles, and the first live-in residents will arrive in
early 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure wish we had more time to spend here to get more work
done,'' said Bob Cabana, Endeavour's commander.
</P>
<P>
   The retreat took more than two hours. And much as compulsive
vacationers might prepare their home for a long absence, the
astronauts checked carefully to make sure nothing was out of place
and that lights were switched on or off as required.
</P>
<P>
   Six airtight hatches had to be secured, each requiring a long
wait while pressure levels in the empty compartments were adjusted.
Nancy Currie, Jim Newman, Sergei Krikalev, Jerry Ross and Rick
Sturckow lazily twisted and somersaulted in the weightless of the
station's roomy new chambers, clicking away with cameras as they
waited until it was time to close the final door.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the planned objectives have been accomplished,'' declared
NASA flight director Mark Kirasich, who monitored the procedure
from mission control.
</P>
<P>
   The first shuttle crew logged a total of 28 hours, 32 minutes
aboard the fledgling outpost.
</P>
<P>
   Though now off limits to the shuttle crew, the compartments of
the new station will remain docked to Endeavour until Sunday.
Joined together by the shuttle astronauts six days ago, the U.S.
``Unity'' and Russian ``Zarya'' modules tower eight stories above
the docking assembly and airlock in the shuttle's cargo bay.
</P>
<P>
   While inside, Cabana and Ross installed three electronics boxes
in the U.S. module, completing the installation of a satellite
communications link with NASA's Mission Control Center in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The link enables U.S. ground control teams to monitor equipment
aboard the station while it is unoccupied and to send a range of
commands. The station also is monitored by Russian and U.S.
controllers in suburban Moscow, but their contact with the modules
is limited to when it flies over Asian ground stations.
</P>
<P>
   Krikalev and Currie teamed to replace a power controller on one
of six storage batteries aboard Zarya. The original controller,
which was to automatically regulate the flow of electricity
generated by the module's solar panels, faltered soon after Zarya's
Nov. 20 launch from Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   Krikalev solved a puzzling airflow deficiency in the Russian
module when he discovered and removed a blockage in some of the
permanent ducting.
</P>
<P>
   During their brief stay, the shuttle crew also removed 774 bolts
installed before Zarya's launching to secure equipment bays and
electronic equipment. They stowed clothing and a laptop computer
for the first resident crew of astronauts and cosmonauts.
</P>
<P>
   As they departed, the astronauts disassembled portable air
ducts, and removed fans and other equipment that delivered and
recirculated air fed by the shuttle. The Russian service module,
with the station's first independent life support equipment, is not
expected before late July. Its development has been stalled by
Russian economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   After a night's rest, Ross and Newman plan the third of the
mission's three spacewalks.
</P>
<P>
   At midday, the two men will emerge from Endeavour's airlock and
ride on the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm to stow a bag of tools on
the exterior of the outer reaches of the new station. They also
will inspect the docking mechanism that will accept the service
module, checking for potential obstructions, and photograph the
exterior of the two modules for ground-based engineers. They also
will work on an external guidance antenna on the Russian module
that failed to unfurl fully.
</P>
<P>
   During two previous excursions, the two spacewalking astronauts
connected power and computer data cables, installed a pair of
external communications antennas and freed another obstructed
external Russian antenna.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola Co. showed it isn't letting worldwide
economic jitters, sluggish sales and threats from No. 2 rival
Pepsico hinder its push for growth.
</P>
<P>
   In a bold power play, the Atlanta-based beverage giant is
betting $1.85 billion that buying Cadbury Schweppes' beverage
brands in 120 countries will beef up its already aggressive
worldwide expansion.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition, which does not cover Cadbury Schweppes'
business in the United States, France and South Africa, includes an
array of brands, including best-sellers Schweppes, Canada Dry, Dr
Pepper and Crush, plus beverage plants in Ireland and Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The move will take Coca-Cola's global soft drink share to 52
percent from 50 percent, further cementing the company's No. 1
position in the worldwide beverage market. London-based Cadbury
Schweppes is No. 3, behind Pepsico.
</P>
<P>
   M. Douglas Ivester, Coca-Cola's chairman and chief executive,
called the acquisition a win-win situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``These agreements will allow the Coca-Cola Co. to participate
in segments of the beverage business where it currently does not
have meaningful entries,'' Ivester said. ``The Cadbury Schweppes
brands will be a wonderful addition to the core brands of the
Coca-Cola Co.''
</P>
<P>
   New York-based beverage consultant Tom Pirko said the deal is
another step toward achieving the dream often spoken of by former
Chairman and Chief Executive Roberto C. Goizueta. The Cuban
refugee, who led the company through a phenomenal 16 years of
growth before his death in October 1997, only half-jokingly
envisioned a day when the ``C'' on household faucets would stand
for ``Coca-Cola'' rather than ``cold water.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very rational decision for Coke because it gives them
more opportunity to pursue the dream. It was Roberto's dream, and
now it's Doug's dream,'' Pirko said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes abundant sense if you're Coca-Cola because there's
one goal: to continue to build world share,'' he said. ``To build
world share, you need brands and you need systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides helping the Coca-Cola Co. grow, the deal will give
Cadbury Schweppes an influx of cash to solidify its position in the
worldwide confectionery market, where it ranks No. 4. After the
deal, half of the company's profits will still come from beverages,
but confectionery will make up two-thirds of the group's $5.74
billion in annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also will help bankroll the expansion of Cadbury
Schweppes' Dr Pepper business in the United States, where it
derives two-thirds of its soft drink sales and has a 15 percent
market share. Cadbury Schweppes acquired Dr Pepper/Seven Up Inc. in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Selling off the bulk of the company's soft drink operations will
create ``substantial value for our shareowners and simultaneously
enhance our ability to develop and focus on our strong global
confectionery and U.S. beverage business,'' said John Sunderland,
chief executive of Cadbury Schweppes.
</P>
<P>
   The deal _ made up of $175 billion in cash and $100 million in
notes _ is subject to regulatory review in a number of countries.
It is anticipated to be completed in mid-1999, Coca-Cola said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Coca-Cola's stock price dipped as much as 6.2 percent
Friday, analysts and industry insiders expressed confidence in the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schweppes has been around longer than Coke. Everyone knows the
brand name. They have the creme de la creme of mixers,'' said
Emanuel Goldman, a beverage analyst for Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Adding the new brands will round out Coca-Cola's portfolio,
Goldman said, adding that Dr Pepper in particular could prove to be
a major asset. The brand, now sold in just five countries outside
the United States, could take off worldwide through Coca-Cola's
massive distribution network, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is an acceptance of that taste within overseas
markets, then there is an awful lot of potential because of the
guzzle-ability of pepper-flavored products,'' Goldman said. ``Both
colas and pepper-flavored soft drinks are guzzle-able. They go down
easily, and you don't tire of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Dr Pepper's sales in the United States have grown on
average 1.5 times the market rate over the last 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   John Sicher, editor of trade publication Beverage Digest, said
Coca-Cola's powerful worldwide bottling system is better equipped
to grow the Cadbury Schweppes brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cadbury had a small international business. Critical mass is
essential in the bottling business,'' he said. ``Coca-Cola has the
system to help them grow.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Friday, Ivester said he's confident the company
won't face regulatory roadblocks, and that despite global economic
uncertainty, he's maintaining the company's stated goal of growing
annual volume by 7 percent to 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester said the Cadbury Schweppes brands will add volume to
Coca-Cola's system on a one-time basis, ``but then after that we
would expect our business to be in line with the long-time (growth
projections) we've talked about before.''
</P>
<P>
   Though some analysts and investors might be bothered by the
company's short-term outlook, Ivester said the fundamentals have
not changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a long-term business. We have low per-capitas, on the
whole, around the world. The company has demonstrated the ability
to build per-capita consumption of its products over 113 years,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe when you look out 10 years from now that you're
going to be very, very pleased that you made an investment in the
Coca-Cola Co. in 1998 _ in the fourth quarter of 1998, even,''
Ivester said.
</P>
<P>
   As a side note, Ivester added that the situation was similar to
1982. That's when the company's stock dropped 10 percent, on a
relative basis, from $2 to $1.80.
</P>
<P>
   ``And everyone that I know that bought that stock at $1.80 feels
really good today.

COWBOYS SHOW BELIEF IN KISELAK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Just before a Cowboys team meeting several days
ago, team owner Jerry Jones stood outside a classroom at Valley
Ranch and pulled center Mike Kiselak aside for a brief word.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was concerned about the performance of the offensive line
in New Orleans, which struggled mightily as the Cowboys were held
to a franchise-low eight yards rushing. Kiselak, making just his
second start at center, had been a flashpoint of the breakdown. The
Saints had crashed the middle of the line for six tackles behind
the line of scrimmage and two sacks.
</P>
<P>
   But Jones was coming with a word of encouragement, not
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Jones told me he watched the film and he said, `You took
some heat, but we still have confidence in you,' '' Kiselak said.
``It feels good to know I'm still backed by the coaches and the
owner. It was exhilarating.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clay Shiver, whom Kiselak replaced as the starter, took
some reps with the first team this week. Cowboys coaches, no doubt,
want him ready in case Kiselak or rookie Flozell Adams struggles
again in Kansas City tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Kiselak said some of his problems against the Saints stemmed
from miscommunication.
</P>
<P>
   On the first play of the fourth quarter, the Cowboys faced third
down, deep in their own territory. Quarterback Troy Aikman called a
pass. The play called for Adams to yell out the blocking assignment
for the right side of the line. The Superdome was very noisy and
Kiselak thought he heard Adams tell him to slide to the left.
Kiselak, indeed, was supposed to slide to the right. Saints
defensive tackle La'Roi Glover sped in through the hole nearly
untouched for the first of two sacks on Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a little flustered with things,'' Kiselak said. ``I'd
never dealt with what they were throwing out there. I think that
led to the bad snap I had, too. I was thinking about my assignment
instead of just going on my instincts and I didn't snap the ball
right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week was a learning experience,'' he said. ``This week, I
invite people to watch how I play. They'll see for themselves if
they should start worrying if I'm going to have problems, or if the
real Mike Kiselak shows up.'' Briefly Deion Sanders practiced in
the rain at Valley Ranch yesterday, but coach Chan Gailey still
said it would be a game-time decision on Sanders' availability.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Kevin Smith (back) and running back Chris Warren
(groin) probably won't play tomorrow, Gailey said. It appeared that
Smith and Warren had progressed after practice Thursday, but
neither was able to practice yesterday. ``Chris and Kevin are a
little farther away from playing than Deion,'' Gailey said.

 WASHINGTON: to call. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Republican leaders have so far been adamant that the full House
would vote next week only on articles of impeachment, not on
censure. Rep. Tom DeLay, the Republican whip, fears that permitting
a censure option would siphon votes away from impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   This strategy is designed to pressure as many as three dozen
undecided Republicans to vote to impeach the president on at least
one count, and send the charges for a trial in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   It's conceivable that if impeachment fails, Livingston could
relent and permit a vote on some kind of censure. But at that
point, with the president out of peril, many Democrats who wanted
censure as an alternative might balk, and many Republicans who
believe a censure is unconstitutional or a bad precedent would also
oppose it.
</P>
<P>
   The precise dimensions of a censure are still shifting. Several
Democrats and a handful of Republicans have discussed including a
strong condemnation of the president's actions, to be signed by
Clinton, and a fine.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the White House presses for a censure vote, presidential
aides have contacted 45 Republicans in the past few days to help
explain the president's defense or urge them to vote against
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to win over some of these Republicans, Clinton
publicly acknowledged for the first time Friday that he would
accept a censure from the House, just moments before the House
Judiciary Committee voted along party lines to impeach and remove
him from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public consequences of my actions are in the hands of the
American people and their representatives in the Congress,''
Clinton said. ``Should they determine that my errors of word and
deed require their rebuke and censure, I am ready to accept that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart refused to parry with reporters over what censure
language the president would accept. ``I'm not going to get into a
negotiating position from here at this podium,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Unmoved by the White House's defense of the president this week
and Clinton's statement, six of the undeclared Republicans _ Jack
Metcalf of Washington, Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, Ileana
Ros-Lehtinen and Lincoln Diaz-Balart, both of Florida, and Bob
Franks and Rodney Frelinghuysen, both of New Jersey _ announced
Friday they would vote to impeach the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is now clear that the president violated both his oath of
office and the oath he took to tell the truth,'' Frelinghuysen said
in a letter to constituents. ``In doing so, Bill Clinton not only
committed perjury, he violated the public trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Diaz-Balart, who an aide said turned down a White House offer on
Thursday to speak to the White House general counsel, Charles F.C.
Ruff, said in a statement: ``Failure to impeach President Clinton
would do grave harm to the integrity of the judicial system in the
United States.''  &QL;

JETS-DOLPHINS GAME WILL BE TUG OF WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ It has the trappings of a memorable game, one
of the most memorable in the long history between the New York Jets
and the Miami Dolphins. Yet, Jets coach Bill Parcells is concerned
that an itty-bitty play, a turnover, a miscalculation, will end up
leading to either victory or defeat in the first-place battle
between these two teams Sunday night in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Here was his statistic for the week that he shared with his
players: in the last seven meetings between the Jets and Dolphins,
the team that won the turnover battle won the game as well.
</P>
<P>
   To make sure they are sharp and aggressive _ and knowing that
they have a game on the road against Buffalo only five days after
returning from Miami _ Parcells put his upwardly mobile Jets
through a final practice Friday without pads. He had had them
practice in the body armor at least two days a week for the last
month. This week, though, it was practically sleep-away camp by
Parcells standards. No pads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to get guys feeling the best for this game
they can feel,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells did not add, though, that he also turned up the heat to
75 degrees in the practice bubble this week. It was even hotter on
the artificial turf under the dome.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, why not try everything? It has been a rivalry that
has often been defined by the big play and by record offensive
shootouts. Sunday night's meeting could easily be decided by a
fumble or an interception, as defining games often are.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets enjoyed that turnover advantage in their first game
this season, when they used a Victor Green interception of Dan
Marino to position a touchdown drive. It was one of only two Jets
touchdowns in a 20-9 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Even more significant than what the Jets may do on defense is
what they have not done on offense this season, which is to give up
the ball easily. Thus, the odds go down that Miami can win a
turnover battle when they face the Jets, even though the Dolphins
have created 32 fumbles and interceptions, a number unsurpassed in
the league.
</P>
<P>
   With Vinny Testaverde as the starting quarterback in 10 games,
the Jets have lost the ball a total of only 12 times. Testaverde
has produced a 9-1 record while being intercepted only five times.
There have been seven fumbles. So while Miami's defense averages
2.4 turnovers a game, the Jets' offense is guilty of exactly half
that number when Testaverde is calling the signals.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what makes this game so interesting,'' Testaverde said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Miami, meanwhile, has had trouble with the type of team the Jets
represent. The Dolphins' four losses _ to the Jets, Jacksonville,
Buffalo and New England _ were at the hands of teams that hold on
to the ball better than most.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turnovers are certainly the most significant statistic in
football,'' Parcells said Friday. ``A turnover almost always
represents a substantial loss of field position. It's a very big
play in game momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells says a team that has one more turnover than its
opposition will win 68 percent of the time. That number is
increased to 74 percent with a two-turnover advantage, and soars to
87 percent when a club has three more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any question that Jimmy Johnson is a
turnover-conscious coach,'' Parcells said of his Dolphins rival.
Johnson, too, believes that turnovers are the key factor in most
games and is noted for his getting-to-the-ball drills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been around a coach who stressed turnovers as much
as Jimmy does,'' said punter John Kidd, who played for Johnson the
last two years before winding up a Jet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had one drill in which the linebackers and defensive
linemen would run back and forth knocking the ball out, causing
fumbles,'' he said. ``It's a key to winning on the road. On Sunday,
the Dolphins will have a noisy, energized crowd. You don't like to
face that. A turnover changes the atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Jets, the speedy Miami defense will face a club that has
played four fumble-free, interception-free games. Testaverde's
interception percentage of 1.5 is third best in the league among
active starters.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins, meanwhile, have more interceptions than any other
team _ 26.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Testaverde thinks this is such an interesting game.
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   _ Jets guard TODD BURGER said he was not nervous about this big
game. ``But my wife asked me last night, `Are you OK?' She said I
wasn't eating as much, and I've had an upset stomach.'' Burger has
been under pressure all year from coach BILL PARCELLS. ``That's the
least of my worries now,'' Burger said. ``A week like this, I find
myself watching a little more film, studying the playbook a little
more.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The Jets had gone eight straight games without a starter being
sidelined by injury. But Parcells concedes that cornerback AARON
GLENN, who has a sprained ankle, will not play Sunday and that
fullback KEITH BYARS seems unlikely to play with a break in his
arm.

THE ONE WHO WAVED THE INTERNET WAND  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 13)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH HOLLYWOOD, Calif. _ As a junior executive in the
circulation department of Time Inc. in the early 1980s, Jake
Winebaum peppered his bosses with ideas for new magazines. One idea
was aimed at ambitious yuppies: Advance, ``the magazine for moving
ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Time rejected the magazine, Winebaum himself certainly
moved ahead. Now, as head of the Buena Vista Internet Group, he has
a spot on the Walt Disney Co.'s organizational chart that is
parallel to those of the heads of the company's movie studio and
ABC television network.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, Winebaum has been filled with
entrepreneurial ideas, but has mainly stayed at established
companies. He moved from Time to U.S. News &AMP; World Report and
finally struck out on his own to start Family Fun magazine in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   After two issues, Winebaum sold the magazine to Disney, a move
that started him on a rapid ascent through its management ranks _
first in publishing, later in its dalliance with starting an
all-news cable channel (it decided to pass), and by 1995 in its
nascent Internet efforts.
 &UR;  &LR;  He started the family-oriented Web site, Disney.com, and a
profitable online store that sells Disney-brand merchandise. And he
has become an Internet evangelist in the corporation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent a lot of my time all over Disney helping them
understand what the Internet is and why it's important to their
business,'' Winebaum said recently, slouched in an easy chair in
his office. With his corduroy shirt untucked over a white T-shirt,
and with his brown suede shoes plopped on the coffee table, he
looked more like a wayward teen-ager than a 39-year-old new-media
mogul.
</P>
<P>
   But Winebaum works hard to make the right impression. One former
colleague recalls how, in preparation for a visit by Michael D.
Eisner, Disney's chairman, Winebaum held two separate rehearsals of
his staff, blocking out where Eisner would walk and what people
would say to him.
</P>
<P>
   A current colleague, Michael Slade, the chairman of Starwave,
the Internet production company recently bought by Disney, said,
``The best way to understand Jake is that he's a great athlete.''
Winebaum was a ski racer at Dartmouth and now wind-surfs and runs
marathons.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very competitive and wants to win,'' Slade said. ``Two
years ago, he worked for someone who worked for someone who worked
for Eisner. Now he works for Eisner.'' &QL;

 GOVERNMENT WITNESS SAYS BROWSER SPLIT IS FEASIBLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A computer-science expert from Princeton University
says he has done what Microsoft Corp. insists is impossible:
extricated Microsoft's Internet Explorer Web-browsing software from
its Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   The expert, Dr. Edward Felten, who will take the stand in
federal court on Monday as a witness for the government in its
antitrust suit against Microsoft, was asked by the Justice
Department to puncture a central argument in Microsoft's defense _
namely that browser and operating system are inextricably
integrated.
</P>
<P>
   In direct written testimony made public Friday evening, Felten
said that ``Microsoft could have produced a version of Windows 98
without Web browsing in a way that did not adversely affect'' users
or developers of other software programs.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, in a statement issued Friday evening, said that
Felten did not actually remove Internet Explorer from Windows. ``He
only hid some of the functionality it provides, which does not
benefit consumers,'' the statement said. ``You can surgically
remove someone's right arm, but the arm was certainly a useful part
of the person's body before it was removed.''
</P>
<P>
   The government contends that Microsoft illegally tied Internet
Explorer to its industry-standard Windows operating system to
stifle competition in the market for Web browsers, the software
used to navigate the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft asserts that its browser is not a separate product but
an integrated feature of its operating system that cannot be
removed. If the company can convince the judge that Internet
Explorer is not a separate program, he will be unable to find that
Microsoft illegally tied the browser to the operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Felten, an assistant professor of computer science with a Ph.D
in computer science and engineering, said he had studied the
programmers' original instructions, or source code, for both
Windows 95 and Windows 98 with two graduate-student assistants.
</P>
<P>
   He and his students found that Internet Explorer was ``hard
wired'' to the operating system so that it was invoked in many
circumstances, even if the user had designated another program as
the computer's default Web browser. So they wrote what he called a
``prototype removal program'' that deleted some files and altered
others to clip the ``hard wire'' connections so that users could
not gain access to Internet Explorer by any means.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says that removing Internet Explorer will ``break''
Windows 98. But Felten testified: ``The prototype removal program
does not prevent Windows 98 from booting properly, nor does it
affect the stability of Windows 98 under ordinary use. Microsoft
could have produced a version of Windows 98 without Web browsing in
a way that did not adversely affect the non-Web-browsing
features.''
</P>
<P>
   After running the removal program, Felten said, he installed the
major competing Web browser, Netscape Communications Corp.'s
Navigator. ``A computer that has undergone these procedures suffers
no apparent loss of stability or functionality and provides the
user the full Web-browsing experience offered by Navigator,'' he
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   At the government's request, Felten also studied the versions of
Internet Explorer that Microsoft had developed for other operating
systems, including Apple Computer's Macintosh Mac OS and Sun
Microsystems' Solaris, a Unix operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has stated that these other versions of the browser
are completely different programs and, as such, their existence
does not bolster the assertion that Internet Explorer is a
stand-alone application that is distinct from Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Felten, however, testified that his review of other versions of
Internet Explorer ``leads me to the conclusion that the user's Web
experience with each version is substantially similar to the other
versions.''
</P>
<P>
   The court was not in session Friday, but Felten's testimony had
been the subject of considerable discussion in court earlier this
week, with Microsoft's lawyer asserting that all the professor had
really done was to delete one small ``stub'' file whose only
purpose was to trigger the other Internet Explorer files scattered
through the Windows program.
</P>
<P>
   Felten acknowledged that most of the ``shared program
libraries'' from which programs call features and functions from
Windows were ``left substantially unchanged'' by his removal
program. He could have deleted program code for Internet Explorer
from some of these files, he said, but decided not to ``because the
limited changes performed by the prototype removal program achieve
the same results.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, in its statement, warned that the scenario Felten
described would lead to a world in which consumers would have to
choose among ``dozens or hundreds of incompatible versions of
Windows.''
</P>
<P>
   But Felten testified that his purpose was to show that
Microsoft, despite its arguments to the contrary, could have
produced a version of Windows that allowed users to choose which
Web browser they wanted to install.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The lawyers who represented the first states to settle with the
tobacco industry over health care costs were awarded $8.2 billion
in fees Friday, the richest legal payday in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   The money, which will be divided among dozens of lawyers who
represented the states, Florida, Mississippi and Texas, is the
first to result from a series of tobacco cases that culminated last
month in a $206 billion settlement between tobacco companies and 46
states and five U.S. territories. That broader settlement, which
did not include Florida, Mississippi and Texas, appears likely to
produce billions more for plaintiffs' lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The three states settled their suits for a total of $34.4
billion to be paid by cigarette makers over 25 years. The legal
fees awarded Friday were determined by an arbitration panel set up
under an agreement between tobacco producers and plaintiffs'
lawyers. The panel also will be used to award legal fees from the
larger settlement last month.
</P>
<P>
   The fees will be paid by cigarette makers. The payouts will not
affect the amounts received by the states.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette makers are likely to pass on the fees, like the rest
of the recent $206 billion settlement, to smokers.
</P>
<P>
   In awarding $8.2 billion, the arbitration panel gave the lawyers
credit for taking the risks of being first to test the legal
strategy of suing the tobacco industry to recover Medicaid costs
related to smoking. And it awarded far less than some of the
lawyers had claimed; five trial lawyers hired by Texas, for
example, wanted $25 billion for negotiating that state's $17.3
billion settlement.
</P>
<P>
   But the size of the awards _ those five Texas lawyers will get
about $3.3 billion _ quickly provoked criticism from legal experts
who said the huge recovery by the states did not justify
traditional contingency-style rewards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-five percent of $1 million is one thing,'' said
Geoffrey Hazard, a professor of law at the University of
Pennsylvania who earlier opposed payment of large fees to the Texas
lawyers. ``Twenty percent of $1 billion is another thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In determining fees, the arbitrators started by awarding lawyers
in the three states 10 percent of their state's settlement. Then
the panel multiplied those figures 1.9 to 3.5 times depending on
what it perceived to be the risks and work undertaken by the
lawyers in each state.
</P>
<P>
   Under those formulas, lawyers hired by Florida received about
$3.4 billion for reaching a $13 billion settlement last year and
lawyers for Mississippi got about $1.4 billion for forging a $4.1
billion settlement last year. The Mississippi lawyers got the
highest percentage award, 33 percent, after the panel determined
that they had taken the greatest risk by representing the first
state to sue the tobacco industry in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In the tobacco litigation, state attorneys general hired lawyers
to pursue their claims against tobacco producers under
contingency-style contracts that gave the lawyers 10 percent to 25
percent of a state's recovery.
</P>
<P>
   But in reaching the three state accords and the recent $206
billion settlement plan, the tobacco industry and plaintiffs'
lawyers agreed to submit the lawyers' fee claims to arbitration for
resolution. For each settlement, fees would be determined by a
three-member panel, one member selected by the tobacco companies,
one by the plaintiffs' lawyers and the third by common agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette makers had championed arbitration as an equitable way
of resolving fees. But they quickly chafed last week when they
reviewed fee requests from plaintiffs' lawyers, and the arbitrator
they selected sharply dissented Friday over the size of the awards.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, that arbitrator, Charles Renfrew, a former U.S.
District Court judge, said that although he believed the results
achieved by the lawyers were outstanding, the awards exceeded all
reasonable limits and that some lawyers had not even keep time
records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of the three state awards rendered by the majority is
clearly excessive and to me incomprehensible,'' Renfrew wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The neutral member, John Calhoun Wells, said in a telephone
interview that the unhappiness of tobacco and plaintiffs' lawyers
over the awards indicated that the arbitration process had worked.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The situation of the three states was special because tobacco
producers had formally agreed not to argue against the lawyers.
Industry lawyers said no such agreements exist with lawyers
representing other states and Wells said that bar would be far
higher for the next lawyers seeking fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``These three states were of a totally different cast,'' he
said. ``They were trailblazers.''
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota, where the state and a health insurer settled their
cases this year for $6.5 billion, tobacco companies agreed to pay
the plaintiffs' lawyers $427 million, or about 7.1 percent of the
recovery. Those lawyers were highly regarded by many observers and
the size of Minnesota's settlement increased the recoveries by
Florida, Texas and Mississippi and, as a result, awards to those
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest winners in Friday's awards and others to come soon
from the arbitration panel are Dick Scruggs, a plaintiffs' lawyer
from Pascagoula, Miss., and Ronald Motley and Joe Rice, who work in
the same law firm in Charleston, S.C. Along with shares of the
Texas, Florida and Mississippi cases, the men represented more than
30 other states in cases against the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Yerrid, a plaintiffs lawyer in Tampa, who had helped
represent Florida in its case said he believed that the $3.4
billion paid to him and his colleagues were justified. He said the
costs came from industry, rather than the state, and added that he
would have received nothing if the lawsuit had failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted everyone to live up to the bargain,''said
Yerrid. The state lawsuits were based on novel legal theories that
asserted that cigarette makers were responsible to pay the health
care costs created by their products. To pursue the claims, some
lawyers spent tens of millions of dollars and invested years
investigating cigarette makers and producing thousands of
previously secret documents. All the cases, however, were settled.
</P>
<P>
   John Coffee, a law professor at Columbia University, said the
agreement between industry and plaintiffs' lawyers to arbitrate
fees privately was an effort to avoid potential political
roadblocks over the issue. In the congressional debate over a $516
billion Senate tobacco bill that failed this year, several
amendments were offered that would have sharply limited lawyers'
fees.
</P>
<P>
   Coffee said that his concern was not so much with size of the
fees but the fact that some state attorneys general had hired trial
lawyers who had contributed to their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need plaintiffs' attorneys but we need the process
in which they represent the public to be purged of political
overtones,'' said Coffee. ``This was probably the biggest
pay-to-play issue of all time.''

 WASHINGTON: his inquiry.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I don't want this to be an endless process,'' he said. ``I
think it's in the interest of the country to finish it and we have
tried to do our level best. And I have tried to grant every request
the Democrats have made. Maybe I haven't succeeded, but I have
certainly tried.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham, as he called for impeachment, praised a few of the
committee's Democrats. He said he admired Schumer greatly. He spoke
kindly of Rep. Thomas M. Barrett, a Wisconsin Democrat. ``He has
tried to say to this committee, `Let's bring the country
together,''' Graham said. ``What a noble cause. Don't worry, Mr.
Barrett, if we don't come together. This country is strong. We
shall survive.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the long day went on the partisanship became ever more
pronounced. Democrats fought to the end against every charge
against Clinton and they plunged the committee Republicans into
some noticeable confusion when they demanded to know precisely
which of the president's statements were perjurious.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said that in a presentation Thursday, David P. Schippers,
the Republicans' investigative counsel had ``set out in detail''
the lies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you should be able to tell me what they are,'' shot back
Rep. Jerrold Nadler, a New York Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde had to summon Schippers and his other chief aide, Thomas E.
Mooney to his side. It was finally Rep. James Sensenbrenner, who
began giving the answers, plowing grimly through the sexual details
needed to make the perjury charges.
</P>
<P>
   He cited Clinton's grand jury testimony that he did not think
his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky fit the definition of sexual
relations used by Ms. Jones' lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   He mentioned Clinton's denial when he was asked whether ``oral
sex performed on you was within the definition as you understood
it.'' He noted that Clinton conceded that ``kissing or touching of
the breast or genitalia of another person'' would be covered by the
definition of sex in the Jones case, and yet Clinton had still
denied lying when he said he had not had sexual relations with Ms.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The testimony is false and misleading,'' Sensenbrenner said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat, charged that the
Republicans were guilty of ``deliberate vagueness and obfuscation''
because they were prepared to impeach Clinton over definitions of
sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't tell us what he touched, therefore it was perjury,''
Frank said, mocking the Republicans case.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling the Watergate scandal of 24 years ago, Republicans
countered that the articles of impeachment against Nixon had also
lacked a detailed bill of particulars. And Rep. Charles Canady, a
Florida Republican, noted that it was the Republican defenders of
Nixon who had made the same demand for specifics.
</P>
<P>
   Sensenbrenner said the Democrats were really engaged in a
``clever ruse'' designed to limit the evidence that the Senate
could consider in any trial.
</P>
<P>
   But at other moments the debate reached a higher tone conscious
of history, as lawmakers quoted the nation's founders, and John
Kennedy and recalled wrenching chapters in the nation's history,
from civil war to assassinations.

GATTI GIVES HIS ALL, BUT DOES HE HAVE ANY LEFT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY _ Arturo Gatti comes to fight . . . which these
days may be part of his problem.
</P>
<P>
   The former International Boxing Federation junior lightweight
champion has always been a face-first fistic warrior, a guy who
understands what business he is in. He's in the hurt business and
he's hurt plenty of opponents while building a 29-3 record with 24
knockouts. But to do it, he's hurt himself as well, which is why he
comes into Saturday night's bout on HBO against Ivan Robinson
riding a two-fight losing streak and grave doubts that he is the
same crowd-pleaser he was when the year began.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gatti is the kind of guy who gives TV people and fans a lot of
pleasure but doesn't give himself a long career,'' veteran trainer
Teddy Atlas said. ``He's very appealing for TV, but if you're not
attached to the situation, you know it can't last. Every time you
win in a war like that, you lose something, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gatti is a game guy. He has the things it takes to be a
champion. He understands what he has to suffer to do what he does
best and he gets accolades for being exciting, but there are
physical laws you just can't beat. It's a matter of time before the
things that allowed you to be exciting keep you from having a long
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not dumb. Gatti knows the way he fights can do damage,
but it's human nature to think of the immediate rewards first. HBO
pays him a lot of money because he makes good fights. You got that,
you don't think long-term. But if you fight that way, you usually
don't have to worry about long-term because you don't have a long
career.''
</P>
<P>
   Former light heavyweight champion Matthew Saad Muhammad wrote
the same story. One day he was the gamest fighter in boxing. Next
day he was finished, a pummeled punching bag whose reflexes _ and
world title _ were gone, and nobody wanted to watch him anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Now Gatti faces the same crossroads, insisting he will change
while others wonder if such a man can remake himself at 26 against
an opponent who won a split decision from him Aug. 27 by taking all
he could give and giving back more hurt than Gatti handed out.
</P>
<P>
   Gatti understands this has become the prevailing opinion about
him among boxing's cognoscenti but he does not share it.
Considering that his ability to come back in the face of apparent
defeat is what made him one of the most popular fighters in boxing,
his contrarian's viewpoint is no surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't 100 percent last time and I still hurt him,'' Gatti
said of Robinson. ``He showed me a lot of heart that night. I hurt
him a couple times, but he wouldn't quit. If he doesn't this time,
I'll make him quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but many experts who have watched Gatti take brutal
punishment in victories over Gabe Ruelas, Wilson Rodriguez, and
Tracy Harris Patterson and in a January loss to Angel Manfredy
wonder if it is he who will be forced to quit this time.
</P>
<P>
   If so, they say, he will have been as much a victim of his own
hard-won celebrity as of any opponent, including Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more to him than just punching power, but there's also
a fine line to what he's doing. When you cross it, you can't go
back,'' Atlas said.
</P>
<P>
   Gatti claims to understand that and insists he has retreated
from that line before crossing it. A product of the tough side of
Jersey City, he has retained an actor's good looks and a warrior's
heart while paying an incredible price in pain and blood for his
unique place on the business side of boxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the only guy I know could lose two fights in a row and
get a pay raise,'' an associate of Gatti's said this week. ``Every
punch he takes, he's worth more money.''
</P>
<P>
   That's true until he takes one too many and no longer can fight
back enough to win. Then warriors like Gatti are transformed into
sad steppingstones, game guys who get beaten up for money rather
than to win. Gatti has seen enough of boxing to know that is a
story that has been written many times, but he sustains himself
believing it is not his story.
</P>
<P>
   At least not this night, against this guy, it isn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of being Rocky,'' Gatti said. ``I want to fight for
a while. I know there are people who think my style caught up with
me already, but if I want to box, I can box. When I put myself in
desperate situations, then's when I do what I do best _ declare
war. But I don't want to put myself in desperate situations no
more. I've made a lot of money because people know I'll show up to
the show, but sometimes I show up too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson is counting on that. A better boxer but a far lighter
hitter than Gatti, Robinson sees a road to victory that seems clear
to him and his handlers, who have come up with a unique battle
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's manager, Eddie Woods, has offered to take $5,000 off
his managerial end and give it to Robinson's two children if his
fighter throws at least 1,200 punches Saturday night. His belief is
that Robinson (26-2, 10 KOs) can wear Gatti down and eventually
overwhelm him with so many bee stings that the former champion's
oft-closed eyes will begin to resemble the slits of a piggy bank,
as they did the night Gatti got off the deck to knock out Rodriguez
while half-blind.
</P>
<P>
   If they're right, Woods knows, his fighter can win. Of course,
to do that, Robinson must get close enough to Gatti to be hit, and
therein, Gatti believes, lies his opponent's problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure he'll box me like he did last fight,'' Gatti said of
Robinson's surprisingly aggressive style that night. ``He opened up
a couple of times and I hurt him. This time I'll finish him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first fight wasn't me. I had a lot of problems. I was
coming off a long (eight-month) layoff (after the Manfredy defeat)
and I had weight problems. This time I was 139 two days before the
fight. I feel better physically. I'll go in the ring this time with
a clear mind. If you're not 100 percent, your mind starts spinning
when you get in that place. This time I feel perfect. I don't feel
like being a great loser.''

PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY ACCUSED OF NOT FULFILLING PEACE PACT
COMMITMENTS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN ERLANGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While Israel has frozen its compliance with recent
peace accords, the Palestinian Authority is not fully complying
with its own commitments, senior U.S. and Israeli officials said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Among the problems they cite are incendiary Palestinian
statements about prisoner releases, lagging efforts to confiscate
illegal firearms, and to cut the security forces, all of which are
required under the accords that were reached in Wye, Md., in
October.
</P>
<P>
   These deficiencies made it harder for Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu to keep selling the accord to the Israeli Cabinet, the
officials said. And U.S. officials in Washington and the Middle
East have scrambled to cool tempers and get Palestinians to meet
their obligations. As President Clinton prepared to fly to the
Middle East early Saturday, the Americans have pressed Palestinian
officials to stop any statements that would qualify as incitement
to violence and to call off hunger strikes by Palestinians being
held in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, has denied Israel charges
that the Palestinians are violating the Wye accords.
</P>
<P>
   While each side has raised contentious issues during ongoing
security talks, chaired by the CIA, security professionals have
nonetheless continued to engage each other seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday U.S. diplomats worked out procedures with the
Palestinians for a critical meeting on Monday in Gaza with Clinton
in attendance. At that time, a quorum of the Palestinian National
Council and other Palestinians are to ``reaffirm'' that clauses in
the Palestinian charter calling for Israel's destruction have been
nullified. But the Americans have not yet received Israeli backing
for those procedures.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House Friday morning, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and National Security Adviser Sandy Berger refused at a
news conference to say whether there would be a formal vote at the
meeting, which the Israelis have demanded. The reaffirmation ``will
be done through a set of procedures that have been agreed upon,''
Albright said, but she did not specify them.
</P>
<P>
   Albright urged Israelis and Palestinians to carry out all their
obligations under the Wye accord, under which Israel will withdraw
in phases from a further 13 percent of the West Bank in return for
Palestinian steps against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   As White House domestic aides continued to raise the difficulty
of the trip's timing _ with Clinton in the Middle East until late
Tuesday night when the House discusses his impeachment _ Clinton's
aides on the foreign side insisted that the trip had to go ahead
for the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Berger asserted: ``I don't think the president had second
thoughts for a second about going on this trip.''
</P>
<P>
   But senior U.S. officials conceded that with Netanyahu in
political trouble with his right wing and Yasser Arafat trying to
placate radicals on his left, Clinton will need all his political
skills to navigate what was supposed to be a celebratory visit.
</P>
<P>
   The president's special Middle East envoy, Dennis Ross, was
called back to Washington to help senior officials prepare for the
morning briefing and then to travel back with the president on
Saturday. It will be Clinton's fourth visit to Israel as president.
</P>
<P>
   Albright spoke optimistically Friday morning about the Wye
accords. ``I believe we can and will overcome the challenges we
face,'' she said. ``The first phase of the Wye implementation
process has now been completed, and it has produced real results.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's no denying that the second phase of implementation
has proven more difficult than the first,'' Albright said.
``Provocative rhetoric, violence and disputes over key issues such
as prisoner exchanges have created real difficulties. And it's
unrealistic to expect that after an 18-month crisis of confidence,
Israelis and Palestinians would build strong working relationships
easily or quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about problems of compliance, Albright said: ``From our
perspective, there is more that can be done on security. And we
would hope to see that happen. And we also believe that it's
important for disputes that have come up over the prisoner issue to
be resolved at the negotiating table.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked specifically about the Palestinian effort to collect guns,
Albright said carefully: ``Well, that process has begun, and it
needs to continue. And I'm not going to characterize our level of
contentment at the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   But other officials said that U.S. diplomats in Israel were
spending much of their time using the leverage of Clinton's visit
to get Arafat to cool the rhetoric on prisoners and to stop street
demonstrations that have led to violence.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., wrote Clinton a
letter praising the Wye accords but noting: ``Israel has complied
with her obligations under Wye thus far, but continued
implementation is in jeopardy because the Palestinians have not
followed through on their commitments.'' He urged Clinton ``to
press the Palestinians to implement aggressively their new laws
outlawing possession of weapons and preventing incitement'' and to
ensure that the Palestinian National Council ``makes unmistakeably,
unambiguously clear'' that offending clauses of the charter are
repealed.
</P>
<P>
   Lautenberg said in an interview that his concerns arose from
information provided him as a member of ``a confidential committee
I sit on,'' a reference to the Senate Select Committee on
Intelligence.

STADIUM SITE CAN BE CLEANED UP, REGIONAL EPA CHIEF SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY AND GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Mass. _ Federal officials who once warned that the
site of the proposed new stadium for the New England Patriots
reeked of contamination, declared Friday the area could be cleaned
and made a model of environmental efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The statement was a dramatic turnabout from weeks ago when
environmental concerns at the site along the Connecticut River
threatened to undo the state's controversial plan to move the
football team to a $350 million publicly-financed stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But after touring the site Friday, John DeVillars, regional head
of the Environmental Protection Agency, enthusiastically embraced
the stadium proposal, saying the contamination cleanup would be
less costly than originally thought and that the stadium would be a
showcase for new environmentally sound construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a great opportunity here to bring in environmental
design principles _ through building materials and water
conservation,'' said DeVillars, who was joined on his tour by U.S.
Senator Joseph Lieberman, Hartford Mayor Michael Peters and project
visionary Richard Fiondella, chairman of Phoenix Home Life Mutual
Insurance Co. ``If we work together we can make this a model for
environmental design and efficiency. That's one of the things we
very much want to work on with project developer,'' DeVillars said.
</P>
<P>
   The US Department of Housing and Urban Development has already
committed $9 million _ a $2 million grant and a $7 million loan for
cleaning up the extensive contamination that could run seven-feet
deep, according to the EPA.
</P>
<P>
   A coal gasification plant that operated on the site from the
late 1800s until 1951 left behind coal, tar, and other hazardous
wastes such as benzine, cyanides, and heavy metals, officials have
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although DeVillars said the 2001 target date for opening the
stadium is ``aggressive,'' he said it was not impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary estimates for the cleanup have ranged between $80
million and $100 million. A full study on the environmental
problems at the site could begin within the next two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the contamination is significant, it is by no means
unresolvable and we're fully committed to working with the
developers to remediate the site expeditiously,'' DeVillars said.
</P>
<P>
   As he was touring the site Friday, Patriots owner Robert Kraft
and his son Jonathan met with Governor John Rowland's chief stadium
negotiators for most of the day, hammering out the details of a
development agreement before next Tuesday's scheduled vote by the
Connecticut General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland, who was in New London christening the USS Connecticut,
canceled plans to attend a reception at Foxwoods Resort &AMP; Casino
for the submarine launch and drove back to the Capitol to meet with
the Krafts around 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   While it has been widely speculated that the discussions would
mostly center on Rowland's desire to rewrite a controversial luxury
seat guarantee that could cost the state $175 million, officials
said more mundane aspects of the complex agreement took up most of
the negotiations. The first item on the agenda, according to people
close the negotiations, concerned guarantees that roads, ramps and
parking lots could be built in such a way to allow cars to be out
of stadium traffic in less than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   However, Patriots business manager Andy Wasynczuk, who was also
in the meetings Friday night, said lawmakers' desire to reduce the
state's risk on luxury seat guarantees would be discussed at some
point. Those guarantees would require the state to pay the team a
subsidy if it is unable to sell all of the expensive club seats and
luxury boxes. Skeptical legislators, of which there are a few, have
criticized those guarantees as a needless giveaway and have
threatened to vote against the proposal unless they are whittled
down.
</P>
<P>
   While the Krafts reportedly want to keep the guarantees intact,
there appeared to be some ``wiggle room,'' on the provisions,
sources said Friday. And officials said they weren't a major factor
in Friday's talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really been a lot about the development agreement, which
is going to be a highly technical and detailed document,''
Wasynczuk said. ``It's gotten to the point where communication
pretty much needs to be continuous til Tuesday. So whether it's by
meeting or phone communication or what have you, we'll be working
until Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Rowland's budget director, Marc Ryan, released yet
another financial analysis of the project that contends the state
will reap between $20 million and $650 million over the 30-year
leasae period, depending on stadium attendance, the health of the
state economy and how big a draw the University of Connecticut's
upgraded football team becomes.

   TRIBE-TREATY (Victoria, B.C.) _ More than 111 years have passed
since Nisga'a Indians paddled canoes 650 miles from the remote Nass
Valley, just south of the Alaska Panhandle, to Victoria. They came
to make a futile appeal for rights to ancestral lands they were
losing as the white man discovered the fish, forests and minerals
of British Columbia's northwest coast. But now, the B.C.
Legislature and Canada's House of Commons stand poised to approve a
treaty that will give the 5,000-member Indian tribe about 1,300
square miles of land, cash and powers of self-government. ``We're

 &HT;    Eagles' offense faces big challenge
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   STATESBORO, Ga. _ The two teams playing at Paulson Stadium at 1
p.m. today took different roads to the Division I-AA semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Top-ranked Georgia Southern (13-0), in the semifinals for the
sixth time, has ridden a high-powered option offense to within two
victories of a fifth I-AA national title.
</P>
<P>
   For the Western Illinois Leathernecks (11-2), the key has been
defense, even though they feature their own All-American running
back.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Greg Hill and fullback Adrian Peterson have been
driving the Eagles' offense behind a veteran front that includes
first- and second-team All-Southern Conference linemen Mark
Williams at guard, Matt Winslette at center and Rich McGrath and
Grant Chesnut at tackles. Georgia Southern is averaging 43.7 points
a game and 379 yards on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we execute, nobody is going to stop us from scoring,'' said
Hill, who has rushed for 1,292 yards and 21 touchdowns, although
his numbers pale in comparison with Peterson's totals of 2,342
yards and 32 TDs.
</P>
<P>
   The Leathernecks, from the Gateway Conference, feature consensus
All-American Aaron Stecker, the rushing rage of I-AA in '97 when he
gained 2,293 yards and scored 28 times. But their defense held
playoff opponents Montana and Florida A&AMP;M to an average of 10.2
points and 136 rushing yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play in a tough conference, and though you get beat up
physically ... that has prepared us for games like this,''
Leathernecks coach Randy Ball said. ``We've relied on our defense
all year. It's definitely been our strength.''
</P>
<P>
   The Leathernecks start seven players on defense who transferred
from I-A programs, including end David Bowens. A 6-4, 245-pound
junior, Bowens started at Michigan, where he ranks ninth in career
sacks with 15, and was selected to the All-Big Ten second team in
'96.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Southern is worried about its defense, which has given
up an average of 29 points and 439 yards total offense in playoff
wins over Colgate and Connecticut. The Eagles will be without
linebackers Daryl Morrell (neck injury) and Larry Rogers (knee).
Another linebacker, Dante Harrow, is slowed by a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll play hard on that side of the ball,'' Eagles
coach Paul Johnson said. ``(Coach Ball) has confidence in his team,
and I've got confidence our guys. I'm anxious to see what
happens.''

LOVING, ILLUMINATING BIO OF BARBARA JORDAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   An adoring biography can still be revealing and capture a sense
of the time and place in which its hero made history.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Beth Rogers' ``Barbara Jordan: American Hero'' is a fine
read even for those who never heard of the ``gentlelady from
Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was the first African American woman to serve in Congress
from the old Confederacy. She was a booming orator, but also
somehow managed to operate with old boys in the back rooms of
Austin and Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan served only six years in the House before multiple
sclerosis forced her back to Texas. But at the 1974 Watergate
hearings, she captivated a nation with a clarity of mind and depth
of expression in explaining her vote to impeach President Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``My faith in the Constitution is whole, it is complete, it is
total,'' she declared. ``I am not going to sit here and be an idle
spectator to the diminution, the subversion, the destruction of the
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers was chief of staff to Gov. Ann Richards, another heroine
of Texas populism. She has a clear understanding of Jordan's
upbringing in a segregated Houston, her chafing at rules set down
by a strict preacher-father (and later revulsion upon learning of
his secret infidelity) and the deals she had to make to rise in
Texas politics.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly with the spectacle currently unfolding in the House
Judiciary Committee, however, the book's most valuable chapters
center on the 1974 Nixon impeachment decision. It focuses not only
on Jordan's role, but on the work of another American hero:
committee chairman Peter Rodino.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chairman Rodino determined privately, and then announced
publicly, that he would not play politics with something as serious
as the possibility of removing a sitting president from office by a
means other than a national election,'' writes Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rodino was determined that his committee would rise to the
occasion and not let the impeachment proceedings degenerate into
the kind of sordid, partisan mess that had for 100 years clouded
the House of Representatives' only other impeachment against a
president of the United States _ Andrew Johnson.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the sordid, partisan mess going on today in Washington,
D.C., Rodino made sure that grand jury materials remained secret.
He allowed President Nixon's attorney, James St. Clair, to sit in
on all closed meetings. Majority and minority committee counsels
worked in close harmony.
</P>
<P>
   The result was not an American tragedy, but an affirmation of
the rule of law most ringingly expressed by a freshman lawmaker
from Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was made an instant celebrity, and wore it well. She used
her clout to help renew the Voting Rights Act that had enfranchised
the minorities who put her in office. She keynoted the 1976
Democratic National Convention with a ringing call for national
reconciliation, and a confession of her own party's past mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   But illness began to slow her down. Jordan told no one of the
reasons and would keep the extent of her health problems concealed
until the day she died early in 1996. The reader can feel her
increased difficulty in getting around, the health complications
and the denial. Jordan was still planning the next term's lectures
at the University of Texas as leukemia was killing her.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers respects a zone of privacy around Jordan. Blessedly, not
a word is devoted to her subject's sex life. The author does put a
few things in soft focus, like the deals Jordan made with
conservative Texas Democrats that propelled her upward. But the
book is contrarian on some counts. Jordan appears as a character
witness at the bribery trial of former Texas Gov. John Connelly.
Jordan later learns, months after Connelly's acquittal, that she
was cynically used.
</P>
<P>
   One more character stands out in a different light: Lyndon
Johnson. The famous arm-twister and wheeler-dealer took a deep
liking to Jordan. He promoted her career at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   When Johnson died, Jordan reflected: ``Other people are always
talking about what they had done for me. But Lyndon Johnson wasn't
like that. He just did it and he didn't take credit for it.''
</P>
<P>
   A fine book about a tough lady, ``Barbara Jordan'' is about a
hero whose star shone far beyond the Lone Star state. America is
hero-deficient in public life at the moment. It's timely to
celebrate those of recent memory.

KRAFTS COME UP WITH POOR EXCUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Patriots have consistently paved their way toward a new
stadium, be it in the Boston area or Hartford, with the same theme:
``We are one of the lowest-grossing teams in the NFL, and unless we
get a new stadium _ and with it more money _ we will not be able to
compete.''
</P>
<P>
   We have heard this over and over, ad nauseam, for the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the truth is, the Patriots are nowhere near one of the
lowest-grossing teams in the NFL. They are one of the
highest-grossing teams in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, this writer has been told by two sources that the most
recent league-wide audit shows that the Patriots rank second only
to the Dallas Cowboys among the 30 teams in Excluded Defined Gross
Revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, the NFL has an audit for both the teams and the
owners. The 1997 season review was recently completed.
</P>
<P>
   There are two major areas of cash flow in the league _ Defined
Gross Revenues and Excluded Defined Gross Revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The DGR includes all money from network television, local
television, radio, and tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The EDGR encompasses the rest _ mostly money taken in by the
owners of the stadium: parking, concessions, advertising, signage,
et al.
</P>
<P>
   Under the collective bargaining agreement, the players are
entitled to 64 percent of the DGR. They are entitled to a smaller
share of the EDGR, as determined by a complicated formula.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are one of the few teams in the league to own the
stadium in which they play, and this has been a bonanza for them.
Some governmental body owns most stadiums and takes the majority of
the money from concessions, parking, etc.
</P>
<P>
   To its credit, the Kraft family has done a brilliant job
marketing its stadium. When they came into the league, the Krafts
studied the best in the business, Jerry Jones and the Cowboys, who
take in some $40 million a year from their stadium, putting them
some $15 million ahead of their nearest competitors . . . your own
New England Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, while they might get away with pleading poverty on
one end, the Patriots more than make up for it when their revenue
from Foxboro Stadium is factored in.
</P>
<P>
   One source, who knows the numbers, says that in terms of DGR and
EDGR combined, the Patriots are definitely in the top 10 and most
likely in the top five.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, for the Patriots to say they have to move out of
Foxborough and get a new stadium because they do not make enough
money here to compete is a farce.
</P>
<P>
   The move to Hartford in 2001 will make the Patriots the
top-grossing team in the NFL, assuming the deal goes through and
they sell all the stadium seats, as they do in Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   And to say that the Kraft family fortune would be at risk if
they stay in Foxborough, or that the team would have to be sold out
of New England because it does not make money, is ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   Factoring in all team and stadium revenues, the Patriots make
money. And when they get to Connecticut, they will make a lot more
moneey.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness to Bob Kraft, it must be said that he did his best
to stay here. He was willing to take the risk of building a new
stadium, and for short money, compared to what is being spent by
other states and cities, he should have gotten help from
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots vice president of business operations Andy Wasynczuk
offers this:
</P>
<P>
   ``We did everything we could to keep the team here. Foxboro
Stadium will not stay competitive (financially) in the future. New
stadiums are being built each day. And more stadiums will be built
in the near future. All of these teams will pass, or have passed,
what we have been able to do (financially) in Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (moving to Connecticut) is not about the present. Going
to Connecticut is about the future _ staying competitive with the
other NFL teams and putting a great team on the field 10, 15, or 20
years from now. We think this will be a great deal for our team and
a great deal for Connecticut. This is the only way we could have
kept our team in New England and kept it competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   This deal will pass in Connecticut _ and in the NFL, when the
owners vote on it. But when those in favor raise their hand, they
should use it to hold their nose, and here is why.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL has said consistently for years _ including in court
under oath, when then commissioner Pete Rozelle testified in the
unsuccessful case to stop the Raiders from moving from Oakland to
Los Angeles _ that no team should be allowed to relocate if it is
being supported by its fans.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have not played to an empty seat in five years.
Patriots fans, and businesses in the community, has spent more
money in their stadium than those in all but one other city,
Dallas. If that isn't supporting a team, what is?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Carl Yastrzemski on Dennis Eckersley: ``I'm glad he retired this
week. The timing was right. He's a Hall of Fame pitcher, and you
don't want to see a pitcher with his credentials get beat up at the
end of his career by staying around too long. When he first came
up, he had a mid-90s fastball, a good slider, and good control.
When he was with the Sox as a starter, he was fun to play with. He
had courage. I thought he had a little too much in those days. He
didn't care who the hitter was, he wasn't going to pitch around
him. He just about said, `Here it comes; let's see what you can do
with it.' Because of that, he gave up some tremendous home runs. I
used to love to needle him about some of those shots, and he didn't
like it. He was such a great competitor, but I knew the next time,
he would do everything to strike that guy out. His guts helped him
as a relief pitcher, and he had fantastic control at the end of his
career. I'm happy for him. He's a good guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Yaz on Joe DiMaggio: ``I grew up on Long Island as a Yankee fan.
My father used to take me into the city to see those games. I
didn't get to see Joe in his prime. I got to see him a couple of
times toward the end of his career when he was limping with the bad
heel and all. What I remember most about him was the great series
he had in Boston after his operation, where he just about won the
games himself. I remember listening on the radio, and the people
talking about it. Those were great days for baseball in New York.
After Joe, we had Mickey Mantle in center field for the Yankees,
Duke Snider in center for the Dodgers, and Willie Mays in center
for the Giants. All Hall of Famers.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the great Joe Cronin was near death, I was privileged to do
the last interview with him, at his home in Osterville on Cape Cod.
During the conversation, I asked him to pick the greatest player he
had ever seen. Keep in mind, Cronin played against Babe Ruth, Ty
Cobb, and the giants of that era, played into the '40s with Joe D
and Ted Williams, and managed until after World War II before
becoming American League president. He was a Hall of Famer in his
own right, so who better to judge the best of all time?
</P>
<P>
   His response: ``Joe DiMaggio. Joe could do it all _ hit, throw,
run, play great defense. And he always made the plays to win the
big games. All those years (with the Red Sox), we had great teams,
and if he wasn't playing for the Yankees, we would have been the
dominanat team. But he was the difference.''
</P>

   For those who never saw him play, here is a stat that perhaps
best sums up DiMaggio. In his career, he hit 361 home runs and
struck out only 369 times _ virtually a 1-1 ratio _ because he
hated to strike out and was embarrassed when he did. Take a look at
the other great New York center fielders (mentioned by Yaz) of the
mid-century and you can measure how great DiMaggio's ability to put
the bat on the ball was. Mantle had 536 career home runs and 1,710
strikeouts, Mays 660 homers and 1,526 strikeouts, and Snider 407
homers and 1,237 strikeouts _ all at least a 2-1 ratio.

   The Bruins' Ray Bourque on going one-on-one against some of the
best in the NHL during his marvelous career:
</P>
<P>
   Jaromir Jagr ``has the unusual combination of size _ he must be
6-3, 220 _ speed, skill, hands, and reach. He is hard to knock off
the puck because he is so strong. You better have position on him,
try to get him to move where you want to go, or he'll get the best
of you. It's a positioning thing with some of the best (scorers).
</P>
<P>
   ``(Peter) Forsberg in Colorado is the same type of player. He's
not as big as Jagr, maybe 6-1, 6-2, but very strong on his skates.
If he gets position on you, you don't have a chance. You either
have to take a penalty or he's going to get a good (scoring)
chance. When you play against these kinds of players, you have to
be very focused. Before the game, you have to think about what you
are going to do in certain situations, and how you are going to
react.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mario Lemieux (6 feet 4 inches) was bigger. He didn't look
like he was going that fast, but when he turned it on, he was
scary. He had the longest reach, and a stick that seemed 6 feet
long. He held you off and wouldn't let you at the puck. What made
him so difficult (to defend) was that he could reach right over the
top of you, still play the puck, and get a shot off.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Wayne) Gretzy is different than all of those guys. He really
is not a one-on-one type of player. He is always looking to make a
play. He is great at finding one of his teammates coming late (in
transition) and putting the puck right on the tape. You can't give
Gretzky a lot of open ice. You have to get on him right away.''

   Josephine Cashman, the goalie for the Colby women's hockey team,
has a job this year none of us would want. Colby has yet to win a
game. In the last four games, it has been outscored, 45-0, and
outshot, 303-30. Against Providence, Coleman faced 39 shots in the
first period and 83 in the game. Against Princeton, her teammates
had one shot on net. Harvard scored 15 goals and had 60 shots in
two periods before backing off . . . Matt Groh, son of former
Patriots defensive coordinator Al Groh, quarterbacked his team to
the Catholic high school championship in New York City this year
and is being heavily recruited by the Ivy League. He carries a 92
grade average at Chaminade on Long Island . . . The University of
Connecticut has received almost 200 applications for its head
football coaching job. Reportedly, former San Diego Chargers head
coach Kevin Gilbride is one of them. The major irony in this year
of complaints in the NFL is that Gilbride cast the biggest vote
against bringing back instant replay at the annual league meetings
in March. ``We had the votes we needed from the coaches to bring it
back,'' says Colts general manager Bill Polian, ``but then Kevin
switched and went against it. Then he was the first coach fired in
the league this year.'' . . . Rumor has it that CBS college
football analyst Terry Donahue is the leading candidate to become
Charger coach. June Jones, who became the interim coach after
Gilbride was fired, will leave to become coach at the University of
Hawaii, where former Patriots offensive coordinator Larry Kennan
reportedly was the other finalist.

TEXAS' CLEMENCY PROCEDURE IS SUBJECT OF CONTROVERSY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By John Moritz 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When lawyers for condemned killer Karla Faye
Tucker pleaded with a federal judge early this year to spare her
life, the judge said no.
</P>
<P>
   This week, when lawyers for two other Death Row inmates
presented the same arguments to the same judge, asking that their
clients be spared, the judge said yes.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's reversal came as other courts have increasingly
questioned the process by which Texas decides whether to grant a
condemned inmate clemency.
</P>
<P>
   Before Tucker went to her death Feb. 3, U.S. District Judge Sam
Sparks of Austin found no fault with the fact that the Texas Board
of Pardons and Paroles rejected her appeal for a reduced sentence
without a formal hearing.
</P>
<P>
   But the next month, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in an Ohio case
that inmates facing execution are entitled to at least a modicum of
due process when they appeal to the state to spare their lives.
Sparks cited the Ohio ruling when he stopped the executions this
week of Danny Barber and Joseph Stanley Faulder.
</P>
<P>
   Because the parole board holds no public hearings and its
members state no reasons for their decisions, Sparks said, it is
impossible to determine whether the inmates' rights were
safeguarded.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas attorney general's office is seeking to overturn the
stays issued Wednesday by Sparks, but death penalty opponents said
the judge sent a clear signal that the state's clemency procedures
are seriously flawed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the board arrives at its decisions when it decides
clemency applications does not give me much faith in its
fairness,'' said Cynthia Orr, a member of the Texas Criminal
Defense Lawyers Association. ``You have members sending in the
votes by phone or fax. They don't have to hear from witnesses.
There's really no telling what goes into the decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   But defenders of the process argue that condemned inmates, who
on average spend about nine years on Death Row, have ample
opportunities in the court system to escape execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these folks have been in the system for years and
years, yet they wait until the absolute last moment'' to appeal for
clemency, said Victor Rodriguez, chairman of the 18-member Board of
Pardons and Paroles. ``It's a tactic to stall the execution.''
</P>
<P>
   If it is a stalling tactic, it has been an unsuccessful one.
During the past two years, while Texas has been carrying out
executions in record numbers, only one condemned inmate, Henry Lee
Lucas, has been spared by the board.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas once confessed to more than 600 killings, only to recant
in all but the 1961 stabbing death of his mother in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   But as his June 30 execution date neared, Lucas' lawyers
presented volumes of documents _ including one for a 1985-86
investigation by the Texas attorney general's office casting
serious doubt on the man's guilt in the slaying that earned him the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said the Lucas case shows that the state can be
trusted to intervene in cases where strong doubts about guilt
arise. Critics counter that doubts about Lucas' guilt simmered on
the back burner for more than a decade while he lingered on Death
Row.
</P>
<P>
   Two state district judges have skewered the state's clemency
procedures in recent death penalty cases.
</P>
<P>
   Before Sparks acted in the cases of Barber and Faulder, state
District Judge Paul Davis of Austin ordered the parole board to
meet in public to consider their clemency applications.
</P>
<P>
   But plans for an emergency board meeting were scuttled when the
Texas Supreme Court overturned Davis' ruling.
</P>
<P>
   In April, state District Judge Mary Pearl Williams of Austin
made a similar ruling on behalf of condemned killer Lesley Lee
Gosch that was also overturned after the state appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Austin lawyer Maurie Levin, who has handled appeals for numerous
condemned inmates, has filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of
all Texas Death Row inmates seeking to force the parole board to
hold open meetings. The suit is pending.
</P>
<P>
   She said the judges' actions demonstrate the need to reform the
clemency process.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many judges are hammering Texas on this issue,'' Levin
said. ``I can't help but believe it's going to start sinking in
that there's a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But the head of a victims rights group disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process is open enough as it is,'' said Dianne Clements of
Justice For All. ``I doubt that putting everyone in the same room
would change the outcomes of their decisions at all.''

BOEING DECIDES NOT TO OPEN 737 ASSEMBLY PLANT IN LONG BEACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Boeing Co. said Friday it will keep all final
assembly of its 737 passenger jets in Renton, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   The decision reverses one made last summer, but never
implemented, to set up a 737 assembly line in Long Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   That's good news for Boeing's Seattle workforce, which is facing
layoffs and needs all the work it can get. Bill Johnson, president
of Aerospace Machinists Lodge 751, called it ``a positive thing''
and said his members in the Puget Sound area ``can meet any
challenge'' in aircraft production.
</P>
<P>
   Kedrick Legg, president of United Auto Workers Local 148, which
represents about 7,700 employees in Long Beach, had the opposite
reaction. ``It's like getting punched in the gut right before
Christmas,'' he said. ``The work force is pretty devastated.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing spokesman Craig Martin said the latest Long Beach
decision _ like the one last summer _ had gone to Boeing's
president and chief operating officer, Harry Stonecipher. The
former McDonnell Douglas boss had first decided to cut his old
division in on the 737 work, and now has cut that division out.
</P>
<P>
   The situation has changed. The focus then was on getting planes
out the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Renton factory was in significant disarray,'' Martin said
of the time when the company considered sending work to California.
``We were missing our customer commitments. We could not look
toward the future with any sense of confidence that we would be
able to make the rate increases we had planned.'' Boeing planned to
go from 14 of the new generation 737s per month last September to
24 per month in March 1999 _ and management was none too sure it
could do that.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, demand for the 737 was so strong that it was
conceivable that Renton would eventually have to produce more than
24 per month.
</P>
<P>
   Production is now under better control. Production rates have
been increased from 14 to 21 on the new-generation 737s, and the
parts shops are all the way to 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``Renton is humming along,'' said Martin. ``We're not seeing the
high shortages, and we're beginning to bring down some of the high
overtime.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's also bad news on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   The company has made its gloomy production forecast for 2000.
Though the 737 remains its best seller, production is forecast to
drop from 24 to 21 per month in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Management's focus is now shifting to costs. Stonecipher has
said the company is using at least 20 percent too much labor time
to assemble the 737. And that's not a problem that calls for a
second production line.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some incremental costs of going to Long Beach,''
Martin said. ``In today's environment, we could not justify those
costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing Long Beach will offer its services to airlines as a
repair shop to modify 737 lap joints, the company said. Lap joints,
the areas in which skin panels overlap, are subject to fatigue
cracking. Martin said that about 250 airplanes would need lap-joint
work in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Pearson, vice president and general manager of the Long
Beach Division, said in a prepared statement that his division
could get a good piece of that work, ``if we are competitive. But
we will have to be extremely cost-conscious because we'll be
competing against other organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Long Beach could be competitive within its existing
labor contracts, Martin said `yes.'
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could acheive a rate of five airplanes a month in Long
Beach that would mean about 400 jobs there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Having a 737 line would have saved up to 600 of the 6,000 jobs
Boeing plans to eliminate in Long Beach as it phases out production
of three planes inherited in its takeover last year of McDonnell
Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   During the past two weeks, workers at the former Douglas
Aircraft plant have ridden an emotional roller coaster waiting for
Boeing's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel disappointed. I feel like the union finally got its way
up there to keep the work in their house,'' said James Haynes, 44,
a 13-year McDonnell Douglas mechanic at the Long Beach plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't help anyone's job security down here. If we don't
get additional work, layoffs will be hitting real quick, and most
of us will looking for jobs at half our wages,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Kutler, president of Quarterdeck Investment Partners, an
investment bank specializing in defense and aerospace, called the
Boeing announcement a turning point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Southern California is destined to be a subcontractor and is
no longer a player in the big leagues,'' he said. ``Long Beach was
the last shot at that.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To one set of lawmakers, the allegation against
President Clinton in the first article of impeachment was a model
of coherence and sufficiently precise detail.
</P>
<P>
   To the other, it was an untenably vague word jumble. ``You've
taken an article of impeachment,'' Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., told
his Republican colleagues, ``and made it a multiple choice test.''
</P>
<P>
   From one side of the aisle, President Clinton's actions fit
perfectly the high standard for impeachment set by the
Constitution. ``William Jefferson Clinton has thrown a gauntlet at
the feet of the Congress,'' said Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   From the other side, the charges against Clinton were so poorly
substantiated that the impeachment inquiry had descended ``almost
into the theater of the absurd,'' in the words of Rep. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   As Republicans and Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee
bickered furiously Friday, studying the same facts and phrases to
draw opposite conclusions, they often seemed not merely to be
worlds apart, but to be occupying alternate universes.
</P>
<P>
   If a cow had lumbered into the hearing room, members of one
party might have called it a horse, members of the other a pig.
</P>
<P>
   But on one somber point, there was consensus. Both Republicans
and Democrats agreed, in grave voices and freighted words, that the
decisions before them were as important as any they would ever
make, and that history would sit in judgment of what they did.
</P>
<P>
   ``This vote says something about us,'' said Rep. Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., the 74-year-old chairman of the committee. ``We vote for
our honor, which is the only thing we get to take with us to the
grave.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's hearing presented something of a paradox, colored as it
was by both an acknowledgment of the momentousness of the occasion
and by intense acrimony between Republicans and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   While members of both political parties summoned the memories of
famous leaders from George Washington and Daniel Webster to Winston
Churchill and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., they drew starkly
different inspiration from those ghosts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is a vote of conscience, and I believe it is, it is
going to come down to a Republican conscience versus a Democratic
conscience,'' said Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. ``And I don't know
how to characterize that. I don't know what that means.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would suggest that one is not better than the other. I would
suggest that there is a very unique nature about this case that we
need to look at long after this case is over. And only time will
tell who got it right.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the four-hour debate over the first article of
impeachment, charging President Clinton with lying under oath about
his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, that incited the most heated
crossfire.
</P>
<P>
   The central disagreement was somewhat technical, over whether
the first article should spell out each statement by Clinton that
Republicans believe constituted perjury.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is this, a shell game?'' Frank asked. ``I guess that's
the question _ under which pea is the impeachment? Is it under No.
1, or is it under No. 2, or maybe it's under 3 and 2, or 4 and 1,
or 2 and 3, and how are you going to defend it? I mean, I have to
say, the notion _ and I hope this doesn't go anywhere and I hope we
don't bog the country down _ but I'm almost intrigued here.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., responded:
``What I'm afraid the other side is trying to do is precisely what
they're accusing us of. The other side is trying to trivialize this
matter. And this is not a trivial matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're dealing with today is the fact that the president
of the United States engaged in a scheme, an elaborate scheme, to
lie and to get other people to lie and to hide evidence and get
other people to hide evidence in order to thwart the opportunity of
Paula Jones to bring her civil rights sexual harassment suit in
court and have it properly adjudicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., offered a theory for what she
characterized as her Republican colleagues' refusal to amend the
general language of the first article of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to get any specificity in any of these
referrals,'' Ms. Waters said, ``because the allegations are so
outrageous, so flimsy, so ridiculous, that they dare not put it in
writing, they dare not write it down, because they know that the
American people won't buy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But after today, then all those who have been shopping since
Thanksgiving, all of those who thought that this was going to go
away, all of those who thought somehow it was going to be resolved,
will know exactly what has taken place.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Republican majority on the committee passed the first
article of impeachment and debate proceeded to the second, the
divergence of opinion between Republicans and Democrats was equally
wide.
</P>
<P>
   While the first article charged Clinton with lying under oath to
a federal grand jury, the second concerned the deposition he gave
in Ms. Jones' civil lawsuit, which was initially dismissed, then
appealed and finally settled out of court.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., said Clinton's denial of sexual
relations with Ms. Lewinsky did not represent perjury so much as
``the reaction of a husband and father whose conduct was about to
be exposed.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., saw it as ``an act of
wrongdoing meant to deprive another American citizen of her rights
in court.''
</P>
<P>
   As the familiar details of Clinton's interactions with Ms.
Lewinsky were hashed out anew, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y.,
sarcastically derided a theory put forward by some investigators
that a stuffed bear Clinton gave Ms. Lewinsky had been a signal to
stand firm against questions about their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the bear was a warning from the president that the
stock market was going to tank and she should put her money in
bonds,'' Nadler said.

 &HT;    Evidence mounts that big events influence survival
 &HT;    By Kay Powell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Even at the very end of life, we can postpone _ or
hasten _ the moment of our death.
</P>
<P>
   Hospice workers and doctors have long understood how patients
can hang on for an anniversary or the birth of a grandchild, or how
husbands often die within six months of losing their wives. But now
the research of a California sociologist documents these phenomena.
</P>
<P>
   David P. Phillips, a sociology professor at the University of
California at San Diego in La Jolla, Calif., says he's not sure
what the ``biochemistry'' of this bargaining with God is, but he
has compiled statistical evidence proving that deaths from natural
causes _ most commonly cancer, heart disease and strokes _ dip
before a date significant to the person and peak following it.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips' most noted research looked at the death rate of
Chinese women for 24 weeks around the Harvest Moon Festival _ when
the oldest woman is in charge _ and at the death rate of Jewish men
around Passover, in which they play the central ceremonial role.
The dip-peak pattern convinced him that people can postpone their
own deaths if they are trying to reach a psychologically
significant occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most common example is a 50th wedding anniversary,''
Phillips said. But he found the same dip-peak pattern around
birthdays and presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   Nina Aylor of Atlanta, a case manager for Children's Hospice _
part of Hospice Atlanta, administered by the Visiting Nurse System
_ says children are most likely to hang on for a birthday, a
graduation or Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``February is a real busy time for us as far as kids dying,''
Aylor said, adding that 18 children in hospice care locally died
between the Tuesday after last Christmas and the end of March this
year.
</P>
<P>
   From the findings of various studies, a pattern of death
emerges. Mortality in general is highest in the winter months.
There are slightly more suicides in the spring. People are more
likely to die of a heart attack on a Monday than on any other day.
Men face a greater risk of dying within six months of the death of
their wife.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Kriseman of Atlanta, who teaches courses on death, dying
and aging at Kennesaw State University(Ga.) and has a private
therapy practice specializing in gerontology, or the care of the
aged, considers the mind's power over the body to be nothing short
of amazing.
</P>
<P>
   Older people ``have a pretty good idea how they want to die,''
Kriseman said. ``They are focused that the end of life is
approaching, and they do end their lives that way.''
</P>
<P>
   One client, she noted, was a horse trainer who insisted he would
die in the saddle _ despite his family's objections _ and he did.
Another client in her late 80s, when told that she needed full-time
residential care, told her daughter that she would never die in a
nursing home. Within 24 hours, she was dead.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, people can hang on for the sake of loved ones.
``They linger in order to take care of the family,'' said Cecil
Fike, founder of Good Grief support groups and director of pastoral
care for WellStar Health System. ``Patients still tend to take care
of people.''
</P>
<P>
   One woman who had suffered a massive stroke was on a ventilator
and was not expected to live through the night, Fike recalled. Six
days later, she was still clinging to life. Fike advised her
children to tell her they would be OK and would take care of their
father. Hearing that, Fike said, the woman died within five
minutes. A slightly different logic applies when the one near death
is a child, Aylor said. Especially a young one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents have to be able to tell them it's OK to die. Kids
suffer longer when the parents won't let them go.
</P>
<P>
   ``A child's not going to die until they're good and ready,''
Aylor said. ``It's between the child and God. When things are the
way the child wants them to be, they will go.''

 &HT;    Some want to end the holiday hustle with simple celebrations
that focus on sharing, not shopping
 &HT;    By Eric Sundquist
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sooner or later, the irony strikes all but the most
ardent December-philes: The season of goodwill, good cheer and
jollity can really get grim.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is there more to do than can be done _ decorating,
entertaining, shopping, mailing, baking and on and on _ but there's
also a lot of downright bad cheer going around. Just look at the
desperation on the faces of drivers playing chicken for parking
places, or parents hunting down the season's fad toy.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints about the ``commercialization'' of the holidays
aren't new. But now the holiday hype machine has a fresh antagonist
_ the small but growing Simplicity Movement.
</P>
<P>
   On the grandest level, the loosely knit Simplicity Movement,
with its message of living more frugally and deliberately, aims to
save the Earth from overconsumption, to keep people from going
broke buying needless stuff and to restore meaning to modern lives.
On a more basic level, it offers an alternative way of thinking for
people who are simply too stressed out. And its message can be
particularly apt during the December frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially at the holidays, it really makes sense,'' says
Maria Peagler, 35, of Alpharetta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, David, were drawn to the movement to keep
their finances in order _ despite urgings from their real estate
agent and mortgage company, they bought a less-expensive house than
they could have. Now the idea of simplicity spills over into other
parts of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We say, `Let's make a choice about what we do,' '' says
Peagler.
</P>
<P>
   Which is how the Peaglers, with their 2-year-old son, approached
the holidays. In November, they pulled out a calendar. ``We decided
on the things that were important, and what we could cut out,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that didn't make the cut was extensive shopping,
minimized by their decision not to buy presents for adults in their
extended family, a decision that was well-received. ``Everybody was
relieved,'' says Maria Peagler. ``I was surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   In place of such traditional holiday goings-on, she says,
``we've decided to do a lot of things with our church this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Though her family has been understanding, Peagler does realize
she's in the minority among American holiday celebrants, who still
clog the shopping centers. She tried to form a study group on
simplicity in the northern suburbs, posting a note on a Web site
devoted to simplicity, but got only three inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're definitely bucking the trend,'' she says. ``I get
reactions like, `You're no fun' or `Bah, humbug!' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're quite making an impact on mainstream
America,'' agrees Kalle Lasn, an evangelist for an
environmentalist, anti-consumption brand of simplicity. Lasn is a
co-founder of the Vancouver, British Columbia-based Media
Foundation, which attacks advertising hype and sponsors Buy Nothing
Day after Thanksgiving each year. The movement still has ``a flaky
New Age aspect'' to many people, he acknowledges.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as global environmental problems become more acute, and
people feel more stress from a compulsion to buy things, the
movement will continue to gain momentum, he argues. Buy Nothing
Day, begun in the Pacific Northwest in 1992, inspires national
press coverage and ``shenanigans'' by activists around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in the history of capitalism, consumption
is suddenly becoming controversial,'' he says. ``It's the big
debate of our time. Is the American system OK? Will technological
fixes for our problems be found? Or is America in denial?''
</P>
<P>
   The message of simplicity has gone fully mainstream in at least
one place: the bookstore. Titles such as ``Simple Living Guide,''
``Unplug the Christmas Machine'' and ``Use Less Stuff'' abound.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based bookstore chain Chapter 11 held a signing last
week for Californian Elaine St. James, author of ``Simplify Your
Christmas'' (Andrews McMeel, $14.95).
</P>
<P>
   ``These books seem to be selling very well,'' says Elizabeth
Wilson, spokeswoman for Chapter 11. ``I think the simplicity thing
is really catching on.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most well-known books on the subject is Joe Dominguez
and Vicki Robin's ``Your Money or Your Life'' (Penguin USA,
$12.95), published in 1993. It promotes a less-is-more mind-set,
particularly with regard to spending money.
</P>
<P>
   The message stunned Jef Murray and his wife, Lorraine, who read
the book soon after it appeared. ``It was like being hit by a Mack
truck,'' says Jef, 38, a DeKalb County(Ga.) resident and research
engineer at Georgia Tech. ``I had to do a lot of soul-searching.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple had been troubled by a feeling that their
earn-to-spend lifestyle had become stressful and unfulfilling.
Murray says they decided ``we had way more than enough. We can live
a good life by spending less money.''
</P>
<P>
   They cut back on eating out and on possessions, moves that paid
both financial and spiritual dividends, Murray says. ``It's so much
easier on our spirits to come into a house that's not just crammed
with geegaws, doo-dads and stereo equipment piled to the ceiling.''
</P>
<P>
   Their new lifestyle left more room for religion. Lorraine
reconnected with her Catholic faith, and Jef converted.
</P>
<P>
   During the Christmas season, Jef Murray says, they tap into the
pre-modern Catholic tradition of ``quiet reflection and
contemplation.'' Instead of buying presents or decorating
elaborately, they have friends in for a potluck supper or a home
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's made so much difference not being caught up in the
holiday rat race,'' Murray says. ``It's insane. People spend money
and get aggravated. Then it's over, and they haven't had time to
take a breath and enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Murrays urge friends and families to cut back too, and not
to buy them geegaws as presents. Their rule is that if any
nonedible possession enters the house, another must leave. When a
gift arrives, it often goes straight to a part of the basement they
call ``the mall,'' to await the next church fund-raising sale.
</P>
<P>
   Like Peagler, the Murrays realize they're a bit out of the
mainstream. ``We get our share of `Why can't you be normal?' '' Jef
Murray says. Unlike their Alpharetta comrade, however, they've been
able to find support by starting a study group, which continues to
meet twice a month at St. Thomas More Church in Decatur, Ga., using
``Your Money or Your Life'' as a text.
</P>
<P>
   One member of the group is Peggy Mann, 43, of Decatur, who was
drawn to the Simplicity Movement not for financial reasons, but by
``a growing sense of wanting to live a less chaotic, less hectic
life.''
</P>
<P>
   The holidays were a particular burden, she says. ``Christmas has
always felt like this runaway train, and I just hated that.''
</P>
<P>
   Before adopting tenets of the Simplicity Movement, Mann used to
stress herself over buying impressive presents for her extended
family and to obsess over plans for getting the family together for
a picture-perfect holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, I loved to have this ideal, big Christmas,'' she
says. ``But I've had to grow up and realize my cousins don't like
each other, and getting together was always as unpleasant as it
could be.''
</P>
<P>
   Now she gives simpler, practical gifts, like her homemade
spaghetti sauce, and has given up on the family gathering,
replacing it with something more fulfilling: ``What I really like
is a quiet Christmas, going to Mass at midnight and sleeping late
on Christmas Day,'' Mann says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, I would be trying to impress people you can't
impress,'' she says. ``It takes a burden off when you're accepting
of the way things really are. I feel freed.''

<P>
   VISUAL ARTS
</P>
<P>
   Hits:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Roy De Carava at the High Museum: The eminent photographer
took us from dark, smoky jazz clubs to subways and Harlem
apartments, capturing ``the sweet flypaper of life'' with
sensitivity and aesthetic finesse.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Connections and Contradictions: Modern and Contemporary Art
From Atlanta Collections'' at the Michael C. Carlos Museum at Emory
University(Ga.): Well-curated and heartening evidence that Atlanta
does harbor serious collectors.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Shamans, Gods and Mythic Beasts: Colombian Gold and Ceramics
in Antiquity'': No expertise needed to admire the sophisticated
craftsmanship and feel the spiritual pull of the ceramics and
metalwork of ancient Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Toulouse-Lautrec at the High Museum: The king of the poster
and the fine-art print got his due in this fine exhibition from a
private Atlanta collection.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Walker Evans at the High Museum. An illuminating survey, also
from an Atlanta collection, that revealed interests and subtlety
beyond the WPA photos for which this photographer is most famous.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  East Lake community: A bold and creative move to use golf as
an engine for neighborhood revitalization.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Duane Hanson at Oglethorpe University Museum: Displays of the
late artist's tools and materials contributed greatly to
understanding the art behind these realer-than-real sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   A Hit and a Miss:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The High Museum's Pop Art exhibition offers a good look-back
at a still timely art movement. The monumental ``F-111,'' rarely
seen in totality, is a wonder. Too many Atlantans are missing this
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Misses:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Demise of the Arts Festival of Atlanta: A great loss, both as
one of metro Atlanta's few community-building events and as a
celebration of the arts.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Alexandra Nechita at Lowe Gallery. Overhyped paintings by a
``prodigy'' devalue the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Barbara Asher memorial sculpture on Marietta Street. An honor
ruined by artlessness. In this bronze portrait, the respected late
councilwoman has a face like one of the seven dwarves and poses for
eternity like an amateur songstress in a high school play. Maybe
Atlanta should give up on public art until it can choose better.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Gaylen Gerber at the High. Many viewers probably missed this
installation altogether _ a row of trees set against a white wall.
Just as well. Work so abstruse as to require a wall text just to
find, let alone understand, gives naysayers an opportunity to make
fun of contemporary art.
</P>
<P>
   THEATER:
</P>
<P>
   Hits:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Measure for Measure,'' Georgia Shakespeare Festival. It took
director Tim Ocel and the well-seasoned Shakesfest _ led by actors
John Ammerman, Jan Akers and Tim McDonough _ to bring Shakespeare's
notoriously tricky ``problem play'' to blazing life, holding up a
mirror to the sexual politics and sex-minded politicians of our
day.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Blood Knot,'' Theatrical Outfit. Atlanta theater's
version of the Dream Team _ playwright Athol Fugard, producer-star
Tom Key, guest star Kenny Leon _ reaffirmed the ancient power of
theater in its purest form. Two actors. A near-empty stage.
Burnished words, creating a world in small.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Frank Manley Festival, Theater Emory and PushPush Theater.
The astonishing range of the dean of Atlanta playwrights was
showcased in premieres masterminded by Emory artistic director
Vincent Murphy. ``Learning to Dance'' was yet another triumph for
McDonough and Akers as mature Catholics in forbidden love;
``Cockfighter,'' a raw dispatch from the Southern subconscious.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Medea,'' the Alliance Theatre. As they proved in 1996's
``Blues for an Alabama Sky,'' Phylicia Rashad and director Leon are
among the most potent combinations on the national scene,
especially when backed up by the Alliance's superb designers.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Kwaidan,'' the Center for Puppetry Arts. Ping Chong's
adaptations of Japanese ghost stories, bound for next spring's
Spoleto Festival USA, revealed otherwordly beauty from the
underworld. Center artists were full-fledged collaborators with the
New York visionary.
</P>
<P>
   A Hit and a Miss.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Elaborate Lives: The Legend of Aida.'' Disney came, Atlanta
saw, Disney conquered, selling a record 47,000 tickets for
co-producer Alliance. Sure, the Elton John/Tim Rice songs were
catchy. But the faux-Egyptian extravaganza wasn't up to Alliance
standards for emotional truth, and no wonder: It was actually a
booked-in show.
</P>
<P>
   Misses:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Rocky Horror Show,'' the Roxy. The title said it all for
this Memphis-based tour. Rocky. Horror.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Quality of Mercy,'' Alliance. It's hard to say who was
more deluded: New York critics for admiring the script or director
John Dillon for thinking the jobbed-in actors would ring true.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Kiss of the Spider Woman,'' Jomandi Productions. With some
of the nation's strongest African-American talent to choose from,
how does one botch the casting of a two-man show?
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Displaced Person,'' the Outfit. With Flannery O'Connor's
story and a stellar cast, what could go wrong? Plenty. More proof
(as in 1997's ``To Kill a Mockingbird'') that famous Southern
writers can be miserably served by their chosen adaptors.
</P>
<P>
   POP MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   Hits:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Revivals: ``Our age is retrospective,'' Emerson once wrote. He
should've been in the music business. The most exciting recordings
of 1998 were made 30, 40, 50 or 60 years ago: Bob Dylan's ``Live:
1966, The Royal Albert Hall Concert''; Dock Boggs, the coal-mining
banjo player who inspired Dylan, ``Country Blues: Complete Early
Recordings (1927-29)'' and ``Dock Boggs: His Folkways Years
1963-1968''; and neglected rockabilly great Charlie Feathers' ``Get
With It.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lauryn Hill: The Fugees vocalist, right, looked back herself _
to Stevie Wonder's utopian pop and Bob Marley's reggae prophecies _
to claim soul music's future on the defiantly, jubilantly,
sensuously autobiographical ``The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lucinda Williams: Some six years _ a pop eon _ in the making
and unmaking, the songwriter's ``Car Wheels on a Gravel Road''
boasted the kind of mature, complicated emotional perspectives
undervalued in a pop world owned and managed by Spice Girls and
Hanson fans.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Homegrown: Local singer-songwriter Shawn Mullins (left) was
the year's Cinderella story, scoring a six-figure deal with
Columbia and critics' accolades for his ninth album, ``Soul's
Core.'' Other Atlanta artists did strong work as well, across a
broad range of genres. OutKast, UltraBabyfat, Cat Power, RockaTeens
and Goodie Mob, among others, emphasized the growth of a city where
a few years ago there was no identifiable ``sound'' at all.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  R.E.M.: When drummer Bill Berry opted out of rock 'n' roll for
life on his farm, the Athens supergroup could have folded. Instead,
it made the risky ``Up,'' a flawed but often richly beautiful song
cycle.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Downtown venues: You win some, you lose some. The Omni's
demolished, the Arts Festival of Atlanta is history, Underground
Atlanta's in trouble and yet . . . downtown is rocking. The
Tabernacle, a newly anointed hot spot in its post-House of Blues
incarnation, was the missing link in the city's concert hall
formula. See also: the Rialto Center for the Performing Arts.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Atlanta's jazz scene: Better than it used to be. And events
like the National Black Arts Festival's international jazz summit;
concerts by David S. Ware, Steve Lacy, Jemeel Moondoc, Butch
Morris, Nicholas Payton, Tommy Flanagan, Gerry Hemingway, Herbie
Hancock, the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra; concert series at the
Rialto and Spivey Hall; and improv evenings at Dottie's and the
Silver Ceiling meant there was always something to look forward to.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Wide Open Spaces,'' the Dixie Chicks: They look like
dime-store versions of Madonna, but the Chicks had Nashville
clucking this year with this platinum CD delivering a wide load of
down-home, fiddle-based country.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``High Mileage,'' Alan Jackson: The lanky Newnan native
single-handedly resurrected the low, phone-sex growl of the late
Conway Twitty with his unexpected hot-hot-hot single ``I'll Go on
Loving You.'' Country rap at its best.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``I'm Alright,'' Jo Dee Messina: With her big red hair and
tight black leathers, Messina looks like something out of ``Tarzan
and the Leopard Women.'' But her voice is as powerful as her looks.
She's proven she's a master of the hit single, with tunes like
``Bye Bye.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Crown of Jewels,'' Randy Scruggs: Nashville's most talented
picker returns to his family roots (he's the son of bluegrass
legend Earl Scruggs) on an album packed with some of the best
musical/vocal collaborations (Trisha Yearwood, Emmylou Harris and
Iris Dement) of the year.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Aquemini,'' Outkast: Atlanta's dynamic rap duo came up with
this genre's album of the year by applying as much thought to its
danceable political statements as to its partying.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``R.,'' R. Kelly: Yes, a double CD was a bit much, but song
after song Kelly proved that he can pen rhythm-and-blues like none
of his peers.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Hymns,'' Corey Glover: The voice in Living Colour that
revealed rocks' R&AMP;B roots returned and affirmed that R&AMP;B can rock.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Connected,'' Family Stand: The kind of funk, improvisation
and soul that Prince, Sly Stone and Stevie Wonder used to provide.
</P>
<P>
   Misses:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Courtney Love: Dig those prefab, air-brushed guitar hooks, but
``Celebrity Skin,'' Love and her band Hole's attempt to gate-crash
the modern-rock marketplace, was a lame shot at selling out.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Marilyn Manson: Sure, you loved the video. Everybody loved the
video. But why do you think they call it ``The Dope Show''?
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Puff Daddy as Will and Idea: Can we pull the plug on the
karaoke machine?
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  White Rockers Who Insist on Rapping and Are Not the Beastie
Boys: It may only be a truism that white people have no culture,
but melanin envy is no excuse for 311, Barenaked Ladies and all
ska/punk/metal acts hailing from Southern California who mistakenly
throw down with the Hip-Hop Nation.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Swing: Boy, that Brian Setzer sure knows how to surf a trend.
Further proof that rock is dead.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Come on Over,'' Shania Twain: Has anybody noticed that the
single ``Honey, I'm Home'' is a near-exact remake of Def Leppard's
``Pour Some Sugar on Me''? Guess not. The second CD from the
Canadian went double platinum.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Jewel: OK, maybe those white rappers aren't so bad, after all.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Double Live,'' Garth Brooks: Much too young to feel this
damn gold. Brooks' shtick is wearing thin as his bank account
grows. The pre-superstardom tunes are alive, but the rest is just
the sound of the cash register ringing.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Can-I-Bus,'' Canibus: Canibus built up a pretty impressive
score card with rap singles ``How Come?'' and ``Second Round
Knockout,'' but he hit the mat quick when his debut album revealed
him to be a loud lightweight.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Order in the Court,'' Queen Latifah: Her contributions to
the ``Living Out Loud'' soundtrack attest to the moving vocalist
she's become, while this comeback after a five-year absence was
hardly a reflection of the gifted rapper she once was.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Embrya,'' Maxwell: His sensual, well-thought-out debut and
must-have ``live'' album offered no indication he would return with
this beautiful nothing.

and the worst _ of the year.

<TEXT>
<P>
   1998 HITS and MISSES:
</P>
<P>
   MOVIES
</P>
<P>
   Hits
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Saving Private Ryan.'' Steven Spielberg's WWII epic. An
astonishing achievement, if only for its first-30-minutes Omaha
Beach sequence.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Happiness.'' Todd Solondz's controversial film about the
pursuit of love in the alienated '90s. It manages to balance black
comedy with topics like pedophilia without losing sympathy for its
characters.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``There's Something About Mary.'' The sickest and funniest
film of the year (starring Cameron Diaz, left), and the first to
suggest '98 would be the year of body-fluid humor (see
``Happiness,'' above).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``A Bug's Life.'' Another visually astonishing, wittily
scripted wonder from the computer animation company Pixar (right).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Butcher Boy.'' Neil Jordan gets inside the head of a boy
psychopath in this deceptively cheerful, terrifying coming-of-age
tale.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Truman Show.'' Peter Weir's peculiarly moving
comedy-drama about a fellow (Jim Carrey, right) who finds out his
entire life is a documentary.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Chambermaid.'' A melancholy French meditation on the
similarities of making love and making fiction. A surprising change
of pace for raucous Spanish director Bigas Luna.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Dark City.'' This elegant sci-fi flick created an entire
noir world of retro vamps and Nosferatu-like aliens. An instant
cult classic from director Alex Proyas.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Gods and Monsters.'' Ian McKellen dazzles as the fading gay
director James Whale, whose flirtation with yard boy Brendan Fraser
proves to be more complex than it seems.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Life Is Beautiful.'' Director-star Roberto Benigni plays an
Italian Jew who convinces his young son that their time in a
concentration camp is actually a game. The movie turns out to be as
moving as its premise is risky.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Living Out Loud.'' A smart romantic comedy for adults,
starring Holly Hunter and Danny DeVito as two New Yorkers looking
for a second act. Writer Richard LaGravenese's directorial debut
understands that happily-ever-after means many things.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Out of Sight.'' Lawbreaker George Clooney and sheriff
Jennifer Lopez meet cute in Steven Soderbergh's sexy, savvy Elmore
Leonard adaptation.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``PI.'' A low-budget indie film that ties science, religion,
millennial fever and personal madness into a hypnotic, eerie
vision.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Your Friends and Neighbors.'' Neil LaBute fused modern
affairs with Restoration venom in his fiendish follow-up to ``In
the Company of Men.'' Ruthlessly truthful, painfully hilarious.
</P>
<P>
   Misses
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The afterlife. ``City of Angels'' (starring Nicolas Cage and
Meg Ryan, above right) was undone by its So Cal, eat-a-pear
dopiness. ``What Dreams May Come'' proved that Robin Williams
should have his jaw wired to keep from ``acting'' so much with it.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Universal Pictures. ``Meet Joe Black'' and ``Babe: Pig in the
City'' cost $90 million each, and aren't performing well, while the
studio's sharp ``Out of Sight'' largely went unseen. Oh, one more
thing: It was their great idea to remake ``Psycho.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Antz.'' DreamWorks rushed to beat ``A Bug's Life'' to the
box office. They should have taken their time, polished the script
and tweaked the animation.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Meryl Streep. The best actress we have, she keeps shining in
terribly drab movies (``One True Thing,'' ``Dancing at Lughnasa'').
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Snake Eyes.'' With Brian De Palma at his chilliest, Nicolas
Cage acting on over-the-top autopilot and Gary Sinise recycling his
bad-guy-masquerading-as-good from ``Ransom.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``American History X.'' Who cares whether Tony Kaye or Edward
Norton had final cut? The movie is a preach-to-the-converted After
School Special.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Simon Birch.'' There's a very good reason novelist John
Irving insisted the main character's name be changed in this
painfully saccharine version of his ``A Prayer for Owen Meany.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Michael Keaton. How do you commit career suicide? Star in
``Desperate Measures'' and ``Jack Frost'' in the same year.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Beloved.'' Despite the can't-miss combo of Toni Morrison,
Oprah Winfrey (left) and Jonathan Demme, the turgid result proved
that good intentions are just as bad for filmmaking as for
road-paving.
</P>
<P>
   BOOKS
</P>
<P>
   Hits
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Summer of Deliverance: A Memoir of Father and Son'' by
Christopher Dickey (right). The talented son of poet James Dickey
comes to terms with his father's flawed genius.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The big time: Authors and publishers apparently are taking
note of an ever-growing market in metro Atlanta. This year, readers
had chances to hear and/or meet literary luminaries including Tom
Wolfe, John Updike, Toni Morrison, Wendy Wasserstein, Reynolds
Price, Alice Walker, John Edgar Wideman, Fannie Flagg, Nathan
McCall, Ntozake Shange, Maya Angelou and many others.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Atlanta Jewish Community Center Book Festival: Begun in
1992 as a little five-day event, it's Atlanta's only real literary
festival, and it continues to impress.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Pearl Cleage: The Atlanta playwright's first novel, ``What
Looks Like Crazy on an Ordinary Day,'' was picked for Oprah's Book
Club, catapulting her onto the best-seller lists.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A Pulitzer winner: Edward J. Larson, a professor at the
University of Georgia, wins the Pulitzer Prize for history for
``Summer for the Gods: The Scopes Trial and America's Continuing
Debate over Science and Religion.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Book TV'': C-SPAN chairman Brian Lamb launches ``Book TV''
on C-SPAN2, featuring discussions with nonfiction authors, tours of
unique bookstores and libraries, drop-ins on book discussion groups
and reports from book fairs around the country.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Charming Billy'' by Alice McDermott. This quiet,
unpretentious story of quiet, unpretentious people earned McDermott
some long overdue notice, not to mention the National Book Award
for fiction.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Poisonwood Bible'' by Barbara Kingsolver. A giant-size,
revisionist ``Heart of Darkness,'' this is Kingsolver's magnum
opus.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Ship of Gold in the Deep Blue Sea'' by Gary Kinder. A truly
fascinating tale of the first successful deep-water ocean salvage
operation, this is the great adventure story of the year.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Healing'' by Gayl Jones. After a 20-year absence from
the literary scene, Jones came back with a vengeance _ with her
trademark violence and tragedy, but newly tempered with humor and a
touch of faith.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Freedomland'' by Richard Price. In this thriller inspired by
the horrific case of Susan Smith _ the Union, S.C., woman who sent
her two young sons to a watery death _ Price captures the racial
politics and media madness of our times.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Slaves in the Family'' by Edward Ball. The Savannah native's
painstakingly researched story of his family's slaveholding past
and his poignant attempts at reconciliation shed new light on the
complex legacy of slavery in the South _ and won the National Book
Award for nonfiction.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Birthday Letters'' by Ted Hughes. Thirty-five years after
the death of his wife, Sylvia Plath, this volume of his responses
to her rage warrants mention, if for no other reason than it's the
first book of poetry in years to make the best-seller lists.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Lindbergh'' by A. Scott Berg. Just when you thought you had
read every possible take on the life of this celebrity _ the first
superstar in a century of superstars _ Berg writes the definitive
biography.
</P>
<P>
   A Hit and a Miss:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``A Man in Full'' by Tom Wolfe. Love him or hate him, you
cannot ignore him or the impact this book had on the literary world
this year. But . . . after waiting 11 years for a novel by the
father of New Journalism, readers rightly expected more than a big
book _ they wanted a great one, and this isn't it.
</P>
<P>
   Misses:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``By the Light of My Father's Smile'' by Alice Walker (right).
Walker's talent is undeniable and her activism well-intentioned,
but her relentless New Age sermonizing is making her fiction
impossible to get through.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Bridget Jones's Diary'' by Helen Fielding. Far too many
people spent far too much time trying to pump up this book _ ``one
of the most stinging indictments of feminism to come along in a
while,'' one critic wrote _ when the truth is, it's a silly little
quick read. Why all the fuss?
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Most Wanted'' by Jacquelyn Mitchard. Mitchard's first
novel, ``The Deep End of the Ocean,'' was the inaugural pick for
Oprah's Book Club, making it an instant best seller and thrusting
her into the literary spotlight. Maybe the pressure was too much.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Starr Report. No comment.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  And the year's biggest miss: The Modern Library's wildly
unpopular list of the 100 best novels of the century. Obviously,
these judges have not read anything at all since 1950.

 &HT;    An odd year, with bad taste up to no good
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If 1998 needs a totem to tell future scholars what
really mattered in American culture this year, it may take a coin
toss to decide what goes in the time capsule.
</P>
<P>
   Blue dress from the Gap or a videotape of uncensored excerpts
from ``Jerry Springer''? A dab of that mystery hair gel from
``There's Something About Mary'' or a stack of autographed
transcripts from Kenneth Starr? From the reel to the surreal, bad
taste was a consistent theme in popular life and media. An ongoing
explosion of Internet technology made everyone a potential porn
star, every dream home the set of a do-it-yourself ``Truman Show.''
Even the Oval Office was not immune. Especially the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, you had heroes like Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire slugging
for history's horizon, and 77-year-old John Glenn making a return
rendezvous with the heavens, but, mostly, it felt like a year
secretly scripted by Beavis and Butt-head. And, as that
pseudo-hermaphroditic free speech advocate Marilyn Manson reminded
us, ``We're all stars in the Dope Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that the white-trashing of America is necessarily a Very Bad
Thing. There's something kind of kicky about a national
bottom-feeding frenzy. For one, it's democratic. People have more
to say to each other. And it's funny. Weird funny. Ha-ha funny.
Gross-out funny. Glad-it's-not-me funny.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood, rising to the occasion, reflected the trend most
vividly. Bust-out hits ``There's Something About Mary'' and ``The
Waterboy'' somehow made scatalogical humor oddly sweet and
sentimental. Meanwhile, the terminally dysfunctional family in
indie filmmaker Todd Solondz's ``Happiness'' simply made you
relieved to be on the other side of the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the republic seemed to be sinking like James Cameron's
``Titanic,'' the economy kept spirits afloat. An abiding theme
could have been written by Puff Daddy: It's all about the
Benjamins, stupid. And the hip-hop impresario, crisp as one of
those $100 bills he sang about, ought to know. As rock music
continued its slow fade _ except as background music for car
commercials _ rap increasingly dominated the pop charts, confirming
a major cultural shift. Fugees vocalist Lauryn Hill took the high
ground on her righteous solo debut, ``The Miseducation of Lauryn
Hill,'' sharing a spiritual vibe with such non-rapping soul sisters
as Alanis Morissette, Jewel and Madonna (whose techno-pulsed ``Ray
of Light'' appropriated two trends at once: electronica and Hindu
chic). New star Jay-Z borrowed a sample from Broadway's ``Annie''
to offer a graphic depiction of a ``Hard Knock Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Down in New Orleans, rapper-mogul Master P turned his No Limit
Records into a production powerhouse, groaning and grunting over
heavy beats. Can you say ``Uhhhhhhhh?'' While he became rap's new
``ghetto hero,'' Atlanta-based artists Outkast and Goodie Mob
offered listeners inventive relief from Puff'n'Fluff radio
redundancy.
</P>
<P>
   Such vibrant output wasn't the only lightning rod drawing
attention to Atlanta, of course, as the city became part of the
year's major publishing event: Tom Wolfe's mega-hyped ``A Man in
Full.'' The former journalist's broad social satire tweaked
Atlanta's provincial nerves with its epic tale of a big-time real
estate developer on the ropes and sold Danielle Steel-like numbers.
Meanwhile, much-admired Atlanta playwright, essayist and novelist
Pearl Cleage joined the ranks of authors invited to Oprah Winfrey's
Book Club.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Wolfe could donate some of his profits to the Arts
Festival of Atlanta, which shut down after 44 years when it
couldn't rebound from massive debts incurred by the event's bold
relocation downtown in 1997. Accusatory fingers pointed in all
directions, but one of the disturbing upshots seems to be that
Atlanta isn't ready to get behind a world-class arts festival. We'd
really rather watch sports on big-screen TV. While second-guessers
said, ``I told you so,'' there were encouraging signs of life: New
art spaces began to pop up downtown, and two concert halls _ the
Rialto Center for the Performing Arts and the Tabernacle _ thrived.
Transitions continued elsewhere, as well, as the Atlanta Symphony
Orchestra searched for a new conductor, the High Museum of Art and
the Carlos Museum welcomed new curators, and the Nexus Contemporary
Art Center looked for a new director.
</P>
<P>
   The city's biggest pop event, a production of Disney's
``Elaborate Lives: The Legend of Aida,'' didn't have much to do
with the theater that happened to host it _ the Alliance. But it
didn't matter one way or another, in terms of the Alliance's
artistic stature, because Kenny Leon had already alloyed pop
culture glamour and home-grown excellence with his stunning
production of Phylicia Rashad's ``Medea.'' And if high culture
wasn't your cup of meat, by golly, there was the Dad's Garage
production of ``Cannibal! The Musical,'' an adaptation of a film by
``South Park'' creator Trey Parker.
</P>
<P>
   Bad taste? Pass the salt and pepper.

   CHATTANOOGA: Decorative Arts
</P>
<P>
   The Porteras have played a canny game of urban Monopoly in
developing the district, acquiring historic buildings as they came
on the market and rehabbing the structures. The first was the
Newell House, now home to the River Gallery, Chocolate Kitchen
(where sinfully rich hand-dipped candies are made and sold) and
Rembrant's Coffee House. Renaissance Commons, which serves as a
special events facility and management offices, opened in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, the Porteras have purchased three historic homes
scattered throughout the one-square-block district that are
collectively known as the Bluff View Inn. The C.G. Martin House, a
1927 Colonial-style home, is also the site of the Back Cafe Inn.
The 1908 Victorian-style T.C. Thompson house was the home of a
former Chattanooga mayor. Its carriage house is now Tony's Pasta
Shop &AMP; Trattoria. Lats year, the Maclellan House, which dates to
the late 1880s, became the third and largest bed-and-breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent visit, we stayed at the Maclellan House in a cozy
third-floor room, elegantly decorated in soothing tones of mauve
and green and furnished with a queen-size sleigh bed, an antique
secretary and sofa. Large windows provided a view of the river and
Veterans Bridge. The tub had water jets to revive tired legs after
a long day of sightseeing.
</P>
<P>
   During the holidays, a Christmas tree decorated with vintage
teddy bears and natural materials _ including raffia, topiary and
lichen ornaments, grapevines, dried pods, pepper berries, dried
pomegrates, twig bundles and pine cones _ stands in the grand
home's parlor.
</P>
<P>
   Guests of all three inns are invited to breakfast in the Audubon
Room at the Maclellan. After our omelettes and French toast, we
wandered through the many rooms of the River Gallery, a fine art
and craft gallery featuring its sixth annual Salon Show. The
invitational exhibit showcases the works of 12 gallery artists in a
variety of media and styles.
</P>
<P>
   In the serene Sculpture Garden on the riverbank, we absorbed the
beauty of both art and nature as golden leaves fell from ginkgo
trees.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 pieces are a part of the permanent collection and
another 20 are in the 1998-1999 exhibit ``Integration Art &AMP;
Nature.'' If you happen to fall in love with a piece from the
exhibition, you can take it home _ for a price. The works range
from $1,500 to $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   But sculpture is not confined to the garden. Exploring the
district, you'll see environmental works at every turn as well as
wonderful architectural details such as the stained glass panel at
Tony's and a solid copper-clad door from the Ohio Governor's
Mansion at Renaissance Commons.
</P>
<P>
   As evening fell, lights on the bridges began to twinkle. From
the overlook next to the bocce ball court at the Maclellan House,
we gazed across the river.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when many downtowns would be rolling up their
sidewalks, plenty of skaters and strollers were moving to and fro
across the bridge. In this city smitten with renewal, no one seemed
to be in a rush to get home.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &QR;  GETTING THERE
</P>
<P>
   From Atlanta,travel north on I-75 to I-24 west. From I-24, take

follow Fourth Street seven blocks to High Street and turn left. Go
two blocks and turn right. To reach Frazier Avenue, follow Fourth
to Market Street (at the third light) and proceed across the
bridge, turning right at the first light.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  STAYING OVER
</P>
<P>
   The Bluff View Inn offers accommodations in three homes in the
art district. Rates ($100-$250) include a three-course gourmet
breakfast in the Audubon Room or continental fare at Rembrandt's.
Each room is individually decorated with antiques and original art.
423-265-5033.
</P>

St. 423-265-5033, Ext. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Tony's: It's fun putting together your own pasta creation by

Spinach and cheese-filled spinach ravioli with gorgonzola cream
sauce was super-rich but tasty. Most dinner entrees less than $10.
412 Second St. 423-265-5033, Ext. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Back Inn Cafe: This Italian bistro goes decidedly upscale at

</P>
<P>
   Southside Grill: For a taste of what's cooking _ literally and
figuratively _ in Chattanooga's re-emerging Southside, don't miss
this new restaurant in an old warehouse. We can vouch for
pan-roasted chicken breast with grilled organic vegetables and
shoestring potatoes ($18.50) and grilled filet mignon with garlic
mashed potatoes and fried onion straws ($22). It's easy to see why
this is one of the city's hottest restaurants. 14th and Cowart

 &HT;    City's bridge to a fun future links inviting enclaves that add
artsy new life to downtown
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHATTANOOGA _ Like fences, bridges make good neighbors. That's
especially true of the Walnut Street Bridge over the Tennessee
River.
</P>
<P>
   The 3/4-mile pedestrian span between the Market Street and
Veterans bridges links the chic Bluff View Art District on the
south bank and still developing but definitely cool Frazier Avenue
on the North Shore.
</P>
<P>
   Bluff View boasts elegant inns, tony restaurants, an upscale
gallery and a riverside sculpture garden. Offbeat Frazier Avenue is
a mishmash of storefront shops, galleries and come-as-you-are
eateries, including a coffeehouse, a greasy spoon and a vegetarian
diner.
</P>
<P>
   Though quite different in character, these artsy enclaves are
two of the hippest neighborhoods in this vibrant metropolis that
has rejuvenated its once-derelict downtown and has more to offer
visitors with each year.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent sunny morning, the bridge was bustling with comings
and goings: Teens zipping along on in-line skates. Moms pushing
babies in strollers. Older couples out for a walk. Schoolchildren
on field trips playing leapfrog over stanchions designed to thwart
any notion of driving across the span.
</P>
<P>
   From the bridge, with its turquoise trusses and wood-planked
walkways, you can see the distinctive triangles that form the roof
line of the Tennessee Aquarium. Its prominence goes way beyond its
commanding place on the skyline. Since opening in 1992, it has
sparked not only downtown's redevelopment but the riverfront
renaissance as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly was the reason for a lot of the wind under our
wings,'' says Mary Portera. Along with her husband, physician
Charles Portera, she founded the Bluff View Art District and opened
the River Gallery four months after the aquarium opened less than a
half mile west.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on the bridge and looking north, you can witness yet
another sign of the city's rebirth: the construction of two
pavilions in Coolidge Park behind the rows of stores along Frazier
Avenue. By summer, they will house an old-fashioned carousel with
hand-carved horses and a food court.
</P>
<P>
   All this revitalization has created not only a tempting tourist
destination _ Atlantans looking for a quick holiday getaway can be
here in two hours _ but a more interesting place to live.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Charles McKinney and Ed Huckaby, whom we found making
themselves very at home in well-worn easy chairs in Mudpie, a folk
art-filled newstand/coffeehouse on Frazier Avenue. The two buds,
both 37, were smoking cigs, drinking cups of joe and basically
escaping their wives and kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``The atmosphere is great,'' McKinney says. ``We come here to
de-stress. They've really done a lot to bring this area back.''
Adds Huckaby: ``You can walk on the bridge at 11 o'clock at night
and feel safe. Kids from the college (University of
Tennessee-Chattanooga) come to the bridge to play guitar and sing.
It's a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Mudpie's lived-in look and hodgepodge of furniture suits Frazier
Avenue, which is well on its way from frumpy to funky.
</P>
<P>
   When Angela Usrey opened her eponymous gallery of American folk
art four years ago, she became one of the first to take a chance on
two rundown blocks of Frazier east of Market Street.
</P>
<P>
   Many businesses have followed, but, she says, ``I still consider
everybody over here a pioneer. . . . We're still a work in
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   As you amble down the sidewalks _ popping in and out of the
delightfully eclectic stores such as River City Apparel Outlet,
Barrett &AMP; Co. Booksellers, In-Town Gallery and Cook Works _ you'll
notice sets of brass footprints embedded in the pavement. Look
again, and you'll see they are dance patterns. Where else can you
learn the mambo and waltz, the tango and the twist while you shop?
</P>
<P>
   Frazier Avenue's more than 30 shops seem to offer a little bit
of everything: Medusa for ethnic art. Cigars &AMP; Gifts for smokes and
more. Elements for mod furnishings and home decor. The Big Much for
a fabulous assortment of toys. New Moon Gallery for New Age
accouterments. Choo Choo Tackle for outdoor and fishing gear. One
Earth for natural foods. Rosie Remembers for beautiful imported
Christmas ornaments. Chattanooga Hempery for hemp clothing and
jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   At Angela Usrey Gallery, you'll find a colorful collection of
outsider art by the likes of Jimmie Lee Sudduth, Howard Finster,
R.A. Miller, Homer Green, Purvis Young and Bessie Harvey.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Worm &AMP; Weasel Werks, a former gas station where
two sisters (whose childhood nicknames gave the shop its fanciful
name) sell natural-fiber clothing and vintage-look jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   On the shopping district's outskirts, near the foot of the
Walnut Street Bridge, is the Chattanooga Theatre Centre, which is
presenting ``Miracle on 34th Street'' through Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Look south across the river, and you'll see perched on the bluff
the city's fine Hunter Museum of American Art _ both the original
Hunter mansion and the modern addition. A bit farther along the
bluff is the three-story Tudor mansion that is one of the three
houses that make up the Bluff View Inn.
</P>
<P>
   From Frazier Avenue, it's a short stroll across the bridge and
up the Riverwalk, a pedestrian byway that hugs the riverbank, to
reach the Bluff View Art District.
</P>
<P>
   The gentrified arts area is tucked away on a cul de sac at the
intersection of East Second and High streets, adjacent to the
Hunter Museum and the Houston Museum of Decorative Arts.

 &HT;    Seasonal greenery mixes with small shrubs and houseplants to
make the indoors festive
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Too rushed to deck the halls? Too cramped to put up a
tree?
</P>
<P>
   Relax. You can still bring the holidays indoors with a seasonal
plant, such as a poinsettia, Christmas cactus or potted spruce. But
why not think outside the decorating box and combine those plants
with less traditional ones to create eye-catching displays?
Creamy-white poinsettias with deep red amaryllis and frilly
maidenhair fern. Bright red poinsettias with delicate white orchids
and trailing English ivy. Pastel-pink amaryllis with sweet-scented
paperwhite narcissus and pink-and-green variegated calathea.
</P>
<P>
   Or to keep things really simple, try a potted or burlapped
landscape plant _ a boxwood, cedar or cryptomeria, or a shrubby
herb such as rosemary or lavender _ clip it in a conical shape to
resemble a Christmas tree and tie a ribbon around it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's nice is that after the holidays most of these plants
can be put in the garden. So you end up with something for indoors
or out,'' said Dan Belman of Boxwoods Gardens and Gifts in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Think of these live arrangements, or ``compositions,'' as a pot
of soup. Each plant, like each ingredient, is fine by itself. But
when you combine them with others, the results can be delectable.
</P>
<P>
   The key, said Randy Korando, Boxwoods' co-owner, is to think
big. ``If you aren't doing a tree, do masses of plants with a lot
of the same color to create impact,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So how do you know which plants make good mates?
</P>
<P>
   Consider the plants' color, scale and texture. You already know
the Christmas colors. For scale, aim for a plant that will provide
height (orchids, amaryllis, paperwhites), something that will spill
over the container (ferns, ivy, creeping fig) and a medium-size
plant for filling in the center (poinsettia, kalanchoe, cyclamen).
Or, as best-selling gardening author Felder Rushing puts it,
``something roundy, something spiky and something frilly.''
</P>
<P>
   Think outside the clay pot as well. Look around the house before
rushing out to buy something new, Korando said. Consider Grandma's
silver epergne, the garden's rustic urn, the deck's concrete
trough.
</P>
<P>
   The cost for a composition, whether you create it yourself or
pay a florist, varies widely, depending on its size and the plant
selection. ``But for the cost of an arrangement of cut flowers that
will last only three days, you can have something that lasts for
three months,'' Belman said.
</P>
<P>
   And, in the case of potted landscape plants, even longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't do anything but buy a little boxwood and tie a
big red bow around it,'' said Judy Perry of Forrester's, an Atlanta
florist, ``the point is to bring something indoors for Christmas.''

 &HT;    Books offer ideas for handling hectic holidays
 &HT;    By Amanda Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ More evidence 13 is an unlucky number: Count the days
until Christmas. And you're already at wits' end.
</P>
<P>
   The holidays ratchet up everyday stresses and worries.
</P>
<P>
   A little concerned about the family budget? Well, you still have
to buy gifts for your sister's four kids. That's if you can find a
parking space at the store.
</P>
<P>
   How to cope? Books and books and more books have plenty of
advice on stress relief. At a Barnes &AMP; Noble store in Atlanta,
countless volumes offer hope for ``Instant Stress Relief'' or
``Mastery of Stress.''
</P>
<P>
   What stress books all stress are the three basics _ good diet,
regular exercise and restful sleep. But there's also some advice
you might not expect _ deep breathing, for instance, or saying
``no'' without guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Ten pieces of advice from dozens of people who know enough about
stress relief to write a book:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Thorsons Principles of Stress Management'' (Thorsons
publishers, $11):Pay attention to the warning signs of stress:
Increased smoking or drinking, overeating, eating very little,
neglecting appearance, shutting yourself off from others, driving
aggressively, starting lots of projects and never finishing them,
nervous activities such as nail biting or hair pulling.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Idiot's Guide to Managing Stress'' (Alpha Books, $16.95):
Check your stress level by mapping out your average work week, and
activities outside of work, particularly during the holidays. Start
with your start time _ whether it's heading to the office or
dropping the kids at school _ and note lunch and break times, and
get a daily total. Is it too much to handle comfortably? Ask for
help from co-workers or family; cut back on activities that aren't
essential.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Instant Stress Relief'' (Ballantine Books, $5.99):Eat
well-balanced meals, including breakfast, and drink plenty of
water. Take a vitamin-mineral supplement, eat more fiber and limit
saturated fats. Monitor caffeine consumption, and if you drink, do
so in moderation. Learn which foods relax you. If it's a cup of
herbal tea, drink it.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Working Woman's Guide to Managing Stress'' (Prentice
Hall, $14.95):Without exercise you become more fatigued and tense,
not less. If you can't take an exercise class or schedule time for
some other organized activity, put on some music and dance around
the house for 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Life Puzzle, Putting the Pieces Together'' (Good for You
publishing, $24.95), ``Thorsons Principles of Stress Management,''
``Idiot's Guide to Managing Stress'' and many other books:Breathe.
Deep breathing as a relaxation technique can be done anytime,
anywhere. It slows down a racing heart and mind, gives you time to
reflect.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Guide to Stress Reduction'' (Celestial Arts, $12.95) and
many other books:Meditate. That doesn't necessarily mean a mantra
and lotus position. It could just mean sitting quietly for five
minutes in a comfortable chair, closing your eyes and letting your
mind drift. If you fall asleep, back to the basics _ maybe you're
not getting that good night's rest.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Working Woman's Guide to Managing Stress,'' ``Beat
Stress With Strength, A Survival Guide to for Work and Life'' (Park
Avenue Productions, $12.95), and others:Just say ``no,'' say it
without guilt, say it politely and mean it. Taking on too much
because others ``need'' you is a quick route to burnout.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``When 9 to 5 Isn't Enough'' (Hay House Inc., $12):Take breaks
during the work day. Even five minutes outside the office can do
wonders for concentration and recharging, and fresh air is
refreshing.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Working Woman's Guide to Managing Stress,'' ``Idiot's
Guide to Managing Stress'' and others:Practice visualization
techniques, visualize the future. People who use visualization as a
stress-reducer think about pastoral scenes; clear, cool streams;
places they visited once and loved. Those who visualize the future
begin to plan ways to make it happen.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Idiot's Guide to Managing Stress'' and others:Use
aromatherapy. Remember the welcoming smell of mom's fresh-baked
bread? Pleasing scents have the ability to soothe the most troubled
mind. All the better if it's scented bath oil and the end of the
day.
</P>
<P>
   If all else fails, try counting backward from 13, one day at a
time.
</P>

 &HT;    For many American Jews with small children, focusing on their
own religious beliefs this time of year becomes the challenge of
Hanukkah
 &HT;    By Ron Feinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ While the religious holidays of Christmas and Hanukkah
fall at about the same time each year, they share little in common.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the beauty of Christmas _ twinkling lights, festive
music, decorated wreaths and trees _ is a distraction and constant
challenge for Jewish educators and parents wanting to teach their
kids about the Jewish holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Hanukkah, the Festival of Lights, begins at sundown Sunday and
continues for eight days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's difficult to keep our focus on our holiday,''
says Raye Lynn Banks, director of the Sunshine School, a Jewish
preschool in east Cobb County(GA.) operated by the Atlanta Jewish
Community Center. ``Kids see all the lights and can't help but
think about all the gifts'' their Christian friends are getting for
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Hanukkah, which means dedication in Hebrew, recalls the
rededication of the Second Temple in Jerusalem after the military
victory of the Maccabees over the Seleucid Greeks in 165 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   The holiday is celebrated by lighting one candle the first night
of the festival, two on the second, and so on, until eight candles
are burning in a special candleholder, a menorah, on the eighth and
final night.
</P>
<P>
   The story includes a spiritual twist, based on a Talmudic
legend, that details a miracle. When the Maccabees rededicated the
Temple, they found only one small jar of sacred oil to be used to
rekindle the holy menorah. The jar contained oil for only one
night, but miraculously burned for eight, until fresh oil could be
produced.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the messages of Hanukkah is that those who are devoted
and committed can overcome great odds,'' says Rabbi Shalom Lewis of
Congregation Etz Chaim in east Cobb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our challenge,'' says Lewis, 49, ``is never to be intimidated
by overwhelming odds.''
</P>
<P>
   But practicing Judaism and observing Hanukkah in America,
particularly in the Bible Belt of the South, can be intimidating.
</P>
<P>
   A sense of purpose and sense of humor can help.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my daughter Jill was small we were at the mall and she
saw Santa,'' Lewis says. ``She wanted to sit on Santa's lap, like
all the other kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I told her the line was way too long and perhaps we could
just walk by him and wave. She was OK with that. She waved and
Santa waved back. It worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so easily handled, however, is the issue of gifts.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, Hanukkah was a minor holiday on the Jewish
calendar, a time to recall the might of the Maccabees and the
miracle of the oil.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 1920s in America, some Jewish parents started doing
for their children what their Christian neighbors already were
doing each Christmas. That link _ the giving of gifts _ continues
to this day.
</P>
<P>
   But at the Sunshine School and other preschools and synagogues,
efforts are made each year to focus on the religious significance
of the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to let the kids know all about the holiday,'' said
Ellen Michelson, assistant director of the Sunshine School.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids know about the gifts; but we try to teach them why we
celebrate the holiday, about the customs and history,'' Michelson
added. ``The kids are very receptive.''
</P>
<P>
   On this day at the Sunshine School, the ``Superstars'' (a
classroom of 18 4-year-olds) are making dreidels, a top with Hebrew
letters on its four sides that is used in a holiday game.
</P>
<P>
   Their little fingers juggle the plum-sized pieces of wood as
they attempt to paste the multicolored Hebrew letters onto the
smooth sides.
</P>
<P>
   Class discussion, led by Linda Geiger, a nine-year teacher at
the school, focuses on the Maccabees and doing the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can all be Maccabees,'' Geiger tells her students.
</P>
<P>
   And many agree, offering suggestions on what they can do right
in their lives, like listening to their parents, talking nice and
not making fun of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting along'' is good and right, says Geiger, 59.
</P>
<P>
   And that's a thought Lewis thinks many of us need to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very first message of Hanukkah is religious freedom,''
Lewis says. ``There are elements in our society today that think
their religious system is the answer for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the case,'' he says. ``Such thinking is spiritual
tyranny and has no place in God's world.''
</P>
<P>
   But the other side of the puzzle, he says, is believing in
nothing, forgetting the transcendent messages of both holidays,
trying to somehow ``squash the two beliefs'' into one.
</P>
<P>
   Banks remembers facing the issue squarely, telling her own
children years ago why Santa never made it to their house each
holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hanukkah,'' she remembers saying, ``isn't a Jewish
Christmas.''

Journal-Constitution.

 &HT;    Here are some ideas to reduce stress of December days
 &HT;    By Eric Sundquist
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Adopting a simple lifestyle can be a complicated undertaking. At
least it would be if you tried to read all the books on the
subject, or thoroughly downsize by selling your sport-utility
vehicle and five-bedroom house.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not necessary to get a degree in simplicity to take
advantage of some of its ideas, and the holidays offer many
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just taking one step _ maybe having a potluck instead of a
formal Christmas dinner _ will go a long way toward minimizing the
stress people feel at the holidays,'' says Elaine St. James, author
of ``Simplify Your Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   A starting point for simplifying the holidays: ``Sit down and
take some time and think. What do we like? And what causes the
stress? For some it might be the shopping, or it might be Christmas
cards,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some ideas to consider, from St. James and others.
Before you call us Scrooge, remember that the Cratchit family had a
truly merry Christmas without ever visiting a mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about bah, humbug,'' says St. James. ``It's about
making choices. We can't do it all.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ignore the how-to holiday articles that fill many magazines
all autumn. Martha Stewart has some great ideas, but she also has a
large staff and electronic airbrushing programs to make them look
truly picture-perfect. In the real world, a simple holiday dinner _
even pizza _ might be more pleasant for the family than one that
requires hours of preparation and cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't confuse organizing with simplifying. Being organized
might actually complicate things. Shopping and decorating early may
just spread stress through more of the year.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Consider the environment. Eco-sound practices often have a
side benefit of saving money. Wrapping presents and mailing
Christmas cards, for example, are costly to the wallet and the
Earth's resources. Another Earth-friendly idea: Instead of killing
a tree to have in the house for a few weeks, decorate one in the
yard with popcorn or birdseed, and watch the birds flock to feed.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Cut back on gift giving and receiving. Have everyone in your
extended family draw one name; each person can give and get one
thoughtful gift instead of 20 landfill-bound electric tie racks or
Chia Pets. Cut back at home, too. The kids might just get the
message that the holidays aren't only about getting presents. Take
the idea one step further and give the gift of your family's time
in a homeless shelter or other charity.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Above all, do what's meaningful, not what you think is
expected. The holidays can become a keeping-up-with-the-Joneses
treadmill. Getting off means you might not win the subdivision
award for best holiday decor. But the simple creche or menorah you
put up in place of a Las Vegas-like light show might be the only
symbol you really need to tap into the seasonal spirit. ``When I
started to simplify, some people said `What?' '' says St. James, a
former real estate businesswoman. ``But I said I'm not interested
in impressing people who want to live like that.''

 &HT;    Georgians help to restore Jesus' hometown
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Four Georgians are helping to restore and re-create
the hometown of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Carter and his wife, Rosalynn; former Atlanta
Mayor Andrew Young; and Linda C. Fuller, president of Habitat for
Humanity International, are all key players in the Miracle of
Nazareth International Foundation Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation recently began work restoring first-century
terrace walls and clearing brush on a Nazareth hillside
archaeologists say once may have been cultivated by Jesus and his
family.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers hope to have a significant part of the work complete
in time for the influx of millions of pilgrims to Israel in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   This will be no Six Flags Over the Holy Land, Fuller promised.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to develop a theme park,'' she said. ``It
will be more on the idea of historic Williamsburg. Much research
has to go into it to make it as authentic as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   People will be dressed in period costume doing work that may
have been done in Jesus' time, she said. There also will be a
museum where visitors can learn the New Testament version of Jesus'
life, death and resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   On her first visit to Israel, Fuller said, she was disappointed
so many sites believed to have been significant in Jesus' time are
now covered by churches and shrines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to get a sense of the way it would have
been when Jesus was there,'' she said. ``Our purpose is to
re-create a setting that would have been very similar to the way it
would have been.''
</P>
<P>
   About 400 volunteers from the Nazareth area joined the mayor of
Nazareth and project organizers in late November to clear brush
from the land and rebuild terrace walls. The work is supervised by
conservationists.
</P>
<P>
   Workers hope to reclaim archaeological finds, such as a wine
press, watchtowers and farmland terraces that date to early Roman
and Hellenistic periods, and to reconstruct houses and other
buildings to resemble as nearly as possible those of the first
century.
</P>
<P>
   When work is complete, visitors should get a better
understanding of Jesus' life and of some of the parables and
lessons of his ministry, said Dr. Nakhle Bishara, an Arab Christian
physician in Nazareth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where people once saw dusty stones and open meadows, we hope
they'll now see the mustard plants, vineyards and olive trees of
Jesus' childhood that he used to illustrate spiritual truth.''

 &HT;    Texans react to tobacco settlement lawsuit
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texans for Reasonable Legal Fees blasted it as
an unreasonable legal fee.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Metroplex Citizens Against Lawsuit Abuse said
it's the reason they are against lawsuit abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush called it ``exorbitant,'' and the chairman
of the House Appropriations Committee blasted it as ``excessive.''
</P>
<P>
   While there is some debate about exactly how much money five
Texas law firms will share for representing the state in the
tobacco lawsuit, there is no doubt that the answer will include a
word _ ``billion'' _ that produces unfiltered disgust among some.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Friday he just doesn't get it and doesn't think he
ever will. The fees, valued at $3.3 billion by the lawyers who will
get them over several years, are ``exorbitant,'' said the governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never understand and never agree that five private law
firms should collect more than $3.3 billion for working less than
two years on a case that was settled before it went to trial,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fee seems totally out of proportion for the work
performed,'' said Bush, former managing general partner of a
baseball team that paid players millions of dollars to use a wooden
club-like device to attempt to strike a horsehide-covered sphere.
</P>
<P>
   The suddenly-even-richer lawyers were cool under pressure Friday
as the criticism piled up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a true honor to represent the state of Texas in its
historic lawsuit against the tobacco industry,'' they said Friday
in a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
   The fee was set by an arbitration panel including members
appointed by the attorneys and the tobacco industry. In their
Friday statement, the lawyers said the panel came up with a base
fee of 10 percent of the $17.3-billion settlement, but didn't stop
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recognizing the staggering risks in taking up the tobacco
fight, Texas' contributions as pioneers in tobacco litigation and
the tremendous results we obtained, the panel determined to apply a
`difficulty' factor of 1.9 percent,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he was pleased that his intervention in the court
battle helped make sure the lawyers' fees will come from the
tobacco companies, not taxpayers' pockets.
</P>
<P>
   House Appropriations Chairman Rob Junell, D-San Angelo, blasted
the fees, but said he could do little more than gripe from the
sidelines as long as the money does not come from state coffers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the amount of money is excessive,'' said Junell, an
attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Ratliff, executive director of the Metroplex Citizens
Against Lawsuit Abuse, called the arbitrators' award ``the epitome
of legal fee abuse.''

 &HT;    Offenders break out of youth lockup
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Five of 11 teen-age offenders who cut their way
to freedom through a fence at a Bryan prison for juveniles were
recaptured Friday as a statewide manhunt continued for the others,
including one who called his mother and promised to be home for
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   The youths, ages 14 to 17, were being held at the Hamilton State
School on charges ranging from burglary to arson to robbery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never had this many kids escape before from any of our
facilities,'' said Judy Briscoe, a spokeswoman for the Texas Youth
Commission, which operates the 520-bed Hamilton lockup. ``We feel
it was a planned escape.''
</P>
<P>
   Superintendent Dale Price said the escapees apparently used a
key to unlock a fire-escape door, then cut a hole in a 12-foot-high
security fence with wire-cutters. An investigation was under way to
determine how the delinquents got access to both items.
</P>
<P>
   Recaptured without incident about 3 p.m. Friday were Michael
Barker, 16, of Athens; Mark Gamez, 17, of Arlington; Kenneth
McLarty, 16, of Stephenville; Steve Lair, 14, of Glen Rose; and
Billy Sanford, 14, of Port Arthur. Police said they were found
hiding inside an abandoned trailer about two miles south of the
center.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Barker and Gamez were serving time at Hamilton
on drug charges, McLarty was in for indecency with a child, and
Lair and Sanford were in for burglary.
</P>
<P>
   Still at large were James Remmer, 17, of Dallas, held for
assault with a weapon; Joseph Trahan, 15, of Hardin County, held
for escape; Tim Bain, 16, of San Antonio, for theft; Donald Flint,
17, of Houston, for armed robbery; Chris Victorino, 16, of San
Antonio, for arson; and Brian Frazer, 16, of Abilene, for burglary.
</P>
<P>
   Flint was being sought in Houston, where he reportedly paid his
grandmother a brief visit and phoned his mother to announce he
would be home for Christmas, Briscoe said. Another escapee was
spotted in San Antonio, and others were believed headed for the
Dallas area. Police searches were under way in those cities late
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the escape occurred about 7:30 p.m. Thursday,
as a steady rain and fog blanketed the area.
</P>
<P>
   A security panel signaled that a locked fire escape in one of
the center's dorms had been opened. Guards who checked it spotted a
third of the dorm's residents squeezing through a hole in a
perimeter fence about 15 yards away.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the fence was clipped open at a point where the
chain-link panels are attached to a metal pole. Once through the
fence, the escapees split up as they sprinted across an open field
toward Bryan's business district. ``Five ran one direction; three
went another; three went off in another,'' Briscoe said.
</P>
<P>
   By the time police and sheriff's deputies could cordon off the
area, some escapees had stolen a car from an employee's parking lot
and others had fled on foot. The car was recovered near the Texas
A&AMP;M University campus in College Station, several miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think they probably stole another car there, but we have no
reports yet of one being missing,'' Briscoe said. Bloodhound teams
from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice were brought in late
Thursday to assist the more than 100 law enforcement officers who
searched throughout the night in the immediate area. But their
efforts were hampered by the bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the escape the youths were wearing assorted
orange jumpsuits and khaki and blue pants with T-shirts _ ``their
normal apparel,'' Briscoe said.
</P>
<P>
   Youth commission officials immediately ordered a full
investigation of the escape, including a review of security
procedures at the year-old lockup, which in recent months has been
plagued by behavioral problems among offenders. Officials said it
was the first escape at Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   Briscoe said no key had been re- ported missing by staff
members, and investigators were attempting to determine how the
youths got a key to unlock the fire door.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Texas' adult prisons, the youth commission's lockups have
only a single perimeter fence. Guards at the youth lockups are not
armed as they are in prisons, although doors are kept locked and
offenders' whereabouts are closely monitored and controlled.
</P>
<P>
   While youth commission officials would not say Friday whether
any of the escapees had been involved in the earlier problems,
Briscoe said several of them were within a month of being released.
In the past, Briscoe said, escapes from youth commission lockups
have involved only up to four offenders at a time.

 &HT;    Lawyers win fees in Texas tobaaco settlement
 &HT;    WITH REACT-COX
 &HT;    By Osler McCarthy
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Five Texas lawyers hired to sue U.S. cigarette
makers have won legal fees that could amount to almost $3.3 billion
over 25 years, a divided three-person team of arbitrators has
decided.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas lawyers said Friday that the tobacco industry _ and
not the state _ is obligated to pay the entire amount, but one of
the arbitrators said the attorneys will likely see no more than $1
billion. A a second arbitrator called the fees excessive.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush and others called the fees excessive for a
case that never went to court. The tobacco industry settled with
Texas for $17.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the arbitrators affects only what lawyers from
Texas, Florida and Mississippi will receive. Two of the same
arbitrators must also determine next year what lawyers from other
states will be paid as part of a $206 billion national agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the national agreement, the industry is only
obligated to pay $500 million a year in legal fees. All attorneys
from all states must draw from that pot of cash.
</P>
<P>
   The arbitrators also decided that a sixth attorney, Marc Murr of
Houston, should be paid $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Murr surprised and angered many attorneys when he laid claim to
part of the legal fees despite criticism that he did little
apparent work in the tobacco case.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement with Murr and his claims to the fees drew sharp
protest from Arthur Golden, one of the attorneys representing the
tobacco industry and may result in investigations by lawmakers and
Attorney General-elect John Cornyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Murr clearly is not entitled, as he claims, to one-sixth
of the aggregate attorneys' fee that the panel determines is
reasonable for this litigation,'' Golden wrote in a letter to the
arbitrators obtained by the Austin American-Statesman. ``All
reasonably probative evidence makes clear that any contributions by
Murr was at most paltry _ both relatively and in absolute terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Murr's attorney, Roy Minton of Austin, said Golden's objections
were refuted at the arbitration hearing last weekend in New York.
``It was clear that he did not have knowledge of anything,'' Minton
said.
</P>
<P>
   The arbitrators' award to the Texas plaintiffs' lawyers _
calculated at 19 percent of what Texas recovered from the tobacco
companies _ surpasses the federal court order setting their fees at
15 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement the Texas lawyers issued Friday, they recalled
their contributions in winning the $17 billion state settlement,
but it did not mention whether they would seek money from the
state's recovery _ which they are entitled to do under the terms of
the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   They noted that lawyers for 46 other states that settled with
tobacco companies last month would share in the $500 million-a-year
legal fees in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until all of these 46 states' fees are determined, it is
impossible to know how much in fees the Texas attorneys will
actually receive or what it is worth in today's dollars,'' the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who sued to protest the legal fees awarded by the judge in
January because he believed the state was obligated to pay them,
called the arbitrators' award exorbitant. ``The fee seems totally
out of proportion for the work performed,'' Bush said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Tort-reform groups also complained.
</P>
<P>
   Even the arbitration panel was split over the size of the legal
fees.
</P>
<P>
   One of the members, former federal judge Charles Renfrew, of San
Francisco, said the huge fees only help to undermine the the legal
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The work of counsel in each of the states has truly been
remarkable and brought about unparalleled recoveries,'' he wrote in
a dissenting opinion. ``They should be fairly and fully
compensated. However, we need to be mindful that these excessive
fees will undermine public confidence in this arbitration, in our
profession and in our civil justice system.''
</P>
<P>
   Another member of the arbitration panel, Texas Tech Law School
Dean Frank Newton, said the $3.3 billion calculation for the Texas
legal fees was misleading.
</P>
<P>
   Even if no other lawyers for other states shared in the legal
fees, Newton said, a Yale professor's financial analysis showed the
tobacco industry would never pay more than $7 billion when the $500
million-a-year payment was reduced to what it would be worth today
in a lump sum.
</P>
<P>
   At best, the private lawyers would get only $1.1 billion if they
cashed in the tobacco companies' obligation the way mortgage
lenders resell home loans reduced to present values.
</P>
<P>
   The Murr award by the so-called national arbitration panel, in
stark contrast to what a state panel said his work deserved,
represented a broader consideration by the national panel, Newton
said. Murr's own panel considered only his contract and support by
Morales and Murr, the attorney general's friend and onetime
fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Murr's attorney, Minton, said he did not know whether Murr would
seek a court order based on his special panel's finding that he
deserved 1.5 percent of the state's $17 billion recovery, or more
than $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   Morales supported Murr's claim before the national arbitrators
last Saturday. He has said Murr was invaluable in helping him with
strategy _ including the decision to sue the tobacco companies for
racketeering _ and assisted in choosing the state's tobacco team.
</P>
<P>
   But Murr's contract was dated in October 1996, months after
Morales hired the trial lawyers and after the state filed its
lawsuit with the racketeering claim in it.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys involved in various stages of the Texas tobacco
litigation said they never dealt with him. And two legislators who
negotiated an agreement for county hospitals to share in the
tobacco recovery _ an issue that stalled completion of the
settlement last summer _ said Murr tried to attend a final
negotiating session but they threw him out of the room at a
Texarkana courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never heard of the guy, much less saw him,'' said state Sen.
Bill Ratliff, who with state Rep. Rob Junell helped seal the deal
with hospital districts and counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Junell said to him, 'Who are you?' Then he kicked him out,''
Ratliff said.
</P>
<P>
   Ratliff said he and Junell had discussed a legislative
investigation of Murr's contract and claims when news broke this
week about his arbitration award.
</P>
<P>
   With his letter to the national arbitrators, Golden attached an
affidavit by another tobacco attorney, Stephen Patton of Chicago,
to support his claim that ``Mr. Murr's connection to the State's
case has been at best limited and indirect; at worst, it is a
post-hoc fabrication to exploit these proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   Morales and his spokesman, Ron Dusek, could not be reached for
comment late Friday.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a passionate debate that was by turns solemn
with history, fiercely partisan and at times sorrowful, the House
Judiciary Committee voted along party lines Friday to impeach
President Clinton and remove him from office for perjury and
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   About 4:20 P.M., the Republican-controlled committee, voting 21
to 16, late Friday afternoon charged Clinton in one article of
impeachment with providing ``perjurious, false and misleading
testimony'' last Aug. 17 before a grand jury investigating the
Monica Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, one Republican _ Rep. Lindsey O. Graham of
South Carolina _ broke with his party as the committee voted 20 to
17 to approve a second article of impeachment on perjury, this time
for Clinton's deposition in the Paula Corbin Jones sexual
harassment case. Graham had long said he would not support
impeachment for a lie in a civil case.
</P>
<P>
   And then at 9:15 P.M., the committee again voted 21 to 16, this
time to approve the third article, which accuses the president of
obstruction of justice. The article accuses Mr. Clinton of trying
to influence witnesses in the Lewinsky matter, including his
personal secretary and the White House intern. The committee
adjourned for the evening, planning to resume debate on the fourth
article of impeachment, on abuse of power, on Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   So what began with a civil sex harassment suit by an obscure
Arkansas civil servant and was transformed into a criminal
investigation of sex and mendacity by the president, left Clinton
Friday as the third president to confront impeachment, with a House
vote scheduled for next week.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Johnson was spared removal from office by one vote in the
Senate after the House impeached him in 1868. Richard Nixon
resigned in disgrace in the Watergate scandal 24 years ago after
the Judiciary Committee approved three articles against him, but
before the House voted.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, the chairman, brought the
Judiciary Committee's ten-week inquiry towards a close, insisting
on the gravity of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the president performs the public act of asking God to
witness his promise to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, that is not trivial,'' the Illinois Republican said.
``Whether it's a civil suit or before the grand jury the
significance of the oath cannot or must not be cheapened if our
proud boast that we are a government of laws and not of men is to
mean anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself commented for the first time since the committee
began televised proceedings. Just minutes before the committee was
to take its first vote, the president walked into the Rose Garden
and spoke once again of his remorse for his affair with Ms.
Lewinsky. For the first time he publicly said he would accept a
rebuke or censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mere words cannot fully express the profound remorse I feel
for what our country is going through and for what members of both
parties in Congress are now forced to deal with,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These past months have been a torturous process of coming to
terms with what I did,'' he said. ``I understand that
accountability demands consequences and I'm prepared to accept
them. Painful though the condemnation of the Congress would be, it
would pale in comparison to the consequences of the pain I have
caused my family. There is no greater agony.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton stopped well short of the admission that some
undecided Republicans were looking for that he had in fact lied
under oath.
</P>
<P>
   At the Judiciary Committee, most members left the debate to
watch the president on television. Then, minutes later, in the same
cavernous hearing room where Nixon's fate was weighed 24 years ago,
they voted to approve the first article of impeachment and moved on
to the second.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is to vote by Saturday on articles of impeachment
accusing the president of obstruction of justice and abuse of
power.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats argued that Clinton had deceived the nation, but
said he did not deserve removal from office for lies about an
extra-marital affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wake up America'' implored Rep. Robert Wexler of Florida,
calling for the nation, which polls show overwhelmingly opposes
impeachment, to make its feelings known. ``They are about to
impeach our president. They are about to reverse two national
elections. They are about to discard your votes.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The president's chances of avoiding trial in the Senate _ where
his opponents are exceedingly unlikely to get the 67 votes needed
for conviction _ rest with a few dozen Republican moderates. The
vote in the House, which is to return on Thursday, is considered
too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   Because the stakes are so high, both parties in the House were
prepared to take extraordinary steps to bring back members,
including carrying one California congressman recuperating from
surgery to Washington on an air ambulance if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that Clinton is not making headway, six previously
undeclared Republicans _ Jack Metcalf of Washington, Saxby Chamblis
of Georgia, Lincoln Diaz-Balart of Florida, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of
Florida, Bob Franks of New Jersey and Rodney Frelinghuysen of New
Jersey _ came out in favor of impeachment or said they were leaning
that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was needed from the president today was an admission, not
contrition,'' Franks said after Clinton's statement.
</P>
<P>
   And a moderate Republican who has said he opposes impeachment,
Rep. Amo Houghton of New York, became the target of a conservative
Republican who said he would run against Houghton in 2000. Jim
Pierce said Houghton had ``betrayed'' conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend has not been in the direction of those who want to
avoid impeachment,'' said Rep. Charles E. Schumer, New York's new
senator-elect. ``Over the weekend Americans are going to realize
this is for real.''
</P>
<P>
   There was also a signal from the Senate Friday that it was
suddenly taking seriously the possibility that it could become the
jury in a trial of the president. The press secretaries of Trent
Lott, the majority leader from Mississippi, and Tom Daschle, the
minority leader from South Dakota, did something they rarely do _
put out a joint statement. All it said was that the two men would
make no comment until after the House acted.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost a year ago that the independent counsel, Kenneth
Starr, began investigating the president's relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky and whether he was trying to persuade her to commit
perjury in the Paula Jones case. The investigation plunged the
White House into a yearlong crisis that Clinton compounded when he
emphatically told the nation that he had not had sex ``with that
woman,'' Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months later Starr reported to Congress that he had
``substantial and credible evidence'' that Clinton had committed 11
possibly impeachable offenses in his effort to cover-up the affair.
</P>
<P>
   At the time Hyde said ``we all agree any impeachment cannot
succeed unless it is done in a bipartisan way.'' But on Friday he
defended his inquiry.

STADIUM SITE CAN BE CLEANED UP, REGIONAL EPA CHIEF SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY AND GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Mass. _ Federal officials who once warned that the
site of the proposed new stadium for the New England Patriots
reeked of contamination, declared Friday the area could be cleaned
and made a model of environmental efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The statement was a dramatic turnabout from weeks ago when
environmental concerns at the site along the Connecticut River
threatened to undo the state's controversial plan to move the
football team to a $350 million publicly-financed stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But after touring the site Friday, John DeVillars, regional head
of the Environmental Protection Agency, enthusiastically embraced
the stadium proposal, saying the contamination cleanup would be
less costly than originally thought and that the stadium would be a
showcase for new environmentally sound construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a great opportunity here to bring in environmental
design principles _ through building materials and water
conservation,'' said DeVillars, who was joined on his tour by U.S.
Senator Joseph Lieberman, Hartford Mayor Michael Peters and project
visionary Richard Fiondella, chairman of Phoenix Home Life Mutual
Insurance Co. ``If we work together we can make this a model for
environmental design and efficiency. That's one of the things we
very much want to work on with project developer,'' DeVillars said.
</P>
<P>
   The US Department of Housing and Urban Development has already
committed $9 million _ a $2 million grant and a $7 million loan for
cleaning up the extensive contamination that could run seven-feet
deep, according to the EPA.
</P>
<P>
   A coal gasification plant that operated on the site from the
late 1800s until 1951 left behind coal, tar, and other hazardous
wastes such as benzine, cyanides, and heavy metals, officials have
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although DeVillars said the 2001 target date for opening the
stadium is ``aggressive,'' he said it was not impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary estimates for the cleanup have ranged between $80
million and $100 million. A full study on the environmental
problems at the site could begin within the next two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the contamination is significant, it is by no means
unresolvable and we're fully committed to working with the
developers to remediate the site expeditiously,'' DeVillars said.
</P>
<P>
   As he was touring the site Friday, Patriots owner Robert Kraft
and his son Jonathan met with Governor John Rowland's chief stadium
negotiators for most of the day, hammering out the details of a
development agreement before next Tuesday's scheduled vote by the
Connecticut General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland, who was in New London christening the USS Connecticut,
canceled plans to attend a reception at Foxwoods Resort &AMP; Casino
for the submarine launch and drove back to the Capitol to meet with
the Krafts around 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   While it has been widely speculated that the discussions would
mostly center on Rowland's desire to rewrite a controversial luxury
seat guarantee that could cost the state $175 million, officials
said more mundane aspects of the complex agreement took up most of
the negotiations. The first item on the agenda, according to people
close the negotiations, concerned guarantees that roads, ramps and
parking lots could be built in such a way to allow cars to be out
of stadium traffic in less than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   However, Patriots business manager Andy Wasynczuk, who was also
in the meetings Friday night, said lawmakers' desire to reduce the
state's risk on luxury seat guarantees would be discussed at some
point. Those guarantees would require the state to pay the team a
subsidy if it is unable to sell all of the expensive club seats and
luxury boxes. Skeptical legislators, of which there are a few, have
criticized those guarantees as a needless giveaway and have
threatened to vote against the proposal unless they are whittled
down.
</P>
<P>
   While the Krafts reportedly want to keep the guarantees intact,
there appeared to be some ``wiggle room,'' on the provisions,
sources said Friday. And officials said they weren't a major factor
in Friday's talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really been a lot about the development agreement, which
is going to be a highly technical and detailed document,''
Wasynczuk said. ``It's gotten to the point where communication
pretty much needs to be continuous til Tuesday. So whether it's by
meeting or phone communication or what have you, we'll be working

   Meanwhile, Rowland's budget director, Marc Ryan, released yet
another financial analysis of the project that contends the state
will reap between $20 million and $650 million over the 30-year
leasae period, depending on stadium attendance, the health of the

 WASHINGTON: his inquiry.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I don't want this to be an endless process,'' he said. ``I
think it's in the interest of the country to finish it and we have
tried to do our level best. And I have tried to grant every request
the Democrats have made. Maybe I haven't succeeded, but I have
certainly tried.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham, as he called for impeachment, praised a few of the
committee's Democrats. He said he admired Schumer greatly. He spoke
kindly of Rep. Thomas M. Barrett, a Wisconsin Democrat. ``He has
tried to say to this committee, `Let's bring the country
together,''' Graham said. ``What a noble cause. Don't worry, Mr.
Barrett, if we don't come together. This country is strong. We
shall survive.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the long day went on the partisanship became ever more
pronounced. Democrats fought to the end against every charge
against Clinton and they plunged the committee Republicans into
some noticeable confusion when they demanded to know precisely
which of the president's statements were perjurious.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said that in a presentation Thursday, David P. Schippers,
the Republicans' investigative counsel had ``set out in detail''
the lies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you should be able to tell me what they are,'' shot back
Rep. Jerrold Nadler, a New York Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde had to summon Schippers and his other chief aide, Thomas E.
Mooney to his side. It was finally Rep. James Sensenbrenner, who
began giving the answers, plowing grimly through the sexual details
needed to make the perjury charges.
</P>
<P>
   He cited Clinton's grand jury testimony that he did not think
his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky fit the definition of sexual
relations used by Ms. Jones' lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   He mentioned Clinton's denial when he was asked whether ``oral
sex performed on you was within the definition as you understood
it.'' He noted that Clinton conceded that ``kissing or touching of
the breast or genitalia of another person'' would be covered by the
definition of sex in the Jones case, and yet Clinton had still
denied lying when he said he had not had sexual relations with Ms.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The testimony is false and misleading,'' Sensenbrenner said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat, charged that the
Republicans were guilty of ``deliberate vagueness and obfuscation''
because they were prepared to impeach Clinton over definitions of
sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't tell us what he touched, therefore it was perjury,''
Frank said, mocking the Republicans case.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling the Watergate scandal of 24 years ago, Republicans
countered that the articles of impeachment against Nixon had also
lacked a detailed bill of particulars. And Rep. Charles Canady, a
Florida Republican, noted that it was the Republican defenders of
Nixon who had made the same demand for specifics.
</P>
<P>
   Sensenbrenner said the Democrats were really engaged in a
``clever ruse'' designed to limit the evidence that the Senate
could consider in any trial.
</P>
<P>
   But at other moments the debate reached a higher tone conscious
of history, as lawmakers quoted the nation's founders, and John
Kennedy and recalled wrenching chapters in the nation's history,
from civil war to assassinations.

   The Russian tax police said they seized cash and valuables from

LEGACY OF THE '90S BOOM: MORE JOBS FOR BLACK MEN  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 13) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By SYLVIA NASAR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One heartening byproduct of the current economic boom is that
more young black men are working or going to school. In the last
few years, unemployment rates have dropped sharply, the share of
16- to 24-year-olds at work has rebounded, and school enrollment
has spurted.
</P>
<P>
   Almost any gains on this front are worth celebrating. The
collapse of work among young black men in the 1960s and 1970s
counts as the biggest economic and social disaster of the
post-World War II era.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the bad old '40s and '50s, young black men were as
likely to work as young white men were. By the 1970s, the pay gap
between young black and young white workers had all but
disappeared. But in the decades that followed, steady, legitimate
work simply disappeared from the lives of half of the country's
young black men.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly eight years of growth, the tightest labor market in
decades is having a noticeable effect on their participation in the
work force and on employers' willingness to hire them. (The
employment figures do not reflect the growth in the percentage of
young black men who are in jail or prison, so it is unclear whether
things have improved quite as much as the jobs data show.)
</P>
<P>
   The question now is whether the recent improvement has a chance
of sticking through the next recession. Labor markets were tight in
the late 80s, and more young black men found work then, too _ only
to see their gains disappear in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   There are some reasons for cautious optimism. For starters, the
rewards of working have been growing lately. Since 1996, pay for
the bottom 20 percent of the work force _ the young, inexperienced
and unskilled, who tend to work in stores and restaurants _ are
seeing wage gains of 3.6 percent a year after inflation, thanks
both to increases in the minimum wage and to employers'
difficulties in filling vacancies.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's much better than anything we've seen in the last 25
years,'' said Lawrence Katz, an economist at Harvard and a former
chief economist at the Labor Department. Some economists think the
long-term trends driving down pay at the bottom of the ladder may
be abating.
</P>
<P>
   Federal help for the working poor adds to the payoff. ``Between
the Bush and Clinton administrations, subsidies to working poor
have exploded,'' said Douglas J. Besharov of the American
Enterprise Institute. And day care subsidies have mushroomed.
</P>
<P>
   Cities and states, meanwhile, have stopped making welfare checks
available to single men, as some have done since the 1960s, and
Washington has dropped single men from eligibility for food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   The push to move many single mothers off welfare also seems to
be changing domestic arrangements in ways promoting work among
young black males. At least half who leave the rolls depart not for
jobs but to move in with someone else, often a husband or
boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are some of those 50 percent telling boyfriends, `If you
expect to continue this relationship, you'd better get a job'?''
Besharov asked rhetorically. ``It's a plausible story, for which
there's very little evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   More important, the main alternative to work _ crime _ has
become a much less attractive way to make a living. The crack
cocaine trade has collapsed. Estimates of hourly pay in the
illegal-drug business suggest that it is surprisingly low, perhaps
not much more than the current minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   And the police in cities like New York have gotten savvier as
well as tougher, said James Q. Wilson of the University of
California at Los Angeles. So crime rates are down sharply in many
cities.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bruce Weinberg, an economist at Ohio State
University, there is some evidence that a more vibrant job market
for low-skilled workers means fewer muggings, burglaries, car
thefts and other property crimes. But the direction of causation
probably goes the other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crime may cause poverty,'' wrote Abigail and Stephan
Thernstrom in their book, ``America in Black and White.'' They cite
evidence that crime is a major reason employers leave the inner
city, and a strong reason some employers are reluctant to hire
young black men, whether they have criminal records or have merely
been stereotyped.
</P>
<P>
   The gains of the 1980s boom may have evaporated so quickly
because of crack cocaine. In the late 1980s, a well-known study of
young black men in Massachusetts by Katz and his colleague Richard
Freeman found that, even though many more found jobs when the
overall unemployment rate fell below 3 percent, two-thirds _ twice
the proportion of five years earlier _ said their chances of making
a good living were better on the streets than in legitimate jobs.
That fraction has probably declined.
</P>
<P>
   For young black men today, ``having less of a criminal record
and more of a work record is a good sign for when they're older,''
said Katz.
</P>
<P>
   Besharov added, ``The strong economy primes the pump, but as
people change attitudes and build up their ability for work, some
of the gains are going to stick.''

RULING AWAITED ON EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED BIN LADEN AIDE
</HEADLINE>
   (rl) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A German official said Friday that his government has received
indications from U.S. officials that they will not seek the death
penalty for a suspected aide to Osama bin Laden, which could clear
a major hurdle to win the man's extradition from Germany.
</P>
<P>
   German law prohibits extradition of suspects to countries where
they could face charges carrying the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, Germany's highest court dismissed an appeal by
the suspected aide, Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, who has been fighting
extradition since his arrest three months ago in Munich on charges
of conspiring to murder Americans abroad and use weapons of mass
destruction. Salim, 40, has denied the charges or that he is a
member of any terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
   American officials would not confirm the German account Friday
night, but the German official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said that Salim could be turned over to face charges in
New York within a week or two. German officials must still receive
formal word from the United States, he said, and also review
Friday's court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The extradition process involving Salim may force American
prosecutors to take a public position on the death penalty earlier
than they had wanted and to rule it out in at least one
high-profile prosecution where they may have felt it was
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   It also sets up the possibility that some defendants accused of
being high-ranking associates of bin Laden would escape capital
prosecution, while other more junior operatives would face
execution if they are convicted. Bin Laden is suspected of
masterminding the bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania last August and other acts of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors in Manhattan told a federal judge on Oct. 8 that
``the death penalty will seriously be considered'' in the case of
two other defendants who were arrested after the embassy bombings.
</P>
<P>
   The two men, Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali and Mohammed Saddiq
Odeh, have each been charged with separate counts of murder in the
deaths of more than 200 people in the attacks. Each man has pleaded
innocent.
</P>
<P>
   But neither man has been portrayed by prosecutors in the kind of
senior position which the government contends Salim had in the
organization run by bin Laden. Salim has been described in
government documents as a close associate of bin Laden who managed
the group's finances, tried to buy material for nuclear weapons,
and worked with officials of Sudan in a joint-weapons production
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers for other suspects charged in the case refused
comment Friday, and Salim's lawyer in Germany could not be reached
by phone for comment.
</P>
<P>
   But experts in the federal death penalty law said that if the
government rules out a capital prosecution for Salim, and for a
second suspect awaiting extradition from Britain, it may make it
easier for the lawyers for Odeh and al-'Owhali to argue that it
should be ruled out in the case of their clients as well.
</P>
<P>
   One of the mitigating factors which the Justice Department is
required to consider in deciding whether to seek capital
punishment, the experts said, is whether other equally culpable
defendants in a crime will not be punished by death.
</P>
<P>
   A final decision on whether to seek the death penalty, in any
case, is made by Attorney General Janet Reno, after receiving a
recommendation from the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, Mary Jo White.

   TOP JAPAN BROKERAGE CUTS U.S. BUSINESS
</P>
<P>
   Nomura Holding America, an arm of Japan's biggest brokerage
house, said it would abandon the commercial real-estate lending
business that it helped to pioneer in the mid-1990s. Nomura's once
highly profitable Capital Company of America, hurt by steep losses
earlier this year, will sell its enormous inventory of loans, lay
off half of its 400 employees and centralize operations in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The change of fortune at Nomura will have an impact on
commercial real-estate developers, who will lose one of the most
eager lenders in the business. Over the past six years, Capital
America made more than $32 billion in loans.
</P>
<P>
   BIG PAYOUT FOR TOBACCO LAWYERS
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers who represented the first states to settle with the
tobacco industry over health-care costs were awarded $8.2 billion
in fees, the richest legal payday in the United States' history.
The money, to be divided among dozens of lawyers who represented
Florida, Mississippi and Texas, is the first to result from a
series of tobacco cases that culminated last month in a $206
billion settlement between tobacco companies and 46 states and five
U.S. territories.
</P>
<P>
   STOCKS END MIXED AS BONDS FALL
</P>
<P>
   Stocks ended mixed after Coca-Cola warned that profits would not
meet forecasts. The Dow industrials fell 19.82, to 8,821.76, while
the S&AMP;P 500 and the Nasdaq composite posted small gains. Stocks
pared earlier losses after President Clinton said he would address
the nation after the close of trading. Bonds posted their biggest
loss in more than a month as Seagram sold $3.5 billion of debt.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER PRICES DROP IN NOVEMBER
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government said producer prices fell 0.2 percent in
November as energy costs retreated and food prices registered their
biggest drop in more than a year. It was the biggest decline since
August, and essentially offset the October increase of 0.2 percent.
Another report showed that retail sales rose 0.6 percent in
November, the fourth consecutive monthly increase.

   STORM OVER A MEXICAN BANKER
</P>
<P>
   As Mexico's finance minister, Guillermo Ortiz won acclaim for
steering the country through a fiscal storm. Now he is at the
center of a controversy that has brought Mexico's young democracy
to a high-risk impasse. A demand by an opposition group that Ortiz
resign as head of the Banco de Mexico has shaken the country's
markets, left the banks in limbo and rattled international
investors.
</P>
<P>
   REFORM STRUGGLE IN BRAZIL CONGRESS
</P>
<P>
   With a $41.5 billion bailout from the International Monetary
Fund in the offing, the world watched nervously as Brazil's
Congress faced an important vote on measures to cut the pension
deficit. But unlike last year, when the Asian collapse prompted
instant, total cooperation from Congress, the government of
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso now faces a tougher fight to
push through unpopular economic measures.
</P>
<P>
   $1.4 BILLION CELLULAR DEAL
</P>
<P>
   The stock of Cellular Communications International jumped $4.25,

 &HT;    Deal frees up company to narrow focus
 &HT;    By Mickey H. Gramig
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Just over a month ago, one of Cadbury Schweppes' top
executives told industry colleagues of the difficulty his company
faced getting its soft drinks to market.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining its No. 1 position in the non-cola arena, where its
brands outsell Coca-Cola and Pepsico products, was an uphill battle
given the ``predatory'' competitive environment, John F. Brock,
Cadbury Schweppes' managing director and chief executive of global
beverages, told executives at InterBev, the soft drink industry's
largest trade show.
</P>
<P>
   That battle will be over _ except in the United States, France
and South Africa _ now that the London-based company is selling its
beverage brands in 120 countries. It's also seeking buyers for most
of its bottling network, which is estimated to be worth about $800
million.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will make Cadbury Schweppes stonger, said Chief
Executive John Sunderland, who explained that proceeds from the
$1.85 billion deal with Coca-Cola Co. will help the company grow
its chocolate and confectionery business while expanding operations
where its beverage sales are strongest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have substantial financial flexibility and this, in
turn, will give us freedom to develop our brands and markets around
the world,'' he said in a release.
</P>
<P>
   Sunderland, who took over the company in 1996, approached
Coca-Cola more than a year ago with his offer to sell the brands.
Though rivals, the two companies have a history of working together
through bottling agreements in both the United States and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   For example, about 24 percent of the company's U.S. volume flows
through Coca-Cola's vast bottling system. In addition, M. Douglas
Ivester, Coca-Cola's chairman and chief executive, helped shepherd
a deal with Cadbury in the 1980s that created a jointly operated
bottler in England. That operation was sold to Atlanta-based
Coca-Cola Enterprises in June 1996 for $1.85 billion.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Coca-Cola agreed to shell out that same amount after
months of top-secret discussions and lawyering every angle of the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and industry insiders hailed Cadbury Schweppes' action,
which pushed up the company's stock 8 percent Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were a significant player in a few markets, but overall,
outside the United States, they were a distant third in the soft
drink battle,'' said Gary Hemphill, a consultant with New
York-based Beverage Marketing Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The deal ``sorts out the places where Cadbury's systems weren't
strong enough to compete with Coca-Cola,'' David Lang, an analyst
at Henderson Crosthwaite in London, told Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were fighting with Pepsico for their market share. It was
a murderous battle, and they were getting nowhere with it. This
gives them a war chest for investment and for buying back shares.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal will affect about 450 Cadbury Schweppes employees, who
will have the opportunity to take jobs with Coca-Cola, the company
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good news from a strategic point of view,'' Julia Bannon,
an analyst at Paribas in London, also told Bloomberg. ``It's
another example of how Cadbury is refocusing. If you look at the
share price, the market is telling us it thinks it's great.''
</P>
<P>
   Cadbury Schweppes' brands will have more opportunity to grow
worldwide through the Coca-Cola system, said Beverage Digest Editor
John Sicher.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a deal that works for both parties,'' he said. ``And
it will give them an infusion of a substantial amount of money to
continue to do two things: Build their brands in the U.S. and
perhaps even more importantly, to continue to consolidate the
independent bottling system.''
</P>
<P>
   That independent ``third-tier'' bottling system now handles 44
percent of Cadbury Schweppes' U.S. distribution, while Pepsico
bottlers distribute 32 percent, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could be acquisitions in the future to strengthen that
distribution system. We never talk about potential business
transactions until we're ready to announce them,'' said Michael A.
Martin, a spokesman for Cadbury Schweppes' Plano, Texas-based U.S.
division.
</P>
<P>
   The company has made recent moves to strengthen its U.S.
distribution pipeline, to become a stronger player in the country's
$55 billion soft drink market.
</P>
<P>
   In February, it entered a joint venture with U.S.-based Carlyle
Group to acquire two soft drink bottlers, Beverage America and
Select Beverages, for $724 million. And just last month, the joint
venture group bought a Cleveland bottler for an undisclosed price.
</P>
<P>
   Hemphill, of Beverage Marketing Group, said the U.S. operation
will likely stick to acquiring bottlers, rather than soft drink
brands, given that its portfolio is so large.
</P>

   ``They've got brands that compete within categories,'' he said,
citing as examples the company's Sunkist and Crush orange drinks
and Hires, IBC and A&AMP;W root beers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got their hands full with trying to keep their
existing brands on store shelves,'' Hemphill said. ``They've done a
good job with that, given that they don't own the distribution
system.''

COMMENTARY: IN NO HURRY FOR NEXT LEG OF JOURNEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The waning afternoon sunlight slipped into the rooms
of Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. Outside, the trees looked like
propped-up sticks, gray, crooked and ready for winter. Inside, it
was warm and quiet, in anticipation of a bigger chill. Michael
Burke lay in his bed, the latest stop in a medical journey that
started in September with treatment at another hospital for a
cancer that spread from his colon to his lung and brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctors think I'm terminal,'' he said. ``I think I'm
terminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Calvary Hospital bills itself as the United States' only
specialty hospital for adults in the final stages of advanced
cancer. It is not a hospice, since its patients require a doctor's
constant attention to stabilize them and ease their pain. Doctors
tend to nearly every aspect of a patient's physical and emotional
comfort as well as helping families that are emotionally battered
by the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at Calvary, which started almost 100 years ago in a
Greenwich Village house, see their work as a counterpoint to those
who advocate ``a definitive medical response'' to terminal illness.
In plain English, they offer the dying patient an alternative to
assisted suicide. It's not a place that Dr. Jack Kevorkian, who was
ordered this week to stand trial on murder charges for his role in
a suicide shown on television, has ever visited.
</P>
<P>
   Burke, 45, a mechanical contractor, understands how frustration
and despair drive some people to suicide, even if they have
received the best care. But he does not consider that an option,
and he is alarmed by Kevorkian's increasingly brazen attempts to
force the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems seriously aggressive about it,'' Burke said. ``But
what constitutes the envelope of what he considers candidates for
euthanasia would become bigger and bigger. I think people need to
make it difficult for guys like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Calvary operates under the auspices of the Roman Catholic
Archdiocese of New York, so its opposition to suicide hews to
church teaching. Its patients _ 200 on any given day _ represent
many faiths. In rare cases, critically ill patients arrive at the
hospital asking for a quick end. More common are feelings of
depression or emotional suffering, which, if not addressed by
doctors, psychiatrists and social workers, could lead to desperate
yearnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depression is more painful than physical pain,'' said Dr.
Michael Brescia, the hospital's medical director. ``Emotional
suffering is the absence of love. This is a time when people have
to say final farewells to their children. There are no more
holidays. No future. You're not in this life, you're on the outside
looking in. Everybody else has a life and you don't have one. Most
people, if they ask for suicide, it's from the emotional aspects of
this disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Those emotional hardships, doctors said, aren't made any easier
by the difficulties patients have in persuading their
health-maintenance organizations to allow them to seek appropriate
care in other hospitals, or at least let them check into Calvary
when death is near. Dr. James Cimino, director of Calvary's
palliative-care institute, said the medical runaround has been
exploited by proponents of assisted suicide, who present euthanasia
as a dignified response to the indignities of the health-care
bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevorkian forced us as a society to ask why people want to die
prematurely,'' Cimino said. ``But we should have confronted it
before.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows that other doctors _ good, well-meaning ones _ also
support euthanasia. But each day he sees patients who resist an
early demise. ``Maybe it's something about the nature of the person
that they have this suffering, yet they don't request suicide,'' he
said. ``I don't want to get into the philosophy of that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Burke does.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevorkian is assuming there's nothing out there after this,''
he said. ``I assume there is. I think that's where we part
company.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that as long as he was comfortable _ and he was _ he had
no problem. Suicide, he said, would be unfair to his wife and two
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want them to believe Daddy had the option of
pushing this button and leaving,'' he said. ``I'm not trying to
squeeze every last moment. But if I can live for a week and see my
son one more time, I would. As opposed to seeing Kevorkian this
afternoon. Not that I think they would let him in the door here.''
</P>
<P>
   He gave a small smile and a thumbs-up sign. The gesture was his
own definitive response.

<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ As the House Judiciary Committee voted Friday
night to impeach President Clinton, Rep. Robert Livingston, the
incoming speaker of the House, continued to avoid specifics on the
whole topic.
</P>
<P>
   He said in a brief interview here Friday that he had been
deliberately vague with democrats and the press about whether he
would allow a censure vote by the full House and would likely not
address the matter publicly until the Judiciary Committee issued a
report, expected Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he had told Rep. Dick Gephardt, the Democratic
leader, that he would not allow a vote on censure, Livingston said,
``Actually I haven't been very clear. I haven't been any more clear
with him than I have with you _ deliberately so. I haven't given
him anything definitive.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke Friday night after a reception honoring his
``becoming'' speaker, but in the interview referred to Newt
Gingrich as the speaker, which he technically is until Livingston
takes over January 6.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would talk with Rep. Henry Hyde, chairman of the
Judiciary Committee, ``to get an idea what's going to be in the
report. Then I'll set the agenda and I'm working with the speaker.
Remember, anything I do is contingent on agreement with the
speaker.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Gephardt, in an interview in Washington,
voiced his strongest criticism of Livingston to date for, in his
view, failing to take the reigns of the speakership.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a good start,'' Gephardt said. ``I guess he can say
he's not in charge and it is speaker Gingrich's call. But the truth
is, once a speaker leaves, a new speaker takes over. He's not just
there for the majority _ he's there for the whole house.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt has been urging Livingston to allow a vote of censure
on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston was being honored here at a reception hosted by The
National Association of Realtors and other business leaders. As
guests snacked on hors d'oevres of quiche and shrimp, Livingston
told them only: ``We have a few things to take care of in
Washington, and that's enough said about that.''
</P>
<P>
   He seemed blissfully unaware of the proceedings in Washington,
asking a reporter after the reception whether the Judiciary
Committee had finished voting.
</P>
<P>
   Told it had not, he said he would talk to Hyde ``after the dust
settles.''

AGGRESSIVE REAL ESTATE LENDER REVERSES COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (rl) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After hitting the jackpot in innovative real estate lending
during the mid-1990s and then watching most of its gains evaporate
in a month, Nomura Holding America, the U.S. arm of Japan's biggest
brokerage house, plans to get out of the business it helped
pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   Nomura has decided that San Francisco-based Capital Company of
America, its once highly profitable real estate finance subsidiary,
will cease making new loans and devote itself exclusively to
selling a record-setting inventory of existing loans, estimated by
the company Friday at more than $10 billion. The Japanese firm also
plans to lay off about half of Capital America's 400 employees and
centralize operations in New York, shutting most branch offices.
</P>
<P>
   American operations of Nomura Securities lost $1.16 billion in
the March-September period, dragging the Tokyo-based parent company
into the red. Much of that loss came from write-downs of the value
of Capital America's real estate portfolio, a collection of loans
that financed shopping malls, hotels and other developments around
the country. The company thrived by lumping such loans into
packages and selling them to investors, but the market turned sour
in August and September.
</P>
<P>
   The change of fortune for Nomura has already led to the
resignation of Ethan Penner, Capital America's founder and vice
chairman. He made the company one of America's leading commercial
real estate lenders and in his heyday had compensation packages
that ranked among the highest in Wall Street history.
</P>
<P>
   But Nomura executives from London and Tokyo who reviewed the
U.S. operation over the last six weeks determined that the business
_ in which the company sometimes held billions of dollars in loans
on its own books before selling them as securities _ was too risky,
people involved in the review said. They also concluded that the
huge profits of the once cutting-edge business were unlikely to
return soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good run for six years,'' said Michael Hurdelbrink,
Capital America's new chief executive and a member of the review
team. ``But we asked whether this business can continue to generate
the returns we want in the future, and the answer is no.''
</P>
<P>
   The closing will affect commercial real estate developers, who
will lose one of their most eager lenders. In six years, Capital
America made more than $32 billion in loans, sometimes to customers
who were turned away from big commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Nomura's exit would not seriously harm the
business of turning real estate loans into commercial
mortgage-backed securities. But developers will have fewer choices,
said Gale Scott, a managing director in real estate finance for
Standard &AMP; Poor's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will probably see the loan volume drop and there will be
fewer originators,'' she said. ``The tables are turning in the
industry and it's becoming more of a lender's market.''
</P>
<P>
   Nomura's decision to stop new lending is good news for some
other major players in that market. Many securities firms,
including Goldman, Sachs; Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, and Lehman
Brothers piled into the commercial mortgage-backed securities
market in recent years _ many of them tempted by Penner's early
success. Some are now cutting jobs and reducing the capital they
devote to the business.
</P>
<P>
   Hurdelbrink, 55, a veteran of Nomura's operation in London
before being appointed to head Capital America late last month,
said he would spend the next several weeks developing a new
business plan and deciding about staff cuts.
</P>
<P>
   He said in a telephone interview that the firm's main task would
be selling off the inventory of real estate loans, which analysts
described as easily the largest in industry.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Nomura's commercial mortgage-backed securities now trade
at a discount to comparable securities from rival firms because
Nomura was perceived to be a big risk taker, industry rivals said,
making it harder for the Japanese company to reduce inventory
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Hurdelbrink said there would be no fire sale. ``Nomura has the
capital and the patience and discipline to carry the assets,'' he
said. ``Let's face it: We are not without negative attention
recently and we need to stabilize the company first.''

 DiMAGGIO ONE OF THE ONLY TRUES HEROES OF SPORTS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ For one game in 1951, when Casey Stengel was manager
of the Yankees and Joe DiMaggio's well-worn legs made chasing down
fly balls in Yankee Stadium too tough on the 36-year-old center
fielder, Stengel moved DiMaggio to first base.
</P>
<P>
   It happens all the time. Aging outfielders get brought in to
first, to keep their bat in the lineup, to keep them part of the
team.
</P>
<P>
   Only DiMaggio would have nothing to do with diminishing skills,
a slow decline.
</P>
<P>
   That one game told DiMaggio what he needed to know about his
baseball career. As he stood on first, perhaps worried sick he
would flub a routine grounder, the story goes that DiMaggio sweated
straight through his uniform.
</P>
<P>
   At age 36, he knew what he would do.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1951 World Series, which the Yankees won for the ninth
time in DiMaggio's 13 seasons, the Yankees tried to get DiMaggio to
play one more season. But on Dec. 12, 1951 _ exactly 47 years ago
today _ DiMaggio read his retirement statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been unusually privileged to play all my major league
baseball for the New York Yankees,'' he said. ``It has been a
greater privilege to play baseball at all.'
</P>
<P>
   Such class. Always.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since October and the 1998 World Series, when Joe DiMaggio
was too sick to make it to Yankee Stadium to throw out the first
pitch, too sick to grace us with his dignified, classy,
well-dressed-as-ever presence, the news of DiMaggio's decline in a
Florida hospital has kept the world on notice.
</P>
<P>
   How is the Yankee Clipper doing?
</P>
<P>
   Every day since October, his 84th birthday on Nov. 25th among
them, the world was watching.
</P>
<P>
   You did not have to be a Yankee fan to feel that the dying light
of Joe DiMaggio reduces the earthly shine around us all. That's why
news of DiMaggio rallying from a deep coma yesterday and squeezing
the hand of his doctor was just more affirmation of the strength
and determination of this man.
</P>
<P>
   You did not have to be a Yankee fan to root for DiMaggio _ one
of the only true heroes of sports _ because he understood what it
meant to be proud, to never let anyone down.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might be a kid in the stands who has never seen me play,
or would never see me play again. I burned to be the best for them,
to leave them with a good memory of me,'' DiMaggio once told a
reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving a good memory . . . no question DiMaggio long ago
accomplished that with his image so noble, so immaculate, it makes
you wonder how only half a century separates DiMaggio from the
arrogant, ego-driven, pay-to-play ``stars'' of today.
</P>
<P>
   Light years are a better way to calculate the distance between
DiMaggio and Albert Belle or J.D. Drew or even the gentle Bernie
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The newest Yankee center fielder, Williams finally agreed to
take $12 million to play ball out there near the monuments and the
ghosts of Yankee Stadium. Once upon a time, it was a boy's biggest
dream to get to play center field for the Yankees, just like
DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in the last few years, DiMaggio was asked how he would
handle George Steinbrenner if ever DiMaggio had the occasion to
negotiate a deal with the Yankee boss. DiMaggio reportedly said he
would walk into Steinbrenner's office and begin with, ``Hello,
partner.''
</P>
<P>
   Quite a civil, novel idea. Maybe this tactic is something
today's agent-shackled players could try, in honor of Joltin' Joe
DiMaggio, who stayed around the game, handsome, royal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being in the New York organization like I was for 15 years, I
had a chance to get to know Joe,'' Mariner manager Lou Piniella
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you, it was always a thrill. And, yes, Joe liked
his privacy, but he liked to talk baseball, especially with other
players. He shared a lot of insights. He didn't like to talk about
his career, but out of all the Yankee greats, he had the most aura
about him. He carried himself with class. Quiet class.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the things DiMaggio did not want to talk about was, of
course, The Streak. Despite the frenzy that surrounded Mark
McGwire, Sammy Sosa and the pursuit of the home run record this
season, it is DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak that most baseball
people consider the toughest record in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly as stunning as his fabled streak is another DiMaggio
statistic that demonstrates his unparalled discipline as a hitter:
In 13 seasons, DiMaggio jolted 361 homers and struck out only 369
times _ an almost unfathomable 1-to-1 ratio.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you have to remember, Yankee Stadium was the toughest park
around for a right-handed hitter,'' Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 440 feet to straightaway center, 420 to left-center. To
strike out that few times and hit all those homers shows you how
great a ballplayer he was, what kind of hand-eye coordination he
had.''
</P>
<P>
   What an eye. For clothes, for style, for poise, for wives.
Whatever element, if any, was missing to launch DiMaggio's legend
into the stratosphere, his romance and marriage to Marilyn Monroe
took care of that. A baseball god and a movie star, ingrained in
our American heritage.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio, to this day, has never denied that the rose placed
daily upon Marilyn Monroe's grave is done so at his request. The
mystique lives. The class. Always.

BROWN'S COMEBACK COMPLETE WITH GIANTS
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ At this time two years ago, Gary Brown
was doing nothing. He had quit pro football, and he had no job, no
ambition and no recriminations. Fortunately for him and the New
York Giants, he also was bored.
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward to Friday, with the Giants (5-8) preparing for
Sunday's game here against the Denver Broncos (13-0). The Giants'
running back will be the same Gary Brown, who has 736 yards rushing
this season, ninth best in the National Football Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has his priorities in order. He is 29 and a seventh-year
pro from Penn State. At 5 feet 11 inches and 230 pounds, he is at
the top of his game. He showed that in the Giants' 23-19 victory
over the Arizona Cardinals last Sunday, when he rushed 25 times for
124 yards, the most by a Giant in three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like him,'' Giants coach Jim Fassel said after Friday's
practice. ``I like the way he's coming along. I like what he's done
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel also likes what an alert front office did in acquiring
Brown. For a time, Brown seemed like a lost cause. He played five
seasons for the Houston Oilers, including a 1993 season in which he
rushed for 1,002 yards. But he injured his right ankle in 1994 and
his left knee in 1995, and his career screeched to a stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those injuries washed out two seasons,'' Brown said. ``I was
frustrated, so in 1996 I just sat it out. I just wasn't enjoying
football. It's odd, but those things happen. Everybody goes through
letdowns during their life. Sometimes you've got to go through
adversity before you know what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat around the whole season. I wasn't working, just
relaxing, and toward the end it got boring. So before the playoffs,
I told my agent, Tony Agnone, that I wanted to play again. He got
me to San Diego, and I rushed for 945 yards there last year, but
they wanted to do something else this year. Dallas, Cincinnati and
the Giants were interested in me, and I chose the Giants because
they were close to my home in Williamsport, Pa., and it was a good
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants needed help at running back. Tiki Barber was erratic
and not built for heavy duty. Tyrone Wheatley, who had the size,
was often nicked, and the coaches questioned his dedication. So
during April's draft, the Giants moved. They agreed with Agnone on
a modest contract for Brown of $325,000 for one year.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for Brown's success has been his fumble-proof game.
Since December 1993, after the last carry of his last game for the
Oilers, he has had 728 rushes and 59 receptions without a fumble.
</P>
<P>
   After this season, he becomes a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't give you any reason why I wouldn't want him back next
year,'' Fassel said.
</P>
<P>
   And Giants executive vice president John Mara said: ``He's
someone we're interested in keeping. He has had a productive year,
in a year when the offense hasn't been productive.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he wanted to remain a Giant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I want to come back,'' he said. ``I enjoy it here. I
enjoy being close to home.''
</P>
<P>
   If a new contract is worked out, as everyone thinks it will, the
Giants will retain their premier runner.
</P>
<P>
   How good is Brown? In the words of Tito Wooten, the safety who
plays against him every day in practice, ``When he runs, the first
man who reaches him is going to take punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown agrees. Listen to this autobiographical scouting report:
</P>
<P>
   ``On the field, I'm a strong inside runner, with a lot of power
inside. People underestimate my quickness. I can take chunks of
yardage if you give the ball to me. Off the field, I'm just a
laid-back, easy guy, not complicated. This is my life. I love to
play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   --JIM FASSEL downgraded defensive tackle ROBERT HARRIS (strained
left calf) and running back TYRONE WHEATLEY (strained hip flexor)
from questionable to very doubtful for Sunday's game. CHRISTIAN
PETER will start for Harris. Wheatley has been inactive for much of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   --After Friday's practice, MIKE CHERRY, a backup quarterback,
threw passes to JOHN FASSEL, the coach's 6-foot-4{-inch son. The
younger Fassel, soon to graduate from Weber State, is a wide
receiver who will play in the Blue-Gray game Christmas Day in
Montgomery, Ala. &QL;

   HOLLYWOOD, Fla. _ After lapsing into a coma overnight, Joe
DiMaggio revived Friday afternoon, moving his head and squeezing
his doctor's hand. But the doctor said DiMaggio's condition
remained very serious and could change at any time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a very dire situation,'' Dr. Earl Barron said.
</P>
<P>
   This is the fourth time DiMaggio's condition has been termed
critical, and Barron described DiMaggio's status as a ``roller
coaster ride.'' He said that on three previous occasions, the Hall
of Famer rebounded with the help of antibiotics and the suctioning
of an infected lung.
</P>
<P>
   Early Friday morning, Barron offered little hope of recovery as
he made his bluntest assessment of DiMaggio's condition since the
former Yankee center fielder entered Memorial Regional Hospital
here on Oct. 12. He said DiMaggio had a temperature of 102 and
deepening pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a chest C.T. _ that's a special X-ray of the chest _
showing the pneumonia has actually worsened,'' Barron said. ``It's
just unfortunately resistant to our antibiotics, and his general
debilitated condition has contributed to the fact that he can't
fight it.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about DiMaggio's chance of recovery, the doctor said:
``Our outlook is very, very poor. I mean, we're talking about not a
very long time, I don't think.''
</P>
<P>
   Barron, a cardiologist for 33 years, said that DiMaggio had been
his most noteworthy case of resilience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a lot of tough cases over the years,'' he said, ``but
not one who continues to survive like he has. He's been amazing in
that he's survived all the things he's gone through. But I think
that he's finally met his match.''
</P>
<P>
   Barron said he and several other doctors treating DiMaggio
thought about trying a different procedure on the 84-year-old on
Thursday, but decided against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing really to be done,'' he said. ``In evaluating
the C.T. scan, thinking there was some extra fluid in his lung we
could remove, we saw there was not enough that would make any
difference, and we could end up aggravating him by trying.''
</P>
<P>
   He said DiMaggio's blood pressure and heart and kidney functions
were good, but that his lungs were in poor condition and were
``causing us major problems.'' He also said DiMaggio's pneumonia
was more severe, which had raised his temperature.
</P>
<P>
   On whether DiMaggio's latest setback was more dire than the
other three, Barron said Friday morning, ``This is about as low as
you can get.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 representing a
complete recovery, DiMaggio moved from a 0.5 in the morning to a 1
in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Barron has been with DiMaggio daily now for 61 days, day and
night.
</P>
<P>
   He said it has been hard not to be emotional, with DiMaggio such
a beloved figure around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one of those things,'' he said. ``You've got cancer
and you develop pneumonia post-operatively and unfortunately you
get one of the horrendous organisms, and that's what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio underwent lung cancer surgery on Oct. 14 and has since
dealt with pneumonia and precipitous, life-threatening drops in his
blood pressure on three occasions _ Nov. 16, Nov. 28 and last
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Barron advised on Monday that DiMaggio's family and close
friends be called, with the apparent end in sight. From California
came his two granddaughters _ Paula and Cathy _ along with their
husbands and two children each. Joe Nachio, who says he has been
DiMaggio's friend for 56 years, came from Panama. DiMaggio's
brother Dom, two years younger than Joe and a daily visitor, made
yet another trip down from Boynton Beach, a 45-minute ride from
here. Morris Engelberg, DiMaggio's friend for 15 years, rounded out
the inner sanctum.
</P>
<P>
   The family was contemplating whether to sign a D.N.R. consent
form _ standing for do not resuscitate _ in case DiMaggio's heart
stops beating. He remains on life support systems, and Barron said
he would live about 30 minutes without them. DiMaggio's family has
asked doctors to keep him on life support.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty much down to the power of prayer,'' Engelberg
said.

ON LONG ISLAND, FANS SOAR WITH THEIR RESURGENT JETS

   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ ``So these two guys are sitting at a bar,''
said an old gambler who gave his name only as Kenny to his friend
Bobby Hingard, a New York Jets fan who was sitting at that same bar
in the Double H Pub, by the Mineola train station.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was during the football strike in '82,'' Kenny continued
after a sip of Budweiser. ``They got nothing to bet on. There ain't
no football. Nothing. So they start watching the trains go by. With
lack of anything better to do, they start betting money on the last
number painted on the end of the last train. And it wasn't nickel
and dime stuff. They were betting a couple hundred bucks, and that
was back in '82.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby laughed and gagged on a smoke. ``Thank God we don't have
to do that anymore. We have the Jets. J-E-T-S. Jets. Jets. Jets.
You a Jets fan, Kenny?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jets? I am now that Parcells is coach. Couldn't say I was a
couple a years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   So the conversation goes here in the middle of Jets country on
Long Island. For the first time in a long time there is something
to cheer about.
</P>
<P>
   In the '90s, the Jets have been terrible, really terrible.
December used to mean the end to another losing season. Now it
means something, a potential playoff spot. A place the Jets haven't
been since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, the Jets take on their archrivals, the Miami
Dolphins, in Florida. It is Dan Marino, the Dolphins' quarterback,
vs. the Jets' Vinnie Testaverde. Bill Parcells against Jimmy
Johnson. With a victory, the Jets walk into the playoffs. A loss
could mean another winter of woulda-coulda-shoulda.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday night, the Dolphins were favored. Jets fans figure
that means easy money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, we got a lock,'' Kenny said.
</P>
<P>
   Even last season, after years of futility, the Jets could have
made the playoffs by beating Detroit in the final regular season
game. But a couple of tough calls by the officials, a disastrous
quarterback switch by Parcells, and with Detroit running back Barry
Sanders running over them like a one-man stampede, the Jets spent
January at home.
</P>
<P>
   Another disaster in a long line of disasters.
</P>
<P>
   This year it's different, they are saying here in Long Island.
The Jets fans have finally returned. The Giants belong to
Manhattan, they say. The Jets are for Long Island. After all, Gang
Green used to play at Shea Stadium in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   The team up and left for the swamp in 1984. The Meadowlands. And
that broke everyone's heart, considering that it was a two-hour
round trip to New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Hardships piled up. The double-overtime playoff loss to the
Cleveland Browns in 1987. The playoff shutout by Miami in 1983,
when lineman A.J. Duhe ran back an interception 35 yards in the mud
for a touchdown. Dan Marino rubbing salt in their wounds again when
he pretended to spike the ball but instead threw for a touchdown in
1994. The next two seasons, with Rich Kotite as coach, when the
Jets posted a cumulative record of 4-28. Last year's Detroit loss.
The flop of the false-messiah quarterbacks: Boomer Esiason, Neil
O'Donnell, Glenn Foley.
</P>
<P>
   It got so bad that Long Islanders began buying cable and
satellite dishes to watch other teams, so their Sunday dinners
would not be ruined by having to watch Jets games on regular
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of fair-weather friends, that's for sure,'' said
Tank Passuello, 59, the former owner of Bill's Meadowbrook, now
Bogart's, the old-time watering hole of the Jets players, across
the street from their practice field at Hofstra University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started getting tired of the bar business, especially when
the Jets started getting lousy around '76. But I've always been a
Jet fan. Go to the games every year, yes I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Passuello has been a fan since the Jets were known as the New
York Titans of the old American Football League. He claims that Joe
Namath first guaranteed victory to him, two nights before the team
left for Super Bowl III in Miami in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   At 6 feet 2 inches and 285 pounds, Passuello got his nickname
when as a freshman center at Hofstra, he was hit by a Renault. The
car was destroyed. The Tank ripped his pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a football fan is a lot like being a football player,''
he said. ``Longevity requires perseverance. Us old-time fans are
finally getting our due.''
</P>
<P>
   And Long Islanders are drunk on the sweet nectar of success. Men
of the cloth lead their congregations in prayer. ``We asked God to
help them climb the mountain,'' said the Rev. Alan Ramirez of the
Brookville Reform Church.
</P>
<P>
   Law students take time from their exams to present their case
for why Jets fans deserve a championship. ``I used to think there
were eight Jets fans in the whole world,'' said Steve Tretola, 23,
of Hofstra Law School, having a drink Friday at Bogart's bar. ``We
suffered. Now? Forget about it.''
</P>
<P>
   About the only negative word comes from Joe Gardi, the football
coach at Hofstra and a former Jets defensive coordinator, who said
he was annoyed to hear ``that the Jets have always been losers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In '82, we were a game from the Super Bowl,'' he said, ``and
we were the toast of the town.''
</P>
<P>
   Even children have put the Jets on their wish lists. At the
Double H Pub, the story is told of Joey Leamy, 9, who asked Grandpa
if Santa prays. Yes, Santa prays, his grandfather, Michael Leamy,
told him. In his Christmas letter to St. Nicholas, Joey wrote:
``Dear Santa. Please pray for the Jets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Have him pray for me,'' said Kenny, the old gambler. ``I got
money on this one.''

   ENTERTAINMENT &AMP; ARTS (Moved in `e' category)
</P>
<P>
   FEATURE story &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-ART (New York) _ The ``Inside Out: New Chinese Art,'' is
an exhibition organized by the Asia Society in Manhattan and
installed there and at the P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center in Long
Island City (through Jan. 3). It is the largest gathering of its
kind in the West to date, and the first to take a broad-spectrum
look at new work from across the Chinese-speaking world, including
the mainland, Taiwan, Hong Kong and artists living abroad. The
result is a sprawling affair, a pileup of media, styles and
philosophies, from brush and ink painting to installation art,
mock-propaganda to Pop, Dada to Daoism, exemplary of a ``global''
art that promises to have increasing visibility in the years to
come. By Holland Cotter. &UR;  &LR; (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   EROTIC-ART-SALE (Undated) _ The trove of ancient erotic art that
Christie's plans to sell on Thursday includes dozens of objects
made between 500 B.C. and 400 A.D. that cannot be described in
detail in a family newspaper. There are couples coupling and single
guys who would be the envy of modern-day single guys _ and who
could have been bigger scene-stealers than the one in last season's
sculpture-class episode of ``Ally McBeal.'' If only they had lived
another 2,000 years. Some of the terms Christie's uses to describe
these items in its 80-page catalogue do not appear in most
dictionaries. By James Barron. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   FILM AND VIDEO
</P>
<P>
   SHAKESPEARE-IN-LOVE-FILM (Undated) _ Many things about William
Shakespeare's life and work are shrouded in mystery, but the
mystery of what scholars call his lost years is one of the most
intriguing of all. What did Shakespeare do between 1585, when he is
known to have left his home in Stratford-on-Avon, and 1592, when he
re-emerged in London. No one knows for sure, and ``Shakespeare in
Love'' provides a fanciful explanation by imagining the young
Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) as a nearly unknown actor and
playwright who finds his poetic voice through a passionate love
affair with one Viola De Lesseps, a woman as clever as she is
beautiful. That Viola never actually existed, and that she is
played by the certifiably American Gwyneth Paltrow (albeit with a
plausible English accent), didn't matter to the filmmakers. The
movie, which opened on Friday, is meant to be a high-entertainment
mix of fact and fiction, combining a modern sensibility with
Shakespearean language and period flourishes, full of the double
meanings and sly jokes that characterize the work of Tom Stoppard,
its co-writer. By Sarah Lyall. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   VIDEO-BOX-SETS (Undated) _ Video boxed sets materialize at the
drop of an anniversary, or given almost any excuse, as long as the
topic coalesces and the story unfolds on two or more cassettes.
Major directors, British comedy and theater, American retro
television, a momentous era, master artists and masters of silent
film: all make notable boxes this year. By Peter M. Nichols.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BAT-WHISPERS-VIDEO (Undated) _ The action may be antiquated, but
its legacy is hard to match. Along with the radio show ``The
Shadow'' and Leonardo da Vinci's flying machines, Roland West's
1930 thriller ``The Bat Whispers'' was a source for the late
cartoonist Bob Kane, who in 1939 created Batman the Caped Crusader
and Robin the Boy Wonder. By Peter M. Nichols. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   DANCE
</P>
<P>
   DANGEROUS-ROOM-DANCE (Undated) _ ``The Most Dangerous Room in
the House,'' by Susan Marshall, will open on Wednesday at the
Brooklyn Academy of Music's Majestic Theater. This vertiginous
78-minute production, her fifth for the academy's Next Wave
Festival in a decade, revolves around a woman tormented by visions
of a child's death. By Christopher Reardon. (Moved). Photo.

<P>
   THEATER

   CANBY-THEATER (Undated) _ Vincent Canby reviews: ``Electra'' and
``Stop Kiss.'' (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   CLASSICAL
</P>
<P>
   OPERA-SINGERS (Undated) _ Opera singers keep showing up in the
wrong places. Sometimes they are good singers: Cecilia Bartoli,
appearing as Susanna in the Metropolitan Opera's ``Marriage of
Figaro''; Renee Fleming, very nearly appearing in the Met's
``Traviata,'' and Patricia Racette, who did appear there. Sometimes
they are not good enough: Marcelo Alvarez, for example, opposite
Ms. Racette, as Alfredo. By Bernard Holland. Moved).
</P>
<P>
   PORGY-AND-BESS (Undated) _ As the millennium approaches, a
pop-inflected, genre-bending, dramatically singular masterpiece of
the 20th century is finally edging into the standard operatic
repertory. Is it Poulenc's ``Dialogues of the Carmelites''?
Shostakovich's ``Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District''? It could
be either, but the opus in question is Gershwin's ``Porgy and
Bess,'' which shares with those mighty works enough visceral
dramatic sweep and power, musical invention and craft, vocally and
theatrically meaty characters, and mythical resonance to match any
of Verdi's middle-period operas. Beginning on Thursday, the New
York Philharmonic offers concert performances of ``Porgy and Bess''
at Avery Fisher Hall, culminating a weeklong Gershwin centenary
celebration and offering a fresh chance to reflect on the piece's
long journey toward high-art status. By Cori Ellison. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ART
</P>
<P>
   GANTRY-PLAZA-ARCH (New York) _ The evil spell is broken. Or so
you may be tempted to think while wandering through Gantry Plaza
State Park, a new waterfront promenade and pleasure ground in Long
Island City. The curse that reduced New York's landscape architects
to creating Disney versions of Central Park has been at least
temporarily lifted. At last, a designer and his client have waked
up and recognized that people expect cities to address a
fundamental question. What time is this place? Designed by Thomas
Balsley, the two-acre park is part of Queens West, the development
project planned for a stretch of the East River opposite the United
Nations Headquarters. By Herbert Muschamp. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   30-YEARS-WAR-ART (Undated) _ To celebrate the treaties of the
30-years-war on their 350th anniversary, a vast exhibition has been
mounted in three sites in Munster and Osnabruck, the Westphalian
cities where the negotiators spent much of the 1640s and where they
finally signed their accords. The exhibition, sponsored by the
Council of Europe and made up of some 1,500 items, opened on Oct.
24 with ceremonies that featured the combatants' descendants in the
persons of 10 kings and queens and 11 other heads of state,
including Vaclav Havel as well as a prince and a grand duke. Far
more than a recollection of the events of 1648, it reaches back
into the 16th-century origins of the fighting; it concludes with a
chilling display of Nazi interpretations of the peace; and in
between it suggests how Europe's political, military and artistic
cultures were transformed by the ravages of a seemingly endless
war. By Theodore K. Rabb. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   FIBERGLASS-ART (Undated) _ Beginning in the late 1960s and
continuing to his death in 1996, Duane Hanson sought to create in
fiberglass and resin a catalogue of American social types _ the
tourist, the waitress, the cowboy. Shamelessly realistic and
reeking of pathos, Hanson's life-size figures, their verisimilitude
enhanced by props suggesting a narrative, were widely popular. But
they never received critical acclaim. A retrospecitive of his work,
``Duane Hanson: A Survey of His Work From the 1930s to the 90s,''
opens on Thursday at the Whitney Museum of American Art. By
Elizabeth Hayt. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TELEVISION
</P>
<P>
   LIFE-OF-CRIME-TV (Undated) _ The moment, brief but breathtaking,
takes place about two-thirds of the way through Jon Alpert's ``Life
of Crime 2.'' A 4-year-old, left alone by his heroin-dazed mother,
balances on the sill of an open window. Three stories below looms
an asphalt parking lot. The scene seems in some ways to define good
documentary filmmaking. Painfully raw, it underscores what Alpert,
a modern master of cinema verite, has spent much of his life
chronicling: the lives of three drug-addicted petty criminals. The
film, which will have its premiere on HBO on Tuesday at 10 P.M., is
considered unlikely to even be considered for an Emmy, a Peabody or
any of the dozens of other awards given each year for documentary
excellence. By Nancy Hass. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   THE-60s-TV (Hollywood) _ NBC's mini-series ``The 60s,'' is
scheduled to be broadcast on Feb. 7 and 8. The series will look at
the life style of the time and the aging baby boomers who took part
in the production. By James Sterngold. (Moved).

US, RUSSIA WORK TO AVERT NUCLEAR WAR BECAUSE OF Y2K BUG

 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Concerned that the year 2000 computer bug might
accidentally set off a nuclear war, the United States and Russia
are hammering out an agreement to station experts in each other's
nuclear command centers next year to prevent miscalculations that
could kill millions of people, according to senior US officials.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is seeking to allay Russian concerns
that a potential breakdown of its computer system caused by the bug
would be misinterpreted by Moscow as an American attack on its
computer defense network. Russian military doctrine anticipates
that a nuclear strike against Moscow would be preceded by an attack
on its military information systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all the radar screens go blank, will they think we did it
and decide to launch a nuclear strike?'' asked Senator Robert F.
Bennett, a Utah Republican who heads the congressional task force
that deals with year 2000 problems.
</P>
<P>
   US military officials met with their Russian counterparts in New
York Friday to reach an agreement. William Curtis, the director of
the Pentagon's year 2000 compliance office, said in an interview
Friday that America would probably have its experts in place in
Moscow by the middle of 1999. He added that the United States is
also in discussions with China, which expressed concerns like those
of the Russians.

<P>
   ``We need to make sure there is no chance someone will be
blindsided if the radar screens of any country using nuclear
weapons go blank,'' said Curtis. ``That is a cause for panic. You
don't know whether it's an attack on your system.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis said the Pentagon is also worried that the 2000 bug will
wreak havoc on the capacity of foreign governments to provide
essential services, threatening everything from urban power grids
to water purification and health care systems.
</P>
<P>
   He said government officials are also concerned that such a
scenario would place enormous demands on the US military to conduct
humanitarian emergency response operations abroad. Curtis said the
Clinton administration sought to persuade other countries at a
major UN conference on year 2000 compliance Friday to intensify
efforts to prepare their computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know there will be some nasty surprises,'' Curtis said.
``But we have to walk a tightrope between provoking panic and
keeping people from going to sleep at the wheel.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly alarmed by the prospects of so-called cyber-warfare
against its military defenses, Russia has proposed that the United
Nations create an international treaty controlling ``information
warfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov wrote to UN Secretary
General Kofi Annan on Sept. 23 warning that dangers posed by
information warfare ``may be comparable to that of weapons of mass
destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot permit the emergence of a fundamentally new area of
international confrontation, which may lead to an escalation of the
arms race based on the latest development of the scientific and
technological revolution,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Russian fears have been fueled in part by an October report from
the Joint Chiefs of Staff stating that American forces will use
``information operations to support our national military
strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians fear that their critical defense systems are
vulnerable to hacking by the United States and other countries,''
said Roger C. Molander, a specialist on cyber-warfare at the Rand
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   American sources say Russia raised the issue of cyber-warfare
with Vice President Al Gore and President Clinton during their
latest visits to Moscow. The issue has also been raised in
closed-door congressional briefings by the CIA, Bennett said. On
Nov. 2, the Clinton administration agreed to begin debate in the UN
General Assembly next year on ``information security.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Curtis insisted that there is no chance a glitch in the
computer network that controls the more than 2,000 US nuclear
missiles could accidentally launch a missile, analysts say there is
considerable uncertainty about what will happen on Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The US system is supposed to be year 2000 compliant by the
year 2000, but we've had people tell us it won't be compliant until
the year 2034,'' said Tanya Padberg, an analyst at the British and
American Information Center. ``If that is the case, what does that
say about the Russian system?''

<P>
   SEATTLE _ Listening to Philip M. Condit and Harry C. Stonecipher
talk about the difficulties facing the Boeing Co., the global
aerospace powerhouse and national icon they jointly run, oddly
brings to mind the feminist battle cry of the 1980s: They just
don't get it.
</P>
<P>
   After an awful year of monumental production foul-ups, $4
billion in unexpected accounting charges and lots of talk about
illusive recovery plans, the news from Boeing only seems to get
worse.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the company stunned investors and its
232,000 employees, more than 40 percent of whom reside here in the
Puget Sound area, with the announcement that it would cut as many
as 48,000 jobs by 2001 _ and still make only a negligible profit.
</P>
<P>
   The news from the nation's single largest exporter rippled
across the country like the storms that pour rain on this city and
then head east.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton weighed in with his concerns about the
company's health. And on Wall Street, shareholders _ who had been
led by Boeing to believe the worst was over _ began selling in
anger, even disgust. Boeing stock closed at $33.125 a share on
Friday after selling for as much as $56.25 in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the great American industrial franchises of the
20th century,'' said John Hayes, an analyst at Independence
Investment Associates, an institutional money manager that sold its
stake of several million Boeing shares last year. ``For the
business to be in this kind of disarray is unfathomable. These guys
have been doing this a long time. They should know how to build
planes at a profit.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet in their first interview since announcing the latest cuts,
Condit, the chairman and chief executive, and Stonecipher, the
president and chief operating officer, spoke last week as if Boeing
had no choice but to make the decisions that have laid it low _ to
sell hundreds of airplanes at cut-rate prices in 1995 and 1996 and
then to nearly triple production rates, from 18 airplanes a month
to the current record rate of 51.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one could have run this place successfully for the last
year,'' said Stonecipher, the former chief executive of McDonnell
Douglas, who joined Boeing after it acquired McDonnell last year
for $16 billion, creating a national monopoly in large passenger
jets and the world's biggest military contractor and aerospace
company, with more than $56 billion in revenues expected this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The systems were overloaded to the point where it doesn't
matter who was in charge,'' he said. ``You could have worked it a
lot of different ways; the result would have been the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Condit's credibility seems especially weak, because he has had
to revise so many of his public positions in the last year. Yet
while contrite, he still has trouble, even in hindsight, viewing
the company's actions as a colossal blunder. ``I think we were very
close to making it,'' he said of the ill-fated ramp-up in
production. ``So it isn't, gosh, you can look back and say, `It was
clear you wouldn't have.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's 13-member board is set to meet Monday in the
wood-paneled boardroom where Condit and Stonecipher were talking.
And for the first time in anyone's memory, as The Seattle Times
pointed out in an editorial last Sunday, the ouster of a Boeing
chief executive is being openly discussed by employees and on Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was on the board, I would be taking a hard look at
whether to keep him,'' said Bill Whitlow, an analyst at Safeco
Asset Management in Seattle and manager of a fund that holds 67,500
Boeing shares.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the outside board members declined to comment; three
did not respond to telephone messages and one other board member
could not be reached. While Condit acknowledged that he was in the
hot seat, he said that he was working harder than ever and that he
didn't think a change at the top made sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are better together than either one of us would be
alone,'' he said, referring to Stonecipher, adding later, ``I could
not imagine a better partner.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, if Condit's days are numbered, Stonecipher, 62, may be
positioned to cap his long career as Boeing's next chairman. That
idea rankles many employees of the old Boeing _ ``heritage
Boeing,'' in the company's post-merger parlance _ because after
years of bruising competition they, not McDonnell Douglas, had
prevailed in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have heard internal comments that, `Hey, we won, but now
they are running the show,' '' Whitlow said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing loyalists especially resent what they see as the heavy
hand of Stonecipher, a blunt talker who became popular on Wall
Street first by turning around the Sundstrand Corp., a maker of
aerospace components, and then by sharply improving McDonnell's
financial performance before selling that company to Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   As Boeing's problems worsened in the last year, Stonecipher's
power appears to have grown. He, rather than Condit, 57, is seen as
the man behind the departures of a number of Boeing executives with
whom Stonecipher is said to have clashed, including the longtime
chief financial officer and the head of the commercial airplane
division.
</P>
<P>
   Stonecipher, who had a large stake in McDonnell Douglas, is now
one of Boeing's largest shareholders; so is John F. McDonnell, the
son of one of McDonnell's founders, who like Stonecipher is on the
Boeing board. Condit, like other board members who came from the
old Boeing, owns relatively little stock.
</P>
<P>
   Investors and analysts credit Stonecipher with sharpening
Boeing's focus on shareholder value. Boeing's decisions to increase
greatly its communication with Wall Street, disclose earnings
targets, announce large job cuts and buy back up to 15 percent of
its stock all echo Stonecipher's previous stints at Sundstrand and
McDonnell.

US, RUSSIA WORK TO AVERT NUCLEAR WAR BECAUSE OF Y2K BUG

 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Concerned that the year 2000 computer bug might
accidentally set off a nuclear war, the United States and Russia
are hammering out an agreement to station experts in each other's
nuclear command centers next year to prevent miscalculations that
could kill millions of people, according to senior US officials.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is seeking to allay Russian concerns
that a potential breakdown of its computer system caused by the bug
would be misinterpreted by Moscow as an American attack on its
computer defense network. Russian military doctrine anticipates
that a nuclear strike against Moscow would be preceded by an attack
on its military information systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all the radar screens go blank, will they think we did it
and decide to launch a nuclear strike?'' asked Senator Robert F.
Bennett, a Utah Republican who heads the congressional task force
that deals with year 2000 problems.
</P>
<P>
   US military officials met with their Russian counterparts in New
York Friday to reach an agreement. William Curtis, the director of
the Pentagon's year 2000 compliance office, said in an interview
Friday that America would probably have its experts in place in
Moscow by the middle of 1999. He added that the United States is
also in discussions with China, which expressed concerns like those
of the Russians.

humanitarian emergency response operations abroad. Curtis said the

 SEATTLE: and McDonnell.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (The company's new candor, of course, has contributed to its
problems, as promises and predictions have failed to materialize.
But Condit says he still thinks that Boeing should keep lines of
communication open with investors.)
</P>
<P>
   Stonecipher is also seen on Wall Street as a strong executive
who holds his charges accountable, while Condit is widely viewed as
a talented engineer who is out of his element running the country's
11th-largest industrial company.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview on Wednesday, Condit and Stonecipher dismissed
talk about differences between them as idle gossip. Condit said
that they leaned on each other and often swapped roles, but that
Stonecipher's job was to focus more on day-to-day operations while
he concentrated on longer-term strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Few people privy to the inner workings of Boeing's executive
suite would comment on relations between the men. Current and
former Boeing executives are reluctant to criticize them.
</P>
<P>
   The two men could not be more different. Stonecipher is
tough-talking, quick-tempered and unsentimental. He was raised
modestly in the coal-mining regions of eastern Tennessee and worked
his way up through General Electric for 27 years, rising to become
head of its jet engine business before spending seven years at
Sundstrand and three at McDonnell Douglas. He has been married to
his Tennessee sweetheart for more than 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Condit grew up comfortably as an only child in San Francisco,
where his father was a chemist for Standard Oil. He joined Boeing
in 1965 after getting a master's degree in aeronautical engineering
from Princeton and was quickly identified as a golden boy destined
for greater things within the company.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to doing engineering work on a variety of airplanes,
Condit had stints in sales and marketing. He was named president of
Boeing in 1992, rising to chief executive in 1996 and to chairman
last year. He is currently going through his third divorce.
</P>
<P>
   While Stonecipher is feared, Condit, who is known for his people
skills, is genuinely liked. ``I'm a little more aggressive than
Phil,'' Stonecipher told a group of potential investors in New York
last year. ``I'm more likely to shoot you and then ask you your
name. Phil is likely to ask you your name and then shoot you.''
</P>
<P>
   Condit's crowning moment was in the early 1990s, when he led the
team that designed the 777, Boeing's newest and most modern
jetliner. In the course of that project, he promoted an
uncharacteristic degree of teamwork that he has since tried to
spread to the entire company.
</P>
<P>
   A self-described lifelong learner, Condit received his PhD last
year from the Science University of Tokyo. He is also not afraid to
help Boeing executives _ not the most introspective group _ get in
touch with their feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, he hired David J. Whyte, a poet and motivational
speaker, to run workshops with top managers. In one meeting at
Condit's home, the executives were asked to write down negative
stories about Boeing and toss them into a bonfire so that only
positive, inspirational stories would remain.
</P>
<P>
   These days, executives would likely be tossing Boeing's last
five quarterly earnings reports into the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   The company's difficulties building commercial jets have
prevented it from capitalizing on one of the biggest sales booms
ever. Though Boeing has only one competitor left _ Airbus
Industrie, the European consortium _ and is building more jets than
ever, it says it will make hardly any money for the next two years
from selling them. Analysts say that by the time Boeing fixes its
problems, demand will have dried up.
</P>
<P>
   In acquiring McDonnell Douglas, Condit wanted his rival's large
military operations. Along with the space business of Rockwell
International, which Boeing bought for $3.2 billion in 1996, they
were supposed to help Boeing balance the ups and downs of the
notoriously cyclical passenger airplane market. But even with all
those new businesses, Boeing expects to earn only $1 billion this
year, a meager 1.8 percent return on sales.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, it seems obvious that Boeing's commercial airplane
business was headed for trouble, given what the company was trying
to do. Two years ago, when demand for new planes began to pick up
after a drought in the mid-90s, Boeing made a bold bid to gain
market share by offering steep discounts.
</P>
<P>
   Executives believed that plans to overhaul Boeing's production
systems _ which date to World War II and are still largely
paper-based _ would allow the company to lower the unit cost of
each jet by 25 percent, so that it would make a profit even at the
low prices.
</P>
<P>
   As orders poured in, Boeing was forced to increase production to
40 planes a month, from 18, in a year and a half. Rather than help,
the efforts to consolidate 400 separate computer systems, track
millions of parts and digitize thousands of drawings added to the
rising confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Parts shortages developed, and work fell behind schedule as
thousands of new workers _ hired to replace older, skilled laborers
who took early retirement during the previous down cycle _ could
not handle the load.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Boeing was trying to introduce several new
models, each of which required certification by regulators in
Washington and Europe, adding to the delays. In addition, many of
its new orders were from new customers, which meant tens of
thousands of hours of engineering work to customize the planes to
their specifications.
</P>
<P>
   By early October last year, Boeing's assembly lines around
Seattle had seized up. The company said it would halt production of
its 747 and 737 jets for a month to catch its breath. Along with
costly changes on the new 737, that resulted in a stunning $2.6
billion in accounting charges.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were angry; Boeing had been insisting for months that
reports of production difficulties were exaggerated. Over the next
year, as the airplane division struggled to recover, a pattern
developed. Executives led by Condit would try to put the best face
on the situation. But just when it seemed things were turning
around, the company would drop another bombshell.

 SEATTLE: another bombshell.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A low point came in July, when Boeing released its
second-quarter earnings and, for the first time, offered earnings
guidance to Wall Street analysts. While most analysts were
estimating that Boeing would earn $1.64 a share this year and $3.24
a share in 1999 _ down from as high as $5 before the production
difficulties arose _ Condit said the company expected to make $1.01
a share in 1998 and $2.02 a share in '99.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's share price plunged, and analysts were irate. The next
day, when Condit met in Boston with institutional investors and
analysts, one analyst all but called him a liar. At a similar
session in New York the next day, another analyst implied that
Condit was deliberately trying to drive down the price of the stock
to buy it on the cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Shaken, Condit, returned to Seattle and told colleagues he never
wanted to be put in such a position again.
</P>
<P>
   But his credibility has continued to deteriorate. In the spring,
Condit strongly defended Ronald B. Woodard, the head of the
commercial airplane division, when many people were calling for his
head.
</P>
<P>
   Five months later, he ousted Woodard, who had been in line to
become Boeing's president. Insiders now say that Condit's mistake
was not firing Woodard sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd E. Givan, Boeing's chief financial officer for 32 years,
was also forced to resign after reportedly clashing with
Stonecipher. ``I thought they shot the messenger,'' said Dean
Thornton, a retired Boeing executive. Givan will be replaced by
Deborah C. Hopkins, former chief financial officer for General
Motors Europe, who starts work Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Condit said that if he finds fault with himself, it is in
underestimating the challenge of transforming Boeing from a company
of the Cold War era, which valued engineering performance above
all, to one that also values financial performance.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, ``we have unhooked ourselves from market share
intentionally and said what we are about is running a profitable
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Condit and Stonecipher said that the bad news this month was
unavoidable, because the economic downturn in Asia had forced the
company to cut back its production in 2000 far more than it had
thought.
</P>
<P>
   The explanation is puzzling: For more than a year, the company's
assessment had been much less pessimistic than those of outsiders;
now, when some experts are beginning to say that conditions in Asia
are improving, Boeing is saying the situation is worse than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most of the world is really in denial about what's
going on in Asia,'' Stonecipher said.
</P>
<P>
   What really alarmed investors about Boeing's recent disclosures
was the company's acknowledgment that margins on its commercial
airplanes would be even lower in 2000 than in 1999. Boeing
attributed the deterioration to expectations that it will sell more
of its new models, which command lower margins than older planes.
But the announcement raised analysts' concerns that it will take
Boeing longer than anticipated to make its assembly lines more
efficient.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Alan Mulally, the new head of the commercial airplane
division, has delayed the production modernization program;
instead, the company will try to deliver planes on time and avoid
penalties. ``We are probably the least efficient we have ever been
making airplanes,'' Mulally said in an interview last week.
Thousands of extra workers are on the payroll simply to get planes
out the door, he said.
</P>
<P>
   With this month's layoff warning, many of those people are
fearing for their jobs, even as Boeing depends on them to help it
out of a jam. ``It's a helluva Christmas present to give Boeing
employees,'' said Bill Johnson, president of the machinists union
local that represents 39,000 Boeing workers.
</P>
<P>
   The union, which struck Boeing for 69 days in 1995, is gearing
up for negotiations next August, and it believes it has Boeing over
a barrel. The company wants to introduce a new workweek to cut
overtime and institute co-payments on health insurance. The union
will have none of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to be mean,'' Johnson said. ``We are just
going to make sure we get the things we want. They cannot afford a
strike in September. I see them somewhat on the defensive
already.''
</P>
<P>
   Can Condit ride out the current storm? On paper, the odds look
to be in his favor. Only 4 of the 13 board members, including
Stonecipher, came from McDonnell Douglas. Eight are Boeing
holdovers, presumably with loyalties to Condit, including such
pillars of the Northwest as George Weyerhaeuser, the paper magnate,
and Charles M. Pigott, the former chairman of a truck maker, Paccar
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Stonecipher in the executive suite, there is no clear
succession plan. He would be popular with investors, but faces
mandatory retirement in less than three years. The only other
obvious candidate within Boeing is Mulally, 53, who has his hands
full turning around the jet business and is not yet considered
seasoned enough to be chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing a new leader into Boeing from outside would be a
dramatic step for the proud company. But it could hasten changes
that Condit and his predecessors have talked about implementing for
the last decade, with little apparent progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boards really aren't very compassionate,'' Stonecipher said.
``The moment the board decides that somebody else can get this
thing done for them, we will be out of here the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Boeing at that point today? Stonecipher did not hesitate to
answer. ``No,'' he replied.

   In church on Sunday morning, a young boy suddenly announced to
his mother, `Mom, I've decided I'm going to be a minister when I
grow up.`
</P>
<P>
   `That's okay with us,` the mother said, `But what made you
decide to be a minister?`
</P>
<P>
   `Well,` the boy replied, `I'll have to go to church on Sunday
anyway, and I figure it will be more fun to stand up and yell than
to sit still and listen.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Said to be a true story about Neil Armstrong, although I doubt
it &LR;
</P>
<P>
   When Apollo Mission Astronaut Neil Armstrong first walked on the
moon, he not only gave his famous `One small step for man, one
giant leap for mankind` statement but followed it by several
remarks, usual com traffic between him, the other astronauts and
Mission Control. Just before he reentered the ladder, however, he
made the enigmatic remark `Good luck, Mr. Gorsky.`
</P>
<P>
   Many people at NASA thought it was a casual remark concerning
some rival Soviet Cosmonaut. However, upon checking, there was no
Gorsky in either the Russian or American Space Programs.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years many people questioned Armstrong as to what the
`Good luck Mr. Gorsky` statement meant, but Armstrong always
smiled. Just a few years ago, (on July 5, 1995 in Tampa Bay, FL)
while answering questions following a speech, a reporter brought up
the 26 year old question to Armstrong. This time he finally
responded.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Gorsky had finally died and so Neil Armstrong felt he could
answer the question. When he was a kid, he was playing baseball
with a friend in the backyard. His friend hit a ball, which landed
in the front of his neighbor's bedroom windows. His neighbor's were
Mr. and Mrs. Gorsky. As he leaned down to pick up the ball, young
Armstrong heard Mrs. Gorsky shouting at Mr. Gorsky. `Oral sex! You
want oral sex?! You'll get oral sex when the kid next door walks on
the moon!`

GRISLY MURDER NEAR YALE CAMPUS MAKES MANY WARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. _ Michael Doran, a strapping, seemingly
fearless freshman at Yale University, once felt safe walking at
night along the narrow, oak-shrouded streets near the campus in the
heart of this economically rebounding but still troubled city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to think that maybe people were just exaggerating about
the crime in New Haven,'' said Doran, who stands 6 feet 5 inches
tall and hails from Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I guess it's true about everything they said,'' he added,
mulling over the death, one week ago, of Suzanne Jovin, 21, a
senior from Germany, in the mostly middle-class East Rock
neighborhood, not far from the university.
</P>
<P>
   Doran, 18, said he had even begun to ``start looking over my
shoulder'' when walking around town. ``It makes you realize you're
not hidden within the walls of the ivory tower,'' he said. ``You're
in the real world.''
</P>
<P>
   The murder of Ms. Jovin, a well-liked political student best
known, perhaps, for her volunteer work with the mentally retarded,
has stunned Yale and New Haven. The violent death _ Ms. Jovin was
found lying on a East Rock street with her throat slashed _ has
been all the more disturbing to students because no arrests have
been made.
</P>
<P>
   Annie Eure, 19, of Roanoke, Va., a resident of Saybrook College,
one of Yale's 12 undergraduate dormitories, said she used to run in
the East Rock neighborhood. Now, she said, ``I've started working
out at the gym.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Derbyshire, 19, a sophomore from Brentwood, N.Y., added,
``I have the pepper spray with me, but still I'm constantly looking
around, making sure nobody suspicious is following me.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the murder, some students were on guard. In October,
shots were fired in the middle of the afternoon at an intersection
on the edge of campus. No one was injured, but no one has been
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the Yale students looking over their shoulders are
gazing off campus, though. There were news reports that a Yale
teacher was being questioned in Ms. Jovin's killing.
</P>
<P>
   The slaying came in the wake of the arrest last month of Antonio
Lasaga, a geology and geophysics professor and master of Saybrook
College, who faces federal charges of possession of child
pornography. Lasaga was arrested again on Wednesday, accused of
violating a condition of his release by allegedly being near the
home of a minor involved in the case, according to the office of
the U.S. attorney in New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   Although she thinks the Lasaga case and the murder are just ``an
uncanny coincidence,'' Ms. Derbyshire said, ``I'm getting calls
from family members from other states saying, `What's going on?'''
</P>
<P>
   But even though the police said again Friday that they have no
suspects in Ms. Jovin's killing and that Lasaga has not been
convicted, some students here, among the brightest in the nation,
seem to be rushing to judgment and believing the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm starting to think, `Wow, what's the criteria for getting
on the faculty here?''' said Eric Lee, a sophomore from Los
Angeles. ``I mean, I understand you don't want to run a
police-record check on everyone, but ...''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 20, said he was not much more worried about his safety
after Ms. Jovin's murder, but his girlfriend was concerned. ``Now,
I walk with her just about wherever she goes,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I'm wondering how it's going to affect people applying here,''
he added. Applicants, he said, might be reluctant to attend Yale
after hearing of the speculation that a professor was involved in
the slaying and the child-pornography arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Yale officials said the death of Ms. Jovin and the arrest of
Lasaga have had no discernible impact on admission applications,
interview appointments or visits to the campus by prospective
students and their parents.
</P>
<P>
   The killing of Ms. Jovin was the first slaying of a Yale student
since 1991, when Christian Prince, a sophomore from Chevy Chase,
Md., was shot to death by a nonstudent at the base of the steps of
St. Mary's Church on the Yale campus.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Conroy, deputy director of public affairs for the
university, corrected reports that after Prince's death,
applications to Yale were down 9.5 percent for the 1991-92 school
year. ``That is false,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jovin's death comes as New Haven is enjoying something of a
long-awaited renaissance. Although hers was the 14th murder in the
city this year, there were 22 murders last year in New Haven, and
city officials have said that serious crime has been declining
since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers, though, are little solace to students still shaking
over a colleague's killing. ``At first, I thought it was a freak
accident,'' said Jennifer Bayot, 18, a freshman, from Jersey City.
``We were trying to rationalize it _ well, she must have been out
late at night, she must have been really far off campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then we found out she wasn't that far off from where I
work,'' said Ms. Bayot, who works at a community-service center for
girls a few blocks from where Ms. Jovin's body was found.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice neighborhood,'' she said. ``At least that's what I
thought.''

NBA AND UNION TO NEGOTIATE IN PRIVATE AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a late attempt to salvage what is left of the
National Basketball Association season, commissioner David Stern
and Billy Hunter, the executive director of the players union, will
meet face to face Saturday. It will be the second time in three
days that the principal negotiators in the league's labor dispute
have convened in a private setting.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, internal bargaining teams met privately for five hours
in New York. Friday, neither league official nor union officials
were commenting on the negotiations. But a person familiar with the
talks said that although little progress was achieved in the
meeting, the fact that they were meeting at all represented a
positive development.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's premature to say what's going to happen, other than the
parties are trying to explore some possibilities,'' said the person
with knowledge of the negotiations, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``It's overly optimistic to say there's momentum, but it
is certainly much better than the time we weren't meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether progress was made that could lead to an end to the
164-day lockout and a belated start to the season was unclear, but
both parties have apparently agreed to stop the public posturing
and make their bargaining sessions private.
</P>
<P>
   NBA deputy commissioner Russ Granik said the two sides had
pledged secrecy behind closed doors. Several regular participants
in the discussions on both sides were not informed of Thursday's
meeting until after the two sides adjourned.
</P>
<P>
   The approach represents a definite shift away from the public
settings in which the two sides have met with each other and then
met with the news media after each session.
</P>
<P>
   Any hope emerging from the previous talks disintegrated within
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public nature of these discussions has been a detriment to
a solution so far,'' said Leigh Steinberg, an agent who represents
six NBA players and several of the National Football League's
marquee quarterbacks. ``Any good negotiator knows that a quiet and
relaxed setting, with no time restraints and outside pressure, is
much more likely to produce a positive result. This current
climate, where each meeting is followed by the press and all the
parties comment when they walk out of the room, doesn't advance the
cause of the settlement. I think what they're doing now is more
helpful to the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's meeting between Stern and Hunter may also include
chief outside counsels from both sides; Granik, and the union
president, Patrick Ewing _ all of whom met privately Thursday
afternoon. If detailed discussions over proposals strike a chord of
optimism, full bargaining teams will most likely meet in New York
next week.
</P>
<P>
   With seven more games wiped out Friday night, the league has
lost a total of 271 games. With an expected three to four weeks
needed to sign free agents and draft picks as well as a training
camp, another 200 games may be scrapped even after an agreement is
reached.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's meeting was the first contact between the league and
the union since Dec. 3, when a 10{-hour session provided more
pessimism than encouragement for the season to be saved.
</P>
<P>
   That meeting was the first one since Nov. 20, when both sides
reported progress following a lengthy session. The owners have
rejected three requests from the union to have the talks sent to
mediation. With Tuesday's cancellation of the All-Star Game,
scheduled for Feb. 14 in Philadelphia, concern over a lost season
continued to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the sides can reach a resolution in the next few weeks
and prevent the most devastating labor disaster in American sports
history remains to be seen. But, as one league official said: ``At
least we're trying. Maybe this new approach we're taking will make
us understand each other a little better.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg, who said he is behind Hunter and the union, said:
``The tendency in large groups is to have the participants deliver
set speeches, to argue philosophical positions and to speak in the
abstract. And that form of negotiating, where the participants are
extremely anxious to impress their peers or not to embarrass
themselves, is not an ideal negotiating model.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to effective negotiating is to get two parties _ who
are honestly communicating what their goals and priorities are _ to
move into a cooperative paradigm.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Report: Unregulated suburban growth a threat
 &HT;    By Ralph K.M. Haurwitz
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Poorly managed growth in suburban counties
around Austin and other major Texas cities threatens public health,
strains roads, causes drainage problems and erodes the small-town
rural character, according to separate reports by UT researchers
and a state House com- mittee.
</P>
<P>
   The problems involve unincorporated areas, which are outside the
jurisdiction of cities and subject to minimal oversight by
counties. The demand for affordable housing near major cities has
led to rapid development in such areas, with suburban counties
expected to grow more rapidly than other counties during the next
25 years. But poor planning and inadequate regulation have resulted
in leaking septic systems, overloaded country roads and difficult
access for ambulances and other emergency vehicles, which sometimes
must travel five miles on substandard driveways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those growth-related problems will only worsen in many
suburban counties ringing major Texas cities such as Austin,
Dallas, Houston and San Antonio,'' said a draft report prepared for
the Capital Area Planning Council, one of 24 regional planning
commissions in the state, by the UT researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The other report, by the House Land and Resource Management
Committee, said unregulated subdividing was initially thought to be
a problem mainly in Hays and Williamson counties because of the
booming economy of nearby Austin. But it now appears to be
widespread.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many subdivisions have been developed with lots that do not
meet minimum requirements for the installation of a permitted
septic system,'' the committee's report said. ``This creates a
health risk for the purchaser of the lot, as well as others in the
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots were sold with drainage problems and flood with
relatively normal rainfall. The lack of access for emergency
vehicles presents a threat to the safety and lives of those
residents. Ultimately, county citizens are left to pick up the tab
for irrresponsible developers.''
</P>
<P>
   Both reports suggest that legislation is needed before the
problems reach crisis proportions. The vice chairman of the House
panel, Rep. Bob Turner, D-Voss, said Friday that he plans to file a
bill on Monday that would plug a loophole allowing developers to
subdivide land for residential and commercial purposes with
virtually no county oversight. He said such development is a
growing problem in his district, including Bandera County,
northwest of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call them high-dollar colonias,'' Turner said, referring to
the term for substandard develop- ments in the Texas-Mexico border
region. ``There's no regulation, no control.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner said his bill would address a 1995 court decision
involving Elgin Bank and Travis County. Appellate judges ruled that
the bank did not have to file subdivision blueprints and maps,
known as plats, for a tract of land it was subdividing if it was
not building streets or other public areas. The ruling does not
apply in areas subject to a city's jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Many developers, eager to avoid the legal and engineering fees
associated with filing plats, have built without streets by carving
tracts into odd-shaped parcels that resemble a flag atop a pole.
The house or mobile home occupies the flag section, and the pole
section is a driveway leading to an existing public road. Such
subdivisions have numerous closely spaced and parallel driveways
leading to the road.
</P>
<P>
   The flag-lot approach leaves county officials unaware of the
development until bulldozers appear, often too late to ensure
adequate wastewater disposal, drainage, water supply, road
culverts, roads and other essentials.
</P>
<P>
   The UT report, unlike the House committee's report, lists a
variety of more sweeping options, including granting counties
planning and zoning powers in areas of critical concern.
</P>
<P>
   However, even modest efforts to expand counties' regulatory
powers have failed in the past few legislative sessions. There are
nonetheless signs that lawmakers might be more willing in the
upcoming five-month session, which begins Jan. 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``Members of the Legislature are being pushed by our
constituency,'' Turner said. ``I really think the time is right.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ron Lewis, D-Mauriceville, who filed a bill last session,
agreed. ``I think we'll be able to get a consensus between the
builders and the counties,'' he said. ``It won't be everything
everybody wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner said his bill would focus on closing the so-called Elgin
Bank loophole. But a consensus favoring a more sweeping approach is
gradually taking shape among representatives of county, plan- ning
and policy groups, said Betty Voights, executive director of the
Capital Area Planning Council, which sponsored a meeting on the
issue last week.
</P>
<P>
   The emerging consensus is that counties need expanded powers on
what she called ``the big four'' _ water, wastewater, streets and
drainage. Public safety might well be added to the wish list,
Voights said.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Seale, executive director of the Texas Association of
Counties, said he is optimistic. ``Plugging the Elgin Bank loophole
would not be enough,'' he said. ``A well-thought-out plan of
development is something commissioners' courts need to take a look
at.''

 &HT;    Heisman to be payoff for Williams' patience
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After Ricky Williams led the nation in rushing and
scoring last season on a 4-7 team, the Texas running back was
tempted to jump to the NFL and its instant riches. But Williams
passed on pro football to pursue a more fitting conclusion to his
college football career.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had turned pro last year, I would have always felt like
there was something missing,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   He should get that storybook finish tonight at the Downtown
Athletic Club in New York, where he is expected to receive the 1998
Heisman Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who ran for 2,124 yards this season, is a strong
favorite over three quarterbacks: Michael Bishop of Kansas State,
Tim Couch of Kentucky and Cade McNown of UCLA. All will attend the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Williams led the Longhorns to an 8-3 record and a spot in the
Jan. 1 Cotton Bowl against Mississippi State.
</P>
<P>
   He rushed for 6,279 yards in his career, breaking the Division I
record that had been held by Pittsburgh's Tony Dorsett since 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been around a football player that is more
deserving of everything that has come his way,'' Texas coach Mack
Brown said. ``Ricky was the heart and soul of our team. Without him
we wouldn't be 8-3 and wouldn't be in the Cotton Bowl. It has been
my privilege to coach him.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of the regular season, Williams has been on the
banquet circuit. At Thursday night's ESPN Awards show in Orlando,
he received the Doak Walker Award, which goes to the nation's best
running back, and the Maxwell Award, which goes to the nation's
best player.
</P>
<P>
   Williams has already been named Player of the Year by the Walter
Camp Football Foundation. Twenty-six of the previous 31 winners of
the Camp Award have gone on to win the Heisman, including the last
seven straight. He will be a consensus All-American.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to career yardage, Williams holds 14 other NCAA
records, including rushing TDs (72), points (452) and all-purpose
yards (7,206).
</P>
<P>
   The three quarterbacks who will join him tonight had impressive
statistcs, too. Couch completed 400 of 553 passes for 4,275 yards
and 36 touchdowns for Kentucky. Kansas State's Bishop was
164-for-295 for 2,844 yards and 23 TDs, and ran for 748 yards and
14 TDs). UCLA's McNown was 188-for-323 for 3,130 yards and 23 TDs.
</P>
<P>
   But even Couch says Williams deserved the award.
</P>
<P>
   ``As many times as he carries the ball, he's just as strong in
the fourth quarter as he is in the first quarter,'' Couch said.
``He's an amazing player. I'd give him my vote.

 &HT;    S.C. not the place for Holtz
 &HT;    By Terence Moore
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Lou Holtz? At South Carolina? Anyway, that groan you
hear is coming from the vicinity of Knute Rockne's grave.
</P>
<P>
   Either that, or those are the collective sounds of folks who
believe a football coach who leaves Notre Dame for whatever reason
should resemble your average President of the United States after
his final term.
</P>
<P>
   That a former Notre Dame coach should spend the rest of his life
doing absolutely nothing worth mentioning.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to get picky, Jimmy Carter works for Habitat For
Humanity, and William Howard Taft became Chief Justice of the
Supreme Court. So let Lou Holtz build houses across the country or
work in a flowing black robe in the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is, Holtz should do anything he wants these
days, except coach away from the Golden Dome.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't make sense. Actually, it does, and we'll get to
that after we finish telling you about the illogic here.
</P>
<P>
   When Holtz left Notre Dame two seasons ago, he was only six
victories shy of topping Rockne as the Fighting Irish's winningest
coach. Now Holtz is taking over a South Carolina football program
whose closest thing to Rockne has been nobody.
</P>
<P>
   Despite great facilities, spurred by a wonderful fan base that
pumps nearly as much cash into its program as any in the SEC, South
Carolina isn't Notre Dame. South Carolina isn't even Vanderbilt
during many seasons. The Gamecocks have played football for 106
years, and they are three games under .500 overall. This year's
1-10 flop didn't help.
</P>
<P>
   While Notre Dame recruits nationally, South Carolina depends on
leftovers from a state with only a few prized recruits. Worse, the
bulk of those recruits go either to South Carolina's Great Satan
called Clemson or to traditional powers in the SEC or ACC.
</P>
<P>
   So that brings us to a simple question: Why? After all, Holtz
was a growing star in retirement as a football analyst for CBS.
Money definitely wasn't a factor for Holtz, not with the thousands
he receives from corporations for his motivational talks.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, at nearly 62, and with his wife, Beth, recovering from
throat cancer, you'd think that life for Holtz visiting those plush
golf courses around his Orlando home would be just fine.
</P>
<P>
   The answer here is twofold. First, Holtz obviously didn't leave
Notre Dame on his own after 11 seasons of both triumph and turmoil.
Even now, neither Holtz nor Notre Dame officials will discuss his
abrupt resignation from the Irish beyond the superficial.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Holtz showed he wasn't ready to leave South Bend by
coming to Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   As for the biggest reason for Holtz's return to coaching, we'll
just say that he is suffering from the addiction that often
overcomes athletes, and so is John Robinson. This is the same John
Robinson who was a two-time coach at Southern Cal and once ran the
Los Angeles Rams. He just left retirement to take over the Las
Vegas football program.
</P>
<P>
   Don't ask. This addiction for Holtz and Robinson is to
adrenaline. Just as athletes have to play, coaches have to coach _
even if it means doing the unthinkable of going from Notre Dame to
South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   No, going from Notre Dame to anywhere.

 &HT;    Walker hints politics, not broadcasting, in his future
 &HT;    By Prentis Rogers
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The last time Herschel Walker saw a Georgia high
school playoff game in person, he was wearing a Johnson County
uniform en route to a state record 3,167 yards rushing and the
Class A championship.
</P>
<P>
   When told that was 19 years ago, he flashed a look of surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't seem like that long. It seems like it was
yesterday,'' said Walker, whose face has not aged since he was the
most sought-after high school football player in America. ``I guess
I've been really blessed.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker, who lives in Dallas, was back in his home state to serve
as the color commentator on GPTV's coverage of the Class AAA
semifinals at the Georgia Dome. Though Friday's Cairo-Dougherty
game was his first television assignment in the booth, he has
dabbled in the medium.
</P>
<P>
   During his stint with the Minnesota Vikings, Walker said he
produced a television show, and there have been a few instances
when he has ``done some college stuff down on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   However, broadcasting is not on his list of possibilities for
life after football.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something I'm thinking about doing. I don't watch
enough football to do color,'' Walker said. ``But I'm excited about
coming here to do this. I've been doing a lot with kids in Texas,
California and Minnesota, but I haven't done a lot here in Georgia.
I'd like to start to doing more things in Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   It was about four hours before air time, and Walker was relaxing
in the lobby of his hotel. His 6-foot, 220-pound frame showed no
signs of wear and tear after gaining 17,001 all-purpose yards,
fourth highest in NFL history. At 37, Georgia's 1982 Heisman Trophy
winner still looks fit enough to play in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a couple of guaranteed contracts, but I will only play
for a team with a good chance to get to the Super Bowl,'' Walker
said. ``I don't have to play for the money.''
</P>
<P>
   So Walker has spent the season meeting with kids around the
country as part of the Health South Road Show and concentrating on
developing a new aloe-based health drink that he says will be in
Wal-Mart stores by the first of February.
</P>
<P>
   Though Walker owns a couple of businesses, the native of
Wrightsville hinted politics may be the next arena he enters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been people wanting me to run for different stuff
in Texas, but I'm from Georgia. If I ever ran for public office,
and I'm not sure if that's something I will do, I wouldn't run in
Texas, I'd run in Georgia,'' Walker said. ``I'm grateful for the
support I've gotten in Minnesota, Philadelphia and Dallas, but I'm
a Georgia product.''
</P>
<P>
   All the more reason GPTV was ecstatic to get one of the most
storied figures in Georgia football to participate in its coverage.
However, that didn't necessarily mean he knew a lot of stories
about football in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Dublin, which is next to my hometown, would be
playing. But Cairo knocked them out,'' Walker said. ``And then I
saw they were the Syrupmakers. Have they always been that, or did
they just come up with that name?''
</P>
<P>
   By the kickoff at 6 p.m., it would be safe to say he knew the
answer.

 &HT;    'We need this win in the worst way'
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Kicker Morten Andersen, who is eighth in NFL history
with 257 games played, has played in more Saints-Falcons games than
any other player, kicking 13 seasons for New Orleans and the past
four for Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   He's been a big factor in several games, as six of his
NFL-record 25 game-winning kicks came against the Falcons when he
played for New Orleans. In his first year with Atlanta, 1995, he
kicked a 21-yarder in overtime to beat the Saints.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen spoke with the Journal-Constitution about this game,
and how it's different from others.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What else makes this game special?
</P>
<P>
   A: We need this win in the worst way. It's our last division
game, and it would give us a big step toward winning the division.
That's huge. This game was by far the one (Saints) fans got up for
the most. Other than the division (implications), though, for me,
there's no real special sentimental reason anymore. There was more
emotion in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The New Orleans front office felt an average salary of
$1million per year was too much for a kicker. Did you take that
personally when they asked you to take a pay cut (in '95), and how
did you end up with the Falcons?
</P>
<P>
   A: The way I look at it now, it's totally water under the
bridge. They kind of surprised me the night before training camp.
There's a misconception. People think I got released, but I asked
for my release. Several teams called right away (Andersen signed a
day later with the Falcons). The idea of staying in the division
and this part of the country was important. (Former Saints and
Falcons quarterback) Bobby (Hebert) was here, (former Saints and
Falcons running back Craig) Ironhead (Heyward) was here. I would
have a chance to play the Saints twice a year. The team was
competitive at that time. We made the playoffs in 1995 ... and my
agent had a good relationship with the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you remember about the Superdome?
</P>
<P>
   A: It gets very, very loud in there. It's so enormous, but you
still get a good, cozy feel in there. I just like the feel in
there. In many ways, it's home.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The fans there can get a little rough, don't you agree?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, not really. They're loyal, and wanted to win in the worst
way. They were great. I would rather have a fan that really shows
the way he feels. They pay for the ticket, they're allowed to boo
and cheer. As long as it doesn't get violent, I'm all for it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Which of your game-winning kicks against the Falcons stands
out most?
</P>
<P>
   A: My second year, (former Saints quarterback) Kenny Stabler
called timeout with about two seconds left at Atlanta-Fulton County
Stadium. I was quite nervous, and as he came off he said, ``Let's
go home, Morten.'' I made the kick (a 35-yarder as time expired for
a 19-17 Saints win), and we went home.

CHARITY'S TIES TO MOBSTER SNARL IT IN INVESTIGATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Everyone knows what not to do with a gift horse. But
who knows how to handle charity from a hood with a heart of gold, a
reputed mob figure who wants to donate $1 million he has raised for
medical research?
</P>
<P>
   If you care about sick people, you do not turn such donors away,
said Allan Weinberg, director of the National Leukemia Research
Association, an organization that has relied for 12 years on the
fund-raising acumen of William Cutolo, a man whom law-enforcement
authorities list as a captain in the Colombo crime family.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only obligation is to say thank you,'' said Weinberg on
Friday as he prepared for his group's annual dinner in Brooklyn on
Saturday night. ``I want a man that can help. I want one thing _ to
raise money and eradicate leukemia.''
</P>
<P>
   But the charity's relationship with Cutolo, who sits on its
board of directors and has been its Man of the Year, has got the
organization entangled in the widening investigation into
corruption in New York City's largest municipal union.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators studying Cutolo's relationship with the union,
District Council 37, have questioned whether contributions he
solicited from labor leaders for leukemia research ever made it to
medical professionals, according to lawyers familiar with the
inquiry. Weinberg insists they did. ``I watch this charity like a
hawk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The charity inquiry represents just one thread of the Manhattan
district attorney's broad investigation into accusations of
kickbacks, embezzlement and voter fraud within the district
council, an umbrella group of 56 locals that represent 120,000 city
workers.
</P>
<P>
   A broader question being pursued by investigators, the lawyers
said, is whether organized-crime figures, including Cutolo, were
able to secure no-show jobs for their friends and a share of
kickbacks from vendors who did business with several blue-collar
locals. Union officials have also told investigators about
incidents in which infighting among organized-crime factions for
control of union spoils led to violence and intimidation against
union leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In one incident several years ago, recounted by several union
officials speaking on the condition that they not be identified,
Frank Morelli, then the district council president, was confronted
in his office by several men who threw furniture, broke a
television set and threatened him.
</P>
<P>
   Morelli is one of four officials of the district council or its
parent union who have been honored as men of the year by the
leukemia association _ largely, Weinberg acknowledges, because
labor honorees are usually able to fill tables and sell
advertisements in the charity's dinner journal.
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg estimates that the charity, which is based in Garden
City, has received as much as $40,000 from the union and its
officials over the years, much of it solicited by Cutolo.
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg said that when he first met Cutolo at a charity dinner
years ago, he did not know of the organized-crime allegations
against him. But by themselves, he said, they were not sufficient
reason to bar him from the charity board. ``I would not put on
someone convicted of a crime,'' he said, ``but accused _ that is
something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors who have either received grants from the charity or
supervise their distribution said that much of the money raised is
spent on medical research. Several said they were stunned both by
the suggestion that there was anything amiss about the charity and
by the idea that their research might be underwritten with the help
of organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be kidding me,'' said Dr. Peter Wiernik, an
oncologist at Our Lady of Mercy Medical Center in the Bronx, who
has helped review the charity's grant proposals for 20 years. ``All
I can say is that I'm given a budget for research proposals. They
are reviewed in a standard peer review process, and when we make
recommendations, they are funded.''
</P>
<P>
   The charity's federal income-tax returns show it has raised a
little more than $1 million over the last three years. About
$400,000 has gone to finance direct grants to doctors or to
individuals with leukemia. As is the case with many charities, the
rest of the money is listed as having been spent on support
services for the programs, for fund-raising expenses or for
administrative overhead, like rent, insurance and salaries.
</P>
<P>
   The group maintains that 88 percent of its 1997 expenditures
were directly related to its programs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One grant recipient, Dr. Faith Marie Young, a Harvard Medical
School graduate who received $20,000 in 1996 for research with
genetically engineered mice, said the charity seemed legitimate.
``The work they are doing is important,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cutolo is far from the first reputed organized-crime figure to
become publicly involved with a charity. ``A lot of mob guys want
to be legitimate,'' said Bruce Mouw, a retired supervisor with the
FBI who specialized in tracking organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   But as Mouw noted, Cutolo's claim to fame has hardly been
philanthropy. Within mob circles, Mouw said, Cutolo is better known
for having been a major player in the violent internal war within
the Colombo family. ``His crew was very active trying to kill the
Persico side and was responsible for several murders,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cutolo was charged with murder and racketeering as a result, but
was acquitted in 1994 after a federal trial. He has never been
convicted of a crime, although in 1990 he was expelled from the
Teamsters union, in which he headed a local, because of his
reported connections to organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   Cutolo's lawyer, James LaRossa, denied that his client had a
role in any wrongdoing, and described as ``ridiculous'' the
suggestion that his client had any improper role in influencing
actions within the district council or the charity.
</P>
<P>
   Cutolo is expected Saturday night at the charity's annual
dinner, which will be held at the Embassy Terrace, a catering hall
where he was the host of his son's wedding reception three years
ago. Weinberg said the charity was expecting about 300 people to
attend the $200-a-head dinner.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, he said, he has not seen any checks from officials
at District Council 37. ``I don't think they are showing up this
year,'' he said.

EDITORIAL: SCHOOLS SHOULD NOT BE POKER CHIPS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y.)   (js) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Dec. 12:
</P>
<P>
   Albany's recent back-room negotiations about the New York state
Legislature's desire for a pay raise and Gov. George Pataki's list
of quid pro quos would normally be dismissed as another episode of
the state's dysfunctional lawmaking. But these talks shoved his
plan for charter schools to the fore. As it turns out, his bill is
not so much a well-thought-out blueprint for innovation in public
education as it is a catalog of problematic proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Under the governor's plan, for instance, taxpayer-financed
charter schools would be ``encouraged'' to admit pupils ``at risk
of academic failure'' but could ``refer a student with
disabilities'' to the regular school district for evaluation and
placement. This might be an orderly process, or it could be misused
as a license to dump the hard to educate in regular public schools.
Charter schools could also issue bonds. But the bill does not spell
out who pays bondholders if the school defaults. The lenders,
Pataki aides say, would assume the risk.
</P>
<P>
   Sound legislation can only emerge from public hearings with open
debate, not the secret bargaining to which governors and
legislative leaders have long been addicted. Evidence of the need
for hearings comes from the governor's Republican allies in the
Senate. Disturbed by the Pataki plan, they passed a bill containing
major revisions to still the fears of favored supplicants.
</P>
<P>
   Under one provision backed by Joseph Bruno, the Senate majority
leader, no more than five teachers on a charter-school faculty
could be instructors who are not state-certified. The Pataki bill
has no such limit. Another clause placates 300 rural school
districts in which the 1997-1998 enrollment was ``less than 1,500
pupils.'' It permits school boards of these districts to vote to
ban charter schools. This is a haphazard way to decide eligibility
for insulation.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 states have charter school laws. Expanding New
York's range of experimental offerings is fine, provided that it is
fair to charter schools and to struggling public schools, which
will continue to educate most children.
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, the experience of California, home to more than
100 charter schools since 1992, is sobering. A new study of
California's charter schools by researchers at the University of
California at Los Angeles found a large gap between promise and
performance. It found no evidence to support the mantra that most
of these schools do more with less. Often, it found, the
community's wealth and ``well-connected leaders'' determine whether
a school has sufficient funds. When the nearby public schools were
overcrowded, ``competition'' from a charter school does not force
improvements in traditional schools, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   The interlude between now and New Year's Day is no time for the
governor, Bruno and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver to draft an
important bill. The triumvirate should decouple charter schools
from the pay-raise issue and other one-dimensional fare, and hold
hearings in early 1999.

BRUINS' DEPTH A DIFFERENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ While coach Steve Lavin whittles down his rotation
in preparation for conference play, the Bruins are wearing down
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Against Oklahoma State, eight Bruins played at least 15 minutes
and two others played at least five. The Cowboys used seven players
extensively and were fatigued in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Oklahoma State coach) Eddie Sutton said to me, `You've got
waves of fresh bodies,''' Lavin said. ``That's how our players used
to feel against Duke or Kentucky or Stanford.''
</P>
<P>
   Lavin tweaks his rotation based on matchups, practice
performance, feel, fatigue and fouls. If a player doesn't hustle on
defense, he's pulled. If he takes a bad shot, he's pulled. Fatigue?
Out. Foul trouble? Out.
</P>
<P>
   Count on Baron Davis, Earl Watson, JaRon Rush, Travis Reed, Dan
Gadzuric, Jerome Moiso and Matt Barnes being in the top rotation
once Pac-10 play begins Jan. 2 against Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The second wave _ Rico Hines, Ryan Bailey and Ray Young _ must
impress in practice and contribute in games to warrant extended
time.
</P>
<P>
   The third wave, Brandon Loyd, Sean Farnham and Todd Ramasar,
will fill specific needs.
</P>
<P>
   In all, nine players are averaging at least 17 minutes. Compare
that to recent seasons, when the Bruins had six or seven top
players and a slew of walk-ons.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there is no comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, what a difference,'' Lavin said. ``You don't know what
it's like until you have a team that's 12 deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, when J.R. (Henderson) got in foul trouble (at
Duke), we had Rico on Elton Brand. The difference one year later .
. . it was almost comical at times.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Davis update: Davis played 16 minutes against Delaware State,
his first game back from the knee injury, and 19 against Oklahoma
State. Don't expect him to play more than 20-22 minutes today
against Nevada-Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bulky brace on his left leg, Davis' medical team
doesn't want to exhaust his reconstructed anterior cruciate
ligament.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may stay at 20 minutes for a while,'' Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Stat of the Week: Gadzuric has 10 steals in six games, second
on the team and a surprising figure for a 6-foot-10 center. Why?
Gadzuric has extremely quick feet for his size, the result of years
playing soccer in his native Holland.
</P>
<P>
   Gadzuric does not have UCLA's longest wingspan, however. That
belongs to forward Jerome Moiso.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has alien-like tentacles,'' Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Lineup change?: Rush might rejoin the starting lineup today
after a two-game absence due to back spasms, which limited his
practice availability. Rush's back-strengthening exercises are
slowly reducing the pain and extending his practice time.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 13)  
 (af)  
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The corporate earnings pre-announcement season is opening on a
sour note with bad news from the likes of Merck, Coca-Cola, Boeing,
Newell and Sears, Roebuck, as well as from several utility
companies that have been hurt by the unseasonably warm weather.
</P>
<P>
   The financial crisis in Asia and elsewhere is an aggravating
problem for some, like Boeing. But for others, like Newell, a maker
of consumer products, it may be that the slowdown is finally
emerging in the United States. Newell said last week that sales had
slumped for its Calphalon cookware and Rolodex files.
</P>
<P>
   But investors are going to have trouble sorting out how Wall
Street analysts think fourth-quarter profits will finally shake out
when the earnings announcements are made early next year. As of
now, they can get two distinctly different signals from the most
closely watched firms that collect Wall Street earnings forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   IBES International says that the analysts' earnings forecasts it
compiles for the 500 companies in the Standard &AMP; Poor's index
indicate that overall operating profits will fall 0.5 percent in
the fourth quarter, compared with the period in 1997. With the
decline of 6.2 percent in the third quarter, this would be the
first two-quarter decline in earnings since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   But the First Call Corp. says the analysts it tracks predict
that overall operating earnings will grow by 4.5 percent in the
fourth quarter. That would not be a bad rebound from the 3.1
percent decline that First Call calculated for the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Hill, First Call's research director, expects the final
number to be lower, but still around 4 percent. (Coke's own
earnings downgrading Friday is in the IBES number and will lower
First Call's this week.)
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the gap is that some of the analysts are
different. First Call, for example, does not use earnings estimates
from analysts at Standard &AMP; Poor's. The policies at each firm are
different for updating forecasts when analysts change their
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But the main difference seems to be how each firm compares the
current quarter with the previous one.
</P>
<P>
   IBES compares the earnings estimates for the 500 companies now
in the S&AMP;P to the earnings for the 500 companies that were in the
index a year earlier. First Call adjusts the year-earlier S&AMP;P 500
to reflect the makeup of the current index.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 43 changes in the S&AMP;P 500 index this year.
Chrysler is gone. BankAmerica and Nationsbank merged and Union
Planters was added. MCI and Worldcom merged and RJR Nabisco was
added.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a record number of changes because of mergers,''
said David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&AMP;P. ``The
fact that they are dealing with a different composition would make
a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, all these reasons do not explain fully the gap
between the estimates, and it might take a lot of computer time _
and cooperation between the two firms _ to find an explanation. But
there is little doubt that the divergence is not helping the
credibility of the data.
</P>
<P>
   ``It worries me that we are three percentage points off in the
third quarter and almost five percentage points off in the fourth
quarter,'' Hill said. ``I wouldn't have a clue of where we could be
doing something wrong on this.''
</P>
<P>
   What do investors do? First Call is comparing apples to apples,
and that is probably better. But all investors should remember that
there is a bigger problem with the analysts who make the forecasts
that the two companies compile. Year in and year out, they are
virtually always too optimistic and spend most of their time
scaling back earlier predictions.
</P>
<P>
   This means that both the IBES and First Call earnings forecasts
for the first and second quarters of 1999 are likely to be revised
downward. That is even a surer bet than usual given the new signs
of a slowing American economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve's current regional economic survey showed
that retail sales were weaker than expected, manufacturing was
``generally softer'' and growth slowed in five regions.
</P>
<P>
   And American exports dropped $1.2 billion in the third quarter,
reflecting the disappearance of demand from the rest of the world
as Asian and developing economies slow down or sink into
recessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``My boss asked me what will happen to the earnings forecasts in
the first and second quarter,'' said Joseph Abbott, United States
research manager at IBES. ``I told him I was sure they were going
to go down. But I don't know how much.''

EDITORIAL: CITIZEN ACTIVISTS ON HUMAN RIGHTS  
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Dec. 12:
</P>
<P>
   Fifty years ago this week, the United Nations adopted the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Genocide Convention.
The world of 1948, impressed by the Nuremberg Tribunals, seemed
ready to enforce international laws to prevent new acts of genocide
and crimes against humanity. But nothing happened _ until 1993,
when the international tribunal for Bosnia became the first of
several new attempts to enforce these laws. One important reason
for the change is the participation of citizen-activists, who have
initiated some of the cases and played a major role in shaping the
new courts.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Gen. Augusto Pinochet of Chile began with
private citizens. An organization of Spanish lawyers filed a
complaint accusing him of human rights abuses. The laws of Spain
and many other nations allow judges to investigate complaints from
the public and open a case if the evidence warrants. The 1994
French conviction of Paul Touvier for crimes against humanity in
Nazi-occupied France also began as a complaint by the son of a
victim, and the work of Nazi-hunters such as Beate Klarsfeld was
instrumental in the 1987 conviction of Klaus Barbie. The only cases
in U.S. courts against foreign human rights violators are suits
brought by private citizens against figures such as the Bosnian
Serb leader Radovan Karadzic.
</P>
<P>
   Activists outside government have also influenced the new
international courts. The international criminal court would not
have been endorsed last summer by 120 nations without the work of
human rights groups, which mobilized citizens, lobbied leaders and
wrote and analyzed drafts of the court's statutes. Governments have
been more receptive to their arguments since the end of the Cold
War, which had provided many of the world's worst criminals with
political patrons. Leaders were also more willing to act because
they failed to prevent genocide in Bosnia and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   The new court can aggressively prosecute rape and sexual
enslavement, as the Bosnia and Rwanda tribunals have. This is
largely due to international women's groups, which lobbied the
governments writing the courts' statutes and raised prosecutors'
awareness of the issue. Outside pressure was unable to persuade
Washington to join the court. Private citizens cannot push leaders
where they refuse to go. But they have breathed life into the
documents their governments signed 50 years ago.

COMMITTEE PASSES 3 IMPEACHMENT COUNTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER AND ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Spurning President Clinton's dramatic, last-minute
appeal, the House Judiciary Committee Friday approved the first
impeachment charges against a president since the national upheaval
of the Watergate crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-controlled committee, riven by extraordinary
partisan rancor, recommended removing Clinton from office for two
counts of perjury and one count of obstructing justice for
allegedly engaging in an elaborate effort to conceal his sexual
affair in the White House with a former intern, Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Despite broad public opposition to Clinton's ouster, the somber
committee began casting the historic votes just minutes after the
beleaguered president issued his most contrite apology to date and
said for the first time that he would accept a lesser sanction than
impeachment, such as a censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want the American people to know, what I want the
Congress to know is that I am profoundly sorry for all I have done
wrong in words and deeds,'' Clinton said. ``I never should have
misled the country, the Congress, my friends or my family. Quite
simply, I gave in to my shame.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoing Representative Barney Frank, a Newton Democrat, who had
argued the night before for censure rather than impeachment
charges, the president said, ``I would give anything to go back and
undo what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Unswayed, the Judiciary Committee voted along party lines,
21-16, to charge Clinton with perjuring himself before a federal
grand jury investigating the Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Article 1 is approved,'' said the chairman, Representative
Henry J. Hyde, at 4:25 p.m., amid the first presidential
impeachment case in a generation and the third in history.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican, Representative Lindsey O. Graham of South
Carolina, broke with the GOP majority, as the committee voted,
20-17, several hours later to approve the second perjury charge:
that Clinton lied under oath in a civil deposition in the sexual
harassment case that Paula Corbin Jones filed against him and
settled last month for $850,000.
</P>
<P>
   The obstruction of justice charge was adopted shortly after 9
p.m., again along strictly partisan lines: 21-16.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the committee is expected to approve a fourth
charge, that Clinton abused his office, and send the impeachment
matter to the full House for a showdown next week _ where the
outcome is too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Clinton's last-ditch appeal, committee Republicans said
he deserves the shame of being removed from office because he has
never been forthright about his lies under oath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the only way we will ever reconcile Bill
Clinton with the law is for us to have the moral courage to find
him guilty of these crimes,'' Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   Within and beyond the same stately hearing room where the
Judiciary Committee passed articles of impeachment against
President Richard M. Nixon in 1974, Democrats on the panel
portrayed the charges against Clinton as the product of a partisan
vendetta aimed at reversing the president's election in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fear for the country,'' Representative William D. Delahunt
of Quincy said in an interview. ``This is the beginning of a de
facto movement toward a parliamentary form of government that will
poison relationships within the institution and divide people in
the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Representative Martin T. Meehan, a Lowell
Democrat, emerged sullenly from the hearing room. ``I feel sick at
heart about what this means for the Congress, the country, and the
presidency,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After the final impeachment vote today, the committee is
expected to reject a Democratic alternative that would censure
Clinton for ``reprehensible conduct.'' The measure would require
Clinton to sign a resolution acknowledging ``he violated the trust
of the American people, lessened their esteem for the office of
president, and dishonored the office which they have entrusted to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who faces the increasing likelihood that the House will
send at least one impeachment charge to the Senate for the first
trial of a president in 130 years, broke his recent silence on the
matter in the final minutes before the Judiciary Committee passed
the first perjury count against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must also be at peace with the fact that the public
consequences of my actions are in the hands of the American people
and their representatives in the Congress,'' Clinton said. ``Should
they determine that my errors of word and deed require their rebuke
and censure, I am ready to accept that.''
</P>
<P>
   White House aides argued strenuously with Clinton Thursday night
over what he should say in the high-stakes speech and when he
should give it.
</P>
<P>
   Some aides believed Clinton had more to gain by waiting until
after the committee voted and the president returned from a
four-day trip to the Middle East, which begins today. Others argued
that Clinton needed to make a forceful statement aimed at about two
dozen undecided lawmakers before leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton broke up the meeting, saying he would think about it
overnight. But then a draft of one of the president's proposed
statements appeared later that night on MSNBC. In it, the president
would call his conduct ``terribly wrong'' and conclude that he may
have ``crossed the line'' in his hairsplitting testimony under
oath.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton blew up over the leak, and White House aides said they
were in the dark about whether Clinton would make a statement until
less than a hour before he delivered it.
</P>
<P>
   The undecided lawmakers are expected to decide Clinton's fate
when the matter is taken up by the full House, probably on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the timing of his remarks, Clinton was given no hope of
persuading committee Republicans to abandon their inexorable push
toward passing impeachment charges. And no member of the GOP
majority on the panel was swayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in his most recent apology, the president continues to
deny the serious criminal acts of perjury, obstruction of justice,
and witness tampering he has committed and to rely upon technical
legal arguments advanced by his attorneys,'' Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Representative Bob Barr of Georgia, saw it, Clinton
``continues to thumb his nose at the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans were no less strident within the towering
hearing room, as they sparred with defiant Democrats for more than
nine hours over the three impeachment charges.
</P>
<P>
   The count of grand-jury perjury, which committee members in both
parties said is the most likely charge to pass the House, came
under relentless fire from committee Democrats who complained that
the impeachment resolution does not lay out which of Clinton's
statements allegedly constitute perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Frank said Republicans cloaked the allegation in ``deliberate
vagueness and obfuscation'' because they feared the statements
might not be impeachable and because they were wary of a backlash
if they highlighted the salacious nature of the testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The statements relate to intimate details of Clinton's sexual
relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority knows a losing case when they see one,'' Frank
said. ``They look at Kenneth Starr's three charges, and they say,
`Whoa, we can't defend these,' so they obfuscate and dress them
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Committee Republicans countered that Clinton's allies on the
committee were trying to include the precise statements in the
impeachment resolution so the charges could not be expanded if the
case goes to trial in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very clever ruse to try to limit the evidence,'' said
Representative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., a Wisconsin Republican.
</P>
<P>
   As for the perjury charge involving Clinton's deposition in the
Jones case, Graham was the only Republican who agreed with
Democrats that the allegation was not impeachable because a judge
had ruled Lewinsky was not a material witness in the case. Graham
also said he felt uncomfortable about recommending Clinton's
impeachment on the charge because he agreed with the president's
lawyers that Jones's lawyers appeared to ambush him about his
relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The obstruction of justice charge cites seven instances when
Clinton attempted to ``delay, impede, cover up and conceal''
evidence in the Jones case, particularly in seeking to prevent
discovery of some of the 64 gifts that he and Lewinsky exchanged.
The charge also relates to Clinton's alleged role in helping
Lewinsky find a job in New York at a time when she was developing a
false affidavit to submit in the Jones case that denied her sexual
relationship with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   During the committee's debate, the White House and the House
minority leader, Richard A. Gephardt, were gearing up for the House
vote next week, hoping to win commitments for a vote on censure.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt was calling Democrats to try to hold the line on
defections and find a way to bring a censure vote to the floor,
said Laura Nichols, his press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Clinton's chief of staff, John Podesta,
reached out to House Speaker-elect Robert L. Livingston for a
censure vote. ``If we were denied that choice, I think it would say
something about the fairness of the process,'' said White House
press secretary Joseph Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston remains publicly uncommitted on whether to allow a
censure vote. But the majority whip, Representative Tom DeLay of
Texas, who is in charge of organizing the House impeachment agenda,
adamantly opposes a vote on censure.

 A Slurpee, Some Jerky, And a Burgundy, Please _ 7-Eleven stores  go
upscale   By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
7-Eleven, the world's largest convenience store chain, is going
upscale. Southland Corp. of Dallas is now pushing premium wines
along with self-serve coffee and the Slurpee at about 3,200 of its
5,600 North American outlets.
</P>
<P>
   New international wine displays carrying 30 different varieties
have been installed recently by the front door of many of
7-Eleven's 1,000 stores in California.
</P>
<P>
   Like other retailers, 7-Eleven has experienced growing consumer
demand for upscale beverages like imported beer and gourmet
coffees. It also is well aware that supermarket wine sales grew 43
percent since 1994, making it the fastest-growing beverage category
after soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
   7-Eleven's expanded selection includes some of the best-selling
brands such as Beringer, Bolla, Gallo, Fetzer, Kendall-Jackson,
Korbel and Woodbridge. In addition to $5.99-to-$14.99 price tags (a
bit more than some big stores), they carry the flag of the country
of origin and flowery descriptions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, 7-Eleven advises its customers that Andre Sparkling
Wine has ``apple &AMP; pear flavors,'' Beringer Chardonnay has
``buttery flavors, a hint of oak,'' and Gabbiano Chianti is ``rich,
soft &AMP; spicy.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The displays include pictograms of suitable food pairings
(like beef or fish) but they don't suggest which wines go best with
7-Eleven staples like beef jerky, hot dogs, doughnuts and potato
chips.
</P>
<P>
   Southland`s wine blitz is ``designed to reflect what our
customers want,'' said Dennis Phelps, 7-Eleven's alcoholic
beverages category manager. The convenience store giant is the
nation's largest vendor of beer, selling more than 30 million cases
a year, but its stores typically have carried only a few wines.
</P>
<P>
   Phelps said that the larger selection plus strategic placement
of Wine Spectator magazine are aimed at shoppers who may not want
to trudge down long aisles and stand in line at the supermarket
when they want to pick up a bottle of wine for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   7-Eleven's selection mirrors U.S. wine consumption patterns.
Seventy percent of the shelf space is devoted to domestic wines, 30
percent to imports. The company won't divulge current wine sales,
but Phelps said the company's goal is ``to triple our wine business
in the next four years.''
</P>
<P>
   In Oakland, 7-Eleven franchise owner Jin An said that wine is
probably his fourth-biggest sales category after gasoline, other
alcohol and beer. He attributes the popularity of premium wines and
micro-brews to his store's location on Piedmont Avenue near the
affluent &LR;   &LR; residents of the Oakland hills. Wine has about a 25
percent profit margin, according to An, which is less than for
Slurpees. (Americans drink more than 10 million of these slushy
drinks each month.)
</P>
<P>
   In October, An's store sold 590 bottles of wine for $3,416 and
the biggest seller was the 187.5-milliliter-sized bottle of
Vendange Chardonnay. An sold 98 of these smaller-than-a-cup
portions for $1.69 each.
</P>
<P>
   Vintners are pleased with 7-Eleven's new commitment to wine.
``This is an opportunity to broaden our market to yet another
distribution channel,'' said Kendall-Jackson spokesman James
Caudill. ``It's meaningful to us that people are looking for
popular wines in popular places.''
</P>
<P>
   The 7-Eleven campaign is another sign of the growing popularity
of wine, according to John De Luca, president of the Wine Institute
in San Francisco. ``People who buy wine are no longer boxed in
certain categories,'' he said. ``Besides food stores and
restaurants, winemakers increasingly sell overseas, by direct
shipment, in warehouse and discount stores and through convenience
stores like 7-Eleven.''

 Schwab Blocks Some Online Trading  &HT;       
 By Sam Zuckerman and Jon Swartz 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. temporarily suspended online trading of some
newly-issued stocks this week on concerns that many customers who
trade volatile, fast-moving stocks via computer don't understand
what they're doing.
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest online broker posted a notice on its
Internet site yesterday saying it wouldn't take electronic orders
for the stock of InfoSpace.com Inc., a Redmond, Wash., Internet
guide scheduled to go public next week. Customers were instructed
to contact Schwab by phone or in person to place orders for the
stock.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, &UR;  &LR; Schwab blocked online trading of Internet America
Inc. and AboveNet Communications Inc., two Internet companies that
went public that day.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco firm also stopped electronic trading that day
of Infinity Broadcasting Corp., the radio company that syndicates
shock jock Howard Stern, which was spun off by parent CBS Corp. in
a public offering.
</P>
<P>
   The broker resumed online trading of the three firms yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Schwab said online trading halts were needed to protect
clients from the huge, lightning-fast price moves that now
routinely happen when hot companies go public.
</P>
<P>
   Investors can either place a ``market order,'' meaning they'll
buy or sell shares at the current price, or a ``limit order,''
meaning they'll only trade shares at a specified price or better.
</P>
<P>
   When orders are placed online, there's no human broker who can
make sure the customers understand the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   As stocks of Internet companies have doubled or tripled and then
fallen back on the day they went public, Schwab said clients _ many
with stars in their eyes _ were often shocked to find they bought
stocks at prices far higher than electronic quotes they received.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Others were irritated when they weren't able to get shares at
all because stocks shot past price limits they set.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people put in (market) orders and don't understand when
they end up paying a lot more'' than they expected, said Tracey
Gordon, a Schwab spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   On its customer Web site, Schwab said it blocked orders for
InfoSpace because of ``volatility and fast-market conditions''
which it said ``could result in price quotes significantly
different from the current trading price.''
</P>
<P>
   By routing trades of volatile IPO stocks through a human broker,
Schwab can ensure that customers understand that they may not get
shares at the prices they expect, said Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all to help the customer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts warned that such restrictions could anger clients
who have been led to believe that online trading is the most modern
and efficient way to invest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could make the customer say, `Maybe this isn't such a
wonderful channel for trading stocks,''' said Piper Jaffray analyst
Stephen Franco.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one Schwab customer who plans to buy InfoSpace shares
said he was furious that he won't be able to do so by computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have to hold on the telephone for 20 minutes to get my
order in,'' said Jack Diamond, a 69-year-old Carrollton, Texas,
resident.
</P>
<P>
   Rival online brokers said they don't plan similar halts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pure-play electronic. This is our business model,''
said Lisa Nash, a spokeswoman for Palo Alto's E-Trade.
</P>
<P>
   Ameritrade, based in Omaha, Neb., telephones clients who order
hot IPOs to make sure they understand the risks, an official said.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab is reacting to two related developments that have
profoundly altered retail stock brokerage: the breakneck growth of
online trading and the huge increase in stock volatility,
especially for hot new issues. Individual investors are flocking to
computer-based stock trading, which has gone from insignificant
levels three years ago to an estimated 20 percent of all retail
brokerage transactions today. Online trades represent more than
half of the 121,000 transactions Schwab handles every business day.
</P>
<P>
   Investors' ability to buy shares with a few mouse clicks has
boosted demand for hot IPOs, contributing to wild price swings. For
example, stock in eBay Inc., the Internet swap meet, nearly tripled
on its first day of trading September 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``By suspending trading, maybe they can modulate the
shooting-gallery atmosphere we have online,'' said David Simons,
managing director at Digital Video Investments in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Internet America, AboveNet, theglobe.com, Ticketmaster
Online-CitySearch, uBid, Xoom.com, InfoSpace.com, EarthWeb and
Claimsnet.com have all gone public during the past six weeks,
triggering a surge in online trading.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts speculated Schwab's may be partly motivated by the
strain on its computers triggered by heavy IPO orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect (Schwab is) scared off by the mind-boggling demand
for Internet stocks,'' said a high-placed InfoSpace source.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab's average daily trades rose 18 percent in November from
the previous month, coinciding with the latest IPO feeding frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Keynote Systems, a San Mateo company that monitors commercial
Web traffic, noted a dramatic slowdown in Schwab's online
performance over the past month. It took users an average of 78
seconds to access Schwab's commercial home page yesterday
afternoon, compared with 20 seconds the past few weeks and 10
seconds before that, according to Gene Shklar, Keynote's vice
president of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, at E-Trade, the second-biggest electronic stock
broker, it took between five and 17 seconds to download information
during test runs over the past six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab's Gordon said online trading restrictions are not a
result of any strain on its computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is absolutely not a Web capacity issue,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In a previous attempt to rein in Internet trades, Schwab,
E-Trade and several other online brokers in recent weeks raised
margin requirements _ the amount of cash customers must put up when
they buy stocks with borrowed money _ for Internet-related
companies as Amazon.com, eBay and Yahoo.

 &HT;    Schuerholz: Braves may accept higher payroll
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Operating out of a fifth-floor suite at the
Opryland Hotel, the Atlanta Braves front office was to have arrived
in Tennessee in a generous mood, with a bloated payroll that needed
venting.
</P>
<P>
   Just two hours after hitting town, John Schuerholz altered that
impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may decide to have a higher payroll,'' said the Braves
general manager, a mighty suggestion from the National League's
reigning payroll kings.
</P>
<P>
   The winter meetings opened Friday and those clubs that are
following the Braves around waiting to see whose contract gets
jettisoned figure to be disappointed. Though the club projected a
$65 million to $68 million payroll in October organizational
meetings, the 1999 payroll currently stands at $72.725 million with
18 players under contract and should exceed $74 million before the
signings are done.
</P>
<P>
   But while Atlanta has had preliminary discussions with several
teams about dealing Ryan Klesko, Schuerholz backed off the
importance of a payroll target and said the team is prepared to
spend more than first budgeted. Atlanta led the NL with a $61
million payroll in 1998 and is close to committing a 21 percent
increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the only reason we have to make a deal is we have to
off-load salary, we can do that almost any time, if the players
we're talking about are attractive to other teams. And they would
be,'' Schuerholz said. ``If we did have a particular position that
needed to be filled, if we were absent a second baseman or right
fielder or a shortstop, then we'd be out there to make a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to make a deal to diminish payroll.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Tampa Bay Devil Rays have sought Klesko, the Boston
Red Sox have a greater need for power and a first baseman to fill
Mo Vaughn's place. Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette is not due
to arrive until today but is expected to speak with Schuerholz
about Klesko. If the Braves want a young outfielder in return,
Boston can offer Trot Nixon or minor leaguers Michael Coleman or
Dernell Stenson.
</P>
<P>
   But Schuerholz sounds in no mood to deal. When the Braves dealt
Denny Neagle last month, the upshoot was the club would plow cash
back into position players. The Otis Nixon signing reflects that
new thinking, even though it leaves the team with three left
fielders (including Gerald Williams), since Brian Jordan will start
daily in right field.
</P>
<P>
   Even at $74 million, the Braves rank far below the AL payroll
leaders. Baltimore is projecting an $80 million payroll, while the
Yankees should reach $80 million.
</P>
<P>
   But those teams waiting for Atlanta to dump a contract may be
waiting come March. Asked what he wanted to do in the next four
days, Schuerholz replied, ``Talk, listen, find out what other
people are doing. You never know when somebody may approach you
with an idea that's interesting. Based on the conversations I've
had with people so far prior to these meetings, I don't expect
anything like that to happen.''

SPORTS COLUMN: WHERE CHARITY BEGINS
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the most significant lockout news of the week, pro basketball
players announced a charity game in Atlantic City, N.J. They were
then criticized for waffling on the beneficiaries. At first, it was
said that the proceeds would go to charity, with some going to
players who have been financially pinched by the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   Facing howls of criticism, mostly from the news media, the
players backed off and announced that all the proceeds would go to
charity. The commentators had been indignant that salaried
employees making a minimum of $275,000 would need to be bailed out.
</P>
<P>
   This criticism is troubling on two counts.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``Father's Knows Best''/Dr. Huxtable world in which the
critics apparently live, things always turn out all right: a white
picket fence with freshly baked cookies. Money is rarely an issue,
never a problem.
</P>
<P>
   In the real world things are not so genteel. The father in
``Father Knows Best'' attended Alcoholics Anonymous during the
making of the show. Dr. Huxtable's alter ego disclosed that he had
had an extramarital affair. In real-life families overspend, live
on a fragile economic precipice. Three or four missed paychecks can
wreck a world. Or come close.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Stanley, the agent for Keyshawn Johnson of the Jets, also
represents the NBA players Gerald Madkins, Todd Day and Lucious
Harris _ hardly household names. ``Between them they have 12
dependent children, 12 dependent adults,'' Stanley said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, the negative media reaction is simply a
response to an ill-conceived game. More subtly, it is an indirect
rebuke of the players for not saving for a rainy day. But the
criticism runs deeper than that and cuddles up to a deep-seated
paternalism that often places the news media closer to management
than to players. It's all right for players to make money for
owners, to keep the plantation lit and warm. But take a step _ even
an uncertain baby step _ toward autonomy, and the whip-wielders
crack the whip. Tell the players to get back, move back where they
belong. And they move back.
</P>
<P>
   In backing off charity, the players ignored an ancient
principle: Charity begins at home. The players have a right _ an
obligation _ to use their skills to make money for themselves, to
hold each other together, to bail each other out and to give the
public what it wants: professional basketball.
</P>
<P>
   The more crucial concept is autonomy. The NBA as it exists today
is the successor to a string of leagues and associations that
failed, crumbled and were put back together. As ill conceived as
the proposed Dec. 19 exhibition game may be, it is the germ of a
good idea. Players need an infrastructure, and the infrastructure
needs players _ to a greater extent, perhaps, than the owners
realize.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1987 National Football League strike, the striking
players staged a game in Los Angeles at the Coliseum. The game
flopped. The owners countered with games using replacement players;
those were more successful.
</P>
<P>
   But football relies on licensing and uses anonymous images
colliding every 25 seconds as background music. In professional
basketball, by contrast, the players are essential. The owners,
under the commissioner's direction, have created a league based on
a collage of images. Fans won't pay to see David Stern make
presentations, or for Pat Riley to prance up and down the sideline.
They might not pay for isolated all-star games, either. Fans, as
Stanley correctly noted, ``want the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They want the team, the colors, the logo, the history,'' he
said. ``That's something the players can tap into.'' Games
organized by the players will draw a different type of fan, a fan
whom the players have largely lost direct contact with, a fan they
see _ some of them see _ only during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Fans will come to see Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant wearing
purple and gold, leading a team simply called Los Angeles, against
a team from New York, led by Patrick Ewing, in orange and blue.
Fans will pay to see Scottie Pippen in a modified uniform of red
and black play an Indiana team led by Reggie Miller in yellow and
blue. Fans will pay to see players playing hard in games that
count, with professional officials and coaches. Secure a contract
to televise games on cable, devise an abbreviated playoff system.
</P>
<P>
   Would the mainstream media outlets cover such games? Are pro
games legitimate only under the auspices of the NBA? We shall see.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the games are all about charity, of one kind or
another. One comes through the front door, the other comes through
the back.
</P>
<P>

THE METS AND HENDERSON ARE CLOSING IN ON A DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ General Manager Steve Phillips of the Mets is
not scheduled to arrive at the first winter meetings in major
league baseball since 1992 until Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   But by Saturday evening, Phillips could finally have Rickey
Henderson signed, most likely to a one-year deal with an option for
a second. And Kevin Brown could be signed by someone else for six
years or more.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips is scheduled to meet with Henderson's representatives
at the spacious _ and chaotic _ Opryland Hotel shortly after his
arrival here. When asked Friday if Henderson could come to an
agreement with the Mets by Saturday, one of Henderson's agents, Dan
Horwits, replied, ``We might be able to.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, the Mets might be able to fill their needs for an
everyday left fielder and leadoff hitter.
</P>
<P>
   In an interesting twist, Tony Phillips, 39, who played left
field and batted leadoff for the Mets for the final two months of
last season, agreed Friday to a one-year deal with the Oakland
Athletics, the team for which he played the first eight seasons of
his 18-year career and for whom Henderson stole a major league high
66 bases last season.
</P>
<P>
   The As had been interested in re-signing Henderson, who turns 40
in two weeks, but once they chose not to offer him salary
arbitration, they lost the right to negotiate with him until May 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Mariners had also expressed interest in Henderson,
but that apparently evaporated before these meetings. Manager Lou
Piniella said Friday that Seattle had expressed interest in Yankee
left fielder Chad Curtis.
</P>
<P>
   All of which leaves the Mets as Henderson's only suitor. Earlier
this week, Steve Phillips offered him a one-year contract in the
neighborhood of $1.7 million with performance bonuses and an option
for a second year that would automatically kick in if Henderson
meets certain requirements.
</P>
<P>
   When Horwits was asked today if Henderson was amenable to
playing for the Mets, the agent said, ``Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   He may have no other choice. That is not the case for Brown or
Roger Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't see how we can leave here without a deal being done,''
Toronto General Manager Gord Ash said in reference to Clemens, the
five-time Cy Young Award winner who has demanded a trade from
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Ash said that five teams were still in the running and that
nothing had changed from Thursday. The five teams are believed to
be Houston, Texas, the Yankees, Anaheim and Cleveland. And although
the Yankees are considered a long shot, their owner George
Steinbrenner has reversed his position and ordered his general
manager, Brian Cashman, to be here either late Saturday night or
Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   As for Brown, his agent, Scott Boras, said Friday night that he
had already met with four teams and had two more meetings scheduled
Froday night and two others Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that we certainly had enough conversations that
we're very close to making a decision,'' Boras said. ``It could
come together as soon as tomorrow, certainly by Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers, the Baltimore Orioles, the St. Louis
Cardinals and the Colorado Rockies are believed to be competing for
the 33-year-old right-hander. And Kevin Towers, the San Diego
general manager, said Friday night that he was doing all he could
to re-sign Brown, even though Brown would apparently like to sign
for the highest average annual amount in baseball, somewhere around
$14 million.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Phillips going to Oakland, the only other move today
saw the Cincinnati Reds sign the left-hander Steve Avery to a
one-year deal for $1.5 million, with another million in performance
bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   With the newly acquired Denny Neagle and Avery, the Reds have
obtained two former Atlanta Braves left-handers for their starting
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Avery, 10-7 for the Boston Red Sox last year, was happy to be
back in the National League. ``I like hitting and I like the
National League cities,'' he said. ``That's not a knock on the
American League, but I think if you're a pitcher, you like the
National, and if you're a hitter, you like the American.''

 &HT;    Death penalty filings likely
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ With two executions already halted by a
challenge to Texas' secretive clemency process, state officials
braced Friday for the possibility that some of the eight other
convicts now scheduled for lethal injection may file for similar
court orders.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, though, no other challenges were
reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly possible,'' said one official. ``And based on
what's happened, if you had an execution date, you'd be stupid not
to file.''
</P>
<P>
   Next up for execution is James Meanes, 42, a former Ohio parolee
who is scheduled to die just after 6 p.m. Tuesday for the April
1981 shooting death of an armored-car guard during a million-dollar
heist in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Seven others are scheduled to be executed through April 13.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks of Austin blocked
the executions of convicted murderers Danny Lee Barber and Joseph
Stanley Faulder, a Canadian whose case drew international protest.
Barber was to have been executed Wednesday and Faulder on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Faulder's attorneys convinced Sparks that there are enough
questions about the legality of Texas' clemency process that his
death sentence should not have been carried out on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Clemency reviews in Texas are conducted secretly by the
18-member parole board, based on criteria that have never been
specified publicly. Voting also is not done in public.
</P>
<P>
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Sparks' order in
Barber's case, and the U.S. Supreme Court blocked Faulder's
execution shortly before it was to have taken place.
</P>
<P>
   Ward Tisdale, a spokesman for Attorney General Dan Morales, said
state lawyers are awaiting word on what will happen next with the
challenges filed by Barber and Faulder. He would not speculate on
what broader effects the execution-blocking court orders in those
cases might have.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks has scheduled a Dec. 21 hearing in the Faulder case and
one the following day in Barber's. Tisdale said the state is
confident the clemency system is not legally flawed and will seek
to have Sparks cancel his orders so the executions can be
rescheduled.
</P>
<P>
   In stopping the Faulder execution, court filings in Washington
showed Friday, Justice Antonin Scalia gave no timetable for when
the Supreme Court might take further action in the case _ even on
what specific issues it is reviewing.
</P>
<P>
   Faulder's attorneys, in filings with the high court last month,
contended that prosecutors illegally withheld evidence during the
trial, that some testimony against Faulder was false and that
Faulder was illegally denied a chance to consult with Canadian
authorities in Texas after his arrest in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   It is that last contention _ that police violated the 1963
Vienna Convention on Consular Relations _ that has drawn much of
the protest in Faulder's case in recent months. Under the treaty,
foreigners jailed in the United States have to be allowed to
contact diplomats from their country.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his arrest, Texas officials have said, Faulder
was carrying a Colorado driver's licence and had applied for one in
Texas. He did not assert his Canadian citizenship until years
later, after he had been imprisoned and was appealing his
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   In an affidavit filed with the Supreme Court, though, Faulder
insists that if he had been told about his right to Canadian
counsel, he would have ``wanted their assistance in understanding
my rights under American law, since the American criminal justice
system was completely strange to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the eight executions scheduled through April 13, five now
appear likely to be carried out on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each one of those has two stars ... a system we use to show
they already have gone through the federal habeas process once,''
Tisdale said. ``One star means it's their first time through, and
they're probably not going (to be executed). Two stars and they're
pretty much a goner.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Barber and Faulder had two stars. ``They got lucky,''
Tisdale said.

 &HT;    Florida lawyers' windfall from tobacco deal more than $3.4
billion
 &HT;    By Scott Hiaasen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The lawyers who took on the tobacco
industry on behalf of Florida were vindicated with a historic
windfall Friday when a panel of arbitrators said they were entitled
to more than $3.4 billion in legal fees, or roughly 25 percent of
the state's $13 billion settlement with cigarette makers.
</P>
<P>
   The award, thought to be the largest legal fee ever paid for a
single case, was lambasted as ``outrageous'' by the tobacco
industry, which chose arbitration as the method for paying its
opponents' legal fees in the national battle over the public costs
of smoking.
</P>
<P>
   The three-person panel also awarded $3.3 billion and $1.4
billion, respectively, to lawyers in similar lawsuits in Texas and
Mississippi. The money will be paid over at least 10 years _ and
possibly decades _ from a fund set aside by cigarette makers with a
$500 million annual cap.
</P>
<P>
   Under the industry's agreements with the states, the panel's
decision is final and not subject to appeal _ though industry
lawyers were carefully inspecting the panel's findings Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it shakes the conscience of the courts,'' said Scott
Williams, a spokesman for the industry. ``You can't say the
attorneys in these cases are solely responsible for the result.''
</P>
<P>
   In each case, the panel voted 2-1 for the fees, with panelist
Charles Renfrew dissenting. Renfrew, a retired federal judge chosen
by the industry, said the panel was given too little time to
determine the fees and was hampered because the lawyers did not
keep track of the hours they worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are limits, even in these cases, as to the amount the
attorneys should be paid,'' Renfrew said in his dissent. ``Each of
the three state awards rendered by the majority is clearly
excessive and to me incomprehensible.''
</P>
<P>
   Siding with the lawyers in Florida's case were panelists Harry
Huge, a lawyer chosen by the trial team; and John Calhoun Wells,
chosen by both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without these outside counsel, there would be no multi-billion
dollar settlements for the states to reimburse tobacco-related
health expenses,'' Wells said.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's decision was praised by Florida officials and the
state's trial team, who, after more than a year of squabbling, both
got what they wanted in the end: The lawyers were paid a 25 percent
fee, as spelled out in the contract they signed with the state when
they took the case; and the state successfully placed the burden of
paying the lawyers on the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the state their money, and now we've been fully
compensated,'' said David Fonvielle, a Tallahassee lawyer on the
trial team. ``How much better can it get for the people of
Florida?''
</P>
<P>
   The trial lawyers said they deserved the fee because they took
on the risk of fighting the previously unstoppable industry. The
lawyers paid their expenses on their own, and had they lost, they
would have received nothing.
</P>
<P>
   As the case plodded toward a 1997 trial date, the lawyers took
more than 200 depositions, attended 150 court hearings, handled
nine appeals and produced more than 500 million pieces of paper.
These details were contained in the lawyers' application to the
arbitrators, along with the fee contract and videotaped interviews
with, among others, Gov. Lawton Chiles and Attorney General Bob
Butterworth.
</P>
<P>
   The state settled with cigarette makers in 1997 for $11 billion
over 25 years, while jury selection was underway in West Palm
Beach. In addition, the state won more than $1.7 billion this year
under a provision that allows Florida to adopt benefits of future
lawsuits. The arbitrators calculated Florida's total settlement as
$13.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Montgomery, a West Palm Beach lawyer who long opposed
arbitration before agreeing to it earlier this month, said the
decision affirms that the fee contract was not excessive, as Palm
Beach County Circuit Judge Harold Cohen had deemed it in a ruling
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery and two other trial lawyers, Bob Kerrigan and Sheldon
Schlesinger , fought for their contract all the way to the Florida
Supreme Court, and Montgomery sued other trial team members, saying
they improperly agreed to go to arbitration on behalf of the whole
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It cost us an awful lot in aggravation in order to protect our
contract in the first place, but I feel very happy about it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the $3.4 billion exists only on paper, and
several lawyers said they didn't expect to collect that much. How
much they will get per year depends on how many states take part in
arbitration in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette makers have set aside $500 million per year to pay the
legal fees not only for Florida, Mississippi and Texas, but also in
lawsuits filed by 46 other states. Those suits were recently
settled for a combined $206 billion.
</P>
<P>
   As lawyers from those states go through arbitration, more
lawyers will be drawing on the pot, said Joe Rice, a Charleston,
S.C. lawyer involved in the Florida suit and dozens of others.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers from Florida and Mississippi will first divide $250
million because they settled in 1997. They along with Texas'
lawyers will also share $500 million set aside for this year, with
the amounts dependent upon the size of the state settlements. That
money should be paid by the end of this year, Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the industry's settlement payments to the states, the
legal fees will not be adjusted for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's $3.4 billion will be split among 11 law firms, though
a 12th lawyer, Tim Howard of Tallahassee, says he's also entitled
to a share.
</P>
<P>
   Two out-of-state firms involved in about 40 other tobacco
lawsuits will share 46 percent _ $1.56 billion _ of the Florida
fees; the rest will be divided among the lawyers in Florida, with
each firm collecting about 6 percent of the total _ or $204
million.
</P>
<P>
   Rice said his firm must also pay Fred Levin, the Pensacola
lawyer who assembled the trial team and encouraged legislators to
pass the 1994 law that allowed Florida to pursue the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Howard says he, too, should get part of the fee because he also
signed the contract. But the rest of the trial lawyers say he was
their employee. Howard's lawyer recently said Howard will probably
sue the other lawyers to claim his share.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco stock analysts said Friday's announcement won't affect
tobacco companies because of the annual cap. Gary Black, an analyst
with Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co. in New York, said he figured the
entire cost of all the settlements, including lawyers' fees, will
cost tobacco companies 43 cents on each pack ofcigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   But the 45-cent-a-pack price hike tobacco firms announced before
Thanksgiving will more than cover the costs, Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Major tobacco stocks weren't affected Friday, with Philip Morris
Cos. Inc. (NYSE: MO) closing up 63 cents at $52.94 a share, and RJR
Nabisco Holdings Corp. (NYSE: RN), the parent of R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Co., ending the day up 13 cents at $28.31 a share.
</P>
<P>
   How much each tobacco company will contribute to the fees is
based on their market share, Williams said. As of Oct. 31, Philip
Morris held 48.5 percent of the market, followed by RJ Reynolds
with 24.8 percent, and Brown and Williamson with 15.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide business groups reacted with harsh vitriol. Bill
Herrle, Florida director of the National Federation of Independent
Business, said the award was a dangerous precedent that will
encourage lawyers to pursue needless suits against businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This certainly illustrates the obscene excesses that trial
lawyers are capable of,'' Herrle said. ``They are capable of
destroying an industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The House member charged with crafting last year's ``tort
reform'' bill _ and who ultimately voted against it because of
changes forced on it by leadership _ said business lobbyists are
exaggerating the implications of paying all that money to trial
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers winning the fees were already wealthy enough to make
mischief, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys don't need seed money to do anything,'' said Rep.
Tom Warner, R-Stuart and himself a trial lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Fonvielle of the trial team also placed little credence in the
business lobby's rhetoric: ``I guarantee the lobbyists are all
going to be up there (in Tallahassee) fighting over this money that
we got for them.''

SUNY TRUSTEES ARE POISED TO ADOPT A CORE CURRICULUM FOR ALL
STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Led by a conservatively oriented board of trustees,
the State University of New York appears ready to overhaul its
undergraduate education by adopting a new core curriculum for all
students.
</P>
<P>
   For a generation or more, many colleges have allowed their
students wide latitude in fashioning their own course work. But on
Tuesday, the SUNY trustees are expected to adopt a well-defined
core curriculum _ roughly a year's worth of courses _ that they
deem necessary to produce a well-educated student.
</P>
<P>
   Ten individual courses will be required _ not only standards
like math, natural science, foreign language, Western civilization,
humanities and the arts, social sciences and American history, but
also less traditional requirements like ``basic communications and
reasoning,'' information technology and world civilizations other
than Western. The policy will apply to students entering the
university in the fall of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative groups applauded the measure as adding rigor to
SUNY's education, but opponents, including leaders of the
university's faculty senate, attacked it as overly restrictive.
They also criticized the board for failing to hold public
discussion on the specifics of the policy, which were decided this
week.
</P>
<P>
   SUNY officials at the Albany headquarters said they had been
troubled that students could take easy and narrowly defined courses
and graduate without huge swaths of knowledge. ``The most common
way students escape broad exposure is by choosing what they will
take,'' said Peter Salins, SUNY's provost, in support of the new
requirements. ``That is why we need a tight set of requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   Each college will define its own specifics, but the colleges
will be assessed on their programs, and financing from the central
university administration will be tied to how well they do.
</P>
<P>
   Some private institutions, like Columbia University, have
clearly designated core requirements that all students must pass,
but SUNY officials say they could not find any other public
university system that had prescribed such a core for all of its
colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia's ``great books'' curriculum requires undergraduates to
spend nearly half of their freshman and sophomore years studying
landmark works in Western civilization. The University of Chicago
has a similarly rigorous core.
</P>
<P>
   But now, after attacks by the conservative National Association
of Scholars about the lack of rigor in public higher education, the
issue of a core curriculum for state universities has been raised
in several states, including Pennsylvania and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that SUNY is a leader here,'' said Tom
Carroll, chairman of the Center for Excellence in Higher Education,
a conservative research organization in the Albany area.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Daniels, a trustee and co-chairman of the subcommittee
that developed the new policy, said the trustees ``are committed to
raising academic standards.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Employers, parents and students deserve no less,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   SUNY officials said Friday that the 15-member board appeared to
have more than enough votes to pass the new curriculum policy at
its monthly meeting on Tuesday. ``I think it will pass,'' said
Candace de Russy, another trustee who has pressed for the core
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of a tightly prescribed curriculum applauded SUNY's
direction, saying that it was the only way to insure that students
learned what they needed to become educated citizens and skilled
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the current system, what the students learn is hit or
miss,'' said Carroll, who wrote a study in 1996 that criticized
SUNY standards. ``SUNY's new general-education standards would help
insure that all of its graduates are broadly educated.''
</P>
<P>
   But some critics said the policy as drawn up was overly specific
and did not leave enough leeway for the colleges or their students.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just flies in the face of the principle that the board
has set out that each campus should develop its own distinct
mission and academic program,'' said Vincent Aceto, president of
SUNY's University Faculty Senate. ``And it clearly reaches over
into areas that have traditionally been the prerogative of the
faculty.''
</P>
<P>
   He and others were also incensed that the specific policy was
not available for discussion before being put to a vote Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lack of discussion of the policy with the
affected campuses,'' said Arnold B. Gardner, a longtime trustee who
often disagrees with the Pataki-appointed trustees, who he says are
trying to micromanage the university. ``There are monetary
consequences. There are academic policy issues. And none of this
has been discussed.''
</P>
<P>
   The policy would apply initially to 29 senior college and
university campuses, but SUNY's 30 community colleges would be
strongly encouraged to go along so that their students could
transfer more easily to the four-year colleges.

SOCCER COACH RESIGNS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With controversy swirling around the program and
his status in limbo, Cal State Northridge women's soccer coach
Brian Wiesner, the only head coach in the program's four-year
existence, resigned Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Players were told about the resignation, which is effective
Dec.31, during a 3 p.m. team meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not happy, but I think our team needs a change,'' junior
goalkeeper Tawni Takagi said. ``As a coach he was respected, but
sometimes as a person it was questionable.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN administrators wanted to see a marked improvement this
season, but the Matadors finished a lackluster 6-13, 3-4 in the Big
Sky Conference. Wiesner, who was 20-53-4 with the Matadors after a
12-year run at Cal Poly Pomona, was in the last month of his
contract and said negotiations for a new contract didn't take
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program wasn't as successful as I wanted it to be,''
Wiesner said. ``It's a challenge to get a new program to where you
want it. I wanted to be further along than it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant coach Allison Lee will handle the day-to-day
operations of the team. CSUN assistant athletic director Brian
Swanson said a national search will take place, but one interested
party is already in the athletic department.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will officially apply and I would love to get it,'' men's
soccer coach Marwan Ass'ad said. ``I think our women's soccer
program can go to the playoffs every year. I have great contacts
across Southern California. All the women's coaches know me. I
think it's one of the best jobs. Period.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiesner earned $37,956 annually. Ass'ad, whose sport was
temporarily axed a year ago, said his salary is $18,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
   Wiesner was criticized heavily because he didn't recruit well in
the soccer-rich San Fernando Valley. Only four players on this
fall's roster attended area high schools. Wiesner, 40, never became
a member of the community, continuing to live in Claremont in
eastern Los Angeles County.
</P>
<P>
   Ass'ad, 44, began his career at CSUN in 1983 and built the
Matadors men's program into a Division II power. Six times the
Matadors went the NCAA Division II playoffs before jumping to
Division I. This past season CSUN went 12-5. Ass'ad is 192-102-26
in 16 seasons at CSUN.
</P>
<P>
   Ass'ad coaches various girls' club teams in the area. Takagi, a
Chatsworth High graduate, has known him for some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like him as the coach, but that's me speaking,'' Takagi
said. ``What I could base my opinion on is the respect his players
have for him. If we could have that, it would be great.''
</P>
<P>
   There was growing unrest inside the program, particularly this
season. There was a shoving match between Wiesner and Lee during an
Oct.24 game at Idaho State. CSUN investigated the issue, but a
formal complaint wasn't filed.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators also voiced concern that players were
transferring out of CSUN at an unusual rate.

WITH RECORDS IN HAND, WILLIAMS EYES THE HEISMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (lb) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Before his final game as a Texas Longhorn, Ricky
Williams needed 63 yards to best Tony Dorsett's 22-year-old NCAA
Division I career-rushing record. His coach, Mack Brown, was
worried. The Longhorns were playing hated rival Texas A&AMP;M and Brown
knew Heisman Trophy voters needed one final push to cast their vote
for his splendid runner.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams wasn't worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach, I'll get the 63 yards. I'm going to get 135 because
that breaks the 2,000-yard mark,'' Williams told Brown a few days
before the game. ``And the record I really want is 263 yards
because that would break Napoleon McCallum's record for all-purpose
yards.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he asked Brown for the first time all season for some
special consideration. If he was close to McCallum late in the
game, Williams asked, would Brown let him return a kickoff?
</P>
<P>
   It never came down to that. With eight minutes left in the
Longhorns' 26-24 upset victory, Williams owned Dorsett's and
McCallum's records and all or part of 14 other National Collegiate
Athletic Association Division I marks. He would finish with 259
rushing yards and 36 receiving against the Aggies to close out a
career that saw him rumble for 6,279 yards on the ground and 7,206
overall, including kick returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach, I don't need that kickoff,'' he told Brown on the
sidelines that day in a bit of understatement that made both smile.
``I'm going to be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   More than that, he was going to be honored.
</P>
<P>
   So far this week, Williams has been presented the Maxwell Award
as college football's outstanding player and a second consecutive
Doak Walker Award for best running back _ both of which will find a
place alongside the Walter Camp Foundation and Associated Press
Player of the Year trophies already on the shelf in his mother's
apartment in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the Heisman Trophy that has brought him to New York
and the Downtown Athletic Club, where in a national telecast
Saturday evening he is expected to be awarded the most coveted
honor in college football. For Williams, it is almost certain to be
a far different Heisman ceremony from last year's.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Williams will be center stage, unlike a year ago,
when he finished fifth in the voting and wasn't even invited to
attend the Heisman announcement, a snub he called
``heartbreaking.'' Second, Williams is expected to be the
overwhelming choice in the Heisman voting, whereas a year ago
Michigan defensive back Charles Woodson upset Tennessee quarterback
Peyton Manning by a 1,815-to-1,543 margin.
</P>
<P>
   When the announcement is made Saturday night, Williams will be
sharing the podium with the other three top candidates _ all of
them quarterbacks who have put up spectacular numbers and have
garnered their share of postseason honors.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's Cade McNown was in Louisville, Ky., on Friday accepting
the Johnny Unitas Award after throwing for 3,130 yards, 23
touchdowns and leading the Bruins to a 10-1 regular season that
ended painfully with a 49-45 loss at Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The senior threw for 5 touchdowns and 531 yards that afternoon,
but couldn't muster one more comeback in a season full of them that
would have put UCLA into a national-title game in the Fiesta Bowl.
Instead, UCLA will play Wisconsin in the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Kansas State's Michael Bishop's final regular season
ended in depressing fashion when the Wildcats got bounced from the
Fiesta Bowl because of a 36-33 overtime loss against Texas A&AMP;M in
the Big 12 Championship. Bishop won the Davey O'Brien National
Quarterback Award this week after passing for 2,844 yards and 23
touchdowns, running for 14 more and leading a team with little
football tradition to the brink of a national-title game.
</P>
<P>
   He, too, had a heroic final outing _ 442 total yards against the
Aggies _ but it was his fourth-quarter fumble that allowed Texas
A&AMP;M to force overtime. The Wildcats' (11-1) loss, combined with the
need of bowl organizers to sell tickets, dropped Kansas State out
of the major bowls all the way to San Antonio and the Alamo Bowl
against an 8-4 Purdue team.
</P>
<P>
   The only underclassman in the Heisman's top four is the Kentucky
quarterback, Tim Couch. In an all-out passing attack dubbed ``Air
Raid'' in the Bluegrass State, the junior threw for 4,275 yards and
36 touchdowns this season. The Wildcats (7-4) will face Penn State
in the Outback Bowl, but Couch's real reward will come later. He is
expected to be a first-round choice, but has not decided if he will
declare early or return for his senior year.
</P>
<P>
   The contending quarterbacks' selection for the Heisman Trophy?
Each has cast his vote for Williams and, having done so, is intent
on enjoying the trip to New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``He runs hard and I kind of like the guy anyway,'' said McNown,
whose team beat Texas early in the season. ``While he gives credit
to his teammates, they have really asked him to carry the load and
he has responded. When teams have focused on him, he has managed to
shake off defenders and make some big runs. I don't think there are
many guys who are as valuable to their team as he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Couch, Williams faced a critical decision this time last
year. He was projected as a top-five draft pick and, after the
Longhorns suffered through a disappointing 4-7 season, thought hard
about leaving college. Instead, he returned for his senior year and
rushed for 2,124 yards, and the Longhorns went 8-3 in Brown's first
season as coach. They will meet Mississippi State in the Cotton
Bowl. And that, he says, means far more than the crowded shelf of
hardware. Almost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came back to win games, not to win awards,'' he said of his
final season with Texas. ``But I thought I had good numbers last
year and wasn't invited, so it would be nice to win.''

TOBACCO GROUP FUNNELED LOBBYING MONEY THROUGH RESTAURANT ALLIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn.)  (rl) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The tobacco industry's trade group acknowledged
Friday that it had spent far more than it had disclosed on an
unsuccessful effort to persuade the state government to scale back
anti-smoking laws adopted by New York City and other localities.
</P>
<P>
   The Tobacco Institute originally reported that its lobbying
expenditures in 1995 were $110,132. Friday, in settling a complaint
before the state lobbying commission, it acknowledged the total was
actually $553,204.
</P>
<P>
   Under New York lobbying laws, the trade group was not penalized,
prompting the commission's chairman to concede that the rules
needed to be toughened.
</P>
<P>
   After New York City and some nearby localities banned smoking in
most restaurants in 1994-95, the tobacco industry took its fight to
Albany. It hoped to get the state to approve relatively lax rules
that would supersede the local ones.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry formed a coalition with the Empire State
Restaurant and Tavern Association. Some smoking opponents at the
time questioned whether the industry was funneling some of its
lobbying money through its ally. Friday, the Tobacco Institute
essentially confirmed those suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, known as the New York Temporary State Commission
on Lobbying, began its investigation after receiving a complaint
from three groups _ the New York Public Interest Research Group,
Common Cause New York and the League of Women Voters of New York.
</P>
<P>
   The groups sent the commission a copy of a document that was
contained in court papers in the lawsuit that Minnesota filed
against the tobacco industry. The document showed the industry's
lobbying expenditures for 1995, including those for New York State.
The amount was far higher than that which the trade group had
disclosed to New York regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The Tobacco Institute, which declined to comment Friday, did not
dispute the complaints or the commission's findings. But under
state law, the group was able to avoid any penalty simply by
amending its disclosure forms.
</P>
<P>
   According to the findings, the Tobacco Institute funneled
$443,072 in 1995 to the Empire State Restaurant and Tavern
Association with the intent of having the association use the money
to lobby the Legislature on what was known as the smoking
pre-emption bill.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the settlement, the restaurant association
acknowledged under-reporting its lobbying by $383,285, which the
commission determined was the amount of Tobacco Institute money
that was actually spent by the restaurant association on lobbying.
The restaurant association was not penalized.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Wexler, executive director of the association, said it was
not admitting that it had broken the law, but merely seeking an
expeditious way of ending the matter. He said the association still
believed that it had spent the money from the Tobacco Institute on
items, such as polling, that did not come under the lobbying law.
</P>
<P>
   The lobbying commission's chairman, Milton Mollen, said the
tobacco case demonstrated that the legislature should heed the
commission's longstanding request for more power. ``The laws should
be clarified and expanded,'' he said.

PARTISAN PANEL VOTES TO IMPEACH CLINTON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A sharply divided, highly partisan House Judiciary
Committee on Friday recommended removing President Clinton from
office, setting up a momentous impeachment vote next week by the
House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   The committee approved three articles of impeachment, two of
them accusing Clinton of lying under oath and another saying he
obstructed justice in an effort to conceal his affair with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth article, which alleges that Clinton misused his office
in an attempt to cover-up his affair, was scheduled for debate by
the Republican-controlled committee early Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The first article was approved as dusk fell on the nation's
capital and less than 10 minutes after Clinton made an
extraordinary, nationally televised plea from the White House for a
punishment less than impeachment, which would lead to a Senate
trial that could end his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never should have misled the country, the Congress, my
friends or my family. Quite simply, I gave into my shame,'' Clinton
said, adding that his fate is in the hands of the public and the
Congress. ``Should they determine that my errors of word and deeds
require their rebuke and censure, I am ready to accept that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's critics, many of them at the forefront of the effort
to drive him from office, were unmoved, and moments later he became
only the third president in U.S. history to be accused by the
Judiciary Committee of an impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He couldn't even admit what his attorneys have admitted for
him, that he misled the court,'' said Rep. Bob Barr, a Georgia
Republican who 13 months ago, before the Lewinsky affair became
public, called for Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steve Chabot, an Ohio Republican on the committee, said the
president's effort to woo undecided House members fell short. ``I
don't think this is going to get him off the hook at this late
date,'' Chabot said. ``It's not going to make a significant
difference to any members sitting on the fence.''
</P>
<P>
   When advance word of Clinton's latest mea culpa was whispered to
Judiciary Committee members, most of them hustled out of the
oak-panelled Room 2141 of the Rayburn Office Building and huddled
around television sets to watch the president.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, the committee members shuffled back to their
seats in the room where, 24 years earlier, articles of impeachment
were approved to remove President Nixon for his role in the
Watergate scandal. Faced with a certain impeachment vote by the
full House and no support in the Senate, Nixon resigned a week
later.
</P>
<P>
   Much as their predecessors almost a quarter-century ago,
Judiciary Committee members Friday stared straight ahead, most with
no expression, as they responded joylessly when their names were
called by Shawn Friesen, the committee clerk two years out of
college.
</P>
<P>
   The audience sat quietly, reporters scribbled notes and
television cameras panned the committee room as each of the
Republicans responded ``aye'' and the Democrats called out ``no''
as the roll was called.
</P>
<P>
   Friesen counted the votes, then reported: ``Mr. Chairman, there
are 21 aye, 16 nay.''
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., looked around the room
and asked: ``Have all voted who wish to?'' There was no response.
The Illinois Republican rapped his gavel on the dais and called
out: ``Then Article 1 is agreed to.''
</P>
<P>
   The clock read 4:25 p.m. EST, and Clinton had been formally
accused by the committee of lying to a federal grand jury. The
charge stems from his Aug. 17 testimony before the panel, which was
being used by independent counsel Kenneth Starr to investigate the
president's affair with Lewinsky and attempt to keep it secret.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later, the committee voted again, and Article 2 was
approved. It accuses Clinton of lying during his Jan. 17 sworn
testimony in the Paula Jones lawsuit. The article of impeachment
was approved 20-17. Rep. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina
Republican who long has opposed impeachment for lying in a civil
lawsuit, had sided with the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   After another three hours of rancorous debate, the committee
approved Article 3 accusing Clinton of obstruction of justice by
allegedly interfering in the Jones lawsuit on several different
occasions. The vote was 21-16, again with all Republicans voting to
impeach and the Democrats voting against.
</P>
<P>
   Article 4, which the committee is scheduled to consider
Saturday, would accuse Clinton of abusing the power of his office
by making false statements to aides, his Cabinet and to the public.
The article also accuses him of misusing his executive privilege in
an effort to keep aides from cooperating with Starr's
investigation. Clinton also is accused in this article of making
false statements in response to inquiries from the Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Chabot said his vote to push for Clinton's removal was made
easier by his behavior. The president ``lied so many times in so
many forums it's really hard to keep track of it all,'' Chabot
said. ``For the children of this nation, this president has to be
impeached.''
</P>
<P>
   By passing the articles, the committee assured that the House _
for only the second time in U.S. history _ will vote on whether to
impeach the president. House members have been alerted by Speaker
Newt Gingrich to return to Washington by midweek to consider
impeaching the president.
</P>
<P>
   If the full House approves any of the articles recommended by
the Judiciary Committee, Clinton will join Reconstruction-era
President Andrew Johnson as the only chief executives to face
Senate trial on charges of ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' that
could lead to removal from office. Johnson's trial in 1868 ended
with his acquittal, and he continued as president until leaving
office in 1869.
</P>
<P>
   Signaling the prospect that the Senate could be asked to sit as
a jury, with Chief Justice William Rehnquist presiding, Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Minority Leader Thomas A.
Daschle, D-S.D., issued a rare joint statement saying they would
not make any comment ``unless and until the full House, by its
action, makes it clear that this body has a specific constitutional
duty to consider'' the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a crucial week for the Clinton presidency and for the
Constitution,'' said Texas Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, one of the
president's most vocal defenders on the committee. ``Contrary to
the will of the American people, the House Republican impeachment
effort is moving ahead like a freight train.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Maxine Waters, a California Democrat who whispered ``no''
each time the roll was called, read from a statement that began
with the explanation that she was ``of sound mind, excellent health
and a clear conscience.'' She went on, directing her remarks to her
grandchildren, mother and siblings ``living and dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Waters asked that history note that she fought against
impeachment. ``Let history treat me kindly,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. William Delahunt, D-Mass., called the move toward
impeachment ``a capital case'' against Clinton. ``This case
involves the death penalty, politically speaking, for the executive
branch of government,'' Delahunt said.

PARTISAN PANEL VOTES TO IMPEACH CLINTON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A sharply divided, highly partisan House Judiciary
Committee on Friday recommended removing President Clinton from
office, setting up a momentous impeachment vote next week by the
House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   The committee approved three articles of impeachment, two of
them accusing Clinton of lying under oath and another saying he
obstructed justice in an effort to conceal his affair with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth article, which alleges that Clinton misused his office
in an attempt to cover-up his affair, was scheduled for debate by
the Republican-controlled committee early Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The first article was approved as dusk fell on the nation's
capital and less than 10 minutes after Clinton made an
extraordinary, nationally televised plea from the White House for a
punishment less than impeachment, which would lead to a Senate
trial that could end his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never should have misled the country, the Congress, my
friends or my family. Quite simply, I gave into my shame,'' Clinton
said, adding that his fate is in the hands of the public and the
Congress. ``Should they determine that my errors of word and deeds
require their rebuke and censure, I am ready to accept that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's critics, many of them at the forefront of the effort
to drive him from office, were unmoved, and moments later he became
only the third president in U.S. history to be accused by the
Judiciary Committee of an impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He couldn't even admit what his attorneys have admitted for
him, that he misled the court,'' said Rep. Bob Barr, a Georgia
Republican who 13 months ago, before the Lewinsky affair became
public, called for Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steve Chabot, an Ohio Republican on the committee, said the
president's effort to woo undecided House members fell short. ``I
don't think this is going to get him off the hook at this late
date,'' Chabot said. ``It's not going to make a significant
difference to any members sitting on the fence.''
</P>
<P>
   When advance word of Clinton's latest mea culpa was whispered to
Judiciary Committee members, most of them hustled out of the
oak-panelled Room 2141 of the Rayburn Office Building and huddled
around television sets to watch the president.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, the committee members shuffled back to their
seats in the room where, 24 years earlier, articles of impeachment
were approved to remove President Nixon for his role in the
Watergate scandal. Faced with a certain impeachment vote by the
full House and no support in the Senate, Nixon resigned a week
later.
</P>
<P>
   Much as their predecessors almost a quarter-century ago,
Judiciary Committee members Friday stared straight ahead, most with
no expression, as they responded joylessly when their names were
called by Shawn Friesen, the committee clerk two years out of
college.
</P>
<P>
   The audience sat quietly, reporters scribbled notes and
television cameras panned the committee room as each of the
Republicans responded ``aye'' and the Democrats called out ``no''
as the roll was called.
</P>
<P>
   Friesen counted the votes, then reported: ``Mr. Chairman, there
are 21 aye, 16 nay.''
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., looked around the room
and asked: ``Have all voted who wish to?'' There was no response.
The Illinois Republican rapped his gavel on the dais and called
out: ``Then Article 1 is agreed to.''
</P>
<P>
   The clock read 4:25 p.m. EST, and Clinton had been formally
accused by the committee of lying to a federal grand jury. The
charge stems from his Aug. 17 testimony before the panel, which was
being used by independent counsel Kenneth Starr to investigate the
president's affair with Lewinsky and attempt to keep it secret.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later, the committee voted again, and Article 2 was
approved. It accuses Clinton of lying during his Jan. 17 sworn
testimony in the Paula Jones lawsuit. The article of impeachment
was approved 20-17. Rep. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina
Republican who long has opposed impeachment for lying in a civil
lawsuit, had sided with the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   After another three hours of rancorous debate, the committee
approved Article 3 accusing Clinton of obstruction of justice by
allegedly interfering in the Jones lawsuit on several different
occasions. The vote was 21-16, again with all Republicans voting to
impeach and the Democrats voting against.
</P>
<P>
   Article 4, which the committee is scheduled to consider
Saturday, would accuse Clinton of abusing the power of his office
by making false statements to aides, his Cabinet and to the public.
The article also accuses him of misusing his executive privilege in
an effort to keep aides from cooperating with Starr's
investigation. Clinton also is accused in this article of making
false statements in response to inquiries from the Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Chabot said his vote to push for Clinton's removal was made
easier by his behavior. The president ``lied so many times in so
many forums it's really hard to keep track of it all,'' Chabot
said. ``For the children of this nation, this president has to be
impeached.''
</P>
<P>
   By passing the articles, the committee assured that the House _
for only the second time in U.S. history _ will vote on whether to
impeach the president. House members have been alerted by Speaker
Newt Gingrich to return to Washington by midweek to consider

could lead to removal from office. Johnson's trial in 1868 ended
with his acquittal, and he continued as president until leaving
office in 1869.

 &HT;    3 impeachment articles OK'd, go to the House
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman, Ken Foskett and Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Unswayed by another presidential plea for
forgiveness, the House Judiciary Committee recommended Friday that
President Clinton be removed from office for lying under oath and
obstructing justice.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appeared in the White House Rose Garden in a last-ditch
attempt to stave off impeachment through a public display of
penitence, saying he would accept ``rebuke and censure'' from the
Congress for his misconduct in the Monica Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, at 4:26 p.m., he became the third president to be
charged with an impeachable offense. Somber committee members voted
an article of impeachment charging that he committed perjury in his
Aug. 17 testimony to a federal grand jury investigating his
relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-16 vote, like most of the committee's work on
impeachment, was split strictly on party lines.
</P>
<P>
   Later Friday, the committee adopted two additional articles of
impeachment. Article 2, accusing Clinton of perjury in his
testimony in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit, won
committee approval by a 20-17 vote. Rep. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.)
joined the Democrats in opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The third article, passed by a 21-16 party-line vote, charged
that the president obstructed justice in the Jones case and the
grand jury investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The committee will return today to its stately hearing room,
also the scene of impeachment proceedings against President Nixon
24 years ago. The panel will vote on a fourth article accusing
Clinton of abusing the powers of his office.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also will present a proposed resolution of censure,
which the Republican majority is certain to defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The House will meet Thursday to debate the impeachment articles,
according to Speaker Newt Gingrich, who is playing virtually no
role in the impeachment in his final weeks as speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Livingston (R-La.), Gingrich's presumptive
successor, is waiting for the committee to complete its work before
making a decision about allowing a vote on censure, spokesman Mark
Corallo said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans were acutely aware of the gravity of
their proceedings Friday. They harked back frequently to the
proceedings against Nixon and, less often, to the impeachment of
Andrew Johnson, who was impeached in 1868 but survived his trial in
the Senate by one vote.
</P>
<P>
   While Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.) called Friday's first votes
``historic,'' few Republicans appeared to find much joy in their
role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am mindful that there are many qualities of Bill Clinton
that I admire, and of even greater significance, that the many
people of my state admire,'' said Rep. Asa Hutchinson (R-Ark.), who
hails from Clinton's home state of Arkansas. ``This is not a
pleasant experience for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steve Chabot (R-Ohio) said, ``He lied so many times in so
many forums it's really hard to keep track of it all. For the
children of this nation, this president has to be impeached.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, on the other hand, expressed incredulity that
Clinton's sexual indiscretions would subject him to impeachment.
They complained bitterly that Republicans were accusing Clinton of
perjury without specifying exactly which statements amounted to
perjury.
</P>
<P>
   They insisted in vain that he could not be accused of perjury in
the Jones lawsuit because his statements were not material, meaning
they had nothing to do with the substance of Jones' allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides tried to place the proceedings in context. Judiciary
Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, an Illinois Republican, countered
Democratic criticisms that impeachment would overturn the results
of the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not reversing any election. Bob Dole will not end up
president of the United States if there is an impeachment,'' Hyde
said. ``We are following a process wisely set down as a check and
balance on executive overreaching, by our Founding Fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, who was the last to give his opening remarks before the
committee began debating the articles of impeachment, sought to
crystalize the issues before the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lying under oath ``cheapens the oath. It is a breach
of promise to tell the truth. It subverts our system of
government.''
</P>
<P>
   He summarized the Democrats' position as the ``so what''
defense, accusing the minority of overlooking the seriousness of
the president's actions.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Howard Berman, a California Democrat, said he believes the
president lied under oath, even if Clinton has yet to say so.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Berman said, ``I don't believe this constitutes or rises
to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans argued that the House is not voting to convict the
president, but merely to send the matter to the Senate, akin to the
proceedings of a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming Clinton is impeached, the prospects for his conviction
by the Senate appear remote. It takes two-thirds of the Senate, or
67 senators, to remove the president from office. Republicans hold
55 seats to 45 for the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) said the likelihood of Clinton's
acquittal in a Senate trial demonstrates that ``the Republicans are
using impeachment to censure the president because they know the
Senate won't vote him out.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barr, exulting in the adoption of three articles late
Friday, said, ``The dynamics can change very quickly. When I first
brought this up a year ago, people said my chances for impeachment
were ... one in 9 million. Now look.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's last-minute apology, which stopped short of
conceding he lied under oath, failed to change any minds on the
committee, even among Republican members who said they were open to
anything new the president might have to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking ...for an admission that he violated the oath,''
Graham said. ``That did not happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it's a sincere apology, but it's not going to change my
view,'' said Ed Bryant (R-Tenn.).
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, (R-Texas), a strong Clinton
critic, was far less charitable, calling the speech ``an insult to
...the intelligence of all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision to make yet another public show of
contrition, this one before his trip to the Middle East, reflected
a growing sense in Washington that he may well suffer the
humiliation of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Six previously undeclared Republicans, including Georgia
Republican Saxby Chambliss, announced their support for impeachment
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.), one of a handful of Republicans who
have said they will oppose impeachment, called Clinton's statement
a step in the right direction, but said he would need to do more to
attract uncommitted, mainly moderate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Rep. Charles Schumer of New York warned that the
momentum had swung in favor of impeachment in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that will stop impeachment is a strong reaction
from the American people,'' Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats held out some hope of defeating the fourth article of
impeachment, the one alleging that Clinton abused his powers by
lying to his aides and asserting executive privilege for frivolous
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ed Pease(R-Ind.) who voted for the three articles,
expressed reservations about some of the other charges against
Clinton. ``Having reviewed and reviewed the material, I do not
believe that all of the allegations presented meet the standard of
being proven by 'clear and convincing evidence,''' Pease said.

WILLIAMS EXPECTED TO CHALLENGE HEISMAN RECORD FOR VICTORY MARGIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ What the 64th Heisman Trophy presentation
lacks in drama, it could compensate with history.
</P>
<P>
   Texas senior running back Ricky Williams is the shoo-in favorite
to become the winner of college football's most prestigious award
in ceremonies tonight (6:30 p.m., ESPN) at New York's Downtown
Athletic Club.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who in his last game became NCAA Division I-A's most
prolific ground gainer, could break another record _ biggest
landslide by a Heisman winner. In 1968, Southern California running
back O.J. Simpson won the Heisman by 1,750 points, the largest
margin in the award's history.
</P>
<P>
   There are 920 Heisman voters _ media members plus all living
former winners. The media ballots are divided among six regions
(Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, Far West, Southwest and South),
with 145 media voters in each region.
</P>
<P>
   The voters each list three players; first place is worth three
points, second worth two points and third is worth one.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I win, I think it would be a great end to my career,''
Williams said yesterday during a news conference in New York. ``I
think the thing that excites me the most about winning an award
like this is the fact that people are giving me credit for having
an impact on my team.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams could have applied for the NFL draft after last season,
but he returned for his senior season. He said he returned so he
could ``have fun and play football.'' He did that and more.
Williams rushed for 2,124 yards and led Texas to an 8-3 record and
a berth in the Cotton Bowl on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to possibly making history, Williams will be bucking
a recent trend if he wins the Heisman. Preseason favorites
typically don't wind up with the trophy. That happened last year
when Tennessee quarterback Peyton Manning lost to Michigan's
Charles Woodson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult for the front-runner to make it because
there are so many people that question it every day,'' Texas coach
Mack Brown said. ``The pressure is just so tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin and the UT campus became awash in Williams T-shirts and
bumper stickers. A song was written about him. And every day at
practice, a billboard on Interstate 35 loomed. It said ``Run,
Ricky, Run'' and kept a running countdown of his pursuit of Tony
Dorsett's career rushing record.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of pressure about the Heisman at first,'' said
Williams, who set 16 NCAA and 40 school records in his four-year
career. ``Everyone was looking at you and every team was trying to
stop you. But as the season went on, I didn't think about it as
much. I just went out and played hard.''
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of evidence to safely assume Williams' Heisman
victory:
</P>
<P>
   A weekly poll of 10 Heisman voters conducted by the ``Rocky
Mountain News'' has Williams as the unanimous winner. Just 10
voters of 921, you say? This survey has picked the Heisman winner
each of the last 10 years _ including last season, when Woodson was
the surprise pick over Manning.
</P>
<P>
   Williams has won the Maxwell and Walter Camp awards that are
given each year to college football's top player. Seven of the past
10 years, the winner of the Maxwell has won the Heisman. Nine of
the past 10 years, the winner of the Walter Camp has won the
Heisman.
</P>
<P>
   The other finalists are quarterbacks _ UCLA's Cade McNown,
Kansas State's Michael Bishop and Kentucky's Tim Couch. The Heisman
has been won by a running back 37 times; quarterbacks have won it
18 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be a tremendous injustice if Ricky Williams
doesn't win it,'' Texas A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's certainly deserving of the award,'' said Nebraska coach
Frank Solich, who recruited Mike Rozier, the 1983 Heisman winner.
Williams is ``a great, great football player. I'd be surprised if
he doesn't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Williams' competitors for the award are readying concession
speeches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's pretty much over,'' said Couch, the only junior
among the finalists. ``I think they're going to give it to Williams
because he got the record, had a great year and a great career. I'm
just going to go enjoy it. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
to go meet these guys, go see New York and the Downtown Athletic
Club and have a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   And, perhaps, become a witness to history.

TOP PITCHER MIGHT PICK TEAM TODAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ The one big prize left from the free-agent
market could be awarded today at baseball's winter meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Agent Scott Boras said yesterday that pitcher Kevin Brown is
close to making a decision on where he'll pitch next year.
Major-league officials said the Baltimore Orioles and Los Angeles
Dodgers appear to be the favorites, but Boras said none of the
teams that have shown interest have been eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego Padres, St. Louis Cardinals, Anaheim Angels and
Colorado Rockies are also pursuing Brown, who was 18-7 with a 2.38
earned-run average for the Padres this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers and the Orioles are considered the favorites mainly
because they have the financial resources to meet Brown's contract
demands, and they have shown the ability to be competitive every
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin Brown is a very special player in a very special market
for premium pitchers,'' Boras said. ``The desire for his services
is not surprising. Everybody knows the value of a No. 1 pitcher.
The premium is Kevin is a pitcher who has taken two good teams
\RFlorida and San Diego\S and put them in the World Series the past
two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Boras said Brown will definitely receive a six-year contract,
and a seventh guaranteed year is a possibility. That would likely
eliminate the Rockies and Padres, who have said they're not willing
to go that far.
</P>
<P>
   Boras refused to say if Brown would walk away from the
negotiations as the highest-paid player in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Angels first baseman Mo Vaughn enjoys that status with a
six-year, $80 million contract that averages $13.3 million per
season. Mets catcher Mike Piazza received the highest total package
when he agreed to a seven-year, $91 million deal in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of numbers floating around out there,'' Boras
said. ``We're talking about both the structure of the deal and the
length of the deal and also trying to get a solid definition of the
club's commitment to continue to bring in teammates that would
allow them to be competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Boras said he met with all six teams yesterday and has more
meetings scheduled today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had enough communications from teams where we're close
to a decision,'' Boras said.

EDITORIAL: GOVERNOR PATAKI'S WISE CHOICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Dec. 12:
</P>
<P>
   The choice of a judge for the state's highest court is among the
most important decisions a governor makes. This week Gov. George
Pataki chose well, nominating Albert Rosenblatt, a widely respected
New York state Appellate Division judge to a seat on the state's
Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's harsh attacks on the court during his first term for
decisions he viewed as too sympathetic to the rights of criminal
defendants raised concern he would appoint blindly pro-prosecution
judges. But in selecting Rosenblatt as his second appointment to
the seven-member bench, Pataki opted for a moderate whose
background includes stints as a Dutchess County prosecutor and as
the state's chief administrative judge.
</P>
<P>
   Though more conservative than Justice Vito Titone, the fierce
defender of civil liberties he is to replace, Rosenblatt has
produced a string of well-written opinions that suggest a
thoughtful approach not captive to any rigid ideology. Rosenblatt's
imposition of the death penalty in 1983 under provisions of the
state's old capital punishment statute no doubt helped him gain
favor with Pataki, an ardent death penalty supporter. But the
judge's regrettable ruling in that case does not necessarily
foretell how he will vote 15 years later on issues concerning the
state's new death penalty law or other criminal justice matters.
</P>
<P>
   While Titone's principled voice will be missed, the selection of
Rosenblatt adds a fair and capable jurist to a court that decides
the vast majority of its cases by unanimous decisions.

`JEWS AND JESUS' AND `DELPHI OR BUST': A DOLLOP OF JUDAISM, A BIT
OF LEGEND 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(lb) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On West 42nd Street, imaginary Greek gods and
goddesses with names like Candora, Pectorus and Hernia are dancing
and singing. In the East Village, conflicted young Jewish men named
Steve and Nick are dancing, singing and praying that they can
resolve their relationships with two non-Jewish women.
</P>
<P>
   Visits to the two shows in which these characters appear _
``Delphi or Bust'' and ``Jews and Jesus'' _ give very different
impressions of the current state of the original off-Broadway
musical.
</P>
<P>
   The lamentable ``Delphi or Bust'' supports the contention that
New York is filled with seriously talented performers who will do
virtually anything to get on a stage, and that all the talented
writers must be growing up and moving somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   The lovable ``Jews and Jesus'' is a reminder that terrific
original work _ by composers, lyricists and performers alike _
often comes from a strong point of view and a willingness to take
chances.
</P>
<P>
   Take one of the early scenes in ``Jews and Jesus,'' in which
Steve (Kevin Merritt) meets a young woman on a bus, headed for a
singles weekend in the Catskills. She asks what he does for a
living.
</P>
<P>
   ``Real estate,'' says Steve.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you work for your father,'' she replies.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he says. He takes a pause. ``We work together.'' And
another pause. ``For his father.''
</P>
<P>
   Merritt has great timing. So do the show's director, Anthony
Patellis, Sean Power (who plays Nick, a rabbinical student living
in Israel and struggling against the temptation of premarital sex)
and just about everybody connected with this production.
</P>
<P>
   Teddy Coluca and Mary Ann Conk, in multiple ``older person''
roles, are great. But then Oren Safdie, who wrote ``Jews and
Jesus,'' and Ronnie Cohen, who wrote the music and lyrics, have
given the cast a lot of great irreverent material to work with.
</P>
<P>
   The important word here is ``irreverent.'' ``Jews and Jesus'' is
no serious examination of Jewish-Christian intermarriage or of
religious beliefs. Several of the characters, in fact, are
practically atheists. ``It has nothing to do with God,'' Steve says
of his Jewishness. ``It's tribal.''
</P>
<P>
   The show poses musical questions like ``The Messiah: Would he
eat a ham and cheese?'' and refers to King David's ``rolls in the
hay.'' It challenges the belief that tradition can be recaptured
``by wearing a black suit in a desert.'' It even has the nerve to
question Israel's safety as a vacation destination (including the
lyric ``Come to Israel: You'd better say your prayers'').
</P>
<P>
   ``Delphi or Bust,'' on the other hand, has nothing to challenge.
It has an impressive cast with strong voices and lots of energy,
but they're saddled with a silly plot and decidedly lame humor. The
show is entirely in rhyme, much of it simple-minded. One character,
poisoned, says: ``I have such cramps. You tramps.'' Another
example: ``You pass. Fair lass.''
</P>
<P>
   The story is about three women who are candidates for the job of
the new oracle at Delphi. They are Candora (Tia Riebling), who
seems to be dressed as a chicken, perhaps because her mother was
seduced by Zeus when he was disguised as an owl; Nebula (Jill
Geddes), who looks strangely like a leprechaun, and Zircony
(Colleen Hawks), a Jayne Mansfield look-alike whose only real
talent seems to be screaming.
</P>
<P>
   John Simeone as Asphodel (Narcissus' more self-involved brother)
manages to overcome the script and make his constant mirror-gazing
entertaining. And Darren Lee Frazier as Cy the Cyclops turns ``Even
if I'm Not Your Type'' into the only moving song in the production.
(Other numbers include ``We Greeks Have a Myth for It All'' and
``Fate Can Be Funny.'') But then all the cast members may have
noteworthy performances in them; they just aren't going to happen
in this show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jews and Jesus'' continues at La Mama E.T.C. through Dec. 23.
``Delphi or Bust'' continues at the Theater Row Theater, Wednesdays
through Sundays, through Dec. 20.

GATTI AND ROBINSON TO TAKE TOP BILLING IN REMATCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is not often that a world championship fight does not get top
billing on a card, but convention is tossed out when Arturo Gatti
fights.
</P>
<P>
   So, when Fernando Vargas challenges Yory Boy Campas for his
International Boxing Federation junior middleweight championship at
Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City Saturday night, it will take
second billing to Gatti's rematch against Ivan Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who saw the first Gatti-Robinson bout on Aug. 22 _ a
10-round split decision by Robinson _ would understand. No one
understands more than the programmers at HBO, which will broadcast
the bouts as part of its ``Championship Boxing'' series beginning
at 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Gatti is a human highlight reel. One second he is out on his
feet. The next second he is knocking out his opponent. Because of
his great television appeal, Gatti may be the only boxer other than
Mike Tyson who can be 0-2 in his last two bouts and headline a
boxing show.
</P>
<P>
   Another loss will put Gatti (29-3), who weighed in at 135
pounds, further from the lightweight championship picture and
jeopardize his television clout. Another victory by Robinson (26-2)
will plant him firmly in the championship field.
</P>
<P>
   Gatti calls this the most important fight of his career. He said
he had taken his training very seriously, moving his camp from
Virginia Beach, Va., to Vero Beach, Fla., to avoid all the
temptations _ late night partying _ that had plagued his training
in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Gatti, of Jersey City, promises a different performance this
time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the fight I was supposed to fight back in
August,'' he said. ``This fight will wash away that performance in
August.''
</P>
<P>
   Gatti said he was not in top physical condition for that fight.
He said he knew it from the first round on, after he had thrown
several punches. ``Because I was out of shape, he was on my level
with me being out of shape,'' Gatti said.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, of Philadelphia, who weighed in at 133} pounds, said
that was nonsense. It does appear implausible, considering that
Gatti was strong enough to trade a significant number of punches
with Robinson over 10 rounds, knocking Robinson down in the fifth
and nearly knocking Robinson out in the 10th round.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said he was not looking to repeat the performance from
the first fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be better than the first fight,'' Robinson said.
``It's going to be a lot of action. He's going to make me fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said the first three rounds would be crucial, because
he thought Gatti would try to take him out early. In the last fight
Robinson could sense that Gatti kept waiting for him to make a
mistake, but Robinson did not until the fifth round, when Gatti
caught him. But by that time, Gatti did not have enough sting on
his punches to take Robinson out.
</P>
<P>
   The Campas-Vargas bout is compelling, because Vargas (14-0) is
giving away a great deal of experience to Campas (72-2). Many
people believe Vargas is in over his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's from people who don't know boxing and know that styles
make fights,'' Vargas said. ``Yory Boy Campas is tailor-made for
me. He's a straight-ahead brawler. He'll take 100 punches to give
one. I feel very confident about this fight. I've been training
very hard. I've sparred 131 rounds getting ready for this fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Both fighters weighed in at 151 pounds.

NEW YORK BARS PUBLIC LIBRARY FEES 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By JOHN T. McQUISTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York State Board of Regents Friday barred
local public libraries from charging people from neighboring
communities for library cards.
</P>
<P>
   The move is meant to help the 1.3 million New Yorkers who live
in towns or rural areas without a public library and must pay fees
to take out books in a library in a nearby town.
</P>
<P>
   The board, which charters public libraries, banned such fees by
approving an amendment to the state's 50-year-old public library
system regulations. The new rules will go into effect Jan. 29.
</P>
<P>
   The Regents will, however, allow libraries to limit use by
residents of neighboring communities who pay little or no taxes to
support library services, said Janet Welch, the state librarian.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, a library might limit borrowing in popular areas
like best sellers, videos and books on tape,'' she said. ``But it
cannot charge individuals for cards. Libraries must continue to
provide free access to the educational and informational resources
New Yorkers need.''
</P>
<P>
   The Regents chancellor, Carl Hayden, said that allowing
libraries to limit their services was an interim measure to help
them cope with the financial burden of accommodating nonresidents
who will no longer pay fees for cards. He said a recently appointed
Regents commission has taken up the issue and will propose
solutions by June 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to ensure the broadest access to information for all,
not just those who can afford to buy a library card,'' Hayden said.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a 1997 survey, the State Education Department estimated
that 90 percent of libraries were providing nonresidents with free
library cards. Most of the 10 percent that charged fees were on
Long Island, with others scattered throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   The state is divided into 23 public library systems. The new
rules will require each system to include in its service plan a
provision guaranteeing free use of its libraries to people residing
within its boundaries. And in order for the system to continue to
receive state aid, the State Education Department must approve the
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Geddes, acting director of the Nassau County Library
System, which receives $3 million annually from the state, said
Friday that he was already working with the state on the problem.
Many of the 54 libraries in the Nassau system have been charging
nonresidents fees ranging from $25 to $300.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules will have little impact on such libraries as the
Bayville Free Library, which serves only one out-of-town resident,
from neighboring Mill Neck. Others, however, will be hard hit.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the public library in Valley Stream, in Nassau
County on the Queens border, serves several hundred nonresidents
who this year paid fees that contributed $20,000 to the library's
$860,000 budget. The director of the library, Marshal Botwinick,
said he expected the loss of the income would be a harsh blow.

NRC CHAIRWOMAN NAMED PRESIDENT OF RENSSELAER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Mass., N.J.)  (rl) 
 By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shirley Jackson, a physicist who is the chairwoman of the
federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission, was named Friday as
president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   As head of the NRC, Jackson worked to restore the agency's
credibility and improve its monitoring of nuclear-power plants in
the aftermath of several emergency shutdowns.
</P>
<P>
   She will move to the school on July 1, succeeding R. Byron
Pipes, who left office in April. Neal Barton has been serving as
acting president of the 6,400-student university.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, 52, will be the first African-American woman to head a
leading technological university. All her life she has set
precedents. She was the first black woman to earn a Ph.D. at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology; in 1973, she was also the
first to become an NRC commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson describes herself as a ``change agent.'' As an
undergraduate at MIT, for example, she was a founder of the Black
Students Association, and helped increase the number of African
Americans entering the university to 57 from two in just one year.
</P>
<P>
   MIT President Charles Vest said Jackson had been one of his
close advisers. ``That calm, reasoned voice on the other end of the
telephone has been a source of strength and wisdom for me,'' he
said. ``She will be a truly outstanding university president.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson joined the NRC, an agency with about 3,000 employees and
a budget of $500 million, in 1995, shortly before it acknowledged
ignoring its own safety regulations in overseeing Northeast
Utilities' Millstone nuclear station in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``To her credit, she's helped to re-legitimize the agency,''
said James Riccio, a staff attorney at Public Citizen, an advocacy
organization. ``Unfortunately, it seems she is leaving before that
mission is accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   In her new post, Jackson said, she hopes ``to position
Rensselaer not only as an excellent university, but as one of the
truly great technological institutes of the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   Although most of her career has been spent in the private sector
_ she worked for many years as a researcher at Bell Laboratories _
she taught from 1991 to 1995 at Rutgers University and has served
as a trustee of both Rutgers and MIT, where she was also on the
board of directors and the board's executive committee.
</P>
<P>
   Before entering government, Jackson was also on the boards of
Corestates Financial Corp., the Sealed Air Corp., the New Jersey
Resources Corp. and the Public Service Electric and Gas Company and
its parent company, Public Service Enterprise Group.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson grew up in Washington, D.C. Her father was a postal
supervisor, and her mother was a social worker. At a time when it
was unusual for women to receive advanced degrees, she and her two
sisters earned graduate degrees.

GAS EXPLOSION KILLS AT LEAST FOUR IN MINNESOTA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ANDREW BLUTH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. CLOUD, Minn. _ A natural-gas pipeline exploded in the middle
of downtown shortly before noon Friday, killing four people,
injuring 14 others and leveling three buildings in a one-block
area.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the blast, which blew out windows several blocks
away and could be felt up to five miles away created a dust cloud
that covered the entire downtown area and hurled debris up to three
blocks.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said a construction crew laying fiber-optic
cable accidentally ruptured the line, releasing gas into the air.
Firefighters and investigators from Northern States Power Co. were
on the scene warning people of the leak and evacuating the area
when the explosion was sparked. The cause of the spark was unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the dead were employees of the power company who were
investigating the leak. The other two were not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Michael Holman of the St. Cloud fire department said all
potential victims had been accounted for, and he said crews would
work through the night, with the help of search dogs, heavy
equipment and dozens of volunteers to clear the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   He said 14 people were treated at the hospital, including two
firefighters and four victims who were rescued from the rubble. One
woman was in critical condition undergoing surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``This area can be pretty busy during lunchtime,'' Holman said.
``We're very lucky this didn't happen even a half-hour later.''
</P>
<P>
   The blast occurred in the Courthouse Square section of the city,
the central part of downtown. A bar, a restaurant and a two-story
building containing a law office and apartments were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Murray was delivering beer to Bookem's, the bar that was
destroyed, when the explosion occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was standing in the bar making my delivery when I felt this
enormous push of air,'' he said. ``The next thing I knew I was
outside the bar. It was like a movie, everything happening in slow
motion and debris flying everywhere. The dust was so thick I
couldn't see a foot in front of me.''
</P>
<P>
   The blast occurred just one block from the headquarters of the
fire and police departments, and Murray said authorities were
immediately on the scene to help victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went back inside the bar to find the owner, and by the time
I located him and came back out, police were giving first aid and
evacuating people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities shut off power and gas to the area immediately
and evacuated a six-block area that included an elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Len Smallwood of the St. Cloud police department, who felt
the windows shake in his office a block away, said he and other
officers ran outside to assist after hearing the blast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We headed out the doors and there was debris just floating in
the air and this huge dust cloud,'' he said, likening the scene to
his experience at war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't see anything like it except for Vietnam,'' Smallwood
said. ``It made me want to take cover.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After clearing the rest of the wreckage to ensure that no
victims were trapped, the authorities said they would begin
investigating what ignited the explosion. Fire officials as well as
investigators from the Minnesota Office of Pipeline Safety were
sent to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Arne Carlson traveled Friday to St. Cloud, a city of about
58,000 people, 75 miles northwest of Minneapolis. He promised state
emergency money to help pay for the cleanup and emergency services.

   NEW YORK _ State Attorney General Dennis Vacco is coming under
increasing criticism from fellow Republicans as he continues his
fight over last month's election, and some are openly suggesting
that it is time for him to concede _ though he still has Staten
Island Borough President Guy Molinari in his corner _ and to
acknowledge his Democratic rival, Eliot Spitzer, as the next
attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Unofficial returns show Spitzer with a seemingly insurmountable
lead of 26,000 votes over Vacco. But the Republican incumbent has
refused to concede. His campaign has maintained, among other
things, that tens of thousands of New York City voters cast ballots
illegally, and the campaign has filed lawsuits in state Supreme
Court asking that Vacco be named the winner or that the court
authorize a new election.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco's efforts have drawn sharp condemnation from Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But a growing number of Republican leaders, privately and
publicly, have started to complain that they consider Vacco's
approach to be excessive and that he is harming the image of the
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has gone on too long,'' state Sen. Michael Balboni, a
Republican of Mineola, said Friday. ``There are legitimate concerns
about voter eligibility in any large municipality, and about
rooting out any fraud. But, at this point, to go to this length is
troubling.''
</P>
<P>
   Balboni said that he considered Vacco to be ``a terrific
attorney general,'' but that ``the voters have said differently; he
should move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Several days ago, Gov. George Pataki, also a Republican,
distanced himself from an effort by the Vacco campaign to use New
York City police officers to conduct door-to-door investigations of
more than 103,000 homes in largely minority neighborhoods to
determine the eligibility of people whom the campaign suspected of
having voted fraudulently.
</P>
<P>
   And Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, another Republican, said he would
not order police participation without a court order, and a state
Supreme Court judge insisted that none was forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   The state's Board of Elections is scheduled to certify the
election results Tuesday. Monday, one day before the results are to
be certified, representatives of the two campaigns must return to
the state Supreme Court in Albany, and Vacco will be asked to
substantiate his charges of widespread voter fraud in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco's lawyers have contended that he has no plans to concede
and have hinted that the Republican incumbent may pursue further
legal action if Spitzer is certified by the Board of Elections as
the winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason for him to concede,'' said Molinari, a
Republican. ``No candidate in his right mind should abandon a legal
remedy because some people in the party think he should.''
</P>
<P>
   An upstate Republican mayor, Roy Bernardi of Syracuse, said he
understood how the closeness of the margin could be a source of
frustration to Vacco. ``But I think we need to move on and certify
the election,'' Bernardi said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the Vacco campaign's pursuit of police officers to
investigate claims of voter fraud would have a detrimental effect
on the image of Republicans in black and Hispanic communities,
where Spitzer's lead was widest and where much of the investigation
would have been concentrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have evidence that irregularities are occurring, you
should check the entire system, not just certain neighborhoods,''
Bernardi said. ``The Republican Party needs to reach out more to
the Latino and African-American communities. And this is not
exactly a way to endear the party to those communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Vacco's lawyers obtained an order from the state
Supreme Court to keep the offices of the New York City Board of
Elections open Saturday, to enable the campaign's lawyers and
volunteers to examine voter information in an effort to determine
whether voters had cast ballots illegally.

ATTORNEY GENERAL'S LAWYER HAS FOUGHT MANY BATTLES

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Thomas Spargo, the lawyer representing Dennis Vacco,
a Republican, in his struggle to remain state attorney general, has
sometimes done battle with the very party that enlisted him in this
cause.
</P>
<P>
   Among the political figures who have retained Spargo, an expert
on election law, are Ross Perot, the independent presidential
candidate; Jerry Brown, the former governor of California and
sometime presidential contender; Karen Burstein, the Democrat who
ran against Vacco four years ago, and Thomas Golisano, the
Independence Party candidate for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Only two years ago, Spargo succeeded in getting Steve Forbes a
spot on the New York state presidential primary ballot despite
strenuous opposition from supporters of Bob Dole, including Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   Until a decade ago, Spargo, now 55, was known as a Republican
loyalist. For 15 years, he was counsel to the Republican State
Committee. That chapter in his life ended after he became a target
of a state commission that was investigating whether he helped
channel nearly $800,000 from a shopping-center developer, Pyramid
Co. of Syracuse, to candidates for the Poughkeepsie Town Board.
</P>
<P>
   From 1985 to 1989, Spargo sought to block the investigation by
filing a series of 16 lawsuits, said Peter Bienstock, who was the
executive director of the New York State Commission on Government
Integrity. Spargo agreed to testify before the commission only
after a judge ordered him arrested for contempt of court.
</P>
<P>
   He was never charged with criminal wrongdoing, but the
investigation eventually forced him to give up the party position
and a second job as counsel to the State Senate Election Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became embarrassing for me and for the party to have its
counsel under this kind of attack,'' Spargo recalled. He said that
the commission took aim at him because of his long service to the
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Spargo has been in the news because of Vacco's
continuing effort to challenge the results of the state attorney
general's race. Unofficial results placed Vacco more than 26,000
votes behind his Democratic rival, Eliot Spitzer, but in his latest
legal maneuver, the incumbent attorney general has maintained that
tens of thousands of votes in New York City were fraudulently cast.
</P>
<P>
   Bienstock said that Spargo's tactics in the Vacco case _ keeping
the case going with one legal challenge after another _ mirrored
the strategy he used more than a decade ago in the Poughkeepsie
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He advanced theory after theory after theory,'' Bienstock
said. ``He lost most of the litigation, but it all took time. He
knew that we had a finite life.'' Spargo, however, credits his
lawyers for developing the legal strategy for him.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his reputation as a relentless litigator, Spargo is
popular with other members of the small fraternity of lawyers with
expertise in the arcane New York state election laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an adversary, he's friendly, he's soft-spoken, and you can
rely on his word,'' said state Sen. Martin Connor, D-Brooklyn, a
lawyer for the Spitzer campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Harding, the chairman of the Liberal Party, hired Spargo
to handle Ms. Burstein's petition drive when she sought the
Democratic nomination for state attorney general in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have found him over the years to be exceedingly honorable
both professionally and personally,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Born in Rome, N.Y., Spargo is a former seminarian and army
paratrooper who now lives on a farm in the Albany County community
of East Berne, where he raises pigs and turkeys with his second
wife, MaryAnn Youngs. The couple are home-schooling their two young
children, ages 6 and 7. Spargo has three grown daughters from a
previous marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Spargo's law office is about a half-mile away from the farm, in
a barnlike structure he built himself. Since election law is a
seasonal business, he also handles routine legal work like
real-estate closings and wills.
</P>
<P>
   He was not the first lawyer called to handle Vacco's
post-election efforts. Lawrence Mandelker, a New York election
specialist, headed the Republican team that monitored the recount
and the tally of paper ballots. But Mandelker has had nothing to do
with the subsequent legal challenges, prompting speculation in the
Spitzer camp that he was not happy with Vacco's decision to keep
the case going after the recount was finished.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelker, however, said that he had been retained by the
Republican State Committee for the recount only and that Spargo was
Vacco's choice. He pointed out that the judge in the case, Thomas
Keegan of the state Supreme Court, sits in Albany, not far from
Spargo's home.
</P>
<P>
   But Spargo said he thought that Mandelker had dropped out
because of a conflict in his schedule.
</P>
<P>
   He denied another rumor, also spread by Democrats, that he was
trying to get back in the good graces of the Republican Party after
incurring its animosity during the Forbes campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It was much simpler than that, he said. ``They reached out to
me,'' he said, referring to the Vacco campaign, ``and I was
available.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Car alarm a real turn-off
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Many years ago when we were house-hunting, our
real estate agent picked us up in her new car to show us some
houses. After we got into her car, we heard a robotic voice say
``Your door is ajar. Your door is ajar.''
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed, we shut the door. ``Thank you,'' came the tinny voice.
That was our first experience with ``talking cars.'' It also was
our last.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want my car to talk to me. If I have to resort to having
conversations with a vehicle, I need to check into the nearest
chapter of Get-A-Life Anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   We have been in a car-trading frenzy of late as our aging
vehicles began dying one by one. We now have newer models with
newer gadgets and fancier doodads and geegaws. I don't understand
most of them.
</P>
<P>
   And, like all right-brained people, I do not read instruction
manuals. All of which is fine when nothing goes wrong. Inevitably,
something goes wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Recently I was in the Dallas area with two of our three sons
attending yet another soccer tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Our Saturday games were at night at this lighted complex, so we
rested in our new vehicle between the 7 and 9:30 p.m. games. One
son was dozing peacefully in the back seat as I sat in the front
with my younger son, the soccer player, considering our chances of
advancing to the next day's games.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, our car's security alarm went off, screeching loudly
into the night.
</P>
<P>
   EEE-OOH, EEE-OOH, EEE-OOH.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't even know we had a security alarm. Startled, I snapped
up from my reclined position sputtering ``Wha . . . wha . . .
what?''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the sleeping son jumped up from the back seat, a
fountain of unpleasant words, but offering no help on how to turn
the thing off.
</P>
<P>
   EEE-OOH, EEE-OOH, EEE-OOH blared the alarm as I frantically
pushed buttons, pulled knobs and slid dials.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you turn this thing off?'' I barked at my children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do the opposite of whatever you did to turn it on!'' one
answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I did to turn it on,'' I shot back.
</P>
<P>
   Why is it that children always expect parents to know what to
do? Don't they know that nine times out of 10, we don't have a
clue?
</P>
<P>
   Both sons shouted suggestions to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turn the wheel!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Start the engine!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Open and shut the doors!''
</P>
<P>
   A small crowd began gathering outside our car, bemusedly
watching our frantic actions.
</P>
<P>
   In desperation, I opened the door and grabbed the first person I
saw by the coat collar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know how to turn this thing off?'' I begged.
</P>
<P>
   EEE-OOH, EEE-OOH, EEE-OOH.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's your instruction manual,'' he asked reasonably.
</P>
<P>
   ``At home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have one of those automatic locks on your keychain?''
he asked.
</P>
<P>
   I grabbed the keys from the ignition and hit the ``lock'' and
``unlock'' buttons in rapid succession. The alarm stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Silence filled the night, and the grinning onlookers began to
disperse. The boys and I looked at each other and heaved a
collective sigh of relief. I took several deep breaths, and my
heart rate gradually returned to the normal range.
</P>
<P>
   At least during the whole spectacle there hadn't been a robotic
voice informing me ``Your alarm is sounding. Your alarm is
sounding.''
</P>
<P>
   It's times like this I really long for my '67 Mustang.

GOING ON THE OFFENSIVE WITH FANCY-PASSING QBS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ When Stephenville and Carroll meet today in
a Class 4A Division II high school football semifinal, expect a
wide-open contest. At least that is the safe prediction
Stephenville coach Art Briles made on his radio show.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Briles has his own weekly radio half-hour, just like Chan
Gailey, and that isn't the only big-time feature of the Yellow
Jackets' program.
</P>
<P>
   Briles has constructed one of the most prolific offensive
attacks in Texas high school football history, with an imaginative
playbook including numerous formations and confusing variations.
And Carroll puts points on the board, too, so the meeting between
the traditional powerhouses at 5 p.m. today at Texas Stadium should
be particularly entertaining, unless your preferences lean toward
three yards and a cloud of dust.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should be one heck of a shootout,'' Carroll coach Tom
Rapp agrees.
</P>
<P>
   Stephenville (13-1) advanced last week with a 42-21 victory
against Wichita Falls Hirschi. Carroll (13-1) defeated Highland
Park, 28-21. The winner will meet the La Marque-Smithson Valley
winner next week for the 4A Division II championship.
</P>
<P>
   The Yellow Jackets' victory against Hirschi was the 11th time
this season they have scored 40 or more points in a game. Included
have been lopsided victories of 65-14 over Granbury, 63-0 over
Joshua, 58-0 over Burleson, 55-6 against Crowley and 50-6 over
Everman. Their only loss was, 40-35, to District 6-4A rival
Brownwood, which lost to Hirschi in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Stephenville is beating up on the record books, too.
</P>
<P>
   Senior quarterback Kelan Luker has thrown for 4,073 yards and 43
TDs. Luker is 403 yards away from the state single-season record of
4,476 passing yards set last year by Patrick Hutka of Class 2A
Rogers. Meanwhile, Luker's favorite target, senior end Cody
Cardwell, is logging gaudy numbers of his own. Of Cardwell's 92
receptions, 22 have been for touchdowns, and his 2,061 receiving
yards is a state record. Both are being recruited by SMU, Baylor
and Texas Tech, among other colleges.
</P>
<P>
   But the relentless Yellow Jackets aren't one-dimensional. They
come at you from every possible angle. Luker even caught a
touchdown pass this season. Almost lost in the shuffle is Zac
Hunter, but he shouldn't be. He has 1,526 yards rushing and
averages 11 yards a carry.
</P>
<P>
   ``They run every formation you can think of,'' Rapp said. ``They
must sit down and draw up offenses when they don't have anything
else to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding it all up, Stephenville's offense has gained 7,778 yards
this season _ a staggering 555 yards per game _ which is
threatening Sugar Land's all-time national record of 8,375 total
yards set in 12 games in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll still averages more yards rushing than passing, but Rapp
installed a new offense this year to take better advantage of the
arm of quarterback Nathan Chandler, who has thrown for 2,572 yards.
On the ground, Clay McNutt and runner-receiver Tye Strickland
provide a versatile one-two punch.
</P>
<P>
   McNutt has run for 1,637 yards, while Strickland has 61
receptions and combined rushing and receiving of 1,566 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough adjustment at first, because the offense was
totally new to us,'' Strickland said. ``But now that we're 15 weeks
into the season, we know it so well that when plays are called it's
almost like a reflex action.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll has reached the 50-point mark twice this year, and seven
times has reached or exceeded 40 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are two traditionally strong teams, and I don't think
either of us are where we're at by mistake,'' Stephenville's Briles
said. ``\RCarroll\S is the best offensive team we've faced this
year. I think it's going be a great game with a great atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   And what did Briles tell his radio audience?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody's going to ask for their money back,''
he said.

 &HT;    Reds pick up Braves toss-out Avery
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Cast adrift after two years in Boston, Steve
Avery returned to the National League on Friday when the Cincinnati
Reds signed the ex-Braves left-hander to a one-year contract worth
up to $1.5 million. Now he can finally wreak revenge on an Atlanta
club that once gave up on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah, I just want to take one of those guys deep. That's the
main thing,'' Avery said. ``I might start with (Tom) Glavine. Maybe
I could get all three of them, that would be cool.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds acted on the recommendation of pitching coach Don
Gullett, who has admired Avery for years. Avery was 10-7 with a
5.02 ERA last year with the Red Sox, but the club declined to pick
up his option and then refused to offer him arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Gullett) really thinks he can take Steve and bring him back
to where he was back in his early Atlanta years,'' Cincinnati
general manager Jim Bowden said. ``We think he can get back to 15
wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Since leaving the Braves after the 1996 season, he was 16-13 in
Boston and was limited to 23 starts in 1998 due to a stint in the
minors. Avery, who will turn 29 next April, is destined for the
bottom of the rotation, which currently includes six pitchers.
After ex-Brave Denny Neagle, Pete Harnish and Brett Tomko, Avery
will compete with Dennis Reyes and Jason Bere for one of the final
two spots.
</P>
<P>
   His 1999 deal includes an extra $1 million in incentives by
starting between 20 and 35 games. The contract also includes a
mutual option for the 2000 season that includes a $1 million
buyout.
</P>
<P>
   Brown signing close
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Brown may have a new team today. Agent Scott Boras met
with Los Angeles general manager Kevin Malone and Baltimore GM
Frank Wren and reported five teams still in the running _ including
San Diego, St. Louis and Colorado _ had increased their offers to
six years. At a minimum $14 million asking price per year, Brown
could fetch a $98 million contract if a team is willing to go to
seven years on a 34-year-old pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty close to making a decision possibly as soon as
(today),'' Boras said.
</P>
<P>
   Boras also said, against much rumoring early in the process,
that the Braves not only never bid but never even inquired about
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Jones moving on
</P>
<P>
   Ex-Braves batting coach Clarence Jones, displaced in the
shuffling of the staff last month, has accepted a coaching job with
the Cleveland Indians. Though offered a spot as hitting coach with
Class AAA Richmond in the Braves organization, Jones took a spot as
outfield coach with the Indians, even though he spent his playing
career as a first baseman. He may wind up a first base coach, as
manager Mike Hargrove continues to arrange his staff.
</P>
<P>
   Inquiring of Hershiser
</P>
<P>
   Though the Braves has maintained their commitment to rookie
Bruce Chen as the newcomer to the rotation next year, the team has
sent out an inquiry to Orel Hershiser, who is still unsigned after
his contract with San Francisco expired. Hershiser, 40, was 11-10
as a Giant and worked 202 innings last year but allowed 200 hits
with a 4.41 ERA.

   Joe DiMaggio, who lay near death Friday night in a Miami-area
hospital, is one of the singular figures of the 20th century
without really trying. Imagine how big he could have been with the
slightest talent for self-promotion.
</P>
<P>
   What if he'd had a flashy home run trot, traded forearm bashes
with Charlie Keller or worn his uniform socks differently from the
other Yankees? Then he might have REALLY been somebody.
</P>
<P>
   What if he'd shaved his head, tattooed his biceps or put a gold
stud in one ear? How cool would that have been? It might have been
worth millions to him. He might have gotten his own show on MTV.
</P>
<P>
   Or how about a cowboy hat and head-to-toe denim on road trips?
That would have been distinctive. They might have let him cut a
country album or plug a chewing tobacco. He'd have been a legend.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, you almost never saw DiMaggio out of a suit and tie.
Who was his fashion coordinator, anyway? Very un-hip.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't one to spit on reporters, wasn't one to brush off
autograph seekers, wasn't one to speak his mind and say the hell
with anybody who didn't like it. That was his problem; he was
always so polite, never asserted his individuality like all the
great athletes today. How'd he expect to make Page 1 that way?
Maybe self-esteem was his problem.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, he never once came into The Jungle, loosened up and
traded gloss with Jim Rome. He totally kissed off the 18-to-35
demographic. Celebrity suicide is what that was.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with DiMaggio, if you want to sum it up, is that his
marriages lasted too long. Five years with Dorothy Arnold and one
year with Marilyn Monroe. These days, anything more than the two
days of Dennis Rodman and Carmen Electra, and the gossip columnists
won't lift a pencil. And as far as we know, he never borrowed one
of Marilyn's dresses.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well, missed opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Guess he didn't want it badly enough. &QL; 
 &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Which is the point about Joe DiMaggio, isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   He didn't want it badly at all. He never enjoyed his celebrity
as much as the rest of us enjoyed his celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   And that, as we begin to look back, is what lifted the Hall of
Famer known mostly as ``The Yankee Clipper'' but sometimes as ``the
Big Guy'' above all the bad boys and poster boys of the sports
world.
</P>
<P>
   There were ``Mr. Coffee'' commercials and savings-and-loan
commercials and other TV appearances, small movie roles, a couple
of co-written books in the 1940s, golf-tournament and baseball
card-show appearances, and the annual first-ball tosses at Yankee
Stadium. And despite all that you knew, DiMaggio would have been
just as happy if nobody ever recognized him on the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' he was quoted saying, ``I want to be left
alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, at age 84, he was in and out of a coma, fighting
pneumonia nearly two months after having a cancerous tumor removed
from his right lung.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, over the newswires crawled the written appreciations.
Most included the words ``dignity'' and ``grace,'' the DiMaggio
boilerplate. None included the words ``outrageous'' and
``controversial,'' the hallmarks of modern stardom.
</P>
<P>
   I love what Marilyn Monroe said in 1953, describing their first
date: ``He had no line at all. No jokes. He was rather shy and
reserved, but at the same time, warm and friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   I love what DiMaggio did when he was offered $2 million for an
autobiography: He said no, if it meant giving up the details of
their famous relationship.
</P>
<P>
   I love what DiMaggio said about the shyness that defined his
public behavior: ``I'm nervous if I have to make a speech in front
of 10 people.''
</P>
<P>
   He is the anti-Rodman. Thank God someone is.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lipsyte, in The New York Times, recently wrote about
interviewing DiMaggio casually at the Yankees' spring-training camp
in 1967. DiMaggio talked on and on, if only about the art of
judging fly balls. Lipsyte ``took no notes . . . barely breathed,
afraid to break the spell.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, that reminded me of my only contact with DiMaggio, when
he visited the Dodgers' camp in Vero Beach, Fla., about a decade
ago and sat down with writers in the press room.
</P>
<P>
   Memorable? You bet. Like meeting Muhammad Ali, Bill Shoemaker or
the President of the United States. Do I remember what we talked
about? No. And, a Daily News library search shows I wrote nothing
about the encounter.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio wasn't there to make headlines, so he said nothing of
news value. DiMaggio wasn't there to promote anything, least of all
himself.
</P>
<P>
   In a world of self-promoters and trendies and ``individuals,''
he stood out because he never tried to be any of those.
</P>
<P>
   Dignity and grace. It's a cliche we don't get to use often
enough.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To one set of lawmakers, the accusations against
President Clinton in the articles of impeachment were models of
coherence and sufficiently precise in detail.
</P>
<P>
   To the other, they were untenably vague word jumbles. ``You've
taken an article of impeachment,'' Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., told
his Republican colleagues, ``and made it a multiple choice test.''
</P>
<P>
   From one side of the aisle, President Clinton's actions fit
perfectly the high standard for impeachment set by the
Constitution. ``William Jefferson Clinton has thrown a gauntlet at
the feet of the Congress,'' said Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   From the other side, the charges against Clinton were so poorly
substantiated that the impeachment inquiry had descended ``almost
into the theater of the absurd,'' in the words of Rep. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   As Republicans and Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee
bickered furiously Friday, studying the same facts and phrases to
draw opposite conclusions, they often seemed not merely to be
worlds apart, but to be occupying alternate universes.
</P>
<P>
   If a cow had lumbered into the hearing room, members of one
party might have called it a horse, members of the other a pig.
</P>
<P>
   But on one somber point, there was consensus. Both Republicans
and Democrats agreed, in grave voices and freighted words, that the
decisions before them were as important as any they would ever
make, and that history would sit in judgment of what they did.
</P>
<P>
   ``This vote says something about us,'' said Rep. Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., the 74-year-old chairman of the committee. ``We vote for
our honor, which is the only thing we get to take with us to the
grave.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's hearing presented something of a paradox, colored as it
was by both an acknowledgment of the momentousness of the occasion
and by intense acrimony between Republicans and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   While members of both political parties summoned the memories of
famous leaders from George Washington and Daniel Webster to Winston
Churchill and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., they drew starkly
different inspiration from those ghosts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is a vote of conscience, and I believe it is, it is
going to come down to a Republican conscience versus a Democratic
conscience,'' said Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. ``And I don't know
how to characterize that. I don't know what that means.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would suggest that one is not better than the other. I would
suggest that there is a very unique nature about this case that we
need to look at long after this case is over. And only time will
tell who got it right.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the four-hour debate over the first article of
impeachment, charging President Clinton with lying under oath about
his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, that incited the most heated
crossfire.
</P>
<P>
   The central disagreement was somewhat technical, over whether
the first article should spell out each statement by Clinton that
Republicans believe constituted perjury.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is this, a shell game?'' Frank asked. ``I guess that's
the question _ under which pea is the impeachment? Is it under No.
1, or is it under No. 2, or maybe it's under 3 and 2, or 4 and 1,
or 2 and 3, and how are you going to defend it? I mean, I have to
say, the notion _ and I hope this doesn't go anywhere and I hope we
don't bog the country down _ but I'm almost intrigued here.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., responded:
``What I'm afraid the other side is trying to do is precisely what
they're accusing us of. The other side is trying to trivialize this
matter. And this is not a trivial matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're dealing with today is the fact that the president
of the United States engaged in a scheme, an elaborate scheme, to
lie and to get other people to lie and to hide evidence and get
other people to hide evidence in order to thwart the opportunity of
Paula Jones to bring her civil rights sexual harassment suit in
court and have it properly adjudicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., offered a theory for what she
characterized as her Republican colleagues' refusal to amend the
general language of the first article of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to get any specificity in any of these
referrals,'' Ms. Waters said, ``because the allegations are so
outrageous, so flimsy, so ridiculous, that they dare not put it in
writing, they dare not write it down, because they know that the
American people won't buy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But after today, then all those who have been shopping since
Thanksgiving, all of those who thought that this was going to go
away, all of those who thought somehow it was going to be resolved,
will know exactly what has taken place.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Republican majority on the committee passed the first
article of impeachment and debate proceeded to the second, the
divergence of opinion between Republicans and Democrats was equally
wide.
</P>
<P>
   While the first article charged Clinton with lying under oath to
a federal grand jury, the second concerned the deposition he gave
in Ms. Jones' civil lawsuit, which was initially dismissed, then
appealed and finally settled out of court.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., said Clinton's denial of sexual
relations with Ms. Lewinsky in his deposition in response to Ms.
Jones' lawsuit did not represent perjury so much as ``the reaction
of a husband and father whose conduct was about to be exposed.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., saw it as ``an act of
wrongdoing meant to deprive another American citizen of her rights
in court.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steven Rothman, D-N.J., appealed to the members of the
public to make their voices louder and clearer before it was too
late.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people must tell their representatives in
Congress if they don't think this president should be impeached,
because no reasonable burden of proving his guilt has been
established,'' Rothman said in a fiery voice. ``They must stop what
will be one of the saddest moments in American history from taking
place _ the removal of a sitting United States president on no _
with no reasonable proof.''
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the impassioned oratory were surprising moments
of levity, some of which sneaked up slyly and subtly. At one point
late into the night, when Hyde granted a request from Frank to
interrupt him, Frank said, ``I appreciate your swinging my way.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, as the familiar details of Clinton's interactions with
Ms. Lewinsky were hashed out anew, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y.,
sarcastically derided a theory put forward by some investigators
that a stuffed bear Clinton gave Ms. Lewinsky had been a signal to
stand firm against questions about their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the bear was a warning from the president that the
stock market was going to tank and she should put her money in
bonds,'' Nadler said.

   WASHINGTON _ Unfazed by the House Judiciary Committee's votes on
Friday, White House allies continued to lobby undeclared
rank-and-file Republicans to oppose impeachment next week on the
House floor, and many of the conflicted lawmakers voiced anguish
over the impending decision.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Geraldine Ferraro, the former congresswoman from
New York and vice presidential candidate, has contacted three House
Republicans _ Tillie Fowler of Florida, Marge Roukema of New Jersey
and Deborah Pryce of Ohio _ to sound out the views of Republican
women in Congress and to urge the lawmakers to oppose impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``She asked what I was thinking,'' Mrs. Fowler said in an
interview, ``and I told her I would vote for impeachment, and she
spent the next 15 minutes telling why that was the wrong decision.
She said it didn't amount to perjury and it wasn't an impeachable
offense. Then she said, a man is a man is a man, and said that
other presidents have done this kind of thing before.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House acknowledged it was deploying its allies in a
full-scale effort to avert impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly talking to friends around the country about
the importance of this matter and how the case that's been made by
the committee doesn't reach the standards of impeachment,'' Joe
Lockhart, the White House press secretary, said.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the White House presses for a censure vote, presidential
aides have contacted 45 possibly wavering Republicans to help
explain the president's defense.
</P>
<P>
   But undeclared Republicans continued to wrestle with the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jay Dickey of Arkansas, the only Republican to vote against
the impeachment inquiry, is still undecided. But the phone calls,
e-mail messages and letters to his offices have intensified greatly
in the last three days, he said, and they run 3-to-1 for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   More important, Dickey said, the tone of callers has become much
more threatening. ``Before, people were calling to say, `This is my
opinion,''' he said. ``Now they're saying, `If you don't impeach
him, you'll get a primary challenge.'''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Frank Riggs, R-Calif., who is retiring this year, is
leaning toward voting to impeach on at least the perjury charges.
But he said he had pulled back on his position after listening to
the debate in the last few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's influenced me the most over the last 24 to 48 hours is
the notion that the vote to impeach is a vote to remove,'' Riggs
said. ``Prior to that, I was favorable to the view that impeachment
is censure. I've raised the bar. That's reinforced the gravity of
the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The resistance by House Republican leaders to permit a censure
vote complicates the White House's flat-out campaign to sway dozens
of Republican House moderates.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders have been adamant that the full House will
vote next week only on articles of impeachment, not on censure.
Rep. Tom DeLay, the Republican whip, fears that permitting a
censure option would siphon votes away from impeachment. The
leadership strategy is intended to pressure as many as three dozen
undecided Republicans to vote to impeach the president on at least
one count.
</P>
<P>
   It is conceivable that if impeachment failed, Robert Livingston,
the new speaker, would relent and permit a censure vote. But at
that point, with the president out of peril, Democrats who wanted
censure as an alternative might balk, and Republicans who believed
a censure was unconstitutional or a bad precedent would also oppose
it.
</P>
<P>
   The precise dimensions of a censure are still shifting. Several
Democrats and Republicans have discussed including a strong
condemnation of the president's actions, to be signed by Clinton,
and a fine.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to win over Republicans, Clinton publicly
acknowledged for the first time on Friday that he would accept a
censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public consequences of my actions are in the hands of the
American people and their representatives in the Congress,''
Clinton said. ``Should they determine that my errors of word and
deed require their rebuke and censure, I am ready to accept that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart refused to parry with reporters over what censure
language the president would accept. ``I'm not going to get into a
negotiating position from here at this podium,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Unmoved by the White House's defense of the president this week
and Clinton's statement, six undeclared Republicans _ Jack Metcalf
of Washington, Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and
Lincoln Diaz-Balart, both of Florida, and Bob Franks and Rodney
Frelinghuysen, both of New Jersey _ announced Friday they would
vote to impeach the president.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``It is now clear that the president violated both his oath of
office and the oath he took to tell the truth,'' Frelinghuysen said
in a letter to constituents. ``In doing so, Bill Clinton not only
committed perjury, he violated the public trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Diaz-Balart, who an aide said turned down a White House offer on
Thursday to speak to the White House counsel, Charles Ruff, said in
a statement, ``Failure to impeach President Clinton would do grave
harm to the integrity of the judicial system in the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leadership aides said they expected two other
undeclared Republicans to announce their support for impeachment in
the next few days: Reps. Joe Skeen of New Mexico and Richard Baker
of Louisiana.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Dec. 12:
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to fathom what gain Bill Clinton thought he could
achieve Friday in restating his remorse over the Monica Lewinsky
case while still dodging the core issue of his deceitful testimony
under oath. The disconnection between Clinton's appearance at the
White House and the legal and constitutional charges bearing down
on him in Congress could not have been clearer.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after he once again failed to acknowledge that he had
lied under oath, House Judiciary Committee Republicans approved the
first of four articles of impeachment on the panel agenda. The
article revolves around alleged perjury.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' adoption of that and two other articles of
impeachment Friday was a disservice to the country. If the House
leaders in turn remain so bent on impeachment that they try to
block a vote on censure on the floor, the best hope of forcing
their hand rests with moderate Republicans, the group that will
determine whether Clinton becomes only the second president to be
impeached by the House. These lawmakers had been fairly shouting
across the capital all week that Clinton needed to reconcile
himself with the law if he hoped to prevent impeachment. Instead
the president spoke of reconciling himself with the American
people, while leaving his aides and lawyers, as he said, to deal
with the facts, the law and the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton at this point seems trapped in the legal and political
universe he and his lawyers have created. It allows for contrition
and apology, but denies the unmistakable offense of lying under
oath before a federal grand jury and in his testimony in the Paula
Jones civil suit. Gregory Craig and Charles Ruff poked a bit at
this obstacle in their appearances before the Judiciary Committee,
but no one seems willing or able to push it aside.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton may be betting that the House will blink first, or he
may be waiting to make one final, more confessional statement
closer to the House vote late next week. It is even possible that
he is prepared to let the case go to the Senate with the
expectation that he is unlikely to be convicted and removed from
office.
</P>
<P>
   But his primary motivation seems to be protecting himself
against criminal prosecution when he leaves the White House.
</P>
<P>
   That is a natural concern, but it ought not to be the decisive
consideration for a leader who is expected to place the interests
of the country above all else. If Clinton genuinely wishes to move
ahead with the nation's business, he must do his part to secure an
end to this matter short of impeachment and a potentially long and
divisive trial in the Senate. He declared his readiness to accept
congressional censure, but could not bring himself to say the words
that could produce that outcome.

RICE STILL PLAYS WELL BUT NO LONGER DOMINATES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (lb) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Steve Young, who will be in the Hall of Fame
with him, says nothing has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who thinks there still isn't greatness there is a
fool,'' the San Francisco quarterback said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Mariucci, who has walked a tightrope coaching him, sees a
champion. ``I don't know if there has ever been a better competitor
to play this game,'' the 49ers' coach said.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell Owens, whose talent as a receiver may have surpassed his
celebrated teammate's, says there is no question who remains the
best. ``Everything I ever learned came from him,'' Owens said.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing but admiration, respect and even awe for Jerry
Rice. But ask almost anyone in the National Football League,
especially on the 49ers, and there is an equally large dose of
carefully chosen words. No one wants to offend perhaps the greatest
receiver in football history. No one wants to state the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   It is this: Rice has become mortal. He is no longer Superman. He
no longer dominates a game or causes defensive coaches to have
sleepless nights.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that should be the end of the story; after all, football
players do age. But Rice, now 36, has not done so gracefully. He
admits that being forced to take a lesser role in an offense where
his name used to be called more times than not has been more
difficult to take than a hit from a 250-pound linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``This might be the season I have to play a different role,''
Rice said recently, standing in the 49ers' locker room. ``You've
got to swallow deep and live with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Rice is playing shows how great an athlete he is.
He damaged ligaments in his left knee at the beginning of last
season, which required surgery to repair. Then Rice defied
expectations and returned in December, only to severely damage the
knee again in his first game back.
</P>
<P>
   If Rice were not one of the game's most superbly conditioned
athletes _ his off-season workout program is legendary _
consecutive knee injuries could have ended his career. That
conditioning, as well as great physical skills and mental strength,
made him the focus of the 49ers' West Coast offense for years.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the current problem.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that Rice is still an effective player, but
the team has been developing other offensive weapons. Garrison
Hearst has his second straight 1,000-yard rushing season. J.J.
Stokes is a solid possession receiver. Owens is the team's most
dangerous player, a great blend of size and speed. When the Giants
were preparing to play the 49ers earlier this season, they
considered Owens, not Rice, San Francisco's biggest threat.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, 49er officials maintain that it is better to spread
the ball around to all of their offensive stars than to have Rice
as the primary option.
</P>
<P>
   What has become apparent _ and hard to say because for some it
is painful to do so _ is that Rice no longer has the physical
skills to be the offensive focal point. That's because Rice can no
longer run free of coverage the way he once did. And he no longer
makes an abundance of what coaches call y.a.c. yards _ yards after
the catch.
</P>
<P>
   Once a game, Rice could run a 10-yard slant pattern and turn it
into a 60-yard touchdown. Those moments are rare now.
</P>
<P>
   None of this should be surprising, because it would take a
player in his 20s several years to recover from two surgeries on
the same knee.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is what happened during the Nov. 15 game against
Atlanta, when a Falcons player banged his helmet on Rice's other
knee, the healthy one. That has slowed him even more, and against
Carolina on Dec. 6, Rice had five catches for only 36 yards. Owens
and Stokes combined for eight catches for 106 yards and three
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   What has made Rice great throughout his career is his strong
will, as well as his belief that no one is better than he is. No
knee injury will change that, and Rice is not ready to concede
anything. That is what led to his verbal explosion after San
Francisco's 31-20 victory over New Orleans two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Rice had three catches for 27 yards that game and was shut out
in the first half for the first time in six years. He was
occasionally used as the third receiver off the bench when the
49ers went to a two-receiver set with Stokes and Owens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just work here,'' he said after the game. ``If nothing is
asked of me, I guess I'm not going to do much. If you ask me if I'm
having a good time, no. Is this something that might make you
retire? Hell, yes. All I know is I'm not having a good time. Maybe
it's time to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   What was puzzling about Rice's comments was that at the time, he
ledthe National Football Conference with 61 catches. According to
the 49ers' coaching statistics, Rice had 121 passes thrown his way
in the first 11 games. Owens and Stokes had 81 and 76,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Rice was blasted by sports columnists across the country for
being selfish. But he said recently: ``I have been around 14 years
and have always been a team player. Why can't I have my own opinion
without getting crucified?''
</P>
<P>
   Rice asked, ``I was unhappy about catching three balls, but who
wouldn't be, as a competitor?''
</P>
<P>
   Rice has complained in the past after games when he felt more
passes should have come his way. To the 49ers, that's as normal as
a fogged-in San Francisco bridge.
</P>
<P>
   After such complaints, more balls usually do go Rice's way in
the following game. But he had only three catches against the
Giants the week after that Saints game.
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci and Rice spoke for about 30 minutes after the Saints
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of our conversation was to make sure we kept him
involved, but we also want to keep other guys involved,'' the coach
said. ``We want Jerry fresh for the stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem Mariucci faced as a result of Rice's outburst was
this: If he capitulated to his receiver and immediately ordered
more passes thrown his way, it could have weakened him in the eyes
of other players. Mariucci had to take a stance for the good of his
team, which is 10-3 heading into Monday night's game against the
Detroit Lions and still battling for a division title.
</P>
<P>
   Where do things stand now? Rice is being a good citizen. After
other receivers make good catches in practices or games, Rice is
the first to congratulate them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going to enjoy myself, smile, watch these young guys
make plays and do what I can,'' Rice said. ``I don't want to lower
my standards, but I've got to enjoy football because its going to
end soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Against the Giants, after Owens made a spectacular 79-yard
touchdown catch, Rice ran up to the muscular receiver, hugged him,
and said, ``I remember doing that.''

MURDER CONSPIRACY ALLEGED IN VOODOO RITUAL BURNING 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A voodoo priest in New Jersey and two other people were indicted
Friday on charges that they conspired to kill a New York woman who
was burned in a religious ritual that she sought as a means of
driving away evil spirits, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Marie DeGraff, 30, of Uniondale, N.Y., a Haitian
immigrant who also uses the first name Sheila, was burned on her
head, face and neck in October 1997 when a cloth doused with a
flammable liquid was placed on her head and ignited, said Ray
Weiss, a spokesman for the Essex County prosecutor's office in New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DeGraff, a registered nurse and Haitian pop singer, was
hospitalized for three weeks in the burn unit at St. Barnabas
Medical Center in Livingston, N.J., where she received skin grafts,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The voodoo priest, Pierrot Charles, 41, of Irvington, N.J., and
Jean Valme, 36, of Brooklyn, N.Y., who was identified as the
victim's boyfriend, were charged with conspiracy to commit murder,
attempted murder, aggravated assault and criminal restraint, Weiss
said. Carolyn Destin, 39, identified by the authorities as Charles'
common-law wife, was charged with conspiracy to commit murder.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DeGraff said last fall that her friends had convinced her
that noises she was hearing in her basement were her father's bad
spirits and that Charles could drive the spirits away. She went to
Irvington, a city with one of the largest populations of Haitian
immigrants in New Jersey, and underwent nine nights of prayer. On
the ninth night, she said, Charles covered her head and body with a
white sheet. Then she heard a whooshing noise and realized she was
on fire, she said. She was injured with second- and third-degree
burns.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment charges that Charles and Valme did not permit Ms.
DeGraff to seek treatment for the burns for 24 hours, Weiss said.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment does not specify a motive for attempted murder,
and Weiss refused to elaborate. ``Until this gets to trial, that's
not something that we're at liberty to talk about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Steven Palamara of the Irvington police said he was
unaware of any motive behind the attempted murder charge.
</P>
<P>
   Charles' attorney, James Weinberg, said that's because there was
no motive. He said his client is innocent and that Ms. DeGraff, not
Charles, doused herself with the flammable liquid, a cologne known
as Florida Water that is used in voodoo rituals, and that she
accidentally set herself ablaze when she bumped into a candle.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Ms. DeGraff refused treatment immediately after the
incident, and that someone else finally called an ambulance the
next day.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DeGraff did not respond to messages left at her home and on
her pager Friday. Attempts to reach Mr. Valme were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg said Ms. DeGraff has filed a civil suit claiming her
injuries were the result of negligence by Charles and Valme. He
said the criminal allegations were contrived to help her win a
settlement in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg also said prosecutors may have felt pressure to file
charges because the case attracted considerable attention and
because of negative connotations associated with voodoo, a mix of
African and Christian religious beliefs originally developed on
slave plantations in Haiti. Ms. DeGraff's lawyer in the civil suit,
Stuart Siegel, said there was no link between the criminal and
civil cases, other than that they stemmed from the same incident.

SALT LAKE OFFICIALS FACE QUERY INTO FUND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Utah)  (lb) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ The disclosure of a scholarship fund in
Salt Lake City is generating considerable activity on the shores of
Lake Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   Acting with uncommon urgency, the International Olympic
Committee formed a special commission on Friday to investigate
scholarship payments allegedly made to relatives of some IOC
members by Salt Lake City officials during their successful bid to
play host to the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   The payments, categorized as a bribe by Mark Hodler, an IOC
member, were made through a privately financed $500,000 fund
beginning in 1991, the year Salt Lake City was beaten by Nagano,
Japan, in the bidding for the 1998 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   The four-man ad hoc commission, whose chairman will be Richard
Pound, the IOC vice president, will consider the evidence and
attempt to deliver a ruling. No deadline has been set, but the
commission was already at work Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should say that the executive board takes this matter very
seriously,'' said Pound, a Canadian lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite many requests made in the past or evidence to support
rumors that have been floating around, we've never had anything
come forward,'' he added, in reference to rumblings of attempted
vote-buying by other Olympic cities and aspiring Olympic cities.
``Specific allegations have now been made, and as you can see, the
executive board has acted very quickly to investigate.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound, who had yet to examine any of the related documents,
declined to comment on what action his commission might take. ``We
are not going to make any conclusions or any speculation until we
know what the facts are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   John Krimsky, the U.S. Olympic Committee deputy
secretary-general, said he believed stripping Salt Lake City of the
Games was ``not even a remote possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Please understand that the organization of the Salt Lake
Olympic Committee today is a very different group than it was
during the bid,'' he said. ``There are a couple of carry-overs, but
this is not the same group.''
</P>
<P>
   One holdover is Frank Joklik, the SLOC president, who was
chairman of the executive committee when Salt Lake City
successfully bid in 1995. The bid-committee president, Tom Welch,
resigned from the Salt Lake committee last year.
</P>
<P>
   Joklik was called to a meeting with Juan Antonio Samaranch, the
IOC president, on Friday in Lausanne and furnished documents
relating to the case. ``We intend to be fully cooperative,'' Joklik
said.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Joklik and David Johnson, senior vice
president of the Salt Lake committee, who was also part of the team
that bid for the games, met with Pound's new commission. The other
three commission members are Thomas Bach of Germany, Jacques Rogge
of Belgium and Judge Keba Mbaye of Senegal. They and Pound are
among the most influential members of the IOC
</P>
<P>
   The scholarship fund's alleged connection with IOC members was
disclosed by a television station in Salt Lake City two weeks ago.
On Tuesday, officials of the Salt Lake committee announced that 13
individuals were given scholarships or training grants during the
program that operated between 1991 and 1995, when Salt Lake City
was the overwhelming choice to be host to the 2002 Games. Of the 13
individuals who received assistance, six were related to IOC
members.
</P>
<P>
   The only relative of an IOC member to have been identified is
Sonia Essomba, the daughter of Rene Essomba of Cameroon, who has
since died. Sonia Essomba was given money to attend American
University in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Joklik said earlier this week that the fund was established to
help offer educational and athletic training opportunities to those
from poorer countries. But he said some of those who received
assistance were probably from more privileged backgrounds than most
Africans. Rene Essomba was a prominent Cameroonian physician and
former secretary-general of the National Olympic Committees of
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already stated that I do not regard what was done as
bribery, even though I recognize that there have been perceptions
contrary to that,'' Joklik said Friday. ``I regret those
perceptions but don't feel they are justified.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Francois Carrard, the IOC director, said this was the most
significant case of alleged ethical misconduct before the committee
since Robert Helmick was accused of conflict of interest in 1991.
Helmick eventually resigned from the IOC and as president of the
U.S. Olympic Committee.

HOOSIERS ON BRINK OF FOURTH NATIONAL TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ind., Md.)  (rl) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. _ Indiana was efficient. Stanford was
opportunistic. On Sunday they will play for the men's national
collegiate soccer championship.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana (22-2) set the tempo against Santa Clara in the first
minute Friday, pinning the Broncos in the penalty area. They
continued to dominate for the next 89 minutes and breezed to a 4-0
victory in the opener of the semifinals at the University of
Richmond. The Hoosiers will try to win their fourth title.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford (18-4-2) will try to win its first championship after
defeating Maryland, 1-0, on a fluke goal in the 39th minute. The
score came when Lee Morrison headed Jamie Clark's throw-in from the
left of the goal. A Maryland defender, Beckett Hollenbach, headed
it out but right back to Morrison, who headed the ball back toward
the goal. This time the ball hit the post and fell into the net as
Hollenbach was unable to block it.
</P>
<P>
   In five previous trips to the tournament, Stanford had not won a
game. Now it is in the final. Maryland (16-8) had the territorial
advantage for most of the game, taking 16 shots to Stanford's nine,
and was especially forceful in the second half, when a Maryland
goal was disallowed by the referee, Alex Yvahnenko, because Andy
Hemmerich fouled the Stanford goalkeeper, Adam Zapala.
</P>
<P>
   Judged by Friday's performance of the two finalists, the
Hoosiers must be considered the favorite in Sunday's championship
game, which will be broadcast by ESPN at 2 p.m. All four goals by
Indiana were well executed and delighted the crowd of 17,616.
</P>
<P>
   Aleksei Korol, the crafty striker from the Ukraine, led the
Hoosiers with two goals, with Dema Kovalenko, also from the
Ukraine, and Nick Garcia scoring once each in a game completely
dominated by Indiana, the champion in 1982, 1983 and 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew the opposition was difficult to play against and we
were able to dictate the style,'' said Coach Jerry Yeagley of
Indiana, who avenged semifinal losses to Santa Clara in 1989 and
1991. ``This was our day.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Alexander, Santa Clara's goalkeeper, was hampered by a
right knee injury he suffered in the quarterfinal victory over St.
John's last Saturday, and had to wear a brace.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very focused and we were tentative,'' he said. ``I
don't want to use my knee as an excuse, but we were on our heels
from the start.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Mitch Murray of Santa Clara apparently felt Alexander was
probably better on one leg than his backup, Rusty Johnson, who had
played only six minutes all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goalkeeper was not the problem,'' Murray said. ``We
retreated too much and we were not stepping up to the ball. They
physically intimidated us and they're good technically.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hoosiers displayed plenty of skill in all parts of the
field. They varied their attack and exhibited effective finishing
primarily because of Korol, who scored both goals in last Sunday's
elimination of Clemson, which entered the tournament as the
top-seeded team.
</P>
<P>
   Korol scored the first goal in the 20th minute, when he stepped
onto a rebound from a shot by Kovalenko and beat Alexander from 15
yards. Garcia gave the Hoosiers a two-goal lead just over three
minutes later from 16 yards away before Korol scored his second,
five minutes into the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Kovalenko's goal with 12 minutes remaining was the first time
Santa Clara (15-5-2) had allowed four goals in a game in six years.
