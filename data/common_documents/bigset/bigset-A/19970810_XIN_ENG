<HEADLINE> Obstacles to Investments in Zambia Pinpointed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
offered incentives in recent years to attract investments and
made achievements but there is still obstacles, a Zambian
official has said.
</P>
<P>
In an address to the international seminar, whose theme is
from stabilization to growth and poverty alleviation, Bwalya
Ng'andu, director general of Zambia investment center, said the
deterioration in existing road infrastructure and Zambia's
inability to construct new roads have had the most telling effect
on the investment in tourism and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
With no private sector having actively participate in
infrastructural development, the government will for some time
have the task of constructing and rehabilitating infrastructure
in the medium term, he said at the three-day seminar held here.
</P>
<P>
Ng'andu said investment from the public sector in
infrastructure will need to be harmonized more and more with the
private sector in order to further encourage investment by the
latter.
</P>
<P>
"The reduction in public expenditure has also reduced
investment into education, health and infrastructure. This has
had a negative effect on the development of the human resource.
</P>
<P>
"This s a matter of concern because investors are looking for
a professionally trained work force with a variety of
entrepreneural skills," the director noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the private sector and market occupy the center stage
in Zambia's economic policies... accordingly the promotion and
attraction of private sector investment remains essential to the
attainment of such economic objectives as the creation of
productive jobs, poverty alleviation and enhanced economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
The task facing Zambia is not one of scarcity of resources but
rather one of increasing its capacity and capability to attract a
greater share of available international private capital, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Local and foreign bankers, businessmen and representatives of
international organizations attended the three-day seminar which
ended Friday.

ATHENS, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. men's squad toppled out of
the running in the 4x100-meter relay first round when Montgomery
failed to catch Brian Lewis' baton on the first straight here today at
the World Athletics Championships.
</P>
<P>
An American team met the same trouble at the previous championships
and an American squad also suffered the same fate in the 1988 Olympic
Games.
</P>
<P>
Dennis Mitchell, the third leg man for the U.S.team who badly hoped
to get a gold medal, flew into a fury after the disaster.
</P>
<P>
"We just messed the stick up! Just a mistake and we are out!
</P>
<P>
"From what I could see they just missed the stick but even then I
thought we coulld salvage something, but when Montgomery stopped that
was it!"
</P>
<P>
Mitchell also added:"We had a young team in 1995, a young team in
1996, and now another young team in 1997. We'll put this thing
together and get on top of it."

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Legislature To Draft Conscription Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The 88-member legislative
Palestinian Council (PC) today adopted a resolution on drafting
the country's first conscription law, according to a report of
JMCC, a Palestinian press service based in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The legislators voted unanimously for the resolution at an
emergency session held in the West Bank city of Ramallah. Under
the resolution, the PC Legal Committee will draw up the law and
submit it for final approval to the Palestinian National Authority
led by President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Azmi el-Shuai'bi, the lawmaker who initiated the proposal, said
that Palestinian university graduates will have to undergo
military and public services for a period ranging from six months
to a year.
</P>
<P>
The conscripts will receive training that enables them to
defend the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
Addressing today's session, Arafat again lashed out at the
harsh security measures adopted by the Israeli authorities
following the double suicide bombing attack in Jerusalem last
week.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader accused Israel of waging state
terrorism against the Palestinian people as punishment for the
attack committed not by local Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He said bitterly that Israel imposed a total closure on the
Palestinian territories in order to "strangle the Palestinian
people."
</P>
<P>
Arafat continued that the Palestinian people are committed to
peace, peace of brave, not to peace of dictation, orders,
starvation and siege.
</P>
<P>
He declared that the Palestinian people who are committed to
real peace will not kneel to such force.

<HEADLINE> Lusaka's Biggest Market Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba today officially opened Lusaka's biggest market, the
Lusaka City Market.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony of the 30,000-square-meter market,
formerly, Soweto Market, Chiluba said the government is concerned
over the unhygienic and unorganized trade in the country,
particularly in major towns where street vending is prevalent due
to inadequate markets.
</P>
<P>
He said the government appreciates efforts by ordinary
Zambians who are creating employment opportunities for themselves
by engaging in trade.
</P>
<P>
"We appreciate this effort because the formal sector has no
capacity to absorb all job seekers," the president said.
</P>
<P>
The national development will come from millions of
self-employed Zambians and the markets have a significant place
in the process, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba promised to provide decent and modern markets and
rehabilitate the existing ones to enable both sellers and buyers
to conduct their business transactions in a conducive and
hygienic environment.
</P>
<P>
An effective management system will be put in place on a
commercial basis through contract so that capital investment can
be recovered over a reasonable period of time.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Godfrey Miyanda and several government
ministers attended the ceremony and toured the 3,000-stall market
accompanying Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
Numerous street vendors do business in Zambia's downtown
centers because of inadequacy of market places. However, the
vendors are blamed for the insanitary environment and insecurity.
Businessmen in stores complain that the vendors seize business
opportunities from them by doing business just in the corridors
of their stores.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry today
condemned recent Israeli attack against south Lebanon and
appealed to the international community to take serious measures
against "Tel Aviv's violation of international regulations."
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Mohammadi, spokesman for the Foreign Ministry,
expressed Tehran's concern over the situation in south Lebanon,
which he said was "critical and dangerous."
</P>
<P>
"The resumption of barbaric attacks of the Zionist regime
further aggravates the tension in the region," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said the fresh tensions created by Tel Aviv in the
occupied territories and south Lebanon stem from Washington's
unconditional support for the Israeli regime.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Islamic countries to isolate the Israeli
regime and urged international forums to condemn Tel Aviv in
order to contain the scope of the crisis in the Middle
East.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 9 (Xinhua) -- More than 500 illegal
immigrants from various African states have been crossing into
South Africa's Northern Province every month, an army officer
said today.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Dries Van Jaarsveld, a military spokesman, told
reporters near Messina, Northern Province that a large percentage
of the illegals came from Rwanda, Burundi and Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Some Somalis had also entered the country illegally during the
past month, Van Jaarsveld said.
</P>
<P>
He said defense force patrols usually handed illegals over
immediately to police or immigration officials as repatriation
was not the soldiers' duties.
</P>
<P>
According to the officer, estimates of the number of illegal
immigrants currently inside the country varied from three million
to eight million.

ATHENS, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Ana Fidelia Quirot of Cuba won the
women's 800 meters world title here today at the 6th World Athletics
Championships.
</P>
<P>
The defending champion clocked one minute 57.14 seconds to give her
country's fourth gold. Yelena Afanasyeva of Russia finished second in
1:57.56. Maria Mutola of Mozambique was third in 1:57.59.
</P>
<P>
Quirot, who was almost burned to death in a fire accident in 1993,
but came back strongly to win the world title in 1995, was happy about
her victory.
</P>
<P>
"After our men athletes won three golds here, I wasn't sure that I
could win the race today. I was thinking the whole night about this
and hardly could sleep," said the 34-year-old.
</P>
<P>
Afanasyeva told the press a story at the conference. "You will not
believe it but I twice dreamed that I would end this race in second.
So I put the following sentence on a piece of paper - 'I was second' -
and put it in a book called the Soviet Encyclopedia, two days before
departure. As you see, dreams do come true!"
</P>
<P>
Mutola, the 1993 world champion, was just upset, saying:"I just
don't know, I just lost the race. I went out today planning to run
faster than that but it just didn't happen. I lost and I have to
accept that."

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Hiromi Suzuki of Japan won the women's
marathon world title here today at the 6th World Athletics
Championships.
</P>
<P>
Her winning time was two hours, 29 minutes 48 seconds, ahead of
Portugal's defending champion Manuela Machado's 2:31:12, and Romania's
Lidia Simon's 2:31:55.
</P>
<P>
Fatuma Roba of Ethiopia, Olympic champion, led the pace in the
first 10km with the top three medal winners hanging closely with her.
</P>
<P>
At the half distance point, Machado took the leading position with
five other runners on her heels. Suzuki sat at the 10th, four seconds
behind the leading group.
</P>
<P>
But after 25 kilometers, the race turned to a battle just between
Suzuki and Machado, only world silver medal winner Anuta Catuna of
Romania hanging tough with the pair, the others had faded for good.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese opened a 17-second lead in front of Machado at the
30km and never looked back to win Japan's first gold in
championships history.
</P>
<P>
"What supported me most was that I started this race with four
other Japanese runners. I focussed on Roba first, but I didn't realise
that she had disappeared so early. The most important thing for me now
is to have a real Japanese hot bath," said the small Japanese winner.
</P>
<P>
Simon, the bronze medal winner in London marathon this year,
said:"At the 25km point I missed my drink, therefore I got into a
crisis and felt sick. After that I recovered and managed to get from
the sixth place to the bronze finish."

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 9 (Xinhua) -- An Amtrak train carrying about
300 passengers derailed off a bridge in northwestern Arizona
today, injuring more than 100 people, including some 50 in serious
condition.
</P>
<P>
The number of critically injured was unknown, but Mohave County
sheriff's spokeswoman Jody Schanaman told reporters about 50 were
seriously injured and 90 suffered minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
Officials conducted a car-to-car search of the train and found
no fatalities, she said. Earlier reports said about eight people
were killed.
</P>
<P>
The injured were taken by bus and helicopter to Kingman
Regional Medical Center, where 20 to 25 were treated in the
emergency room, mostly for broken limbs and bruises
</P>
<P>
The train was eastbound at about 90 mph (150 kilometers) and at
least five cars derailed 13 miles (22 kilometers) east of Kingman
on a Burlington Northern-Santa Fe line.
</P>
<P>
It appeared rain overnight was to blame, Schanaman said.
</P>
<P>
"We received severe heavy rainfall starting at about 1 a.m.
this morning and the rainfall caused the bridge to shift, and as
the train was going over it, it buckled," Schanaman said.
</P>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board said it was sending
investigators from Washington, D.C., this afternoon.

HARARE, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government today
released over 360 of the long-awaited checks to compensate
victims of liberation struggle which led to the country's
independence in 1980 under the War Victims Compensation Fund.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Compensation Office in Harare today started
handing out the checks at the headquarters of the Zimbabwe
National Liberations War Veterans Association (ZNLWVA) and will
continue even during coming public holidays.
</P>
<P>
ZNLWVA Chairman Chenjerai Hunzvi said all the checks would be
collected in Harare to avoid any further delays.
</P>
<P>
"This issue is very urgent but we have noted that some of the
checks being sent out in the name of war victims are actually
payments for injuries sustained at work," he said.
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately known how much money was being paid out
from the fund.
</P>
<P>
Hunzvi invited all those expecting payments under the War
Victims Compensation Fund to visit the ZNLWVA headquarters to
collect their checks as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of war veterans staged demonstrations across the
country last month, demanding payment under the War Victims
Compensation Fund which was halted in March this year following
allegations of gross abuse of millions of Dollars of the fund.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is expected to
double its tea exports this year over the figure of about 19,000
tons recorded in the year of 1996.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Ayoub Chamshama, General Manager of the
Tanzania Tea Blender (TTB) at the Nane Nane Agricultural Show
grounds in Arusha, northern Tanzania today, according to a report
received here.
</P>
<P>
"We have already launched a special drive to improve our
exports and we are optimistic we'll explore new markets and
double our earnings this year," Chamshama said.
</P>
<P>
The TTB in collaboration with the Tanzania Tea Authority has
started a new project in Dabaga and Iringa for small farmers to
increase tea production in the country.
</P>
<P>
The experimental project involves about 3,000 hectares of
arable land and out of which nine hectares have already been
cultivated. The first results are expected in three years time.
</P>
<P>
"We want more small farmers to participate in the tea
production and earn the country the badly needed revenue,"
Chamchama said.

All the tourists later headed for Cairo, the capital of Egypt,
to resume their tour, the source said.

<HEADLINE> Environmental Education Urged in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Vice President
Omar Juma today called on Members of Parliament to educate people
in their constituencies on environmental protection to save the
country from looming desertification.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania is in a very bad environmental situation requiring
urgent measures to save natural resources now in peril, Juma said
while opening a one-day environmental seminar for MPs in Dodoma
where the Tanzanian National Assembly is located.
</P>
<P>
Juma noted, "If we do not reach a stage where every tanzanian
knew and feared to destroy or pollute environment, we will fail
to save the country from looming calamities."
</P>
<P>
He added that people should be educated on environmental
conservation and stop notions that the government, municipalities
or councils are the ones who will clean towns and villages. It is
the people themselves who will plant trees and clean their areas.
</P>
<P>
Juma said the country has high environmental pollution that is
threatening to lower the 52-year life expectancy of Tanzanians
and at the same time bring epidemics such as cholera.
</P>
<P>
Lack of simple and cheap alternative sources of energy are
making people cut down trees for fire wood and charcoal, which
result in destruction of sources of water and reduced rainfall.
</P>
<P>
Juma noted that the solution to end environmental pollution
and degradation lie in education to the people to stop these
malpractices.

<P>
ATHENS, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Liudmila Galkina of Russia rose at the
right occasion to win the women's long jump world title here today at
the 6th World Athletics Championships.
</P>
<P>
Her winning leap was 7.05 meters, the world best this season as
well as a personal best. Another less-known jumper Niki Xanthou of
Greece brought the yelling crow to their feet by landing the silver at
6.94. Defending champion Fiona May of Italy won the bronze at 6.91.
</P>
<P>
Many big names slumped in the final. Olympic champion and the
year's leader Chioma Ajunwa injuried in the first round and pulled out
of the battle. American champion and 100m winner Marion Jones only
managed a 6.63 best, finishing 10th.
</P>
<P>
Former world record holder Heike Drechsler of Germany was beaten
fourth at 6.89 and American legend Jackie Joyner-Kersee was sixth at
6.79.
</P>
<P>
"First of all I would like to thank all my opponents for helping me
to get the utmost from me. We all knew that the first one to jump
seven meters would be the sure winner. Although I had a slight
headache I managed it," Galkina said after her unexpected win.
</P>
<P>
Xanthou said:"Today I defeated athletes who are usually ahead of
me. In a world championship however every athlete starts from scratch
and you have to prove you can do your best."

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti coast guards and
police have on several occasions arrested 24 Iranians trying
to enter the Gulf emirate illegally, Kuwaiti Interior Ministry
said today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a statement that 13 Iranians were caught
after trying to infiltrate into the country via sea when they
were spotted by radars.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that undercover policemen of the southern
city of Al-Zor have also been able to arrest seven more Iranians
who tried to enter the country illegally.
</P>
<P>
A police patrol apprehended four more Iranian infiltrators on
an expressway toward the Kuwaiti city, it said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that all the infiltrators had been referred
to authorities concerned. But it did not say when the three groups
of people were arrested.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait usually repatriates infiltrators after they are
interrogated and determined that they are not involved in any
political or espionage design.

<HEADLINE> Situation in Dushanbe Deteriorates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The situation around Dushanbe,
Capital of Tajikistan, assumed a dangerous and unpredictable
character after the outbreak of fighting between presidential
guards and a rapid reaction brigade commanded by Col. Makhmud
Khudoiberdyev on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency quoted presidential guards commander
Gafar Mirzoyev as reporting that Khudoiberdyev's units using all
types of weapons tried to enter Dushanbe to support the armed
supporters of Yakub Salimov, chairman of the national customs
committee, who are exchanging fire with the Tajik Interior
Ministry's special brigade led by Col. Sukhrob Kasymov, in the
northern part of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have sustained losses, including two guards were
killed and three wounded, while casualties among Khudoiberdyev's
men are not known yet.
</P>
<P>
One of the high-ranking government official said that certain
forces are trying to provoke clashes between former allies in the
Popular Front and destabilize the situation in the republic.
</P>
<P>
A fierce shoot-out between supporters of Colonel Sukhrob
Kasymov, commander of a special purpose brigade of the Tajik
Interior Ministry, and supporters of Customs committee Chairman
Yakub Salimov broke out north of Dushanbe earlier today and
stopped by midday.
</P>
<P>
It was reported early that the fighting two sides reached an
agreement to stop the conflict through the mediation of the
government and members of a CIS peacekeeping force stationed in
Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
Kasymov and Salimov had reportedly signed a cease-fire protocol
that took effect at 14:30 (0900 GMT).
</P>
<P>
According to another report, the Dushanbe-based mission of the
International Committee of the Red Cross has decided to provide
assistance to the wounded people in the armed conflict in
Dushanbe.

WASHINGTON, August 9 (Xinhua) _ A Conrail freight train bound
from New York to Pennsylvania derailed in South Plainfield, New
Jersey this morning, but there were no injuries reported.
</P>
<P>
At least 30 of the train's 96 cars went off the track at 11:25
a.m. EDT during an emergency application of the breaks, the United
Press quoted a Conrail official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The train, traveling from Albany, New York to Allentown,
Pennsylvania, was pulling a mix of freight and tanker cars, but
officials say no hazardous waste was spilled.
</P>
<P>
Investigation is under way. It was unclear whether the engineer
applied the breaks or they were tripped automatically by the
train's safety system.
</P>
<P>
Officials say equipment is on the way to the crash site to
clear the tracks, which are part of the heavily traveled Lehigh

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM to Go Ahead with Education Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz said today he is determined to strive for the approval of
the eight-year compulsory education reform bill.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz voiced his decision while inaugurating a newly built
hospital in the Black Sea city of Trabzon in northeastern Turkey,
the semi-official Anatolia News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister vowed to keep on pushing for his
government-proposed eight-year compulsory education bill even if
it costs him his political career.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP) headed by
former Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan and its followers, Yilmaz
noted that those who vehmently oppose the education reform bill
were actually attempting to establish the rule of Shariah, or
Islamic law, in the secular country.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz, who came to power following the June 18 resignation of
Erbakan, said that he was determined to fight those who were
utilizing religion for the sake of their political ambition.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan was ousted under pressure from the powerful military,
which favors secular rule in the mainly Muslim-populated country
and had accused Erbakan of inching Turkey toward Islamism.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue down our path because ours is the right
path," Yilmaz said.
</P>
<P>
The education reform bill, initiated by the Education Ministry,
has triggered strong opposition from the RP and other conservative
Islamists, for it would clamp down on religious teaching and lead
to possible closure of religious schools.
</P>
<P>
Some 4,000 people staged a demonstration here late last month
to express their anger, demanding the Parliament to block the
adoption of the bill. The RP, meanwhile, has vowed to use all
necessary means to abort the scheme on education reform.
</P>
<P>
The education reform, however, has enjoyed wide support from
the military and other secularist force.
</P>
<P>
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, a supporter of the current
Yilmaz government, reaffirmed early this week that Turkey's
secularism must be respected.
</P>
<P>
The Word Bank has also announced to grant a 1 billion
U.S. dollar in loan to support Turkey's education reform.
</P>
<P>
The education reform bill is currently under white-hot debate in
the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here noted that the education reform program, worked
out in accordance with the military suggestion, aimed to curb the
rapidly expanding fundamentalist force in the secular republic,

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 9 (Xinhua) -- A serious food shortage is
expected this year in Ethiopia, the latest monthly Food Security
Bulletin issued in Addis Ababa at the weekend said.
</P>
<P>
At least 88,750 tons of grain are in short supply as a result
of irregular rains, the Southern African Broadcasting Association
(SABA) quoted the bulletin as saying.
</P>
<P>
Less than normal rains have fallen in Ethiopia's highlands,
the country's leading farming region.
</P>
<P>
The bulletin said total food aid available for the needy in
the east African country currently stands at 175,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
It said some additional 40,000 tons in food aid is expected to
come from the United States, while another 29,000 tons will come
from the World Food Program.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia's Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Commission
said over 1.2 million people are in need of food aid.

<HEADLINE> Jones Lands Second Gold, Galkina Leaps Year's World Best </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 9 (Xinhua) -- American Marion Jones took her second
gold medal after the U.S. women's sprint relay and Russia's Liudmila
Galkina leaped the year's world best in the women's long jump on the
penultimate day of the 6th World Athletics Championships here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The day saw the American men's 4x100m relay team's dream of winning
the gold end after a hand-over failure on the back straight, and
several world famous women long jumpers slump in the sand pit.
</P>
<P>
So far the United States has raked up 15 medals including six
golds, two silvers and seven bronzes. Cuba shot to the second position
with a 4-1-1 combination, followed by Germany, 3-1-3.
</P>
<P>
Jones, the 100m newly-crowned world champion, became the first
person at the meet to chalk up a double victory after Gail Devers
anchored a 41.47-second win, a new meet record, only 0.10 seconds
outside the listed world record. The win made up Jones' disastrous
display in the long jump final, in which she wound up 10th at
6.63 meters.
</P>
<P>
Galkina rose at the right occasion to get her personal best in the
third round to win the long jump gold at 7.05 meters. Another
less-known jumper Niki Xanhou of Greece brought the yelling crowd to
their feet by landing the silver at 6.94, ahead of defending champion
Fiona May of Italy's 6.91.
</P>
<P>
Olympic champion and the year's leader Chioma Ajunwa of Nigeria got
injuried in the first round. Former world record holder Heike
Drechsler of Germany was beaten to the fourth, one position better
than American legend Jackie Joyner-Kersee.
</P>
<P>
"First of all I would like to thank all my opponents for helping me
to get the utmost from me," said Galkina, whose previous best finish
was a second place in an IAAF Grand Prix meet this year.
</P>
<P>
Xanthou said:"Today I defeated athletes who are usually ahead of
me. In a world championship however every athlete starts from scratch
and you have to prove you can do your best."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. men's relay squad suffered the same fate when Tim
Montgomery failed to catch the baton of Brian Lewis in the first heat
of the relay. Lewis ran the first leg fast, but was unable to get the
stick to Montgomery who started too early and then stopped out of the
exchange zone.
</P>
<P>
An American squad was out of the final at the previous meet after
the baton dropped, and a men's team also had an exchange failure in
the 1988 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Dennis Mitchell, the team's third leg man, flew into a fury after
the disaster. "We just messed the stick up! From what I could see they
just missed the stick but even then I thought we could salvage
something, but when Montgomery stopped, that was it!
</P>
<P>
"We had young teams in 1995, 1996 and 1997. We'll put this thing
together and get on top of it."
</P>
<P>
However, Ana Fidelia Quirot of Cuba defended her world title
successfully by winning the women's 800 meters, bringing her country's
fourth gold. Yelena Afanasyeva of Russia finished second in 1:57.56
and Maria Mutola of Mozambique was third in 1:57.59.
</P>
<P>
"After our men athletes won three golds here, I wasn't sure that I
could win the race today. I was thinking the whole night about this
and hardly could sleep," said the 34-year-old, who was almost burned
to death by fire in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Afanasyeva told the press a shocking story. "You will not believe
it but I twice dreamed that I would end this race in second. So I put
the following sentence on a piece of paper - 'I was second' - and put
it in a book two days before departure. As you see, dreams do come
true!"
</P>
<P>
Mutola, the 1993 world champion, was just upset, saying:"I just
don't know, I just lost the race. I went out today planning to run
faster than that, but it just didn't happen. "
</P>
<P>
Hiromi Suzuki won the first gold for Japan in the women's marathon
this morning in 2:29.48, ahead of Manuela Machado of Portugal and
Lidia Simon of Romania. Olympic champion Fatuma Roba of Ethiopia
didn't finish the tough race.
</P>
<P>
"What supported me most was that I started this race with four
other Japanese runners. I focussed on Roba first, but I didn't realise
that she had disappeared so early. The most important thing for me now
is to have a real Japanese bath, " said the small Japanese winner
after the win.
</P>
<P>
Trine Hattestad of Norway unleashed a mighty heave to win the
women's javelin title at 68.78 meters, in front of Australia's Joanna
Stone, 68.64, and Germany's Tanja Damaske, 67.12. Felicia Tilea, the
world leader and silver medal winner in 1995, finished fifth, and
Olympic champion Heli Rantanen of Finland wound up a further 10th.
</P>
<P>
Hattestad said:"My husband was sitting on the stands and my two
sons were watching the battle back in the hotel, these two facts
inspired me very much."
</P>
<P>
The day's last gold went to Gabriela Szabo of Romania, who outraced
Italy's Roberta Brunet and Portugal's Fernanda Ribeiro with a winning
time 14:57.68 in the women's 5,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
Szabo said after the final:"My strong finish is a gift from God but
I tried to help him by bettering myself. The most important day of
this season for me ended happily. I expected it would be tactical, the
finish deciding it all."

Nine finals are scheduled on Sunday, the last day of the

<HEADLINE> Camerounians Urged to Combat AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, August 9 (Xinhua) -- A one-day seminar held here has
urged the Camerounian public to be aware of the use of
preservatives so as to fight AIDS, according to Radio Cameroun
today.
</P>
<P>
Cameroun's public health authorities reminded the seminar
participants, mainly distributors of preservatives that the use
of preservatives remains the sole means of combating the spread
of sexually transmitted disease, especially AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the business benefit that goes along with the
distribution of condoms, distributors were called upon to
sensitize the public on the use of preservatives against AIDS.
</P>
<P>
They were trained on the proper use of condoms at the seminar
which ended Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At the closing ceremony, Cameroun's health minister Charles
Etoundi awarded diplomats to the 20 participants.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was organized by the Cameroun social marketing
program which was instituted in October, 1989. Since then, over
46 million condoms have been distributed by the organization
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of the organization is to sensitize the
Camerounian public on the use of preservatives in combating
sexually transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
In less than 10 years, Cameroun has moved from a low AIDS
prevalence country up to an almost middle prevalence one. With a
population of 13 millions in Cameroun, the prevalence moved from
0.5 percent to 4.8 percent in 1995 and 5.5 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the public health ministry reveals that by the
year 2000, 200,000 cases of AIDS might be officially declared.
Ninety percent of the HIV infections are through sexual contacts.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone's Junta Declares Sanctions Illegal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's military junta,
which seized power in a coup in May has declared over the state
radio that "no country or organization has imposed legal
sanctions" against that country.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi and ECOMOG peace-keeping
force commander Major General Victor Malu "have no authority or
justification to unilaterally impose sanctions on the sovereign
people of Sierra Leone," a statement issued on Friday said.
</P>
<P>
"As a member of the international community, we have stressed
that the best method to help Sierra Leone in the crisis is to
allow or create a forum for peaceful negotiation and diplomacy,"
it said, quoted by a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)
announced "full-scale" embargo and sanctions against Sierra Leone
when peace talks collapsed after the junta said it would remain
in power until the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi and Malu "should concentrate on the legal sanctions
imposed on their country, Nigeria, by the United Nations Security
Council, and the Commonwealth, and leave the peaceful people of
Sierra Leone to their own problems," the statement noted.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, the major contributor of ECOMOG, has since 1995 been
suffering from sanctions imposed by some Western countries for
its reported human rights abuse. The Commonwealth suspended its
membership for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, Major Johnny Koroma, leader of the junta, made
his first trip outside the capital Freetown since the May 25
coup.
</P>
<P>
He visited the northern border town of Kambia, where some
2,000 civilians have sought refuge since the army seized power in
the coup.
</P>
<P>
Koroma, who flew to the town by helicopter, said he wanted to
have "first-hand knowledge" of the reportedly bad conditions
endured by civilians who fled the capital in fear of an attack by
ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
"I am very disturbed over their plight and we shall embark on
measures to return those who wish to go back" to Freetown, Koroma
was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Zambians Frown on Gap Between Borrowing, Lending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The participants at a just ended
international seminar have asked Zambia's central bank, the Bank
of Zambia to investigate cause of wide gap between borrowing and
lending rates in commercial banks of the country.
</P>
<P>
The participants of the meeting which ended here on Friday
said in view of the "unjustifiably big difference" between the
borrowing and lending rates, the Bank of Zambia should identify
what is behind the gap between the two.
</P>
<P>
Bank Governor Jacob Mwanza and his staff said the width of the
gap could not be justified by such economic indicators as the
rate of inflation.
</P>
<P>
Credit Africa Bank Chairman Z. Nizam tried to defend the gap
by pointing out that many factors are taken into consideration
before arriving at the current rates.
</P>
<P>
Nizam blamed the central bank for some of its demands on
commercial banks which, he claimed have contributed to the rates.
</P>
<P>
The participants noted that the high cost of borrowing is a
disincentive to the expansion of production in manufacturing and
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Local and foreign bankers, businessmen and representatives of
international organizations attended the three-day seminar with
the theme "from stabilization to growth and poverty alleviation".

<HEADLINE> Jordanian-Kuwaiti Ties Improving, Jordanian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAITI CITY, August 10 (Xinhua) --Jordanian-Kuwaiti relations,
which have been frozen since Iraq's 1990 invasion of the small
Gulf state, have begun to improve, a local newspaper quoted
Jordanian Foreign Minister Fayez Tarawneh as saying today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with local Arabic daily "Al-Seyassah" published
today, Tarawneh said, "there is a clear political will from both
sides and at the highest level to improve and strengthen the
bilateral relations."
</P>
<P>
He said that Jordan is fully prepared to restore normal ties
with Kuwait, however, he could not make any remarks on behalf of
Kuwait in this respect.
</P>
<P>
He added that time is the only factor in normalizing the
Jordanian-Kuwaiti ties and "we have to wait for a suitable
opportunity to restore full normal ties through appropriate ways."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait froze ties with Jordan, Yemen, Sudan and the Palestinian
authorities after they sided with Iraq during Iraqi seven-month
occupation of Kuwait and the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's embassy in Kuwait has been closed since 1990 and
Kuwait has a charge d'affaires in Amman.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Kuwait opened direct air links in July after Kuwaiti
Acting Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber
Al-Sabah said in June that normalization of ties with certain Arab
states, which had taken pro-Iraq position, would take place in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
However, Tawawneh said that the launch of full diplomatic
mission between the two countries has not been discussed yet.

<HEADLINE> Garden In Memory of Chinese Contribution Planned In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Initial stages of a
Chinese-style garden project in recognition of the contribution of
some 2,000 Chinese people to the founding of an Australian town is
expected to be completed within a year, its mayor said today.
</P>
<P>
Tony Hewson, mayor of Young, a town about two hours' drive from
Australia's national capital Canberra, said the project was
designed to remember the past and look forward to the future of
the town.
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 Chinese came to Lambing Flat (now the Town of
Young) as goldminers in the late 1850s and early 1860s and soon
became victims of two riots stirred by white goldminers targeting
them.
</P>
<P>
In 1861, European and North American miners rallied against the
Chinese miners. They marched and attacked the Chinese, killing
some and driving the rest off the gold fields, according to a
document provided by the town government.
</P>
<P>
The document described the riots as one of the most infamous
episodes in Australia's turbulent colonial history and the
progenitor of the "Immigration Restriction Act of 1901". The act
was the beginning of the "White Australia Policy", which
discriminated against non-white people and was not abolished until
the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Hewson said that the Young Shire Council in November 1996 moved
to dedicate gardens being constructed in "recognition of the
contribution of the Chinese people to the founding of Young in the
1860s and to their ongoing contributions to Australia as a
nation."
</P>
<P>
A foundation of Australians from all sides of politics, the
media and business community has been formed to assist the three
million Australian dollar (2.2 million US dollar) project.
</P>
<P>
The foundation will be launched at a fund-raising dinner in
Sydney on August 26, with former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam as a
special guest. The Whitlam government abolished the White
Australian Policy and it established diplomatic relations with
China in 1972.
</P>
<P>
Hewson, who is to leave on Tuesday for a visit to Lanzhou,
capital of northwest China's Gansu province to finalize a sister
city agreement between the two cities, told Xinhua that his town,
a wool and wheat producer with a population of about 15,000, hopes
to promote its economic relationship with Lanzhou.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Pledges to Extend Aid to DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is willing to
extend aid to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) on
humanitarian grounds to help the people there to overcome the food
problem, Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said here today.
</P>
<P>
Badawi said ideological and political differences are not
obstacles to Malaysia extending aid to the DPRK people who are
facing the problem of food shortages.
</P>
<P>
"We understand that their ideology is different from ours,
their political system is also different. But we do not want these
differences to stop us from giving assistance," he was quoted by
the Malaysian national news agency Bernama as telling reporters
after closing a youth seminar here.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said yesterday the
component parties of the ruling National Front were prepared to
jointly extend aid to the DPRK people.
</P>
<P>
He said the National Front had agreed to help because its
leaders really understood the problem.
</P>
<P>
Lauding the efforts of a local newspaper to raise funds for the
DPRK people, Badawi said his foreign ministry would announce
another form of assistance for the DPRK people soon.

<HEADLINE> South Korea, Japan to Resume Fishery Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 10 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and Japan will resume
talks on revising the bilateral fisheries agreement in Tokyo on
Tuesday, Foreign Ministry sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations are resumed prior to the settlement of the
disputes on recent Japanese seizures of South Korean fishing
boats, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Maritime Safety Agency (MSA) seized five South Korean
fishing boats in the past two months for violating "new
territorial waterlines," which were imposed by Japan unilaterally
and were not recognized by South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The seizure stalled the bilateral talks on fisheries agreement,
and the situation became more complicated when the returned Korean
crew accused the Japanese maritime authorities of manhandling them.
</P>
<P>
The fishery negotiations will be preceded by a bilateral
meeting scheduled on Tuesday to investigate the manhandling
allegations, and then go into working-level talks Wednesday and
Thursday on how to reestablish the two countries' territorial
fishing rights.
</P>
<P>
Seoul and Tokyo are negotiating a new fisheries accord but have
made no substantial progress because of a territorial dispute over
a small group of islands in the Sea of Japan, known as Tokto in
South Korea and Takeshima in Japan.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has been accusing Japan of violating international
law by drawing new waterlines, which expanded Japan's territorial
waters, without advance consultation with Seoul.
</P>
<P>
"Japan has put forth a tentative revision to the current
fisheries accord including the Tokto islets in the negotiation
process. However, we intend to exclude the islets' issue from our
negotiations," a South Korean Foreign Ministry official said.

<P>
ATHENS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Abel Anton of Spain outkicked his
compariot Martin Fiz in the final stage to win the men's marathon gold
medal on the last day of the 6th World Athletics Championships here
today.
</P>
<P>
Anton, 1994 European 10,000m champion, clocked two hours 13 minutes
16 seconds ahead of Fiz's 2:13:21, and Australia's Stephen
Moneghetti's 2:14:16.
</P>
<P>
Willy Kolumbo of Congo and Namibia'sLuketz Swartboi, the 1993 world
silver medal winner, led the field at the 15km point in 47:52.
Defending champion Fiz ran 11 seconds behind, at the head of the
remaining pack of 16 runners.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the halfway, the first group was trimmed to nine
runners including three Spaniards: Fiz, Fabian Roncero and Abel Anton.
Anton was a new face in the race and only turned to marathon from
5,000m and 10,000m two years ago.
</P>
<P>
After 35 kilometers, Fiz and Anton built up a 38-second lead over
Moneghetti, and increased their lead steadily in the next kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Anton didn't make his killing move until Panathinaikon stadium came
into sight. He accelerated to drop Fiz quickly and entered the stadium
with a healthy lead, waving to the crowd with a big smile.
</P>
<P>
The winner said after his win:"I am very happy to be the winner.
Fiz initially asked for my help, because he knows I am fast, in order
to speed up the race, but I told him I preferred to run the way I
liked and he understood.
</P>
<P>
"This was only my third marathon. I have no clear plans for the
future, I just hope to compete in the marathon in the Sydney
Olympics."

<HEADLINE> Kabila Calls on S. Africa to Expel Former Zairean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic Republic of
Congo has demanded that South Africa repatriate generals and
officials who stole hundreds of millions of Dollars from its
treasury and fled the country when it fell to rebels in May.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by Congoless Foreign Minister Bizima Karaha
in a statement issued last week on the eve of President Laurent
Kabila's first official visit to South Africa, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Karaha said the money was part of a total of between 822
million and 1.04 billion U.S. Dollars, which was estimated to
have been taken by the generals and officials fleeing Zaire for
their new homes in Europe and Africa.
</P>
<P>
He named three officials of ousted president Mobutu Sese Seko:
General Pama Baramoto, General Ngabanda Ayumba and General
Nzinbi, as being among those who should be sent home.
</P>
<P>
The generals are in South Africa illegally as their diplomatic
passports had been cancelled, the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
South African Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad said "all of
them would have been here on diplomatic passports."
</P>
<P>
But he said the government would not act until it had
completed an intelligence investigation to establish "on what
basis they are here".
</P>
<P>
Joe Nhlanhla, deputy minister of intelligence, told the press
yesterday the investigation was at an advanced stage and a report
would be given to President Nelson Mandela within a week.
</P>
<P>
South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo said: "We are
examining the issue and shall keep in close touch with the
Congolese government."

JINAN, August 10 (Xinhua) -- China's Shandong Province's GDP
has maintained an annual average increase of 100 billion yuan over
the past four years, and increased 11 percent during the first
half of this year over that of 1996.
</P>
<P>
It leads the country in industrial pre-tax profits, increase in
profit, and total output.
</P>
<P>
It had 12.76 billion yuan in local revenues, up 26 percent from
a year ago, with the increase in revenues for the past four years
exceeding the total for the previous 30 years combined.
</P>
<P>
This improved economic performance is mainly attributed to a
shift toward intensive operations. Shandong has 784 enterprise
groups, which have more than 130 billion yuan in assets and
produce nearly a quarter of the total sales and pre-tax profits of
the sector.
</P>
<P>
Shandong's annual spending on technological improvements has
been 10 percentage points more than for capital construction in
recent years, and over 2,000 developments are applied to
production every year, with new products contributing 10 percent
of total industrial output.
</P>
<P>
Shandong now sells half its products elsewhere, and has five of
the 19 state-recognized name-brand products.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Benefit From International Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Some 5,000 poor farmers in
Yiliang County, Yunnan Province, have seen improvements in their
lives in the past two years thanks to a poverty relief project
financed by the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The bank's Southwest China Poverty Relief Project started in
1995 in Yunnan and Guizhou provinces and the Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region with about 200 million US dollars in
low-interest loans.
</P>
<P>
Its purpose was to help develop agriculture, infrastructure,
township enterprises, education, public health, and labor force
exports of the three areas.
</P>
<P>
It is expected to help 90 percent of Yunnan's poor farmers have
better lives when it is completed in 2001.
</P>
<P>
China has 592 poor counties, 73 of which are in Yunnan. Farmers
there often don't have sufficient grain and food oil. Since the
mid-1980s, it has made a great effort to eradicate poverty and has
reduced the number of 250 million poor to 58 million at the end of
last year.
</P>
<P>
Beginning this year, the European Union and Germany will spend
31.7 million yuan on farmland, technology, drinking water,
economic, and environmental improvements in four of the province's
poor counties.

<HEADLINE> Australia Claims Gold Medal at Under-23 Basketball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Australia shut out Puerto
Rico's damaging three point shooters in the final to win the Men's
Under-23 World Basketball Championship title at Melbourne Park on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Australia, who led by eight points at halftime, took the gold
medal with an 88-73 victory before some 6,000 home spectators.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia snatched the bronze medal after an 84-72 win triumph
over Argentina in the playoff for third place.
</P>
<P>
Australia's victory was very much a team effort and due to some
brilliant defensive work by forward Simon Dwight and some accurate
shooting from the free-throw line and solid defensive work on the
guards by Aaron Trahair.
</P>
<P>
NBA bound Chris Anstey had little influence on the win which
made the victory even sweeter for the Australian side.
</P>
<P>
Anstey played less than five minutes in the first half after
chalking up three fouls and finished just eight minutes of court
time after fouling out with six minutes remaining when Australia
led by 10 points.
</P>
<P>
Trahair scored a team-high 18 points including 10 of 12 from
the free-throw line.
</P>
<P>
The Puerto Ricans, in an attempt to get back at the final few
minutes, continually fouled Trahair, who sunk eight of nine shots
from the free throw line over the last four minutes.
</P>
<P>
Dwight finished with five rebounds, but more importantly five
huge blocks.
</P>
<P>
Australia curbed Puerto Rico's damaging three point shooters,
Eddin Santiago, Carmello Travieso and Edgar Padilla by hustling
the trio when they had the ball and giving them little chance to
shoot.
</P>
<P>
Puerto Rico was undefeated in this tournament coming into the
final. It knocked off the United States in a preliminary round and
Yugoslavia in the semifinal.
</P>
<P>
In day's other playoff games, the United States edged Turkey
61-58 to take fifth, Spain defeated Lithuania 81-72 to place
seventh, South Korea beat Egypt 78-62 for ninth, while New Zealand
trounced China 85-66 for 11th.

<HEADLINE> Carrier Pigeon Returns From Hong Kong To Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, August 10 (Xinhua) -- On the day Hong Kong was
returned, hundreds of thousands of carrier pigeons selected from
different places in the mainland were let out at a Hong Kong
stadium in drizzling weather for the difficult long trek back home.
</P>
<P>
One of them let out on July 1 has returned to its Harbin home,
some 3,000 kilometers away in northeast China's Heilongjiang
Province after a month of some very hard flying.
</P>
<P>
On August 4, Chi Bingsheng, an orthopaedist and owner of the
pigeon, opened the cage as usual to feed his pigeons, but could
hardly believe his eyes when he saw the yellow-eyed grey pigeon
which had gone to Hong Kong more than a month before.
</P>
<P>
"I thought it might die on the way back," said Chi. But the
number on the band on the pigeon's leg was still legible. The
Harbin Carrier Pigeon Association testified to the fact that the
pigeon really made the voyage.
</P>
<P>
Chi's pigeon is the only one of 174 pigeons selected from
Harbin to have returned. Chi told Xinhua that the third toe of its
left foot had been fractured on the way back, but that it had
healed itself miraculously.

<HEADLINE> Scholars Study Relations between Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, August 10 (Xinhua) -- More than 60 scholars from China
and the Republic of Korea met early this month to look at the
relations between Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism in Xianyang
City in northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Confucianism and Taoism originated in China and spread to East
and South Asia, whereas Buddhism came from its birthplace in India
to China, then on to the Korean Peninsula and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The three have influenced the spirit, culture, science, and
technology of Asian people in ways that make Eastern culture
vastly different from Western culture.
</P>
<P>
Many scholars have said that Confucianism, Taoism, and
Buddhism, which are seen as the core of Eastern culture, have
played a very great role in shaping the unique cultures of the
three countries.
</P>
<P>
"By studying Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism, Chinese and
foreign scholars can explore the cultural treasure-house of China,
Japan and Korea," said Yang Xueyi, Vice President of Shaanxi
Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Two Japanese experts were invited to give presentations at
the seminar, which was sponsored by the Chinese Academy of

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Today is the last day of a
two-day seminar where participants from Hong Kong and the inland
areas expressed their views on the "one country, two systems"
principle, Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, and China's
scientific, educational and economic development in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
Tang Xifang, a scholar from the National Science Foundation,
said at the seminar, which is jointly sponsored by the All-china
Students' Federation and the Western Returned Students'
Association that scientific and technical strength and
competitiveness are the main factors in long-term stability of
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He said that the inland area and Hong Kong have their own
advantages and characteristics for co-operation and that the
National Science Foundation has done much for scientific and
technical exchanges and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Eddy S.H. Li, president of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade
Association spoke on how the inland areas could influence Hong
Kong if China participates in the World Trade Organization and
have a positive effect on Hong Kong's economic development in
trade, manufacturing, and service industries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the development of the information industry in Hong
Kong and the inland area, Xue Lan, of the Academy for the 21st
Century at Qinghua University, said there is lots of room for
co-operation since the inland area has a large labor force and
many intellectuals, while Hong Kong, which is good at technical
exploration and applications, has much-needed capital, and
management expertise.
</P>
<P>
He said that co-operation is going smoothly and suggested that
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government play
a more positive role in formulating and co-ordinating the
development of the information industry, and encourage the people
of Hong Kong to participate in national science projects.

<P>
BEIDAIHE, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng, meeting today
with members of a national conference, said that the economic
growth mode must be transformed so that it's market-oriented to
maintain healthy economic growth.
</P>
<P>
To meet this goal, Li said, the first thing is the rational
allocation of resources and avoiding repeated investment in major
projects.
</P>
<P>
He said great effort must be made in reducing production costs
to make more competitive products, and that the country should
stress on technical upgrading of enterprises instead of engaging
in starting new and big projects,
</P>
<P>
Factories should guarantee that new products will sell well in
the markets before spending on technical upgrading to refrain from
blindly expanding production capacity.
</P>
<P>
Li said that regional barriers should be removed in
establishing enterprise groups by mergers, combination or the use
of bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
China has great potential in rural markets and lots of areas
remained to be tapped in urban markets, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li also called for building more inexpensive housing for urban
dwellers while enhancing the pace of the country's housing reform.

<HEADLINE> Nigerians Enjoined to Invest in Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian businessmen have been
urged to explore investment opportunities in Liberia which is
facing daunting reconstruction work after seven years of bitter
civil war.
</P>
<P>
Since Liberia is very safe now, it would be fool-hardy for
Nigerians to shun investing in the country, said Major-general
Victor Malu, commander of the west African peacekeeping force
(ECOMOG).
</P>
<P>
In his paper presented at a workshop of Vision 2010, Nigeria's
medium-term development blueprint on the drawing table, Malu
listed other advantages for investors apart from the sound
security situation in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
According to Malu, Lebanese are the owners of flourishing
supermarkets in Liberia, which maintains an impressive
import-oriented economy. This indicated opportunities for
Nigerian exporters.
</P>
<P>
Liberia is also endowed with rich natural resources, including
timber, rubber, iron ore and very fertile land for agricultural
produce, he added.

Describing the country as one where those who governed it took
what they desired and went to other lands, especially America,
Malu said more opportunities are there in the construction of
infrastructure facilities.

<HEADLINE> China's Computer Market Summer Gains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 10 (Xinhua) -- China's personal computer (PC)
market maintained its rapid growth since the beginning of this
year, with 650,000 produced during the first six months, up 27.5
percent from the same period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The July figure is expected to be more than 120,000. The
profitable market has resulted in more intense competition.
</P>
<P>
Hewlett-Packard, held a large trade show, "HP World '97" in
Beijing on July 24, to show its latest computer technology at the
biggest computer exhibition in China this summer.
</P>
<P>
A HP representative said that the company, which achieved an
80-percent increase in computer business in China during fiscal
year 1996-1997, is working to further expand its presence in China.
</P>
<P>
Another US computer giant, IBM, donated 32 million US dollars
worth of large computer servers to four major Chinese universities
on July 31, which underlines its long-term development commitment
in China, and its desire to win over more IBM customers in China's
universities, say industrial analysts here.
</P>
<P>
Seagate, the global leader in hard discs, opened its brand-new
computer interface, Ultra ATA, to increase data transmission
capacity and stability of computer by a big margin. This move
will throw the computer companies into a new round of technology
competition.
</P>
<P>
In response to pressure from foreign rivals, Chinese PC makers
resorted to a price war this summer. Legend Group, the country's
biggest PC firm, has held 12 percent of the domestic market shares
by taking the lead in slashing computer prices.
</P>
<P>
Domestic companies like Legend and Founder have offered
portable computer brands, breaking the foreign stranglehold on
laptops for price advantages.

<HEADLINE> Over 2,600 Tamil Rebels Killed In Sri Lanka This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka government troops have
killed more than 2,600 Tamil rebels this year, as the army is
continuing operations to retake rebel-controlled areas in north
Sri Lanka, the Defense Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
According to incomplete figures released by the ministry, 2,664
rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) have been
killed and 1,889 others wounded.
</P>
<P>
There were a large number of rebels' battlefield deaths
unaccounted for as the bodies have not been found. The LTTE
usually carries away its dead to cover up its losses, the ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the government side has lost 616 soldiers and
843 others were wounded.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, the troops have also recovered a large
haul of arms, ammunition and explosives.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have been fighting a 14-year-old war for an
independent homeland for minority Tamils in the country's north
and east. The government says over 55,000 people have been killed
in the conflict.

<HEADLINE> Critical Shortage of Judges Hits Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has been hit by a
critical shortage of judges and magistrates that some cases have
had to be adjourned for over a year before they can be heard,
according to Sunday Times of Zambia today.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper reported that some magistrates are also
being circulated around the districts to help clear the backlog.
</P>
<P>
Out of an establishment of 30 state high court judges across
the country, there are only 14 sitting, while only three
principal magistrates out of an establishment of 10 are
available.
</P>
<P>
There are six senior resident magistrates serving out of a
requirement of 15.
</P>
<P>
The situation is said to be so bad that in some cases local
court justices are being used to hear complex cases which have
been referred to higher courts.
</P>
<P>
It quoted acting chief administrator in the Judicial
Department Philip Musonda as saying that "the situation in the
judiciary is very bad, we have very few professional magistrates
and judges to go around and quickly dispense court cases and
unless something is done soon, we will end up in very big
trouble."
</P>
<P>
He said countries in the sub-region for the same jobs are
paying very high salaries while their Zambian counterparts has
remained static.
</P>
<P>
"The judiciary has not been spared by the brain drain due to
low salaries," he said.

<HEADLINE> India to Tap Methane as Substitute for Natural Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government has
chalked out an ambitious plan to tap the potential of coal bed
methane (cbm) gas which could become a major substitute for
natural gas, the Press Trust of India reported today.
</P>
<P>
India is estimated to have about one trillion cubic meters of
cbm and if exploited "properly and adequately," it could help
reduce oil demand which has already crossed 60 million tons
annually, official sources said here.
</P>
<P>
However, the reduction in oil demand would depend upon the
extent of substitution the country was able to effect when the
production of cbm starts commercially, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, the state-owned Oil and Natural Gas
Commission has acquired seismic data and drilled two wells for cbm
exploration in West Bengal. Another location has recently been
taken up for drilling.
</P>
<P>
To realize the vast potential of coal-based methane, the Indian
government recently approved a new policy for its exploration and
exploitation which included specific incentives to investors, the
sources said.

United States 14-16, 15-6, 15-13, 12-15, 15-7. With the win, Italy
took third after two consecutive losses.
</P>
<P>
With all their ace players on the court, the Russian-Chinese
clash Sunday brought the three-day event to its climate.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese got an initial 7-3 lead in the opening set. But
that did not last long as the Russians obtained one point by
another to catch up. After the scores tied three times, the
Russians took the upper hand at 9-8. The Chinese failed to even
the score and finally lost the set 10-15.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese seemed to have no definite means in front of sharp
smashes launched by 1.90-meter tall spikers Evgenia Artamonova and
Elena Godina.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese won the second set 15-10 but lost the two following
sets in a row.
</P>
<P>
Lang Ping, head coach of the Chinese team, praised her three
newcomers, saying that they played to their form in the tough game.
</P>
<P>
She said that her team, although improved since its formation
in June, needs more time and competitions to become more
experienced and skillful.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Defense Minister Meets with US Senate Pro Tempore President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIDAIHE, Hebei, August 10 (Xinhua) -- General Chi Haotian,
vice-chairman of the Chinese Central Military Commission (CMC),
met with Strom Thurmond, president pro tempore of the Senate of
the United States, here today.
</P>
<P>
Chi, who is also state councilor and defense minister, said
that in spite of some twists and turns in Sino-US relations, the
trend for development has maintained a positive and forward
momentum.
</P>
<P>
"We are delighted to see some relatively big progress in the
the relations between the two countries and their armed forces
thanks to the joint efforts of both sides," he said.
</P>
<P>
China is the biggest developing country in the world while the
United States is the largest developed country, Chi noted. The
establishment of a long-term stable, friendly and cooperative
ties between the two countries not only conforms to the
fundamental interests of the two peoples, but is of great
significance to the maintenance of peace and stability of the
region and in the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the three joint communiques issued by China and the
US laid the basis of the relations between the two countries, he
expressed the hope that both sides will abide by the principles
enshrined in the three joint communiques and continue to advance
the relations between the two countries and their armed forces
toward a still more positive direction.
</P>
<P>
Thurmond said that the visit has left him and his party a deep
impression of the Chinese people and army. The US wishes to
further increase its dialogues with China in the field of security
to promote exchanges and cooperation between the armed forces of
the two countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
Thurmond and his party have come to visit China as guests of
the Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress.

<HEADLINE> UK Government Attacked for Lengthened Hospital Queues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Waiting lists in National Health
Service hospitals are set to rise sharply over the next year
despite Labor's election promise of swifter patient treatment.
</P>
<P>
It could drive hospital waiting lists up by as much as 360,000
over the next two years, according to the calculations based on
the Government's Budget forecasts.
</P>
<P>
Chantrey Vellacott (CV), an accounting firm, said waiting lists
are set to rise by as many as 500 patients a day until the middle
of 1999 unless spending is increased.
</P>
<P>
This has brought criticism to the Labor government.
</P>
<P>
The Liberal Democrats said that before election, hardly a day
went by without Labor highlighting the problem of growing waiting
lists. One of the Government's key manifesto pledges was to take
100,000 people off waiting lists.
</P>
<P>
Simon Hughes, Liberal Democrat health spokesman, said, "The
harsh reality is that under Labor, waiting lists are set to get
longer."
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Alan Milburn admitted that waiting lists will
get longer in 44 of the 100 health authorities in England and
shorter in only four.
</P>
<P>
Among them, almost half the health authorities in England have
discreetly altered their contractual arrangements to allow for
longer waiting times.
</P>
<P>
South Essex, West Herts and West Sussex have told hospitals to
keep within maximum waiting times of 18 months in 1997-98,
compared with a maximum of 12 months last year.
</P>
<P>
The CV report also warned of other unaccounted costs, including
three billion pounds (4.8 billion U.S. dollars) of negligence
claims and the cost of changing the date in computers at the
millennium.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Criticizes West Democracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 10 (Xinhua) --- Zimbabwean president Robert
Mugabe said that the west could not teach Africa or Zimbabwe
about democracy, the Sunday Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the newspaper, Mugabe said, "we
cannot get our lessons on democracy from the west, because the
west has been the worst teacher in practical terms to us. When
they were here as colonisers they never thought of protecting us
from oppression, discrimination, racism, poverty, hunger and
disease."
</P>
<P>
"So how can oppressors and racists now become our teachers on
democracy?" Mugabe asked.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the opening up and liberalisation of economy,
the president said although the government had liberalised to
competition, it was a fact that this competition was not an even
process.
</P>
<P>
He said, "the majority have nothing to compete with, while
others have wealth already. They have somewhere on which to
stand but the majority of the people are poor and do not have
skills. But it will take time for the majority of the people to
thrive."
</P>
<P>
"But it's coming and we are glad that the programme of
education we adopted since independence has yielded good results.
But much more still needs to be done, training of our people and
exposing our people to the need to take up challenges," he said.
</P>
<P>
Still on the issue of the economy, Mugabe said the government
had to guard against the seizure of the economy by a few, whether
they be white, black or yellow".

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thailand Rushes Schemes to Check Deposit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government last Tuesday
announced the suspension of operations of 42 more finance firms,
triggering heavy withdrawals of deposits nationwide by customers,
who are shifting their money to safer banks.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government's radical measure, introduced as part of
its package designed to win aid from the International Monetary
Fund (IMF), did shake local finance institutions, especially those
small or unhealthy ones, over the past days. The government now
has to enforce schemes to reassure depositors.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the liquidity fund and the deposit insurance fund
under the Financial Institutions Development Fund were put in
place by the government to offset the effects of heavy
withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
The liquidity fund will channel money from companies with
excess liquidity back to the institutions short of cash, while the
deposit insurance fund will guarantee money placed with the
country's 33 finance firms still in operation and the 15
commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand, the central bank in the country, has
required the 48 healthy Thai financial institutions and 19 foreign
bank branches in Thailand to participate in the liquidity fund,
saying the fund was essential to prevent some financial
institutions from collapsing.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has so far suspended operations of 58 finance firms in
the country, including 16 closed on July 27. The action sparked
worries that some small commercial banks were likely in trouble
and ensuing panic withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
The Thai central bank has been injecting limited funds into
those banks negatively affected, while pledging to normalize the
situation.
</P>
<P>
Foreign banks apparently have seen their deposits soar during
the panic withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
But analysts said that no banks are winners as they have to
bear higher costs for interest payments and lend nearly half of
the deposits gained during the period to the liquidity fund.
</P>
<P>
As for the deposit insurance fund, which is introduced to
provide long-term and unconditional guarantees for depositors and
creditors, it will be responsible for payment within 30 days of
the default when any of Thailand's currently 48 healthy banks and
finance firms is unable to repay deposits or loans.
</P>
<P>
Operating funds for the scheme would be raised by issuing debt
instruments locally and abroad and guaranteed by the Finance
Ministry, Thai central bank officials said.
</P>
<P>
The development fund could recall its money from the financial
institutions later, they added.
</P>
<P>
The Thai central bank hoped that the two fund schemes will help
bring the situation to normal after one month.

<HEADLINE> Countrywide Crackdown on Lawlessness Ordered in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Police Commissioner
Duncan Wachira has ordered a countrywide crackdown on all forms
of lawlessness and launched a major manhunt for the killers of
two police officers.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here on Saturday, the police boss said
that all acts of lawlessness would be met with the full force of
the law and he had directed his men to deal "firmly" with anyone
involved in lawless activities.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday part of the crowd attending the pro-reforms rally
at Central Park in Nairobi lynched Special Branch constable
Gilbert Akhanya Simiyu.
</P>
<P>
The second policeman was driving to his Wangige home when a
rowdy crowd hit his car with stones and was killed when his car
landed in a ditch where the killers followed him with more
stones.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi yesterday condemned the
killing of two policemen by pro-reform demonstrators last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Wachira noted that "we have launched immediate investigation
on those involved in the killing" and "we will do everything
within its powers" to apprehend the perpetrators of the two
killings together with that of the civilian in Korogocho area.
</P>
<P>
The police boss gave a run down of events that indicated the
deterioration of peace and security in the east African country
starting on May 31.
</P>
<P>
During the unlicensed pro-reforms rally on May 31, 21 police
officers were injured while on duty and 58 shops looted, two
vehicles set ablaze and one damaged.
</P>
<P>
On June 19, pro-reforms activists tried to disrupt
parliamentary business leaving two police officers injured while
on July 7, 13 people died, 19 shops were damaged and looted, two
motor vehicles burnt and 15 others were damaged.
</P>
<P>
The National Convention Executive Committee, the convener of
the Friday meeting, and the National Council of Churches of
Kenya, also spoke against the violence.

<HEADLINE> Maturer Macro-control Policy Boosts China Economy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The third-generation leadership
of Communist Party of China (CPC) with General Secretary Jiang
Zemin at the core displayed a still maturer macro-control ability
over the country's once overheated economy, and achieved a sound
economic growth in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Holding high the banner of Deng Xiaoping's theory on building
socialism with Chinese characteristics, the CPC leadership and
State Council, China's cabinet, ushered the national economy into
the best phase since the founding of new China by timely resorting
to macro-control methods, and has been highly acclaimed by
economists both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
China kicked off the macrocontrol drive in June 1993, when the
State Council issued a collection of decrees on readjusting the
macro-economic operation. The drive began with the
re-establishment of a financial order, and then extended to more
economic sectors with the focus fixed on inflation control.
</P>
<P>
The economic overheat appeared in China following the rocketing
GDP growth in 1992, featuring the unsaddled investing tide,
disorder in financial sector and an excessive money supply. As a
result, the country's inflation rate soared to a dangerous level
of 21.7 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, thanks to the prompt macrocontrol by the central
government, the inflation rate was cut down by a big margin, while
the national economy still recorded a rapid growth.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese economists, the macro-control move, which
was aimed at achieving an economic model featuring "high growth,
low inflation," is one of the most successful in China's history,
though it had been confronted with the most rigorous challenge
ever emerged here.
</P>
<P>
Blessing the inflation control with top priority in the
macro-control drive, the Chinese government implemented an
"appropriately tight monetary policy" in accordance with the
requirement to striking at a basic balance between the total social
demancd and total supply, to cut down the investment in fixed
assets, and to lower the excessive market demand to a rational
level.

<HEADLINE> Maturer Macro-Control Policy Boosts China's Economy (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the Chinese government firmly adhered to a moderately tight
fiscal and money policy, the country's money supply decreased to
91.7 billion yuan in 1996 from the 152.7 billion yuan in 1993, and
the growth in fixed assets investment slowed down to 18.2 percent
from the 58.6 percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Although the moderately tight money policy resulted in capital
shortages for the enterprises in a short run, the central
government was undaunted by temporary difficulties and kept to the
moderately tight money policy in a flexible way, which finally
brought the runaway inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
Its efforts to strengthen the agriculture also yielded a steady
growth in the sector, thereby providing the most important
foundation to effectively curb inflation while a sustained
and rapid economic growth was brought about.
</P>
<P>
A salient feature of the government's macro-economic control
since 1993 was that the government made full use of various
market-oriented economic leverages of price, tax, credit, interest
rate, and exchange rate to achieve its macro-control target.
</P>
<P>
As a result, most commodity prices, which used to be set by the
state government, now move in line with market supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
And all kinds of markets have taken shape, including financial
market, market of technology and information, and labor market.
The capital market, namely bond market, stock market and futures
market, also began to ride on a sound development track.
</P>
<P>
The country's enterprises were also taught to be market-aware
and produce in accordance with market demand. And more capital was
injected into the construction and improvement of infrastructure
facilities, basic industries and backbone industries to ensure a
sustained economic progress and realize a concerted development
between the economy and society.

<P>
The government also attached adequate importance to the
monitoring, analyzing and forecasting of the macro-economic
situation, so as to make timely minor adjustments in its
macro-control policy and achieve the best results.
</P>
<P>
This was best reflected in its adjustment of the financial
policy during the past four years. In face of over-supply of
currency and runaway inflation in 1993, the central bank raised
the interest rates of bank deposits and loans, so as to restrain
the surging demand for capital.
</P>
<P>
But the central bank promptly suspended the
inflation-subsidized deposits and twice lowered the interest rates
of bank deposits and lendings, when the inflationary pressure was
alleviated and the commodity prices lowered to controllable level.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the central bank eased the control over bank credit,
in a bid to ensure sufficient capital for purchasing farming
products, encouraging good-performing enterprises to export more
goods, financing key building projects, and supporting the
nationwide economic readjustment drive.
</P>
<P>
All these measures have contributed substantially to a
sustained, rapid and sound development of the national economy,
said economists.

<P>
SHENYANG, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The vegetable seed strains

<HEADLINE> Indian National Congress Opposes Military Dominance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CALCUTTA (India), August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Indian National
Congress has reiterated the country's foreign policy of
Non-alignment, opposing military dominance over the world.
</P>
<P>
The Congress said in its international resolution adopted at
the end of its 80th plenary session here today that the emerging
trends in the Post-Cold War era have validated India's philosophy
and principles of Non-alignment.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the collapse of one of the two military blocs, there
is a persistent endeavor to extend the reach and strength of the
remaining military bloc. This search for military dominance is
accompanied by the maintenance and even aggravation of economic
inequalities. Political structures, biased in favor of a few, are
sought to be reinforced," the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
"The promise of a truly new international order has not been
realized because the end of the Cold War has not been seized upon
as an opportunity to promote equity in international relations.
Instead, the quest for dominance has continued relentlessly," it
said.
</P>
<P>
"The principles of peaceful coexistence constitute our code for
the conduct of international relations. It is the only way we can
fashion countervailing strategies to the quest for dominance," it
further said.
</P>
<P>
In its resolution, the Congress welcomed the dialogue between
India and Pakistan and urged the two governments to take concrete
steps towards the facilitation of good neighborly relations and
people-to-people contacts.
</P>
<P>
The Congress also welcomed the significant improvement in
relations with other South Asian neighbors of Nepal, Bangladesh,
Sri Lanka and Bhutan.
</P>
<P>
Turning to Sino-Indian relations, the resolution praised its
leaders and late Indian prime ministers Indira Gandhi and Rajiv
Gandhi for their contribution to improving the two countries'
relations and expressed its readiness to continue the dialogue to
bridge the remaining gaps between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"Peace, cooperation and progress in Asia depends in substantial
measure on the relationship between the two Asian giants, India
and China," it said.
</P>
<P>
In its three day plenary session, the Indian National Congress
also adopted political and economic resolutions reaffirming its
support to economic reforms in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Congress, formed in 1885, has led India to independence of
long-standing British colonial rule in 1947 and has given
single-party governance to it for close on 45 of the last 50
years.

<P>
HAIKOU, August 10 (Xinhua) -- This capital of the southernmost
Hainan province has seen a steady growth of local industries in
the first half of this year, following two years' fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
The city's economic growth somewhat declined two years ago,
after the central government adopted a tight financial policy that
affected its unsteady economy.
</P>
<P>
Over-speculations in real estate sector effected negatively on
local economy, and slowed down the city's pace for industrial
development, official sources say.
</P>
<P>
"However, the city has managed to overcome the speculations in
real estate sector," the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Recent breakdowns show that the city's product to sales ratio
climbed up to 96.5 percent in the first six months of this year,
and the profits made by local industrial enterprises have also
increased by 33.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate of industrial output value in Haikou has
reached the national average, and nearly all the state-owned
enterprises are expected to make profits next year, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, they added, Haikou started in 1996 to have the
money-lossing state-owned enterprises announce bankruptcy, merger,
or be reshaped into share-holding companies, which enabled itself
to focus on developing high-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
Partly resultant from the measures the city has taken to
reshape its industrial structure, the investment in fixed assets
and basic industries have increased since the beginning of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Haikou approved 65 additional new foreign-funded
enterprises in the first six months, and the overseas investment
the city had actually put to use during the period came to 130
million US dollars.

industries in the first half of this year, following two years'
fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
The city's economic growth somewhat declined two years ago,
after the central government adopted a tight financial policy that
affected its unsteady economy.
</P>
<P>
Over-speculations in real estate sector effected negatively on
local economy, and slowed down the city's pace for industrial
development, official sources say.
</P>
<P>
"However, the city has managed to overcome the speculations in
real estate sector," the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Recent breakdowns show that the city's product to sales ratio
climbed up to 96.5 percent in the first six months of this year,
and the profits made by local industrial enterprises have also
increased by 33.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate of industrial output value in Haikou has
reached the national average, and nearly all the state-owned
enterprises are expected to make profits next year, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, they added, Haikou started in 1996 to have the
money-lossing state-owned enterprises announce bankruptcy, merger,
or be reshaped into share-holding companies, which enabled itself
to focus on developing high-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
Partly resultant from the measures the city has taken to
reshape its industrial structure, the investment in fixed assets
and basic industries have increased since the beginning of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Haikou approved 65 additional new foreign-funded
enterprises in the first six months, and the overseas investment
the city had actually put to use during the period came to 130
million US dollars.

<HEADLINE> UPS Breaks Off Talks with Striking Teamsters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The Teamsters union and the
United Parcel Service (UPS) broke off federal mediated talks
today, but both sides expressed their wish to end the six-day-old
strike that involves 185,000 union members throughout the nation.
</P>
<P>
White House officials have met with federal mediators to assess
the state of negotiations, which broke off two hours after
start. No new talks have been scheduled but the two sides agreed
to maintain contact with the mediator.
</P>
<P>
UPS spokesman Mark Dickens said the company concluded
discussions today at 2 p.m. EDT because "the demands of the union
would've made it impossible for UPS to serve its customers."
</P>
<P>
Teamsters spokesman Matt Witt said, "It's clear at this point,
they're (UPS) not interested in an agreement that provides
full-time jobs, secure pensions and promotional opportunities
within the company."
</P>
<P>
Witt said the union is ready and willing to go back to the
negotiating table at anytime.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Labor Secretary Alexis M. Herman said in a statement,
"We're disappointed the parties were unable to resolve their
differences," adding, "We continue to urge both parties to show
flexibility and a willingness to compromise to end this strike."
</P>
<P>
The strike focuses on two issues: the company's demand to
withdraw from the Teamsters' multi-employer pension plan and the
union's call to convert thousands of part-time jobs into full-time
ones.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-eight percent of UPS employees work part time, and there
hasn't been an increase in their base wage of eight dollars an
hour since 1982.

<HEADLINE> Brunei Stops Recruiting Nepali Gurkhas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The government of Brunei has
decided to stop recruiting former British Gurkha army officers
into its security unit, Nepali newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
Eleven Gurkha officers have also been expelled from the Gurkha
Reserve Unit (GRU) in Brunei for acting against army discipline,
the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, all the Nepali officers working in the GRU, who have
in the past been given major security responsibility, have been
disarmed as a form of punishment, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Nepal Ex-Army Association (NEAA) attributed the sudden and
unexpected decisions of Brunei to the acts of indiscipline against
the British government by some Gurkha officers in the GRU.
</P>
<P>
The Gurkha Ex-Army Association formed a group within the GRU
and started raising money in the name of fighting a case against
the British government, the reports quoted NEAA chairman Major
Deepak Gurung as telling a press conference Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Nepalese who served in the British Gurkha Army have been
demanding from the British government equal pension as being
enjoyed by their British counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed in 1947 between Britain, India and
Nepal, Nepali Gurkhas are allowed to serve in the British and
Indian armies.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Researchers of Thailand's
Mahidol University have invented a new device to measure the
iodine content of salt, according to a report available here
today.
</P>
<P>
The device, called I-kit, contains a solution, which, when
mixed with salt, will show a different tone of color depending on
the iodine content of salt.
</P>
<P>
The device can measure the iodine content between 0 to 100
units per million (UPM), the researchers said in the report.
</P>
<P>
A half of salt sample, even those labeled as iodine salt, taken
in the country, has been found to have iodine content lower than
the standard set at 30 UPM, they noted.
</P>
<P>
The new device will be beneficial to people in remote areas who
suffer from iodine deficiency disease, they added.
</P>
<P>
The I-kit reportedly will be distributed to local salt
manufacturers free of charge in a scientific week fair to be held
in Thailand on August 18-24.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Cut Aid to Other Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is expected to trim its
aid grants and technical assistance to other developing countries
next year due to the country's economic downturn, a senior Thai
official said recently.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government has adjusted the budget for the Thai
International Cooperation Program (TICP) for the 1998 fiscal year
from 582 million baht (19.4 million U.S. dollars) to 337 million
baht (11.2 million dollars), said Pichet Soontornpipit, head of
the Department of Technical and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The official hoped that the House of Representatives will not
further cut the adjustment budget when it reviews the budget.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government has a duty to honor its commitment to the
TICP, also known as Thai aid, which has been an effective
instrument in promoting Thailand's national interests and its
relations with other countries, Pichet said.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said that Thailand currently provides
assistance to 67 countries in Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe and
Latin America under its TICP program, which focuses on training
and study courses in agriculture, public health and education.
</P>
<P>
Despite the overall budget cut, technical assistance extended
by Thailand to Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam, which accounts
for up to 70 percent of Thailand's TICP budget, will not be
affected, Pichet said.

-- An article to review the macro-control achievements of the
Chinese government since 1993 hit the headline of the newspaper.
The article is divided into three parts, which respectively dealt with
the introduction of a series of reform policies in face of an
overheated economy in 1993, the government's effective rein on the
surging inflation and the impetus a socialist market economy gave
to the formation of a complete macro-control system.
</P>
<P>
-- The newspaper carried the full text of Regulations on
Building Educational Establishments by All Social Sectors. These
regulations state that educational institutions founded by various
social sectors, namely enterprises, institutions, people's
organizations and individual citizens, are components of the
socialist educational cause and should be encouraged by
governments at all levels. The 60-article regulations will take
effect on October 1.

<P>
-- The headline story of its Business Weekly today was about
the necessity of keeping a stable gold reserve in China. The

follow Europe and Australia by dumping gold because it needs to
maintain a stable reserve, and as a developing country it has to
keep a stable gold reserve for emergency use and to keep a balance
of international payment.

<P>
-- Moreover, the leading English newspaper today began a series
of byline reports by Liu Su, an official of the Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation, to clear fears that

<HEADLINE> Thailand, Vietnam Inks Sea Boundary Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and Vietnam concluded a
maritime boundary demarcation agreement here on Saturday, ending
more than two decades of boundary disputes in the Gulf of
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The pact to delimit some 6,500 square kilometers of overlapping
maritime claims was signed by Thai Foreign Minister Prachuab
Chaiyasarn and visiting Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh
Cam at the Government House late Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
The two sides hailed the agreement as a positive step for the
two countries, stressing it will promote peace, stability and
economic development in the region, local newspapers said today.
</P>
<P>
Prachuab noted that the pact signed marked a transition from
conflict to joint cooperation in the exploitation of natural
resources and security at sea.
</P>
<P>
Cam also indicated that the agreement is a big leap forward in
diplomatic relations between the two countries and reflected the
two countries' political will and determination to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam reportedly claimed its sovereignty over the sea area
more than 20 years ago and two years later Thailand filed its own
claims.
</P>
<P>
The two countries started negotiations on the disputed area in
1992 but the talks suspended in 1995 due to their differences in
how to use Tho Chu island, which is located about 80 nautical
miles from Vietnam's coast.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the new agreement will facilitate the two
countries to jointly develop oil and gas resources in the area and
enhance cooperation on joint naval patrol and fishery survey
there.
</P>
<P>
Thailand and Vietnam are also expected to hold a tripartite
meeting with Malaysia over a tiny overlapping area after the
conclusion of their demarcation deal.
</P>
<P>
Cam arrived here on Saturday on a two-day visit to Thailand and
he will fly to Singapore on Monday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoy Urges to Keep Karadzic Out of Politics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke to
Bosnia said today that he had won a promise that former Bosnian
Serb leader Radovan Karadzic would stay out of politics.
</P>
<P>
The announcement followed two days of tense talks between
Holbrooke, another U.S. envoy Robert Gelbard, Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and the Serb member of Bosnia's joint
presidency, Momcilo Krajisnik.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke said that Krajisnik "offered a unilateral
undertaking" that the agreement reached in July last year would be
respected.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, negotiated by Holbrooke and signed by Krajisnik,
Karadzic and Milosevic, stipulates that Karadzic disappear from
public life.
</P>
<P>
But Karadizic, who was twice indicted by the U.N. court for
crimes against humanity and genocide, is believed to have violated
his pledge and remains involved with public affairs.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic has previously proposed that the court transfer his
case and those of other Bosnian Serbs to the Bosnian Serb courts
for a U.N. supervised but Serb-run trial.
</P>
<P>
This is described as being unacceptable by Holbrooke, who
insists that all war criminals face justice in the
International Criminal Tribunal in the Hague.

<HEADLINE> China's Chemical Fiber Industry in Need of Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 10 (Xinhua) -- China's chemical fiber industry
needs comprehensive and timely restructuring to become more
competitive, said Ren Chuanjun, vice-chairman of China National
Textile Council.
</P>
<P>
China's chemical fiber industry, has developed explosively but
has serious problems that urgently need to be addressed, Ren said.
</P>
<P>
First, the development of raw material should be accelerated.
it cannot catch up with the development of chemical fiber, leaving
one third of the demand to the international market.
</P>
<P>
Second, most of China's chemical fiver enterprises are small so
they cannot achieve an economy of scale and have no ability to
develop new products. Many cannot compete and are losing money.
</P>
<P>
China has more than 700 chemical fiber manufacturers, but only
five have the ability to produce more than 100,000 tons annually,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The industry should be restructured also because of
unreasonable capital structure and product make-up.
</P>
<P>
Chemical fiber enterprises are operating under high
assets-liability rate. The average assets-liability rate of
chemical fiber enterprises is as high as 80 percent; some even 100
percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, most products are medium and low-end, while few are
high-tech.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming industrial restructuring will increase
development of chemical fiber raw materials and hopes to
self-supply 80 percent of the raw materials after five to 10
years, up from the present 65 percent.
</P>
<P>
The state will support the construction of 20 chemical fiver
manufacturing bases. To achieve the goal, the Chinese government
encourages large enterprises to acquire small ones, and encourage
cooperation among large enterprise groups.
</P>
<P>
China produced 3.34 million tons of chemical fiver in 1996, up
15 percent from 1995. Meanwhile, it imported 1.64 million tons of
chemical fiber to meet domestic market demand.

<HEADLINE> Healthy Industry Growth Expected to Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' industry is
expected to increase by 9.5 percent in the second half of this
year despite the recent devaluation of the country's currency
peso.
</P>
<P>
The observation was made in a paper by Richard Supangan, an
economist at the University of Asia and the Pacific Institute of
Economic Policy Research.
</P>
<P>
In the paper, which was published here today, Supangan cited a
recent business expectations and perceptions survey conducted by
the UA&AMP;P School of Economics. The majority of the respondents came
from the Philippine industry and services sectors, he said.
</P>
<P>
Supangan said that despite the recent devaluation of the peso,
the businessmen's mood is "definitely upbeat, the tiger cub
continues to grow."
</P>
<P>
Even before the peso depreciation, he said, local firms were
expecting a slight increase in the country's exports value.
</P>
<P>
After the peso depreciation, they are now in a better position
to increase their export earnings, Supangan said.
</P>
<P>
In the first five months of this year, the country's export
rose by nearly 23 percent to 9.6 billion U.S. dollars, from 7.8
billion dollars last year. The manufactured items accounted for 90
percent of the total exports.
</P>
<P>
Supangan said that among the listed concerns in the survey,
which was conducted two weeks ago, the foreign exchange rate came
out on top.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in two years, he said, the respondents were
most apprehensive about the peso's exchange rate with the dollar,
which is around 28.5:1 now.
</P>
<P>
He said that the businessmen wanted a gradual depreciation of
the peso, but the currency's sudden fall last month to around 29
pesos to the dollar has made the point moot.
</P>
<P>
But more than 80 percent of the respondents expect the second
half to definitely be better than the first, the economist said.
</P>
<P>
In the first four months of the year, the country's economic
activity has inched up with the value of production index moving
up by 10.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> China to Launch First Advertising Firm in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 10 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to launch its
first advertising company in the United States this month, said
today's Business Weekly of China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yanming, chairman of Hairun International Advertising Co.,
Ltd., is in Los Angeles where he is supervising the establishment
of a branch.
</P>
<P>
Hairun, a major Chinese advertising company, hopes the branch
will help introduce more Chinese products to the US market, while
bringing more US appliances and goods to China, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
US prices of Chinese-made products generally are low because of
a lack of promotion, he said. Also, high promotion costs in the
United States prohibit most Chinese companies from advertising
there.
</P>
<P>
Hairun's first promotion will be for shampoo made by Chongqing
Olive Cosmetics Co., Ltd., one of the largest manufacturers of
daily-use chemicals. The company expects a one billion yuan (120
million US dollars) sales volume this year.
</P>
<P>
Hairun's Los Angles office will also invest in movie production
and TV shows.

<HEADLINE> China to Tighten Supervision over Capital Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 10 (Xinhua) -- China will strengthen control of
the state-funded capital assets by creating a special group to
manage capital assets, said today's Business Weekly of China Daily.
</P>
<P>
This is an experimental project to be implemented in several
cities, and only local enterprises would be subject to the
experiment.
</P>
<P>
Hu Yiping, an official with State Commission of Economic
Restructuring officials said that the move was expected to clarify
the relationship between the government and state-owned
companies.
</P>
<P>
The government set up a council similar to a shareholders'
board in a publicly traded firm to make major decisions about
state capital and assets.
</P>
<P>
The council comprising government chiefs, leaders of economic
sectors, Party chiefs, state property supervision departments and
experts, bears the duty to outline the investment direction and
strategy for the state's capital assets, assess the performance of
its executive body and appoint or remove executive chiefs. But it
is not involved in managing the enterprises it decides to invest
in.
</P>
<P>
Under the council is a government-funded operational body that
is similar to the board of directors of a shareholding company.
</P>
<P>
The reform is significant because for the first time it
specifies who performs the duties and shares investment returns
for the state, the largest investor of state-owned firms, Hu
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Michelle Smith, triple Olympic
gold medalist in Atlanta, set a European short-course record in
the 200-meter butterfly in Cork, Ireland on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Irish woman clocked 2 minutes 7.04 seconds to beat the
previous mark of 2:07.18.
</P>
<P>
However, the world mark of 2:05.65 set by American Mary Meagher
in 1981, remains intact.
</P>
<P>
Smith swam for the record all alone in the 25-meter pool as a
tuneup for the European Swimming Championship slated for Wednesday
in Seville, Spain.
</P>
<P>
Being defending champion in the 200 butterfly and the 200
individual medley, Smith has entered six events in Seville but she
said the longer 400- and 800-meter freestyles would get the axe.
</P>
<P>
Smith shocked the world by taking three gold medals at the 1996
Atlanta Olympics from the 400 freestyle, 200 individual medley and
400 individual medley. She also finished third in the 200
butterfly.

<HEADLINE> China's Mineral Industry Faces Higher Market Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 10 (Xinhua) -- China plans to promote
investment at home and abroad as demand for mineral soars, said
today's Business Weekly of China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Demand is expected to more than double by the year 2020, Song
Ruixiang, minister of geology and mineral resources, is quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Natural resource reserves account for only nine percent of China's
national wealth. "Although it is growing quickly, China's GDP
will face a severe mineral shortage in the future," Song said.
</P>
<P>
In China, minerals supply 95 percent of primary energy and 75
percent of industrial raw materials. Song warned of a possible
bottleneck in mineral supply in 30 or 50 years if investment does
not increase substantially.
</P>
<P>
China has a mineral trade surplus about a decade ago, but it
became a net oil importer in 1994. Now the country has an overall
mineral trade deficit as the import of copper, iron ore and
fertilizer climbs.
</P>
<P>
"If we continue to solve the shortage through pure purchases in
world markets, we could face possible price hikes and
consequently, an unstable mineral supply." the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said that imports should give way to direct investment
abroad to tap foreign mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
Chinese oil and mineral companies have begun to invest in Latin
American Africa and Asia by buying stock.
</P>
<P>
He said that China had to tap as many as foreign cheap
resources as possible in the first 50 years of the next century,
which is likely to be the last time mineral prices will be
relatively low.
</P>
<P>
Despite the need to spill overseas, he noted that China has to
rely on its own mineral resources to sustain economic growth. Lack
of financial input has led to slower growth in identifiable
mineral reserves in recent years.
</P>
<P>
If well financed, China could find more deposits, especially in
the west, Song said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Chongqing, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The All-China Women's
Federation recently donated 1.56 million yuan (188,000 US dollars)
to help more than 1,000 rural girls in the outlying outskirtan
area of Chongqing, China's newest municipality, return to school.
</P>
<P>
The donation, funded by the China Children's Foundation and
women's organizations in Hong Kong, will be used to establish 19
classes for girls in remote and poverty-stricken areas in the
Three Gorges Dam region.
</P>
<P>
The girls were denied the opportunity to attend school because
of poverty and the fact that parents prefer to educate male
children.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing has helped more than 800 girls in need return to
primary or middle schools, and plans to raise seven million yuan
(843,000 US dollars) over the next two years to enable another
12,000 girls to return to the classroom.

<HEADLINE> New Trade Scheme to Boost Sino-African Economic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Government has made
a 21st-century African strategy that focuses on the continent's
markets, so as to further boost the Sino-African trade, according
to China Daily Business Weekly today.
</P>
<P>
At a two-day symposium attracted 19 Chinese ambassadors,
consul-generals and commercial councillors and more than 300
Chinese business people last week in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Yang Wensheng, assistant minister of foreign trade and economic
cooperation, said Africa, with a population of 700 million, has an
annual trade volume of more than 200 billion US dollars. But China
makes up less than two percent of this market.
</P>
<P>
To augment Sino-African trade and economic cooperation, China
plans to establish a coordination group led by Vice-Premier Li
Lanqing.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the group planned to expand economic
links with African countries, hand-picking key trading partners
and commodities, natural resources development, engineering and
labour contracting projects.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is helping domestic enterprises set up
10 trade and investment centers in Africa, and Chinese enterprises
are interested in the under-tapped market, trade officials noted.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the efforts by Chinese government and business people
in exploiting the African market, China's overall trade volume
with the continent has increased. Chinese customs statistics
showed the bilateral trade in the first half of the soared 45
percent to 2.55 billion dollars, and trade officials estimate the
figure is expected to hit five billion dollars this year, compared
to 4.2 billion dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Good political ties between China and most African countries
and the rapidly developing economies in some African countries
have laid a base fro expanding bilateral economic ties, trade
officials said.

<HEADLINE> "El Nino" Causes Over Thousand Fires in Colombia Since July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The climate phenomenon
"El Nino" has caused 1,152 fires since July in Colombia,
destroying more than 7,000 hectares of mountain forests.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-seven percent of the affected areas belong to protected
areas, natural parks, and zones of barren plateaus, the
Environment Ministry said here today.
</P>
<P>
El Nino is a warm inshore current annually flowing south along
the coast of Ecuador and, about every seven to ten years,
extending down the coast of Peru, where it has a devastating
effect on weather, crops and fish.
</P>
<P>
High temperatures and drought produced by "El Nino" affected
especially the Atlantic coast region and the Andean zone, where
the Orange Alert has been declared.
</P>
<P>
The Environment Ministry has joined forces with the National
Direction for the Prevention and Attention to Disasters and the
Colombian Air Force in combating the fires.

<HEADLINE> Mieckiwicz Wins Stage Victory in Tour of Denmark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Jacek Mieckiwicz of Poland won
the fourth stage of Tour of Denmark on Saturday after defending
champion Fabrizio Guidi of Italy suffered a miserable fall with
only a few meters from the finish line.
</P>
<P>
Guidi was hospitalized with a broken left collar bone after he
failed to avoid a collision with Australia's Robbie McEwen in the
last spurt of the stage.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the confusion, Miekiwicz surged ahead to win the
235-kilometer stage from Kolding to Odense in five hours 34
minutes 44 seconds.
</P>
<P>
McEwen, who surrendered the yellow jersey to Giovanni Lombardi
of Italy after the third stage, was disqualified and relegated to
bottom position in the day's stage.
</P>
<P>
Servais Knaven of the Netherlands retained the yellow jersey
after finishing in 21st in the same time as Mieckiwicz, with an
11-second lead over Denmark's Peter Meinert.
</P>
<P>
The 859-km race will conclude in Copenhagen on Sunday.
