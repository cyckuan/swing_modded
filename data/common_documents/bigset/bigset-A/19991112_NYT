 By W.H. STICKNEY JR.  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
LAS VEGAS _ Custodians at the Boxing Hall of Fame probably already
have dusted and cleaned out one little corner of the building, a
sanctuary reserved for future resident Evander Holyfield.
<TEXT>
<P>
   He is the only boxer besides Muhammad Ali to claim the world
heavyweight championship three times and is certain to be enshrined
five years after the day he finally decides to hang up his gloves.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield's ultimate place in history is not a subject the
part-time Houston resident dwells on.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it takes some serious urging to get him to give more
than casual heed to the theme.
</P>
<P>
   Upon persistent prodding, Holyfield, who turned 37 in October,
said Thursday, ``If you go by statistic-wise, I'm already one of
the best, if not the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you can't make anybody believe you.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield's track record should speak for itself.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly the undisputed world cruiserweight champion, Holyfield
in 1988 moved up to heavyweight and gradually began carving out a
niche for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always said I was going to be heavyweight champion of the
world someday,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though a shot at a world title evaded him through the first
couple of years he campaigned as a heavyweight, Holyfield finally
got his big shot in the fall of 1990.
</P>
<P>
   James ``Buster'' Douglas had upset the boxing world earlier that
year, knocking out Mike Tyson in Tokyo to take away the undisputed
heavyweight championship.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas sat idle over the next seven months, then looked like a
beached whale when he lumbered in against Holyfield, who turned
Douglas' lights out with a third-round knockout.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield successfully defended the crown against former
champion George Foreman, Bert Cooper and ex-champ Larry Holmes,
then suffered the first loss of his pro career in the first of
three fights with Riddick Bowe.
</P>
<P>
   A dispute with the World Boxing Council resulted in Bowe dumping
that organization's title and belt into a trash can. But he
retained the World Boxing Association and International Boxing
Federation titles.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield took the WBA and IBF titles back in a rematch _ the
infamous ``Fan Man'' bout at Caesars Palace here.
</P>
<P>
   But in the first defense of his newly reclaimed crowns,
Holyfield looked increasingly aged as each round progressed and
lost a unanimous decision to Michael Moorer.
</P>
<P>
   An incorrect diagnosis of a heart ailment ensued, forcing
Holyfield to briefly retire.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield returned to health in 1994, and in 1995 he beat Ray
Mercer to herald his comeback.
</P>
<P>
   One year later, Holyfield gained a piece of boxing immortality.
The history-making fight was a match with Mike Tyson, a 25-1
favorite who at the time was the WBA champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew going into that fight that Tyson wasn't the baddest
fellow around, like he wanted everybody to believe,'' said
Holyfield trainer Don Turner. ``We knew he could be beaten.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield rocked Tyson over the first two rounds, then knocked
him out in the 11th.
</P>
<P>
   He was champion again. For the third time. Proof positive, says
Turner, ``that Evander is the best there is or ever was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put him at the top. You can't put him anywhere but at the
top. Look what he's done. He's beat everybody that's supposed to be
anybody, all the good fighters of his day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ain't no man, other than Ali, been heavyweight champion of the
world three times. 'Nuff said.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight months ago, a lot more was being said. On the 21st
anniversary of Ali's epic battle with Joe Frazier at Madison Square
Garden, Holyfield visited the sports mecca to face Lennox Lewis in
a heavyweight title unification bout.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis owned the WBC title; Holyfield, the WBA and IBF belts.
</P>
<P>
   Though it appeared to everyone but two of the three ringside
judges that Lewis had clearly won the bout and become England's
first undisputed world heavyweight champ in 100 years, the verdict
rendered was a draw.
</P>
<P>
   Critics were questioning how anyone could have deemed
Holyfield's performance worthy of a draw. And he has consistently
been asked if the sport hasn't passed him by.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody can say what they want to say. You can't stop people
from thinking and saying what they want,'' Holyfield responds.
``The fact of the matter is what you do in the ring. I'm 37 years
old, and the point is, `Can Evander still perform?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Won't nobody have to guess, because they will get an
opportunity to see it in the fight (Saturday night at the Thomas &AMP;
Mack Center on the campus of UNLV).
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't that I was too old in (the initial fight). It was
just that I was a little under the weather. But being under the
weather, you still have to go to work or go home with no check.
These are decisions one has to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield vows his performance, the manner in which Lewis
responds and the outcome Saturday will be completely different from
last March.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will redeem myself, and people will see a better Evander
than they have seen in my whole boxing career,'' he said. ``This
definitely may be one of my greatest fights.''

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Nov. 12:
</P>
<P>
   One of the roles of higher education is to provide a place where
ideas and beliefs can collide, where students can learn to tolerate
even points of view they find obnoxious. For decades, radical
movements and countermovements in America have used the campus as a
place to form and grow, to articulate ideas and promote goals. That
has been true of the black civil rights movement in the 1950s and
60s, the Vietnam War opposition and the feminist movement of the
1960s and 70s, the gay rights movement of the 1970s and the
conservative Christian movement of the 1980s and 90s.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those groups had to fight, on campus and in court,
either for the right to organize in groups on campus or, in the
case of blacks, to enter the campus at all. When a college
administration recognized a new group, it gave it legitimacy, space
to meet in, the ability to advertise itself on college bulletin
boards and newspapers, and access to potential new members in the
student body. But the marketplace of ideas costs money to support,
and for generations students at American colleges and universities
have been required to pay activities fees that now support a long
roster of organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The democratic appeal of the activities fees was that everyone
was required to invest in an environment that promoted everyone
else's right of free speech and assembly. But now the Supreme Court
will rule on a case that threatens to undermine the support system
at public institutions. At the University of Wisconsin, where
mandatory fee money goes to support any nonpartisan student group
that applies for a share, three conservative Christian law students
have argued that they should not have to pay to support 18
organizations that espouse gay rights, women's rights and other
causes with which they disagree. A federal court of appeals has
upheld their objections.
</P>
<P>
   But the fee money also supports more than 100 other groups,
including conservative Christian organizations like the Pro-Life
Action League and Campus Crusade for Christ, as well as the
Catholic Student Union, Buddhists, Muslims and a law group called
The Federalist Society, to which the lead plaintiff in this case
belonged. There have always been _ and always will be _ parents and
students who think they have a right to be protected from ideas
they do not like. But it should not be up to students or parents to
choose which courses or campus organizations deserve support and
which do not. That should be the university's mandate, and the
Supreme Court should say so.

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Nov. 12:
</P>
<P>
   Americorps, President Clinton's national service program, has
survived the budget warfare in Washington. An appropriations
measure already signed by Clinton earmarks $438.5 million for the
valuable five-year-old program _ roughly the same amount as last
year.
</P>
<P>
   This will allow Americorps to continue supplying nonprofit
groups around the country with volunteers, who receive a $4,725
educational stipend in exchange for an intensive year performing
worthwhile tasks like tutoring at-risk children, restoring
dilapidated housing and parks, and helping communities rebuild
after natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointingly, however, Congress ignored a White House request
for additional funding that would have allowed Americorps to
significantly expand its present complement of about 40,000
members. As in previous years, Republicans bent on embarrassing the
President made sure the House version of the budget contained no
money for the program, forcing its Senate supporters to scramble
for the funds necessary to keep it going at its current level.
</P>
<P>
   Congress undervalues the accomplishments of Americorps' mostly
young volunteers and the hard-working agencies that sponsor them.
Next year's debate should focus on spreading the program's spirit
of service instead of trying to kill it.

NASCAR A VERY BIG DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To put NASCAR's new TV deal into an easy to understand context,
it is tantamount to the NFL, at the urging of commissioner Pete
Rozelle, agreeing in 1962 to sell its national TV rights as a
single unit.
</P>
<P>
   It's worked wonders for the NFL, which is still giggling over
the $17.6 billion in TV contracts it signed the last time it went
to market. NASCAR's decision has the same sense of ingenuity.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the TV rights to NASCAR Winston Cup races were sold
individually by the tracks, which caused some inequities from race
to race and splintered marketing. Every network had some small
piece of the stock car season.
</P>
<P>
   But beginning late last year, NASCAR started terminating some TV
deals early so it could take its entire package to market. The
result was Thursday's announcement of two package deals, one with
NBC and Turner Sports and the other with Fox Sports, that have a
combined worth for NASCAR of $400 million-plus a year.
</P>
<P>
   Fox signed an eight-year deal calling for NASCAR events in the
first half of the year, beginning in 2001. NBC signed a six-year
deal and Turner an eight-year pact for the second half of the
package, beginning in July. More than 70 percent of all Winston Cup
events will be aired on an over-the-air network, and each
half-season package will likely include 17 events.
</P>
<P>
   It is standard at times like this for the dealmakers to say the
money wasn't the key issue, and NASCAR execs did. But the packaging
concept for the sport is truly as important as cash.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR's first-half will receive a huge boost from promotion
during Fox's NFL playoff coverage each January, and its second-half
will get the same kind of boost from NBC's NBA playoff coverage.
And the series will be anchored to three well-known networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are reorganizing the packages and creating a national
franchise at the same time,'' said Brian France, NASCAR's senior
vice-president. ``That was our goal. I think we now have a
promotional platform as good as any in sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Without question, the top execs and Fox and NBC were ecstatic
about writing checks. In a decade that has seen sports ratings
steadily decline, even for the monolithic NFL, NASCAR's numbers are
going up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sitting here with a fact sheet about NASCAR that awes
you,'' said Fox Sports President David Hill. ``It's number two
among all sports, trailing the NFL but ahead of the NBA, NHL and
baseball. It's number two in male demographics, beating the NBA by
27 percent. Their household numbers are up 70 percent while others
are eroding. And NASCAR isn't just a rural phenomenon. The numbers
are great in cities like Philadelphia and Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only sport of the '90s that has had sustained growth,
and that's been with six different (TV) partners,'' said NBC Sports
President Dick Ebersol, who will use NASCAR as programming to
counter NFL Sundays in the fall. ``It's often been difficult for
fans to know where NASCAR races are. This will make it easier for
the fan, and they'll get a chance to know these people (drivers and
teams) a whole lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   With winners, there are also losers. CBS loses four NASCAR
events after the 2000 season, including the Daytona 500, the
biggest (and first) race of every season. Beginning in 2001, Fox
and NBC will alternate Daytona each year.
</P>
<P>
   ABC/ESPN loses 18 events, five of them on ABC, including the
Brickyard 400. A ESPN spokesman said the two nets would lose about
195 hours of programming, but still has hundreds of hours of other
motor sports in hand. It will keep its RPM2Night daily show on
ESPN2 despite losing the NASCAR package.
</P>
<P>
   Big numbers
</P>
<P>
   The NFL's TV ratings keep humming along. The season to date
averages have Fox at 10.8, up seven percent over last year; CBS at
8.8, up nine percent; ABC's Monday Nighter at 13.9, up two percent;
and ESPN at 6.4, up 16 percent. One ratings point is equal to
994,000 homes.
</P>
<P>
   This comes at a time when most experts say the quality of play
has deteriorated because of retirements, injuries and a shallow
pool of quarterbacks. The only reasonable answer is that fans enjoy
seeing fresh faces on TV, like the St. Louis Rams, Tennessee Titans
and Indianapolis Colts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone had told me that the Giants and Redskins would lead
the (NFC) East, the Lions the Central and the Rams the West, I
would have gone to bank with him,'' said Fox analyst John Madden.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one saw this coming. Here we are at midseason, and no one
knows what's going to happen, not even the experts. When you don't
know what's going to happen, you've got to watch it. It's
topsy-turvy and interesting as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. Of the 128 games played to date, 65 were decided by a
touchdown or less, and 43 of those 65 were decided by three points
or less. Fifty different quarterbacks have started at least one
game among 31 teams. That has a lot to do with so many surprise
endings.
</P>
<P>
   Madden fears the quarterback shortage for the league's long-term
health. ``There are not enough Peyton Mannings to go around,'' he
said. ``I read where the top four quarterbacks in the league have
all played in NFL Europe. Well, that's great for NFL Europe, but it
doesn't speak well of the quality of quarterbacking in the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   And now the news
</P>
<P>
   Longtime L.A. voice Rich Marotta is picking up more work for Fox
Sports Net. He'll do live reports from the Holyfield-Lewis fight
this weekend, including post-fight interviews and commentatary.
``These two guys have a big responsibility for the entire sport.
They need to come out and fight and really make something happen.''
Marotta is picking Lewis. The fight is available on pay-per-view
via TVKO. ... ESPN airs its ``SportsCenter of the Decade, 1990s,''
today at 4 p.m. ... Irv Kaze's KIEV (870 am) show Saturday (6 p.m.)
features ex-Trojan (Vince Evans, Paul McDonald) and ex-Bruin
quarterbacks (Tom Ramsey, Matt Stevens) ... Tuesday's edition of
``Real Sports'' on HBO includes a segment on the 1966 Notre
Dame-Michigan game.

ALBRIGHT OFFERS TO ABSORB CRITICISM FOR DEAL ON U.N. DUES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ADDS Rubin's declining to give details in 9th graf; DELETES
``blocking in 10th graf; Adds background in 13th graf; CORRECTS
Holbrooke's title in 14th graf; Story now moves in 2 takes) 
(sw) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has
volunteered to be the lightning rod for criticism from abortion
rights groups if President Clinton compromises with Congress on a
deal to free nearly $1 billion the United States owes the United
Nations, senior administration officials said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As a Cabinet member who supports abortion rights, Albright has
urged the White House to cut a deal that some administration
officials fear could strike some Clinton supporters as a retreat
from the president's pledge to defend abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, the administration has refused a demand from House
conservatives, led by Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., to cut off
U.S. financing to international organizations that promote abortion
rights as a condition to repaying Washington's debt to the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   White House domestic advisers, in particular, have been loath to
alienate a core Democratic constituency, women voters, by backing
away from Clinton's commitment on abortion rights abroad to resolve
an increasingly embarrassing foreign policy issue.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent months, Albright, a former ambassador to the
United Nations, has aggressively lobbied Republican lawmakers and
Clinton to resolve several issues that threaten American global
leadership: the United Nations dues, debt relief to impoverished
countries and foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   Albright recently told John Podesta, the White House chief of
staff, that if services offered by abortion rights groups overseas
are only minimally affected by any deal, the administration should
be willing to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have to move off existing law, as a woman secretary of
state who knows extremely well the instinctive concerns of women's
groups, she's prepared to take the heat,'' said a senior
administration official, who would speak on the condition of
anonymity. ``She is prepared to meet with them and explain to them
why this does not harm our fundamental position, but that getting
the U.N. dues is critical for our national security.''
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, declined to comment on
any offer Albright had made, saying, ``We're committed to paying
our fair share at the United Nations by paying our back dues, and
we're working very hard on a way to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   A State Department spokesman, James Rubin, also declined to
comment on any offer or details of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers and administration officials said discussions
continued Thursday on the abortion issue, which is holding up a
deal on the U.N. payments, one of the last major sticking points in
a session-ending budget deal.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators also faced a new environmental amendment delaying a
ban on road building in national forests and a dispute over debt
relief to impoverished countries. But the abortion issue could be
the last issue left on the bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still a great deal of rigor on that, as regarding the
question of whether or not American tax dollars should be used by
the U.N. or any other agencies to lobby other nations on their
abortion laws,'' said Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority
leader.
</P>
<P>
   While the United States has had disputes over its debts to the
United Nations for years, the issue escalated after the Republicans
took control of Congress in 1994. Dislike of the United Nations by
many lawmakers, and the linkage of dues to the abortion issue, has
effectively thwarted any effort to pay the dues in full.
</P>
<P>
   The aggressive lobbying by Albright and Richard Holbrooke, the
new chief U.S. delegate to the United Nations, to repay $926
million over the next three years has been well known.
</P>
<P>
   Making known Albright's intention to absorb the political flak
of a sensitive domestic political decision serves several purposes.
</P>
<P>
   It prepares abortion rights groups for a possible deal they may
not like, and that will probably affect the presidential campaign
of Vice President Al Gore and the possible Senate campaign of first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   It also serves to pressure wavering White House domestic
advisers. And it could be intended to steal some of the limelight
from Holbrooke, with whom Albright has had a tense relationship.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Family planning groups reacted cautiously to reports of
Albright's willingness to bear the brunt of any political fallout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that will cut family planning is hardly a compromise
on the issue of abortion,'' said Susan Cohen, assistant director of
policy development for the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a research
and advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Despite declarations that a deal may be near, only a tiny number
of people are intimately involved with the talks, mainly between
Steve Ricchetti, a White House deputy chief of staff, and Scott B.
Palmer, chief of staff for the speaker of the House, Dennis
Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   The ingredients of a possible deal include using Smith's
language but allowing presidential waivers to that provision for
international organizations that provide abortions or lobby for
abortion rights. The agreement would also include funding penalties
imposed by Congress on the amount of U.S. grants awarded to the
foreign organizations if the waivers were used.
</P>
<P>
   Administration and congressional aides said there were other
approaches under consideration that they refused to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   But all sides agree that the political climate and cast of
characters this year enhance the prospects of ending a three-year
battle.
</P>
<P>
   This year, for instance, Clinton is free from the distractions
of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, and advisers like Albright and
Holbrooke have been pushing harder to resolve the issue. That is in
part because the stakes are higher. The United States will lose its
vote in the U.N. General Assembly if it fails to meet a Dec. 31
deadline for payments
</P>
<P>
   The dispute does not threaten the U.S. vote or seat on the U.N.
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   There are also practical budget considerations for striking a
deal this year. Under the 1997 balanced budget agreement, Congress
can appropriate money for the United Nations without having to make
cuts in other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, that will not be allowed, making repayment in an
election year much more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are also feeling some pressure. Some conservatives
do not want to give Clinton ammunition to fuel his charges that
Republicans are isolationist.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who opposes abortion, has quietly
urged both sides to reconcile, and he called Hastert on Wednesday
to offer his advice. Helms wants a deal because a Senate bill that
he sponsored ties the repayment of $926 million over three years to
changes he wants at the United Nations, including reducing budgets
and the United States' share of payments.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders are also weighing in with Republicans. The
Business Roundtable and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are pushing
for a deal to pay back the dues and carry out reforms at the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The Better World Campaign, a group financed by Ted Turner that
advocates repaying the debt, has hired Haley Barbour, former
chairman of the Republican National Committee, to lobby on its
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   It still remains unclear whether House conservatives will
support a deal. Their demand is to write into law an executive
order issued by President Ronald Reagan in 1984. Clinton reversed
the order in 1993, shortly after taking office.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has barred direct financing for abortion since
1973, but the 1984 policy, known familiarly as ``Mexico City''
since Reagan announced it during a U.N. conference there, denied
grants to international family-planning organizations for any
purpose if they promoted abortion rights.

BIG FIGHT, YEAH RIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS---Oh no, here we go again, another Big Fight involving
(a) Don King, (b) Evander Holyfield, (c) Lennox Lewis, (d) Las
Vegas and (e) the gullible, exploited, gouged, worn-out fistic
patrons who (f) will pay up to $2,000 for ringside tickets and (g)
$49.95 to watch the pay per view telecast.
</P>
<P>
   What will happen Saturday night in the long unanticipated
rematch between Holyfield and Lewis at the Thomas &AMP; Mack Center?
</P>
<P>
   Will Lennox Lewis navigate backward for 12 rounds, as Oscar De
La Hoya did recently in his ripoff snoozer against Felix Trinidad?
Will Evander Holyfield throw a late punch that results in a
no-contest decision, as Mike Tyson did recently in his latest sorry
spectacle against Orlin Norris? Will Lewis dominate the proceedings
and wind up with a distasteful draw, which is what happened in his
first engagement with Holyfield?
</P>
<P>
   The strong feeling here is that Lewis and Holyfield will
dispense a replica of their March 11 bit of non-violence at Madison
Square Garden, but that this time Lewis will be awarded with a
decision that will temporarily knock the sport's reigning Rasputin,
Don King, out of the heavyweight title picture.
</P>
<P>
   You never, of course, know for sure what will unfold in a boxing
ring in one of these high-profile events, especially in this weird
fight year in which, against all odds, the IBF's president, Bob
Lee, winds up being indicted of accepting bribes to fix boxing
ratings before the WBC's lovable Jose Sulaiman, long-time
unofficial partner of King in all sorts of shenanigans.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there are passionate Holyfield advocates who think their
37-year-old hero simply had an off evening against Lewis and that
he will rise gallantly this time to score a spectacular upset
victory as he did so memorably in the past against Tyson and
Riddick Bowe.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe he will.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe Don King will give a glowing testimonial at Bob Arum's
70th birthday party.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe Lennox Lewis, whose dull, safety-first style doesn't
exactly inspire the passions of the aficionados, will react to
Holyfield's baiting tactics and actually brawl with him.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, and Shaquille O'Neal suddenly will start shooting free
throws as though he were Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evander Holyfield is a totally shot fighter,'' his former
manager, Lou Duva told me several months back. ``He shouldn't be
fighting, and Lewis will handle him easily again and probably knock
him out.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure that will happen because that would constitute
Lennox Lewis having to become aggressive and taking risks, which
he's never done in his career and which he did not do in that first
fight against Holyfield that he controlled from long range with his
superior left jab and strength.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-5 Lewis easily tied up Holyfield on those few occasions
when the 6-1 Atlanta native managed to maneuver inside. And Lewis'
84-inch reach---Holyfield's is listed at 77{---turned out to be a
decisive advantage against an aging opponent who seemed to have
lost his quickness and desire.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing figures to change.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis still possesses his size and power, while the 37-year-old
Holyfield is another 7{ months older.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't myself in that first fight against Lewis because I
had a stomach ailment,'' says Holyfield, not so convincingly. ``I
just fought poorly, and had a bad performance. It will be different
this time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to let the judges decide this fight,'' promises
Lewis. ``I'm going to knock out Holyfield.''
</P>
<P>
   And Lewis probably could if he would shed his conservative
tactics and open up against Holyfield, but that's simply not his
style.
</P>
<P>
   It won't surprise me if Holyfield-Lewis II is as yawningly
tiresome as Holyfield-Lewis I.
</P>
<P>
   Natch, Don King envisions only drama, tension and violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be the greatest fight of all time,'' he cackles.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps the worst.
</P>
<P>
   The only surefire winners in this match are the participants,
each of whom is guaranteed of earning $15 million, and King, who
will earn his usual undisclosed millions.
</P>
<P>
   The losers?
</P>
<P>
   If you go by what has happened in recent times, it will be those
cursed souls who wind up investing money on an event that would
turn out to be a stunner only if it comes close to living up to Don
King's inflated expectations. . .
</P>
<P>
   bullet If Evander Holyfield seems to have lost the ferocious
fire in his heart, it's quite understandable. They tell me the guy
is worth about $60 million, and he lives in a 45,000-square foot
mansion in Atlanta. How can he work himself into a maniacal state
at his age for such a savage activity?. . .
</P>
<P>
   bullet Robert Daly's first major move with the Dodgers was a
winner with the signing of Shawn Green, and another positive move
would be to bring back Steve Brener to boost the team's sagging
public image.
</P>
<P>
   There is recurring speculation that this might happen---Brener
was the best PR man the Dodgers ever had---but it's no certainty
that Brener would return.
</P>
<P>
   He owns a lucrative public relations firm in the San Fernando
Valley---the NFL, Showtime, the LPGA are just a few of his
clients---and it would take a sizable financial package to uproot
him now from his secure and cushy position to spin tales for Kevin
Malone and Gary Sheffield.
</P>
<P>
   Brener this week has been at the Desert Inn hyping the LPGA's
PageNet Championship. . .
</P>
<P>
   bullet After Charles Barkley's impressive takedown of Shaquille
O'Neal the other evening, it's obvious Sir Charles has quite a
future in the WWF. . .
</P>
<P>
   bullet I just wish Shaquille O'Neal would become as enraged with
his pathetic deportment from the free throw line as he does with
guys dealing him hard fouls, or bouncing basketballs off his
anatomy. . .
</P>
<P>
   bullet The question to me about USC's Paul Hackett is not if he
can coach, but, instead, how in tarnation did ever wind up becoming
a coach at USC in the first place after his disastrous stay at
Pittsburgh?. . .
</P>
<P>
   bullet Long Beach celebrity bodyguard Mike (The Hammer) DiMarzo
recruited his brother, Tony (The Baddest Bull) DiMarzo, a federal
prison guard in Florence, Col., to work with him here tonight at
the Sammy Hagar concert at the Hard Rock Hotel. . .
</P>
<P>
   bullet One of the most well-liked athletic PR operatives in
Southern California history, Bob Steiner, has retired from Jerry
Buss' organization. Steiner has been Buss' top man for the past 20
years and also is well-known in track and field as being one of the
sport's best public address announcers. . .
</P>
<P>
   bullet I never realized the great former Bakersfield College and
Los Angeles State football coach, Homer Beatty, is living in Long
Beach. . .
</P>
<P>
   bullet The Montreal writers tell me the new Angels general
manager, Bill Stoneman, is a bottom-line guy in financial matters,
which means the Angels don't figure to be active in the free agent
market in upcoming seasons. . .
</P>
<P>
   bullet Toronto Blue Jays running coach Maury Wills tells me he
has worked closely with Shawn Green, and says the new Dodger
outfielder is a terrific person who will be become a ``huge
presence in Los Angeles for at least the next 10 years.''. . .
</P>
<P>
   bullet Honestly, it won't be startling to me if Saturday's women
volleyball showdown at the Pyramid between Long Beach State and UOP
winds up being more entertaining than the Holyfield-Lewis fight
that, deservedly, seems to have inspired wide-spread public
indifference.

A QUICK FIX FOR BOXING?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Boxing could sure use a good fight Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It's been that kind of year, one that started with so much
promise but unraveled into a mess that has left everyone disgusted
with the sport.
</P>
<P>
   There were pathetic fights, maddening decisions, indictments for
selling rankings and another bizarre episode involving Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   This is why those in the boxing business are hoping _ (begin
ital)praying(end ital) _ the rematch between Lennox Lewis and
Evander Holyfield is a good one.
</P>
<P>
   ``This fight is being billed as the fight of the millennium. We
just need it to be the fight of the year,'' said Mark Taffet, head
of TVKO, HBO's pay-per-view arm.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, things looked good this year after a 1998 void of
meaningful matchups.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar De La Hoya had outpointed Ike Quartey in a thrilling fight
in February and plans were made for the meeting we'd all been
waiting for: De La Hoya-Trinidad, in September.
</P>
<P>
   Also, it was announced that Holyfield and Lewis _ seen as the
two best heavyweights in the world _ would meet in March.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, boxing fans had reason to be excited. And then they
didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the short list of things that went wrong:
</P>
<P>
   _Lewis seemed to have beaten Holyfield soundly, but the fight
was scored a draw, leaving fans with dropped jaws and little faith
in boxing's judging system.
</P>
<P>
   _De La Hoya outboxed Trinidad for eight-plus rounds but ran the
final three-plus rounds and lost, though most believed he had done
enough to win. The fight was both a dud (begin ital)and(end ital)
controversial.
</P>
<P>
   _Last month, popular Naseem Hamed and Cesar Soto engaged in a
televised bout that was a hybrid of wrestling and boxing. It was
joke _ a bad joke.
</P>
<P>
   _A day later, Mike Tyson punched Orlin Norris after the first
bell, Norris fell and sprained his knee and the fight was ruled no
contest.
</P>
<P>
   _And, out of the ring, IBF president Robert Lee and others were
indicted on charges of taking payments to improve fighters'
rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Could it get any worse?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true,'' said promoter Dan Goossen of American Presents.
``It looked so promising and then it was one disappointment after
another.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest was the first Holyfield-Lewis fight. It was the
first time in a generation that the two best heavyweights in the
world met to decide who was No.1 _ Holyfield, the indestructible
warrior, or Lewis, the behemoth with remarkable strength and
athletic ability.
</P>
<P>
   And then (begin ital)splat(end ital).
</P>
<P>
   The fight wasn't horrible, but it certainly wasn't special.
Lewis was overly cautious but still controlled the action while
Holyfield seemed to be either old or off.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the decision, which seems to have served as a last
straw for many disenchanted boxing fans and the powers that be in
the sport, who are now clamoring for reform.
</P>
<P>
   How disenchanted are the fans?
</P>
<P>
   The first fight had a pay-per-view audience of 1.2 million,
eighth on the all-time list. On Saturday, most agree, TVKO will be
lucky to draw 600,000.
</P>
<P>
   And the Thomas &AMP; Mack Center might not sell out. Tickets were
still available on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't normal for a fight of this magnitude.
</P>
<P>
   At Thursday's public weigh-in, hundreds of fans from England
were present to show Lewis loud and enthusiastic support. Had they
not been there, it would've been awfully quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the Brits,'' one knowledgeable observer said, ``no one
would care.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, millions of eyes worldwide will be on the fight and many
more will watch the replay on HBO the following weekend. And boxing
people care deeply about what they think.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fight is definitely important for the future of
pay-per-view,'' Goossen said. ``If we have another bad fight, I
really think they might say, `That's it. We're not going to take it
any more.'
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a good fight, even if (the fans) stayed away this
time, they might say, `OK, it was a battle' and come back the next
time.''
</P>
<P>
   All the ingredients are in place for a good fight.
</P>
<P>
   The judging, so criticized after Holyfield and Lewis fought in
New York, is as solid as it gets. Nevada, not the sanctioning
bodies, selected its best and most experienced.
</P>
<P>
   Judges Jerry Roth, Chuck Giampa and Bill Graham have worked more
than 200 championship bouts between them. Mitch Halpern, perhaps
the state's most respected referee, will work the fight.
</P>
<P>
   And both fighters seem to be extremely motivated: Lewis has
yearned his entire career for the universal respect a victory would
bring him and Holyfield must prove that he's not finished at nearly
37.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you never know what might happen in boxing,
especially when Don King, Holyfield's promoter, is involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done everything we believe is possible to make this a
good fight,'' Ratner said. ``We can't judge the fight or fight the
fight, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Promoter Bob Arum, for one, thinks it's too late. The damage has
been done.
</P>
<P>
   One fight, even a fight for the undisputed heavyweight
championship such as this one, isn't going to have a tremendous
impact on the sport whether it's good or bad or otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's good, great,'' he said, but ``it's going to take a lot
of good fights to make up for what happened this past year. It's
like starting from scratch.''
</P>
<P>
   And if it's bad?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a bombed-out building, what's the difference if
you bomb it again,'' Arum said.
</P>
<P>
   Television boxing analyst Larry Merchant, who works for HBO,
also believes boxing needs a good fight. At the same time, he, like
Arum, doesn't see this as a do-or-die fight. Throughout its
history, boxing has had more than its share of disappointing
fights, corruption, controversial decisions and bizarre instances.
</P>
<P>
   And it still stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair to say that no matter what happens, they'll keep
coming back for more,'' Merchant said. ``Boxing is a resilient
sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always had black eyes. Maybe that's part of its appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not.

TALKS ON CHINA TRADE DEAL IN PERIL, U.S. SIDE SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to insert new 7th and 8th grafs, quoting U.S. official and
reporting U.S. team's plans to leave China.)  (mk) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ American officials expressed a sudden pessimism Friday
that they could reach a long-sought deal to get China into the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   In a curt statement issued to reporters Friday morning, Charlene
Barshefsky, the chief negotiator for the United States, said: ``We
came hoping to make progress. We are discouraged that progress has
not been made at this point. The clock has nearly run out.''
</P>
<P>
   The turn came the morning after Chinese officials asked
President Clinton's negotiators to remain in Beijing at least one
more day to continue discussions on how far China must open its
markets to qualify for membership in the global trade body.
</P>
<P>
   Only hours before they issued the statement, American officials
had sounded upbeat about the previous two days of talks here, which
they described as far more detailed and substantive than any
conducted with the Chinese in many months.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear whether Ms. Barshefsky issued the
severe statement as a last-minute pressure tactic or whether the
talks were collapsing.
</P>
<P>
   During the talks this week, after detailed discussions of
specific trade issues in working groups, the United States
presented China with an overall package of proposals. Earlier
Friday, American officials expressed frustration with delays in the
Chinese response, which may have led to the dramatic public
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, the Chinese haven't shown any willingness to make a
deal,'' an American official said late Friday morning, describing
the growing frustration of American negotiators here. ``It's across
the board.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barshefsky's public statement came after the Chinese
postponed a meeting scheduled for 9 a.m. Friday. The Americans now
plan to leave on Saturday, they say, after a final effort to learn
whether the Chinese will come around at the last minute, or whether
their position has seriously slipped from where it was last April,
when Prime Minister Zhu Rongji visited Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese have all along been reluctant to lower tariffs and
open industries to foreign ownership as fast as the United States
and other Western countries demanded, especially fearing the
short-term unemployment and dislocations that outside competition
could bring.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Thursday, a senior government economist, Ji
Chongwei, said: ``If the United States can lower its demands this
time, then there is likely to be an agreement. I hope the United
States can be patient and understand the reality in China, instead
of imposing excessive demands.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton is under pressure from Congress and American
companies to hold China to stringent requirements for opening its
markets, as well as to protect American textile producers from
sudden increases in imports from China.
</P>
<P>
   Up to Friday morning, both sides in the talks had been
tight-lipped. Clinton, speaking at the White House on Thursday,
said: ``When I know we have got an agreement or whether we haven't,
I'll let you know.'' Clinton was described by aides as deeply
involved in the talks, which are being held here by Ms. Barshefsky
and the director of the National Economic Council, Gene Sperling.
</P>
<P>
   After years of fumbling efforts, China and the United States,
for political as well as economic reasons, now wanted to achieve
China's entry into the WTO, which sets trade rules and adjudicates
trade disputes among countries. A breakdown now would probably cast
a sour note in bilateral relations, as China accuses the United
States of holding it to punitive standards.
</P>
<P>
   A deal was nearly struck in April, but Clinton decided that
China's concessions at the time were insufficient to pass
congressional scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Now the negotiations appear to be down to a handful of major
issues, including the rights of American companies to take majority
stakes in Chinese companies, American restrictions on the import of
Chinese textiles and questions about whether the United States
could unilaterally ban some Chinese products if it concludes that
China is violating its commitments.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, staff-level working groups met here on specific
topics, such as the right of foreign businesses to invest in _ and
take control of _ Chinese banking, telecommunications and other
companies. Rongji offered such openings in April, but the Chinese
government has been under pressure since then to back off on some
of the concessions to protect local industries and workers.
</P>
<P>
   China hopes to gain entry soon into the trade organization _
which now has 134 members _ so it can participate in a new round of
global trade talks that begin Nov. 30 in Seattle. It must first
reach bilateral accords with major trading partners and admission
by that date is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the April negotiations, the American trade office
released a description of Zhu's concessions, apparently hoping to
build support among American businesses. The release did elicit
such support, but in China it caused a firestorm, in part because
some affected ministries had not signed off on Zhu's concessions.

VOTING FOR DAYLAMI NOT A FOREIGN CONCEPT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Some Horse of the Year voters think Daylami spent
too little of 1999 in the United States, running here once and
winning the Breeders' Cup Turf last Saturday. And they're right.
</P>
<P>
   The great ones are never around long enough.
</P>
<P>
   But should that disqualify the best horse in the world from
recognition as the best horse to race in North America this year?
</P>
<P>
   It shouldn't, and if the ballot were due today I'd vote for
Irish-bred, Dubai-owned, Europe-based Daylami as Horse of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Running away with the $2 million Turf by 2{ lengths in his final
career race after a perfect ride by Frankie Dettori, the 5-year-old
gray was the most dominant of the eight winners on Breeders' Cup
day at Gulfstream Park in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The winner's purse gave him earnings this year of more than $2.4
million, third behind Dubai World Cup winner Almutawakel and
Breeders' Cup Classic winner Cat Thief, neither of whom sustained a
campaign worthy of Horse of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't count the $1 million bonus Daylami received as top
points-earner in the Emirates World Series Racing Championship
series.
</P>
<P>
   He won three major races in a row in the summer _ the Coronation
Cup at Epsom, King George VI &AMP; Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot by
five lengths under 133 pounds and Irish Champion Stakes at
Leopardstown by nine under 130 _ before finishing ninth in the Prix
de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp on the kind of ``heavy'' turf he
detests.
</P>
<P>
   Those victories in Europe would mean nothing for the purposes of
the Horse of the Year contest if Daylami hadn't been so impressive
in the Breeders' Cup. Is it proper to consider them now?
</P>
<P>
   The NTRA, which administers the Horse of the Year and Eclipse
Award voting, provides no rules to guide us. The precedents are
contradictory.
</P>
<P>
   _Voters weighed Cigar's victory in the 1996 Dubai World Cup _
one of two major victories in that season of his decline _ when
they gave him a second consecutive Horse of the Year Award.
</P>
<P>
   So the precedent exists for considering overseas performances.
And if racing follows the trend of the past decade, the sport will
become increasingly international in nature, and we'll learn to
embrace the great foreign horses.
</P>
<P>
   _Miesque won the Eclipse Award as outstanding turf female in
1987 and 1988 even though her Breeders' Cup Mile victories were her
only U.S. starts those years. Arazi won the 2-year-old championship
with his Breeders' Cup Juvenile victory in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Why should the criteria for Horse of the Year be any stricter?
</P>
<P>
   _All Along, the French filly who was voted Horse of the Year in
1983 _ the year before the first Breeders' Cup _ counted three
victories in U.S. and Canada among her seven starts.
</P>
<P>
   To listen to some voters, racing three times in this country
would be enough, twice would be arguable, but once is too few. The
distinction sounds arbitrary.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, if you set hard-and-fast standards for foreign
horses, you have to set hard-and-fast standards for American
horses, too. Pretty soon you're simply handing the trophy to the
horse with the highest earnings or the most Grade I wins.
</P>
<P>
   The Horse of the Year decision is more subjective than that.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps never has it been as subjective as this year, when the
spate of midseason injuries and the string of Breeders' Cup upsets
left some tough choices for the turf writers, Daily Racing Form
staffers and track executives who'll do the voting in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't surprise me if 10 different horses got first-place
votes,'' jockey agent Scotty McClellan said.
</P>
<P>
   Ten might be high, but I've heard serious cases made for
Charismatic, Artax, Beautiful Pleasure, Soaring Softly,
Silverbulletday and Victory Gallop. Also, Budroyale and Mazel Trick
are being touted by their trainers.
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic, who came within a fractured ankle of sweeping the
Triple Crown, would be a reasonable sentimental pick for
sentimentalists in a year without a perfect candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Artax, who won the Breeders' Cup Sprint in a track-record
1:07.89 for 6 furlongs, the third record he set or equaled in 1999,
is the most popular Horse of the Year contender I can't get behind.
He's 4 for 15, without a victory longer than 7 furlongs.
</P>
<P>

SHARK SAYS GOODBYE TO SHERWOOD THIS WEEK
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   THOUSAND OAKS _ Sherwood Country Club says goodbye to the
Franklin Templeton Shark Shootout this week, and host Greg Norman
will attempt to exit with two consecutive championships.
</P>
<P>
   Norman, the gracious host who never won his own tournament
before last year, opens his title defense today with Steve
Elkington in the 11th and final Shootout at Sherwood.
</P>
<P>
   Norman is moving the tournament next year to his own
soon-to-be-opened Great White Course in Miami, closer to his
Florida home in Hobe Sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll miss the hospitality afforded to us at Sherwood,'' he
said, ``but believe it is in the best interest of the tournament to
relocate it to the East Coast.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman said television played a large role in the Shootout
leaving Sherwood, which had hosted the event since the course
opened in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   With the tournament on the West Coast, he said, NFL football
doubleheaders preclude live CBS coverage of the final round on
Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Norman and Elkington combined to win the 1998 Shootout in a
three-hole playoff with John Cook and Peter Jacobsen, after both
teams finished 12-under-par 58 in the final round and 27-under par
for the three-day event.
</P>
<P>
   Norman's '98 victory at Sherwood was a double comeback. It was
also his first win in his first competition since the two-time
British Open champion underwent shoulder surgery that had sidelined
him for nearly eight months.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has not won since, Norman says his game is solid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hitting up to 600 shots a day now,'' he said. ``I plan to
play a full schedule next year.''
</P>
<P>
   He and 1995 PGA champion Elkington will be facing another strong
field this week, one that includes David Duval _ ranked No.1 in the
world earlier this year _ eight-time PGA Tour driving champion John
Daly and Rookie of the Year candidate Carlos Franco, who has won
twice this year and ranks No.11 in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Duval, currently ranked No.2 in the world, will be paired with
two-time winner Fred Couples, who combined with Ray Floyd in 1990
to set a still-standing tournament record of 34-under-par 182.
</P>
<P>
   This week marks the second Sherwood competition in four months
for Duval, who faced current No.1 Tiger Woods in the Shootout at
Sherwood match-play event in August.
</P>
<P>
   Franco, who has earned $1.8 million in his first full season on
the PGA Tour, teams with Occidental College alumnus Olin Browne,
who won this year's Mastercard Colonial.
</P>
<P>
   Daly, who won this year's tour driving title with a tour-record
average of 305.6 yards, is teamed with Chip Beck.
</P>
<P>
   Other teams this week include Andrew Magee/Jay Haas, Scott
McCarron/Scott Hoch, Corey Pavin/Steve Pate, Craig Stadler/Tom
Kite, Ben Crenshaw/Bruce Lietzke, Jacobsen/Cook, Brad Faxon/Jeff
Sluman and Glen Day/Duffy Waldorf.
</P>
<P>
   Today's format will be alternate stroke, followed by best-ball
on Saturday and Sunday's crowd-favorite scramble play, where both
team members hit tee shots, then both hit again from the spot of
the team's best ball throughout each hole.
</P>
<P>
   That format has produced 33 sub-60 rounds to date, including
eight of a possible 10 in 1995 and a tournament record 17-under-par
55 by Norman and Nick Price in 1993.

MEXICAN AIRLINE ACCUSED OF LAPSES IN UPKEEP 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Mexico's third-largest airline, already facing
financial and legal pressure, is now defending itself against
assertions by a labor union that its maintenance procedures are
dangerous and deceptive.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the airline, Transportes Aereos Ejecutivos S.A.,
known as Taesa, denied the claims, which came in interviews on
Thursday with the leader of Mexico's union of flight attendants and
in a complaint filed before the U.S. Labor Department in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But the complaints drew considerable attention since they came
two days after a Taesa commuter DC9-31 crashed west of Mexico City,
killing all 18 occupants.
</P>
<P>
   Taesa's 300 flight attendants are represented by a
pro-government labor federation, but some attendants are trying to
decertify that union and affiliate with the larger, more aggressive
and politically independent Flight Attendants Union of Mexico.
Taesa is resisting the decertification drive.
</P>
<P>
   Alejandra Barrales Magdaleno, the leader of the flight
attendants union, on Thursday accused Taesa of keeping two sets of
records for the DC9-31 and for other aircraft in its fleet. She
said one set accurately reflected maintenance deficiencies, and
another set, which was turned over to federal aviation authorities
during periodic inspections, offered a false and less-troubled
assessment.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barrales said she had personally informed Mexico's director
of Civil Aviation of the group's suspicions but that he had taken
no action. A Civil Aviation spokesman said the director was
investigating the Taesa crash and was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for Taesa, Eduardo Cacho Silva, denied the
record-keeping accusation and said Taesa complies strictly with
government maintenance regulations. He said the ill-fated DC9-31
had been in good operating condition before its last flight, from
Uruapan, Michoacan, to Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are irresponsible accusations made to confuse the
public,'' Cacho said.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint filed with the Labor Department asserted that
Taesa engaged in unfair labor practices. The complaint was lodged
under a side accord of the North American Free Trade Agreement, in
which the member countries agreed to review each others' records on
labor rights and safety practices.

KEARIN KEEPS NORTHRIDGE SPIRITS UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It figures Jeff Kearin would keep a copy of
``14,000 Things to be Happy About'' within easy reach on his desk.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital)A grass field.
</P>
<P>
   Warm sunshine in November.
</P>
<P>
   An office with a door.(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   Only someone who smiles at life's simple pleasures could sit in
the non-descript trailer that houses his office, look out at the
drab stadium that houses his team and see neon lights and Broadway
somewhere off in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   Kearin, 39, is directing the football program at Cal State
Northridge, which means he can't be sure how much longer the
production will run.
</P>
<P>
   The reviews this year have been mostly positive. USC and UCLA
may be the Mark Taper Forum and Schubert Theater of football
productions, but most Saturdays the Division I-AA Matadors have
been the ones putting on the best show.
</P>
<P>
   They are the only college football team in the Southland with a
winning record, the only team unbeaten at home, the only team with
a running back averaging more than 100 yards a game, the only team
with a quarterback who has thrown nearly twice as many touchdowns
as interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   And yet to be associated with CSUN football is to tap-dance
furiously on the big stage while glancing furtively at the shadows,
in anticipation of the hook.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? Athletic director Dick Dull could drop the curtain at
the end of this season. Or in 2001, when all the CSUN sports teams
figure to join the realigned Big West Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Kearin, though, is counting on Dull being a man of his word.
</P>
<P>
   Kearin, a former CSUN assistant, left a cushy job coaching tight
ends and special teams at UNLV to return to his native Southern
California in late July after gaining assurances from Dull that the
Matadors' football program wasn't going anywhere but up.
</P>
<P>
   Left in Kearin's capable hands, that doesn't seem like such a
reach. The Matadors are 5-4 overall and 4-3 in the Big Sky heading
into Saturday's nonconference game at SMU. Jaumal Bradley is
averaging 102.3 yards rushing and Marcus Brady has thrown 23
touchdowns (against 12 interceptions) despite playing the past two
weeks on a swollen, gimpy left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Following the lead of his coach, Brady has stayed upbeat (and
upright) in spite of the pain. ``Coach, you never see him really
down or frustrated,'' Brady said. ``You never see him depressed. He
never stops going. He's got a lot of energy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Jeff has the perfect personality for that program,''
said San Diego Chargers head coach Mike Riley, who worked alongside
Kearin on John Robinson's staff at USC. ``He's great with people,
he's a hard worker and he's not an ego guy. He's not going to let
peripheral stuff get him down. His focus will be on his kids and
what he has, not the facilities and resources he doesn't have.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, you won't hear Kearin complain about CSUN's
shortcomings. He doesn't waste one second of his precious time
worrying about how the stadium and weight facilities don't compare
to those of his alma mater, Loyola High, much less Montana State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have what we need,'' Kearin said, sounding unlike any CSUN
football coach in recent memory. ``We have a field with grass in
it. We have seats in it. We don't need a new $10 million stadium.
Give us $1 million to build a press box and restrooms and hire more
people to work the concessions so my dad isn't waiting half an hour
to get a beer and a hot dog. We have to look at how we can maximize
football in a minimal way.''
</P>
<P>
   It says here Dull shouldn't waste another second signing Kearin
to a long-term contract, lest Kearin recovers his senses from
beneath the piles of paper on his desk.
</P>
<P>
   Kearin's title _ interim head coach _ doesn't begin to cover his
duties.
</P>
<P>
   Picture a playwright manning phones in the ticket office,
handing out programs and sweeping the theater after every
performance and you've got the idea.
</P>
<P>
   When we caught up with Kearin, about six hours into one of his
typical 16-hour work days, he was answering general telephone
inquiries _ ``We're back at home Nov. 20 against Northern Arizona.
You're welcome. Thank you for your interest in Matadors football''
_ and making arrangements to have a bus waiting to pick the team up
at the airport today in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Kearin is some 25 miles from USC, where he toiled four years as
a low-level assistant under Robinson. In reality, he's worlds
apart.
</P>
<P>
   At USC, head coach Paul Hackett cracks a joke about how you know
the losses are mounting when luncheon meat replaces hot dishes in
the weekly media buffet. At CSUN, Kearin jokes that the football
department's VCR better not start eating his game tapes because he
can't afford a new one.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's OK,'' Kearin said, smiling. ``When you come to this
level of football, it's definitely a reality check.''
</P>
<P>
   Kearin may wear rosy-colored glasses, but he isn't blind. He
knows the football team has to reach out to the community if it
expects to be embraced. So he had his players practice one day
alongside a local Pop Warner team.
</P>
<P>
   He realizes the school is easily overlooked by top high-school
prospects. So he's lobbying hard for CSUN to bid on hosting the
participants of the game between Texas and California high school
standouts, to be played at Cerritos College in June.
</P>
<P>
   Kearin understands it's important for his players to be good
citizens. It's one of his pet sermons. So he was heartened,
recently, when he found out a student challenged a football player
at a fraternity party, only to have another teammate step in and
escort the player away before tempers could get out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   He knows accountability starts with him. So he was full of
apologies after letting the officiating become a distraction during
last week's 13-point loss at Portland State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really thought I dropped the ball,'' Kearin said three days
later. ``I grew up a little that day.''
</P>
<P>
   Kearin would like to mature along with the Matadors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could be happy here the rest of my life,'' he said. ``I know
you think I'm full of it, but it's the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   It'd be sad for CSUN if he blossoms somewhere else, just as it's
a shame USC isn't profiting from Riley's polish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are looking for those good stories,'' said
Riley, who spent a year raising expectations at Oregon State before
moving to the Chargers. ``They recognize hard jobs being done
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Memo to Dull: That's not just an observation, it's a warning. &QL;

ANOTHER FINE MESS FOR SHAQ
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The NBA gave Shaquille O'Neal a slap on the wrist
Thursday. His coach may want to give him a slap someplace else.
</P>
<P>
   A day after being ejected for the second time in three games
after scuffling with Charles Barkley in an 89-88 victory over
Houston, O'Neal was suspended for one game without pay and fined
$10,000. Barkley also received a one-game suspension without pay
and a $5,000 fine for his part in the wrestling match. O'Neal
received the greater fine for throwing the first punch and getting
involved in a fight. Barkley was fined for throwing the basketball
and fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Although O'Neal said there is no problem, Lakers coach Phil
Jackson isn't so sure, hinting that frustration over O'Neal's poor
foul shooting and opponents' constant fouling tactics may be taking
their toll on his center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a lot of pressure in this business and there's
a lot of focus on Shaquille, but you just can't take yourself that
seriously,'' Jackson said. ``It's a game and you still have to
remember that there's a certain lightness or playfulness to it, and
that's one of the things that I keep trying to bring back to these
players, the playful aspect of basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those things, it happens in slow motion, you look
at it and say `Oh, Charles just threw the ball at Shaq, that's
going to put him out of the game. But what's Shaq doing?' I
couldn't imagine what he was doing, because certainly he's been in
situations (like that) before. But obviously there was a lot of
pressure there, and he reacted.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal and Barkley will sit out tonight's Lakers-Rockets game at
Staples Center. Dating back to last year, O'Neal has been tossed
from three of the Lakers' last 14 regular-season games. He was
ejected from last Saturday's loss at Portland after throwing a ball
at Jermaine O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   That's hardly the playful demeanor Jackson is seeking, although
O'Neal insisted Barkley caused the altercation by throwing a ball
at his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get frustrated,'' O'Neal said. ``If anyone is
frustrated, it's him. It's his team that's 0-5. My team is 5-1.
Besides, life is too short to be frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammate Kobe Bryant said people should not over-analyze
O'Neal's actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think he wanted to punch (Barkley) in the mouth,'' said
Bryant, laughing. ``You don't have to read too much into it.''
</P>
<P>
   However, some of his teammates weren't smiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is that we have to hold one another
accountable and responsible for their actions,'' said veteran A.C.
Green, whom the Lakers traded for during the offseason. ``I don't
know how it was (here) last year, but that's the way it's going to
be this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Lakers vice president Jerry West hopes O'Neal will learn from
the last two ejections.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only advice to any player is that part of being a
professional and a person of stature in this league is how you
handle these kinds of stressful situations,'' West said. ``They
happen so fast, that anyone can go off. He just can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   With O'Neal out, Jackson will use a combination of John Salley,
Travis Knight and Green on Hakeem Olajuwon tonight. Robert Horry
might be activated off the injured list today, depending on how his
sore left knee responds to Thursday's light workout. His return
would give Jackson other options in the frontcourt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll put the guy out there that's got the most nerve,''
Jackson said.

PEARLS STOLEN BY JEWELRY RING, POLICE SAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Police believe that a band of gun-toting Colombian jewelry
thieves hit the Los Angeles region again Thursday night, robbing a
man of $600,000 in pearl necklaces on a freeway transition road in
South Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The heist is the latest in a string of holdups around Los
Angeles and the San Fernando Valley, netting about $500 million
annually, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having a lot of these robberies,'' said Los Angeles
Detective Michael Woodings, part of a 15-member jewelry heist task
force. ``We've got some good information regarding some aspects of
who the suspects are, but all we know is we've got violent
criminals who are good at what they do.''
</P>
<P>
   The thieves tail jewelers from areas such as the Los Angeles
Jewelry Mart to the jewelers' homes. They also have been known to
disable the victim's car by slashing a tire or ripping out a
radiator hose.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest heist at 8 p.m. Thursday, a jewelry salesman had
hailed a cab downtown and was en route to Los Angeles International
Airport to catch a flight to New York. Four gunmen in a
dark-colored Chevrolet Blazer boxed in the taxi on the transition
from the southbound Harbor Freeway to the eastbound Glenn Anderson
Freeway.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen, including one wearing a dark-colored ski mask and a
hood, approached the cab, took the keys, opened the trunk and
grabbed two suitcases containing pearl necklaces valued at
$600,000. The robbers then fled.
</P>
<P>
   Police have recorded more than six such incidents in the Valley
so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   In February, gunmen carjacked a jewelry courier at his home in
Woodland Hills and stole $100,000 in goods. In March, thieves
confronted a courier at his home in Encino and stole an undisclosed
amount of goods. In April, a crook carrying a shotgun stole
$300,000 in jewelry from a courier in Chatsworth.
</P>
<P>
   That same month in Thousand Oaks, a gunman forced a courier into
his trunk and stole $500,000 worth of jewelry. On April 26, robbers
were foiled in Van Nuys when they took an empty jewelry case from a
courier who had dropped off his goods for the day. Later that
month, a gunman took $20,000 in gold and jewelry from a courier in
Reseda.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities believe that a network of about 200 thieves they
describe as Colombians who live in Los Angeles make their living by
selling stolen items to a single person, earning about 25 cents on
the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Because the group consists of many leaders and is egalitarian in
its operations, all participants in a robbery receive equal pay for
equal work, police said.
</P>
<P>
   They are so sophisticated, police say, that some of their
surveillance and countersurveillance capabilities make it difficult
for police to catch them.
</P>
<P>
   One theory is that the gang prefers to recruit former Colombian
police and soldiers because they typically are disciplined and
steer clear of drugs and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're working for a bigger network,'' said Moshe Pereg,
president of the Jewelry Manufacturers Guild in Los Angeles.
``Organized crime in Colombia is very developed.''

grabbed two suitcases containing pearl necklaces valued at
$600,000. The robbers then fled.
</P>
<P>
   Police have recorded more than six such incidents in the Valley
so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   In February, gunmen carjacked a jewelry courier at his home in
Woodland Hills and stole $100,000 in goods. In March, thieves
confronted a courier at his home in Encino and stole an undisclosed
amount of goods. In April, a crook carrying a shotgun stole
$300,000 in jewelry from a courier in Chatsworth.
</P>
<P>
   That same month in Thousand Oaks, a gunman forced a courier into
his trunk and stole $500,000 worth of jewelry. On April 26, robbers
were foiled in Van Nuys when they took an empty jewelry case from a
courier who had dropped off his goods for the day. Later that
month, a gunman took $20,000 in gold and jewelry from a courier in
Reseda.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities believe that a network of about 200 thieves they
describe as Colombians who live in Los Angeles make their living by
selling stolen items to a single person, earning about 25 cents on
the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Because the group consists of many leaders and is egalitarian in
its operations, all participants in a robbery receive equal pay for
equal work, police said.
</P>
<P>
   They are so sophisticated, police say, that some of their
surveillance and countersurveillance capabilities make it difficult
for police to catch them.
</P>
<P>
   One theory is that the gang prefers to recruit former Colombian
police and soldiers because they typically are disciplined and
steer clear of drugs and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're working for a bigger network,'' said Moshe Pereg,
president of the Jewelry Manufacturers Guild in Los Angeles.
``Organized crime in Colombia is very developed.''

SALEM SHARES SLIDE AFTER REPORTER LOSSS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Shares of Salem Communications Corp. fell 26
percent Thursday, the first trading day after the religious
broadcaster based north of Los Angeles reported a surprising loss.
</P>
<P>
   Shares fell $6.75 to $19.50 in Nasdaq trading of 2.5 million
shares, compared with the three-month daily average of 91,000
shares.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which operates 49 stations nationwide, announced
late Wednesday a net loss of $3.7 million, or 16 cents per share,
for the third-quarter of 1999, compared with net income of
$184,000, or 1 cent per share, for the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dirk Gastaldo, Salem's chief financial officer, said $3.6
million of the loss was attributed to the early retirement of debt,
and $138,000 was from company operations.
</P>
<P>
   Salem also invested $1.5 million in the third quarter in its Web
site OnePlace.com, he said. The company is attempting to position
OnePlace.com as the premier online Christian broadcast and
e-commerce Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The religious broadcaster also bought two FM stations in
Louisville, Ky., for $5 million, KCTK-AM (960/1360) in Phoenix for
an undisclosed amount, and reached a local market agreement with
KCBQ-AM in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Gastaldo said none of the radio transactions attributed to the
company's third-quarter loss.
</P>
<P>
   Salem is based in Camarillo, about 50 miles north of Los
Angeles. In Southern California, Salem operates Glendale-based
stations KIEV-AM (870), KLTX-AM (1390) and KKLA-FM (99.5), along
with KDAR-FM (98.3), covering Ventura and Santa Barbara counties.
The company also operates the Salem Radio Network, a national radio
network offering programming to 1,200 affiliated radio stations.

MICROSOFT'S BIGGEST SIN WAS SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: The sad irony of government antitrust actions is that
those prosecuting and judging these cases have never met a payroll
or created a scintilla of wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, they find themselves empowered to destroy or
cripple a wealth-creating enterprise and diminish the financial
fortunes of millions of workers and investors.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Microsoft's prosecution, the judge apparently
even sees himself as more of a software expert than the real
experts. What worries Microsoft's friends and foes alike is the
judge's critical assessment of the integration of the Internet
browser and operating system.
</P>
<P>
   One of his findings of ``fact'' claimed putting the browser into
the operating system ``unjustifiably jeopardized the stability and
security of the operating system.'' This attempt by a judge to
instruct the industry in how best to engineer its products raised
more than a few eyebrows among information technology experts.
</P>
<P>
   While everyone is uncomfortable with ``the choke hold Microsoft
has,'' said the dean of the school of information management and
systems at the University of California-Berkeley, ``they are also
uncomfortable with having government get involved in software
design decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   In another somewhat puzzling twist of logic, Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson faults Microsoft for pricing its wares both too
high and too low. Thus, in the judge's eyes, Microsoft is guilty of
both charging too much and too little. This is what happens when
legal power trumps market power. The law becomes what the judge and
prosecution say it is.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is the company many love to hate. Columns taking
Microsoft's side during the company's legal troubles of recent
years evoked as much vitriolic denunciation as columns urging fair
play for the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   The paradox of the substantial ill will toward Microsoft,
though, is how the company still managed to become one of the most
successful entrepreneurial undertakings of the 20th century. In the
process, it became the corporation with the highest stock market
capitalization.
</P>
<P>
   In a fledgling industry for which innovation is a life-and-death
matter, Microsoft came to rule its markets. Its sometimes ruthless
business practices made it many enemies; its contempt for political
niceties has sown the seeds of its potential destruction.
</P>
<P>
   What Microsoft really stands guilty of isn't violation of
antitrust laws, which is essentially a subjective matter. What's
it's really guilty of is ruthlessness and arrogance. In other
words, it acted as any powerful business tends to act. In the real
world, this means Microsoft's legal vulnerability has more to do
with politics than economics.
</P>
<P>
   If Microsoft falls, many may cheer, but it will be a Pyrrhic
victory for society at large. To the extent that government is
allowed to destroy the value Microsoft's employees have created, it
will diminish the financial fortunes of millions of hapless
bystanders.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's high-flying stock has become one of the most popular
among managers of pension funds and mutual funds, as well as people
creating nest eggs for college educations and retirements.
Economics, as always, is about tradeoffs.

GARNETT WINS LATE DUEL WITH CAMBY AS TIMBERWOLVES EDGE KNICKS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ For most of the game, the Knicks' Marcus Camby and
the Timberwolves' Kevin Garnett kept their distance Thursday night.
But in the crush of the moment, they were one-on-one, two young
stars so spindly and sturdy you could run a flag up their frames.
Two stars under pressure so intense one was bound to come out with
a game-turning moment.
</P>
<P>
   So with the ball in his hands on the baseline and Camby as close
as the rules allow, Garnett faked to his right and spun to his left
and into the paint. He stepped back and launched a fade-away shot
that arched over Camby's wingspan and an oncoming double team. As
Garnett hit the floor, his 6-foot shot landed in the net with 24.9
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Right then, it was decided. This would be Garnett's moment, his
turn to come up with a game-deciding shot and disappoint a Knicks
team that had the game wrapped up with a bow on top midway through
the fourth quarter, only to lose, 93-90.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets back to the Michael Jordan thing,'' Knicks coach Jeff
Van Gundy said of Garnett. ``I don't think he ever wanted it more
than anyone else. I just think he was better than anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   No one was better than Garnett Thursday night. He finished with
35 points, 14 rebounds and two blocked shots _ one against Camby
with five seconds left. And 15 points came in a fourth quarter in
which the Knicks shot just 6 for 20. The Knicks, led by Allan
Houston's 29 points, folded down the stretch after having a
12-point lead early in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing,'' said Latrell Sprewell, who was 0 for 5
in the fourth quarter and missed a potentially game-tying 3-point
attempt as time ran out. ``We had them. This is a game that was
ours.''
</P>
<P>
   A game Garnett single-handedly took away. After Houston was
forced to sit down in the fourth quarter with foul trouble, the
Knicks could not generate another offensive source. After Garnett
had been guarded by Larry Johnson and Kurt Thomas _ both fouled out
_ he started to take his toll on Camby, too.
</P>
<P>
   Garnett ended a 19-6 run by the Timberwolves with a 6-foot hook
shot with four minutes left to give his team an 85-84 lead. His
shot with 24.9 seconds left was the one from which the Knicks never
recovered as it gave Minnesota a 91-88 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was everywhere in the end,'' Camby said. ``I thought I had
him played tight, as tight as I could. It was a tough shot he made
to decide it. I think he was on the ground when he let it go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' defense was up against one of its great challenges
of the season in a talented team led by a superstar who plays with
the versatility of a Swiss Army knife. Garnett can hold down center
and forward and can cover guards. He dunks with a vicious flair,
hits a soft baseline jumper and can even pop a shot from 3-point
range. And he can do it at all from the vantage point of his
6-foot-11-inch frame.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can be listed at whatever he wants,'' said Van Gundy, who,
like most in the league, measures Garnett at 7-1. `'I'll say this,
he'll be the tallest guy on the floor tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Garnett stood out in every way, scoring around the Knicks'
musical-chair defense. They rotated Johnson until he found early
foul trouble, and then Thomas and Camby. But no on was going to
stop Garnett completely. That much the Knicks knew.
</P>
<P>
   The bold Wally Szczerbiak, the broad-shouldered rookie forward
from Cold Spring Harbor on Long Island, was more of a mystery. Few
knew how well he would play but Szczerbiak himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``My philosophy is to go at him,'' Szczerbiak said before the
game ``Sprewell is a 40-minute player. He doesn't want to get into
foul trouble. He wants to rest on defense and play offense. His
game is offense. I think I pose some matchup problems for him.''
</P>
<P>
   At a muscular 6-7 and 244 pounds, Szczerbiak revealed a
deceptively quick first step to go with his shooting range. And at
times he got the best of Sprewell. The tandem of Garnett and
Szczerbiak kept the Knicks from blowing the game out of hand by
combining for 43 points through three quarters, but they could not
keep up with the Knicks, who had a 74-66 lead entering the final
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   What the Knicks did was more than match Minnesota's star power.
Houston helped put the Knicks in front, 31-19, after scoring 16
points in the first quarter around a helpless Anthony Peeler. His
scoring spree included eight points in the final 2 minutes 36
seconds of the quarter to set up the Knicks for the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   While Houston rested early in the second quarter, and did not
score another point in the first half, the Knicks slipped a bit to
finish the half ahead by 51-45 after having a double-digit lead
most of the way. Until the last eight minutes of the half, the
Knicks were clicking as well offensively as they had all season,
even without Houston's points.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, Chris Childs and Sprewell, moving the ball in sync,
helped the Knicks to a 14-point lead midway through the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Was this a product of the Timberwolves' jet lag from their trip
to Japan to open the season? Were they rusty from their four-day
layoff? Minnesota was supposed to be one of those Western
Conference teams equipped to beat the elite from the East. Whatever
excuse the Timberwolves wanted to use, the Knicks were in an
unflappable groove until the final minutes of the first half.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Szczerbiak and Garnett combined to cut into the
Knicks' lead. Szczerbiak, cutting across the lane, slipped around
the pedestrian defense of John Wallace for one dunk and then did
the same thing to Sprewell a couple of minutes later. Meanwhile,
Garnett was flaunting his versatility by knocking down a 3-pointer
with 1:30 left in the half to end an 18-8 run and allow Minnesota
to close to 49-43. After Sprewell scored four points to end the
half, the Knicks led, 51-45.

DAVIS SAYS HE'LL STAY AT USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC defensive tackle Ennis Davis admitted that he
considered turning pro after the season, but said Thursday he
expects to return for his senior year.
</P>
<P>
   The preseason All-American from Reseda High has intercepted two
passes, an unusual stat for a lineman, but has never been 100
percent while recovering from knee surgery following last year's
Sun Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm coming back. I've pretty much made my decision. I don't
see a reason to leave yet,'' Davis said. ``It probably would be a
whole different situation if I played as well as I can. It's a
disappointing season for me. I want to be healthy when I go to the
(NFL) combines.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say I could go in the first round this year, but I
could go a lot higher next year when I'm healthy. Of course, it's a
childhood dream to play in the NFL, but I want to maximize what I
can get out of myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said he is close to recovering from torn knee ligaments in
his left knee but probably won't regain full strength until after
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel 100 percent, but I feel good,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer throws: In a slight change from the original plan,
injured quarterback Carson Palmer threw a football 30 times at a
distance of 10 yards Thursday as part of his rehabilitation from a
broken collarbone.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The doctors) felt this would be an action they couldn't
simulate without throwing,'' coach Paul Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   The exercise does not change Palmer's status, with Sunday still
a key day for the quarterback to try to throw. Even if Palmer does
throw, there's doubts his shoulder could endure a full practice
next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is can he be ready for Tuesday?'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Pep talk: Hackett met with the team's seniors after practice to
offers some words of encouragement before USC plays at Washington
State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `This is our last road trip together guys, let's make
it be a memorable one,''' Hackett said. ``I think they have done a
great job focusing on the team. I said they should get the most out
of these last three games.''
</P>
<P>
   Deja vu? Hackett's 3-6 record this season is identical to the
3-6 record his final Pitt team had in 1992. That team finished 3-9.
</P>
<P>
   Filling the roster: Defensive tackle Aaron Williams (neck) and
wide receiver Marcell Allmond (shoulder) will not make the trip but
should return next week. Defensive end Matt Childers (shoulder)
will probably not make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   USC will take Palmer and injured tailback Petros Papadakis. Even
though both players are out, they will count against the 60-man
limit the Pac-10 allows for road games.

SPRINT GEARS UP TO TAKE ORDERS FOR BUNDLED SERVICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TED SICKINGER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Sprint Corp. will start taking orders from
consumers in Kansas City, Denver and Seattle on Monday for its
long-awaited, much-touted Integrated On-Demand Network.
</P>
<P>
   ION, as it is known, is a sort of Veg-O-Matic of phone services,
an all-in-one package delivered through a single connection to the
home, with one bill and one flat-rate price.
</P>
<P>
   The service bundles high-speed Internet access, up to four phone
lines and 2,200 minutes of local and long-distance calling for
$159.99 a month.
</P>
<P>
   With installations beginning in December, Sprint is one of the
first companies to deliver such an integrated package to
residential consumers. But the concept is one that almost every
phone company is working on, testing or getting ready to deliver in
selected markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is interesting. It's truly something consumers haven't
seen before,'' said Boyd Peterson, an analyst with the Yankee
Group. ``It's going to take some education. Consumers are going to
be forced to make a comparison, but there's no other service
provider you can compare this to.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Southwestern Bell's DSL and Time Warner's Road Runner
services, which are considerably cheaper, ION will offer consumers
unlimited, superfast Internet access that is always connected,
eliminating busy signals and other service interruptions common
with dial-up modems.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint says ION will offer download speeds ranging from 1.5 to 8
megabits a second, a fat enough pipe to grab large information and
entertainment files from the Internet in seconds, compared with
minutes or hours using a conventional modem.
</P>
<P>
   Upstream, or sending speeds, will be about 684 kilobits a
second, fast enough for fairly seamless videoconferencing or
desktop collaboration between home and office.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the phone and cable companies' services, however, ION
will allow consumers to reallocate their available bandwidth as
they choose, using a computer mouse to connect up to four separate
phone lines, all of which they can use simultaneously with their
Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   The package includes 2,200 minutes of calls a month, either
local or long-distance. Additional minutes are 10 cents a minute.
</P>
<P>
   The $160 monthly price tag doesn't include one-time charges of
$250 for an integrated access hub and installation costs of $150.
</P>
<P>
   But Sprint says it is marketing the service to users who already
spend upward of $200 for multiple phone lines, Internet service and
long-distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price point and the number of minutes included are based
on usage patterns that we know from our own experience with
customers and other industry research,'' said Steve Lunceford, a
Sprint spokesman. ``We think it's in line with the type of
customers we're targeting. If we find that people want more
minutes, that could certainly be adjusted.''
</P>
<P>
   To provide the service, Sprint will deploy electronics that
increase the capacity of the copper phone lines that run from the
local phone company's central offices to most homes. The
technology, known as a digital subscriber line, is the same as used
by Southwestern Bell to offer its high-speed Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   As with Bell's service, the technology has limitations. To
qualify for the service, customers must live within three miles of
one of Southwestern Bell's central offices, and their line must be
free of interference and electronics that are often used to extend
the range of standard phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint says it can reach up to 70 percent of the customers in
metropolitan Kansas City, although analysts say that may be wildly
optimistic based on past experience with similar technologies in
other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint will need to qualify each customer for the service ahead
of time. Initially, it will take up to 45 days between the time
customers sign up for the service and it is installed, although
Sprint says it will cut that time in half as it gets up to speed.
</P>
<P>
   Competition for high-end residential customers is heating up
around the country. But according to Peterson at the Yankee Group,
Sprint is setting a new standard with ION.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other companies are going to have to respond in kind with an
integrated offer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T plans to use cable television lines to deliver video, voice
and Internet services to residential services.
</P>
<P>
   Southwestern Bell offers a package of local phone and high-speed
Internet service for $88.95 a month on the Missouri side of the
state line. It also plans to add multiple phone lines and
long-distance to its package as soon as regulators and technology
allows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The package we've come up with best represents the needs of
our customers,'' said Ellen Pantaenius of Fleishman Hillard,
Southwestern Bell's public relations firm. ``As soon as we're able
to offer long-distance, that will certainly be included in the ...
package.''

CASINO, KANSAS CITY AGENCY AGREE ON GOALS FOR MINORITIES AND
WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Station Casino and a Kansas City Port
Authority committee reached a new agreement Thursday spelling out
how minority and women business owners and investors are to be
given a bigger slice of the economic pie.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are holding their feet to the fire more than in past
years,'' Port Authority Chairman Bill Johnson said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Since it opened in January 1997, Station has met Port Authority
goals for hiring women and minorities. But the casino has fallen
far short of purchasing goals for minority- and women-owned
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The casino's agreement in 1996 to draw minorities into its local
ownership mix was put on hold by the Port Authority last year when
no investors were found. That situation has changed dramatically in
the past year with the casino's financial success, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The new agreement will be presented to the Port Authority's
board Monday for a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Board members also are expected to vote on whether to endorse
Station's $22.5 million purchase bid for the Flamingo Hilton
Casino, which leases public land through the city agency.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Gaming Commission is scheduled to meet Wednesday
and could call for a final vote on the purchase, which Station
executives have said they hope to complete by Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Gaming Commission is not likely to approve the purchase
without the local agency's endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   The Flamingo sale issue this fall gave critics a public forum to
air grievances about both casinos' dismal record in doing business
with minority- and women-owned business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had nice warm fuzzy talks'' with Station in recent
weeks, said Marie Young, executive director of the Black Chamber of
Commerce of Greater Kansas City. ``It's great that we're having
this dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Black Chamber is willing to work with Station to reach
compliance with the new goals, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Young made it clear her organization, which represents about
500 businesses, expected results _ and fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the paper in the world doesn't mean a thing,'' she said,
waving a copy of the new agreement. ``They're going to have to
perform.''
</P>
<P>
   The original agreement called for Station to commit 35 percent
of its purchasing dollars to disadvantaged firms and 45 percent for
the Flamingo.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Port Authority's latest audit by G&AMP;H Consulting
LLC, for the third quarter of 1999, Station was at 8.3 percent and
Flamingo was at 20.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier audits that also took significant construction
spending into account, Station achieved averages of about 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The new agreement equalizes goals for both casinos and lowers
them slightly.
</P>
<P>
   But it also requires greater outreach efforts by Station to
identify and aid in the development of more minority- and
women-owned business partners.
</P>
<P>
   The new minority-firm purchasing goals are set at 23.9 percent,
down from 25 percent for Station and 35 percent for the Flamingo in
the old agreement, and 9.9 percent from women-owned firms, down
from 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Port Authority officials said the new figures were based in part
on the formula used by City Hall in its purchasing decisions. They
also reflect unique casino needs _ such as slot machines or dice _
that are not commonly available from most vendors.
</P>
<P>
   ``These numbers are very difficult to reach,'' said Troy A.
Stremming, Station's counsel for Midwest operations. ``We are doing
everything we can to get there.''

   Mercedes Villegas and her husband, Arthur, drove around the San
Fernando Valley on Thursday night trying to score Pokemon for their
kids at Burger King.
</P>
<P>
   They went to a Burger King in Van Nuys, but they were out. They
went to another one in Panorama City: no luck. Their next stop
failed too.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have any here either,'' Mercedes moaned at her
final stop at a Burger King on Roscoe and Sepulveda boulevards in
Panorama City. ``I don't know what I'm going to tell my kids.''
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Wednesday's record-breaking debut of ``Pokemon:
The First Movie,'' parents and children on Thursday stormed Burger
Kings all over the Los Angeles region where Pokemon promotional
toys were being sold with a children's meal for $2.70.
</P>
<P>
   And at the fast-food restaurants across Los Angeles they were
exhausting supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were about 10-15 kids crying and screaming here,'' said
Carlos Morelli, 42, the manager of the Burger King on Roscoe at
Sepulveda. ``Today was overwhelming. They get upset when they can't
get the toy. I think I'm supposed to get a big shipment in
tomorrow. I sure hope so.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's debut of ``Pokemon: The First Movie'' grossed more
than $10 million, the biggest Wednesday opening ever for a Warner
Bros. movie and the biggest Wednesday opening for any animated film
in history. The film outpaced its nearest competition, ``The Lion
King'' by nearly $4million.
</P>
<P>
   Young Park, 8, of Sylmar has seen the movie twice already. She
and her 3-year-old brother, Andrew, with mother, Grace, in tow came
to the Burger King Thursday night anticipating a Pokemon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't care much if they're out,'' Young said. ``But
I'm still upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Created in Japan, Pokemon, or little pocket monsters, are
brightly colored creatures that sometimes look sort of like
something you'd see in nature and sometimes are out of this world.
</P>
<P>
   In the original pair of games created for role-playing
adventures on Nintendo's hand-held video game machine, you can
collect 151 kinds of Pokemon creatures that are further broken into
about 15 almost elemental types, such as fire and water. The
pikachu is one species of Pokemon, of the electric phylum, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   Pikachu was on the minds of many children Thursday night, as
Burger Kings all over the place, after selling hundreds of the toys
throughout the day, were out of stock by dinner time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like it,'' said Ruben Rodriguez, 5, of Van Nuys, who
gasped when he heard that there weren't any more Pokemon toys at
the Burger King on Roscoe Boulevard in Panorama City. ``I'm sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Some fans of the Pokemon phenomena have taken it to darker
extremes.
</P>
<P>
   In Rancho Palos Verdes, the fever has landed two youngsters in
hot water with the law. The two students from Dodson Middle School
were arrested for allegedly stealing more than 150 Pokemon trading
cards from the backpacks of students at nearby elementary schools,
said sheriff's Deputy Brenda Parker.
</P>
<P>
   A Dodson vice principal called the sheriff's department Monday
to report what he believed was a ``burglary ring.''
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the hype, many schools have banned the cards from
campuses because they have led to thefts and fights.
</P>
<P>
   Another promotional hit, Pokemon trading cards offered to
moviegoers, are also so hot they are moving faster than anyone
anticipated. Movie executives are stepping up supplies by creating
a program to mail cards to qualifying ticket purchasers,
redistribute existing supplies and possibly releasing additional
cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thrilled to see that our value-added marketing campaign
has been so appealing,'' said Brad Ball, head of Pokemon's
promotional team.

Y2K DOOMSAYER NOW THINKS IT WILL CAUSE ONLY A SIX-MONTH RECESSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 ByFINN BULLERS and DAVID HAYES  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Ed Yardeni is mellowing. But only a little.
</P>
<P>
   The economic doomsayer of Y2K, who only six months ago was
predicting a yearlong global recession caused by the year 2000
computer problem, now thinks Y2K will result in only a six-month
recession.
</P>
<P>
   Yardeni, chief economist for Deutsche Bank in New York City,
made the prediction Thursday at a luncheon session of the Kansas
City Society of Financial Analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Yardeni is predicting a ``very intense recession'' that will
spark a 25 percent to 30 percent drop in the stock market early
next year _ to ``8,000 on the Dow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I still see a 70 percent chance of recession. I'm just not as
concerned about a 12-month or longer recession. The bulk of it will
be concentrated in a six-month period, and it could linger for the
second half,'' Yardeni said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's enough to rule out doomsday scenarios, but not
enough to join the `don't worry, be happy' crowd,'' said Yardeni,
the most prominent expert predicting a Y2K-related economic
downturn.
</P>
<P>
   Yardeni, a prominent Wall Street watcher who was among the first
economists to sound warnings about Y2K, has been focusing for the
last year on what could go wrong in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's encouraging that so many people are so optimistic,''
Yardeni said. ``Maybe I should join the chorus of complacency, but
I'm skeptical.''
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   Good data is hard to come by, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other financial documents filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission by American corporations, SEC-required
quarterly Y2K disclosures aren't audited or independently verified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't buy into this universal trust,'' Yardeni said.
``If that's the case, let's drop federal regulations and 10Q
(quarterly financial report) filings and companies can say, `We did
better then last year, trust us.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Never in the course of human history have so many of us
depended on so many other humans not to screw up.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal Y2K watchdogs have made Yardeni stand out in the crowd
with their glowing assessments of year 2000 readiness. For example,
the White House this week issued its final Y2K assessment. For the
most part, the report said, everything will be OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am confident the Y2K problem will not put the savings or the
safety of the American people at risk,'' President Clinton said
Wednesday. ``The American people can have full faith that
everything from air traffic control systems to Social Security
payment systems will continue to work exactly as they should.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrong message, Yardeni said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of preparing for plausible worst-case scenarios,
government and business leaders have convinced the public to expect
the best possible outcome,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yardeni concedes that a lot of progress has been made in the
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, I have to say I haven't seen any Y2K behavior that's
impacted the economy,'' he said. One of the biggest surprises, he
said, is that Y2K-nervous investors haven't bolted from the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   Domestically, Yardeni said he was encouraged by progress made in
critical infrastructure systems such as electricity and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   But with 49 days to go before Jan. 1, he expects to see a mad
dash to the finish line. Yardeni thinks any number of things could
go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the year 2000, my main concern is disruption in the supply
chain,'' Yardeni said. ``I believe there are going to be weak
links.''
</P>
<P>
   A disruption in manufacturing supply lines could reduce
production. That means recession.
</P>
<P>
   But a disruption in just-in-time manufacturing isn't the only
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K problems after the first of the year could cause investors
to jump out of the market, causing the Dow to drop and depressing
consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
   Or there may just be a knee-jerk reaction. After Jan. 1,
consumers may wake up and suddenly become conservative.
</P>
<P>
   But the Achilles heel of Y2K could be the weak links in the
global supply chain that might, he said, disrupt just-in-time
manufacturing and petroleum production and distribution.
</P>
<P>
   There almost undoubtedly will be Y2K problems in China, Yardeni
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we can work around those problems, maybe we can't,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another expected trouble spot, Indonesia, is a different story.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia provides the bulk of natural gas supplies to Japan and
North Korea, and the response to Y2K from the Indonesian government
is to simply fix problems as they crop up.
</P>
<P>
   Italy is another spot that federal Y2K watchers are picking on
because the country got a late start on fixing computer systems.
But Yardeni points out that Washington only woke up to the problem
last February.
</P>
<P>
   In a wide-ranging talk in which Yardeni said he sometimes had
trouble finding problems in the economy to worry about, he said he
was amazed by those who equate talk of recession with the end of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned that the market is so much into this (rapid
growth) that a six-month recession is viewed as doomsday,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Yardeni isn't all doom and gloom.
</P>
<P>
   If the Dow does drop to 8,000, ``I see some great buying
opportunities on the way to 15,000 by the year 2005,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Yardeni is covering his bets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really hope we are lucky and nothing goes wrong. I really
don't mind being wrong on this,'' he said. ``I may have to do some
dancing around at the end of the year and take some ribs, but I
don't mind.''

NEW AVIATION DIRECTOR FACES BIG CHALLENGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MIKE RICE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Shortly after Russell Widmar became Kansas
City's new aviation director, he singled out a staffer's
performance at a City Council committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
   That employee had successfully applied for a state grant that
will pay $640,000 to convert the department's diesel bus-fuel
system to compressed natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let people know if staff does a good job,'' said Widmar, who
came to Kansas City in August after working as executive director
of the Salt Lake City Airport Authority. ``You have to take
interest in what they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Such words should be welcome in a department that has been beset
with morale problems. In the two years before Widmar arrived, 200
of the Aviation Department's 460 full-time employees left.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing stability to the department is just one of several
challenges that Widmar faces _ including a $156 million renovation
of Kansas City International Airport, maintaining the Downtown
Airport as a prime facility for corporate aviation and transforming
Richards-Gebaur Memorial Airport into an intermodal transportation
hub.
</P>
<P>
   Widmar, 53, has held executive positions with Hughes Aircraft
Co. in Fullerton, Calif.; Lockheed Air Terminal Inc. in Burbank,
Calif.; and Los Angeles' Department of Airports, where he began his
aviation career in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City is his first job in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, my impressions of Kansas City have been very
positive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And so far, city leaders like what they have seen of Widmar.
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Teresa Loar, who chairs the Aviation Committee,
said she has already received memos from Widmar about the
accomplishments of some staff members.
</P>
<P>
   Widmar ``has excellent credentials and a keen understanding of
aviation issues,'' Loar said. ``And he has made it a priority to
stabilize staff, and so far he has done a good job at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City's airports, Widmar said, are filled with potential _
especially KCI, with its three circular terminals and its
drive-to-the-gate convenience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The buildings have a wonderful and unique design to them,'' he
said. ``There is no other airport in the United States like KCI.
Where else can you park this close to a gate?''
</P>
<P>
   Widmar said the renovations, which are scheduled to begin in
late 2000 and be completed in 2004, will maintain the
drive-to-the-gate system.
</P>
<P>
   And in an era when airport officials throughout the country are
crying for extra gates, Widmar thinks KCI has enough gates to get
through the next eight years. The renovations would leave six
unassigned gates, which would allow for an airline to expand.
</P>
<P>
   And KCI, he said, could install loading bridges for crews to
connect planes with terminals. That way, crews would not have to
work in inclement weather.
</P>
<P>
   Widmar said the city will continue to invest in the 72-year-old
Downtown Airport. The old control tower soon will be demolished,
and other improvements will be made.
</P>
<P>
   ``That airport is very convenient for corporate America,''
Widmar said. ``It is one of the premier general-aviation facilities
in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Flying operations at Richards-Gebaur Memorial Airport will close
at the end of the year. Voters in August approved a measure that
will turn the airport into an intermodal hub.
</P>
<P>
   The plans call for another runway to be built, although skeptics
have questioned whether the Federal Aviation Administration will be
willing to help pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council, however, has approved a master plan for the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a strong sense of what can be done there,''
Widmar said. ``But the city just approved the master plan, so I
don't want to prejudge anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Widmar also has told city leaders that voters might have to
approve an increase in the city's bonded-indebtedness capacity for
the airport. That capacity right now is near $200 million, but two
projects alone _ the KCI terminal renovations and a proposed
consolidated car-rental system _ would cost that amount.
</P>
<P>
   Other top priorities, he said, are maintaining the Trans World
Airlines overhaul base, maintaining KCI's successful cargo
operation, and land acquisitions. The city was recently embarrassed
when it failed to buy land near Interstate 29 that a private
parking company eventually bought.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his resignation earlier this year in Salt Lake City amid
staff dissension over a proposed $1.03 billion expansion of Salt
Lake City International Airport, Widmar said he remains proud of
the work he did there.
</P>
<P>
   But Widmar, who recently finished moving out of his Salt Lake
City home, said he is focused on Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am looking forward to being here,'' he said.

   LAS VEGAS _ ``Boxing,'' Evander Holyfield mused this week, ``is
a replica of what life is _ up and down. It's been going up and
down since they invented it. It goes down, then something gives it
a boost and it comes up. It's not going to fade away. But right now
it definitely needs something.''
</P>
<P>
   He was in the final stages of preparation for his rematch with
Lennox Lewis in Las Vegas Saturday night, a contest intended to
produce an undisputed heavyweight champion of the world.
</P>
<P>
   And the one thing that the two fighters agreed on during this
week's pre-fight publicity blitz was that sport itself is in
serious danger of ending the century on the canvas.
</P>
<P>
   As the hour draws near, Holyfield-Lewis II has come to seem less
of a mere title decider than boxing's last best hope for
redemption.
</P>
<P>
   As Holyfield implied, prizefighting has never been without its
shadows. But this year has been spent in a gathering gloom,
starting with the attempt by Mike Tyson to break Axel Schulz's arm
in a clinch last January and running all the way through to the
ludicrous finish of Tyson's most recent encounter, when he was
disqualified for hitting Orlin Norris after the bell ended the
first round.
</P>
<P>
   In between came the fiasco of the first Holyfield-Lewis fight,
in March, when a poor contest ended in a controversial draw.
</P>
<P>
   That was followed by the much anticipated but similarly
disappointing world welterweight championship fight between Oscar
De La Hoya and Felix Trinidad, when De La Hoya tried to win the
fight in reverse gear.
</P>
<P>
   And then, last month, came Naseem Hamed's unseemly display of
body-slamming against Cesar Soto in a fight more suited to a WWF
bill.
</P>
<P>
   When they pay their money, boxing fans know that they lay
themselves open to the risk of sudden and sometimes mystifying
disappointment. Such sensations go back to Sonny Liston quitting on
his stool against Cassius Clay, and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   By the nature of the sport, nothing can be guaranteed. But this
year's procession of embarrassments resembles a systematic cheating
of the public, and the public has begun to show its resentment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year's fights have left the fans in a very bad state of
mind,'' Emanuel Steward, Lewis's highly respected trainer, said
Thursday. ``They have a lot of questions. Right now they're on the
brink of deserting boxing, and I understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   The fans would not have been reassured by the last week's news
of the criminal indictments naming the IBF president, Bob Lee, and
three other officials, who are accused by the U.S. Attorney and the
FBI of taking bribes to rig the rankings in order to produce the
match-ups desired by certain top promoters over a 13-year period.
</P>
<P>
   This week a New York State Senate committee recommended the
creation of a national body to regulate the sport and prevent it,
in the words of its chairman, Senator Roy Goodman, from
``degenerating into a meaningless and violent show.''
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously the Attorney General of Nevada, Frankie Sue Del
Papa, announced that her office will be working with the state's
Athletic Commission, the sanctioning body for Saturday's fight, on
an investigation into the way the sport is organized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say what it is that's wrong,'' Holyfield said in his
last pre-fight interview, knowing that the Miami offices of his
promoter, Don King, had been searched as part of the FBI
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It involves a lot of different components. People should come
together and decide what's best for the sport. The boxers, the TV
people, the managers, the promoters, the writers. It needs a
collective effort to make it a better sport for everybody,
including the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   In Lennox Lewis's view, the unification of the three
championships _ Holyfield's World Boxing Association and
International Boxing Federation belts and his own World Boxing
Council title _ would be a first step, providing a single
figurehead behind which the sport could regroup and reunite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of the governing bodies has its own agenda,'' he said.
``The sport needs to be cleaned up so that it's not as dodgy as it
is now. My hope is to be a good ambassador for boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   But a good ambassador would not produce, by himself, the sort of
root-and-branch reform that boxing needs.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will one great fight be enough to refurbish boxing's image.
``But at least it would give a little hope,'' Manny Steward said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between the bad decision over the Lewis fight, and the De La
Hoya-Trinidad fight not being a damn thing but a foot race, and
then to come back with Tyson, people feel they've been wasting
their money. So this fight really could help push them one way or
another.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 800 IF NEEDED, OR CONTINUE TO 925) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   The sport's image needs Holyfield and Lewis to produce a contest
worthy of inclusion in the all-time highlights reel. When Marc
Ratner, the serious-minded head of the Nevada Athletic Commission,
called it ``a pivotal fight for boxing as we head into the new
millennium'' at Wednesday's press conference, he was not merely
indulging in the usual hyperbole.
</P>
<P>
   Both fighters are clearly aware of their wider responsibility,
and have the capacity to produce the goods.
</P>
<P>
   But if they find, when they are alone together in the ring, that
self-interest once more overcomes the urge to create a spectacle,
then the arena's cleaning staff can sweep up what remains of the
sport's integrity and throw it out along with the rest of the
trash. &QL;

UCLA NEEDS TO IMPRESS RECRUITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's a big game for UCLA _ not just because of the
opponent (first-place Washington), but also because of the
spectators. This is one of the Bruins' biggest recruiting weekends
of the season, with four coveted national prospects visiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a bunch of recruits from out of state,'' Bruins coach
Bob Toledo said, ``and it's important to put on a good show for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   They are:
</P>
<P>
   _Stevie Lee, one of the nation's top defensive tackles. He's
from Evangel Christian Academy in Shreveport, La., and he has
Michigan, Florida State, Texas and Texas A&AMP;M on his list.
</P>
<P>
   _Phillip Geiggar, a safety from Evangel Christian who's
considering Florida State, Florida and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   _Ronnie Rodamer, a 6-foot-4 receiver from Morgantown, W.Va., who
has scholarship offers from Tennessee and Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   _Albert Hollis, a tailback from Sacramento who orally committed
to UCLA months ago but is visiting other schools.
</P>
<P>
   Valencia linebacker Ray Cassaday, who has committed to UCLA, and
tailback Manuel White, who has not, also are visiting this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Pep gathering: Thursday's practice was interrupted for 10
minutes when hundreds of UCLA athletes and athletic-department
employees trotted onto Spaulding Field to inspire the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   A local Pop Warner team dressed in UCLA jerseys also attended
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking for some substitutes,'' Toledo quipped. ``They're
a little skinny, but they're hard to tackle.''
</P>
<P>
   Review of the Week: Defensive tackle Pete Holland, a history
major and six-time member of the director's honor roll, has agreed
to review a book each week for the Daily News. This week: (ital)The
Lords of Discipline, by Pat Conroy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conroy, the most poetic and contemporary storyteller of the
South, tells the tale of a young group of men struggling for
survival and striving for manhood in The Citadel, the brutal South
Carolina military institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through carefully and artfully wrought characters, Conroy
weaves a poignant tale of how ambition and prejudice challenge
everything these young men think they know about loyalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Rating: 3 sacks (out of four).
</P>
<P>
   Big Kick: Gastin Kutos, winner of the Daily News/KCAL 9 Kick For
Cash promotion, could score a grand prize of $100,000 if he makes a
35-yard field goal at the end of the first quarter Saturday. Kutos,
22, from Los Angeles, reached the finals by kicking the longest
field goal in the qualifying round.
</P>
<P>
   If Kutos misses, he'll receive two tickets to the Jan. 1 Rose
Bowl, plus UCLA season tickets for next season.

DEATHS OF BROTHERS PROMPTS HOT-LINE INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DONNA McGUIRE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ State Auditor Claire McCaskill expects to
spend as long as six months conducting the first statewide probe
into how Missouri workers respond to hot-line calls on child abuse
and neglect.
</P>
<P>
   McCaskill pledged to conduct a performance review of the
Division of Family Services hot-line system during her campaign for
auditor more than a year ago. The deaths of 8-year-old brothers
Larry and Gary Bass last month in Kansas City prompted her to begin
the audit earlier than she had planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided I couldn't wait any longer,'' McCaskill, the former
Jackson County prosecutor, said during a press conference Thursday
at Kansas City Police Department headquarters. ``It is pretty
important that somebody answers the bell when people call (the hot
line).''
</P>
<P>
   An internal DFS investigation recently found that a hot-line
worker and other staff made errors in the Bass case after a
hot-line call was received this fall. DFS suspended at least three
employees for 20 days, expanded employee training and hired an
outside expert to study the agency's child-welfare training
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The boys' mother, Mary Bass, 31, faces child-abuse charges and
two counts of second-degree murder. Child-abuse charges also were
filed against her boyfriend, Tony Dixon, 36.
</P>
<P>
   A four- or five-member team from the state auditor's office will
spend a few weeks learning DFS hot-line guidelines and training
procedures before studying how well the agency meets its own
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Agency officials pledged to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have talked all week about the necessity to look at
ourselves and improve procedures to protect children,'' said Deb
Hendricks, a spokeswoman for the Missouri Department of Social
Services, which oversees DFS. ``This is certainly another piece of
information to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The auditor's probe will not attempt to study individual cases
or judge any DFS child-protection decisions, McCaskill said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not Monday-morning quarterbacking,'' she said.
``Rather, it is about the process of the hot line and whether or
not we have consistency and whether (DFS) processes are being
followed.''
</P>
<P>
   All calls to Missouri's child abuse hot line, (800) 392-3738,
are routed to Jefferson City. Reports generated by those calls are
electronically forwarded to individual DFS offices. In Jackson
County, for example, a bell rings when a report arrives on a
printer. After hours, an on-call staff member receives a page.
</P>
<P>
   Calls are coded as emergency or nonemergency. On emergency
calls, an investigator is sent as soon as possible. Nonemergency
calls are to be handled within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   After making contact, the investigator logs information about
that contact into the DFS system. A supervisor reviews that
information.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Jefferson City track response times statewide each
month.

   On average in Jackson County, DFS receives about 600 reports of
child abuse and neglect per month. Most investigations are
concluded within 30 days, and some are concluded much more quickly.
In the majority of cases _ 75 to 80 percent of the time _ the state
decides it lacks ``probable cause'' to show that abuse or neglect
occurred.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ ``Boxing,'' Evander Holyfield mused this week, ``is
a replica of what life is _ up and down. It's been going up and
down since they invented it. It goes down, then something gives it
a boost and it comes up. It's not going to fade away. But right now
it definitely needs something.''
</P>
<P>
   He was in the final stages of preparation for his rematch with
Lennox Lewis in Las Vegas Saturday night, a contest intended to
produce an undisputed heavyweight champion of the world.
</P>
<P>
   And the one thing that the two fighters agreed on during this
week's pre-fight publicity blitz was that sport itself is in
serious danger of ending the century on the canvas.
</P>
<P>
   As the hour draws near, Holyfield-Lewis II has come to seem less
of a mere title decider than boxing's last best hope for
redemption.
</P>
<P>
   As Holyfield implied, prizefighting has never been without its
shadows. But this year has been spent in a gathering gloom,
starting with the attempt by Mike Tyson to break Axel Schulz's arm
in a clinch last January and running all the way through to the
ludicrous finish of Tyson's most recent encounter, when he was
disqualified for hitting Orlin Norris after the bell ended the
first round.
</P>
<P>
   In between came the fiasco of the first Holyfield-Lewis fight,
in March, when a poor contest ended in a controversial draw.
</P>
<P>
   That was followed by the much anticipated but similarly
disappointing world welterweight championship fight between Oscar
De La Hoya and Felix Trinidad, when De La Hoya tried to win the
fight in reverse gear.
</P>
<P>
   And then, last month, came Naseem Hamed's unseemly display of
body-slamming against Cesar Soto in a fight more suited to a WWF
bill.
</P>
<P>
   When they pay their money, boxing fans know that they lay
themselves open to the risk of sudden and sometimes mystifying
disappointment. Such sensations go back to Sonny Liston quitting on
his stool against Cassius Clay, and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   By the nature of the sport, nothing can be guaranteed. But this
year's procession of embarrassments resembles a systematic cheating
of the public, and the public has begun to show its resentment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year's fights have left the fans in a very bad state of
mind,'' Emanuel Steward, Lewis's highly respected trainer, said
Thursday. ``They have a lot of questions. Right now they're on the
brink of deserting boxing, and I understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   The fans would not have been reassured by the last week's news
of the criminal indictments naming the IBF president, Bob Lee, and
three other officials, who are accused by the U.S. Attorney and the
FBI of taking bribes to rig the rankings in order to produce the
match-ups desired by certain top promoters over a 13-year period.
</P>
<P>
   This week a New York State Senate committee recommended the
creation of a national body to regulate the sport and prevent it,
in the words of its chairman, Senator Roy Goodman, from
``degenerating into a meaningless and violent show.''
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously the Attorney General of Nevada, Frankie Sue Del
Papa, announced that her office will be working with the state's
Athletic Commission, the sanctioning body for Saturday's fight, on
an investigation into the way the sport is organized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say what it is that's wrong,'' Holyfield said in his
last pre-fight interview, knowing that the Miami offices of his
promoter, Don King, had been searched as part of the FBI
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It involves a lot of different components. People should come
together and decide what's best for the sport. The boxers, the TV
people, the managers, the promoters, the writers. It needs a
collective effort to make it a better sport for everybody,
including the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   In Lennox Lewis's view, the unification of the three
championships _ Holyfield's World Boxing Association and
International Boxing Federation belts and his own World Boxing
Council title _ would be a first step, providing a single
figurehead behind which the sport could regroup and reunite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of the governing bodies has its own agenda,'' he said.
``The sport needs to be cleaned up so that it's not as dodgy as it
is now. My hope is to be a good ambassador for boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   But a good ambassador would not produce, by himself, the sort of
root-and-branch reform that boxing needs.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will one great fight be enough to refurbish boxing's image.
``But at least it would give a little hope,'' Manny Steward said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between the bad decision over the Lewis fight, and the De La
Hoya-Trinidad fight not being a damn thing but a foot race, and
then to come back with Tyson, people feel they've been wasting
their money. So this fight really could help push them one way or
another.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 800 IF NEEDED, OR CONTINUE TO 925) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   The sport's image needs Holyfield and Lewis to produce a contest
worthy of inclusion in the all-time highlights reel. When Marc
Ratner, the serious-minded head of the Nevada Athletic Commission,
called it ``a pivotal fight for boxing as we head into the new
millennium'' at Wednesday's press conference, he was not merely
indulging in the usual hyperbole.
</P>
<P>
   Both fighters are clearly aware of their wider responsibility,
and have the capacity to produce the goods.
</P>
<P>
   But if they find, when they are alone together in the ring, that
self-interest once more overcomes the urge to create a spectacle,
then the arena's cleaning staff can sweep up what remains of the
sport's integrity and throw it out along with the rest of the
trash. &QL;

DECORATED HORSE STALLS AT AMERICAN ROYAL EARN PRAISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY BERRIOS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Juel Carman might be the Martha Stewart of
horse shows. But he wrinkles his nose at that description.
</P>
<P>
   Carman, after all, is a hired gun _ staple gun that is.
</P>
<P>
   Carman, 64, decorates stalls at about 20 horse shows across the
country. This week he brought his talent with bolts of cheesecloth
to the American Royal. Carman has decorated horse stalls at the
American Royal for about 33 years.
</P>
<P>
   By last Tuesday afternoon, Carman and his five-man crew had
decorated 300 stalls in three days. They used 100,000 staples and
between 4,000 and 5,000 yards of cheesecloth _ imagine about two to
three miles of cloth.
</P>
<P>
   Owners tell Carman what colors to use, usually the farm or
stable's colors, and what kind of design they want.
</P>
<P>
   Carter Cox, the owner of Woodstock Farm in Danville, Ky., said
Carman has decorated his stalls at the American Royal for about 16
years. Cox said presentation is important.
</P>
<P>
   Cox said he will spend between $1,500 and $2,000 on the 10
stalls Carman decorated this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are going to sell a Mercedes there has to be a certain
imagery to it,'' Cox said. ``I think Juel helps project that.''
</P>
<P>
   Carman weaves his magic with his trusty staple gun and colorful
cloth. A gray rosette here. A red, gray and black sunburst there.
Or maybe a simple front of blue and gray.
</P>
<P>
   He decorates horse stalls, tack rooms, sitting rooms and stall
fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Carman started in the decorating business with his father-in-law
in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Horse show veterans say Carman has cornered the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juel pretty well has a monopoly,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   But Carman insists, ``It's open to anyone who wants to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Stewart needs a challenge.

SMALL VIEWERS MAKE HIT OUT OF `POKEMON'

<P>
   Pokemania has struck America's multiplexes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pokemon: the First Movie'' generated a better-than-expected
$10.1 million on opening day Wednesday at 2,889 theaters as
exhibitors reported numerous sellouts. Warner Bros. predicted the
Thursday total would match that number.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pokemon'' posted the fourth-biggest Wednesday opening ever,
trailing ``Star Wars: Episode 1'' ($28.5 million), ``Independence
Day'' ($17.4 million) and ``Men In Black'' ($14 million). The
number was impressive since most tickets were sold at discounted
children's and matinee rates.
</P>
<P>
   The studio also predicted the movie will break the $45.7million
record set by ``A Bug's Life'' for best five-day opening by an
animated film.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations, credited
Warner Bros. with exploiting the children's fad of collecting
Pokemon cards and toys. Warner planned to give away 8 million cards
_ one for each ticket _ and reported Thursday some theaters had run
out of their allocation.
</P>
<P>
   Warner also will distribute 2 million cards at its Studio
Stores; Burger King has launched a tie-in promotion giving away 57
Pokemon toys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie has been part of a brilliant marketing scheme,''
Dergarabedian said. ``They've also released it at exactly the right
time. It's imperative to release this kind of film when it's hot
because kids can change their minds quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Dergarabedian said the film should perform well through the
holiday season even after Disney's ``Toy Story 2'' opens Nov. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Warner distribution chief Dan Fellman said the opening was far
above studio forecasts, adding, ``We've had exhibitors calling all
day to say it's a great way to launch the holiday season.''
</P>
<P>
   Fellman said the studio plans to extend the card giveaway by up
to 10 million more cards.

PEARLS STOLEN BY JEWELRY RING, POLICE SAY
</HEADLINE>
  
( Eds, corrects time element in lede sentence to Wednesday night.) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<P>
   Police believe that a band of gun-toting Colombian jewelry
thieves hit the Los Angeles region again Wednesday night, robbing a
man of $600,000 in pearl necklaces on a freeway transition road in
South Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The heist is the latest in a string of holdups around Los
Angeles and the San Fernando Valley, netting about $500 million
annually, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having a lot of these robberies,'' said Los Angeles
Detective Michael Woodings, part of a 15-member jewelry heist task
force. ``We've got some good information regarding some aspects of
who the suspects are, but all we know is we've got violent
criminals who are good at what they do.''
</P>
<P>
   The thieves tail jewelers from areas such as the Los Angeles
Jewelry Mart to the jewelers' homes. They also have been known to
disable the victim's car by slashing a tire or ripping out a
radiator hose.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest heist at 8 p.m. Thursday, a jewelry salesman had
hailed a cab downtown and was en route to Los Angeles International
Airport to catch a flight to New York. Four gunmen in a
dark-colored Chevrolet Blazer boxed in the taxi on the transition
from the southbound Harbor Freeway to the eastbound Glenn Anderson
Freeway.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen, including one wearing a dark-colored ski mask and a
hood, approached the cab, took the keys, opened the trunk and
grabbed two suitcases containing pearl necklaces valued at
$600,000. The robbers then fled.
</P>
<P>
   Police have recorded more than six such incidents in the Valley
so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   In February, gunmen carjacked a jewelry courier at his home in
Woodland Hills and stole $100,000 in goods. In March, thieves
confronted a courier at his home in Encino and stole an undisclosed
amount of goods. In April, a crook carrying a shotgun stole
$300,000 in jewelry from a courier in Chatsworth.
</P>
<P>
   That same month in Thousand Oaks, a gunman forced a courier into
his trunk and stole $500,000 worth of jewelry. On April 26, robbers
were foiled in Van Nuys when they took an empty jewelry case from a
courier who had dropped off his goods for the day. Later that
month, a gunman took $20,000 in gold and jewelry from a courier in
Reseda.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities believe that a network of about 200 thieves they
describe as Colombians who live in Los Angeles make their living by
selling stolen items to a single person, earning about 25 cents on
the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Because the group consists of many leaders and is egalitarian in
its operations, all participants in a robbery receive equal pay for
equal work, police said.
</P>
<P>
   They are so sophisticated, police say, that some of their
surveillance and countersurveillance capabilities make it difficult
for police to catch them.
</P>
<P>
   One theory is that the gang prefers to recruit former Colombian
police and soldiers because they typically are disciplined and
steer clear of drugs and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're working for a bigger network,'' said Moshe Pereg,
president of the Jewelry Manufacturers Guild in Los Angeles.
``Organized crime in Colombia is very developed.''

   CHICAGO _ The cows are everywhere in the Chicago Theatre,
standing around the elegant marble lobby, scattered about the
balconies and queuing up along the carpeted corridors. There are
one or two outside in the street, waiting to be brought inside, and
there are quite a few in the showroom next door.
</P>
<P>
   These are the most famous, well loved and certainly the best
behaved cows that the city of Chicago has ever known, which has a
lot to do with the fact that they are made of fiberglass.
</P>
<P>
   For months over 300 of them stood around the center of the city,
as ornaments, contemporary art and just plain fun, delighting the
residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that can take my teenager downtown four times must be
good,'' says Dave Durham, a local journalist, as he prepared for
the charity auction Tuesday night that was to sell them off for
good.
</P>
<P>
   They are pure fantasy and imagination, some in pop art or
psychedelic colors, a Mondrian, Magritte and Miro, one in red
mirror tiles, and another covered entirely with bottle tops.
</P>
<P>
   There are cows done up as grandes dames with dresses and pearls,
a space cow in full NASA kit (called ``Mooooooonwalk''), Yankee
Doodle Cow, one with a shark's fin, and (my personal favorite) a
carmine red cow suspended upside down and entitled Odalisque
(Reclining Nude).
</P>
<P>
   There is one still on display in the United Airlines office,
which is a bovine member of the Coldstream Guards, complete with
bearskin and chin strap, but all the rest have been corralled here

</P>
<P>
   For many years, Chicago was a little wary of being called
Cowtown. The city has long thought of itself as a sophisticated,
international metropolis, not a center for cattle auctions any
more.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that today Chicago is a sophisticated international
metropolis, utterly confident of itself, the center of the city
revived by a booming economy, a smart mayor and a lot of hard work.
It can afford to laugh at itself a little.
</P>
<P>
   It made its fortune through its vast stockyards, abbatoirs and
meat packing plants and agriculture is still very important to the
local economy: farm machinery makers John Deere and Caterpillar and
agribusiness giants like Archer Daniels Midland are locals, and
much of Illinois is still farming country.
</P>
<P>
   But the giant Chicago exchanges are more likely to be trading
financial futures than longhorns these days, and many of those
giant buildings sprouting out in the fields are distribution
centers for electronic commerce companies.
</P>
<P>
   Chicagoans still have a love affair with the cow in another
form, suitably aged, perfectly grilled and plonked on to a plate
with some of Idaho's finest potatoes and a little freshly made
English mustard.
</P>
<P>
   Only in Buenos Aires and Kobe in Japan will you find a similar
fixation on steak. At Gibsons, one of the finest steak houses in
the world, they will lovingly show you the cuts before you order,
indicating the finer points of the marbling and the texture.
</P>
<P>
   There is everything from a dainty little 22-ounce rib eye to the
life-threatening 48-ounce Porterhouse, which presumably requires
health insurance (they sell three or four a night).
</P>
<P>
   Preceded by a vase full of gin martini, accompanied by a bottle
of hefty cabernet sauvignon and followed by a cigar in the bar
afterwards, this is a truly Chicagoan meal, one that leaves you
with great respect for these tough, gritty Midwesterners and their
tough, gritty digestive systems.
</P>
<P>
   But there is rather more to Chicago food than steak these days,
just as there is more to Chicago than cows. The new restaurants
which are springing up around town are as likely to serve bean
sprouts as beef.
</P>
<P>
   Blackbird has milk-soaked and rock-salt-cured foie gras with
quince puree; Tru offers roasted sturgeon over braised oxtail and
truffle ragout. The challenge to the digestion is just as robust
and the cholesterol count remains impressive, of course; this is
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The cows _ frivolous, wild, wacky or endearing _ have helped
Chicago crystallize a sense of itself as a city on the up.
</P>
<P>
   It was a very typical gesture from Mayor Richard Daley, who is
sometimes mocked as ``Mayor of the Flowerpots'' for his obsessive
interest in the details of city management, but he also understands
intuitively what works and what makes people happy. Getting the
details right, and doing it in a spirit of fun, are critical to a
city's sense of itself.
</P>
<P>
   There was an additional perk from the cows, which is that they
helped Chicago get one up on New York.
</P>
<P>
   As they were on display in Chicago, New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani hit the headlines for trying to close down the
``Sensations'' exhibition of contemporary art in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Daley is positively upbeat, Mayor Giuliani comes across
as a mean man,'' wrote Thomas Cochran, Executive Director of the
U.S. Conference of Mayors. ``It is interesting how art affects two
cities and how two mayors use art _ one in a very positive way and
the other negative _ to convey different messages.''
</P>
<P>
   For a city with a robust sense of civic pride, it was mooooosic
to their ears. &QL;

VETERAN RECEIVES REPLACEMENT PURPLE HEART IN CEREMONY AT GRADE
SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATT STEARNS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HIGHLANDVILLE, Mo. _ Like countless others, Ralph P. Francisco
Jr. served.
</P>
<P>
   For him, it was in Gen. George S. Patton's 3rd Army, as it
slogged slowly through Europe to Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco vividly remembers the day his war ended; the day a
shell fragment tore through his leg in a snowy field in February
1945. He received a Purple Heart for having been wounded in combat.
</P>
<P>
   Like countless others, Francisco went home, put his medal in a
cedar chest and got on with his life. Never thought much about it,
other than the satisfaction of knowing it was there.
</P>
<P>
   Until the day, 14 years ago, when it wasn't. When Francisco
realized someone had stolen the Purple Heart from his home in the
small southwest Missouri town of Forsyth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ralph's not much to say anything,'' said his wife, Allene
Francisco. ``It made him sick. Who would do that?''
</P>
<P>
   Veterans Days, when folks would ask about it, were especially
hard, Ralph Francisco said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, thanks to the interest of a third-grade teacher in
the Ozarks, the dogged efforts of a Pentagon employee who knew her,
and the military code of honoring those who came before, the town
of Highlandville gave Francisco, 73, a Veterans Day to remember.
</P>
<P>
   There, in a linoleum-tiled school gymnasium, underneath a set of
smudged glass basketball backboards, before several dozen rapt
students, friends and relatives, Ralph Francisco got a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   He got a new Purple Heart.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for replacing Francisco's medal came up about two weeks
ago in a conversation between Stephani Bryant, a third-grade
teacher at Highlandville Elementary School, and Jo Higgins, the
school's gym teacher and Francisco's daughter. Higgins told Bryant
of her father's loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to get him a new one,'' Higgins said. ``I
didn't know if it was possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, who had taught a special section on veterans to her
class and had invited several veterans to speak for Veterans Day,
decided to see whether she could get Francisco a replacement medal
in time for the holiday. She called Steve Doucette, a college
friend who is a civilian employee at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, they ran into a problem. The military has a backlog
of about 98,000 requests for replacement medals _ about two years'
worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paperwork at the Pentagon is a nightmare,'' Doucette said.
``Going through the official chain would have taken months.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Francisco's discharge papers would have allowed them to
bypass the lengthy procedure. But he had given them to his mother,
who had since died. Francisco, who settled down on a Forsyth farm,
raised three children, ran a service station and sold insurance,
hadn't given much thought to them. Nobody knew where the papers
were.
</P>
<P>
   But when Higgins asked her father whether he had any other
documentation, he pulled out his wallet and withdrew a tattered old
card he had been carrying around for 53 years: a portable copy of
his discharge papers. Under a category for citations, it read,
``Purple Heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant and Higgins sent a copy of the card to Doucette, still
keeping the quest a secret from Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just thought my class was really into it and that's why we
were asking him all this,'' Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   It was enough to get the medal, which Doucette's co-workers
chipped in to pay for. But just getting the medal wasn't enough for
Doucette.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking, `We've got to do more than just send down the
medal,' '' said Doucette, a senior intelligence specialist for the
Air Force. ``What a great opportunity for this guy. It just made me
feel like we've got to do more. The military is a big family, and
it's nice to have an opportunity to thank him.''
</P>
<P>
   So Doucette, through his military contacts, arranged for an
autographed picture to Francisco from Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He arranged for Lt. Col. Gus
Stafford, a battalion commander from Fort Leonard Wood, to present
the medal in the ceremony at the school gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 23,000 people that work here,'' Doucette said of the
Pentagon. ``Getting things through is just impossible. I think
everyone knew this little school was the catalyst.''
</P>
<P>
   And just two weeks after the initial conversation, Stafford
pinned the Purple Heart to the left breast pocket of Francisco's
green-and-white plaid shirt as sunlight poured in through the
gymnasium's open doors.
</P>
<P>
   Stafford, a strapping Ranger with a dazzling set of medals and
ribbons on his own uniform, choked up a bit as he presented the
medal to the aging veteran, who stood straight, but whose slack jaw
gave away his shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rare to give a Purple Heart in the first place,''
Stafford said afterward. ``To be able to put a Purple Heart on a
World War II veteran is just an unimaginable honor for me. I use
the movie `Saving Private Ryan' in basic training to teach the
whole idea of duty, of fulfilling your obligations. This is the
Army living up to its values.''
</P>
<P>
   And in era when the military seems fairly distant from many
people's lives, Stafford said, the ceremony also served the
military's purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really important to reach out to American society,
especially in small towns like this,'' he said. ``To make sure they
don't forget us and to show we don't forget them.''
</P>
<P>
   The message, taught by Bryant and symbolized by Francisco and
Stafford, seemed to get across to the children in the town of about
700.
</P>
<P>
   ``Veterans are important, because they keep us safe, they fight
for our freedom....That way, other countries can't steal our
freedom,'' wrote Brian Campbell, 9, in an essay he read aloud at a
classroom reception after the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Even Francisco said he learned something from the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really something,'' Francisco said. ``It means a lot more
to me now after this. It was just something I had before. I'll put
it back in a box, but I'll keep a close watch on it. I'll wear it
on Veterans Day, and maybe some days when it's not Veterans Day.''

   CHICAGO _ The cows are everywhere in the Chicago Theatre,
standing around the elegant marble lobby, scattered about the
balconies and queuing up along the carpeted corridors. There are
one or two outside in the street, waiting to be brought inside, and
there are quite a few in the showroom next door.
</P>
<P>
   These are the most famous, well loved and certainly the best
behaved cows that the city of Chicago has ever known, which has a
lot to do with the fact that they are made of fiberglass.
</P>
<P>
   For months over 300 of them stood around the center of the city,
as ornaments, contemporary art and just plain fun, delighting the
residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that can take my teenager downtown four times must be
good,'' says Dave Durham, a local journalist, as he prepared for
the charity auction Tuesday night that was to sell them off for
good.
</P>
<P>
   They are pure fantasy and imagination, some in pop art or
psychedelic colors, a Mondrian, Magritte and Miro, one in red
mirror tiles, and another covered entirely with bottle tops.
</P>
<P>
   There are cows done up as grandes dames with dresses and pearls,
a space cow in full NASA kit (called ``Mooooooonwalk''), Yankee
Doodle Cow, one with a shark's fin, and (my personal favorite) a
carmine red cow suspended upside down and entitled Odalisque
(Reclining Nude).
</P>
<P>
   There is one still on display in the United Airlines office,
which is a bovine member of the Coldstream Guards, complete with
bearskin and chin strap, but all the rest have been corralled here
into the theatre.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, Chicago was a little wary of being called
Cowtown. The city has long thought of itself as a sophisticated,
international metropolis, not a center for cattle auctions any

</P>

   The truth is that today Chicago is a sophisticated international
metropolis, utterly confident of itself, the center of the city
revived by a booming economy, a smart mayor and a lot of hard work.
It can afford to laugh at itself a little.
</P>
<P>
   It made its fortune through its vast stockyards, abbatoirs and
meat packing plants and agriculture is still very important to the
local economy: farm machinery makers John Deere and Caterpillar and
agribusiness giants like Archer Daniels Midland are locals, and
much of Illinois is still farming country.
</P>
<P>
   But the giant Chicago exchanges are more likely to be trading
financial futures than longhorns these days, and many of those
giant buildings sprouting out in the fields are distribution
centers for electronic commerce companies.
</P>
<P>
   Chicagoans still have a love affair with the cow in another
form, suitably aged, perfectly grilled and plonked on to a plate
with some of Idaho's finest potatoes and a little freshly made
English mustard.
</P>
<P>
   Only in Buenos Aires and Kobe in Japan will you find a similar
fixation on steak. At Gibsons, one of the finest steak houses in
the world, they will lovingly show you the cuts before you order,
indicating the finer points of the marbling and the texture.

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Before a hushed crowd at the Liberty Memorial
on Thursday, retired Adm. Robert Spane told tales of the Navy
bombers who won the Battle of Midway and helped change the course
of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   He heralded the bombers as ``common Americans who did uncommon
things.''
</P>
<P>
   On a crisp morning, city leaders also used the Veterans Day
service as a chance to honor the unsung heroes of Kansas City:
ordinary people who helped save the Liberty Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, the city will begin a $65 million restoration of the
monument, which has been closed since 1994 because of unsafe
conditions. Leaders praised voters who last year backed a sales tax
to finance improvements.
</P>
<P>
   The monument is to reopen on Veterans Day 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, I believe it is fitting that on such a beautiful day,
the cloud over the Liberty Memorial is lifting,'' said Sheila
Kemper Dietrich, co-chairwoman for the Kids for Liberty campaign.
``And many of you here are the reasons why we're here today.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as they looked with hope toward the monument's future,
almost 1,000 dignitaries, veterans and other people remembered the
sacrifices of the past. Spane, who is chief executive officer of
Vanguard Airlines, gave the keynote address.
</P>
<P>
   As with every Veterans Day service, this year's gathering
honored the thread that binds veterans of all generations.
</P>
<P>
   The Sons of the Revolution, dressed in uniforms of the 1700s,
recalled those who fought for America's independence.
</P>
<P>
   They marched with high school ROTC students walking lockstep on
the circular drive in front of the memorial. Drums tapped. Shoes
clacked. Veterans from the Vietnam and Korean wars clustered with
their compatriots.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial was one of the last Kansas City landmarks Robert
Chappell saw before he boarded a train at Union Station on his way
to fight in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   After being captured at the Battle of the Bulge, Chappell said,
he spent five months in a German prisoner-of-war camp. His captors
sent him on forced marches. A small chunk of bread lasted a week.
He lost 80 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to Kansas City, the 217-foot-monument high on
the hill nearly brought tears to his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like heaven to me,'' recalled Chappell, 75, as he
adjusted his hearing aid and gazed up at the deteriorating
structure again Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The restoration will fortify the structural support system under
the courtyard, replace the elevated decks and stairways, and
restore or replace the fountains, urns and sphinxes. The city also
will restore Memory Hall, the administration building, the tower
and the grounds adjacent to the memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters still need more private donations for an expanded
museum at the monument's base.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still need another $18 million to make sure that we have
exhibits you can see when the doors open,'' said Ollie Gates,
chairman of the Citizens to Save Liberty Memorial Campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did a great job across the street,'' Gates noted,
referring to Union Station. ``But we can do even better.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City Mayor Kay Barnes called the day a significant one in
the city's history. As Barnes attended the reopening of Union
Station on Wednesday, she said Liberty Memorial was in her
thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``My vantage point looked up to the memorial,'' Barnes said.
``There are significant improvements under way in these two blocks.
And we have an obligation to bring this memorial back so we can
continue to be able to commemorate all veterans.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur S. Brisbane, president and publisher of The Kansas City
Star, said it was important for children to learn from the ``wisdom
of past generations.'' The newspaper helped sponsor the Kids for
Liberty campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Some youngsters appeared to be getting the message.
</P>
<P>
   Katie Jo Baumgardner, 11, of Clear Creek Elementary School in
Shawnee, Kan., read a winning essay about the importance of
citizenship. Her school raised $1,056 for the Kids for Liberty
campaign, a citywide effort to involve schoolchildren in the fund
raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``My essay was about serving the needs of others,'' Katie Jo
said. ``And as the city gets larger, so do its needs. By learning
to serve, we will become good citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   David Valdivia, 10, roamed the grounds holding a sign with a
picture of his late grandfather, who served in World War II. Daniel
Barrera died in 1986, before David was born. The sign was meant to
honor Barrera and all other veterans.
</P>
<P>
   As a high school band played taps to end the ceremony, David ran
across the driveway for a better look.
</P>
<P>
   He said he'd love to follow his grandfather into the Army.
Although he'd never visited the Liberty Memorial, David said he
recognized the sacrifices of those who served their country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of them, because their job is important,'' David
said.
</P>
<P>
   Said his mother, Carmela Valdivia: ``He's learning a lot
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Anita Gorman, a former member of the Kansas City Board of Parks
and Recreation Commissioners, said she was proud that the city was
remembering veterans and reclaiming the memorial that honored them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows that Kansas Citians don't forget,'' Gorman said.
``And promises we make, we keep.''

<P>
   Two American companies have separately devised ways to make hens
produce useful pharmaceutical chemicals in their eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Once distilled from the genetically modified egg whites, the
proteins could be used for straightforward medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   GeneWorks, in Ann Arbor, Mich., already has a flock of between
50 and 60 GM chickens, ``New Scientist'' magazine reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the fowl have a gene that makes them secrete a human
growth factor in the whites of their eggs; others produce a human
antibody for fighting infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
   AviGenics, of Athens, Ga., says that it has GM cocks siring
chicks that produce human interferon, which fights cancer, in their
eggs.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for both companies is huge. Each egg contains
about 100mg of the human protein, and a normal hen can produce 200
eggs a year. Multiplied across a flock, GM technology could produce
huge ``pharms'' in which chickens are a principal source of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, though, the hope of a GM egg breakfast to cure your ills
is unfounded: cooking would literally scramble the amino acids that
make up the drugs, rendering them useless. And eating the eggs raw
would not guarantee the dose received.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at PPL Therapeutics, the company that has a flock of
GM sheep whose milk contains a drug to treat cystic fibrosis,
predicted that it could take at least five years for the drugs from
the GM chickens to reach patients.
</P>
<P>
   And other scientists expressed disappointment that the
technology used to produce the GM eggs had not been published in
scientific literature so that other researchers could examine it
for flaws. &QL;

GALAXY REACHES MLS FINAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<P>
   PASADENA _ Rarely seen team president Tim Leiweke visited the
Galaxy locker room before Thursday's decisive match with Dallas. He
said he saw a bunch of focused faces and admitted his presence may
have spoiled the mood.
</P>
<P>
   A problem with preparation was one reason why Leiweke fired
coach Octavio Zambrano in March and replaced him with longtime UCLA
coach Sigi Schmid.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Leiweke's paying Schmid, he certainly got his money's
worth.
</P>
<P>
   In a near-flawless performance from start to finish, the
emotionally-charged Galaxy delivered quick blows, then kept the
Burn on its heels, not allowing the pesky group from Dallas to ever
find a rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   Once Galaxy playmaker Mauricio Cienfuegos delivered the biggest
blow in the 68th minute, L.A. knew it was on its way to the Nov. 21
MLS Cup championship in Foxboro, Mass., eliminating the Burn 3-1 in
front of 25,703 at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Cienfuegos, Carlos Hermosillo and Greg Vanney all scored to give
the Galaxy its second Western Conference title in four years,
returning the team to the place where it suffered the toughest loss
in franchise history, a 3-2 defeat to D.C. United in the inaugural
1996 MLS championship.
</P>
<P>
   Now all L.A. has to do is await the winner of Saturday's
decisive match between Columbus and D.C. United to learn who stands
in the way.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy didn't waste any time testing Dallas' thin backline _
which was without starters Eric Dade and Brandon Pollard.
</P>
<P>
   Vanney sent a cross in the second minute for Ezra Hendrickson.
Dallas' Paul Broome was in position to head it away, but the rarely
used defender mistimed his jump, allowing the ball to roll off his
sleeve to set up a Galaxy penalty kick. Vanney finished from there,
easily beating goalkeeper Mark Dodd for his second goal of the
playoffs and 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Hermosillo, who scored two goals on his wife's birthday last
week, scored on his 11-year-old son's birthday this time, giving
the Galaxy a 2-0 lead in the 20th minute.
</P>
<P>
   The play started on Roy Myers' run down the left side. He
crossed in front for Clint Mathis. Dodd came out to challenge, but
his errant clear rolled in front to Hermosillo, who finished into
an open net.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Note:!off! The Galaxy's Robin Fraser has been named a
finalist for Major League Soccer's 1999 Defender of the Year award.
D.C. United's Jeff Agoos and Chicago's Lubos Kubik are the other
finalists.
</P>
<P>
   The BIC Defender of the Year is awarded to the player judged by
MLS coaching staffs and general managers to be the best defender
during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser, 32, made his first season as team captain a solid one,
helping the Galaxy set a league record for defensive efficiency.
The team became the first in league history to allow less than one
goal per game (29 goals in 32 games for a 0.91 goals-against
average).
</P>
<P>
   With Fraser leading the way, the Galaxy recorded a league-high
11 shutouts.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser is one of four Galaxy finalists up for league awards this
season. First-year coach Sigi Schmid is up for Coach of the Year,
netminder Kevin Hartman is among the favorites for Goalkeeper of
the Year, and Simon Elliott is nominated for Rookie of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   The winners of the the league's 12 awards will be announced next
week.

KINGS DEFEAT COLORADO 5-2
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Kings don't have two-thirds of their No.1
line. Nor do they have their best goalie.
</P>
<P>
   But they do have Ziggy Palffy, Vladimir Tsyplakov, Jamie Storr
and an effective penalty-killing unit. Thursday night at Staples
Center, that was enough to beat Colorado 5-2 in front of 14,323.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy, a right winger, is the lone healthy member of the top
line. Luc Robitaille has a broken foot and Jozef Stumpel is
recovering from hernia surgery. Yet Palffy continued to score,
getting a goal and two assists to give him a team-best 21 points.
His goal gave the Kings a 1-0 lead, and Marko Tuomainen followed 52
seconds later with his fourth of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy later assisted on Tsyplakov's power-play goal in the
second period and Len Barrie's first of the season in the third
period. Tsyplakov scored his second with 2:52 remaining on a
wraparound.
</P>
<P>
   Also, goalie Stephane Fiset is listed as day-to-day after
suffering a contusion on his right hand from being struck by a puck
during Tuesday's pregame warmup. His replacement, Storr, stopped 25
shots in improving to 3-0-1 this season.
</P>
<P>
   Storr stopped four shots in Colorado's first power play. It
appeared Storr moved the puck into the goal after the last shot got
pinned against the post, but referee Don Van Massenhoven ruled the
puck dead.
</P>
<P>
   But Colorado scored on that power play when Chris Dingman banged
a shot off Storr. It's not surprising, since the Kings entered the
game tied for 26th in the league in penalty killing at home.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Klemm added a third-period goal for Colorado, his third of
the season. Colorado played without captain Joe Sakic, who suffered
a stiff back during Monday's practice.
</P>
<P>
   Storr got help from the penalty-killing unit, which is a good
thing because the Kings have been anemic on the power play.
Although Tsyplakov scored on the power play to give the Kings a 3-1
lead, Los Angeles entered Thursday's game having scored in just one
of its last 11 power plays over three games.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche penalty-killing unit had stopped 11 of the last
12, so it didn't need any assistance. Yet twice Los Angeles right
winger Donald Audette committed penalties to kill his team's power
plays.
</P>
<P>
   As if the Kings' power play hasn't been dreadful enough lately,
now they're helping their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter Thursday. The Kings stopped four of five
Colorado power plays through the first two periods.
</P>
<P>
   In the first period, the teams decided to skate instead of fight
_ there wasn't a penalty until King Brad Chartrand was called for
holding a stick.
</P>
<P>
   Twice, Colorado left the left side open, and twice in 52 seconds
the Kings made the Avalanche pay.
</P>
<P>
   First, Palffy stood unguarded next to Colorado goalie Patrick
Roy, received Sean O'Donnell's across-the-slot pass and knocked it
in at 7:24.
</P>
<P>
   Then at 8:16, Tuomainen retrieved a loose puck and beat Roy to
the stick side. It was Tuomainen's fourth goal, all in the last
seven games.
</P>
<P>
   After Los Angeles first goal, the crowd started chanting
``Patrick! Patrick!'' After the second goal, an animated Eric
Cartman from ``South Park'' provided the chant, much to the crowd's
delight.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado outshot Los Angeles 12-10 in the first period and 18-15
through two.
</P>
<P>
   Roy stopped 18 shots.

LEADER SCHUMACHER POSITIONS HIMSELF

<P>
   POMONA _ It's not over yet.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Schumacher, who needs only to qualify for this weekend's
Auto Club NHRA Nationals to clinch his first Top Fuel championship,
failed to put himself safely into Sunday's race following the first
round of qualifying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago native recorded a 4.712-second pass at 300.13 mph,
which is good enough for the No. 9 qualifying position, but puts
him in a precarious position if he's not able to improve in the
final three sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Amato, who won this event in 1997, is No. 1 at 4.610 with
two-time defending Top Fuel champion Gary Scelzi second at 4.613.
Other category leaders are Ron Capps in Funny Car, Warren Johnson
in Pro Stock, Whittier native Matt Hines in Pro Stock Bike and Bob
Panella in Pro Stock Truck.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not concerned'' said Schumacher, who leads Scelzi by 109
points heading into the event. ''If we can't run better then
(4.71), we don't deserve to qualify. It was on a pretty good pass,
then something broke lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Amato, who still has an outside chance at his sixth Top Fuel
championship, isn't counting on similar occurrences for Schumacher
during the rest of the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''They'll do better,'' said Amato, who would still need to win
the event and set a national record to win the title. ''They've
been the most consistent car this season, so you have to figure
they can run quicker. That (4.71) will be close.''
</P>
<P>
   Amato doesn't have that concern after recording his 4.61 at
316.90 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're excited about just getting the car down the track,''
said Amato, who has won a series-high five events this season. ''We
have the (Big Bud Shootout) coming up on Saturday, so we didn't
want to go into the shootout not qualified. We've been down that
road too many times. So we put a conservative, 4.60-second setup on
it. The track is pretty good. It went right down Broadway, and here
we are.''
</P>
<P>
   So is Capps, who achieved his second quickest pass with a 4.868
run at 309.34. Tony Pedregon, who won the season-opening
Winternationals here in February, is second at 4.957. Nine-time
Funny Car champion John Force is not qualified after smoking the
tires almost instantly, slowing to a 19.504.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't change a thing from Houston (two weeks ago),'' said
Capps, who is driving for his fourth crew chief of the season at
this race after Dale Armstrong was replaced by Ed ''Ace'' McCulloch
earlier this week. ''Ace left it alone, just compensating for the
change in air.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just a great run. I clicked it off a tad early,
otherwise it would have been quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who is has recorded the top speed at the past 28
national events, claimed the lead in Pro Stock with a 6.908 pass at
201.07 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ''The conditions were good for us,'' Johnson said. ''It's dry
out there, which produces a lot of speed in a Pro Stock car. The
cars have a tendency to go left at this track. We thought we'd
compensate for that.''

WOMEN MAKE IMPACT IN NHRA COMPETITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH LAIR  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Hot Rod Association prides itself on being the
world's fastest motorsport.
</P>
<P>
   But the Glendora-based organization can also take pride in that
it is the only motorsport where women have seemingly equal access
as drivers or mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   Long before Janet Guthrie and Lyn St. James got their first
chance to take hot laps around Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Indy
Cars, Shirley Muldowney was winning national Top Fuel titles.
</P>
<P>
   In 25 years of national event drag racing, six women have 32
victories in professional events. In the same time, not a single
woman has driven in one NASCAR race and Guthrie and St. James have
been the only women to race in a major open wheel division race.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really a family sport and I think there is an
acceptance of male competitors to female drivers,'' outgoing NHRA
president Dallas Gardner said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the status of women in the sport today is not as rosy
as it was last year, when Covina's Shelly Anderson, San Dimas'
Rhonda Hartman, Cristen Powell and Angelle Seeling were racing in
professional categories. Heading into this weekend's 35th annual
Automobile Club of Southern California NHRA Finals at Pomona
Raceway, only Seeling was racing; the other three were unable to
find sponsorships.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, it's not surprising that the women of Top Fuel
have had trouble finding sponsors in a sport that is self-professed
macho and inspires more testosterone than any other motorsport.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to put your foot on the gas and go,'' said
Connie Kalitta, who helped Muldowney win 18 national events and Top
Fuel titles in 1977, '80 and '82. He scoffs when asked to talk
about Muldowney.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all the women drivers know that we're all in the same
boat and that we all have to face the same things,'' said Powell,
who has landed a Funny Car ride for next season. ``We're not alone
in that.''
</P>
<P>
   So why have women found success?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think their reaction time might be a little better,''
Gardner said. ``I don't think there is any more pure thrill in
other motorsports than to go 100 mph in less than a second. That's
a rush.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaction times can make or break a race that covers 440 yards in
less than 8 seconds. Step on the gas too soon and you've
red-lighted _ you're eliminated. Step on it a fraction of a second
too late and your competitor is already 100 feet in front of you.
</P>
<P>
   Step on the gas too soon in another motorsport? They line the
cars up and restart the race. Get off too slowly? There's plenty of
time and opportunities to make up ground.
</P>
<P>
   The first victory by a woman at a national event was not in the
professional division, but by Shirley Shahan in 1966, driving a
1965 Plymouth 101.23 mph to win the stock title at the
Winternationals at Pomona. Muldowney was the first woman to win a
pro event title, winning in Columbus, Ohio in 1977. Lucille Lee
('82 in Atlanta), Lori Johns (two titles), Anderson (four titles),
Powell ('77 in Morristown, N.J.) and current pro motorcycle points
leader Angelle Seeling (10 victories) are the lone female victors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not take a NASA scientist to race these cars,'' says
Muldowney, who admits to being outspoken at times. ``In NASCAR, it
takes strength and endurance. It takes a lot of strength to do what
those guys are doing. I'm not sure ladies can do what they're
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Drivers were not happy to see Muldowney join the circuit in
1963.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not have any friends,'' she recalls. ``The key was to be
a smart lady and handle going fast. I kicked their butts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, a lot of guys had a tough time swallowing what she
was doing,'' said four-time Funny Car champion and current car
owner Don Prudhomme. ``When (the NHRA) started, it was like, `Oh,
(jeez), fire and shake.' Cars would catch on fire or flip. They
were always crashing. You had to be on top of the game. The bottom
line to it all was that women were thought not to be tough enough
for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Shirley got enough credit for what she did.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, says Ercie Hill, wife of Top Fuel driver Eddie
Hill, is that it takes women longer to be accepted into the NHRA
fraternity.
</P>
<P>
   ``People would ignore me until they saw that I knew what I was
doing,'' Ercie says of her first year in drag racing.
</P>
<P>
   To Shelly Anderson, going racing was just an extension of the
family. Her father, Brad, won three Top Alcohol Funny Car national
titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wanted to do this,'' said Brad Anderson, who was national
champion in 1983, '84 and '89. ``She was kind of a tomboy, anyways.
But it was a matter of affording to do (this). She went out and
found the sponsors and put the deals together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the only way I could do this,'' Shelly said of finding
her first sponsor, Jolly Rancher.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said she has never encountered any resistance, perhaps
because she has worked on her own cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been around this all my life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Powell has been trying to make a switch from Top Fuel to Funny
Car.
</P>
<P>
   ``As NHRA goes, no woman has ever won a national event in Funny
Car,'' she said. ``That was a big turn-on for me. I kept hearing
people say that women can't drive Funny Cars. Not only did that
make me angry, but it's an open door for me. I proved I could drive
dragsters and now I think I've proved I can drive a Funny Car.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeling leads defending champion Matt Himes of Whittier by 14
points as she aims to become the first female national winner since
Muldowney.
</P>
<P>
   Muldowney says it takes something special to win a national
title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, it just clicks,'' she said. ``I know. If you do it
right, everybody's happy and winning. You can't win a title if it's
handed down to you and there is not one lady that I know of that
can talk (Top Fuel) championship.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of ladies need more experience because you can't win
without running on a consistent basis,'' she said.

its foundling relationship with the Feds. The city had handed over
the century-old building and its prime site at 13th and
Pennsylvania Ave. next to the Reagan Building, in hard times, five
years ago. But with economic turnaround, the city pleaded not to

pressure on wages could spur inflation, seems to be much on the

KINGS FIND NEW HEROES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Kings don't have Luc Robitaille or Jozef
Stumpel on the first line with Ziggy Palffy.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, joining Palffy for the second straight game were
Vladimir Tsyplakov, who had no goals, and Len Barrie, recalled from
Long Beach on Monday and scoreless in an NHL game since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, that was enough to beat Colorado and goalie Patrick
Roy. In ending a three-game winless streak, the Kings used a goal
from Palffy during a two-goal-in-52-second run, two from Tsyplakov
and another from Barrie during a 5-2 win over Colorado in front of
14,323 at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings (10-4-2) also won without goalie Stephane Fiset,
listed as day-to-day after suffering a contusion on his right hand
from being struck by a puck during Tuesday's pregame warmup. His
replacement, Jamie Storr, stopped 25 shots Thursday in improving to
3-0-1 this season.
</P>
<P>
   After Tuesday's lackluster 1-1 draw with Edmonton, the Kings
felt good about their offensive production from their first line,
as Palffy assisted twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Ziggy Palffy, you'd better get your stick on the ice
because you're going to get some pucks,'' Kings coach Andy Murray
said. ``I would say it's expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Tsyplakov hadn't scored since April. He finished the scoring
with 2:52 to play, awarded the goal after Roy intentionally lifted
the net forward.
</P>
<P>
   Barrie hadn't been in the NHL in four years but put in 107 goals
in the minors since his last NHL goal. When the Kings brought him
up from Long Beach, he was leading the International League with 10
goals and 20 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why (Kings general manager) Dave Taylor signed me: I'm
depth for the organization,'' Barrie said, ``and I know I can score
in this league because I can score everywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings even scored once on the power play, which hasn't
happened very often. In fact, Los Angeles is two for its last 16
chances.
</P>
<P>
   But the penalty-killing unit remains effective, having stopped
12 of 16.
</P>
<P>
   Storr gave up goals to Chris Dingman on the power play and Jon
Klemm.
</P>
<P>
   Marko Tuomainen also scored for the Kings, giving him four goals
in the last seven games. Colorado goalie Patrick Roy stopped 18
shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a better effort and a better defensive performance
from everyone to win on the road,'' Colorado coach Bob Hartley
said.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado was already missing Peter Forsberg after offseason
shoulder surgery and scratched center Joe Sakic before the game
because of a stiff back he suffered during Monday's practice.

GALAXY ADVANCES TO MLS FINAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ Rarely seen Galaxy president Tim Leiweke visited the
Galaxy locker room before Thursday night's decisive Game 3 match
with Dallas. He said he saw a bunch of focused faces, admitting his
presence may have spoiled the mood.
</P>
<P>
   It was partly because of preparation problems that Leiweke fired
coach Octavio Zambrano in March, replacing him with longtime UCLA
coach Sigi Schmid.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Leiweke's paying Schmid, he certainly got his money's
worth.
</P>
<P>
   In a near flawless performance from start to finish, the
emotionally charged Galaxy delivered two quick punches, then kept
the Burn on its heels, not allowing the pesky group from Dallas to
ever find a rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   Once Galaxy playmaker Mauricio Cienfuegos delivered the biggest
blow in the 68th minute, L.A. knew it was on its way to the Nov. 21
MLS Cup championship game in Foxboro, Mass., eliminating the Burn
3-1 to win the Western Conference championship in front of 25,703
at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Hermosillo and Greg Vanney scored in the first 20 minutes
and Cienfuegos added the finisher to give the Galaxy its second
Western Conference title in four years _ returning L.A. to the site
where it suffered the toughest loss in franchise history, a 3-2
defeat to D.C. United in the inaugural 1996 MLS championship.
</P>
<P>
   Now all L.A. has to do is await the winner of Saturday's
decisive match between Columbus and D.C. United to learn who stands
in the way of the elusive MLS Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully this takes the monkey off of our back because
everyone keeps telling us we lose in big games,'' said Vanney.
``You could see how much this meant to everyone. We have been close
all season, but this was the closest we have ever been tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the crowd was electric. It just seemed like everything was
in our favor.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmid, who won three NCAA titles with the Bruins, talked about
the Galaxy's preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of made a joke and said `If you're really ready for
business, you'll come dressed for business,''' said Schmid. ``And
when they showed up, a lot of guys walked in with jackets and ties.
It's little things like that that sometimes trigger reaction and
gets you going.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always knew this team would roll up their sleeves when they
had to and they were certainly rolled all the way up tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Up 2-0 at halftime, Schmid made sure his players wouldn't allow
Dallas to climb back the way it had in recent playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We promised ourselves we would not let them back this time,''
Schmid said. ``We knew we had to match their effort because Dallas
has shown an ability to keep fighting. They were around the goal,
but we never gave them anything goal-dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   The best work may have come from veteran Paul Caligiuri. The
35-year-old hounded Dallas striker Ariel Graziani, who had scored
three goals in the series entering Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   Graziani never got off a shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took it personally because I got tired of reading and
hearing about Graziani,'' said Caligiuri. ``He scored three great
goals against us and I didn't want that to happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   After a few showers of champagne, it didn't take long for the
players to start talking about '96 and a possible rematch with
United.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would take either of them (D.C. or Columbus), but D.C.
would be a good matchup because of what happened before,'' said
Vanney. ``But we're not going to complain if Columbus shows up
because we think it's about how we play and not who's on the other
side.''
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy didn't waste any time testing Dallas' thin backline _
playing without starters Eric Dade and Brandon Pollard.
</P>
<P>
   Vanney sent a cross in the second minute for Ezra Hendrickson.
Dallas' Paul Broome was in position to head it away, but the rarely
used defender misjudged the ball, letting it roll off his sleeve
and set up a Galaxy penalty kick. Vanney finished from there,
beating goalkeeper Mark Dodd for his second goal of the playoffs
and 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Hermosillo, who scored two goals on his wife's birthday last
week, scored on his 11-year-old son's birthday this time, giving
the Galaxy a 2-0 lead in the 20th minute.
</P>
<P>
   The play started on Roy Myers' run down the left side. He
crossed in front for Clint Mathis. Dodd came out to challenge, but
his errant clear rolled in front of Hermosillo, who finished into
an open net.

<P>
   Witching hour approaches. Goblins and gremlins and ghouls will
set mischief loose in the world. Fear will add its chill to the
winds that sweep through the streets. With every sunset, solid
citizens know they're another day closer to... Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have a right to feel nervous. When it's time to roll
over to the double zeros of 2000, some computers won't make the
transition. Undiscovered software bugs will leave the poor machines
stuck in 1900 or hopelessly dithering over the date.
</P>
<P>
   In the worst-case scenario, automatic teller machines could
refuse to spit out cash, electrical utility grids could fail, and
entire industries could come to a halt when their computerized
inventory-control and manufacturing systems stop answering
commands.
</P>
<P>
   The chance that anything so cataclysmic might happen is small,
but real. The truth is that nobody knows for sure what will happen.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market hates uncertainty _ its inability to predict
whether or not the Federal Reserve Board will raise interest rates
a piddling 25 basis points is enough to send the indexes tumbling.
</P>
<P>
   So imagine the intensity of investor reaction to a genuinely
chilling possibility, no matter how remote.
</P>
<P>
   A stock such as Lucent Technologies fell 9 percent on July 20,
when Wall Street analysts decided that a passing remark by a
company executive about a possible slowdown in sales during the
quarter ending in December was a sign that the curse of Y2K had hit
the company.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately it will pay more this winter to be attentive and
thoughtful than to be frightened, because Y2K will mean both tricks
and treats.
</P>
<P>
   For every company that shows lower sales and earnings, others
will report unexpectedly strong results.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. investors may decide to head for the sidelines, pulling
money out of financial markets in favor of the security of cash.
But foreign investors, especially those with money in emerging
markets, are likely to flee to the comparative safety of the U.S.
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Focusing on the tricks the Y2K bug may play on investors means
paying attention to only part of the story.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at the auto industry. The big U.S.-based automakers
such as Ford and General Motors are exactly the kinds of companies
most susceptible to the bite of the year-2000 bug.
</P>
<P>
   They sit at the top of immensely long supply chains: Their
assembly lines require interior assemblies from Lear and body
frames from Tower Automotive, for example. Those suppliers rely on
even smaller suppliers for everything from screws to vinyl.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these parts are delivered by computerized just-in-time
inventory systems that try to keep parts on hand to a minimum. Any
disruption to that flow, and the computerized manufacturing systems
that churn out cars will grind to a halt for days or weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, auto executives know this _ and know that no matter
how rigorously they've tested their own internal systems the
carmakers are at the mercy of systems failures anywhere in the
supply chain.
</P>
<P>
   So what have these companies been doing? Well, they have asked
suppliers to ensure that their own systems are bug-free _ and
they've temporarily turned their just-in-time inventory systems
into just-in-case insurance policies by stockpiling larger than
normal supplies of critical components. Momentary glitches won't
shut this industry down.
</P>
<P>
   You'll see the same thing in industry after industry, with the
same essential effect: The numbers in company reports will be
confusing, and stock prices will be unusually volatile.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that increase inventories are adding costs and
temporarily depressing earnings. It will take quick footwork to
convince Wall Street analysts that measures intended to prevent
truly serious problems aren't reasons to lower long-term
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors won't get the message, of course, and they'll
liquidate long-term positions on essentially meaningless changes in
quarterly numbers.
</P>
<P>
   While some companies are recording higher costs as a result of
building inventory, others in the same industry will be showing
unexpectedly strong sales as customers step up orders so they, too,
can stockpile critical components.
</P>
<P>
   Investors shouldn't get too excited by that good news, either.
Those increased sales in the current quarter will lead to reduced
sales in future quarters when customers cut back on purchases in
order to work down inventory to normal, just-in-time levels.
</P>
<P>
   Smoothing out the trend to get a picture of what's really going
on will require intensive research and number crunching by analysts
and investors.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors will opt to sell instead of putting in the work
to figure out what the numbers mean _ after all, the conventional
wisdom is that the approach of the millennium will send share
prices down as worried individuals move to good old low-tech cash.
</P>
<P>
   But even here, the potential treats will temper the effect of
the potential tricks. Safety is a relative term, after all, and
from the perspective of individuals who have most of their money in
the stock markets of Brazil, Mexico, and Taiwan, the U.S. financial
markets look positively Y2K-bug proof.
</P>
<P>
   And U.S. banks, as well as European-based global banks, are
likely to see an inflow of cash from wealthy foreigners who think
having a bit of cash in New York or Miami is just a prudent hedge
against systems failure back home. Foreign corporations are likely
to make similar moves.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that the approach of the millennium will move
numbers _ at individual companies and in entire financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   The short-term changes in the figures, for better or worse, will
be big enough that analysts and investors will have a hard time
ignoring them. The market can be counted on to make too much of the
short-term trend: Research shows that the market tends to project
short-term change further into the future than the facts warrant.
</P>
<P>
   Temporary volatility in earnings or global cash flows will seem
more important than they are because of this tendency.
</P>
<P>
   The market will eventually get it right and correct those
errors. But that adjustment will take time, and while the market
works its way through this volatility, there will be more than
enough moments that seem truly horrifying.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who allow the momentary fright to scare them out of
long-term holdings are likely to regret it.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who can shrug off the scare and buy individual
equities when some loud ``boo'' has sent other investors running
for cover are likely to find their bags full of treats long after
the goblins have been put to bed. &QL;

   Witching hour approaches. Goblins and gremlins and ghouls will
set mischief loose in the world. Fear will add its chill to the
winds that sweep through the streets. With every sunset, solid
citizens know they're another day closer to... Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have a right to feel nervous. When it's time to roll
over to the double zeros of 2000, some computers won't make the
transition. Undiscovered software bugs will leave the poor machines
stuck in 1900 or hopelessly dithering over the date.
</P>
<P>
   In the worst-case scenario, automatic teller machines could
refuse to spit out cash, electrical utility grids could fail, and
entire industries could come to a halt when their computerized
inventory-control and manufacturing systems stop answering
commands.
</P>
<P>
   The chance that anything so cataclysmic might happen is small,
but real. The truth is that nobody knows for sure what will happen.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market hates uncertainty _ its inability to predict
whether or not the Federal Reserve Board will raise interest rates
a piddling 25 basis points is enough to send the indexes tumbling.
</P>
<P>
   So imagine the intensity of investor reaction to a genuinely
chilling possibility, no matter how remote.
</P>
<P>
   A stock such as Lucent Technologies fell 9 percent on July 20,
when Wall Street analysts decided that a passing remark by a
company executive about a possible slowdown in sales during the
quarter ending in December was a sign that the curse of Y2K had hit
the company.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately it will pay more this winter to be attentive and
thoughtful than to be frightened, because Y2K will mean both tricks
and treats.
</P>
<P>
   For every company that shows lower sales and earnings, others
will report unexpectedly strong results.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. investors may decide to head for the sidelines, pulling
money out of financial markets in favor of the security of cash.

 THIEVES LIKELY COULDN'T PEDDLE MASTERPIECES  &HT;     By STACY FINZ and DAN LEVY 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It's not easy to fence a hot Rembrandt. What's
an art thief to do _ sell it on eBay?
</P>
<P>
   That's why some missing art pieces are stashed away in attics
and others are held for ransom _ and perhaps why ``Portrait of a
Rabbi'' and two other Dutch Master paintings, stolen from a San
Francisco museum almost 21 years ago, were mysteriously dumped at a
New York auction house last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the fact that it has been returned says a lot,'' said
Sharon Flescher, executive director of the International Foundation
for Art Research in New York. ``The more famous and prominent the
work, the more difficult it is to sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports of art thefts in the United States and overseas have
more than tripled in the last 20 years, according to the Australian
Institute of Criminology. But unless an art collector has hired
someone to steal a well-known work, big-ticket items are difficult
to unload, say art world insiders.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the thefts are well-publicized. Stephen Turner,
director of online auctions and appraisals at Butterfield and
Butterfield in San Francisco, said his gallery receives three or
four publications a year alerting them of what has been stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities do not know who took ``Portrait of a Rabbi'' and
three other artworks from the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum in
Golden Gate Park on Christmas Eve 1978. And they can only speculate
where they have been for the last 21 years.
</P>
<P>
   But Turner, for one, does not think that the bandits who took
the 17th century paintings knew what to do with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, whoever did this botched it,'' he said. ``They
probably didn't have a buyer for the paintings, and for 21 years,
they've been carrying around this monkey on their backs.''
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, museum officials believed that the theft _
though daring _ was carried out by amateurs. After climbing through
the de Young's skylight, the thieves grabbed a Rembrandt whose
authenticity was in question, along with less noted paintings.
Collectively, they were worth at least a million dollars, but left
behind was artwork worth much more.
</P>
<P>
   It is also apparent that the paintings were not cared for
properly after they were stolen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Portrait of a Rabbi'' is now marred by a large, rectangular
splotch over the face, apparently caused by a bungled attempt to
clean the painting's varnish, said Lynn Orr, curator of European
painting for the de Young.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the canvas was frayed in some parts and had become
detached from its frame.
</P>
<P>
   The other two recovered works _ Aert van der Neer's ``River
Scene at Night'' and Anthonie de Lorme's ``Interior of the Church
of St. Lawrence,'' both painted on wooden panels _ have split and
buckled in several places.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Fausel, the director of art at William Doyle Galleries in
New York City, where the paintings were dropped off anonymously,
attributes the damage to bad storage. He says for proper
preservation, the artworks should have been kept in a
climate-controlled environment.
</P>
<P>
   Fausel said it is not uncommon for art that falls into amateurs'
hands to receive less than ``museum treatment.'' Just 10 years ago,
he found a Rembrandt etching stashed in an old attic in a house on
Long Island. The piece was restored and later sold for $990,000.
</P>
<P>
   He said historians did not know whether the etching had been
passed down from generation to generation or whether it had been
stolen and hidden in the attic when it could not be sold.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes thieves will steal pricey pieces of art with the hope
of holding them for ransom.
</P>
<P>
   That was the fear nine years ago, when two men posed as police
officers, gained entrance into the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum
in Boston and left with $200 million worth of art. Authorities
never recovered the works, and some suspect the pieces may have
been moved overseas to wealthy collectors who commissioned the
heist.
</P>
<P>
   The belief is that those pieces, like most stolen art, will
eventually turn up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may take a generation or it may take five generations,''
Fausel said, ``but they're bound to be recovered at some point.''
</P>
<P>
   Flescher points to a late Impressionist piece painted by Camille
Pissarro. The 1902 painting was stolen from a wealthy home in
Worcester, Mass. But it turned up 21 years later at an auction
house in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth painting stolen from the de Young, Willem van de
Velde's ``Harbor Scene,'' is still missing. It is not as well known
as ``Portrait of a Rabbi,'' and Fausel believes that it may have
been sold on the black market.
</P>
<P>
   The recovered de Young paintings are expected to return to San
Francisco in two weeks, after the FBI finishes examining them for
clues. At that point, museum officials plan to restore the works.
</P>
<P>
   One of the questions to be answered about ``Portrait of a
Rabbi'' is whether Rembrandt really painted it. Art historians said
Thursday there is a strong possibility that the piece was not
painted by the master.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was normal practice in any great studio to have help from
students or assistants,'' said Svetlana Alpers, a retired professor
of art history at the University of California at Berkeley.
``Rembrandt didn't do every painting. That's the way he conducted
his business and his art.''
</P>
<P>
   Works purportedly by Rembrandt have been particularly
controversial in recent years. During the last decade, a Dutch
research group has been trying to authenticate the artist's entire
body of work.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most notable cases of misattribution involved the
famous ``Man with a Golden Helmet.'' It was determined in 1985 to
have been painted by someone other than Rembrandt.
</P>
<P>
   Authentic or not, ``Portrait of a Rabbi'' will eventually be
hung at the California Palace of the Legion of Honor, said Dede
Wilsey, president of the Fine Arts Museums board.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, the important thing is to try to restore the painting
and have it on display,'' she said. ``Even if it turns out not to
be a Rembrandt, people will come see it for the curiosity factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Wanda Corn, chairwoman of Stanford University's art and art
history department, said, ``I think it's wonderful that we have our
paintings back. It shows that someone felt guilty or desperate to
get rid of the hot property.''

BUSH, MCCAIN IN DEAD HEAT FOR PRIMARY
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI and PAMELA J. PODGER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Tearing away at Texas Governor &LR; . George W. Bush's aura of
invincibility, Arizona Sen. John McCain has pulled into a dead heat
with the GOP front-runner in New Hampshire, turning the 2000
Republican presidential nomination into a genuine contest for the
first time.
<P>
   A poll of voters in the key primary state showed that Bush's
favorability rating has dropped a full 15 percentage points since
last month. Thirty-eight percent favor Bush and 35 percent favor
McCain _ a statistical tie _ in the American Research Poll released
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's latest gains came after Bush did not appear at two
televised New Hampshire debates, prompting criticism that he was
taking the state for granted.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, the front-runner flubbed a televised quiz on
foreign policy, failing to name the leaders of four global trouble
spots. That has made Bush the butt of late-night television jokes
and raised questions about his command of important issues.
</P>
<P>
   The slip comes as Bush is slated to travel to California next
week to deliver what has been billed a ``major foreign policy
address'' at the Ronald Reagan Library in Simi Valley _ a stop
scheduled long before his current troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Scott McClellan, spokesman for Bush, played down the results of
the latest poll, which surveyed 600 GOP voters in New Hampshire.
``Governor Bush has always said this primary would be
competitive,'' McClellan said. ``He will continue working hard to
earn the support of voters in New Hampshire, and across America.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Bush added New Hampshire trips to his calendar,
moved up his debate schedule and promised to smother voters with
personal attention, according to the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   But with 10 weeks to go before the first votes are cast in the
race _ in Iowa on January 24 _ the poll and the TV fiasco have
fueled speculation that Bush, who rocketed to the GOP front-runner
slot, faces some erosion of support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush has been arguing for several months that he's
the strongest candidate in the field. Now, in the first primary
states, it's no longer the case,'' Dan Schnur, McCain's California
communications director, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He said that in California, which holds its primary March 7,
``we don't expect to see significant poll movement until after the
New Hampshire primary. But the candidate who wins New Hampshire is
going to attract a huge amount of media and public attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign argues that the front-runner's position is
secure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush knows this campaign is about ideas, and he's
continuing to lay out his ideas, from improving schools to
strengthening the military,'' said Bush spokesman Scott McClellan.
``America wants someone with a proven ability to lead and clear
ideas where to take America.''
</P>
<P>
   But in California, the nation's most populous state _ where Bush
is still far ahead of his opponents not only in the polls but also
in campaign donations and endorsements _ some Republicans now say
they're taking a second look.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was an early supporter of George W. Bush, and I am now
losing some confidence,'' said Jerry Patrick, a Republican who runs
a high-tech marketing firm in San Francisco and showed up to hear
challenger Steve Forbes this week in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I detect a weakening in Bush, in that he has peaked too soon.
I think he is a shallow enough person that there is not much left.
I think he doesn't have the equipment to forge ahead in the next
four to five months.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Corey Moore, a marketing research executive in San Jose,
``Bush sort of reminds me of a tin man. I think he comes across as
a snake-oil salesman and a little weaselly.'' Moore said he prefers
McCain to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Such tough words about Bush were hardly spoken here just a few
months ago. They suggest that the candidate's armor has been
pierced after Bush took heat over his handling of drug questions,
shunning of debates and his performance on the foreign policy quiz.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line: Late-night television hosts David Letterman and
Jay Leno have opened their shows with biting monologues on Bush's
gray matter _ or lack of it. That, political insiders say, is every
campaign's nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Fear of Jokes
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to have a bad story about your candidate in the
newspaper, but when Leno and Letterman start telling nightly jokes,
you've got a much bigger problems &LR; ,'' said a leading GOP
strategist.
</P>
<P>
   ``More people get their information from the late-night shows
than even those voters who read the newspapers faithfully. Leno and
Letterman give them an indication of what to think about a subject.
(Dan) Quayle is the best example of that.''
</P>
<P>
   University of California at Berkeley anthropology professor Alan
Dundes, a renowed expert on humor, agreed that the jibes from
well-known personalities, more than pundits, ``have a lot of impact
... a devastating effect. (Politicians) can't get their spin
doctors to undo all this. ... It's communicated over the water
cooler and the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans like knocking the front-runner,'' Dundes added. ``We
love to root for the underdog. We like upsets, even in football.
It's part of the American joy in deflating pomposity. We don't like
people who put on airs. There's a little bit of this `cut 'em down
to size' thing.''

   Pollster Mark Baldassare said Bush's handling of the foreign
policy questions is troubling to voters because it underscores
deeper doubts about the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason that these foreign policy tests are important for
(Bush) is that ... his most formidable challenger _ John McCain _
is in the Senate and knows quite a bit about it,'' he said.
``Ultimately, the question is: How prepared is he to be president
of the United States?''
</P>
<P>
   Baldassare predicts that Bush's foreign policy speech in Simi
Valley will be closely watched and could determine how he is
covered in crucial future months in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expectations will be fairly high (to show) he's knowledgeable
and not reading off cue cards. He will have to show he has this
deep knowledge, not just gained personally from his circle of
advisers,'' Baldassare said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's going to convince people one time out. A
series of tests are coming, as there should be.''

STINKING BREATH, BADGES, BAGGAGE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO _ Deep thoughts, cheap shots and bon mots ...
<P>
   THOSE CIGARETTE executives who swear under oath that tobacco is
good for you, I wonder what they tell their kids.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Young lady, you will not be excused from the table until you &LR; 
 &UR; finish your after-dinner cigar. Children in China are having &LR; 
 &UR; nicotine fits. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   I'M TIRED of hearing people use the phrase, ``We don't need no
stinking badges.''
</P>
<P>
   In the movie ``Treasure of the Sierra Madre,'' here's the
dialogue between the Mexican bandito and Humphrey Bogart's
character:
</P>
<P>
   ``Oiga (listen), senor, we are Federales. You know, the mounted
police.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are police, where are your badges?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Badges? We ain't got no badges. We don't need no badges. I
don't have to show you any stinking badges.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheesh. Get it right.
</P>
<P>
   SPEAKING OF stinking, chef Paul Bertolli and owner Bob Klein of
Oliveto in Oakland recently returned from their annual white
truffle hunt in Italy (truffle dinners through Saturday at
Oliveto).
</P>
<P>
   They bagged their limit, sacked up 10 kilos (22 pounds) of the
pungent fungus and hand-carried 'em home on their Alitalia flight.
Several days later, the captain of that flight told Paul and Bob
that the ground crew was still trying to get the truffle smell out
of the first-class cabin.
</P>
<P>
   Funny. It's an Italian crew. You'd think they'd find a way to
say arrivederci aroma.
</P>
<P>
   SURELY THERE IS a simple explanation, but I worry about
hyphenated last names. Specifically, what happens with succeeding
generations? For instance, what will be the surname of kids born to
Glenda Gluteus-Maximus and Fernando Lasorda-Cerveza?
</P>
<P>
   THE UNION SQUARE Garage has a generic ATM that sucks a $1.50
surcharge out of your account with each withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Since it's a city garage, Rich Herrera wonders if the city will
demand that its own ATM stop charging a surcharge. Could get ugly.
</P>
<P>
   MENU OPTIONS. They keep changing. Everywhere you call, it's:
``Please listen carefully, we have changed our menu options.''
</P>
<P>
   I say it's a trick to get you to pay attention instead of just
punching random buttons and causing some actual human being to put
down his or her Mad magazine and actually answer a damn phone.
</P>
<P>
   I'LL PAY the buck-fifty surcharge for using the wrong ATM, if my
bank will credit me a buck-fifty every time they put me on hold and
make me listen to music that's not my preferred genre.
</P>
<P>
   THE CAR INDUSTRY is suffering a shortage of new model names, I
hear. Jim Blake and daughter Jenny suggest naming cars after foods
or diseases. Chevy Casserole. Ford Fondue. Pontiac Paranoia. Dodge
Dyslexia. And Eric Eichorn suggests Ferrari Testosterossa.
</P>
<P>
   Or what about: Dodge Dubious, Ford Flatulent, Plymouth Pequod,
Subaru Superfluous, Ford Folderol, Honda Dogmatic, Cadillac
Skedaddle.
</P>
<P>
   LOTTA DOTZ was in Costa Rica, inserted ATM card in ATM, screen
flashed message: ``Insufficient funds _ Us, not you.''
</P>
<P>
   ENOUGH ALREADY on the cigarette taxing. We can only milk that
cow so many times before the well runs dry, to coin a phrase. If I
was a smoker, one more tax and I'd start growing my own.
</P>
<P>
   TO BE CHISELED on my tombstone: ``Can I please get a
periscope?''
</P>
<P>
   ENOUGH, ALREADY of the trend to bemoan the death of letter
writing in this age of e-mail. If you write a letter and you're not
famous, nobody gives a whit about it.
</P>
<P>
   If you are famous, they save your letters and publish 'em in a
book to embarrass the hell out of you. Who needs it?
</P>
<P>
   THIS CAST? Surfing injury. Yep, sprained my elbow reaching for
the clicker I dropped between the couch cushions.
</P>
<P>
   PEOPLE ARE very strange. Janet Shahan noticed that page 69 of
the new S.F. phone book's business pages covers listings from
DEMENTED to DEVILBOY, and has listings for ``Departures _ From the
Past,'' ``Depression Resource Center,'' ``Detox &AMP; Rehab Help Line''
and ``Democratic Party of San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   I VOTE for voices, especially in the big offices, like
president. Eight years of Clinton's pseudo-sincere twangy whine was
about seven years too many. Gore? Sounds like the preacher in ``The
Simpsons.'' I'm writing in James Earl Jones.
</P>
<P>
   SEND NOW for your copy of my new ``Breakfast Boy's Toast Cook
Book.''
</P>
<P>
   Recipes include Toast Flambe (a touch of lighter fluid), Toast
Tartare (toaster unplugged), Cajun Style Toast (crank that darkness
dial full right), Toast 'n' Turf (toast sprinkled with A-1 Steak
Sauce), Toast L'Orange Under Glass (toast doubling as coaster for
glass of orange juice), Toastquito (toast wrapped 'round a
mysterious beef substance).
</P>
<P>
   NOBODY names boys Sherlock anymore. Maybe they're afraid of what
people would say to their son when he stated an obvious fact.
</P>
<P>
   I DON'T lift weights, diet and do Jazzer-tae-bo to attract women
or impress people or feel good. I do it because I'm afraid that if
I die fat and sloppy, I won't get my security deposit back when I
turn in my body.

   ATLANTA -- From vessels to valves, doctors are engineering
replacement parts for ailing hearts as well as improving arteries
for bypass surgery. And now -- for the first time -- a complete
heart valve has been grown in the lab using cells from blood vessel
walls in sheep, researchers reported Sunday at the American Heart
Association meeting here.
</P>
<P>
   The sheep cells were seeded into a biodegradable, synthetic
form, or scaffold. As they grew, they were subjected to increasing
flows and pressures to mimic the blood flow patterns in the heart,
which made the growing valve stronger. After 14 days, the cells had
grown into the desired shape -- including flaplike structures that
allow the blood to flow in only one direction.
</P>
<P>
   The valves were surgically implant Henry said two months is too
early to draw conclusions; the peak response time probably comes
later than that.
</P>
<P>
   Another strategy reported Sunday looked at reconditioning a
patient's own veins with a DNA ``bath'' to improve the success rate
of leg bypass operations.
</P>
<P>

Hospital in Boston, said that up to 5 ,Y$rMGFUQ

   This is ``a banner year'' for enrolling first-year black
students at Texas's public law schools, but 90 percent of them are
attending one school -- historically black Texas Southern
University, state higher education officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Educators say the scant enrollment of blacks at predominantly
white law schools shows how the end of affirmative action in
college admissions still hampers minority enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 212 blacks are first-year law students among the four
state-supported schools. In 1997, only 159 blacks began law
studies. That was a year after Texas colleges dropped race as an
admissions factor because of a reverse-discrimination court ruling

   As a U.S. bankruptcy judge nears final decision on whether to
allow Dow Corning Corp. to close the books on thousands of breast
implant-related lawsuits, the Hearst News Service and the Midland
Daily News examine the controversy that put the company out of the
implant business and forced it to seek bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Dow Corning _ once the world's largest producer of
silicone gel breast implants _ filed for bankruptcy protection in
1995, the company had paid out $500 million in verdicts,
settlements and legal costs. The company was facing nearly 19,000
new lawsuits alleging that silicone breast implants caused serious
diseases such as lupus and scleroderma.
</P>
<P>
   Since then more than 20 scientific studies have shown no link
between silicone implants and serious diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Against this background, many of the 40,000 residents of
Midland, Mich., wonder why Dow Corning's implant business came to
such a cataclysmic ending.
</P>
<P>
   The following package of stories and photos is designed to
answer that question and to explore the relationships between the
legal system, federal regulators, Dow Corning and the scientific
community. Photos are available on the Wieck database.
</P>
<P>
   The full package is for release Sunday, Nov. 21. Editors wishing
a two-day display might consider this lineup:

   BREAST-IMPLANTS-RDP (Midland, Mich.) _ With scientific research
showing no link between silicone breast implants and disease, the
residents of Midland express wonder and anger over how Dow Corning
Corp., a company they see as responsible and supportive, could be
put through a blizzard of lawsuits and public criticism. We assess
the economic and emotional impact of the implant crisis on the
community where they were produced. By DAN FREEDMAN, JENNIFER
CORBETT DOOREN and CHERYL WADE.
</P>
<P>
   BREAST-IMPLANTS-FDA (Washington) _ Silicone breast implants _
virtually banned in the United States since 1992 _ may be back on
the market in the next several years if the federal Food and Drug
Administration finds that the devices are ``safe and effective,''
the agency's standard for allowing them to be marketed. Two
California manufacturers are working to get FDA approval. By ERIC
ROSENBERG.
</P>
<P>
   BREAST-IMPLANTS-STUDY (Washington) _ A long-awaited government
study of silicone breast implant safety has stirred sharp criticism
from scientists, plastic surgeons and implant makers, even though
the results of the study aren't yet known. The study by the federal
government's premier cancer research center, the National Cancer
Institute, is being attacked for alleged bias. By ERIC ROSENBERG.
</P>
<P>
   BREAST-IMPLANTS-LESSONS (Midland, Mich.) _ How do Dow Corning
Corp. executives assess their performance during the implant
crisis? Company managers say that, with the benefit of hindsight,
they would have done some things differently in two categories, the
public relations aspect that exploded when the controversy first
exploded in late 1990 and early 1991, and Dow Corning's errors in
the development and marketing of implants from the 1960s through
the 1980s. DAN FREEDMAN.
</P>
<P>
   BREAST-IMPLANTS-KESSLER (Washington) _ Dr. David Kessler, the
former Food and Drug Administration commissioner, defends his 1992
decision to ban silicone breast implants, saying it was justified
by the state of scientific knowledge at the time. ``What we know
today is that there is no significant risk of these devices causing
systemic disease,'' he said. By ERIC ROSENBERG.
</P>
<P>
   BREAST-IMPLANTS-LAWYER (San Francisco) _ Dan Bolton, the first
attorney to successfully sue Dow Corning Corp. over allegations
that silicone breast implants cause autoimmune disease, now says he
won't argue with the scientific evidence refuting those claims. The
nearly two dozen scientific studies released since his 1991
landmark case ``are hard to explain away,'' Bolton conceded in an
interview. By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN.

MIDLAND IS ANGRY, PERPLEXED ABOUT BREAST IMPLANT CONTROVERSY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Nov. 21)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN, JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN and CHERYL WADE  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDLAND, Mich. _ When the breakfast regulars at Shirlene's
Cuisine restaurant talk about the breast implant controversy, the
discussion ranges from outright anger to head-scratching
bewilderment.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Corning Corp., headquartered nearby, made this placid city
ground zero in the war over allegations that implants cause
disease. The company was the world's leading manufacturer of
silicone gel implants. And the safety of breast implants was topic
No. 1 at Shirleen's in the early 1990s when the war over implants
raged.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with scientific research finding no link between implants
and disease, the Shirlene's crowd wonders why Dow Corning was
forced to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to women who filed
lawsuits, and why it had to seek federal bankruptcy protection and
get out of the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing was a tragedy,'' said Wayne Crosby, a real
estate broker and regular among the small-business owners and
executives who gather at Shirlene's. ``(American) society jumped on
us here.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Miller, an insurance executive and another Shirlene's
breakfast regular, expressed puzzlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand how we got from there to here without
anyone proving anything,'' Miller said. ``There was never ever
substantial proof that (implants) were causing ill effects.''
</P>
<P>
   At its heart, the implant crisis is a tale of what happens when
science, industry and the law keep separate timetables and fail to
connect. And one of its legacies is a small American city of 40,000
trying to figure out what hit it.
</P>
<P>
   For Crosby, Miller and many others here, Midland and Dow Corning
were the victims of waves of negative publicity, money-hungry
plaintiffs' lawyers and a legal system that ran amok before the
scientific research on implants was in.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a flood of lawsuits from women claiming Dow Corning
implants had threatened their health, the company sought bankruptcy
protection in 1995. By then, Dow Corning already had paid out over
$500 million in implant-related lawsuit judgments, settlements and
legal costs.
</P>
<P>
   The Chapter 11 filing was a strategic calculation by the company
to hold back the lawsuit tide until science had time to judge
whether implants cause disease.
</P>
<P>
   The implant controversy unfolded at a time when feminism and
skepticism about large corporations were in full bloom. In 1991,
law professor Anita Hill's explosives charges of misconduct by
Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas put sexual harassment on the
map. That same year, author Susan Faludi published ``Backlash: The
Undeclared War Against American Women.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, health-related controversies such as the one involving
the Dalkon Shield birth control device had put many women on guard
about safety claims of medical device manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Through the news media, the nation saw a deep-pockets
corporation accused of developing and marketing an untested, unsafe
product to thousands of women seeking to improve their looks or
complete their recovery from breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But people in Midland saw a trusted friend and neighbor on the
ropes, as well as a way of life possibly going down the drain.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the company's 2,700 employees initially feared for their
jobs. For everyone else, the implications also were worrying. Dow
Corning, together with its larger and better-known parent, The Dow
Chemical Co., pays 27 percent of Midland's tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Dow-related foundations have pumped $28.8 million into town
improvements since the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This town isn't held up by a lot,'' said Miller. ``It's
basically a one-horse town.''
</P>
<P>
   As things turned out, the horse rolled over once or twice and
now is getting back up on its feet.
</P>
<P>
   Implants were never more than 1 percent of Dow Corning's sales,
so shutting down the implant assembly line at the company's plant
in nearby Hemlock was no great headache. The company continued to
make other silicone-based products for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Corning now is a $2.5 billion business. It has submitted a
$4.5 billion plan which would allow the company to emerge from
bankruptcy. The plan is under review by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Arthur J. Spector in Bay City, Mich., who is expected to rule
within weeks.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the plan, $3.2 billion would be used mostly to settle
lawsuits. Dow Corning made a calculation that settling is less
expensive than fighting each one in court, where the cost per trial
runs as high as $1 million ``even if we win,'' according to Barie
Carmichael, the company's chief communications officer.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining $1.3 billion could be used to pay commercial
creditors.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the bankruptcy filing, the scientific world had
not answered the central question of whether silicone breast
implants caused diseases of the body's immune system such as lupus,
scleroderma or rheumatoid arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with increasing unanimity, scientific researchers are
saying the answer is ``No.'' The final word is not in, but more
than 20 medical studies in the past five years have shown that
women with implants do not suffer higher rates of those diseases
than women without implants.
</P>
<P>
   For some scientists, the studies completely undercut the caution
that has guided federal policy on implants.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all practical purposes, (implants) are safe,'' said Dr.
Marcia Angell, editor of the New England Journal of Medicine and
author of the 1997 book ``Science on Trial,'' which questioned the
legal world's rush to judgment on implants before science had
spoken.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that seven years had elapsed since then Food &AMP; Drug
Administration Commissioner David Kessler imposed a ban on
implants, Angell said ``it's time'' to lift the ban.
</P>
<P>
   John Eesley, a coin laundry operator and another Shirlene's
regular, is puzzled why Dow Corning is being forced to remain in
bankruptcy proceedings if the scientific jury has exonerated the
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Dow Corning had been guilty of something, then God knows
they ought to pay,'' said Eesley. ``They weren't and they aren't,
but they're still paying. That makes me mad.''
</P>
<P>
   In their own search for explanations, some Midland residents
zero in on the American legal system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our legal system today is a glorified transfer of wealth, with
the attorneys getting a percentage,'' said Dennis Starner, an
insurance salesman and one of the more vocal Shirlene's
participants. ``It's a cultural phenomenon fueled by greed.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Dow Corning had 137 product liability lawsuits filed
against it. By 1995 _ the year Dow Corning filed for bankruptcy law
protection _ that number had grown to 19,000.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Corning's glass-and-concrete headquarters is set amid
farmland outside town. In the modest third-floor executive suites _
little more than oversized cubicles enclosed by partition walls _
senior managers say they feel vindicated by science.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't quite gotten to the `Whoopee' stage yet,'' said
Richard Hazleton, who earlier this year stepped down as Dow
Corning's CEO after six tumultuous years at the helm. ``There's a
feeling of confidence and sense of reassurance that we weren't way
off base with this thing from the very beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Dow Corning counter that no matter what the recent
studies show, the company originally marketed a product without
knowing whether it was safe and did little to warn women once
doubts were raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is they should have studied the device in
women,'' said Dr. Diana Zuckerman, who as an aide to the late Rep.
Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., was among the first to put questions about
implants in the national spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Corning was formed in the midst of World War II in 1943 by
Dow Chemical and Corning Inc. of Corning, N.Y. Combining Dow's
knowledge of chemistry and Corning's expertise with glass, the new
company developed industrial uses for silicone, which is derived
from quartz and sand.
</P>
<P>
   Silicone combines the temperature and chemical resistance of
glass with the flexibility of plastic. The company's first product
was a grease-like compound used to seal the ignition systems of
U.S. warplanes. Today, silicone is used in adhesives, lubricants,
paints, bathtub caulk, household cleaning supplies, cosmetics and
hair-care products.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MORE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Implants began rolling off Dow Corning's assembly line in the
early 1960s, the high-water mark of America's obsession with
breasts as ``sexual ornaments _ the crown jewels of femininity,''
according to author Marilyn Yalom in her 1997 book ``A History of
the Breast.''
</P>
<P>
   The advertising industry and Playboy magazine had succeeded in
turning the breast into a commercialized icon for men. The fashion
world and women's magazines imparted the message to women that
sizable breasts were an integral part of being sexy.
</P>
<P>
   From its inception, Dow Corning was part of the Dow corporate
umbrella that dates back to the 1890s when Herbert Henry Dow came
to Midland to extract bromine and chlorine from underground brine
deposits. ``Crazy Dow,'' as he was known at the time, founded Dow
Chemical Co. in 1897. Chlorine bleach was his leading product.
</P>
<P>
   The company produced mustard gas for the U.S. army in World War
I. Dow survived controversy over its production of napalm, jellied
gasoline dropped by U.S. war planes in Vietnam, and Agent Orange, a
chemical defoliant used in Vietnam to clear thick underbrush.
</P>
<P>
   So controversy over breast implants was ``not an unusual
situation for the people of Midland,'' said Midland city manager
Karl Tomion.
</P>
<P>
   Midland was always willing to overlook accusations against Dow
in part because of the immense generosity to the community of
Dow-connected foundations. They have chipped in to build a dozen or
more public sites, giving Midland big-city facilities in a
small-town environment.
</P>
<P>
   Among them: the 1,538-seat Midland Center for the Arts, the
Grace A. Dow Memorial Library with 277,000 volumes, a
state-of-the-art tennis complex, and Dow Gardens, a 66-acre plot
that hosts 2,000 varieties of trees, shrubs and flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Midland High School's sports-teams are known as the Chemics. In
1968, Midland opened a new high school and named it _ not
surprisingly _ Herbert H. Dow High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always considered ourselves a Camelot,'' said Ashley
Bromley, a Realtor in Midland. ``I love selling Midland to people.
It's a wonderful place to live.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, the closing of a partially constructed nuclear power
plant in Midland threw more than 5,000 people out of work. ``That
was devastating,'' Bromley said, recalling how property values
bottomed out with a flooded real estate market, and unemployed
workers unable to meet payments came by to drop off their house
keys.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast the Dow Corning bankruptcy filing was hardly a blip
on the economic screen. Still, some in Midland likened it to a
family tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like when you have a friend who's accused of
something, your natural instinct is to be protective and
supportive,'' said Tracy Meister, head of the Dow College
Opportunity Program, which helps guide a select group of low-income
students through the maze of high school and prepare them for
college.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are found guilty, you look at the bigger picture: Is
the offense outweighed by the good the person does in the
community?''
</P>
<P>
   Meister said that prior to the bankruptcy filing, Dow Corning
contributed about $20,000 to the program, spread over five years.
Afterward, Dow Corning ``made it clear to us they wouldn't renew
it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For Dow Corning contractors, the bankruptcy filing and its
aftermath have been an object lesson in hope and persistence.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Beebe, a supplier of commercial gases to Dow Corning and
other customers, wondered how his company could inaugurate its new
$5 million gas production plant located on Dow Corning property.
With two months to go before ribbon cutting, Beebe worried that his
project was dead because of the bankruptcy petition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dow Corning was a very good customer,'' Beebe said. ``There
were not a lot of good alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   When Dow Corning assured him and the entire Midland community
that it intended to stay in business, Beebe decided to tough it
out.
</P>
<P>
   Now, four-and-a-half years after the filing, the gas plant is on
line. Beebe had to sell about $85,000 in unpaid Dow Corning bills
to an investment bank, but his business with the company now is
double what it was prior to the filing.
</P>
<P>
   Beebe's story is typical of Midland _ the economic disaster that
loomed on the horizon never really materialized.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Wood, then a 39-year-old heavy equipment operator at the
sprawling Dow Corning plant, worried about losing his job. He faced
what seemed like the insurmountable difficulty of going somewhere
else after 17 years in the plant, virtually his entire adult
working career.
</P>
<P>
   When the fear of job loss faded, Wood confronted the small
things that go with employment at a company in bankruptcy
proceedings: Paychecks stamped with ``debtor in possession,''
cancellation of company awards for downing the largest buck in
hunting season or catching the largest pike, and his son's sudden
disinterest in taking the high school science classes necessary for
work at Dow Corning.
</P>
<P>
   The psychological damage took its toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had caused these problems, you wouldn't have this
resentment,'' said Wood, a member of the bargaining committee of
United Steel Workers of America Local 12934, which represents 646
blue-collar workers at the Dow Corning plant in Midland. ``But the
scientific evidence shows no connection. So what happens to the
people worried about their paycheck and their future, the people
who went through all the stress we went through?''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone in Midland is a gung-ho Dow Corning supporter.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Roberts, a breast cancer survivor and self-described
``thorn'' on implants since she had her own ruptured set removed in
1995, said she has paid a high price for her outspokenness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I was a woman against the town, against my family,
cousins, uncle who'd worked at Dow Chemical and Dow Corning,'' said
Roberts, 52, an art teacher before extreme pain and cognitive
problems forced her to quit. She blamed her ill health on implants.
</P>
<P>
   When Dow Corning was accused of putting an unsafe, untested
product on the market, some Dow Corning employees scratched their
heads in wonder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us had been around awhile realized these things had
been tested,'' said Gretchen Kohl, a scientific quality specialist
who was an intern in 1974 at the Dow Corning plant. ``The standards
at that plant were very high.''
</P>
<P>
   Others accepted the company's view that its scientists had
tested implants and knew they were safe. But they were frustrated
that people outside Dow Corning did not.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Gosney, a Dow Corning marketing specialist, recalled how
he mentioned his employer in a conversation with a woman sitting
next to him on a long flight from California.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had a friend with implants who was sick so there was no
debate,'' he said. Gosney tried discussing scientific research
suggesting implants were not the cause.
</P>
<P>
   But his seatmate's response was ``don't confuse me with facts,
I've made up my mind,'' he recalled. ``It was a long, cold ride
from then on.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, ``we were as devastated as anybody'' said Dow Corning
senior research scientist Deb Bergstrom. ``Employees began to
wonder if something had gone wrong or if we had done something
inadvertently (wrong).''
</P>
<P>
   When employees learned of the scientific studies that failed to
link implants to disease, ``We were very relieved,'' she said.
``You're talking about a really ethical group of people ... We
would be the last kind of people that would want to be implicated
in that kind of activity.''
</P>
<P>
   But up until that point, employees felt they had been condemned
before all the evidence had been presented.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Midland, there was ``a perception that we were a
nameless, faceless thing with a lot of money,'' said Bergstrom.
``They didn't see us as employees who could get hurt by this.''

AFTER A SEVEN-YEAR BAN, SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS MIGHT RETURN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Nov. 21)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Silicone breast implants _ virtually banned in the
United States since 1992 _ may be back on the market in the next
several years.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Schnur, president of the American Society of Plastic
and Reconstructive Surgeons, said the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, which banned implants in 1995, is rethinking the
issue because recent scientific studies have failed to show a link
between implants and diseases, and because implants today are
better quality than earlier models.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I talk to the FDA, I think they honestly now believe that
these are safe devices,'' said Schnur, the chairman of the plastic
surgery department at the Mayo Clinic's branch in Scottsdale, Ariz.
``Now they say, `All the research has come in, and they look pretty
good.'''
</P>
<P>
   He thinks ``it is a very definite possibility'' that silicone
implants will be back on the market in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Then-FDA Commissioner David Kessler in 1992 ordered that
silicone-filled implants be removed from the market because the
manufacturers had not proven them ``safe and effective.'' Over one
million U.S. women carried the implants at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, two companies _ Mentor Corp. and McGhan Medical
Corp., both of Santa Barbara, Calif. _ make silicone gel implants.
Both firms are pursuing business strategies that assume the FDA
will lift the ban in the not-too-distant future.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Corning, once the largest manufacturer of silicone breast
implants and currently in bankruptcy reorganization, quit the
breast implant business due to the financial strain caused by
19,000 lawsuits brought by women who believe that implants sparked
their ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hazleton, former CEO of Dow Corning, said, ``I can't
conceive of any circumstance where we would'' return to making
breast implants.
</P>
<P>
   David Barella, an executive vice president at McGhan, is
confident that the ban ``eventually'' will be lifted. In fact, the
company is making sales projections showing silicone sales
eventually outpacing sales of saline-filled implants that are
allowed on the market. The reason for the market optimism is
because of silicone's similarity to breast tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, almost 95 percent of the company's implant sales are
for saline implants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we get approval to market the program, we expect a
significant piece of saline (sales) to begin to switch over to
silicone,'' Barella said.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few years of silicone's re-introduction, Barella
projects that sales will tilt to 75 percent silicone and 25 percent
saline implants.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Purkait, Mentor's senior vice president for science and
technology, also said it's likely that the FDA will reverse the ban
in the near future. Purkait said the quality of silicone implants
``is far superior'' to what it was five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Feigal Jr., head of the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration's medical devices branch, said the agency would lift
its ban on the implants when manufacturers can prove that the
devices are ``safe and effective,'' the agency's standard for
allowing them to be marketed.
</P>
<P>
   In FDA-approved studies, the two companies are collecting the
data that they believe will prove the safety of the devices.
</P>
<P>
   This policy suggests that the FDA believes the implants are at
least reasonably safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we thought that these things were never going to go
anywhere and were awful and couldn't be manufactured in a way that
their use would be acceptable, then we would not approve even the
experimental studies,'' said Feigal.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Duhamel, McGhan's vice president for regulatory affairs,
said that by 2002, the firm will have submitted all the required
safety data to FDA, and then the FDA will make a ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Feigal said the FDA likely will ask an independent advisory
panel of scientists and physicians to make a recommendation to the
agency.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA wants the companies to include within the safety data
detailed information about how often the silicone implants rupture.
The information then would enable women to weigh the risks and
benefits of implants and make informed decisions about whether to
have them inserted.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the time when the products can come back on the market
...,'' said Feigal, the FDA's director of the center for devices
and radiological health.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA's position is that even if implants rupture, they
shouldn't necessarily be kept off the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that if we can get accurate information, then it is a
decision for a consumer with her physician,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   When it banned silicone gel implants in 1992, the FDA allowed
the devices to continue to be available for certain women, namely
breast cancer patients seeking reconstructive surgery after
mastectomy operations; women with congenital breast deformities and
women with existing implants that ruptured but who can't have the
other main type of breast prosthetic _ implants filled with saline,
or salt water.
</P>
<P>
   If and when the FDA lifts the ban, the agency also wants the
implants to carry warning labels, much like over-the-counter and
prescription drugs carry warnings of possible side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Those side effects include the possibility that implants could
shift after surgery; scar tissue that forms around the implant
could cause painful hardening in the chest; and implants could
rupture, leaking all or some of the contents into the body.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of products always have some setting in
which they have complications and other settings in which they
perform well,'' said Feigal. ``The issue is how to get the best
description of the complications and the potential complications to
women.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to address the FDA's concerns about rupture, a new
type of silicone is under study at both companies. Called cohesive
silicone, is much more viscous than ordinary silicone with the
consistency of molded jello. Should a rupture occur, cohesive
silicone would tend to stay put rather than leak into the body.

GOVERNMENT'S NEW SILICONE IMPLANT STUDY COMES UNDER FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Nov. 21)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A premier federal research center, the National
Cancer Institute, is under attack for its new study of whether
silicone breast implants can trigger serious diseases in women.
</P>
<P>
   Critics claim the study is biased because of the way women have
been recruited to participate. They also say the study's director,
Dr. Louise Brinton, chief of NCI's environmental epidemiology
branch, may have formed her conclusions before the study even
began.
</P>
<P>
   The quarrel is rare because it erupted even before the study
results have been published.
</P>
<P>
   The NCI, renowned for its impartiality and scientific
horsepower, has denied the charge that the long-awaited, $5 million
assessment of silicone implants is biased.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers and advocates for women with silicone implants who
believe their ailments are caused by the devices have been eagerly
looking forward to the study to prove them right.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 previous studies by institutions like the Harvard
Medical School, the Mayo Clinic, the National Academy of Science's
Institute of Medicine and Britain's Ministry of Health found no
evidence that implants cause cancer or autoimmune diseases such as
arthritis and lupus. However, several studies did find that local
complications, such as painfully hardened breasts and implant
ruptures requiring repeat surgery, can occur.
</P>
<P>
   Critics claim these earlier studies that focused on a link to
disease allegedly involved too few women over too short a period of
time or were biased because some were indirectly funded by implant
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   One critic, Dr. Sidney Wolfe, of the Washington, D.C.-based
Public Citizen Health Research Group, asserts that the NCI study
has the best chance of drawing ``accurate'' conclusions because it
is the largest study to date of women with implants. The medical
histories of 13,500 women who received breast implants before 1988
will be reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Detractors of the NCI study object to its design and the
recruitment of participants. They claim it is biased to show that
implants pose a threat to a woman's long-term health.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most serious charges is that lawyers for implant
plaintiffs and advocacy groups have aided the NCI in getting women
to take part in its study.
</P>
<P>
   That criticism was made by five scientists writing in The
Lancet, a British medical journal. The scientists _ two from the
United States and one each from Mexico, Germany and Canada _
contended in a May 2, 1998, letter to The Lancet that such
recruitment could introduce ``major biases.'' They reason that more
women claiming they were harmed by implants may respond to the
study than women with implants who did not make such claims.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent salvo lobbed at the NCI came in October from Dr.
Marcia Angell, acting editor-in-chief of the New England Journal of
Medicine, a respected medical publication.
</P>
<P>
   Angell, in an interview with the Hearst Newspapers, said letters
written by NCI officials contain ``a lot of talk about the
cooperative effort with plaintiffs' attorneys in designing the
trial, and I thought that was exactly the wrong place to go to
design a study.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 Angell wrote a book, ``Science on Trial,'' which
examined how juries awarded millions of dollars to women who
believed they were injured by silicone implants _ even though
scientific studies had at that point been unable to prove a link
between implants and disease.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Angell said a letter from Brinton explaining
the study to potential participants raised questions of
impartiality.
</P>
<P>
   The letter says ``the study provides an opportunity for women
who may be suffering as a result of implants to be heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Such comments, according to detractors, also appear designed to
attract women who believe their implants caused disease.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the ammunition against the study _ internal letters to
and from NCI officials _ was unearthed through the Freedom of
Information Act by lawyers for former silicone implant
manufacturers. The companies have agreed to a $4.2 billion
settlement with women who believe that implants sparked their
ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Brinton responded to the criticisms by sending a short letter to
The Lancet, denying that the recruitment of subjects for her study
involved plaintiffs' lawyers or advocacy groups. She also said some
of the five scientists' concerns ``reflect their unfamiliarity with
the study as designed ...''
</P>
<P>
   Brinton acknowledged in a separate letter that she met with
about 45 implant plaintiffs' lawyers on two separate occasions in
1995, but said the meetings were proper.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked that the lawyers indicate to their clients that this
was an important study, and one in which they should participate,''
Brinton wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The NCI says it has taken several steps to ensure the study's
objectivity. It said the agency is overseeing the study with the
help of two data-collection companies and that academic scientists
not associated with the agency are providing oversight.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure that women who report ailments have legitimate medical
problems, the NCI said, its investigators validate the cases
through participants' medical records.
</P>
<P>
   The NCI study uses epidemiology _ statistical methods to assess
incidents of disease _ to reach conclusions. The rate of illness
among the 13,500 women is being compared with the rate in a group
of 4,000 other women of similar age who had plastic surgery other
than a breast implant. If the rate of illness for a particular
ailment in the first group is greater than that in the comparison
group, scientists might conclude that implants are associated with
the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Brinton declined to discuss the study until after its findings
are published. The NCI also declined to ask any other NCI scientist
to discuss the controversy.

<P>
   MIDLAND, Mich. _ By any measure, the controversy over silicone
gel breast implants in the early 1990s was a public relations
nightmare for Dow Corning Corp.
</P>
<P>
   News accounts reported that Dow Corning implants could cause
debilitating autoimmune diseases such as lupus and scleroderma. Dow
Corning, the world's largest manufacturer of silicone implants, was
portrayed as indifferent to the safety of its product. Waves of
lawsuits from implant recipients buffeted the company.
</P>
<P>
   At their headquarters here, Dow Corning executives reacted with
stunned anger. They followed their first instinct: Deny the
accusations and depict the company as a victim of an organized
attack by plaintiffs' lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, four years after the company filed for bankruptcy
protection to ward off the lawsuits, Dow Corning executives say
their original stance has been vindicated by new scientific studies
showing no links between implants and autoimmune diseases.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's managers also say that, with the benefit of
hindsight, they would have done some things differently.
</P>
<P>
   The ``lessons learned'' were in two categories: How the company
handled public relations when the controversy first exploded in
late 1990 and early 1991, and Dow Corning's errors in the
development and marketing of implants from the 1960s through the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Barie Carmichael, Dow Corning's chief communications officer,
says company executives were angry and frustrated about the
accusations. When filtered through the media, she said, these
emotions reinforced what she characterized as a false image of a
company that was uncaring and aloof to suffering women.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rylee, the Dow Corning executive designated to deal with
the media, insisted in interviews at the time that the company's
implants were ``safe and effective.'' His assurances often were
contrasted to emotional anecdotal accounts of women who said their
implants had ruined their health.
</P>
<P>
   Rylee also insisted it was up to plastic surgeons to explain the
risks of implants to women patients. ``We don't know who the
patients are,'' he said in interviews at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot, according to Carmichael: ``We looked arrogant.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times on Jan. 29, 1992, compared the company's
handling of the implant controversy to the Exxon Corp.'s response
to the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989 off the coast of Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon was castigated for fumbling the cleanup effort,
downplaying the impact of 240,000 pounds of crude oil in Prince
William Sound, and giving the impression its top executives did not
care about the problems it had caused.
</P>
<P>
   The Times quoted Gerald Meyers, an author and crisis management
expert, as calling Dow Corning's handling of the implant
controversy ``a textbook case of crisis mismanagement.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time well before scientific research backed their claims
that the implants were safe, Dow Corning had inadvertently
increased public sympathy for the women plaintiffs. Each quote in
the media seemed to give their lawyers and anti-implant advocates
more ammo.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when asked in 1991 why Dow Corning had not made its
internal implant studies public, Rylee responded: ``We don't want
to be overeducating plaintiffs' lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyers, who is also a visiting business professor at the
University of Michigan, said in an interview with Hearst Newspapers
last month that Dow Corning was overwhelmed by events.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a small-town company that felt the onslaught and
withering fire of the mass-tort lawyers,'' he said. The company was
``decimated by the strength of the firepower they were facing.''
</P>
<P>
   Things improved somewhat with the 1992 appointment of Dow
Chemical veteran Keith McKennon as Dow Corning's new CEO, according
to Meyers.
</P>
<P>
   McKennon was an ``aw-shucks kind of fellow'' who was more open
and visible, and he pushed the company to appear more sympathetic
to women with implants, Meyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Under McKennon, Dow Corning set up a fund to pay $1,200 to any
woman who wanted her implants taken out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds corny but it's true, you've got to open lines of
communications,'' Meyers said. ``Just because you got sharks
swimming around you doesn't mean you have to get eaten.''
</P>
<P>
   There also were miscues in the development of silicone implants
that no amount of public relations could smooth over.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in the 1960s when Dow Corning first marketed implants,
company scientists conducted over 300 studies of silicone and the
effects of implants on animals. But there was little research done
on the impact of a slow-leaking or ruptured implant on actual
women.
</P>
<P>
   Although Dow Corning still defends its research as valid, ``in
hindsight we could have done a lot more testing,'' said Gary
Anderson, the company's current CEO.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Corning also says it made a mistake in keeping its internal
research away from outside scientists because of fear that
competitors would obtain it and gain commercial advantage, Anderson
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had great confidence in the safety of silicone implants,''
Anderson said. ``But the outside world didn't know that.''
</P>
<P>
   When the attacks came, ``we didn't have independent academics or
government folks or medical people who could stand up and defend
us, and say `Wait a minute, you got this all wrong,''' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the controversy, Dow Corning took steps to show its
concern for women fearful their implants caused disease. But these
efforts either were drowned out by overwhelming negative publicity
or they simply backfired.
</P>
<P>
   A company 800-number hotline for women with implants had to be
overhauled after the Food &AMP; Drug Administration complained that Dow
Corning operators were telling women ``there have never been health
problems with implants or silicone.'' News stories described the
flap.
</P>
<P>
   As a company led by engineers and chemists, Dow Corning had a
difficult time seeing the controversy through the eyes of the
public, particularly women with implants, according to Ian Mitroff,
a business professor at the University of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard for scientific people to understand anything
outside of science,'' Mitroff said. ``One thing they do is mistake
the boxes in their organizational charts as the way the world
thinks. The world doesn't think that way.''
</P>
<P>
   The implant controversy has led to some changes in Dow Corning's
way of doing business. For one, the company has beefed up its force
of ``product stewards'' responsible for checking safety and
investigating product liability. ``It's now on everyone's radar
screen,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Before he departed as Dow Corning CEO earlier this year, board
chairman Richard Hazleton made it clear to employees that they
should use less colorful language in internal reports and
memoranda.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Corning had been stung by release of its own internal
documents.
</P>
<P>
   In one, a marketing executive reported keeping his fingers
``crossed'' while telling plastic surgeons that testing of silicone
seepage from implants was underway.
</P>
<P>
   In another, a salesman called the quality of implants
``questionable.'' The strategy for marketing them, he added, was
``right up there with the Pinto gas tank,'' a reference to the
1970s scandal involving the ill-designed Ford Pinto automobile's
gas tank that exploded on impact.
</P>
<P>
   Hazleton has let executives and scientists know they must watch
what they write. ``I want people to state opinions forcefully, but
not so it's useful (to opponents),'' Hazleton said.

KESSLER DEFENDS HIS BAN OF SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Nov. 21)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dr. David Kessler, the former Food and Drug
Administration commissioner, defends his 1992 decision to ban
silicone breast implants by saying he was justified, given the
state of scientific knowledge at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agency was left with little recourse,'' said Kessler, now
dean of Yale University's medical school.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA was acting on limited scientific data because the
manufacturers of silicone breast implants hadn't proven the devices
were ``safe and effective,'' the FDA standard for allowing medical
devices or drugs on the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, without that data, I think the decision that
was made was the only decision one could reach,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA was being bombarded at the time with complaints from
women who said the implants caused diseases such as arthritis and
lupus. The alleged link to disease was one of the main reasons for
the ban, along with concerns that implants could rupture and cause
other health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Kessler concedes the disease claim now is tenuous, given the
results of more than 20 medical studies from prominent institutions
like the Mayo Clinic, Harvard Medical School and the National
Academy of Science's Institute of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Those studies generally found that while implants can cause
severe localized problems like painfully hardened breasts, there is
no evidence that they cause cancer or autoimmune diseases such as
arthritis and lupus, which occur when the body's immune system
attacks skin and connective tissue.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we know today is that there is no significant risk of
these devices causing systemic disease,'' he said, adding that one
study says there may be a slight increase in risk.
</P>
<P>
   But the as-yet-unknown rate at which silicone implants rupture
was enough justification for the ban, Kessler said in a recent
interview. Studies have shown widely varied rupture rates, with
some models rupturing 5 percent of the time and others more than 51
percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have a hard time saying that something is safe if the
rupture rate is 50 percent. But even 5 percent, if the device kills
you, maybe that's too high,'' Kessler said. ``If the rupture rate
is 5 percent and the only problem is repeat surgery, 5 percent may
be an acceptable risk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not knowing the rupture rate, it's hard to say the product is
safe,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1988, the FDA reclassified breast implants as Class III
medical devices, a step that required manufacturers to demonstrate
that the implants were safe and effective in order to stay on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Kessler asserts that for too long the FDA had a hands-off policy
toward breast implants and medical devices in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not as scientifically sophisticated as we were for
evaluating drugs,'' he said. ``We weren't as rigorous from a
regulatory perspective. Some would characterize it as the agency
was rubber stamping medical devices.''
</P>
<P>
   While Kessler maintains he was performing a public health duty
by banning the devices, various medical and patient organizations _
including the American Cancer Society, the American Society of
Clinical Oncology, the Society of Surgical Oncology and the
National Alliance of Breast Cancer organizations _ accused him in
1996 of creating ``a climate of fear and confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the FDA's ban, some physicians reported that
patients were terrified that they were walking around with ticking
time bombs embedded in their chests. There were reported incidents
of distraught women attempting to remove their implants themselves
with crude surgical tools.
</P>
<P>
   Kessler conceded that the FDA could have done a better job of
calming fears and communicating to women that the ban wasn't a vote
of ``no confidence'' in silicone implants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said that the manufacturers had not demonstrated the safety
of these devices. That is not the same thing as saying they are
unsafe. There's a world of difference between those two things,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kessler's action had stark ramifications in the legal world
where the number of women seeking damages from implant
manufacturers dramatically climbed after the ban was publicized.
The crush of litigation led Dow Corning, then the largest of the
implant makers, to declare bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Kessler's actions still sting Dr. Elizabeth Connell, chairman of
two FDA advisory panels on breast implants and a professor emeritus
in obstetrics at Emory University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was I happy? No. Was I infuriated? Yes,'' she said about
Kessler's ban. ``We felt that implants were basically safe. We said
to leave them on the market. They pose no health threat and they
serve a public health need.''
</P>
<P>
   Connell said the interplay of Kessler's actions and the
avalanche of lawsuits against implant manufacturers have damaged
the greater cause of women's health issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's now very, very difficult to get a company to invest money
in women's health care these days,'' Connell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen 17 companies in the contraceptive field drop to two.
The damage has been done, and I think it's irreversible,'' she
added.

 PLAINTIFF'S LAWYER CONCEDES NEW EVIDENCE UNDERMINES HIS CASE 
</HEADLINE>
 (For release Sunday, Nov. (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Dan Bolton, the first attorney to successfully
sue Dow Corning Corp. over allegations that silicone breast
implants cause autoimmune disease, now says he won't argue with the
recent scientific evidence refuting those claims.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly two dozen scientific studies released since his 1991
landmark case ``are hard to explain away,'' Bolton, 43, conceded in
an interview.
</P>
<P>
   His client, Mariann Hopkins, of Sebastopol, Calif., then
48-years old, won a $7.3-million verdict in U.S. District Court
here after she claimed that breast implants caused her autoimmune
disease. The case received widespread publicity and triggered a
flood of lawsuits against Dow Corning and other breast implant
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, there were no published scientific studies either
way on whether implants caused disease. But Bolton was able to
convince a six-person jury that Hopkins' implants, which she
received after a 1977 mastectomy, resulted in her diagnosis two
years later of mixed connective-tissue disease _ an autoimmune
disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Bolton used expert witnesses who testified that it was more
likely than not that Hopkins' implants, which had ruptured and
leaked silicone, caused her illness. He also focused on internal
Dow Corning memos and animal studies that raised questions about
whether silicone implants were safe enough to be placed in the
body.
</P>
<P>
   Those memos showed that Dow Corning's scientists urged the
company to begin a long-term testing program on silicone implants
in the mid-1970s _ a suggestion that wasn't followed up until 1988
when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requested such
information from all breast implant manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   One expert, Dr. Frank Vasey, the head of rheumatology at the
University of South Florida College of Medicine, testified that it
was possible that Hopkins' implants weren't the primary cause of
her disease but said there was ``certainly no question her clinical
disorder became much worse after the implants.''
</P>
<P>
   He also told jurors that most of his 100 patients who had their
implants removed after being diagnosed with autoimmune diseases and
similar disorders slowly improved over time.
</P>
<P>
   Bolton still criticizes Dow Corning for not giving women more
information about the risks of implants such as the possibility
that painful scar tissue can develop around the implant. And he
points out that internal memos showed Dow Corning was aware as
early as 1975 that some breast implants could rupture and leak but
that women weren't warned of that complication until 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Lappe, now 56, and then a professor of health policy and
ethics at the University of Illinois, also testified for Hopkins,
but he now agrees that implants weren't the primary cause of such
illnesses, despite his previous suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   During Hopkins' trial, Dow Corning attorneys argued that the
company's animal studies showed that implants were safe. Subsequent
independent scientific studies of humans showed no evidence that
the implants were unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   But the lack of those independent tests hurt Dow Corning at the
time. On top of that, Lappe testified that some of Dow Corning's
animal studies showed an immune reaction to silicone. Thus, Lappe
said, it wasn't unreasonable to conclude that silicone breast
implants cause autoimmune disease in humans.
</P>
<P>
   He also told jurors that Dow Corning's tests, including ones
that showed no problems with silicone, were insufficient to prove
the long-term safety of breast implants.
</P>
<P>
   After the Hopkins verdict in December 1991, the Dow Corning
documents were obtained by the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   The following month then-FDA commissioner David Kessler cited
the documents when he ordered a moratorium on the sale of silicone
breast implants. Kessler's decision was based on what he said was
Dow Corning's failure to prove that the implants were ``safe and
effective,'' the standard that the FDA had imposed on the
manufacturers in 1988 and given them 30 months to meet that test.
</P>
<P>
   Partly as a result of the FDA action, the number of lawsuits
against Dow Corning and the other breast implant manufacturers
steadily rose throughout 1992 and 1993. It wasn't until 1994 that
the first independent study, done by the Mayo Clinic, was published
and showed no link between silicone breast implants and disease.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer volume of cases forced Dow Corning to file for
bankruptcy protection in May 1995 _ when the company was facing
nearly 19,000 lawsuits _ even though the scientific evidence was
swinging in the company's favor. The effect was to freeze all of
the pending litigation against the firm.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Arthur J. Spector in Bay City, Mich., is
expected to rule within weeks on whether to accept Dow Corning's
$3.2 billion proposal to settle those lawsuits and emerge from
bankruptcy protection. The company figures that payout is cheaper
than fighting all of the cases in court at a cost of $1 million
each.

<P>
   Here are the key events in Dow Corning Corp.'s legal battle over
silicone gel breast implants:
</P>
<P>
   _ November 1984: Maria Stern of San Francisco becomes the first
plaintiff to win a jury verdict against Dow Corning Corp. after
claiming that silicone-breast implants caused her to suffer
autoimmune diseases. Stern wins $211,000 in compensatory damages
and $1.5 million in punitive damages. The case is appealed but then
settled for an undisclosed amount. As part of the settlement
agreement, internal Dow Corning documents used in trial are sealed
by a court order. The case receives little publicity.
</P>
<P>
   _ December 1991: A California jury awards $7.3 million to
Mariann Hopkins of Sebastopol, Calif., who claimed her Dow Corning
breast implants caused an autoimmune disease. The $7.3 million
verdict is the largest ever against a breast implant manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   _ January 1992: FDA Commissioner David Kessler calls for a
moratorium on the sale of silicone breast implants, citing internal
Dow Corning documents used in the Hopkins' trial that raised
questions about the long-term safety of breast implants.
</P>
<P>
   _ June 1992: About 400 lawsuits filed in federal courts against
silicone breast implant manufacturers are transferred to U.S.
District Judge Sam Pointer in Birmingham, Ala., who will oversee
all federal litigation. At this point several hundred lawsuits are
also pending in state courts.
</P>
<P>
   _ December 1992: Pamela Johnson wins $25 million in Texas state
court against breast implant manufacturer Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.
The increasing size of the jury verdicts prompts breast implant
manufacturers to begin negotiations to settle existing lawsuits and
to limit losses from additional lawsuits. At this point about 2,000
lawsuits have been filed in federal court and state courts.
</P>
<P>
   _ September 1993: Dow Corning, Minnesota Mining &AMP; Manufacturing
Co. (3M), Bristol-Myers and Baxter Healthcare Corp. agree to a
$4.25 billion settlement of all silicone breast implant litigation,
which is rapidly approaching 10,000 suits at the federal and state
levels.
</P>
<P>
   _ March 1994: Dow Corning, the nation's largest breast implant
manufacturer, agrees to pay $2 billion of the $4.25 billion
settlement. By now, an estimated 16,000 lawsuits have been filed in
federal and state courts against the breast implant manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   _ May 1995: Dow Corning files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection in U.S. District Court in Bay City, Mich. This means all
pending 19,000 cases against firm are frozen and transferred to Bay
City. Dow Corning drops out of the global settlement deal because
the company says it can't afford both to pay the $2 billion and to
defend the hundreds of suits from women who are dropping out of the
settlement plan.
</P>
<P>
   _ September 1995: Judge Pointer declares the $4.25 billion
settlement dead because there isn't enough money to pay for the
overwhelming number of claims, now that Dow Corning has dropped out
of the settlement. About 440,000 women with implants registered for
the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   _ October 1995: A Nevada state jury holds Dow Chemical Co. _ one
of Dow Corning's two parents _ liable for medical problems
allegedly linked to breast implants made by Dow Corning and awards
Charlotte Mahlum of Las Vegas $14.2 million. Mahlum sued Dow
Chemical because she was unable to sue Dow Corning because it filed
for bankruptcy protection in May. Later, the Nevada Supreme Court
upholds the verdict but reduces damages to $4.2 million. Dow
Chemical settles the case for an undisclosed amount.
</P>
<P>
   _ November 1995: 3M, Baxter and Bristol-Meyers agree to a new
settlement plan without Dow Corning.
</P>
<P>
   _ December 1996: After studying a report by a panel of impartial
scientists, U.S. District Judge Robert Jones in Portland, Ore.,
rules that lawyers for women suing implant manufacturers cannot
present evidence asserting that implants cause disease because such
a claim would be false. Jones dismisses 70 claims.
</P>
<P>
   _ November 1998: Dow Corning files a plan with the bankruptcy
court to pay $3.2 billion to about 170,000 women who claim they
were injured by its silicone breast implants.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal _ which is still under review by U.S.
District Court Judge Arthur Spector of Bay City, Mich. _ a person
claiming an illness could receive up to $250,000 in compensation
plus $20,000 if the device ruptured as well as $5,000 to pay for
removal.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who hasn't reported any ill effects but who wants to
settle and waive future disease claims would receive $2,000. Women
can opt out of settlement and sue on their own _ a $400 million
legal trust would be established by Dow Corning. Any separate
lawsuits would have to be filed in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   _ December 1998: A panel of four independent scientists
appointed by Judge Pointer _ who is overseeing federal implant
lawsuits against manufacturers other than Dow Corning _ finds there
is no evidence linking silicone implants with any disease. This has
no effect on the more than 100,000 women who are apart of the
settlement because the manufacturers have already agreed to pay
damages.
</P>
<P>
   _ July 1999: Hearings on the Dow Corning bankruptcy settlement
are held. Judge Spector is expected to rule this year on the
proposed breast implant settlement.

<P>
   When then-FDA Commissioner David Kessler banned silicone gel
implants in 1992, there was little scientific research on whether
the devices did or did not cause disease.
</P>
<P>
   The few studies that did exist, usually collections of anecdotal
reports of small groups of fewer than 100 women, cut both ways.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the FDA ban went into effect, results of larger
epidemiological studies _ studies that use statistical methods to
assess incidents of disease _ began to show no link between
implants and serious diseases such as cancer, arthritis and lupus.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some key events in the scientific research on silicone
gel breast implants:
</P>
<P>
   _ December 1993: The Journal of the American Medical Association
publishes a review of existing scientific data, showing no increase
of breast cancer among women with silicone breast implants. The
study also finds insufficient evidence to conclude that implants
are the cause of connective tissue disease.
</P>
<P>
   _ June 1994: A study by the Mayo Clinic finds no increased risk
of connective tissue disorders and other diseases in women studied
with breast implants. Published in the New England Journal of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   _ September 1994: An Australian study of women with implants
finds no link between implants and scleroderma, a connective tissue
disorder. Published in the Australia-New Zealand Journal of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   _ January 1995. A British government assessment of over 200
medical studies finds no link between breast implants and
connective tissue disease. Published by the Medical Devices Agency
of the British Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
   _ June 1995: The Harvard Nurses Health Study concludes there is
no increased risk of connective tissue disease in women with
silicone implants. Published in the New England Journal of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   _ October 1995: The American College of Rheumatology issues a
statement saying that the evidence is ``compelling'' that there is
no link between implants and disease.
</P>
<P>
   _ February 1996: A Harvard Medical School study of 400,000
women, including 11,000 with implants, shows no large increase in
the risk of connective tissue disease reported by women with
implants. The study maintains, however, that there may be a small
risk. Published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   _ December 1996: After studying a report by a panel of
independent scientists, U.S. District Judge Robert Jones in
Portland, Ore., rules that lawyers for women suing implant
manufacturers cannot present evidence asserting that implants cause
disease because such a claim would be false. Jones dismisses 70
claims.
</P>
<P>
   _ January 1997: The American Academy of Neurology reviews
existing silicone implant studies and concludes that ``existing
research shows no link between silicone breast implants and
neurological disorders.''
</P>
<P>
   _ September 1997: The Journal of the National Cancer Institute,
in a review of existing medical studies, concludes that implants do
not cause cancer. The article also concludes that evidence linking
implants with any other disease is ``borderline.''
</P>
<P>
   _ April 1998: Two large Scandinavian studies find ``no support
for the conjecture that breast implants cause neurologic disease.''
Published in the Neurology journal.
</P>
<P>
   _ July 1998: A review by the British Ministry of Health of
existing medical literature concludes that ``the incidence of
ill-health in women implanted with silicone gel breast implants is
no greater than in the general population.''
</P>
<P>
   _ December 1998: Four independent scientists appointed by U.S.
District Court Judge Sam Pointer of the Northern District of
Alabama _ who is overseeing federal implant lawsuits against
manufacturers other than Dow Corning _ finds there is no evidence
linking silicone implants with disease. This has no effect on the
more than 100,000 women who are part of the settlement because the
manufacturers have already agreed to pay damages.
</P>
<P>
   _ June 1999: The National Academy of Science's Institute of
Medicine releases a 400-page study prepared by 13 scientists who
conclude that implants do not cause major diseases, although they
can cause serious local complications such as painful hardening of
the breasts. The findings were based on a nearly two-year review of
existing scientific literature.
</P>
<P>
   _ 1999: Scientists and breast implant manufacturers eagerly
await the findings of the largest study to date of women with
silicone implants. This study, by the National Cancer Institute, is
under attack by implant makers and some scientists as biased toward
showing a link between implants and disease. The NCI denies any
bias.

   The 1992 ban on silicone gel breast implants by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration climaxed the gradual expansion of FDA
regulation of the devices. Following are the key events in that
evolution:
</P>
<P>
   _ 1962: Silicone breast implants were first used in
reconstructive surgery following breast surgery. Cosmetic use grows
in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   _ May 1976: Congress gives the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
responsibility for assuring that medical devices are ``safe and
effective.'' But because silicone breast implants had been on the
market for nearly 15 years, the FDA ``grandfathers'' implants,
exempting them from the ``safe and effective'' requirement.
</P>
<P>
   _ July 1976: The FDA's advisory panel on surgical devices
recommends that breast implants be classified as Class II medical
devices. Class I and II cover medical devices with well-established
safety records.
</P>
<P>
   _ January 1982: Prompted in part by anecdotal reports in medical
journals and news stories about illnesses caused by implants, the
FDA proposes that breast implants be reclassified from Class II
medical products to Class III. The new classification would require
manufacturers to demonstrate that the implants are ``safe and
effective'' in order to keep them on the market.
</P>
<P>
   _ November 1984: For the first time, a woman successfully sues
Dow Corning Corp. after claiming that her silicone implants caused
her autoimmune disease. The plaintiff, Maria Stern of San
Francisco, wins a jury verdict of $1.7 million against Dow Corning.
</P>
<P>
   _ June 1988: Six years after proposing the change, the FDA
reclassifies breast implants as Class III medical devices. The FDA
directs the manufacturers to come forward with proof by July 1991
that implants are ``safe and effective.''
</P>
<P>
   _ November 1988: The Public Citizen Health Research Group, which
is associated with Ralph Nader, charges that Dow Corning has
evidence silicone gel implants cause cancer in laboratory animals
and pose a threat to women. The group, basing its charge on
documents from Dow Corning and the FDA, calls for banning the
implants.
</P>
<P>
   _ November 1991: The FDA's plastic surgery advisory panel
examines the scientific data from breast implant manufacturers,
including Dow Corning, and concludes that the information doesn't
prove the devices are either safe or harmful. The panel asks
manufacturers to submit more data. In the interim, the panel
decides that the implants fulfill a public health need and allows
the implants to remain on the market while the companies collect
additional scientific data.
</P>
<P>
   _ February 1992: FDA's plastic surgery panel reviews new
scientific data on implants and concludes that there is no causal
link between implants and autoimmune diseases.
</P>
<P>
   _ April 1992: Facing pressure from patient groups, members of
Congress and newly uncovered Dow Corning documents showing quality
control problems, FDA commissioner David Kessler bans implants
because the manufacturers have not proven them to be ``safe and
effective.'' However, the agency allows implants to continue to be
used for reconstructive surgery if the recipients agree to
participate in medical studies.
</P>
<P>
   _ September 1996: The Y-Me National Breast Cancer Organization
asks the FDA to ease restrictions on availability of silicone
implants.
</P>
<P>
   _ February 1997: A group of women with breast implants who have
serious health problems asks the FDA to ban all implants, including
those used for reconstructive surgery.
</P>
<P>
   _ Present: Two companies _ Mentor Corp. and McGhan Medical
Corp., both of Santa Barbara, Calif. _ are manufacturing silicone
implants for use in the FDA-approved medical studies. The companies
plan to submit their scientific data to the FDA in an effort to
persuade the FDA that the devices are ``safe and effective.''

   ST. CROIX, U.S. Virgin Islands _ Plans by a Texas entrepreneur
to assemble huge rockets here and launch commercial satellites from
a nearby island have set off fireworks on this laid-back vacation
paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas banker Andrew Beal's high-flying plans were stuck on the
ground this week in a Virgin Islands territorial court, where
opponents argued against a controversial land swap between Beal and
the Virgin Islands government.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say the site Beal wants for his headquarters and
rocket assembly plant is rich in pre-Colombian ruins, and fronts an
environmentally sensitive bay and offshore coral reef.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our environment is critical to our economic future,'' said
attorney Ned Jacobs, who represents 20 islanders opposed to the
land deal that was approved last month by the islands' government.
``Beal wants to turn an area of great cultural and natural resource
value into an industrial setting, and people think that's a
horrible idea.''
</P>
<P>
   A judge has already temporarily blocked the deal, and is
expected to rule soon on a permanent injunction. Wade Gates, a
spokesman for Beal Aerospace Technologies, said the company would
appeal any adverse court rulings. He also defended the plans for
the site in question.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't destroy anything,'' he said. ``We would actually
preserve what's there, clean it up and provide improvements. After
we build our headquarters, people would still have access to the
beach.''
</P>
<P>
   Beal also faces opposition from environmentalists on Anguilla, a
British territory that owns tiny Sombrero Island, where he hopes to
build his launch pad.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, he must convince potential customers _ largely
satellite telecommunications companies _ that a start-up company
can compete in the risky, expensive launch business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people in the industry feel Beal still has a lot to
prove,'' said Craig Covault, senior editor of Aviation Week and
Space Technology. ``As a start-up, they're very impressive in their
engineering team and approach, but whether they can overcome the
technical and cost challenges remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The rocket plant would bring an economic boost to the troubled
U.S. Virgin Islands, where the tourism-dependent economy is mired
in the doldrums and the government has wracked up a $1 billion
debt. Beal says he would bring 150 permanent jobs to the island of
55,000, with a $75 million initial investment.
</P>
<P>
   On tiny Anguilla, with a population of barely 12,000, the 200
full-time jobs would also be a boost.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very small financial base and any type of
diversification is favorable,'' said Hubert Hughes, chief minister
of Anguilla. ``It would be stable, prolonged employment. Right now
we have only a fragile, one-crop industry called tourism.''
</P>
<P>
   Beal is already developing his rocket, designing the engines at
a facility in Frisco, which employs about 200 people north of
Dallas, and test-firing at an old military base near Waco.
</P>
<P>
   With his background in real estate and banking, Beal seems an
unlikely rocket man. But he's reportedly something of a math
genius, and has offered a $50,000 prize to anyone who can solve a
complex problem he wrote. So far, nobody has solved ``Beal's
Conjecture.''
</P>
<P>
   He began his foray into the space business four years ago,
attracted by the boom in satellite communications and a backlog in
launch schedules.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to keep it as simple as possible, with few moving
parts, so that it is reliable and inexpensive,'' Gates said of the
proposed booster.
</P>
<P>
   Beal chose the Caribbean for his launch site because it is near
the equator, where rockets can reach orbit with less fuel because
the earth's rotation helps catapult them into space. He was
attracted to the U.S. Virgin Islands because of tax incentives, and
because laws governing the space business strictly limit what types
of technologies are allowed off U.S. soil.
</P>
<P>
   While Beal has approvals for the facilities from both island
governments, he must still win approvals from both the British and
U.S. governments before he can proceed. As a back up, Beal has been
negotiating with Guyana on the South American coast for the launch
facility.
</P>
<P>
   At 236 feet tall and with a payload capacity of 40,000 pounds,
Beal's rocket would be one of the biggest in an increasingly
crowded field. Since NASA scaled back commercial satellite launches
following the Challenger disaster in 1986, private launch companies
have sprung up in Europe, Russia, Japan, China and India.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention Boeing and Lockheed-Martin, the two U.S.
companies already launching commercial payloads from Cape Canaveral
in Florida and Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very big business worldwide with lots of competition,''
said Covault. ``I think Beal is very serious and is aware of the
challenges, but there are a lot of hurdles to overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   In the islands, Beal has plenty of support among top government
officials and business leaders. But his opponents are determined
and vocal.
</P>
<P>
   On Anguilla, local preservationists and the Royal Society for
the Protection of Birds _ which boasts Queen Elizabeth among its
patrons _ say the launch pad would harm birds and lizards on the
tiny island. The only person living on Sombrero _ 38 miles from
Anguilla _ is a lighthouse keeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sombrero is one of the more important sites in all of the
Caribbean for nesting seabirds,'' said the Royal Society's Jim
Stevenson. ``So many other islands have been built over that it
makes an island like this all that much more important.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates said the company has conducted extensive environmental
studies on Sombrero, and believes the impact would be minimal. The
launch pad would use only about 10 percent of the island's 95
acres, and the company would help create nature preserves on other
nearby islands, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On St. Croix, opponents have circulated petitions and held
marches. The issue has dominated the local press, with radio talk
shows buzzing over the latest developments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think part of the problem is that some people feel Beal is
arrogant and condescending,'' said talk show host Maria Heywood.
``People here are politically astute. They feel that giving away
this property for a few jobs isn't a fair trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Jacobs said his group would drop their opposition if
Beal agrees to move to an existing industrial park.
</P>
<P>
   But Gates said the company feels it would just face new
opposition if it agreed to move.
</P>
<P>
   ``These debates about progress and preservation were going on
long before Beal arrived,'' he said. ``We're offering the kinds of
jobs and investment that will allow these people's children to stay
on the islands. Unfortunately, you have a small number of people
who appear to oppose almost anything.''

 &HT;    A DWINDLING MINORITY: IRANIAN JEWS UNNERVED BY ARRESTS
 &HT;    With Photo.
 &HT;    For Use Sun., Nov. 14 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ The Jews of Iran are one step closer to leaving
their homeland of more than 2,500 years.
</P>
<P>
   They were stunned in March, when Iranian police in the southern
city of Shiraz arrested 13 Jews and seven Muslims. Police accused
them of spying for the United States and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Those jailed include a 16-year-old boy, four religious school
teachers and a lay leader who performs Jewish ritual circumcisions.
</P>
<P>
   Accustomed to cautious but prosperous lives, Iranian Jews now
wonder if the rules have changed. Many consider joining relatives
in North America, Europe or Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every Jew in Iran has a plan. They just don't know when,''
said one member of the Jewish community in Tehran recently. He
asked, as most do now, not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   But, a daughter of one of those arrested wrote a poem in August
in an Iranian Jewish magazine pleading for help from the Islamic
country's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. In it, she
described the dilemma for Iranian Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, who have devoted our lives to Iran, could we leave this
country, take our hearts away from it?'' wrote Sahar Puyan Rad, a
high school student. ``We've been planted here. Iran is our garden
. . . but our days are now filled with sorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Though we are two religions, still we've got one heart, one
God, one homeland then therefore one leader,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Iranian Jews regularly pray for Khamenei and other
Iranian leaders. It is one of the ways through the centuries that
they have woven Persia, now Iran, into their religion.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the country's 50 synagogues are decorated in Persian
carpets. Worshippers remove their shoes before praying _ as do
their Muslim countrymen. The city of Hamadan is home to the
5th-Century tomb of Jewish Queen Esther.
</P>
<P>
   Jews here weathered the birth of Israel, which saw the expulsion
of Jews from many Muslim countries. They survived the radicalism of
the 1979 Islamic Revolution, though more than half of them fled.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Turkey, Iran remains the only Middle
Eastern Muslim country with a sizable Jewish population _ numbering
about 30,000 in a country of about 65 million.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the Jewish community here, mindful of maintaining
good relations with Iranian officials, assert that anti-Semitism is
no worse in Iran than in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   However, one acknowledges that the Shiraz arrests in March may
push emigration this year to about 900 from some 600 in previous
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe a crisis has occurred in the Jewish community.
But it will calm down,'' says Haroun Yashayaei, leader of the
Tehran Jewish Association and a prominent Iranian film producer.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed, he acknowledges the arrests caused a ``little
panic.'' But he blames that on foreign media and diplomats he
claims want to stir up anti-Iranian feelings.
</P>
<P>
   There has been an outcry. Joined by Jewish groups throughout the
world, diplomats from the United States to Israel to Russia have
expressed concern about the arrests.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, at the request of American Jewish
leaders, has said that he may visit Iran to win the Jews' release.
</P>
<P>
   They all search for delicate ways of pressuring a country that
is anti-Israel, stridently independent and undergoing its own
struggle over calls for democratic reform.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders worry that a hard-line faction in the government had
the Jews arrested in order to generate anti-Western sentiment
within Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are particularly concerned that these members of the Jewish
minority may have been singled out for persecution to make a
political point, as a gambit in what is widely described as a
struggle within Iran's leadership, rather than to serve justice,''
wrote Human Rights Watch in a letter to the head of the Iranian
judiciary in September.
</P>
<P>
   Concern peaked months ago, when a high-ranking Iranian court
official promised executions for those arrested. The judge later
lost his job _ though it is unclear why _ and reform-oriented
President Mohammad Khatami has promised fair trials.
</P>
<P>
   However, Khatami does not control the courts and is second in
power behind Iran's Supreme Leader Khamenei. It appears that the
trials may be held in secret Revolutionary Courts.
</P>
<P>
   There are differing reports as to whether the defendants have
been able to meet with lawyers. Family members say that, as
Orthodox Jews, they have refused to eat non-Kosher jail food,
limiting themselves to bread and water.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about the reason for the arrests is rampant within
Iran's Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
   One story is that they found the Jews with Hebrew videotapes
about religious themes and mistook them for something sinister.
Another theory is that some members of the group may have been
caught sending e-mails or letters to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   And, some speculate that other Jews may have been trying to
settle a score in some internal dispute by alleging crimes to the
police.
</P>
<P>
   The facts are disconcertingly sketchy.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knows about the case. Because of that, we are
worried,'' said Parves Ahobim, 52, a Jewish merchant in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   But some of those arrested are well-known leaders within the
Jewish community. Said a Tehran Jew, asking not to be identified:
``We don't know about the case, but we know they are not spies.''
</P>
<P>
   Jews have always been quick to point out that Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic revolution, stated that Jews
and Christians should be allowed to live peacefully in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish community publishes a booklet of Khomeini's sayings
about the Jews. When a celebration was held this summer to mark
what would have been his 100th birthday, 27 buses of Jews showed
up.
</P>
<P>
   Some say the Shiraz case prompted the huge attendance as a show
of loyalty to Iran and solidarity within the Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
   Under Khomeini's dictate, Jews in Iran were given a seat in
parliament, as were a few Christian denominations.
</P>
<P>
   But, minority religions have run into problems under the Islamic
regime. The Bahai's, practitioners of an offshoot of Islam, have
been especially persecuted with arrests and hundreds have been
executed.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Associated Press, 17 Jews have been executed in
the last 20 years. But, human rights groups in most cases have been
unable to determine if the past arrests were based on religious
persecution.
</P>
<P>
   Muslims get lighter sentences for crimes against against
non-Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   But, Jews have some small liberties. They are allowed to drink
alcohol while Muslims, at least in theory, are not. Men and women
can mix at their weddings, while they are not supposed to in Muslim
weddings.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as Jews trade scant information about the 13 of their faith
in jail, those allowances are overshadowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have taken away some of us and hurt our hearts by doing
this. The backs of the women have been bowed because their husbands
are gone,'' high school poet Rad writes. ``The soil of Iran is part
of our lives and we do our best for Iran.''

 &HT;    There is nothing worse than a politician who's found a 'crisis'
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHALL, Texas _ I missed my chances to see debates among the
Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   I would have been parked right in front of my television, but
I've always had something else to attend, the outcome of which was
far, far more important to the future of our country _ Marshall
High School football games.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks had a losing season and I was, truth to tell,
depressed about the whole matter, but not nearly as depressed as I
would have been watching Republicans savage themselves.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, I'll probably have something more important to
do every single time C-SPAN replays the debates, about 400 times or
so I would imagine. I'll just have to miss hearing the GOP
candidates talk about what a terrible, horrible, rotten place
America is today.
</P>
<P>
   Really? Is America really so bad? Is this a crisis? Is this what
our parents faced in going through the Great Depression, or as they
struggled through the fighting of the Second World War?
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, I wonder if times are as bad as they were
during the great social upheavals of the '60s and '70s. I was
pretty young during those days, but it seemed like the United
States was going through a much rougher time then than now.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is no crisis, other than the personal one each
of these candidates face in realizing they don't have a dog's
chance against Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In politics, the worst crisis of all comes when the candidate
realizes he is probably going to lose. Then the sky can't fall fast
enough. Descriptions of all sorts of ills _ almost entirely
imaginary or overblown _ slip from the mouths of likely losers.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, when Ronald Reagan was running for re-election, a
group of Democratic candidates got together for a debate at about
this same time during the election. I didn't watch that one,
either. I think my car needed to be washed.
</P>
<P>
   You may recall, as I do, that those were mostly good days in the
United States _ not perfect, but pretty good. But to hear the
Democrats, Dante's hell would have been a more pleasant place to
be.
</P>
<P>
   One of the candidates said it was ``midnight in America.''
Really? No, of course not, but it was midnight in his campaign.
Reagan won in a walk.
</P>
<P>
   I'm no fan of Bill Clinton's, but let's be realistic for a
moment. Take Monica Lewinsky and sex out of the Oval Office
(please) and would America really be much of a different place had
Bob Dole won the last election? The honest answer is ``no.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm tired of hearing candidates of any ilk make up crises that
don't exist. To do so tarnishes the accomplishments of the
generations of Americans who've suffered through _ and conquered _
real crises. Most of us living today and most of the candidates
(John McCain excepted) don't even know what a real crisis is.
</P>
<P>
   But we may someday all have to face something like a world war,
where it isn't immediately clear who is going to be the winner. We
may face an economic crisis where people are starving in our own
country. It is hard to believe it may happen, but our own fathers
and grandfathers experienced it. We aren't so far removed.
</P>
<P>
   If that time comes, it won't have been helpful that we pretended
our role in the United Nations was a ``crisis.'' Or
most-favored-nation trade status for China was a ``crisis.'' Or
even that sex in the White House was a ``crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Every problem and difficulty is not a crisis. When our
politicians try to tell us so, it is time to turn them off, get
outside and enjoy our nation not in crisis. You might even consider
a high school football game.

 &HT;    The gift is thanks to UD
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ When I heard about the largest-ever gift in
University of Dayton history, the number simply staggered me.
</P>
<P>
   No, not the $10 million pledge, $2 million a year over five
years.
</P>
<P>
   It was that class of '78 number that stunned me. My class.
</P>
<P>
   John McHale is 43 years old. My age.
</P>
<P>
   I graduated from Miami University in 1978, and I still can't
figure out the high finances of my son's Cub Scout popcorn sales.
What business does McHale have, a kid like us, with so much spare
cash to donate to his alma mater?
</P>
<P>
   At times, the Internet entrepreneur can't believe it either. He
vividly remembers living in UD's Ghetto, not so long ago, and
selling his plasma once a week for $10. ``A Milano's cheesesteak
sandwich figured in that equation, and maybe a six-pack of Little
Kings,'' he recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Aren't benefactors of this magnitude supposed to be dead? Or, at
the very least, venerable? I didn't detect a fleck of silver in the
photo of McHale standing next to a beaming Brother Raymond Fitz,
UD's president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of my good fortunes,'' McHale says, ``that I can do
this while I'm younger, and live long enough to see the effects.''
His wife, Chris, told a UD interviewer, ``You don't forget who
brung you to the dance.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how many times you've told yourself that you don't
equate money with success, it's hard for those of us still playing
stagger-the-bills not to feel like a loser, a loser with a capital
L, when faced with stories like McHale's. Where is this magical
land called Adulthood, my friends and I ask ourselves, where you
don't have to fret about paying the mortgage and the car payment in
the same week?
</P>
<P>
   Talking with the modest, normal-guy McHale is an excellent
antidote to such feelings of inadequacy.
</P>
<P>
   As an undergrad, McHale shared a house in the Ghetto with five
other guys, and they had a system for dishwashing: Each roommate
was assigned a day, and if he didn't do the dishes that day, he'd
get stuck with the next day's, too. ``This one guy didn't do the
dishes for 10 days, and finally we ran out of dishes and put them
all in his bed.''
</P>
<P>
   His first year out of college, working for Texas Instruments in
Dallas, McHale became ``UD-sick,'' flying back to Dayton every few
weeks to visit friends still in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have friends in Texas who have that kind of devotion to a
team,'' he reflects, ``but don't have that broad passion for the
university.''
</P>
<P>
   The struggle, the territorial initialing of cartons of eggs and
gallons of milk, all factored into the fun of those days, McHale
says. Those struggles are long gone for the man who sold two
computer companies, NetWorth and NetSpeed, for a total of $600
million. But he has never distanced himself from UD, or from
ordinary life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how great it feels to finally have my student
loan paid off,'' he joked at the 1997 groundbreaking for what was
initially called the McHale Basketball Center. At McHale's
insistence, it was renamed to honor legendary UD coach Don Donoher.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't live in a 50,000-square-foot pleasure palace, a la
Bill Gates: ``You can only be so comfortable in life. You can
isolate yourself from your family and from society if you build
your physical wealth around you.
</P>
<P>
   Having three children under the age of 6 keeps him grounded,
McHale says: ``I know it's easy for me to say this, but making
money is such a small piece of the the life struggle. I'd call it a
5 percenter, definitely not a 100 percenter.''
</P>
<P>
   So how does he define success, if not in terms of wealth?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll point to an example,'' he says. ``Brother Ray. I would
define success as rising to the top of one's field with grace and
humility.''
</P>
<P>
   We might expand that definition to include those who give back
in the same spirit.

 &HT;    `So frightful an endeavor'
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jim Minter writes about his visit to the D-Day invasion beaches
in France. Following is the first of two columns.
</P>
<P>
   Omaha Beach, the bloodiest of the invasion sites, and the big
American cemetery in Normandy are places the president, the Cabinet
and every member of the Congress ought to be required to see in
person before taking office. They are powerful reminders of what
Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower said when he came here years after he had
led the greatest military operation in history: Never again must
nations have to call on their young men for so frightful an
endeavor.
</P>
<P>
   To someone who has only teen-age memories of June 6, 1944, the
Normandy coast of France at the end of this century seems almost
like home. The beaches, today as tranquil as St. Simons or Sapelo
on the Georgia coast, were so dearly repurchased from Hitler's Nazi
occupants that you have a feeling of being on American soil.
</P>
<P>
   Old soldiers from this country, from Great Britain and Canada,
some wearing ancient and bemedaled tunics, are common sights as
they stroll beaches and villages where they fought half a century
ago. No great imagination is needed to hear thunder of guns and
cries of wounded, to see golden sand stained red, beaches littered
with young soldiers who would never go home again to all we have
enjoyed in these 50-plus years since that awful day.
</P>
<P>
   They bought it for us, the unlucky ones who died and the lucky
ones who lived. Nowhere is our debt more obvious than the American
cemeteries with their endless ranks of white crosses and Stars of
David spread across acres as vast as a South Georgia cotton field.
No words or pictures can describe these scenes. They must be seen
with the eye, and yet there is no way to truly understand, except
for those who were there.
</P>
<P>
   Their flags still fly over Normandy, the Stars and Stripes most
prominently. Unlike other parts of France, the people speak
English, and gladly so. Museums dedicated to liberation tell a
story that much of America has forgotten, or never really knew. In
village squares, and on bluffs overlooking the sea, you see
well-preserved jeeps, Sherman tanks and artillery pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Remains of man-made ``Mulberry'' harbors, manufactured in
England and towed across the Channel, shelter fishermen at
Arromanches. The artificial harbors, needed for unloading ships and
supplies on the beaches, were the second largest and most expensive
industrial endeavor of World War II, exceeded only by the Manhattan
Project that produced the atom bomb.
</P>
<P>
   LEADING THE WAY OFF UTAH BEACH
</P>
<P>
   Utah Beach, westernmost of the invasion points, was not so
heavily defended as Omaha, but bloody still. Men spearheading the
4th Division's assault were pinned almost in the surf by German
machine guns and cannons firing from concrete bunkers embedded on
bluffs until Brig. Gen. Theodore Roosevelt Jr., son of Teddy and
too old for combat, picked up his walking cane, stepped out front,
and headed into the hedgerows.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things you see on a visit to Utah Beach is a
copy of The Atlanta Journal, dated June 6, 1944. The yellowed front
page has the same headlines and typefaces I worked with so many
years in the sports department, describing bloodless battles
between Georgia and Georgia Tech, Alabama and Auburn. The next
thing you noticed is a baseball bat from the old Hanna factory in
Athens. An unidentified soldier from Athens had carried it across
the Atlantic, and then across the English Channel to France. For a
visitor from Georgia, D-Day comes closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   As spring edged toward summer, everyone knew it was coming. What
they didn't know was when, or where. Hitler and his generals in
their map room were about as much in the dark as my young cousins
and I chopping cotton in Fayette County. No landing of the
magnitude required had ever been attempted, and certainly not
against such massive fortifications as the Germans had built into
their ``Atlantic Wall'' along the French coastline. If a Las Vegas
bookie had been making odds, the outcome of the invasion would have
been ``too close to call.''
</P>
<P>
   AFTERNOON PAPER GOT STORY
</P>
<P>
   Looking at a copy of a newspaper that had hit the streets in
Atlanta only hours after the first waves hit the beaches, I thought
about what it must have been like that morning in the Journal
offices on Forsyth Street. I knew the afternoon Journal had enjoyed
what we used to call a ``P.M. Break'' on the biggest story of the
war.
</P>
<P>
   The Allied invasion forces, preceded by parachutists jumping
behind German lines just after midnight, hit the beaches at dawn.
Breakfast in Normandy is still midnight in Atlanta. Surely the
morning Atlanta Constitution, a rival Journal people in those days
regarded only slightly below Germany and Japan, had been shut out.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Journal's ``Weather Ear'' in the top left-hand
corner of the front page, Atlanta on June 6 expected a high of 79
and a low of 68, with cooler weather on the way. The paper
``Covered Dixie Like the Dew'' and sold for 5 cents a copy.
</P>
<P>
   The lead headline, eight columns of thick, black, capital
letters, more than an inch high and hand-set from ancient wooden
type, announced the long-awaited invasion: ALLIES STORM COAST
LINES. Wes Gallagher's Associated Press story under the headline,
filed from Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Expeditionary Force
in London, reported fighting in the inland city of Caen. German
defenses on the beaches were said to be lighter than expected.
</P>
<P>
   That turned out to be terribly optimistic. Caen did not fall to
English Gen. Bernard Montgomery until many days later, but
Gallagher, who later became chief of the Associated Press, could
report only what he was told by Army press officers. No reporter
had an eyewitness account to send home. Before the morning was out,
one would.
</P>
<P>
   Next week: Atlanta Journal editor Wright Bryan's eyewitness
report of Allied landings is arguably the ``scoop'' of the century.

   ATLANTA _ ``I would like your advice on which tool to buy
next,'' a reader says. ``I plan to do built-in bookshelves and
cabinets (a huge job for me and nothing like I've done before). I
have the usual hand power tools (but no orbital sander), a 10''
table saw (so-so) and a 12'' DeWalt compound mitre saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like I'll have to build up some panels from hardwood
(maple or alder) and am thinking the jointer will be the next power
tool to buy. I can spend in the $400-$500 range. I look forward to
your advice.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, sir, however much you may have been looking forward to it,
I'm not sure you're going to like it. The e-mail doesn't contain as
much information as I'd like, such as exactly what kind of panels
we're talking about and how big they're going to be, and what you
mean by ``build up.''
</P>
<P>
   You don't have enough money to buy a really useful jointer. You
might be able to find a decent 6-inch jointer for $500 but this
won't do you any good except for edge jointing, and you can handle
that well enough with a Record bench jointer.
</P>
<P>
   Much as I hate to say it, I would suggest you consider plywood,
at least for your bookcases. If your 10-inch bench saw is only
so-so, then invest in a good portable circular saw, put a carbide
blade on it, and get an eight-foot straightedge for cutting plywood
(they're not expensive, but be sure to use a brace in the middle if
you're cutting in the 8-foot direction) and a set of sawhorses.
This will allow you to slice up the plywood panels more safely, and
possibly more accurately, than with a lightweight table saw.
</P>
<P>
   You can use veneer tape to edge the work, or if you want to do a
really nice job, edge it in hardwood. Buy enough matching 4/4
hardwood to do the job, joint one edge with the Record plane, and
rip it on the table saw into one-inch strips for the edging, which
only needs to be glued to the plywood.
</P>
<P>
   The cabinets are another matter. I don't know what kind of
cabinets you have in mind. Plywood is always used for the carcass
of kitchen cabinets. If you have frame-and-panel doors in mind,
hardwood is most often used for the frames, and can easily be used
for the panels, too, if you wish. If you plan on flat, frameless
doors, then plywood is essential to avoid the warping likely with
that much solid wood. I'd definitely use hardwood edging in this
case. Same goes for drawers.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to use frame-and-panel doors and drawer fronts, I'd
still use the hand plane for jointing. My advice would be to save
your money until you can buy at least an eight-inch jointer and a
portable 10-inch planer, or better yet, a European combo
jointer-and-planer with a 10-inch or larger capacity.

PERSONAL HEALTH: DRUGS, SAFE AND NOT SO SAFE, IN PREGNANCY 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (First of 2 articles on staying healthy and fit through pregnancy) 
 (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The thalidomide tragedy of the 1960s touched off intense concern
and a vast amount of research about the safety of drugs taken
during pregnancy. Many drugs (and druglike substances, including
coffee, alcohol and tobacco) were tested in laboratory animals or
studied in pregnant women. Some were found to be potential hazards
to developing fetuses, usually only at the beginning of pregnancy
but in some cases only near the time of birth and in others
throughout gestation.
</P>
<P>
   Now most pregnant women are cautioned to avoid any and all
medications that are not absolutely essential, as well as
``pleasure drugs'' like alcohol and tobacco and sometimes coffee
and caffeine. But while this is sound advice in general, it can
often result in needless discomfort for women who avoid taking a
harmless drug that could help them. It also causes undue anxiety
among those women who must take medication or who inadvertently
took one or more drugs before they knew they were pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1968, for example, I got the Hong Kong flu the day I
was expecting the start of menses. Frequent doses of aspirin kept
me from burning up, but 10 days later I remained seriously ill and
still had not gotten my period. Now I was coughing so hard I
cracked a rib. This time the diagnosis was double pneumonia, for
which antibiotics and codeine cough medicine were prescribed. Two
weeks later, my gynecologist informed me that I was pregnant. When
I asked the doctor about the harm that might have been done by the
drugs I had taken, he replied reassuringly, ``If you had not taken
them and had died of pneumonia, you would not be having any baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, I spent the next eight months fretting about the harm
that might have resulted to my unborn child. But by what seemed at
the time to be a miracle, 36 weeks after contracting the flu I gave
birth to perfectly healthy, full-term identical twin boys.
</P>
<P>
   I have since learned that it is reasonably safe for pregnant
women to take a number of drugs in common use, though they should
consult their doctors before taking any drug. Even some vaccines,
including the flu vaccine, are safe to administer to pregnant
women. Furthermore, most medications pose no hazard to a nursing
infant because the amount that gets into breast milk is usually too
small to have a noticeable effect on the baby.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with a general recommendation from Dr. Jennifer R.
Niebyl, head of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Iowa
College of Medicine, who says, ``Pregnant women should be
discouraged from using over-the-counter drugs for trivial
indications.'' Thus, a common cold is best treated with rest,
fluids, a humidifier and, if needed, a saltwater (saline) nasal
spray like Ocean. Topical medications, like a decongestant nasal
spray, are safer than oral ones, and if any cold remedy is used,
combination drugs are best avoided. Cough remedies containing
iodide should be avoided because they may cause a large goiter in
an unborn child.
</P>
<P>
   For aches and pains, try local applications of heat and rest.
But if, say, you have a headache you can't shake and it's
interfering with your life, acetaminophen (like Tylenol) is safer
than aspirin near the end of pregnancy because it does not prolong
bleeding and is not toxic to newborns.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce the risk of vaginal yeast infections, a common problem
among pregnant women, antibiotics should be used only when needed
to control a known bacterial infection. Safe antibiotics include
penicillin and its derivatives, erythromycin and the
cephalosporins. On the other hand, sulfonamides are best avoided in
the third trimester, and tetracyclines, which cause discoloration
of babies' teeth, should not be used beyond 25 weeks of gestation.
</P>
<P>
   The drug metronidazole, commonly used to treat intestinal
parasites, is best avoided in the first trimester. Lindane (as in
Kwell), formerly widely used to treat lice infestations, should be
avoided entirely during pregnancy, and pregnant women should wear
rubber gloves when treating children for head lice; safer
alternatives are the pyrethroids with piperonyl butoxide (Rid and
R&AMP;C, for example) or a fine-toothed comb.
</P>
<P>
   The new nonsedating antihistamines used to treat allergies have
not been tested for safety in pregnancy. But women who have been
receiving desensitization shots can continue to do so at a
maintenance dose during pregnancy. Women with asthma can safely use
theophylline, aminophylline, terbutaline and cromolyn sodium. And
it may surprise you to learn that the potent immune-suppressing
drugs prednisone and prednisolone are considered drugs of choice
during pregnancy because they are nearly completely inactivated by
the placenta.
</P>
<P>
   Also safe are alphamethyldopa and propranolol to treat chronic
hypertension. For women plagued by heartburn, antacids are safe for
use in any trimester, but bicarbonate of soda, magnesium
trisilicate and the new H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors are
potentially toxic to the fetus.
</P>
<P>
   Reports on the safety of the new antidepressants called
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI.'s) have been mixed.
One large study of Prozac found no increase in miscarriage or major
birth defects, but infants exposed in the womb were more likely to
have minor defects. The latest report, based on 524 pregnancies,
half of which involved the use of an SSRI, found no increase in
major malformations, miscarriage, stillbirth or premature birth
associated with the either the SSRI's or tricyclic antidepressant
drugs taken in recommended doses during pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Although most medications taken in normal doses by a nursing
mother are safe for infants, a few are definitely too toxic for a
baby. These include chemotherapy drugs to treat cancer; lithium to
treat bipolar disorder and drugs like cyclosporine that suppress
the immune system. Even when taking a safe drug, a nursing mother
would be wise to coordinate the dosages with the baby's schedule,
just after the baby has been fed or before the baby's longest
sleep.
</P>
<P>
   For more information about the safety of over-the-counter drugs
during pregnancy, see ``I'm Pregnant and I Have a Cold'' by Dr.
Craig V. Towers, a perinatologist in California at Long Beach
Memorial Medical Center, just published by RBC Press ($27.95 in
hardcover, $14.95 in paperback). Other Substances of Concern
</P>
<P>
   Barbara K. Hackley, a nurse midwife at the Yale School of
Nursing, recently reviewed the safety of immunizations during
pregnancy in The Journal of Nurse-Midwifery. She approves of the
toxoid and inactivated vaccines _ tetanus, diphtheria, hepatitis B,
influenza and pneumococcal vaccines _ although she advises that
even these vaccines are best given in the second and third
trimesters in case they may have some effect yet unrecognized on a
young fetus. Flu vaccine (taken each fall to include the latest
strains) is now recommended for all pregnant women. To be avoided
are live virus and bacterial vaccines, including those for measles,
mumps, rubella and chicken pox.
</P>
<P>
   Legal recreational drugs like alcohol, nicotine and caffeine are
also common concerns among pregnant women. Cigarette smoking during
pregnancy can compromise fetal growth, resulting in babies that are
smaller than they should be at birth, and may also cause
long-lasting intellectual deficits. Heavy consumption of alcohol
during pregnancy causes fetal alcohol syndrome marked by subnormal
growth, muscle and heart damage, and low intelligence or mental
retardation. Although an occasional drink is highly unlikely to
have any adverse effect on a developing fetus, the Food and Drug
Administration advises pregnant women to refrain from drinking any
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Caffeine and coffee, on the other hand, have been pretty much
cleared of earlier suspicions of fetal harm, at least when consumed
in moderation: no more than three cups of coffee a day. In 1980,
after reports of birth defects in mice induced by caffeine, the FDA
warned pregnant women to limit their intake of coffee. But
considerable evidence accumulated since has not implicated coffee
as a cause of birth defects in humans. Still, there is some
evidence that consuming more than three cups of coffee a day may
slightly reduce birth weights.

 &HT;    Cut loose on New Year's Eve? They'll pass
 &HT;    By Ricardo Gandara
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Hey, not everybody is attending Sandra Bullock's
New Year's bash. Or dining at Sullivan's. Or shooting bullets into
the night sky.
</P>
<P>
   Some people are staying home. Maybe they're on a different
calendar. Maybe they interpret our calendar differently. Maybe they
just don't care.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Dickey is hunkering down with his family. ``What better way
to break in the new year? If I'm going to be hugging and kissing
anyone on New Year's, it will be my family,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Denise, and sons, Benjamin and Samuel, 4 and almost 2,
are making cheese pizza on New Year's Eve. They'll splurge on
chocolate ice cream. They'll play indoor basketball and, when
everyone is tuckered out, watch a rented movie and eat popcorn.
``Maybe even do some arts and crafts with the kids,'' he says.
Maybe they won't fall asleep by midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Exciting, huh? ``Nothing better,'' Dickey says.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Davis, president of the Pagan Alliance of Central Texas,
doesn't observe New Year's _ at least not on Dec. 31. The Pagan New
Year, known as the feast of Samhain, is from sundown Oct. 31 to
sundown Nov. 1. ``In old Europe it was the feast of the last
harvest. Most importantly, it's the time when the veil between the
world we live in and the world of spirit is the thinnest. We
remember and celebrate our beloved dead,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   So what will he be doing on New Year's Eve when some of us are
having the time of our lives? At 7 a.m. Dec. 31, he'll be watching
TV to see if there are any Y2K glitches in Australia when it turns
midnight there. ``I want to watch very carefully what happens in
the world because it will give us a good indication what will
happen here,'' he says. ``This is just me. I'll do the normal stuff
that I usually do. Sleep and eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin Tan's New Year is some time around mid-April 2000. He's
Buddhist and follows the Burmese calendar. So this Jan. 1 ``is a
normal day,'' he says. ``We'll do the normal things like clean
house, go shopping, take the kids to the library.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin, that's a Saturday, and it's a national holiday because
there are six bowl games on the tube. ``Oh,'' he says,
recalculating, ``we'll probably just stay home.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the party poopers who keep insisting that the new
millennium doesn't start until 2001. They keep reading all that
rational stuff on the U.S. Naval Observatory's Web site: ``The end
of the second millennium and the beginning of the third will be
reached on Jan. 1, 2001. This date is based on the now globally
recognized Gregorian calendar ... Rather than starting with the
year zero, years in this calendar begin with the date Jan. 1, 1
Anno Domini (AD). Consequently, the next millennium does not begin
until Jan. 1, 2001 AD.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, yeah, yeah. So what if they're the official timekeepers?
So what if they're right? We may not be around Dec. 31, 2000. WE
WANT TO PARTY NOW!
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe not Melanie Carter. This 57-year-old isn't going to
be a homebody, but she's hardly tearing up the town. On New Year's
morning she's going house to house as she does every year. She has
a list of elderly shut-ins who look forward to her home-cooked
meals on Christmas and New Year's. This year it's a rice, cheese
and broccoli casserole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is more important. I'll celebrate the following
weekend when I go visit my daughter in Fort Worth,'' she says.
``Know what? She's staying home New Year's Eve and New Year's Day
to avoid the drunks. Hey, some of us stay boring just to stay
alive.''

   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ When I heard about the
largest-ever gift in University of Dayton history, the number
simply staggered me. No, not the $10 million pledge, $2 million a
year over five years. It was that class of '78 number that stunned
me. My class. John McHale is 43 years old. My age. I graduated from
Miami University in 1978, and I still can't figure out the high
finances of my son's Cub Scout popcorn sales. What business does
McHale have, a kid like us, with so much spare cash to donate to
his alma mater? (McCarty, Dayton Daily News) MOVED

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ Not only are the Israelis trying again to make

THE DIET ALL MEN WILL LOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ This has to be the perfect lunch.
</P>
<P>
   My wife is at Greens with a friend, enjoying marinated tofu
brochette with brown rice, and I'm sitting in a row of men at the
counter of Original Joe's eating piles of meat.
</P>
<P>
   And I'm the one on a diet.
</P>
<P>
   It's the modified Dr. Atkins low-carbohydrate, no-hunger caveman
weight-loss plan, the diet half the men in America are on, and
quite a few women. Cathy of the comic strip complained that it
can't be a diet because it's not painful enough.
</P>
<P>
   Look at it this way, Cathy. It's painful to think I've become as
full of magical thinking as those who believe breaking a cookie
lets the calories leak out. Or that food speared from somebody
else's plate doesn't count.
</P>
<P>
   I've stopped using sugar in my coffee and already can tell the
difference between the stuff in the blue packets and the stuff in
the pink packets. You might even find me snacking in that
calorie-free zone: grocery store lines. But you won't find me
chomping on baguettes.
</P>
<P>
   I'll be following Dr. Atkins' advice, and eating the
protein-rich nuts and jerky that ancient hunter-gatherers used as
fuel, after I hunt and gather them on Aisle 4.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what you eat at Original Joe's if you're on a diet _
``the diet plate.'' It's a 12-ounce hamburger steak the size and
shape of a half-inflated football, served with cottage cheese and
fruit. You know, so the plate can shout ``diet.''
</P>
<P>
   It's acceptable on Dr. Atkins' diet, all but the fruit. Fructose
is murder.
</P>
<P>
   Just a year or two ago I laughed at this quaint diet plate,
which probably has been on Original Joe's menu the entire 62 years
it's been in business.
</P>
<P>
   A hamburger, hold the bun? Don't they know anything about fat,
cholesterol and the deadly capacities of red meat?
</P>
<P>
   Then I read Dr. Atkins' suggestions for a strict beginning diet.
They included bacon and eggs (no toast, hash browns or orange
juice) for breakfast and perhaps a bacon cheeseburger (no bun) for
lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Life is suddenly glorious, imitating that Woody Allen movie
about a future in which scientists discover that chocolate sundaes
are good for you.
</P>
<P>
   Well, they aren't. Not yet, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   I knew I loved Dr. Atkins when I looked at the recipes in the
back of his book, ``Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution.'' There was
bearnaise sauce, made with clarified butter, not tofu juice. Go
ahead, spoon it all over oily salmon filets.
</P>
<P>
   And there was guacamole, hold the starchy chips, which are just
a form of transportation anyway. Oh boy, we get to dip with our
fingers.
</P>
<P>
   What really made me a believer was the ``Swiss snack,'' cubes of
Swiss cheese wrapped in bacon, then deep-fried in hot oil.
</P>
<P>
   Mmm, mmm, good. Enough grease to clog the Lincoln Tunnel. No
wonder Dr. Atkins recommends regular check-ups and cholesterol
tests.
</P>
<P>
   I know a lot of men following some version of Dr. Atkins'
low-carbohydrate diet, usually the high-steak-intake version, and
they claim to be losing weight. Of course, the dead men aren't
talking.
</P>
<P>
   So far I've managed to stay on this diet for a week. Although I
haven't lost much weight, I haven't died either. Mostly I've eaten
sensible low-carbohydrate foods like grilled fish and broccoli, or
tofu and broccoli soup, or bits of chicken with broccoli.
</P>
<P>
   My wife, who shares these feasts, is losing weight like Gandhi
on Fen-Phen. Life isn't fair, and she doesn't have Cathy's problems
or mine.
</P>
<P>
   This diet may sound grim, but I get to add toasted almonds. And
I get to eat cans of tuna at lunch.
</P>
<P>
   That's a pleasure left over from bachelor days when there was
nothing in the fridge but mustard and mayo, and the only thing to
stir them into was a can of tuna from the cupboard.
</P>
<P>
   Forget Jesse Ventura. Dr. Atkins is the new super hero to
red-blooded, red-meat eating males. Our red blood, unfortunately,
has to be refrigerated and skimmed like fatty chicken soup.
</P>

   HMO: Beginning next year, Medicare beneficiaries in HMOs will
face the biggest cut in benefits in this decade. Premiums also are
going up in most HMOs. The is happening nationwide because of
federal cutbacks in Medicare payments, health-care inflation and
the rising cost of prescription drugs. About 50,000 Kasas City area
seniors are enrolled in Medicare HMOs. This doesn't affect the
200,000 local folks who just get regular Medicare, which provides
fewer benefits. Graphic. Photo. Alan Bavley. 38.

   HOLD: A bill that will be offered in the next Missouri General
Assembly would extend the 20-hour hold law to 48 hours for felonies
such as murder, rape, etc. Police say its long been needed. They
complain that the 20-hour hold does not allow them to build a case
to charge a suspect and that, as result, dangerous felons are
released with charges pending. Legal advocates say extending the
hold will only mean that innocent people will be held longer in
jail. 25. Malcum Garcia.

said. Ed Fletcher and Christine Vendel. 15.

   IMPACT: Kansas City leaders wants developers who build in the
Northland to start paying an arterial street impact fee to help pay
for new road construction. The new fee would be based on the amount
of rush-hour traffic that a new development would generate.
According to the formula that the city would use, a drive-in bank
would have to pay the most while a residential development would
pay much less. Developers agree that there needs to be some kind of
funding mechanism for street construction but are concerned about
some aspects of the proposal. 30. Photo, graphic. Mike Rice.

CBS STUMBLES ONTO A GOOD SHOW IN `NOW AND AGAIN' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of television's most thrilling shows is ``Now and Again,''
and it has nothing to do with cheap action or riveting drama.
</P>
<P>
   The program is a treasure, a wonderful, inexplicable piece of
work that separates itself from the pack mostly by being so hard to
pigeonhole. And pigeonholing is a byproduct of life in Hollywood,
where no show gets the green light unless the producer can say
``It's `NYPD Blue' meets `Dawson's Creek.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now and Again'' (9 p.m. EDT Fridays on CBS) becomes thrilling
just because it's different each week, an hour that is not
predictable or by the numbers. It hasn't achieved a level of
greatness yet and may never. It's not a landmark show. It doesn't
play like a feature film as does ``The Sopranos.'' It never flexes
its acting muscle like ``ER,'' or desires to have its uniqueness
easily identifiable like ``Sports Night.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, people who haven't sampled the series are probably
thinking, ``Isn't that the show about the fortysomething couple
having lots of sex?''
</P>
<P>
   It's not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now and Again'' is a show that got on the air because Leslie
Moonves, in his effort to turn around CBS, approached
``Moonlighting'' creator Glenn Gordon Caron and said, in essence,
``Make any show you want.''
</P>
<P>
   And Caron decided that he would make a TV show that critics
immediately thought was a kind of reworking of ``The Six Million
Dollar Man,'' but was really inspired by ``Damn Yankees.'' And that
should be enough to tell you that ``Now and Again'' is wholly
different than most of what else is on television.
</P>
<P>
   It would be wrong to come to this series expecting it to
levitate. That's not the point. The genius of the show _ OK, it
does kind of hover _ is that it's not exactly about what you think
it's about. There are nuances and fun little moments that stand out
without needing to scream ``quirky!'' like ``Ally McBeal.'' It
manages to be filled with sci-fi moments without remotely looking
like ``The X- Files.'' The dialogue is rich and playful without
using the kind of sledgehammer approach that helps separate Aaron
Sorkin's ``West Wing'' from other dramas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now and Again'' hooks viewers by doing a lot of little things
well and subtly, by being continuously entertaining without having
to be dumb or laughtrack-saturated in the process.
</P>
<P>
   The series had the most jarringly audacious pilot in some time,
with guest star John Goodman portraying an Everyman insurance
broker named Michael Wiseman who gets knocked in front of _ and
killed by _ a speeding subway train. He wakes up to find his brain
put in the body of a government-created superman of sorts, played
by Eric Close.
</P>
<P>
   No great creative leaps there. And neither do they come in the
rules he must live by: Contact your wife (Margaret Colin) or
daughter (Heather Matarazzo) and you'll be killed. It's a tidy
formula that leads viewers to believe the show will be about one
thing (government science project built to counteract terrorism),
but is ultimately about something else: Relationships.
</P>
<P>
   It's about Michael Wiseman longing for his wife and kid, but not
being able to reconnect (a la ``Damn Yankees'') because he no
longer exists. Switching gears, changing these emotional tones, is
what Caron is particularly adept at and why this show brings
viewers back. It's not the same thing every second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now and Again'' plays to all kinds of audiences. Yes, there's
action. There's even that sci-fi element (he can bend steel, climb
walls, etc.). It's a family show. It's a romance. There's comedy.
And with Dennis Haysbert playing the scientist who created this new
almost-human defender of the people, there's a detached hipness
that attracts viewers looking for something slightly off, less
predictable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now and Again'' is not boldly original. Just when you think
it's going to become something really special, it stays
conventional. That's disappointing on one level, but staying within
the confines of the drama formula (particularly on staid CBS) is
exactly the reason the show is still on the air.

JOHN M. ESHLEMAN, BLACKLISTED REPORTER, DIES AT 85 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: Ore.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LARRY D. HATFIELD  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ John M. ``Jack'' Eshleman, a reporter who was
fired by the San Francisco Examiner and blackballed by the
newspaper industry for refusing to answer questions from a
communist-hunting House panel in the 1950s, died on Nov. 5 at
Kaiser Hospital in San Francisco of complications from surgery. He
was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Eshleman, who was the son of the late California Lt. Gov. John
M. Eshleman, was a 1936 graduate of the University of California at
Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   He was hired as a reporter by the Examiner, then moved to United
Press, which would later become United Press International. He also
worked at the old Oakland Post-Enquirer before World War II, then
at the Kaiser Shipyard in Richmond during the war. He went back to
work for the Examiner in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   In 1957, he was subpoenaed to testify before the House
Un-American Activities Committee, then holding hearings in San
Francisco. Although he told the committee that he was not then a
member of the Communist Party and did not sympathize with the
party, Eshleman declined to answer any questions about his past
associates or political activities.
</P>
<P>
   After he invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege not to testify,
he was summarily fired by the Examiner. Associates, his family, and
Eshleman said he was not able to work again as a reporter, except
for short periods of time, because of an informal blacklist against
suspected communists and other leftists.
</P>
<P>
   The firing was vigorously opposed by what was then known as the
San Francisco Newspaper Guild (now the Northern California Media
Workers Guild), which he joined in 1937. An arbitrator eventually
ruled that ``the menace of communism'' and Eshleman's refusal to
testify were ``just and sufficient cause'' for his removal. His
legal exercise of his Fifth Amendment rights left ``a question
mark'' about his background, the arbitrator said.
</P>
<P>
   Family members and former colleagues said that whenever Eshleman
was able to find a job at other newspapers in the San Francisco
area, he was fired as soon as his new employers found out about his
past.
</P>
<P>
   Eshleman, who lived in Berkeley, was editor of several labor
journals, including the East Bay Labor Journal, the Journeyman and
others. He was the first chairman of the retirees' unit of the
Northern California Newspaper Guild and was a member of the Alameda
County Federation of Retired Union Members.
</P>
<P>
   He also was active in many environmental and political causes.
He vigorously stumped for universal health insurance as legislative
director of the Congress of California Seniors.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his son, Dr. Alan M. Eshleman of Berkeley, and
a daughter, Ann Eshleman Haynes of Ashland, Ore. Private memorial
services were planned.

RESCUERS CONTINUE FRANTIC SEARCH IN RUBBLE OF COLLAPSED BUILDING 
</HEADLINE>
 PM-ITALY-APARTMENT-NYT  (gm) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ With 30 people dead and 27 other residents still missing,
rescue workers at the site of a collapsed apartment building in
Foggia in southern Italy continued digging through the smoking
debris Friday.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 10 residents have been pulled from the wreckage alive
and taken to hospitals. Five other people managed to flee the
building after hearing ominous creaking minutes before the
six-story building collapsed at 3:15 a.m. on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the collapse, thick black smoke began rising from
concrete slabs, a result of fires that probably began in piles of
mattresses stored in the basement, firefighters said. At least two
badly charred bodies were extracted Friday as emergency workers
struggled to uncover what officials fear may be the worst such
accident in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the victims died of asphyxiation minutes after the
building collapsed, according to Alberto Pedone, head of forensics
at the hospital of Foggia.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue workers, relying on sniffing dogs and sounding probes,
dug through the night seeking signs of life. But there was little
hope that more survivors would be found.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian president, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, visited the site
Friday and went to see the survivors in the hospital, including two
toddlers. One child lost a mother in the accident and the other
lost both parents.
</P>
<P>
   City officials evacuated residents of the twin building next to
the ruins as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
   Panic spread to other parts of Italy, where concerns about
shoddy construction have been an issue for decades. In Milan, 500
residents of a 12-story building asked to be evacuated, saying
their building had structural problems. In Rome, some mothers
refused to send their children to Giulio Cesare, a primary school,
Friday morning, complaining of cracks in the walls of the basement
cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials dismissed the idea that faulty construction
caused the Foggia accident, a fear that is widely felt in Southern
Italy, which has a long postwar legacy of illegal and substandard
construction.
</P>
<P>
   The worst such accident occurred in 1959 in Baretta, a town
south of Foggia. An apartment building collapsed after new floors
were added illegally, killing 60 people.
</P>
<P>
   In Rome last December, 27 people died after a five-story
apartment building collapsed. Investigators later concluded that
the cause was structural damage.

<P>
   What began, at least officially, as a limited campaign to stamp
out terrorism and create a ``security zone'' around Chechnya, is
looking more and more like a full-scale war.
</P>
<P>
   It has many parallels with, as well as differences from, the
first Chechen war, which ended in 1996. Both the parallels and the
differences are, to say the least, very disquieting.
</P>
<P>
   The main, tragic similarity is, of course, the incredible toll
on the people of Chechnya. While Russian officials are trying hard
to play down the scale of the humanitarian catastrophe, the
refugees tell a different story.
</P>
<P>
   There are tens of thousands of them, shivering in makeshift
tents or living in overcrowded homes in the neighboring republic of
Ingushetia. The unluckier ones have died in air raids and missile
attacks, such as the one that killed and wounded hundreds of
civilians in Grozny's central market on Oct. 21.
</P>
<P>
   But, whereas the first war was very unpopular among the Russian
public, this time it is different. In part, the Chechens themselves
are to blame for this lack of compassion. As Fiona Hill of the U.S.
human rights organization Freedom House recently pointed out,
``sympathy for them rapidly dissipated in the face of blatant
kidnappings, assassinations, murders and attacks on economic
targets in neighboring areas.''
</P>
<P>
   The invasion of Dagestan, to the east, this past summer, led by
the Islamic warlord Shamil Basayev, left the Russian government no
option but to respond with force _ this, at least, is the position
taken in favor of the bloody Russian assault.
</P>
<P>
   But what really infuriated Russian public opinion and made it
support the military campaign were the terrorist bombings in Moscow
and other Russian cities, which killed hundreds of people and were
widely, though so far without proof, attributed to ``Chechen
bandits.''
</P>
<P>
   Continuing public support for the war, which has resulted in a
sharp rise in the popularity of Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin,
is disturbing. It is of course natural for any nation to rally in
support of its soldiers. But people seem to be too eager to swallow
the crude official propaganda, and the media too willing to play
along.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian generals, who still blame the media and the
politicians for their defeat in the first war, have seized upon the
initial popular support with a vengeance. This time, the generals
made it very clear that they will be in the driver's seat.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, top officers, such as Gen. Anatoly Kvashnin, chief
of the Russian general staff, and Gen. Vladimir Shamanov, commander
of the Western forces in Chechnya, have publicly and not too subtly
warned of possible mutiny and even civil war should their hard-line
campaign be thwarted by the political leadership in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   This, for the Russian military, which typically steers clear of
politics, is extremely unusual behavior, and it is the most
disturbing aspect of the war. If left unchecked, it could lead to a
political tragedy compounding the human tragedy that we are
witnessing.
</P>
<P>
   With Moscow's politics increasingly opaque under multiple layers
of intrigue, we will probably not know any time soon what prompted
President Boris N. Yeltsin to rush back to Moscow Nov. 3 from his
vacation on the Black Sea. But reports are rife that army generals
were threatening to resign in protest unless they were allowed to
fight the war their way, to an all-out victory.
</P>
<P>
   Since returning to Moscow, Yeltsin has been characteristically
enigmatic. Allowing a situation like this to occur in the first
place was another of the many failures of his political leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Most Russian politicians have appeared all too eager to jump on
the war bandwagon. The Communists and Vladimir Zhirinovsky's
extreme nationalist group are the most vociferous supporters of the
war, but even among the younger generations, whose main agenda is
economic reform, few have dared to criticize the way the war is
being prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   What little criticism there has been comes from former Prime
Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov, who says that he is against turning
the campaign into a full-scale war, and Grigory Yavlinsky, leader
of the Yabloko Party, a pro-Western advocate of reform, who has
called for a conditional cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Even such expressions of common sense have been politically
costly: Primakov's popularity ratings have been declining, in part
because he is seen as insufficiently tough, and Yavlinsky's
initiative has been roundly criticized by politicians of various
stripes and, according to opinion polls, has little popular
support.
</P>
<P>
   Given all this, it is hard to be optimistic. The war is set to
continue, although even a victory of the Russian army is likely to
be hollow. From the mountains in the south, Chechen fighters will
continue to launch raids and exhaust Russian troops, whose
casualties are now probably higher than admitted by Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Any turn for the better would be most likely to result from a
reconsideration of the situation by the Russian people. There are
some signs that such rethinking may have started. The Russian press
is beginning to publish stories that run counter to the official
propaganda line. Opinion polls indicate that a growing percentage
of the people are having doubts about the war. Some observers
believe that support for it has peaked and will soon begin to wane.
</P>
<P>
   One hopes reason will emerge to influence the course of events
and prevent the tragic situation in Chechnya from getting any
worse.

tents or living in overcrowded homes in the neighboring republic of
Ingushetia. The unluckier ones have died in air raids and missile
attacks, such as the one that killed and wounded hundreds of
civilians in Grozny's central market on Oct. 21.
</P>
<P>
   But, whereas the first war was very unpopular among the Russian
public, this time it is different. In part, the Chechens themselves
are to blame for this lack of compassion. As Fiona Hill of the U.S.
human rights organization Freedom House recently pointed out,
``sympathy for them rapidly dissipated in the face of blatant
kidnappings, assassinations, murders and attacks on economic
targets in neighboring areas.''
</P>
<P>
   The invasion of Dagestan, to the east, this past summer, led by
the Islamic warlord Shamil Basayev, left the Russian government no
option but to respond with force _ this, at least, is the position
taken in favor of the bloody Russian assault.
</P>
<P>
   But what really infuriated Russian public opinion and made it
support the military campaign were the terrorist bombings in Moscow
and other Russian cities, which killed hundreds of people and were
widely, though so far without proof, attributed to ``Chechen
bandits.''
</P>
<P>
   Continuing public support for the war, which has resulted in a
sharp rise in the popularity of Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin,
is disturbing. It is of course natural for any nation to rally in
support of its soldiers. But people seem to be too eager to swallow
the crude official propaganda, and the media too willing to play
along.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian generals, who still blame the media and the
politicians for their defeat in the first war, have seized upon the
initial popular support with a vengeance. This time, the generals
made it very clear that they will be in the driver's seat.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, top officers, such as Gen. Anatoly Kvashnin, chief
of the Russian general staff, and Gen. Vladimir Shamanov, commander
of the Western forces in Chechnya, have publicly and not too subtly
warned of possible mutiny and even civil war should their hard-line
campaign be thwarted by the political leadership in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   This, for the Russian military, which typically steers clear of
politics, is extremely unusual behavior, and it is the most
disturbing aspect of the war. If left unchecked, it could lead to a
political tragedy compounding the human tragedy that we are
witnessing.
</P>
<P>
   With Moscow's politics increasingly opaque under multiple layers
of intrigue, we will probably not know any time soon what prompted
President Boris N. Yeltsin to rush back to Moscow Nov. 3 from his
vacation on the Black Sea. But reports are rife that army generals
were threatening to resign in protest unless they were allowed to
fight the war their way, to an all-out victory.
</P>
<P>
   Since returning to Moscow, Yeltsin has been characteristically
enigmatic. Allowing a situation like this to occur in the first
place was another of the many failures of his political leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Most Russian politicians have appeared all too eager to jump on
the war bandwagon. The Communists and Vladimir Zhirinovsky's
extreme nationalist group are the most vociferous supporters of the
war, but even among the younger generations, whose main agenda is
economic reform, few have dared to criticize the way the war is
being prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   What little criticism there has been comes from former Prime
Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov, who says that he is against turning
the campaign into a full-scale war, and Grigory Yavlinsky, leader
of the Yabloko Party, a pro-Western advocate of reform, who has
called for a conditional cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Even such expressions of common sense have been politically
costly: Primakov's popularity ratings have been declining, in part
because he is seen as insufficiently tough, and Yavlinsky's
initiative has been roundly criticized by politicians of various
stripes and, according to opinion polls, has little popular
support.
</P>
<P>
   Given all this, it is hard to be optimistic. The war is set to
continue, although even a victory of the Russian army is likely to
be hollow. From the mountains in the south, Chechen fighters will
continue to launch raids and exhaust Russian troops, whose
casualties are now probably higher than admitted by Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Any turn for the better would be most likely to result from a
reconsideration of the situation by the Russian people. There are
some signs that such rethinking may have started. The Russian press
is beginning to publish stories that run counter to the official
propaganda line. Opinion polls indicate that a growing percentage
of the people are having doubts about the war. Some observers
believe that support for it has peaked and will soon begin to wane.
</P>
<P>
   One hopes reason will emerge to influence the course of events
and prevent the tragic situation in Chechnya from getting any
worse.

PLAYBOY AIMS FOR WEBCAST THAT WON'T FALL FLAT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: David Bloom's weekly Digital L.A. column on technology and
entertainment. Note italics.) 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Remember the big Victoria's Secret lingerie show
on the Internet last winter? The show was a qualified success,
drawing a record crowd of online viewers willing to put up with a
tiny, jerky picture to watch supermodels in skivvies.
</P>
<P>
   But the bigger story was actually the people who (BEGIN
ITAL)couldn't(END ITAL) watch the show. Though Vickie's and partner
Broadcast.com (now merged into Yahoo! Broadcast Services) could
boast a huge audience, they spent more time explaining why so many
people couldn't get in.
</P>
<P>
   Playboy faces the same challenges with an even more ambitious
online broadcast this week of, well, more good-looking women
wearing underwear. But Playboy officials promise they and their
partner, San Diego-based Intervu, will be able to handle the load.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology has really changed leaps and bounds since
Victoria's Secret did it,'' said Eric Deutsch, vice president of
worldwide production for Playboy Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   One difference is the way Intervu _ as with some of its major
Webcasting competitors _ sprinkles its computer servers around the
country, distributing the viewer demand and reducing the network
load to manageable levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Victoria's Secret Webcast, they tried to route
everyone through one location that was sending out signals all over
the world,'' said Michael Manley, a producer for Playboy's Cyber
Club subscription site (cyber.playboy.com). ``Instead of having
them all go down one tunnel, this is taking them closer out to
where their access point is.''
</P>
<P>
   The actual event is tied to the debut of a new Playboy video,
called ``Club Lingerie,'' and the company will hold a fashion show
with its models wearing the lingerie, much of it branded with the
Playboy label. And when the show's over, the video and most of the
lingerie will be sold online at Playboy.com
(www.playboy.com/clublingerie) in an admirable bit of Web-savvy
marketing and promotion.
</P>
<P>
   The fashion show and party will be broadcast live on the
company's pay-per-view cable TV network. And the company will have
two Webcasts, one without charge or nudity from the catwalk that
will be shown on the main Playboy.com site.
</P>
<P>
   The other Webcast on the Cyber Club site will be more risque _
going behind the scenes of the show and party _ and expensive, at
$5.95 per viewer. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
A Troma-tic experience &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of brave and crazy Web events tied to the Playboy
Mansion this week, the wacky folks over at Troma Entertainment will
be christening their vastly expanded and revamped Web site on
Monday with a live Webcast from there, where they're shooting the
next ``Toxic Avenger'' sequel.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Troma will be filming the ``killing'' of the
fan who won their latest contest (The upside? He also accompanies
Tromites to promote the movie at the Cannes Film Festival).
</P>
<P>
   New York-based Troma specializes in sex and gore schlockfests
such as ``Tromeo and Juliet,'' ``Attack of the Killer Tomatoes''
and the just-released ``Terror Firmer.''
</P>
<P>
   With Tromaville.com (at www.tromaville.com), the company plans
to vastly expand its film library, offering about 1,000 horror and
similar B movies, along with chat rooms, Troma gear and much more.
It should also be horrifyingly good fun. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Come on feel the Webnoize
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, MP-3s were just starting to hit it big, and the
Webnoize conference at a Universal City hotel deftly brought
together a lot of heavy hitters trying to figure out what music on
the Net would mean. Well, things have changed a bit in 12 months,
and here comes Webnoize '99 to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I think you're going to see is a lot of companies try to
justify this year what they theorized last year,'' said Webnoize
chairman Ted Cohen, the music-business veteran who organized the
two conferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was, `How crazy is this MP-3 thing?''' said Joanne
Marino, CEO of the conference's eponymous parent company. ``This
year, it's, `How are you going to make money?' It's sort of like,
`Let's get down to business.'''
</P>
<P>
   The conference has moved this year to the Century Plaza Hotel in
Century City and runs Monday through Wednesday. As with last year,
there are more worthwhile sessions than you'll probably be able to
attend, an array of exhibitors showing off their music technology,
and plenty of networking opportunities. For more information, go to

 &HT;    IN TURKEY, CLINTON TO FOCUS ON PIPELINE FOR OIL-RICH CASPIAN
REGION
 &HT;    EDs: For locator map purposes, the proposed U.S.-turkey pipeline
would run from the Caspian coastal city of Baku, in Azerbaijan,
through the republic of Georgia, then into Turkey, terminating at
the river port of Ceyhan.
 &HT;    For Use Sun., Nov. 14 And Thereafter.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Marco Polo was intrigued by it nearly eight
centuries ago. The British fought for it in World War I, as did the
Turks. Hitler sent thousands of troops after it, ferrying supplies
at times on camels, in a desperate and ultimately futile quest.
</P>
<P>
   Now the vast crude oil of the Caspian Sea, the prize that has
eluded foreign capture by so many for so long, appears at last
within the grasp of the Western world.
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton arrives Monday in the Turkish capital of
Ankara for a state visit with Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, high on
the agenda will be the formal inking of an agreement to support the
commercial construction of a pipeline connecting the oil-rich
Caspian to the Turkish port of Ceyhan 1,100 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The $4 billion artery would be able, sometime early next
century, to pump 1 million barrels a day of sour Caspian crude into
the holds of tankers lying in wait in the Mediterranean Sea, from
there to stoke the economies of the United States and two dozen of
its closest allies.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more to the point, it would give the United States,
Europe and Israel direct access to oilfields that could hold as
much as one-fifth of the world's remaining crude, providing a
strategically valuable alternative to Western dependence on
supplies from the volatile Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes are very big,'' said former National Security
Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski, who served in the Carter
Administration. ``Having unlimited access to it, access which is
not controlled by a potentially hostile power, is very much in our
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Landlocked within the confines of Iran to its south and the
former Soviet Union to its east, west and north, the 700-mile-long
Caspian Sea contains at least six separate hydrocarbon basins,
massive underground formations that trapped plant and animal
detritus hundreds of millions of years ago and have held it captive
ever since in the form of oil and natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   Proven crude oil reserves are estimated in the range of 20
billion barrels or so, comparable to the 22.5 billion barrels in
the United States and 17 billion barrels in the North Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Industry geologists speculate, however, that the Caspian region
could hold up to 200 billion barrels. That would be as much as Iraq
and Iran put together and would equal 20 percent of the world's
proven reserves of 1 trillion barrels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take a lot of years, and a lot of wells, before
we know whether the Caspian region holds 30 billion barrels or 130
billion,'' international oil executive Nick Zana, of the San
Francisco-based Chevron Corp., told his peers at a conference in
London earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, said Zana, ``there's far too much at stake to stop
investing.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. oil industry, indeed, has plans to invest tens of
billions of dollars in exploration, drilling, refining and
transportation projects in the region over the coming decade.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron alone has agreed to invest $20 billion over the next 40
years in an oil development venture with the government of
Kazakhstan, along the Caspian's northeast coast.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Caspian, in Azerbaijan, the Exxon Corp., based in
Irving, Texas, has staked a major claim. Atlantic-Richfield, BP
Amoco, Mobil, Texaco, Pennzoil, Phillips Petroleum and others are
also heavily committed to the Caspian, following in the footsteps
of prospectors who began tapping the region's treasure through
shallow hand-dug wells more than 200 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   All have faced two main problems: geography and geopolitics in a
harsh and remote region whose history of turbulence and bloodshed
rivals that of the Balkans 1,000 miles to its west.
</P>
<P>
   For most of this century, the bulk of the Caspian's yield was
used to fuel the Soviet Union. It's break-up eight years ago,
however, left Caspian crude largely in the hands of Iran and four
formerly Soviet republics: Russia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and
Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
   Still, only a small web of pipelines exists to transport the
oil. Most pass through the embattled region of Chechnya en route to
the Russian port of Novorosiisk on the Black Sea. Transportation
from there to the Western world depends on tankers moving first
through the Bosporus then the Dardanelles straits _ ancient
commercial and strategic chokepoints, both under Turkish control.
</P>
<P>
   For years now, American, British and Dutch oil companies have
been locked in complicated international negotiations over the
possibility of building several new Caspian pipelines. The most
ambitious, being studied by a consortium that includes Exxon,
envisions a tube snaking for some 5,000 miles through the Himalayas
and the Gobi desert to pipe oil to western China, at a cost
estimated at upwards of $8.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Turkey's Ecevit are expected to sign, as early as
Monday, an accord meant to support a commercial project to build an
oil pipeline that would run from the Caspian coastal city of Baku,
in Azerbaijan, through the republic of Georgia, then into Turkey,
terminating at the river port of Ceyhan.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders are also expected to give their blessing to a
separate natural gas pipeline from Ceyhan to Turkmenistan. Roughly
1,200 miles long, that pipeline would travel beneath the Caspian
from Turkmenistan then overland through Azerbaijan, Georgia and
into Turkey.

A WEEKEND IN 1963 THAT FOREVER CHANGED HISTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REBECA RODRIGUEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The sun was shining and a slight breeze was
blowing at the cemetery on that Monday in east Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   The light-gray casket was lowered into a grave, and those
gathered bowed their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Inside lay Lee Harvey Oswald, the 24-year-old man police believe
killed President John F. Kennedy on Nov. 22, 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Among the two dozen people gathered for Oswald's burial that day
was Bob Bruton, then a 31-year-old program director for KXOL/1360
AM radio in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Bruton covered Kennedy's speeches in Fort Worth for the radio
station that fateful Friday and also reported the events that
unfolded at Dallas' Parkland Memorial Hospital in the moments
before Kennedy was declared dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked all of Friday afternoon and night, and all day
Saturday,'' said Bruton, 67, of Colleyville. ``Things began to wind
down Saturday afternoon and I went in to the station and made a
recording of my thoughts and impressions.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruton only thought things had died down. He would soon be
reporting on another wrinkle in one of the biggest news stories of
the century.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, a Sunday, he was cooking breakfast at home and
was watching the transfer of Oswald to the Dallas County Jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw (Oswald's) assassination on television live, as it was
happening,'' Bruton said. ``I saw it and I was on my way.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruton headed to Parkland once again, this time to report on
Oswald's death.
</P>
<P>
   Oswald's funeral was held the next day at Shannon's Rose Hill
Cemetery in east Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wanted to get it over with,'' Bruton said.
</P>
<P>
   Bruton arrived at the cemetery, along with other news media
representatives, and entered the gates of the highly secured
cemetery. Three graves had been dug and Bruton did not know which
one was for Oswald. He wandered around trying to figure it out when
he saw a woman sitting alone in a car near one of the graves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked up, introduced myself and asked, `Do you know where
they are burying Lee Harvey Oswald?''' Bruton said. ``She took me
to the trunk of her car and there was a plaque with black and gold
letters that said Lee Harvey Oswald with his date of birth and date
of death.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman, who was a cemetery employee, and Bruton waited for
others to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Oswald's widow, Marina; his mother; and his brother
arrived by limousine, escorted by Secret Service and FBI agents.
Bruton recalls that there was no minister in Fort Worth who would
agree to perform the last rites.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a couple who agreed to say some words, but the head
of the ministerial alliance finally had to do the service.''
</P>
<P>
   Oswald's family had not seen his body since he was killed, so
the casket was opened to let them take one last look, Bruton said.
</P>
<P>
   Marina Oswald ``took her wedding ring off and put it on the
right-hand little finger of Lee Harvey Oswald,'' Bruton recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was super somber,'' he said.

NEVADA AUTHORITIES BELIEVE HIKER KILLED BY MOUNTAIN LION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Authorities say they believe they have found the
remains of a missing California man and it is almost certain he was
killed by a mountain lion in the remote desert of northern Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   A human skull believed to be that of Dennis Dorsey, 49, was
found Wednesday by deputies and tracking dogs in the rugged Owyhee
Desert, Elko County Sheriff Neil Harris said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said evidence at the scene indicated Dorsey had been
attacked and killed by a mountain lion, numerous in that remote
wilderness, and that what was left by the big cat probably was
devoured by coyotes and other scavengers.
</P>
<P>
   Dorsey, of Walnut Creek, Calif., was on a 10-day fishing and
hiking trip when he vanished last month. He was last heard from on
the afternoon of Oct. 10 when he phoned his family from Orvada, a
desert town north of Winnemucca, Nev.
</P>
<P>
   Dorsey's abandoned sports utility vehicle was found Monday on an
old off-road trail 11 miles west of the mining town of Midas.
Harris said Dorsey's sleeping bag was still rolled and food in the
car was spoiled, indicating that he probably was attacked and
killed a day or two after his phone call.
</P>
<P>
   Shredded clothing and other personal items were found about 300
yards from Dorsey's car, Harris said, adding that the evidence
pointed to a mountain lion attack rather than a human one.
</P>
<P>
   The skull was discovered by deputies not far away from that
spot, the sheriff said. The skull and other effects were being sent
to California for identification.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said he knew of no other incident of a human being killed
by a mountain lion in his 28 years in law enforcement in Elko
County, the fifth largest and one of the most remote counties in
the nation. He said the rugged canyon and high desert country, a
mecca for wild game hunters, is abundantly populated by mountain
lions, bears and other predators.

QB DILEMMA PUTS PARCELLS AT A LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ He has searched endlessly for a quarterback
to replace Vinny Testaverde, who ruptured an Achilles' tendon on
opening day vs. the Patriots, shattering a promising season for the
Jets. Yet the search in his mind is short when coach Bill Parcells
is asked to identify the best quarterback in the league right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Performance-wise this year you'd have to put him right at the
top,'' said Parcells of Drew Bledsoe. ``I don't see anyone playing
better right now. You look at Drew and Peyton Manning, and I think
those other guys quickly come to mind for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Since that horrible 30-28 loss to New England, Parcells has been
trying to solve his quarterback riddle. He has been heavily
criticized in New York and nationally for not addressing the backup
quarterback issue after he had traded Glenn Foley to Seattle for a
draft pick. But Parcells didn't feel he could keep a $2
million-plus backup, given the Jets' salary cap woes. So he took a
chance. He brought in Scott Zolak, then cut him in camp. He decided
to risk that Tom Tupa would be an adequate backup and Ray Lucas
could emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Then he made his annual deal with Green Bay general manager Ron
Wolf, who sold him on Rick Mirer, the player Parcells almost took
ahead of Bledsoe in the '93 draft.
</P>
<P>
   When Testaverde went down, Parcells went from Tupa to Mirer, to
Lucas, back to Mirer, and now back to Lucas. Mirer went 2-4 during
his reign, but the Jets weren't scoring points. Mirer seemed
tentative, unable to get the ball to open receivers. The Mirer move
was made even though he led the team to a 12-7 win over Arizona
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the games we've been involved with have been undecided
in the very late portion of the game,'' said Parcells. ``All but
one went down to the last 3-4 minutes to determine the winner. You
always look at yourself and say `gee whiz, if we hadn't done this
or that.' But mostly we've lost because we haven't been able to
score enough points. Our turnover ratio is still on the plus side;
we don't have an inordinate imbalance in turnovers and takeaways
that you would have when you're losing. We're not highly penalized
although we've had a couple of critical penalties. We're not giving
the games away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most specifically, we haven't been able to execute well in the
passing game to create enough opportunity to win the game,''
Parcells said.
</P>
<P>
   So Lucas is the man. Most Patriots were surprised Parcells named
him the starter so early in the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just an effort to try to maybe score more points,'' he
said. ``We've been in the same pattern since Vinny got hurt. We
averaged 26 points a game last year and now we're down 11 points a
game to 15. You just can't win. You're not doing enough to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells knows he's taking a risk with Lucas, who is raw and
unproven. He figures Lucas may make more mistakes than Mirer, but
he may take more chances to win games, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to try and find that output,'' he said. ``Because on
the present course we're not scoring enough to win. so I think the
risk is worth it. If it doesn't work, I'm no worse off.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells does have a great running game. Curtis Martin has
strung together three consecutive 100-yard games when teams have
known the Jets are going to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just need much better balance,'' said Parcells. ``We need a
couple of big plays in the passing game. New England is a team that
can go on and maybe something doesn't happen for a while, but they
have the ability to make big plays in the passing game. Drew is
playing well, and the receivers he has, they can generate points by
doing that. That's where we're having a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   With his predicament, Parcells understands that it has become a
quarterback-driven league, though he sites examples of teams that
emphasize other things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think its happening in Miami,'' he said. ``There are a
couple of teams _ Jacksonville, really, if they were in the AFC
East, they would be more like Miami than New England. To me
offensively, they're not quite on par with other teams but their
defense is strong, and they do have a good running game. That's two
examples of teams in the AFC that kind of get away from that
quarterback high-powered offense theory, and they have the chance
to be in it at end. As does New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it is a quarterback-driven league. In the end it will
prove to be true. In the end you're going to face somebody you have
to score on to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells does not call this the most frustrating team he's
coached; that honor belongs to the Giants (3-12) of 1983, the first
year he coached in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've (the Jets' players) been receptive. They're working
pretty hard. We haven't always played well. I haven't had any
discipline problems or off-the-field stuff that accompanies losing
records. I wouldn't say it's frustrating, but I had a good team
coming out of training camp. It goes to show how fragile and
humbling this game can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to comment on Ben Coates's outburst, Parcells said, ``I
don't have any reaction to it because I don't know what the deal
is. He was really a developmental guy at the time. He came along so
quickly. He's blossomed into the best tight end that's ever played.
That tight end position, the fullback position where Sam Gash
played and still plays in Buffalo, and strong safety where Lawyer's
(Milloy) playing now _ the wear and tear on those three positions
is so different than any other position in football. Very seldom
are those guys out of the game. It's a high ratio of collisions.
That's the way Lawyer plays the strong safety position.''
</P>
<P>
   He will not commit to his coaching future with the Jets. There
are many factors involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't changed my view,'' he said. ``At the end of the year
I'll (evaluate). You hate to leave losing, but if I felt it was
time, it wouldn't have anything to do with it.''

MONTVILLE WEIGHS IN ON UPCOMING FIGHT

   Who is better than Sports Illustrated's Leigh Montville?
</P>
<P>
   His ``Viewpoint'' segment on CNN/SI is one of the best
commentaries on television.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what Montville, a former Boston Globe sports columnist,
has to say about the upcoming Holyfield-Lewis fight. ``Which
officials or promoters will be indicted? Who will be sued? Whose
purse will be held up by the Nevada State Athletic Commission? Will
Jim Gray be around, making a nuisance of himself? Ah, there's
nothing like a good heavyweight championship fight these days.
Outside of maybe a good bass-fishing tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Montville's colleague at CNN/SI, Nick Charles, said that Lewis
and Holyfield must deliver in the ring in order to restore a
modicum of respectability to the sport. ``It's amazing,'' Charles
said. ``Boxing keeps trying to kill itself, yet it won't die.
People are disgusted with what has happened in past fights. I still
think people will tune in and watch, but I do think it will be a
lower number. People are reluctant.''

Sox rights still in limbo &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations for the Red Sox television rights are inching
along. The major problem is that none of the potential television
carriers are prepared to lose millions of dollars on an inflated
product.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox are looking for at least $10.5 million in rights
fees, but the local television stations simply can't afford it,
especially considering the added $3 million in production and
talent costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd really like to make it work but we are in no position to
lose money,'' said Channel 38's Lee Kinberg, director of
programming.
</P>
<P>
   No one else is, either.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe Barry Diller. The media mogul wants to establish his
brand of local programming in Boston. He already owns Channel 66,
better known for its shopping programming than local news and
sports. Diller's strategy in Miami has been to obtain a sports
package and wrap local programming around it.
</P>
<P>
   Diller tied to acquire the Red Sox rights last year but the deal
fell through.
</P>
<P>
   In Diller's case, it might make sense to lose money in order to
gain name recognition by airing Red Sox games.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox brass like those kinds of people.
</P>
<P>
   They like them even better if they have guaranteed letters of
credit from a reputable bank.

</P>
<P>
   ESPN ratings are up so far this NFL season. Among the increases
is ``NFL Primetime,'' up 17 percent in viewership, from 2.853
million homes to 3.339 million, and 14 percent in ratings, from
3.80 to 4.34.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN's ``Sunday Night Football'' is averaging 6,401,066 homes
and an 8.32 rating, increases of 14 percent and 11 percent,
respectively, over this point last season. Last Sunday's telecast
of the Tennessee Titans at Miami Dolphins earned a 9.0 rating,
ESPN's fourth highest of the season. And last Saturday's Notre
Dame-Tennessee game on ESPN was the highest-rated and most-watched
college telecast (4.7 rating and 3.63 million homes) in two years.
</P>
<P>
   The big news from ESPN, however, is the phenomenal growth of its
on-line service. ESPN Internet Ventures registered more than 1.3
billion page views in October, a 236 percent increase over October
1998 and the first time any Internet sports entity attracted more
than a billion page views. The ESPN sites averaged 32 million page
views per day during the week of Oct. 17-23.

broadcast. Among the contestants are Dick and Rick Hoyt. Rick, 37,
has cerebral palsy and gets assistance from his 59-year-old father.
The elder Hoyt pulls his son in a boat for the 2.4-mile swim,
attaches a cart to the front of his bike for the 112-mile ride, and
pushes him in a special chair for the 26.2-mile marathon. This year
marked the Hoyts' 19th consecutive Boston Marathon appearance.
Another athlete is Kathleen Kinz-Smith, a 37-year-old mother of

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN, Mass. _ Bradley Dean was a ``beer swilling surfer''
struggling through high school when he first read a book by Henry
David Thoreau: the Cliff Notes version of ``Walden.'' He only got
serious about the famed naturalist and social critic when the Navy
threw him in the brig for refusing a haircut in 1974, and he took
solace in Thoreau's acid attacks on arbitrary authority.
</P>
<P>
   Now, this unlikely Thoreau scholar has done what once was
considered almost impossible: produced a ``new'' book by the great
Transcendentalist. By deciphering Thoreau's crimped handwriting and
reorganizing the jumbled manuscript, Dean has resurrected ``Wild
Fruits,'' the ambitious book Thoreau was working on when he died of
tuberculosis in 1862.
</P>
<P>
   The book _ a scientific yet almost religious look at the nuts
and berries in Thoreau's Concord _ puts Dean at the center of a
seismic shift in the way scholars view Thoreau, once regarded as a
man whose career declined after ``Walden'' was published in 1854.
Thoreau's real problem, says Dean, is that he died at 44 before he
could finish the project of which ``Wild Fruits'' is part.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to kind of revolutionize Thoreau studies because
it presents a guy who was not only being creative throughout his
life, but also a guy who had an almost unbelievable ambition,''
said Dean, resident scholar at the Thoreau Institute supported by
rock star Don Henley.
</P>
<P>
   The book, the second Thoreau manuscript that Dean has prepared
for publication since 1993, cements his rise from the Navy brig to
the Tudor mansion near Walden Pond where the Thoreau Institute
resides. The first book, ``Faith in a Seed,'' was widely praised by
reviewers, but the less technical ``Wild Fruits'' is expected to
reach a broader audience.
</P>
<P>
   Though Dean's doctorate is in American literature, his
contribution seems more like detective work, including a rare
ability to reconstruct the order of Thoreau's notes using
indicators as subtle as the pattern of tear marks made by Thoreau's
push pins.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a completely obsessive personality that works extremely
well in this field,'' said Ronald Hoag, a Thoreau scholar at East
Carolina University in North Carolina, where Dean formerly taught.
</P>
<P>
   Early reviewers say ``Wild Fruits'' compares with Thoreau's best
work in passages, such as his account of cranberry picking, in
which he argues that God resides in the commonplace. ``It would
imply the regeneration of mankind if they were to become elevated
enough to truly worship sticks and stones,'' he writes. ``If I
could, I would worship the parings of my nails.''
</P>
<P>
   However, in the hothouse world of analyzing an American icon
like Thoreau, Dean faces criticism, too. Leo Marx, a prominent
Thoreau scholar at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
argues that Dean's resurrection of Thoreau manuscripts is a veiled
attempt to advance radical environmentalism.
</P>
<P>
   In the New York Review of Books last summer, Marx writes that
``Faith in a Seed'' offers little that is new, except to organize
previously known writing into an attack on human domination of the
environment, which Marx calls ``ecocentrism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a significant work not so much for any literary merit it
may have (slight, in my opinion) as for the light it throws on the
current effort to re-evaluate Thoreau's work from an ecocentric
point of view,'' writes Marx.
</P>
<P>
   But others, such as Thoreau biographer Robert D. Richardson Jr.,
believe the new books showcase Thoreau as a great scientist, in
addition to his more recognized gifts, showing that, in the last
years of his life, Thoreau anticipated Charles Darwin's theory of
evolution as well as modern ecology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thoreau has become a much bigger subject in the history of
science'' in part because of Dean's work, said Richardson. ``Forty
years ago, scientists would sort of snicker about him as a
naturalist,'' but now they take his findings more seriously.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is the legacy of a man whose sharply observed, clever
writings have inspired people across a remarkable range of
endeavors from civil rights leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr.
to Depression Era labor activists to modern environmentalists such
as Rachel Carson.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Thoreau's reputation rested heavily on two
books, ``Walden'' and ``Civil Disobedience,'' both drawn from
experiences in the 1840s. ``Walden,'' an account of living alone at
the edge of a Concord pond for two years, set out Thoreau's rules
for good living, including healthy doses of nature as well as
moralizing. ``Civil Disobedience,'' based on Thoreau's one-night
jailing for refusing to pay a tax on voting, argues that, if a law
is unjust, ``then, I say, break the law.''
</P>
<P>
   After 1850, however, Thoreau's writing began to change, becoming
increasingly scientific and focusing on ecological processes such
as the way forests grow back over untended meadows or the minutiae
of the change of seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people dismiss the final years of Thoreau as his turn
toward science and his dropping of weighty philosophical thought,
whereas Brad (Dean) and other people argue there's a lot more
there,'' said David Foster, author of ``Thoreau's Country,'' which
relies heavily on the later writings to describe the mid-19th
century landscape.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the last 25 years have been preparing Dean to make
his case for Thoreau. Dean's reading of Thoreau while in the Navy _
both in and out of the brig _ transformed him from an indifferent
student and sometime troublemaker to a Thoreau disciple, including
a 900-page masters thesis on ``Life Without Principle,'' a Thoreau
essay he had quoted at his court-martial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I owed Thoreau a big one,'' said Dean, 45, and still something
of a rebel with his ponytail and Harley-Davidson motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
   Dean believes Thoreau, if anything, improved as a thinker after
``Walden,'' undertaking a massive course of science reading and
field observations in Concord. After exalting nature as an ideal,
Thoreau was trying to understand how nature worked at a level of
detail few had even imagined, Dean said.
</P>
<P>
   But a key part of Dean's proof, the ``Wild Fruits'' manuscript,
was in such bad shape that other scholars had given up on it.
</P>
<P>
   Though the dying Thoreau had neatly bundled up the 600-page
manuscript, over the generations, the pages were shuffled
completely out of order, winding up in the Berg Collection of the
New York Public Library in the 1940s. There it sat, known to
scholars but hardly mentioned in biographies such as Richardson's
``Henry Thoreau: A Life of the Mind'' in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, Dean _ so obsessive that he still has the Cliff
Notes of Walden he read as a teenager _ was the right candidate for
the restoration. Immersing himself in Thoreau's writing, reading
the books Thoreau read, wandering the places Thoreau went, living
at the institute, Dean slowly put the manuscript back to the way
the dying Thoreau left it.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a single-volume fragment of what Dean believes was
intended as perhaps a four or five volume set. Some of the 181
different fruits described receive little more than a sentence, and
perhaps half the material had been published in other forms before
by other editors, but the book's organization casts even published
material as part of a larger scheme.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to scientific observations, Dean sees a less dour,
less judgmental Thoreau, more eager to celebrate nature in ``Wild
Fruits'' than in earlier works. ``If you read ``Walden,'' you come
across this austere, somewhat intimidating guy that preaches at
you. You don't like him a lot,'' said Dean. ``In a sense, it is a
more humble man you encounter here.''
</P>
<P>
   In Dean's view, Thoreau had found his way at the end, not lost
it, as critics once believed. As Thoreau wrote in a letter just six
weeks before he died: ``If I were to live, I should have much to
report on Natural History generally.''

SOUTHERN YELLOW PINE GAINS IN USE, STILL HARD TO FIND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, November 14, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am restoring the woodwork in my two-family house built in
1925. The woodwork is good looking, but some of it needs replacing,
and it has a nice dark orangey finish and color. Someone told me it
is hard pine (Southern yellow pine). Where can I find it? The big
lumber stores look at me as if I was nuts.
</P>
<P>
   FRANK CONNORS, Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Nuts you are not. Some of those stores just don't want to be
bothered. Yes, that is Southern yellow pine; it was used in the
early part of the waning century, and earlier, but lost favor when
white pine and other kinds of pine were marketed. In fact, I was
doing an interview last week at the Fisher School (circa 1845) in
Westwood, and my goodness, the floors were Southern yellow pine,
and new pieces were used to fill in.
</P>
<P>
   It is available; in fact there is a heavy revival of Southern
yellow pine, pushed by the lumbermen who are harvesting it.
</P>
<P>
   Lumber stores that carry hardwoods and exotic woods also may
carry Southern yellow pine, even though it is called hard, it is
not classed as a hardwood: Rooney, Somerville, 617-666-4030.
Leonard Lumber Co., Branford, Conn., 269-2626, 269-2775.
Henderson's Hardwoods, King St., Hanson, Mass.; Cambridge Lumber &AMP;
Supply, 617-876-4460.
</P>
<P>
   Also, you could call the Southern Pine Council to find out where
it is sold locally: Kenner, La., 504-443-4464, or Forest Park, Ga.,
404-361-1445.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I found some very old liquid in a can, although I could not
open the can that has a ``push down and twist'' cap. It is called
Ditzler alkyd enamel reducer, made for automotive finishes. What is
it, and is there any use I could put to it? Or should I recycle it?
</P>
<P>
   BARBARA CHOLAKOS, Arlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It sounds like a fancy word for paint thinner, a thinner for
an oil-based (alkyd) enamel. Since it is for automotive enamels, it
might be lacquer thinner, which is extremely volatile and difficult
to use safely. At any rate, since we don't know for sure what it is
(``reducer'' is as vague or generalized a word as sealer or
thinner), and since it is old, I suggest you take it to the next
hazardous waste collection.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My cedar fence is three or four years old, is gray and looks
lovely. My husband feels it should be sealed. Is that really
necessary?
</P>
<P>
   C. M., Milton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Not at all. Many people, including your husband, have been
brainwashed or propagandized by manufacturers who say that outdoor
wood that is not painted should or must be sealed to make it water
resistant, so water will bead up on it instead of soaking in (to
rot the wood). Their admonitions (with the threat of decay and
other disasters) apply to any kind of wood, even pressure-treated
wood, in any application (vertical or horizontal). They don't tell
you that these sealers must be reapplied once a year. They don't
tell you that semitransparent stain will work better and will last
for three to five years. They don't tell you that it is not
necessary in many cases.
</P>
<P>
   They do have a point in some cases, such as with
pressure-treated deck floor boards; sealing them will help prevent
their warping, spalling, splitting, and splintering.
</P>
<P>
   As for your fence, it is white cedar, has already weathered to
the gray color you so admire, and will continue to weather without
ill effect or treatment of any kind. If this fence gets wet and
dries out between wettings, it will last indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   You and your husband can do more interesting things than spend
money on sealing something that does not need sealing.
</P>
<P>
   And don't let anyone tell you that sealing the cedar will help
reduce mold and algae from growing on it. It won't. The handyman's
white cedar high picket fence is many years old, untreated, and is
a nice, weathered, silver color. It does have some black (mold) and
green (algae) stains, but they can be treated with bleach and
water, when the handyman gets around to it. One thing about mold
and algae: They should be killed and removed occasionally with the
bleach and water solution because left on wood, they can cause the
wood to decay.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Help! My concrete-block foundation has developed pebble-itis,
the pebbles in the blocks showing more than they should. How can I
cover the pebbles and smooth out the concrete?
</P>
<P>
   M. B., Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. To cure the pebble-itis, which is caused by water running
down the face of the blocks, try this: Apply a bonding agent to the
existing blocks and then apply a thin layer of mortar. It is called
parging, and should help a lot, but the bonding agent is essential
to prevent that thin coat of mortar from sloughing off.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative is this (it will not cover the pebbles but will
make the concrete more resistant to water and erosion): Apply a
coat of cement-based paint (no other paint will do). This is a
powder that is mixed with water and brushed onto the concrete with
a heavy brush.

MARY, MOTHER OF JESUS 
Starring: Pernilla August, Christian Bale, Geraldine Chaplin 
Directed by: Kevin Connor 
On: NBC 
Time: Sunday at 9 p.m. 
Rated: 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some of the ads for ``Mary, Mother of Jesus'' use a cover
version of the Beatles' ``Let It Be'' for their soundtrack. It's
perfect: ``When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary
comes to me, speaking words of wisdom . . .''
</P>
<P>
   And you can bet NBC executives were pleased that it was the
honorable Sir Paul McCartney who paid homage to the Blessed Virgin
Mother, and not John Lennon, the fiesty bloke who once said about
his band, ``We're more popular than Jesus now; I don't know which
will go first _ rock 'n' roll or Christianity.'' Because this
made-for-TV movie is in no way an attempt to rock the Old Testament
with desert-chic hair styles, or to challenge our understanding of
the story of Christ with revisionist assertions. ``Mary, Mother of
Jesus,'' which airs Sunday, is a safe, reverential portrait of the
most worshiped woman of all time, a movie created solely to
celebrate the role she played in her son's life, death, and
resurrection. ``Everything he is, you made him,'' a dying Joseph
says to Mary, articulating the not-so-subtle gist of the project.
It's cynicism-free TV, and it plays more like Sunday-morning
religious programming than most of what airs in prime time these
days.
</P>
<P>
   The smartest decision by the ``Mary'' filmmakers, including
executive producers Eunice Kennedy Shriver and her son, Bobby
Shriver, was to keep ``Mary'' from becoming a star vehicle. You
know, Cher is Mary. As their lead, they chose Swedish actress
Pernilla August, best known in the States as Anakin Skywalker's
mother in ``The Phantom Menace.'' August is terrifically stoic and
dignified throughout, glowing with pride and faith in her son even
when he briefly turns his back on her. And she is equally able to
convey profound grief during the scenes when she must watch him
die. The filmmakers also wisely opt for a plain, earthy-looking
production, without any of the slickness and special effects
overkill that are so identified with today's sweeps TV-movie
events.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Mary'' fails as drama on a number of important counts, and
I can't recommend it for those seeking anything more than a sketchy
religious primer. For one thing, the script is stilted and
overflowing with cliches, from the opening ``The Romans are coming,
the Romans are coming'' to Mary's pledge, once Herod has the baby
boys in Bethlehem murdered, that, ``As long as I have breath in my
body, God help me, this child shall live.'' Such lines are meant to
sound authentically biblical, but they are bland and stiff, and
they are awkwardly interrupted by contemporary turns of phrase like
``Why are you always so stuck-up and superior?'' The script doesn't
endow the familiar sacred story, or Jesus himself, with much
complexity or vitality.
</P>
<P>
   The pacing of ``Mary'' is also off, particularly in the latter
half, when the movie should get a speeding ticket for rushing
through Jesus's adult career and crucifixion in under an hour. To
meet its epic ambition of portraying two major figures, the movie
probably needed more than two commercial-heavy TV hours to be
anything more than superficial. They wouldn't have improved the
dialogue, but another two hours might have allowed time to pursue
the bond between Mary and Mary Magdalene, for instance, which is
repeatedly suggested but never explored.
</P>
<P>
   We can only hope the networks' religious fervor (``Noah's Ark''
and ``Joan of Arc'' were ratings hits) will provide us with a more
dynamic interpretation of the Bible next spring. CBS airs its
``Jesus'' in May, and ABC brings us ``The Miracle Maker'' in April.

`FINDING NORTH' GETS LOST ALONG THE WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
FINDING NORTH 
Directed by: Tanya Wexler 
Written by: Kim Powers 
Starring: Wendy Makkena and John Benjamin Hickey 
Running time: 95 minutes 
Rating: Unrated 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Finding North'' opens with a forlorn young man, Travis Furlong
(John Benjamin Hickey), naked, perched on the edge of a bridge in
New York, looking longingly into the river, and Rhonda Portelli
(Wendy Makkena) stuck in traffic behind all the commotion. They
don't meet that night _ though she recovers a shoe he left behind
(hello, Cinderella) _ but rest assured, they will. It's not giving
away too much to say that Furlong does not jump, and it's probably
not going to be the biggest shocker of the day to surmise they will
have nothing in common. He's gay but despondent; his lover has just
died from AIDS, and he wants nothing more than to join him in the
endless sleep. She's straight, 30, a bank teller, living in
Brooklyn with her Jewish-Italian parents, being nagged to death for
a lack of husband and other perceived failures.
</P>
<P>
   And so, the stage is set for yet another UBM _ Unlikely Buddy
Movie. They bicker and they bond, bit by bit, and then they bicker
again and they bond a little more and then . . .
</P>
<P>
   Travis and Rhonda have two semi-humorous close encounters
post-bridge before they finally connect. He can't figure out for
the life of him what she wants to do with him, being suicidal, gay
and all. She accepts the gay part, but not the suicidal part. Her
life having bottomed out at the bank, she joins him on a trip
through rural Texas. It seems Travis's dead lover, Bobby Sullivan,
has mailed him an audio tape that arrives posthumously. Bobby says
that in lieu of the joint trip they were going to take to Bobby's
hometown, he should go it alone and discover his roots. Also, he
implies, there's a mission involved, a scavenger hunt of sorts.
This puts a crimp in Travis's suicide plans, but he figures he'll
do it later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finding North'' does have a certain sweetness about it, traces
of knowing dark humor. Some of the situations bring a smile. But
Travis's journey through Bobby's boyhood moves at a snail's pace
and director Tanya Wexler's frequent cuts to Rhonda's parents on
the couch watching TV may drive you as crazy as they drive Rhonda.
This film's semi-edge dissipates as it nears the inevitable climax.
``Finding North,'' by the way, was Bobby's expression for when
things have gone so far to south, a.k.a. hell, all one can do is
try and find north. Which is fair enough, but by the end we don't
care at all.

BASS TOURNEY KEEPS AT LEAST ONE RIVETED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I &UR;  &LR; guess maybe it's just not a New England thing.
</P>
<P>
   See, there I was last Sunday afternoon, sitting on my couch,
beverage within reach, all atwitter with expectation. In fact, I
was a bundle of nerves.
</P>
<P>
   Could the Fox network really pull it off? Televise the first
live bass fishing tournament in TV history and make it interesting?
</P>
<P>
   I had asked several of my friends if they wanted to watch it
with me, friends with whom I have watched baseball and football,
friends with whom I have sailed and fished and shot ducks.
</P>
<P>
   They were all busy.
</P>
<P>
   One said he was going fishing. One said he was going hunting.
One said he had to go to a neighborhood lawn tractor rodeo for a
Very Worthy Charity.
</P>
<P>
   Another said he had his Waylon Jennings albums all mixed up with
Jerry Jeff Walker, and he had put aside the time last Sunday to
sort them out.
</P>
<P>
   So I was going through my butterfly time leading up to the
beginning of the M1 Millennium Fishing Tournament all alone. Just
me, my beverage, and my Maine Coon cat, Pink Floyd, dozing beside
me.
</P>
<P>
   So why all the nerves? Well, when the sports beat you have
covered for decades as an outdoor writer finally breaks into the
big time, you can't avoid feeling a bit responsible for what folks
are about to see, and the impression big-time televised fishing
makes on them.
</P>
<P>
   After all, when you talk up fishing for so many years you're
preaching to the converted. But now, right there, on one of the
major networks, a live fishing tournament . . . What would happen?
</P>
<P>
   Now, on one channel Tiger Woods was making golf history, and on
another the Lions and Rams were locked up in a potboiler. Brian
Boitano and a cast of former skating greats were swirling on
another, and there was a NASCAR race on.
</P>
<P>
   So how many people would be left to watch the fishing derby
anyway?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, everyone just surfing channels has come across those
canned fishing shows at some point on a Saturday morning. But Fox
had something far different in mind. Teaming up with Operation Bass
at Cyprus Gardens, Fla., this show required a cast of hundreds and
a production investment of half a million bucks _ about what it
costs to televise an NFL game.
</P>
<P>
   And then it was on, complete with an anchor desk high over the
Cyprus Gardens lakes _ where all the championship waterskiing is
filmed _ and a team of fishing broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, two of them were baseball broadcasters, Joe Buck and
Bob Brenley. The guest analyst was Forrest Wood, founder of Ranger
Boats, which, festooned in advertising logos, zipped around those
lakes at about 70 miles per hour. It would seem with a
250-horsepower power plant screaming across the water, any fish
within 2 miles would have figured it was the end of the world and
made a suicidal leap onto the shore.
</P>
<P>
   (Note to self: Find out why those anglers need to go so fast,
anyway.)
</P>
<P>
   Like a golf tournament, the fishing was to feature 10 anglers
who would be shown fishing live, with tapes of their earlier
catches that day woven throughout the presentation.
</P>
<P>
   In their utter determination not to let the show drag,
Intrasport, which produced the show for Fox, went a bit the other
way.
</P>
<P>
   With live shots, taped shots, one angler after another with bio
spots, and at least one angler appearing on a recurring commercial,
it became increasingly difficult to sort things out.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter, if you got a little confused in places, you'd
then see a shot of one of those high-powered Rangers flying over
the lake, and you knew what that was about _ an image aimed right
at the 12-year-old in all of us.
</P>
<P>
   The finale, which had been touted all day, got a little frantic.
After all the anglers sped to the weigh-in center, each one was
called to the podium with a shopping bag full of fish.
</P>
<P>
   (Note to self: Find out how, if the anglers were spread out over
five lakes, they all roared into the same weigh-in center and
parked their Rangers in that round dock.)
</P>
<P>
   It was like the game of blackjack when you keep one card face
down until the money's on the table, then turn it over.
</P>
<P>
   Each angler held one last fish in the bag (immersed so as not to
kill the fish), and his last act of the day was to pull the last
fish out of the bag and put it on the scale.
</P>
<P>
   Which was a spectacle in itself. The emcee would put the
flapping fish in a box on the scale, then jam a plastic top down to
keep it still. This created a remarkable flashback to the Dan
Akroyd Bassamatic skit on ``Saturday Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Darrell Robertson from Jay, Okla., pulled out the
winning fish and picked up a check for $600,000, part of a $3.6
million purse, the largest in fishing history.
</P>
<P>
   Well, again, it just isn't a New England sort of thing.
</P>
<P>
   Here, where fishing is about cool bubbling streams and canoes,
or about turning off the motor and drifting saltwater flies through
a rip, the pro bass scene just doesn't satisfy that thirst for
kicking back in the wilderness and watching the summer clouds drift
by.
</P>
<P>
   Tournament fishing in New England is about a place to bring one
good catch, meet with fellow anglers, drink beer, and tell lies.
The secrecy about hot spots along the surf is a matter of stealth
and stillness.
</P>
<P>
   But while New England anglers may have been a bit nonplussed by
a bass derby in Florida, when I next got to the office, all the
editors and sportswriters who regularly cover _ ah _ mainstream
sports were going wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow, was that cool!'' one of them said. ``I love how they
pulled out those fish (at the weigh-in).''
</P>
<P>
   Said another: ``That guy (Robertson) was fishing in pain. He had
just passed a kidney stone the day before. Amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   And a Globe columnist was on the verge of writing an angry
commentary on the fact that if all the anglers were on five
different lakes, the playing field was inconsistent. He was
steamed.
</P>
<P>
   ``And those killer boats,'' said another, ``and those bags of
fish hiding what was coming next . . . that was way cool.''
</P>
<P>
   (Note to self: Better find out what happened during the 15
minutes you switched channels to watch that Lions drive.)

 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN, Mass. _ Bradley Dean was a ``beer swilling surfer''
struggling through high school when he first read a book by Henry
David Thoreau: the Cliff Notes version of ``Walden.'' He only got
serious about the famed naturalist and social critic when the Navy
threw him in the brig for refusing a haircut in 1974, and he took
solace in Thoreau's acid attacks on arbitrary authority.
</P>
<P>
   Now, this unlikely Thoreau scholar has done what once was
considered almost impossible: produced a ``new'' book by the great
Transcendentalist. By deciphering Thoreau's crimped handwriting and
reorganizing the jumbled manuscript, Dean has resurrected ``Wild
Fruits,'' the ambitious book Thoreau was working on when he died of
tuberculosis in 1862.
</P>
<P>
   The book _ a scientific yet almost religious look at the nuts
and berries in Thoreau's Concord _ puts Dean at the center of a
seismic shift in the way scholars view Thoreau, once regarded as a
man whose career declined after ``Walden'' was published in 1854.
Thoreau's real problem, says Dean, is that he died at 44 before he
could finish the project of which ``Wild Fruits'' is part.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to kind of revolutionize Thoreau studies because
it presents a guy who was not only being creative throughout his
life, but also a guy who had an almost unbelievable ambition,''
said Dean, resident scholar at the Thoreau Institute supported by
rock star Don Henley.
</P>
<P>
   The book, the second Thoreau manuscript that Dean has prepared
for publication since 1993, cements his rise from the Navy brig to
the Tudor mansion near Walden Pond where the Thoreau Institute
resides. The first book, ``Faith in a Seed,'' was widely praised by
reviewers, but the less technical ``Wild Fruits'' is expected to
reach a broader audience.
</P>
<P>
   Though Dean's doctorate is in American literature, his
contribution seems more like detective work, including a rare
ability to reconstruct the order of Thoreau's notes using
indicators as subtle as the pattern of tear marks made by Thoreau's
push pins.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a completely obsessive personality that works extremely
well in this field,'' said Ronald Hoag, a Thoreau scholar at East
Carolina University in North Carolina, where Dean formerly taught.
</P>
<P>
   Early reviewers say ``Wild Fruits'' compares with Thoreau's best
work in passages, such as his account of cranberry picking, in
which he argues that God resides in the commonplace. ``It would
imply the regeneration of mankind if they were to become elevated
enough to truly worship sticks and stones,'' he writes. ``If I
could, I would worship the parings of my nails.''
</P>
<P>
   However, in the hothouse world of analyzing an American icon
like Thoreau, Dean faces criticism, too. Leo Marx, a prominent
Thoreau scholar at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
argues that Dean's resurrection of Thoreau manuscripts is a veiled
attempt to advance radical environmentalism.
</P>
<P>
   In the New York Review of Books last summer, Marx writes that
``Faith in a Seed'' offers little that is new, except to organize
previously known writing into an attack on human domination of the
environment, which Marx calls ``ecocentrism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a significant work not so much for any literary merit it
may have (slight, in my opinion) as for the light it throws on the
current effort to re-evaluate Thoreau's work from an ecocentric
point of view,'' writes Marx.
</P>
<P>
   But others, such as Thoreau biographer Robert D. Richardson Jr.,
believe the new books showcase Thoreau as a great scientist, in
addition to his more recognized gifts, showing that, in the last
years of his life, Thoreau anticipated Charles Darwin's theory of
evolution as well as modern ecology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thoreau has become a much bigger subject in the history of
science'' in part because of Dean's work, said Richardson. ``Forty
years ago, scientists would sort of snicker about him as a
naturalist,'' but now they take his findings more seriously.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is the legacy of a man whose sharply observed, clever
writings have inspired people across a remarkable range of
endeavors from civil rights leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr.
to Depression Era labor activists to modern environmentalists such
as Rachel Carson.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Thoreau's reputation rested heavily on two
books, ``Walden'' and ``Civil Disobedience,'' both drawn from
experiences in the 1840s. ``Walden,'' an account of living alone at
the edge of a Concord pond for two years, set out Thoreau's rules
for good living, including healthy doses of nature as well as
moralizing. ``Civil Disobedience,'' based on Thoreau's one-night
jailing for refusing to pay a tax on voting, argues that, if a law
is unjust, ``then, I say, break the law.''
</P>
<P>
   After 1850, however, Thoreau's writing began to change, becoming
increasingly scientific and focusing on ecological processes such
as the way forests grow back over untended meadows or the minutiae
of the change of seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people dismiss the final years of Thoreau as his turn
toward science and his dropping of weighty philosophical thought,
whereas Brad (Dean) and other people argue there's a lot more
there,'' said David Foster, author of ``Thoreau's Country,'' which
relies heavily on the later writings to describe the mid-19th
century landscape.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the last 25 years have been preparing Dean to make
his case for Thoreau. Dean's reading of Thoreau while in the Navy _
both in and out of the brig _ transformed him from an indifferent
student and sometime troublemaker to a Thoreau disciple, including
a 900-page masters thesis on ``Life Without Principle,'' a Thoreau
essay he had quoted at his court-martial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I owed Thoreau a big one,'' said Dean, 45, and still something
of a rebel with his ponytail and Harley-Davidson motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
   Dean believes Thoreau, if anything, improved as a thinker after
``Walden,'' undertaking a massive course of science reading and
field observations in Concord. After exalting nature as an ideal,
Thoreau was trying to understand how nature worked at a level of
detail few had even imagined, Dean said.
</P>
<P>
   But a key part of Dean's proof, the ``Wild Fruits'' manuscript,
was in such bad shape that other scholars had given up on it.
</P>
<P>
   Though the dying Thoreau had neatly bundled up the 600-page
manuscript, over the generations, the pages were shuffled
completely out of order, winding up in the Berg Collection of the
New York Public Library in the 1940s. There it sat, known to
scholars but hardly mentioned in biographies such as Richardson's
``Henry Thoreau: A Life of the Mind'' in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, Dean _ so obsessive that he still has the Cliff
Notes of Walden he read as a teenager _ was the right candidate for
the restoration. Immersing himself in Thoreau's writing, reading
the books Thoreau read, wandering the places Thoreau went, living
at the institute, Dean slowly put the manuscript back to the way
the dying Thoreau left it.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a single-volume fragment of what Dean believes was
intended as perhaps a four or five volume set. Some of the 181
different fruits described receive little more than a sentence, and
perhaps half the material had been published in other forms before
by other editors, but the book's organization casts even published
material as part of a larger scheme.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to scientific observations, Dean sees a less dour,
less judgmental Thoreau, more eager to celebrate nature in ``Wild
Fruits'' than in earlier works. ``If you read ``Walden,'' you come
across this austere, somewhat intimidating guy that preaches at
you. You don't like him a lot,'' said Dean. ``In a sense, it is a
more humble man you encounter here.''
</P>
<P>
   In Dean's view, Thoreau had found his way at the end, not lost
it, as critics once believed. As Thoreau wrote in a letter just six
weeks before he died: ``If I were to live, I should have much to
report on Natural History generally.''

BCS POLL PROCESS NEEDS OVERHAUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The numbers were released on Monday afternoon. No. 1 in the Bowl
Championship Series rankings? Florida State. No surprise there. The
Seminoles were unbeaten, untied, and had not played a game the
previous week.
</P>
<P>
   No. 2? Tennessee. No. 3? Virginia Tech. Excuse me. Tech had not
lost a game, Tennessee had. Tech had won on Saturday, albeit a
last-second win over lightly regarded West Virginia. Tennessee had
won at home, rolling over Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   So the numbers came up and leapfrogged the Volunteers over the
Hokies. Explanation? Strength of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's was tougher, much tougher, said the computers.
</P>
<P>
   So what do we have? A controversy. An embarrassment? A bad
system?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is D. None of the above.
</P>
<P>
   There is no controversy because right now the numbers are for
entertainment purposes only. No one has been hurt, no one has been
shut out of playing in the BCS title game in the Sugar Bowl in New
Orleans Jan. 4. It's clearly a no-harm, no-foul situation _ right
now.
</P>
<P>
   Embarrassment? Sorry. In a weekly poll situation, Florida State
and Tennessee are probably the two best teams in the country right
now.
</P>
<P>
   A bad system? Not really. It's better than it was, but not as
good as it should be.
</P>
<P>
   But there is something that needs to be corrected, sooner rather
than later.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are gathered by the Southeastern Conference office,
which compiles the data and releases the weekly poll.
</P>
<P>
   The people in the BCS say this is no big deal. SEC commissioner
and BCS chairman Roy Kramer and his staff are merely dispensers of
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a problem with it,'' said Big Ten commissioner
Jim Delany, whose league is part of the BCS arrangement. ``And I
don't think anyone else involved with this does, either. It's just
numbers. There's nothing subjective about it.''
</P>
<P>
   And we're not going to question the integrity of Mr. Kramer, who
jokingly has said he has been blamed for everything from El Nino to
the rise and fall of the Dow Jones average in the past year the SEC
office has been handling the poll.
</P>
<P>
   But what is wrong with this picture?
</P>
<P>
   There is more than a good possibility that the BCS title game
could be a rematch of Tennessee-Florida.
</P>
<P>
   For that to happen, Tennessee must win its final three
regular-season games, Florida must beat Florida State at home and
win the SEC title game, Miami or BC must beat Virginia Tech at
home, and Nebraska must beat Kansas State at home.
</P>
<P>
   None of those _ maybe BC beating Tech _ is a totally
off-the-wall possibility.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems obvious that the commissioner of the SEC can't be
announcing numbers that could put two of his teams _ for a payout
of approximately $18 million _ into the championship game.
</P>
<P>
   How difficult would it be to have some accounting firm in a
place like New York, where they don't really care about college
football, handle the administration of the BCS poll each week?
</P>
<P>
   Delany and Kramer argue that there is no problem because it is
strictly a bookkeeping arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   But those numbers come from somewhere. They come from computers,
which are programmed by people who tell the computers what numbers
are important and what numbers aren't.
</P>
<P>
   They come from formulas created by people who tell the computers
that Tennessee beating Notre Dame by 24 points is better than
Tennessee beating Notre Dame by 17 points.
</P>
<P>
   And what isn't being said very much by anyone is that contrary
to the public stance (that No. 1 should meet No. 2), they are all
better served when that does not happen.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this. A championship game between unbeaten Kansas State
and unbeaten Virginia Tech, or a championship game between
once-beaten Florida and once-beaten Tennessee in the Sugar Bowl, a
match between once-beaten Florida State and unbeaten Virginia Tech
in the Orange Bowl, and unbeaten Kansas State and twice-beaten
Wisconsin in the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Which would create more controversy?
</P>
<P>
   Instead of interest in one game, you would create interest in
three BCS games. If Kansas State and Tech each won their games, you
would have controversy because both unbeaten teams would claim a
right to the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, which has all the BCS games, would love it. Ratings would
increase and everyone would make money.
</P>
<P>
   But that's another issue, for another time. Right now, we're in
the preliminary stages of what could be a huge mess.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are this all will work itself out with the next few
weeks of games.

<P>
   But one thing seems apparent. If the BCS rankings _ which now
have supplanted the AP and USA Today coaches poll in importance and
relevance _ are going to remain, they need to be distributed by
someone who does not have something to gain by them.

<P>
   Boston College fans need to be pulling for Pittsburgh to pull
off an upset of Notre Dame in Saturday's game at Pitt Stadium,
which will also be the last game played in that historic venue.
Here's why. Right now, the Big East has four guaranteed bowl slots:
BCS Bowl, Gator Bowl, Insight.Com Bowl, and Music City Bowl. It has
four teams which either are or should be bowl eligible: Virginia
Tech, Miami, Syracuse, and Boston College. In a perfect world, each
of those teams would be guaranteed a bowl game.
</P>
<P>
   But the Big East made a deal in which Notre Dame could fill any
of the non-BCS Bowl slots in any given season, with some
restrictions. The deal was made because two years ago the Big East
was coming off an 0-4 bowl season and was not in a position of
strength in its negotiations to get commitments from bowls. Adding
Notre Dame enabled the Big East to secure the bowl tie-ins.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame, however, must win two of its final three games to
become eligible. The Irish play Pitt Saturday, BC next week, and
finish with a road game at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating the Irish from bowl consideration would then
guarantee BC a slot even if it loses its remaining three games.
</P>
<P>
   BC, however, can take care of its own destiny with a win over
West Virginia. If the Eagles win that game, they should, at worst,
get one of the slots in the Music City Bowl _ against probably the
winner of the Kentucky-Vanderbilt game. A win in the final two
games of the season _ against Virginia Tech or Notre Dame _ could
send the Eagles to Jacksonville and the Gator Bowl, or Tucson and
the Insight.Com Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a remote possibility that if the Eagles were to
run the table and finish 9-2, they could wind up in the Fiesta
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, however, is that a win over the Mountaineers
will clinch a bowl bid for the Eagles.

   Davis NFL-bound?

   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised if Miami coach Butch Davis becomes the
hottest candidate among college coaches for any NFL openings that
develop. Davis has done a nice job in rebuilding Miami's program
and reputation. But Davis also is in the Tom Coughlin mind-set of a
few years ago. He is frustrated by the restrictions college coaches
face in recruiting, practicing, and everything else and he also
would like to see Miami improve its facilities. With background on
Jimmy Johnson's staff when he was with the Cowboys, Davis has an
NFL pedigree. It would not be outrageous to see the new Houston NFL
franchise make a run at Davis . . . Here's the latest oddity from
the Pac-10. Both Stanford and Arizona, regarded as the
front-runners for the league title at the start of the season,
might not garner enough wins to even qualify for a bowl game, much
less win the title. The Huskies must beat UCLA and Washington State
to get to the Rose Bowl.

NEW BULBS MERGE TECHNOLOGY, SCIENCE -- ATTRACT INVESTORS

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a world of digital cameras, digital telephones, and
even digital rice cookers, now comes the digital light bulb.
</P>
<P>
   What makes it digital is a tiny chip embedded in the bulb that
lets users generate one of 16.7 million hues at the touch of a
switch.
</P>
<P>
   The bulb is produced by Color Kinetics Inc., a Boston company
founded by two twentysomething entrepreneurs in the spare bedroom
of an apartment in the North End.
</P>
<P>
   Their tinkering seems to have paid off. The bulbs are displayed
in Disney theme parks, Boston Symphony Hall, and numerous retail
stores including Brookstone, Saks Fifth Avenue, and Nine West.
</P>
<P>
   Like moths to light, venture capitalists and other investors
have also been drawn to the company, pouring $12.5 million into the
two-year-old firm thus far.
</P>
<P>
   To them, Color Kinetics represents a new breed of technology
companies that marry old-fashioned technology with the kind of
science normally associated with hip Internet companies that have
lots of hype but little in the way of tangible products, said
George G. Mueller, the company's president and co-founder.
</P>
<P>
   ``What investors like about us is that we're a high-tech company
that has revenues, products, and patents. We're not an Internet
company that sells a hope and a prayer but has no revenues and
little long-term sustainability,'' said Mueller, a 29-year-old
graduate of Carnegie Mellon University who, ironically, founded a
thriving Internet company with his brother Gary in the mid-1990s.
That company, Internet Securities Inc. _ an economics research firm
the brothers sold 80 percent of in January for $43 million _ was
the subject of a Harvard Business School case study that has become
required reading for legions of budding entrepreneurs in business
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Mueller and his Color Kinetics co-founder, Ihor Lys, are
engineers who met at Carnegie Mellon while working together on a
robotics project. They came up with the idea of a digital light
bulb in 1993, said Lys, who is now 30. The project was put on hold
when Mueller dropped out of graduate school to found Internet
Securities with his brother in Boston. Mueller returned to the
light bulb idea in 1997, and the two entrepreneurs shipped their
first order of lights in September 1998. Though not yet profitable,
the company is expected to record sales of up to $7 million this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The company's offices have since moved out of Mueller's
apartment to new digs in Post Office Square, where the long-haired
entrepreneur gets the occassional odd look when he skateboards to
work. Mueller tries to infuse his company with the kind of
freewheeling culture normally associated with Internet companies.
The dress code is decidedly casual, and the reception area is
furnished with brightly colored bean bag chairs and is decorated
with a cardboard cutout of movie icon Austin Powers. To brainstorm,
Mueller often kicks a soccer ball around the office.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the trendy packaging, the science behind Color Kinetics'
digital lights is actually decades old. Each bulb is made up of
dozens of light emitting diodes, or LEDs, that have long been used
in clocks or as indicator lights on stereos and computers. But up
until the early 1990s, only green and red LEDs were available.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, blue LEDs were discovered, enabling a mixture of red,
green, and blue lights to produce a full spectrum of colors _ about
16.7 million hues, according to Lys, now Color Kinetics' chief
technical officer. Color Kinetics' LED bulbs, manufactured in
Hudson and Mansfield, can last 100,000 hours, as opposed to
traditional incandescent bulbs, which last about 1,000 hours.
Theoretically, an LED bulb can burn continually for 11.4 years.
</P>
<P>
   What Mueller and Lys added to this existing technology was the
ability to manipulate the light. They embedded a microchip in each
bulb and wrote software that allows users to change the color at
whim or program the bulbs to gradually change color over a set time
frame.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the ability to control colored lights is big
business for retailers who are continually searching for ways to
draw shoppers into their stores and keep them there long enough to
buy merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes back to the emotional value of how consumers react to
light,'' said Scott Swaebe, director of visual merchandising of
Brookstone Co. in Nashua. The national retailer is experimenting
with Color Kinetics lights in four prototype stores and is planning
to install the lights in all of its 198 Brookstone stores next
year. ``What's exciting about it is that you have the intrigue of
seeing that sign change color. Those that get it, you leave them
with something they'll remember. It also draws people into the
stores because the lights give them a warmer, more inviting feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Retail lighting is just the beginning, according to a June
report by Jesup &AMP; Lamont Securities Corp. in New York. LED lighting
is poised to take over the $10 billion commercial and residential
lighting market now dominated by halogen and incandescent lights.
</P>
<P>
   Before that happens, however, LED technology has to improve,
wrote Sean Chaitman, author of the Jesup &AMP; Lamont report. ``The
ability for LEDs to replace conventional white lighting will take
time. There are technological limitations, including brightness and
size,'' he wrote. ``Cost is also an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Lys acknowledges those downsides, noting that one of their
bulbs, a two-inch lamp called the iColor, produces just 2.5 watts
and costs $159 a bulb, not including the equipment required to
control the bulb. Lys says, however, he believes the future is
bright for LED technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The brightness will get better, and they'll only get more
efficient, which will help bring the prices down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brookstone's Swaebe said while prices are steep for Color
Kinetics' products, it hasn't deterred Brookstone from paying the
premium to distinguish its stores from others around them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at the mall the other day in one of our stores, and I
saw that no one else had any energy with their signs in terms of
moving color,'' he said. ``We're the first retailer that's going to
have this cool sign that's constantly changing color.''

TECHNOLOGY FIRING PUTNAM'S CYLINDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Technology can make most things perform better. We'd say that
includes the stock mutual funds at Putnam Investments lately.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Putnam's equity funds, which went through a period of
dull performance after their mid-1990s roar, are making noise again
in a stock market that has rewarded technology companies far above
all others.
</P>
<P>
   Putnam has a few blockbuster performance numbers to crow about
this year, including the 66 percent year-to-date gain in its $5
billion OTC Emerging Growth fund and the 40 percent advance of its
aggressive $2 billion Voyager II fund.
</P>
<P>
   But lots of fund companies have a few ultra-hot funds among
their offerings this year (Fidelity's Aggressive Growth had earned
over 62 percent for 1999 as of mid-week, when stablemate New
Millennium was up 54 percent).
</P>
<P>
   A better measure of Putnam's broad rebound can be found in its
overall performance compared with the nation's other top mutual
fund companies over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Putnam's 29.9 percent asset-weighted return for the year-long
period ended Sept. 30 ranked third among the big 10, according to
Kanon Bloch Carre, a mutual fund consulting firm in Boston.
Putnam's performance ranked eighth among the same group a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Putnam's few dazzling performers there is a cast of solid
funds as well. Two that prefer mid-sized companies have been strong
in 1999 so far: Voyager, which is up more than 26 percent, and
Vista, ahead by 22 percent. Growth Opportunities, which manages a
concentrated portfolio of large stocks, is up by 26 percent so far
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wind has been in our sails,'' said John Morgan Jr., a
managing director at Putnam and chief investment officer for its
global core and growth equities. ``But we've used the same
discipline we've always used.''
</P>
<P>
   Others agree Putnam's fund performance has more to do with a
market smiling on its investing strengths in technology and
mid-sized stocks than strategy shifts by its managers. Exhibit A:
the Nasdaq stock index's year-to-date gain of 45.8 percent through
Thursday, more than triple the performance of the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their product is geared toward where the success in the market
has been coming in at least the last year, but mainly the last few
months,'' said William Dougherty, president of Kanon Bloch Carre.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is no doubt Putnam funds have been building more
technology-focused portfolios in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Technology made up 22.2 percent of all Putnam's combined
domestic stock holdings on June 30, according to the Carson Group,
a New York firm that tracks institutional stock holdings. But that
figure soared to 28.9 percent by Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Putnam's tech portfolio had grown by $8.4 billion during the
quarter to a total of $56.7 billion. Financial stocks, the
second-largest investment group in the combined stock portfolios of
Putnam's mutual funds, amounted to $23.8 billion, according to
Carson.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan says part of the tech buildup is due to the appreciation
of stocks Putnam managers already owned and the migration of new
investor money into funds tilted toward technology.
</P>
<P>
   But we found little evidence of new money flooding Putnam's
hottest funds.
</P>
<P>
   The big and less aggressive Putnam Investors fund was the
company's 1999 best seller as of Sept. 30 with net sales of $3.6
billion through the nine months, according to Financial Research
Corp., a Boston investment data firm. Putnam Growth Opportunities
was second with net sales of about $2 billion, according to FRC.
</P>
<P>
   Though Putnam Investors ranks as one of the company's most
conservative growth funds, one third of its portfolio was made up
of technology investments on Sept. 30 (go-go OTC Emerging Growth
counts 59.9 percent of its portfolio as tech).
</P>
<P>
   In a stock market that seems to shower its affection on tech
investors at the expense of everyone else, Putnam certainly has
some funds that didn't make it to the party.
</P>
<P>
   Putnam's giant Growth and Income fund is up about 3.7 percent so
far this year, treading water at roughly the same rate as Putnam
Capital Appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   Putnam managers insist a range of performance numbers is part of
the package in their system that assigns different but strict
investment criteria for every fund and then makes managers stay in
their lanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we've done pretty well almost all across the board,''
said Morgan.

PricewaterhouseCoopers. And that's the bad news for the aspiring
dot-com CEOs. That same average Internet company chief owns 12.1
percent of the company, a holding worth $468.5 million.

SENIOR WORKER MAY WANT TO BUMP UP FIXED-INCOME HOLDINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, November 14, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am 62 and have recently been downsized. I am beginning to
face the reality that I won't be able to obtain decent employment.
I have decided to try to develop an income stream through
multilevel marketing, but I realize this will take time. I don't
want to apply for Social Security until age 65. My assets consist
of a $430,000 self-directed IRA, a $289,000 taxable trading
account, a $5,000 IRA in Janus Olympic, and $15,000 in cash. The
larger IRA has returned an average 18.3 percent over the past 10
years, and the trading account has averaged 24.09 percent. Both are
dominated by large-cap blue chip common stocks. My expenses are
approximately $40,000 a year after taxes. What changes in this
portfolio do you recommend to maintain the status quo until I reach
age 65?
</P>
<P>
   R.J., Wellesley, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I calculate a total of 26.7 percent of your total portfolio
on the fixed-income side, a figure that counts your preferred
stocks. Another calculation, based on a presumption of 6.5 percent
average returns from the fixed-income side and 2 percent from your
equity accounts, showed a total portfolio yield of $24,025, which
is probably about half of what you would need after paying your
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   You could make monthly withdrawals of $4,000 and stand still for
the next three years if you achieved total portfolio returns of 6.7
percent. In view of the good returns you have managed over the past
decade, that at first seems to be a pretty reasonable target. But
because so much of that growth was the result of capital
appreciation of your stocks, it's not the kind of thing I advise
planning on. I suggest you move about $200,000 from the stock
accounts within your IRA (or perhaps some from the taxable stock
holdings, if there are positions you could liquidate without
unpleasant tax consequences) to fixed-income holdings. This move
would boost your fixed-income position to about 53 percent of the
total portfolio, and increase the portfolio yield to $33,025.
</P>
<P>
   That would still leave you about $15,000 a year short of your
likely requirements. Given the uncertainties of your situation _
primarily that you might or might not realize a significant income
stream from your venture into self-employment _ I think I would
simply leave the balance of the portfolio as it is, withdrawing
money as needed from the tax-deferred stock accounts, calculating
that when your earned income begins coming in, and when Social
Security checks begin arriving, you can restore that element of the
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 26 and have yet to invest for my future. I have zero
debt and about $2,500 in my company's 410(k) plan. That is all I
have as far as investments go, but my employer just went public and
I now have $40,000 in cash from the sale of stock I had been given.
I would like to put that $40,000 somewhere and forget about it for
the next 30 years; I would like to be able to retire at age 56.
What do you suggest I do with the money?
</P>
<P>
   J.O., Jamaica Plain Mass.
</P>
<P>
   My suggestion would be that you make your investments by buying
variable annuity accounts, which will allow that 30-year
accumulation to occur on a tax-deferred basis. To do this within
the tax regulations, variable annuity accounts must include a very
small amount of insurance, which takes a tiny bite out of the
investment performance, but this is usually in the range of 1/2 of
1 percent a year, which in my view is a small price to pay for the
tax deferral.
</P>
<P>
   I suggest you put most of the money in a portfolio of Vanguard's
variable annuity accounts, with 60 percent in the Equity Index
account, which tracks the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500, and 20 percent
each in Vanguards Mid-Cap Index and Small Company variable
annuities.
</P>
<P>
   Why did I say put most of the money in variable annuity
accounts? Because there's an even more attractive investment
vehicle open to you, which is the Roth IRA. So I would hold $4,000
of the money aside, putting $2,000 of it in a Roth IRA for the tax
year 1999, and, after the start of the year, sending the remaining
$2,000 in as a Roth contribution for the year 2000. In both cases,
I'd just put it in the Vanguard Index 500. With the Roth IRA, the
money, and all of your investment returns, will be tax-free upon
withdrawal after age 59 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   If you achieved average annual returns of 10 percent from these
accounts over 30 years, the accumulation would be $697,976. This
represents a very nice start on a retirement nest egg, but its only
a start _ if inflation runs at an average 3.5 percent for 30 years,
that pool would have the buying power of a little less than
$250,000 in today's money. So its important that you keep plugging
away at the 401(k).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Through an inheritance, I will be receiving approximately
$125,000. My goal is to maximize my returns for retirement. I am 47
and earn $27,000 a year. I don't expect this to increase greatly in
the near future. My only savings is $8,000 in a brokerage account
invested in common stocks. On the advice of friends, I was planning
on opening an IRA, and possibly a Roth IRA. Should I focus on
mutual funds, CDs, or stocks?
</P>
<P>
   A.S., San Diego
</P>
<P>
   A. While you could open either a Roth or a traditional IRA, the
most you can contribute is $2,000 a year, so no more than $4,000 of
the money could go into IRA accounts within the next couple of
months _ $2,000 for the tax year 1999 and a further $2,000 for tax
year 2000. Since you will in all likelihood be in a lower tax
bracket in retirement than you are now, I would favor the
traditional IRA with its short-term tax break.
</P>
<P>
   The best vehicle for the remainder of the money is a variable
annuity, which will protect the accumulation from taxation until it
is withdrawn in retirement. And at that point, you would owe taxes
only on the percentage of the withdrawals that represent the
internal growth within the account, but not on the percentage that
represents your initial investment.
</P>
<P>
   As for the investment vehicle, I'd suggest a portfolio leaning
heavily on funds that track stock market indexes. I would stay away
from individual stocks because of the higher risks entailed in a
portfolio built on a few selected securities, and I would stay away
from CDs because they don't have enough risk _ and therefore don't
provide enough potential for the kind of growth you'll need to
build a satisfactory retirement pool.

ANDERSON HOLDS KEY TO SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Celtics seemed to be pointed in the right direction
before the final quarter of Wednesday's game against Detroit. Now,
Kenny Anderson wants to re-establish the team's sense of propriety
and purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who suffered a hip pointer after a collision with
Grant Hill, practiced only briefly Thursday but expects to start
against New York Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   After Anderson departed in the second quarter against the
Pistons, the Celtics struggled. They were outscored, 36-18, in the
fourth quarter of a 110-92 defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a matter of turnovers,'' coach Rick Pitino said.
``There were six 4-point swings, where turnovers led to easy
layups. That's 12 points in the first half alone. It was a close
game (in the second half) and we had two great shots in the lane,
we missed, and they got the ball and scored. We didn't run the fast
break well. We ran the fast break for jump shots rather than
layups. Whether Kenny was a factor in that . . . you've got to run
the break for layups.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson helped set the tone for the Celtics' fast start with a
purposeful attitude in the exhibition season. Anderson is
attempting to play a more substantive role in the direction of the
team. The Celtics won their first three games, and Anderson was a
key.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I fell like that I broke my wrist, in 1993,''
Anderson said about the collision Wednesday. ``It happens quick.
You look at it in slow motion and it looks harder than it really
is. But nothing is broken. It's a matter of how much pain I can
take and if I can be myself out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted to win the game and be out there for the team.
I couldn't be myself, I couldn't be aggressive and penetrate, be
speedy, and take advantage of the new rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be injured and sit out two games. It's not
only what I can do offensively. I want to be able to move and not
be a liability for my teammates defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   Dana Barros and Doug Overton filled the point guard role, but
Anderson's injury highlighted a Celtic vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   ``If their teams lost Grant Hill or Allen Iverson, they would
fall apart, too,'' Pitino said. ``Kenny is one of the premier
guards in the league. He is efficient in running the offense and
running the fast break. He gets where you have to go with the
basketball. He is a terrific offensive point guard and the aspects
of his game that were liabilities, conditioning and defense, are no
longer liabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics will be seeking to regain some momentum after two
successive defeats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Detroit was 0-4 when they came here and they were starving,''
Anderson said. ``They had not had a meal in days and they saw that
fat ham sitting there. That was the worst game we have played, but
we still competed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a bad game. We didn't have that same spark. But you
have to stay upbeat, always stay above water. I don't want to
slide, lose three or four games in a row, because every game is so
tough and you never know when your next win is going to come. I
wanted to have a winning record in November, and it will be tough,
but we can still do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Knicks, who visited Minnesota Thursday, should be a
difficult test.
</P>
<P>
   ``Along with Miami and San Antonio, they are the best defensive
teams in the league,'' Pitino said. ``They shoot 46 percent and
make you shoot 38 percent. Fundamentally, they are the soundest
defensive team in the league. If you play their half-court game,
you lose. You have to create a style of play that takes them out of
their game, or else you will not win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics also were vulnerable against the Pistons' inside
quickness. Jerome Williams had 16 rebounds as the Pistons
outrebounded the Celtics, 46-40. The Knicks' Marcus Camby has the
potential to present similar difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Camby is a factor on defense and on the offensive glass,''
Pitino said. ``We will have to do a good job on him. We did not do
a good job of keeping Jerome Williams off the offensive glass.''

CANDIDATE FOR MAYOR REPORTS LITTLE INCOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIN McCORMICK  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ His political opponents may call mayoral
candidate Tom Ammiano a big-spending liberal, but no one can accuse
him of getting rich off public office.
</P>
<P>
   Tax returns and other financial documents covering the last four
years show Ammiano has struggled to stay afloat financially during
his term on the governing Board of Supervisors, a job that paid
$23,924 per year until last year.
</P>
<P>
   At times, he acknowledges, he has had to borrow against the
equity of his home to pay his living expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano, 58, a sometime stand-up comedian, secured second place
in the Nov. 2 election after a three-week write-in campaign. Since
neither Ammiano nor the incumbent, Willie Brown, earned more than
50 percent of the vote for mayor, they must compete in the run-off
election.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano's tax returns show his personal life is almost as low
budget as his campaign has been so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't make that much money,'' said Ammiano, who drives a
1990 Toyota when he's not on the bus and lives in a house he bought
for $29,000 in 1974. ``I'm borrowing on the equity of my home
because the pay for supervisors is so low.''
</P>
<P>
   Combining his city salary with extra money he earned teaching
classes at San Francisco State University and $500 made doing
comedy routines, Ammiano reported a total adjusted income of
$37,629 in 1998. The average city employee, overseen by Ammiano and
the other supervisors, makes $56,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, 65, who earns a salary of $146,255 as mayor plus a state
pension and residual earnings from his old law practice, reported
$329,080 in adjusted income in 1998, his tax returns show.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano, who has been criticized by opponents for proposing a
package of five new city taxes in 1994, hasn't carried much of a
tax burden of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, after writing off $8,000 in home loan interest, he
paid $3,913 in income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Mosher of the Committee on Jobs, which represents San
Francisco's biggest businesses, has harshly criticized Ammiano for
proposing increased taxes on business, stock market trades, real
estate transfers and incomes of over $200,000. Mosher said it is
ironic that Ammiano pays so little himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a very different perspective on taxes if you don't
pay any yourself,'' Mosher said.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano's mortgage records show that he has taken out and repaid
a series of home equity loans. Most recently, in September, he
borrowed $155,000, part of which went to refinance an earlier loan
and part of which, Ammiano said, will go toward maintenance on his
874-square-foot house. None of the money will go to his campaign,
he said.

WASHINGTON GROPES FOR LAWS TO CONTROL THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w, a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It's not a store, but it moves merchandise. It's
not a TV network, but it broadcasts to millions of people. It's not
a magazine, but it publishes plenty of material _ some of it
libelous, and plenty of it pornographic.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has become a massive economic and social force
almost entirely without regulation from Congress or federal
agencies. But increasingly, Washington is being forced to decide if
the laws concerning books, broadcast, and brick-and-mortar stores
are adequate to reckon with the wired world.
</P>
<P>
   In just the past week, the House passed a bill to give
electronic signatures the same validity as the handwritten version.
And the leader of a congressional commission called for banning all
sales taxes on purchases made over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Federal Trade Commission held a public
discussion on limits to ``on-line profiling,'' the practice of
tracking people as they click across the Web in order to advertise
products based on their habits. And last Friday, a federal judge
issued a stinging assessment of Microsoft Corp.'s business
practices that lays the groundwork for broad antitrust penalties.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, the ultimate law or outcome is undecided, with
many people arguing that the old-world concepts of taxation,
antitrust, and other types of regulation have little place in
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our antitrust laws were enacted at a time of slow-moving
trains, not high-speed computers,'' said Senator Pete Domenici,
Republican of New Mexico, after the Microsoft ruling. ``I wonder
whether Congress should reconsider our antiquated antitrust laws
and look for a way to make them more responsive to today's global
high-technology economy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take much candlepower to see that this isn't going
to be an easy thing to do,'' Jerry Berman, executive director of
the Center for Democracy and Technology, said of Internet
regulation. ``The Internet is changing rapidly, and new (computer)
operating systems could be developed tomorrow, and gambling is
moving offshore,'' possibly beyond the reach of US laws. ``The idea
that everything can be worked out using traditional law is proving
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   At least 79 bills were filed in Congress this year to regulate
access to the Internet and the material that travels across it,
according to a tally by Congressional Quarterly, which covers
Capitol Hill. Moreover, a range of federal departments, from health
agencies to stock-market regulators, are grappling with what the
move on line means for their area of the law.
</P>
<P>
   But on some of the largest issues, lawmakers are asking for a
pause before they act. They want time to better understand the new
world of networked computers, and time for industries to try their
hand at self-regulation. Moreover, speedy action resulted in the
Supreme Court rejecting one of their first efforts, a law aimed at
regulating on-line pornography and other material deemed harmful to
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first mantra of the Internet is that before the government
regulates, go slow, that this is a new medium, a young medium, and
it's feeling its way,'' Berman said.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Edward Markey, Democrat of Malden, said that
there are many established legal principles that should be extended
quickly to the Internet. For example, he said, Congress has barred
companies from tracking which cable television shows a person
watches and selling the data to marketers. Phone calling patterns
and video rental records are also private.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only question is whether this new commercial phenomenon
(of on-line shopping) should be held to the same standards as other
commerce,'' Markey said. Privacy and consumer protection laws
should protect people on line as much as in other activities, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The most active issues include:
</P>
<P>
   --Sales taxes. While on-line retail sales could grow to $80
billion next year, up from $9 billion in 1998, Congress last year
imposed a three-year moratorium on Internet taxes and appointed a
study commission.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, which will report in April, must balance the
argument that taxes might choke Internet growth with the budgetary
needs of cities and states, which depend on sales tax revenues.
This week, the panel's chief proposed banning Internet sales taxes
and using federal money to cover the revenue that cities and states
would lose.
</P>
<P>
   --Stock trading. With on-line stock accounts expected to
quadruple in four years, to 20 million, regulators are just
beginning to grapple with how consumer-protection laws should apply
on line, where a rumor in a chat room can move stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, has warned that the established stock markets must use
the rise of on-line trading to give small traders the highest price
when they sell stock and the lowest price when they buy. Currently,
some critics say that individual investors do not get the best
prices because brokerage firms fill orders for large customers
first.
</P>
<P>
   --Privacy. While the number of households on line will jump to
43 percent this year, up from 6 percent in 1994, Congress has yet
to address many aspects of on-line privacy. At the lawmakers'
direction, the Federal Trade Commission last month issued rules to
protect the privacy of children but little has been done about
adult Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, lawmakers failed to meet their own deadline for
passing laws on medical records privacy, an issue made more
pressing because records are often stored electronically and
accessed over computer networks. Independently of Congress, the
Department of Health and Human Services recently issued a set of
privacy protections for electronic health records.
</P>
<P>
   --Gambling. The Justice Department has prosecuted several
on-line gambling operators and won several guilty pleas, using a
nearly 40-year-old law that bans wagers on phone lines or other
wires without state approval. But it is unclear whether these laws
apply to the Internet, and Congress has not yet spoken.
</P>
<P>
   --Antitrust. As soon as the Justice Department filed charges
against Microsoft, alleging that it used its Windows monopoly to
hurt competitors and consumers, critics said that the software
world moves too fast for antitrust regulation to be effective. What
looks like a monopoly today could be gone with a quick technology
shift tomorrow, they said.
</P>
<P>
   That is not the way Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson saw it. In his
200-page preliminary findings of fact last week, which agreed with
many of the government's claims, the federal district judge devoted
about 30 pages to discussing the durability of Microsoft's market
power.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson acknowledged that plenty of new computing products are
on the horizon, such as hand-held computers, ``smart'' cell phones,
and TV set-top boxes, which will make televisions more like
computers. He wrote that people may soon use these devices instead
of Microsoft software to send e-mail and browse the Web. He noted
the rise of Linux, a rival operating system to Microsoft's Windows.
</P>
<P>
   But none of that dampens the fact that Microsoft holds a
monopoly today, the judge wrote, and that its market power will
continue in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Others have disagreed, saying that the computer world moves too
quickly for prosecutors to respond. Their most signficant evidence:
After the trial began last year, one company that the government
says was injured by Microsoft's business practices _ Netscape
Communications Corp. _ was acquired by America Online, giving it
new resources for a fight with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this case ever makes it to the Supreme Court, Microsoft and
the Justice Department will be arguing about events in a
long-forgotten world,'' wrote David S. Evans of National Economic
Research Associates Inc. in Cambridge, Mass. in September.

BRADLEY, GORE STEP UP PURSUIT OF GAY VOTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ During his 18 years in the Senate, Bill Bradley
rarely mentioned gay and lesbian rights, and one of his last acts
before retiring was to oppose gay leaders on a bill that would have
recognized same-sex marriage.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, the Democratic presidential candidate has emerged
as one of the nation's most forthright proponents of equal rights
for gays and lesbians, urging a step even many activists are wary
of _ reopening the 1964 Civil Rights Act to encompass gays.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's new emphasis led one leading gay-oriented magazine,
The Advocate, to marvel that the former New Jersey senator has
moved ``to the left'' of Representative Barney Frank, the openly
gay Newton Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   It has almost moved Vice President Al Gore, concerned about
losing a constituency that could swing the election in some key
states, to play some catch up with Bradley in seeking gay support.
Gore has vowed to loosen the administration's ``Don't Ask-Don't
Tell'' policy on gays in the military and said last week that
``sexual orientation is a main topic for the expansion of freedom
and human dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is this unprecedented pursuit of the gay and lesbian
vote more vividly on display than in California _ and apparently
for good political reason. On March 7, when Californians vote in a
potentially decisive presidential primary, the ballot will include
an initiative to ban marriage between gay partners. That is
expected to spur one of the largest gay votes in US history, which
in turn could affect who wins the primary and the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gay vote has become a central part of the Democratic
coalition. It is an astonishing yardstick of how far the gay and
lesbian issue has come,'' said David Mixner, a leading California
gay activist who is supporting Gore. ``If there is a low Democratic
turnout in March,'' Mixner said, ``the one group that will turn out
en masse will be the gay and lesbian community.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Gore and Bradley have made frequent trips to
California to meet with gay leaders, dueling over the constituency
in a way that was unimaginable to gay activists earlier this
decade. Some Republican presidential candidates, meanwhile, also
are courting gays. On Monday, Senator John McCain, the Arizona
Republican, said he was ``unashamed'' to work with the Log Cabin
Republicans, a group of gay and lesbian Republicans. But the
Republicans generally aren't going nearly as far as Bradley and
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates, gay voters account for 5 percent of the
electorate. But the number may be in the higher single digits in
some of the most important political states, including California
and New York _ both of which Democrats believe they must win next
fall, especially if the Republican presidential candidate captures
Texas and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   While there has been no scientific survey of California gay
voters, there is considerable evidence that Bradley has fast been
making major inroads with gays and lesbians. Last June, Bradley
spent several hours meeting with gay and lesbian activists in
California. The event served as a wake-up call to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last September, in a move that surprised even many of
Bradley's gay backers, the former senator told The Advocate that he
would support reopening the 1964 Civil Rights Act to include gays
and lesbians. Bradley said that Congress ``should add sexual
orientation to the 1964 Civil Rights Act.'' That would clearly
indicate, he said, that discrimination against gays is every bit as
serious as discrimination against other protected groups.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine contrasted Bradley's stance to that of many gay
leaders, including Frank who prefers a stand-alone
antidiscrimination bill instead of reopening the landmark civil
rights legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one fell swoop, he came close to erasing seven years of
hard work by Gore within the gay community,'' said Chris Bull, the
Washington correspondent for The Advocate who recently was granted
interviews with both Bradley and Gore about their stance on gay
issues. ``Bradley hadn't done particularly much. It was smart on
Bradley's part.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser said the former senator had ``no
epiphany'' on gay rights but instead views it as a logical
extension of his support for civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the effect of Bradley's stance on gay voters has been
powerful.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Melamed, a West Hollywood personal agent who has been
active in gay rights for 20 years, said that many gays and lesbians
had presumed they would ``jump on the Gore bandwagon.'' Melamed
contributed $1,000 to the Gore campaign. But as Bradley's views on
gay issues gained publicity _ and after Bradley called Melamed to
seek his support _ Melamed became convinced the former New Jersey
senator was a more fervent believer in equal rights.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Melamed will come full circle: the former Gore
contributor will be a cohost at a Hollywood fund-raiser for
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not an issue Bradley chose to champion,'' Melamed said,
referring to Bradley's days in the Senate. ``But the climate is
very different in this country than six, 12, 18 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Some observers, however, think that Bradley made a strategic
mistake in calling for a reopening of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. A
number of civil rights leaders, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson,
questioned Bradley's proposal, worrying that a
Republican-controlled Congress might weaken the Civil Rights Act if
it was reopened. Frank said in an interview that reopening the
Civil Rights Act would be impracticable.
</P>
<P>
   While gay rights still is controversial, the public view of gay
rights has shifted significantly during this decade. In 1992, a
Gallup poll found that 57 percent of Americans deemed the gay
lifestyle unacceptable, compared with 38 percent who called it
acceptable. The same survey this year found a turnaround in views:
those surveyed believe, by a 50-46 margin, that the gay lifestyle
is acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   That has translated into unprecedented political power for gays
and lesbians. In the 1988 campaign, many presidential candidates,
including Gore, put little emphasis on the issue. In 1992, Clinton
sought the gay vote but ran into criticism when he backed a ``Don't
Ask-Don't Tell'' policy. Some conservatives felt the policy went
too far in allowing gays to serve in the military, while gay
activists complained that it didn't allow gays to openly state
their sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spent the years since trying to improve his relations with
gays and took a major step in that direction earlier this year when
he announced that he favored the legal protections for gay
partners, such as the kind of health benefits that a married spouse
can receive. Bradley also favors such benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the leading Republican candidates also are courting the
gay community, but none of them embrace nearly as much of the gay
rights agenda as the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has made the most determined overture, meeting on Monday
with the Log Cabin Republicans, a group with 11,000 members. But a
McCain aide said later the senator doesn't endorse key legislation
favored by gay activists, such as a bill that would specifically
forbid employers from discriminating against gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Governor George W. Bush, the GOP front-runner, has been
criticized by some gay activists for not embracing a hate-crimes
bill in his state that would specifically include protections for
gays. Steve Forbes said recently that he would hire qualified gays
as long as they aren't trying to make ``a political statement.''
GOP candidate Alan Keyes has had the harshest words for gays,
saying that ``homosexuality is an abomination . . . the comparison
between race and homosexuality is absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   In California, with its large gay community, the ballot question
that would ban same-sex marriage is being closely watched by the
campaigners. Bradley and Gore have said that while they do not
support same-sex marriage, they would vote against the ballot
initiative because it is divisive. That has prompted Rob Glazier, a
Sacramento spokesman for the Campaign to Defend Marriage, which is
pushing for passage of the ballot measure, to charge that Bradley
and Gore are being hypocritical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore and Bradley are saying to the American people that they
support the traditional definition of marriage being between a man
and a woman, yet they both raise a lot of money from the gay
community,'' Glazier said. ``They are trying to convince Americans
they are mainstream. They shouldn't have it both ways.''
</P>
<P>
   But to longtime gay activists such as Frank, the larger message
of the Democratic primary is that the candidates are arguing about
how to expand gay rights, not whether to limit them.
</P>
<P>
   ``My best hopes have been vindicated,'' Frank said, when asked
about the effort by the Democratic candidates to win over gay
voters. ``This is the first time in American history that people
have been treating gays and lesbians as if they were any other
legitimate group.''

BOY GEORGE IS NO TEXAS RANGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Boston newscaster Andy Hiller popped his
match-the-country-to-its-foreign-leader quickie quiz, and George W.
Bush flunked, there was a lot of eye-rolling and gum-flapping about
how fair it was.
</P>
<P>
   Cheap shot, ambush, gotcha-game were some of the terms tossed
about by pundits who take themselves utterly seriously. Like
football officials debating an NFL penalty call while the game
stagnates, we journalistic zebras sometimes succumb to the tendency
to insert ourselves into the game when it should be reserved for
the combatants.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, apparently, was too cagey to take the cheese when
Hiller tried the same gambit on him. In the last election, Lamar
Alexander stepped on his necktie when he was stumped by a
questioner who challenged him to cough up the price of a quart of
milk and a loaf of bread.
</P>
<P>
   I give Hiller credit for a good gimmick. Any campaigning
politician is fair game for any question within bounds of
propriety. Learning to turn aside a potential stumper is basic
training for any tyro politician. The reason Hiller's cheeky
challenge has resonated through the pundit world is that it lifts
the veil on a very basic question about the front-runner _ the man
most likely to be our next president, if you believe the polls. The
question about Bush: Is this guy really a dope, or what?
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor has proven to be a popular and affable
campaigner-in-the-flesh. He does great in front of adoring crowds,
backslapping supporters, Republican office holders, and rich
Republicans lugging checkbooks.
</P>
<P>
   But his campaign has been a Bubble Boy operation from the
get-go. Texas Rangers elbow aside the common ruck of humanity.
Events are tightly scripted. Bush is protected from criticism at
every turn. He ducks debates. His interviews are few and far
between except with ``friendlies.''
</P>
<P>
   The rough-tough Texas bad boy image clashes with
frozen-in-campaign-consultant-amber reality. The wild man of the
frat house is on a short leash. Most of his so-called public events
are fund-raisers, in which his scripted sound bites are delivered
before carefully vetted crowds of dutiful Republicans under
flattering lights against cheerful backdrops.
</P>
<P>
   There's no crime in any of this. It's standard spin-doctor fare,
with the all-important visuals left to the image-crafter.
Portraying the privileged Bush-boy as a rugged West Texas
wildcatter helps take the elitist sheen off the lad who was ushered
through Andover, Yale, and Harvard Business School.
</P>
<P>
   You can do a lot with millions of dollars for a TV makeover, and
Bush has benefited from his PR buildup, just as the young JFK
prospered with his daddy's patrimony and connections. But the Rose
Garden strategy cooked up by the Bush high command in Austin has
pumped up a presidential front-runner woefully short in the
gravitas department.
</P>
<P>
   Is this guy heavy enough to run the country? We don't know. He
looked goofy in the Andy Hiller interview, which was apparently
scheduled as a routine give-a-local-TV-reporter-a-few-minutes
throwaway for a Boston channel whose signal goes into New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   In the rare moments we have seen Bush taking unscripted
questions from nonfriendly media types, he has displayed some
rookie nerves. He tends to repeat his soundbites, to stammer
ungrammatically (note the Ted Kennedy similarity), and to look sort
of peeved if things aren't going his way.
</P>
<P>
   He shows some of his father's impatience with lesser life, like
journalists, which was all the more jarring because it contrasted
with R. Reagan's practiced, if vacuous, jocularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is this, 50 questions?'' ventured the flustered George W.
He didn't get that right, either. He apparently intended to draw a
comparison to the old parlor game, ``Twenty Questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's academic record was no great shakes, it appears, and his
vaunted business acumen has been, to put it generously, benefited
mightily from persons in Texas with reason to curry favor with his
old man.
</P>
<P>
   He has spent a grand total of less than six years in public
office. He has won only two elections. In the first, he defeated
Ann Richards to become governor of Texas in 1994, when any Democrat
running in the South in the Year of Newt was road kill. And last
year Bush beat a woefully underfunded Democrat. In both campaigns,
Bush had only one televised debate against each general election
opponent. He did all his business with TV ads.
</P>
<P>
   Now his secretive campaign staff in Texas pulls the strings with
marvelous manipulative skill. They do a great job of covering up
their guy's weaknesses. Boy George gets weekends off, according to
an admiring New York Times column by old Nixon speechwriter William
Safire, who must know a thing or two about how you win the White
House with string pullers. The Bush camp rations George W.'s
exposure to TV audiences, and the front-runner will spend half his
days at home through Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush canceled out of the only televised New Hampshire
candidate's night so far, the excuse was that he had to be in
Dallas to watch his wife get an award. That proved to be a mistake.
John McCain's surge in New Hampshire showed the J.R. Ewing approach
to politics doesn't go down well up here. You have to win on the
road to take the White House, and George W., off the evidence to
date, is not much of a road warrior.

RUSSIAN MILITARY FALLS IN BEHIND PUTIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV AND BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOZDOK, Russia _ In a large tent on Russia's main air base in
the Caucasus about three weeks ago, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin
raised his glass of vodka to the senior commanders of Moscow's
offensive in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   He proposed a toast to the success of the Russian campaign
against separatist Chechen militants, and to lasting peace in the
strife-torn Caucasus region. But just as the 15 assembled generals
and colonels were about to drink, the premier slammed down his
glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys, I'll drink when this is over and there are no more
bandits in this land,'' Putin declared, according to several who
were present. The officers put their glasses down, too.
</P>
<P>
   That was when the generals knew that Putin was their man.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's six-week-old offensive in Chechnya belongs to Putin as
much as it belongs to the generals. The former KGB spy has linked
his political aspirations and future to the success of that
campaign, and has vowed to defeat the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Now the military is returning the favor.
</P>
<P>
   As civilian casualties mount in Chechnya and the West pressures
the Kremlin to begin talks to end the war, speculation has grown in
Moscow that Putin, the war's architect, will soon be fired by
President Boris Yeltsin _ who has sacked four prime ministers since
March 1998 when they threatened to eclipse him.
</P>
<P>
   That is something that leading military commanders, who last
week threatened to quit if the Kremlin stops their offensive, are
determined to prevent.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by their failure in Russia's 1994-96 war in Chechnya,
a conflict they say politicians prevented them from winning, the
generals now say they can defeat the separatists if Moscow does not
interfere.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Putin's tough stance in the army tent in Mozdok, the
generals believed he meant what he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hearing that from Putin, we knew he was with us,'' said one
officer who was there. ``It was a real vote of confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   General Vladimir Shamanov, who commands Russia's forces in the
Caucasus, said: ``I would say that Vladimir Vladimirovich (Putin)
is today a symbol behind which many people march. I am in the first
rank, without a doubt. All Russians are sick of the fact that
Russia is humiliated, insulted, and asking for handouts.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Shamanov told Russian State Television that he will
resign if ordered to halt his troops' advance in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would tear off my stripes and go and do something in
civilian life. I would no longer serve in such an army,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Anatoly Kvashnin, the Armed Forces general staff chief, has also
threatened to resign, along with several other officers, if a
cease-fire is ordered in the breakaway region.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Zhilin, a retired army colonel and Moscow-based
military analyst, said the generals were really sending a
not-so-subtle message to the Kremlin: don't mess with our Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past week, Russia's leading newspapers and television
stations have been reporting that Yeltsin is about to sack his
prime minister, whose popularity has soared as the war has
progressed.
</P>
<P>
   The generals' threats were interpreted by many here as a
challenge to Russia's civilian government. But in a country where
the past three prime ministers _ Putin, Sergei Stepashin and
Yevgeny Primakov _ all came out of Russia's highly militarized
security services, it is difficult to speak of a civilian
government in the Western sense.
</P>
<P>
   The real message the generals were trying to send, analysts
said, is that they are happy with the current government and prime
minister, and they do not want it changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The generals were sending the Kremlin a warning not only not
to interfere in military affairs but also not to interfere with
Putin's government,'' Zhilin said. ``Putin and the generals have
found a common language.''
</P>
<P>
   And it appears that, for now at least, the Kremlin has gotten
the message. Yeltsin has reportedly assured military leaders that
the war will not be stopped. He also awarded Hero of Russia medals
to Kvashnin and other leading generals.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Kremlin spokesman Igor Shabdurasulov said this week in
a radio interview that there ``can be no talk'' about ousting
Putin, who was a political unknown when Yeltsin named him prime
minister in August. At the time, Yeltsin also said he wanted his
new premier to succeed him as president.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the dour and steely Putin has become the leading
candidate in the presidential elections scheduled for next year.
Polls show that more than 60 percent of Russia's electorate approve
of his performance as prime minister and about 30 percent would
vote for him in the elections.
</P>
<P>
   But just as importantly, Putin appears also to have gone from
being Yeltsin's boy to being his own man, with his own political
base in Russia's powerful military and security services.
</P>
<P>
   ``A large part of the military establishment sees Putin as a
guarantee that the war in Chechnya will continue, that the military
budget will increase and that Russia will take a more assertive
stand abroad,'' Alexander Pikayev, a military analyst at the Moscow
Carnegie Center, said. ``For a long time the military has been
dissatisfied with what it sees as Yeltsin's weak foreign policy.
Putin's style and behavior contrasts with this sharply.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin has already increased military spending by $387 million
for this year and his 2000 budget calls for another increase of $1
billion. Next year, Russia's proposed military budget will be $5.57
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin is limited in his political base and doesn't have the
complete support of the Yeltsin administration. He has turned to
the military and security services for support,'' Pikayev said.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin may be itching once again to fire his popular prime
minister. But with the military solidly behind Putin, the mercurial
Yeltsin could be stuck with him.

WINDMILLS BEING STOLEN IN NORTH TEXAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GALE M. BRADFORD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEATHERFORD, Texas _ A windmill thief is on the loose in Parker
County, and Sheriff Jay Brown and others believe that the heists
might be Y2K-related.
</P>
<P>
   A windmill _ with 8-foot metal blades and a 24-foot tower _ was
stolen last week from a ranch near Millsap. The previous week, a
windmill head was stolen.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this Y2K thing coming on, everybody wants a windmill,''
Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of a Fort Worth windmill company agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bumper year for windmills. I call it the Y2K crazies,''
said Mark Welch, owner of the Second Wind Windmill Service Co.,
which sells 200 to 300 windmills yearly to working ranches, and 10
or so more as ``yard toys.''
</P>
<P>
   Welch said that along with stocking up on food, ammunition,
batteries and hand pumps, some people are scrambling for windmills.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're fearful that electricity will fail and they won't have
a way to get water,'' Welch said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've sold two hand pumps in 20 years and had one in my
inventory for years, then finally discounted it to almost nothing
to get rid of it. Two years ago, they cost about $210. Today they
cost about $650, and you have to get on a 16-week waiting list just
to order one.''
</P>
<P>
   George Conley of Springtown said about half the windmills he
installs are just for looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put in several a year that are not for pumping water.
They're just put up to look good and to look at,'' Conley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think it would take somebody extra brave and bold to
steal a windmill, but it wouldn't be impossible,'' he said. ``It
could be a popular thing to do today because some people put one up
just for looks. In other words, they aren't connected to a water
well. They're just put up to look good and to look at.''
</P>
<P>
   Buster Nations of Millsap, who reported a windmill stolen from
his ranch last week, said, ``The fact that windmills have become a
popular yard ornament could have generated a market for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's more people wanting to put them up for appearance
sake. They don't have any need to use them.''
</P>
<P>
   Nations' 60- to 80 year-old windmill, valued at $3,400, was on
the ground. He said it could have been carried out through a
six-strand barbed-wire fence that was cut, but because the 8-foot
metal blades and 24-foot metal tower weigh about 800 pounds, it
would have been more practical to use a trailer or truck to remove
them.
</P>
<P>
   Mack Dugan of Weatherford reported that he had a windmill head
stolen two weeks ago. He said thieves cut the lock off his gate and
removed an 8-foot unit that weighed about 300 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   He said truck tracks and identifying marks on the blades might
help apprehend the crooks. He valued the blades at about $1,200.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time was when only poor people used windmills. They were the
ones without utilities,'' Dugan said. ``Today, it's the rich folks
that want them, and I think thieves resell them and probably make a
right smart.''

RUDOLPH THE HARD-NOSED REINDEER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Well in advance of the holiday season, our shopping force is
already scouring the stores, looking for items of interest such as
this:
</P>
<P>
   A devoted reader went to Pottery Barn the other day to buy
Christmas place settings for his family. Jumping the gun, you might
think, but no; the place settings in question, emblazoned with a
not unattractive reindeer motif, sold out before Thanksgiving last
year. He had previously bought a few plates, and was returning for
the plat de resistance: the centerpiece platter featuring Rudolph
the Red-Nosed Reindeer.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, no Rudolph. As it was explained by staffers on the scene,
Pottery Barn had made a mistake relatively common in modern
America. They assumed (dangerous to assume!) that Rudolph _ like
his companions Donner, Blitzen, &AMP; Co. _ is a public-domain
character. But he is not. So this year's companion platter features
Vixen and Dasher.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph is the creation of the late Robert May, who wrote the
original children's poem as a Christmas promotion for his employer,
Montgomery Ward. By the end of World War II, Monkey Ward had
distributed more than 3 million free copies of the poem, making
Rudolph _ who was almost named Reginald, or Rollo _ a national
celebrity. In 1947, Ward gave the rights to Rudolph back to May.
Two years later, May's brother-in-law, Johnny Marks, wrote the
famous song that Gene Autry, Alvin and the Chipmunks, and dozens of
other recording artists have engraved in our memories, for better
or worse.
</P>
<P>
   So who owns Rudolph? May's daughter, Virgina Herz, who lives in
California, and she's locked up the copyright through 2014.
(Dartmouth College also has a significant Rudolph archive,
including cookie jars, neckties, and the original Monkey Ward
manuscript, donated by loyal alumnus May.) Herz wasn't available
for comment, and a spokeswoman for San Francisco-based Pottery Barn
professed ignorance of the whole affair.
</P>
<P>

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Arguably (equals) Not
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Arguably Watch continues with this contribution from Tom
Scocca, late of The Boston Phoenix and now writing for Baltimore's
City Paper: ``The Knicks have arguably two of the top 10 players in
the NBA in Allan Houston and Latrell Sprewell,'' quoth the
CNN-Sports Illustrated Web site. Says Scocca: ``Off the top of my
head, I count 28 players who are _ inarguably _ better than Houston
or Sprewell.''
</P>
<P>
   I encountered the a-word in Rupert Murdoch's utterly mediocre
London Times: ``The brilliant Michael Winner, arguably the most
significant film director of the postwar era,'' blah blah blah.
Winner is a technically proficient journeyman director who has
directed many movies, including ``Death Wish'' and its two sequels,
``DWI'' and ``DWII.'' He also happens to be a columnist for another
Murdoch-owned newspaper, the Sunday Times.

</P>
<P>
   'Twasn't

<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An alert reader noticed the following squib in the Portland
Press Herald's feature ``Biblio Files,'' in which prominent Maine
citizens natter on about their favorite books and authors: Robert
Gardiner, president of Maine Public Broadcasting, praised Tom
Wolfe, Aldo Leopold, and Mark Twain, dissed Tom Clancy, and then
was asked, ``Who is your favorite author, and why?'' Gardiner
replied, ``Evelyn Waugh, because her books are so witty and
unpredictable. I have read many of her books and have loved every
one. I can't say that about many other authors.''
</P>
<P>
   Ain't she great! The newspaper says the gender mishap came in an
e-mail from MPR, where some underling is blamed for gelding Mr.
Waugh. In a subsequent correction, the newspaper fell on its sword
and admitted that ``Waugh was a man'' . . . Perhaps my editors
could hire some underlings for me to blame for my occasional slips,
like calling Ireland the land of author Frank McCourt's birth in a
recent column. In fact, McCourt was born in the United States.

THE BAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ART ADV.: A photo is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers

 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The scene at the Atlantic Fish Company on a recent
afternoon is like a chapter from a parenting manual. Call it
Oysters and Diapers: Adventures in Dining With Your Newborn. Kay
Hanley and Michael Eisenstein _ leaders of the Boston rock band
Letters To Cleo, and parents of 4-month-old Zoe _ have just
discovered a nappy-related problem. Hanley (she of scathing
punk-pop vocals) is berating herself for not bringing a change of
clothes for the baby. Eisenstein (renowned for raucous power
chords) suggests a quick run to Baby Gap. But the model modern dad
instead spirits Zoe off to the men's room, returning 20 minutes
later with a clean, if scantily-clad, baby.
</P>
<P>
   Life has changed for this pair who once pursued rock 'n' roll
excesses with the gleeful enthusiasm they now reserve for cooing
over their child. Letters To Cleo _ a band that was the break-out
darling of the Boston rock scene in the mid-'90s _ hasn't performed
together in more than a year. The quintet has been without a record
contract since mid-1998, and hasn't had a hit single since 1994,
when the song ``Here and Now,'' from the band's debut CD, ``Aurora
Gory Alice,'' was featured on TV's ``Melrose Place.'' (Two
subsequent albums, 1995's ``Wholesale Meats and Fish'' and 1997's
``Go!'' were commercial disappointments.)
</P>
<P>
   In an unforgiving industry that's only grown more ruthless in
the aftermath of record label mega-mergers and artist-roster
slashings, and faced with a music culture where trends come and go
as fast as a three-minute pop song, Letters To Cleo is wading back
in _ fortified with healthy doses of both circumspection and
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, there is this feeling of . . . are we really relevant? In
the big, horrible, ugly world of radio, are we even going to
matter? Do we want to go out and pursue a deal again? And how much
more of my life do I want to invest in this, really?'' Hanley is
her usual candid and forthright self, though she swears, after
three mangled attempts at articulating the word relevant, that
infantitis has claimed her verbal skills. ``On the other hand,''
she says, ``I've been in this band since I was 18. You know, my
entire identity is informed by this experience. And the band brings
me a lot of happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisenstein concurs. Like his wife, he takes a philosophical
approach to riding the industry roller-coaster. ``We had to get
off, because they were going nowhere with or without us,'' says
Eisenstein of the band's departure last year from Revolution
Records, a subsidiary of Warner Bros. ``They were yanking our chain
every time,'' adds Hanley, a stickler for accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of chaos,'' Eisenstein concedes. ``They
couldn't pick a single. They hemmed and hawed on a video budget.
They didn't know what they wanted and they didn't know what they
wanted us to be. But it wasn't like we were coming off a platinum
record and now we were free agents. The security blanket was pulled
out. We were happy and sad and worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Letters To Cleo found themselves more in demand as
an unsigned band _ which makes the notion of this being a comeback
seem a bit exaggerated. They may have been label-less, but the band
continued to work. Soundtrack offers started pouring in almost
immediately, resulting in LTC songs in the recent films
``Jawbreaker'' and ``Ten Things I Hate About You.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It turns out there were people who wanted to work with us for
a long time but who didn't want to deal with our old label,'' says
Eisenstein. ``Didn't want to deal with Irving,'' Hanley clarifies,
referring to Irving Azoff, the veteran industry bigwig who ran
their label.
</P>
<P>
   Most serendipitous of all was a query from Sony Wonder, which
was looking for a female-fronted band to supply songs for ``Molly
O,'' an animated children's series being developed about an
8-year-old rock star. Hanley faxed them some ideas, but didn't hear
back for many months. ``Then in June they called, they're like
`alright, we need a song by Thursday,' '' Hanley recalls. ``It was
a Saturday. I'm 8 1/2 months pregnant. We wrote it on Sunday and
Monday, went into the studio and recorded it on Tuesday. I couldn't
breathe. You know, I really thought my uterus might explode. We
mixed it on Wednesday, put it in the mail that night, and got it to
them on Thursday. It was a burst of activity that I did not know we
had in us.''
</P>
<P>
   That burst of activity jump-started more than just a foray into
television, although ``Molly O'' _ which will premiere next fall on
one of several networks currently bidding for it _ comes at an
auspicious time. It will supply both the luxury of working at home
and a steady paycheck while Letters To Cleo puts the wheels in
motion once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was time,'' Hanley announces emphatically, ``to write our
own music. For my own satisfaction, my own sense of well-being . .
. I really need to be doing this.'' Hanley dreamed up the idea of a
four-week October residency at the Kendall Cafe in Cambridge, just
she and Michael, voice and guitar, working up new material and
dusting off the old. ``I needed to have a deadline, especially
right now with the baby. It forced us to get the songs down.''
</P>
<P>
   And it lit a fire in Hanley that she frankly didn't anticipate.
``A month and a half ago, I was nowheresville in my feelings toward
the band. I would have been happy hanging out with Zoe and writing
songs for the cartoon. But there was the residency, and then all of
sudden there's the new batch of songs, and we're rehearsing, and
we've got a big rock show!'' she laughs. ``The thing is, once
things start rolling with us, generally they go at warp speed.''
</P>
<P>
   The band has booked time at Q Division studios next month, where
Letters To Cleo will record demo tapes to shop for a new deal.
Hanley is confident, she says, in the band's ability to take the
world by storm. All they need to do is make the album that turns
people's attention away from ``Here and Now,'' which was featured a
few weeks ago on MTV's ``Ultrasound'' special about one-hit wonders
of the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absurd,'' says Hanley. ``I could be bitter about it, but
I see it for what it is. My band is identified with that song, and
I'm identified as the girl who sings the fast part. You could see
it as a terrible albatross around our necks. But it was also a
tremendous blessing. That song gave us a certain amount of
insurance that we would be able to make albums in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, everything that's happened to us has kind of
happened by fate,'' admits Hanley, who always thought she'd wind up
a novelist. ``That we were never real precious about doing it in
the first place has saved us from a lot of heartache and a lot of
bruised egos. We've just never been as bummed out as people told us
we should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisenstein, however, makes no bones about the fact that he would
very much like to sell millions and millions of records. He doesn't
wonder for a second if they can write great songs. He fully
believes it's not even possible for Letters To Cleo to make an
album that doesn't have a couple of potential hit singles. All they
need is a chance to step up to the plate. ``Inside 128, we're
huge!'' Eisenstein proclaims. ``It's not that far-fetched.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, everything's changed. Hanley's usual method of writing a
song, playing it through once, taking it to the band and letting
the guys go to town on it has been upended. At the Kendall, Hanley
says, ``we played these new songs so quiet, so stripped-down. I'm
getting so used to hearing them this way that I'm starting to
think, well, maybe it's time to do something mature, you know, our
`Car Wheels on a Gravel Road,' '' she says, referring to Lucinda
Williams's bare-bones gem from last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sort of feeling like an Earth mother, in the core of my
soul.'' Hanley gazes at Zoe, sleeping peacefully in her stroller
next to the table. Then she glances sideways, and rolls her eyes.
``But then I think, `uugh, I don't know.' There's something that
happens when we're all together. I'm not stuck on any one thing.''
</P>
<P>
   So everything's changed, and everything is, in a way, still the
same. The band is intact, invigorated, pumped to play, ready to
record. Hanley and Eisenstein are writing. Ideas are flowing like
wine. Letters To Cleo is ready to jump back into the game. But
there's this little girl _ she's awake now, kicking her tiny legs
and smiling up at her parents _ who makes it all feel very, very
different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making an album, it used to be like putting everything you
have into that creation. You'd put it out there, and it was like
fresh meat to the wolves. I've never gotten used to it, being torn
to shreds for what I do. On some level, having her, it's put
everything in perspective. It's like, I've done this in my life,''
says Hanley, turning toward Zoe. ``I think from now on it's going
to be much easier.''

A STUNNINGLY STABLE `AFTERSHOCK' 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
AFTERSHOCK: EARTHQUAKE IN NEW YORK 
Starring: Sharon Lawrence, Cicely Tyson, Jennifer Garner, Frederick
Weller, Lisa Nicole Carson, Charles Dutton, Tom Skerritt 
Directed by: Mikael Salomon 
On: CBS 
Time: Sunday and Tuesday nights at 9 
Rated: TVPG 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With its intense 15 minutes of brownstone-facade-crumbling, Lady
Liberty-cracking, flailing-body-flying, fire-and-smoke-spewing,
car-alarm-wailing, dust-and-cement-raining horror, ``Aftershock:
Earthquake in New York'' powerfully imagines what a 7.0 shake would
look like in the Big Apple. The two-part TV movie, a CBS sweeps
event airing Sunday and Tuesday nights at 9), offers up a
stunningly vivid fantasy of the undoing of Manhattan in the middle
of an ordinary urban afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But the earthquake, which occurs midway through Part 1, is the
only convincing thing in this overlong, paint-by-numbers disaster
movie. How strange it is to watch such a catastrophe and think,
yawn, ``Been there, done that.'' Every single one of the characters
is a familiar TV type, and the plot lines include nary a surprise.
It's a prime example of how lazy TV and movie scripts can turn
viewers into fortunetellers, as we learn to read the fates of
characters after only a few scenes. Right off the bat, you'll know
(or at least I knew; read no further if you don't want the obvious
spelled out) that the daddy's-girl ballerina will find love with
her immigrant cabbie, that the guilty mother will rescue her
disabled son, that the feuding mayor and fire chief will learn to
forget their differences.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the lead players are from other TV shows. Sharon
Lawrence, currently on ``Ladies Man,'' plays the overprotective
mother. She has the movie's most ridiculous subplot, which
ultimately finds her being hoisted into a collapsed school to
collect her son, all dolled up like a renegade with a handkerchief
around her forehead, dirt smudged on her cheeks, and lots of
emergency spandex. Jennifer Garner, one of the Manhattanites on
``Time of Your Life,'' is the spoiled dancer, and Lisa Nicole
Carson from ``Ally McBeal'' plays a lawyer who gets a murder
suspect off the hook, then gets trapped in the subway system with
him. We're supposed to wonder if he really committed the murder,
but one look at his cool eyes and you'll know. Charles Dutton and
Tom Skerritt are on hand as public officials, a pair of actors who
are better than their roles here. Also deserving of richer material
is Cicely Tyson, who has a small part as a wise grandmother who _
gag _ helps a thug find honor during the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   One of the oddities about these disaster movies is their
penchant for turning the worst events in human history into grand
opportunities _ for romance, for heroism, for peace. Love among the
ruins, as it were. ``Aftershock'' takes this courage business much
too far, wallowing in its own earnestness as the city joins hands
and hearts to save itself. Oh sure, there are three looters
who make their way through the mess, walking into shattered
storefronts, but you just know these bad sports are going to see
the light before the tragedy ends.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
ANYWHERE BUT HERE 
Directed by: Wayne Wang 
Screenplay by: Alvin Sargent (novel: Mona Simpson) 
Starring: Susan Sarandon, Natalie Portman, Eileen Ryan, Ray Baker,
John Diehl, Shawn Hatosy, Bonnie Bedelia, Caroline Aaron, Hart
Bochner 
Running time: 114 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (sex-related material) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Breathing new life into old formulas, ``Anywhere But Here'' aims
its big, bold mother-daughter conflicts straight at the heart by
way of the tear ducts, and connects. There always was a certain
big-screen quality to Mona Simpson's 1986 novel, and Susan Sarandon
and Natalie Portman convince us they're just the ones to bring it
off. They plunge confidently into the story of a discontented
single mom who uproots her resentful teenage daughter from their
life in Wisconsin and drives to Beverly Hills in a used Mercedes
she can't afford. Sarandon's Adele clearly has a spirit too big to
be contained by the confines of a town she sees as a backwater, but
one that her daughter, Ann, regards as a safe cocoon.
</P>
<P>
   Still, pretty soon after they arrive, it's obvious that a role
reversal has taken place, with Portman's serious and intense young
Ann mostly slipping into the adult role her mom isn't quite
prepared to assume. When her romantic mom thinks she's found true
love, it's the astute Ann who sees a one-night stand for what it
is. One of the film's high-impact scenes comes when Ann auditions
for an acting job, not realizing her mother is watching, and
uncorks an improv, a mercilessly accurate and unflattering
impersonation of her mother. Adele, seeing herself thus reflected
in her daughter's eyes, interiorizes her pain, but interiorizes it
intensely.
</P>
<P>
   Ann has more than a few shots at teary emotions too, one coming
when she accuses her mom of keeping her from contacting her
estranged father. She defiantly phones him in Las Vegas, and is
hurt to find that he greets her not with outpourings of the love
she had envisoned, but with a pinched suspicion that she's calling
to get money from him. The back-and-forth is intense, including the
intermittent interactions with family, especially in Portman's
scenes with a beloved cousin (Shawn Hatosy). One reason the film
works as well as it does is that the fast-rising Portman is a
dramatic match for Sarandon's big screen presence. Because
Portman's Ann is strong, and realizes it, she's open, too, to
admiring some things about her mother. Goose that she sometimes is,
Adele shows Ann how to live life without pettiness or meanness, and
even with a sense of flair and style.
</P>
<P>
   Mother and daughter have their troubles, but they enlarge and
deepen each other, and face life courageously. It's easy to like
these women, easy to tie into their ups and downs for the better
part of two hours, despite the transparency of the film's
manipulations. Wayne Wang, who has been this route in ``The Joy
Luck Club,'' knows how to direct light-handedly enough to keep them
palatable. ``Anywhere But Here'' is much closer to ``Stella
Dallas'' than to ``Mildred Pierce.'' Portman's Ann matures
satisfyingly and Sarandon's Adele easily makes the jump from
airhead to earth mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anywhere But Here,'' while more conventional than Sarandon's
last excursion into movie motherhood (``Stepmom''), is also more
likable and better able to connect us to its emotions. Portman and
Sarandon give us more than bravura bonding. Their star turns in the
classic Hollywood mold are permeated by crowd-pleasing warmth and
emotional generosity. Nobody is going to call ``Anywhere But Here''
modernist, but it's simpatico enough to make the
less-than-cutting-edge nature of its delivery system unimportant.
It probably works better for being slightly old-fashioned. With
``Tumbleweeds'' due to arrive from the festival circuit, and now
``Anywhere But Here,'' we're richly supplied with women who buck
the odds, are willing to be called irresponsible, and write
themselves into that most American of activities _ hitting the road
to a better life.

`GUEST' RECOUNTS MEETING OF TWO REMARKABLE MINDS

THE GUEST FROM THE FUTURE 
Anna Akhmatova and Isaiah Berlin 
By Gyorgy Dalos. With the collaboration of Andrea Dunai;
translated, from the German, by Antony Wood. Farrar, Straus &AMP;
Giroux. 250 pp. Illustrated. $25. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In September 1945, Isaiah Berlin arrived at the British Embassy
in Moscow. Five years earlier, he had left Oxford, already on his
way to becoming a figure of academic legend, to join the war
effort. Most of his service had been at the Washington embassy.
Indicating the quality of his work there is the fact both Churchill
and King George regularly read his dispatches.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a diplomatic posting to the Soviet Union made even more
sense. Born in Riga, in what is now Latvia, in 1909, Berlin had
moved with his parents to England when he was 12. He retained a
profound affinity for Russian culture and spoke the language with
no accent.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as soon as he arrived, Berlin started planning a trip to
Leningrad (now St. Petersburg). He had lived there for three years
as a boy and, still the good Oxford don, he had heard that books
were more readily available in the former imperial capital than in
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Leningrad boasted another attraction, though Berlin did not as
yet realize it. Anna Akhmatova lived there.
</P>
<P>
   One of the supreme figures of 20th-century Russian poetry,
Akhmatova ``brought to the Russian lyric the wealth of the
nineteenth-century Russian novel,'' or so thought her literary
contemporary Osip Mandelstam. Like Mandelstam, Akhmatova ran afoul
of Stalinism (unlike him, she survived). Both her son and husband
were imprisoned during the purges, and her poetic cycle ``Requiem''
is a monument to the barely conceivable suffering endured by the
Soviet people.
</P>
<P>
   Literally millions of people had disappeared into the maelstrom
of Stalinism, the great as well as the unknown. So far as the
outside world knew, Akhmatova was one of them _ as likely to be
dead or in a labor camp as living in obscurity. Thus Berlin was
amazed to discover the latter was the case when her name came up
during a casual conversation in a Leningrad bookshop. He was even
more amazed to learn she lived only a few blocks away. ``It was as
if I had suddenly been invited to meet Miss Christina Rossetti,''
he later wrote. ``I could hardly speak: I mumbled that I should
indeed like to meet her.''
</P>
<P>
   What ensued was one of the century's more extraordinary literary
encounters: a meeting of East and West, imagination and intellect,
past and future. Indeed, ``The guest from the future'' is what
Akhmatova called Berlin in her epic sequence, ``Poem Without a
Hero.'' It's also the title the Hungarian novelist and essayist
Gyorgy Dalos has given his ruminative account of the meeting
between them, how it came to be, and what followed from it.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin and Akhmatova spent all of 12 hours together, but that
brief time more than sufficed. Their encounter produced the sort of
spiritual communion commonly found in the pages of Russian
literature but rarely anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Even 35 years later, when Berlin came to write an account of
their conversation (part of his celebrated essay ``Meetings with
Russian Writers in 1945 and 1956''), the emotional intensity of the
encounter remained palpable.
</P>
<P>
   As for Akhmatova, she came to see the meeting has having had
nothing less than global significance. Twenty years later, when
Oxford gave her an honorary degree, she told Berlin that their
meeting had so angered Stalin it helped usher in the Cold War. Such
exaggeration is understandable, perhaps, in light of the dire
personal consequences Akhmatova suffered for having met with a
foreign diplomat. Expelled from the Writers' Union, she was
denounced by a leading Communist Party official as ``half nun, half
whore,'' and her poetry became unpublishable. Also, both her son
and ex-husband were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Dalos adds much detail and a larger context to Berlin's essay,
but his book cannot be said to supplant it. The greatest value of
``The Guest from the Future'' lies in the view it affords of Soviet
culture. Precisely because it was at once so monstrous and absurd,
that world hardly seems credible now to an American. Precisely
because of that monstrousness and absurdity, the fact of its
existence must never be forgotten. ``You come from a society of
human beings,'' Akhmatova remarked to Berlin, ``whereas here we are
divided into human beings and _'' She did not finish the thought.
There was no need for her to do so then. Thanks to Dalos, there is
no need for her to do so now.

THE MESSENGER: THE STORY OF JOAN OF ARC 
Directed by: Luc Besson 
Screenplay by: Andrew Birkin, Besson 
Starring: Milla Jovovich, John Malkovich, Faye Dunaway, Dustin
Hoffman, Pascal Greggory, Vincent Cassel, Tcheky Karyo, Richard
Ridings, Desmond Harrington, Timothy West 
Running time: 141 minutes 
Rated: R (strong graphic battles, a rape and language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No small part of the history of movies consists of men giving
the movie-star treatment to women they're close to. Sometimes it
works brilliantly. Think of Stiller and Garbo. Think of von
Sternberg and Dietrich. Sometimes it doesn't work at all. When
French director Luc Besson cast Milla Jovovich in the title role of
``The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc,'' it may have done
wonders for their relationship, but it doesn't do much for the
film. Jovovich, a former model, can slink with the best of them.
She looks great in armor. She even can ride a horse. But she can't
act.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad, because Besson goes at this retelling with epic size,
epic sweep, and epic amounts of bloody battlefield carnage under
leaden gray skies that press panoramically down upon the world as
if to remind even those looking heavenward of the crushing weight
of medieval life. It begins with a brutal scene of Joan as a girl
in hiding, watching British invaders rape and murder her mother.
But the film begins to smack of compromise when Joan bypasses the
usual hacking off of her long tresses with a dagger and instead has
her hair cut stylishly by a barber at the dauphin's court, a barber
who, incidentally, has mastered the medieval hairdresser's art of
blond highlighting.
</P>
<P>
   Her first meeting with John Malkovich's dauphin, a sly weakling
she means to crown king of a divided, demoralized France, is right
out of ``The Exorcist.'' It's a pattern to which we get accustomed,
as Besson does a lot of cross-cutting to Joan's legendary visions
with MTV moves and computerized effects. The film takes the
contemporary view of Joan as a pioneer feminist who was burned at
the stake for political reasons after being sold out by the king
she championed. It wasn't until this century, 500 years after the
burning, that the church admitted it was perhaps too hasty in
torching her, and whitewashed itself by posthumously declaring her
a saint.
</P>
<P>
   But Joan's trial, presented with such brilliant irony by Shaw in
``Saint Joan,'' is thrown away. Besson does a lot of quick cutting,
almost turning the film into the cinematic equivalent of a shell
game to cover, one supposes, the fact that Jovovich can't speak
lines with any sustained passion, or any inner anything. Because
physicality comes so naturally to her, she's at her best in the
battle scenes where her modus operandi is to shout, ``Follow me.''
She shames the French soldiers into charging with her into battle
and infuriates the English. Grimacing mightily, they just hate it
when they're routed by a 19-year-old peasant girl. They attribute
it to witchcraft, reasoning that no woman on her own could defeat
them.
</P>
<P>
   So there you have it _ a lot of striking pictures in this
would-be feminist ``Braveheart,'' but a film that's pretty flat and
earthbound because of the limitations of the figure at its center.
Besson has surrounded Jovovich with hands experienced at fighting
genre cliche, ranging from John Malkovich's wimpy survivalist
dauphin to Faye Dunaway's manipulative power behind the throne to
Dustin Hoffman, almost unrecognizable as a mysterious hooded figure
who appears to Joan in her dungeon at the end and may be a figment
of her imagination. There's more than a hint that Joan is
hallucinating. What's never there is any hint that there's any
spiritual component in what we're seeing.
</P>
<P>
   The film aims at being a rationalist Joan of Arc, which I think
misses the point. But then Joan lived in an age of religious belief
and we live in an age of scientific data. And in any case, Joan has
always been a challenge for actresses, has always been a tough role
to nail. The best they can hope to do is convince us they're aflame
from within, an achievement totally out of this film's reach, which
in its big, hectic, and thoroughly mundane way can do better than a
Joan aflame from without. Ingrid Bergman wasn't a bad Joan. Poor
Jean Seberg wasn't as bad a Joan as critics said she was. But the
best Joan remains one of the first, Maria Falconetti in Carl
Dreyer's potently expressionistic silent ``The Passion of Joan of
Arc'' (1928). It remains the standard. ``The Messenger: The Story
of Joan of Arc'' isn't even in the running.

`NEW YORK': A LONG, LOVING LOOK AT THE BIG APPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
NEW YORK: A DOCUMENTARY FILM 
Directed by Ric Burns. 
Produced by: Ric Burns and Lisa Ades. 
Written by: Ric Burns and James Sanders. 
When: Sunday through Thursday, 9-11 p.m. 
On: PBS 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ric Burns's PBS documentary on the history of New
York is a city-lover's dream _ a pastiche of photos, film clips,
music, lit-readings, and talking-head musings that unveils the
grandeur and terror of metropolitan life with the sweep of an epic
poem.
</P>
<P>
   Yankee-haters may tire of the narrator's endless exaltation of
Manhattan as center of the universe. (One is often reminded of
Updike's description of the ``true New Yorker,'' who holds the
``secret belief that people living elsewhere had to be, in some
sense, kidding.'')
</P>
<P>
   But Burns's five-part, 10-hour sprawl _ plainly titled ``New
York: A Documentary Film'' _ is as much about the making of modern
America as about any one city.
</P>
<P>
   After all, as one historian puts it, New York was the first city
to test ``all the great experiments of American society'' _
immigration, unionization, industrialization, social-welfare
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Dutch arrived in 1624, it has been the place
where people from every part of the world have gathered, mingled,
and struggled for a piece of the action, a spot in the sun, or
simply a buck to get by.
</P>
<P>
   These are the threads that run through what could have been an
unwieldy narrative: New York as the densely packed melting pot,
where the strengths and foibles of democracy are played out as a
daily street drama; and, as backdrop to this drama, New York as the
cauldron of capitalism, where human dreams and desires are most
wildly satisfied or brutally crushed.
</P>
<P>
   The remarkable thing is that Burns _ who also produced
documentaries on Coney Island, the Donner Party, and (with his
brother, Ken) the Civil War _ takes in this panorama whole. His
view of New York is romantic, unabashedly so, but not sentimental.
</P>
<P>
   Much is made, for instance, of Walt Whitman's celebrations of
the city's lush mosaic (``What hurrying human tides, of day or
night! What passions, winning, losses, ardors, swim thy waters!''
the poet swooned, in ``Leaves of Grass'').
</P>
<P>
   But no less is made of the Draft Riots of 1863, in which the
passions of these human tides _ in this case, 15,000 Irish
immigrants enraged at rich natives and poor blacks _ erupted in a
weeklong melee that resulted in 119 deaths and might have brought
down the city but for intervention by the Union Army.
</P>
<P>
   We are led to admire the Fifth Avenue palaces of ``Vanderbilt,
Morgan and the other tycoons'' who built wealth in the early 20th
century _ but also to cringe at the ghastly tenements captured by
Jacob Riis's ``How the Other Half Lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The contrasts are drawn clearly but not crassly. Whitman isn't
made to seem naive or stupid for focusing on the rosy side of life.
(The passages from his ``Crossing Brooklyn Ferry,'' as read
off-camera by Spalding Gray, will bring tears to all but the steely
eyed.) Nor is Morgan painted as evil for hoarding money when so
many had none.
</P>
<P>
   All these characters, properties, views, traits _ they're all a
part of the swirl of the city, and Burns views them on their own
terms and for how each contributed to the velocity of the gust.
</P>
<P>
   Part 5 ends in 1931, with the ambivalent triumph of the Empire
State Building, soaring splendidly into the sky, but with
half-vacant offices, at the start of the Great Depression. F. Scott
Fitzgerald stares out from its towers and _ as he writes in his
essay ``My Lost City'' _ sees ``with dismay what he had never
suspected, that the city was not the endless succession of canyons
that he had supposed but that it had limits. . . . And with the
awful realization that New York was a city after all and not a
universe, the whole shining edifice that he had reared in his
imagination came crashing to the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a weird finale. It might make some wonder how much the
concept of New York that they've been imbibing in the previous 10
hours _ an all-enveloping land of magic and mayhem that does seem a
universe all its own _ has been an edifice reared in Ric Burns's
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   This tangle might be resolved in the sequel _ yes, a Part 6,
subtitled ``New York and the World,'' spanning the years 1931-2000
(all in two hours!), to be broadcast in the spring. For now,
though, the first five parts, which air Sunday through Thursday
from 9 to 11 p.m. on Channel 2, provide more genuine human drama
than anyone had any business to expect.

EARNEST `DOGMA' A FILM TO BELIEVE IN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
DOGMA 
Written and directed by: Kevin Smith 
Starring: Ben Affleck, George Carlin, Matt Damon, Linda Fiorentino,
Janeane Garofalo, Salma Hayek, Jason Lee, Jason Mewes, Alan
Rickman, Chris Rock, Smith 
Running time: 125 minutes 
Rated: R (strong language including sex-related dialogue, violence,
crude humor and some drug content) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because it tweaks conventional holy images, ``Dogma''
predictably has been attacked as blasphemous. But it's a film that
only a sincere believer could make. Or would want to. Kevin Smith,
who wrote and directed it and plays an off-the-wall prophet, thus
weighs in alongside such serious grapplings with faith and belief
as ``Hail, Mary,'' ``The Last Temptation of Christ,'' and
``Priest.'' The difference is that while Smith struggles just as
earnestly as the makers of those films to renew his belief in
Christianity, ``Dogma'' is a lot more scatologically funny.
</P>
<P>
   Good thing, that. Its outrageous humor saves it from its own
earnestness. It's a sweet, clunky film that's so eager to air its
theological ponderings that it isn't afraid to seem a bit of a
bore. It's a low-budget film that looks like a low-budget film
except for the snazzy wings on the renegade angels played by Ben
Affleck and Matt Damon _ two pairs of the very best avian
appendages in angel movie history. Affleck and Damon interrupted
the shooting of ``Dogma'' in Pittsburgh to fly to Hollywood for
their ``Good Will Hunting'' Academy Awards. So ``Dogma'' is a cusp
film for them. It finds them still at work in the filmmaking
trenches, pre-A list.
</P>
<P>
   They launch ``Dogma'' in bracingly cheeky fashion as fallen
angels, Affleck's Bartleby filled with rage, Damon's Loki with
mischief, playing off each other with loosey-goosey chemistry,
garbed in K-Mart chic and hooded sweatshirts. Having been exiled to
Wisconsin for centuries, they're aching to go back to heaven and
think they've found a loophole in divine law that will permit it.
There's one little catch: If they do get back, it will mean that
God is not infallible, which in turn will mean the end of humanity.
This is something the angels can live with. In fact, they get a
jump on the impending wipeout by pulling the trigger themselves on
certain selected sinners.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a counterforce is assembled to keep them from entering a
heavenly portal in New Jersey. Centering it, although she'd rather
not, is a descendant of Jesus, an abortion clinic worker played by
smoky-voiced Linda Fiorentino, at home in her character's survivor
mode, although in a refreshingly confused and consequently humble
fashion that has nothing at all in common with the dogmatic.
Prodded into activism by Alan Rickman's droll seraph, she's
assigned a couple of prophets to serve as gofers and bodyguards _
the couple seen in every Smith movie, Jason Mewes' horny,
garbage-mouthed Jay and Smith's stalwart stoner known as Silent
Bob. Among the friends and enemies they meet en route: Selma
Hayek's blocked muse, an excrement monster, Jason Lee's snazzy
demon, and Chris Rock's 13th apostle, still annoyed because Christ
owes him money.
</P>
<P>
   Except for instances when Smith veers into some theological
explication, they keep things at a lively boil while somehow
managing to make us feel the author's pain at humankind's
too-frequent moral shortfall into depressing pettiness. Even more
surprisingly, we also feel the angels' pain, especially Bartleby's,
at being estranged from God. ``Dogma'' doesn't always cover its
self-assigned territory gracefully or sparklingly, although it ends
on a note of creative uprush as Affleck's dark angel confronts
Alanis Morissette's God in all Her quirky grandeur. Still, it's a
small miracle that it covers the ground at all, amusing us with its
transformations into the vernacular and the vulgate, winning us
over simply by virtue of how much it really cares. Raunchy
'tudefest apart, ``Dogma'' has that rarest of qualities in movies
that think of themselves as religious. I'm talking about the vision
thing. And the ability to make morality entertaining.

`TRAIN OF LIFE' IS WORTH THE TRIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
TRAIN OF LIFE 
Written and directed by: Radu Mihaileanu 
Starring: Lionel Abelanski, Rufuscq, Clement Harari, Michael
Muller, Agathe de la Fontaine and Bruno Abraham-Kremer 
Running time: 143 minutes 
Rated: R (Brief nudity, sexual situations) 
In French, with subtitles 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not all that long after ``Life Is Beautiful'' won audiences'
hearts and Hollywood awards, ``Train of Life,'' another
phantasmagorical tale of life among the Nazis, is upon us. This one
works much better. Writer/director Radu Mihaileanu shuffles humor
and harsh reality, and comes up with an illuminating film with
layers of conflict. Tension lingers constantly, and yet there is
joy to be found. (There is some bitterness on Mihaileanu's part
vis-a-vis ``Life Is Beautiful'' director-star Roberto Benigni;
Mihaileanu says he let Benigni read his script in 1996 and offered
him a lead role. Benigni considered it, but turned it down.)
</P>
<P>
   The premise: It's 1941 and Jewish villagers in an Eastern
European town have heard rumors about Jews being deported by train
to concentration camps. Fearing this, the village idiot (or
visionary) Shlomo (Lionel Abelanski) comes up with a plan. They
procure their own train, costume some of the potential deportees in
Nazi uniforms and put them in charge, pretend they're being
shepherded to a camp, but instead bolt toward Palestine (by way of
Russia) and freedom. Oh, with an ``engineer'' who's never driven a
train. Sounds plausible, eh?
</P>
<P>
   Of course not. Mihaileanu, a Romanian refugee, asks you to
accept a number of preposterous suppositions _ from the main theme
to the ``Fiddler on the Roof'' kind of joie de vivre to the idea
that Shlomo can stand on top of a train car as it whizzes through
the countryside _ but stick with him. There are some wonderful
moments _ some tense, some fanciful _ along the way and a
gut-wrenching payoff that makes sense of it all. (Think ``The Sixth
Sense.'') ``Train of Life'' won the Audience Award at this year's
Sundance Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   So, who are the lucky folks who get to play Nazis? The village
elders, led by the rabbi (Clement Harari), look for volunteers. ``I
couldn't,'' says the respected woodworker Mordechai (Rufus), citing
poor health, ``but thanks for asking.'' He is appointed Nazi
commander. A man is brought in to teach German to the Jews. The
Yiddish-speaking Jews try to get their tongues around the guttural
language. The difference? German is ``rigid and sad,'' explains the
teacher. ``Yiddish makes fun of German.'' The fake Germans try to
perfect their calls of ``Sieg Heil!,'' to comic effect. Down the
road a piece, Mordechai seems to have taken a little too
wholeheartedly to the Nazi persona _ the fake Nazis ride in
comfort, the Jews do not _ suggesting horrible things about power.
</P>
<P>
   Along the journey, this ghost train faces the threat of being
blown up by Resistance fighters, who think the train is the real
deal, and of being stopped by Nazis, who suspect everything is not
on the up-and-up. There is a rewarding interlude when persecuted
Gypsies engage the Jews, and partake in a festive dinner and dance,
sharing music and cultures. The only real misfire is a tiresome
subplot about a rejected suitor, Yossi (Michael Muller), who turns
into an irritable communist and ferments revolt. This does,
however, lead to a sharply funny confrontation between the rabbi
and the atheist Yossi, as they argue about God. ``God exists! God
doesn't exist! Who cares!'' exclaims Shlomo, again playing the wise
fool. They've got a mission here, and that is to live. The foes
hug.
</P>
<P>
   ``Train of Life'' is a long movie, and there are some
kitschy-cutesy stretches, but whatever you do, don't leave when you
think it's over. Hang on. There's a kicker that reverberates
deeply, and will make you reevaluate what you've just seen.

PANIC WON'T GET JAMMED UP BY A GENRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jam bands.
</P>
<P>
   The term won't go away, so why fight it?
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't have their whole lifetime to describe something,
but it's no big deal. We can live with the term,'' says John (J.B.)
Bell, singer/guitarist/songwriter with Widespread Panic, an Athens,
Ga. group which is near the top of the jam list with Phish and the
Allman Brothers Band.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basis is improvisation, in the sense of playing off of
each other,'' says Bell. ``There's more freedom to it. Then again,
you've got some folks really going after the music in an
exploratory form _ and others who hear `jam band' and say, `Oh,
we'll become that.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So there are some acts out there that are Flock-of-Seagulling
us,'' he adds, referring to a trendy new wave band from 20 years
ago that flamed out quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Widespread Panic is, despite its name, a low-key jam band
(``We're not trying to glamorize ourselves in some big rock 'n'
roll identity''). But it's also a band very much into taking
chances _ an impressive achievement after being together for 15
years.
</P>
<P>
   The new Panic disc, `` `Til the Medicine Takes,'' is rooted in
lively, Southern-spiced rock and funk, but also makes room for some
turntable scratching, some bluegrassy banjo, some gospel (aided by
singer Dottie Peoples), and some ragtime, with New Orleans guests
the Dirty Dozen Brass Band.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time we said, `Let's not just be a band playing songs,
but let's make believe that we're taking a further step in Never
Never Land,'' Bell says, offering a Peter Pan reference.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we felt we approached these things in credible fashion. We
felt, `Let's bring in these elements, but no go overboard.' . . .
We felt we shouldn't be constrained. Personally, I like a little
variety when I see a band.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been trying to keep things fresh from the very first
days we played together,'' Bell adds. ``But if we were running
around struggling to recapture the sound we first had, we'd go
nuts. You see a lot of bands doing that. They repeat something
until it gets old. We always knew the deal was to have fun now,
because it might not be there later.''

A SWEDISH SONGBIRD GOES POP FOR THE HOLIDAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ ``It was not my choice to train my voice for classical
singing,'' says Anne-Sophie von Otter, one of the ranking singers
of today. ``But when I started to take singing lessons, my voice
broadened, and I had to face what the possibilities of my voice
were. If I had another life to live, I might choose another way of
pursuing a singing career.''
</P>
<P>
   The Swedish mezzo-soprano is one of the most versatile singers
before the public today, excelling in early music, opera, oratorio,
and the recital literature; her new Christmas album for Deutsche
Grammophon suggests, as she herself does, that she might have made
her name as a pop star.
</P>
<P>
   Von Otter is familiar to music lovers because of her CDs and
operatic videos _ her song records (Grieg, Korngold, Schubert,
Schumann, Sibelius, Late Romantic, and Swedish songs) in particular
have captured the imagination of the public, and of the committees
that bestow international recording prizes. But von Otter has been
in Boston only once before, when she sang Mahler's ``Das Lied von
der Erde'' with the Boston Symphony Orchestra under James Levine in
1994. Her fans must be eager to hear her, because her appearance
with Reinhard Goebel and Musica Antiqua Koeln Sunday in Jordan Hall
is ``sold out to the rafters'' according to the sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from Stockholm, where her children, 8 and 11, were
clamoring for her attention at bedtime recently, von Otter said
early music has been with her all throughout her career.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first moved to Stockholm and started working properly
on my voice, I sang very actively as a chorus singer, and my
favorite choir was the Bach Choir, which is still very good and
very active. Also I was part of a quartet that sang Renaissance and
Baroque music. My first work as a soloist was in baroque music, the
Bach Passions, and things like that, and my first opera was a
baroque opera. It was the music I loved listening to most of all,
especially to those discs by Nikolaus Harnoncourt, and this kind of
music is still one of my great loves.''
</P>
<P>
   With Goebel and Musica Antiqua Koeln, von Otter has recorded two
discs, a Handel album and a collection of ``Lamenti'' that remains
a local bestseller at Tower Records two years after its release.
``I've worked together quite a lot with Musica Antiqua Koeln. We
did a Handel pastiche at the Drottningholm Court Theater with
Barbara Bonney and my husband, Benny Fredrickson, directed it. We
did a `Lamenti' concert before the recording and the Handel record,
and some concerts _ not that many. I do find Reinhard Goebel a
wonderfully dynamic and very musical person and I am looking
forward to this tour very much. It's a short tour, only three
concerts, because I do not want to be away from my family for too
long again _ I've just been in Paris for four months of Gluck's
`Alceste.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Von Otter matches the diversity of her repertory with an
extraordinary palette of vocal colors and timbres, which she is
careful not to mix up. ``Obviously you do not rush from singing
Octavian in `Der Rosenkavalier' to Monteverdi's `L'Incoronazione di
Poppea.' I do not find it difficult to go back to early music; it
just takes a few days to adjust the voice up and down, to go
wherever you're going. I enjoy changing my repertory.''
</P>
<P>
   Von Otter's fans may not even recognize her voice on her new
Christmas album, ``Home for Christmas'' _ she sounds like Judy
Collins; also Duke Ellington's Swedish muse, the extraordinary
soprano Alice Babs, comes to mind occasionally. Von Otter takes
this as a compliment. ``Alice Babs made a record of Bach's `Anna
Magdalena Notebook,' and when I was young, I used to love that _
and played it over and over again. She must be 75 or something by
now, but she did a couple of concerts last year and came out with a
new CD sounding fresh as a daisy; she still has the same girlish,
fresh voice. My favorite singer when I was growing up was Julie
Andrews, and I still love that kind of clear fresh voice. People
like Joni Mitchell and Judy Collins I enjoyed as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Von Otter says she didn't want to make another conventionally
operatic Christmas album. ``So many Christmas albums by classical
singers make the songs and carols sound like film-score music; the
singers belt it out, and I don't feel the records sound as if they
were made with a lot of love. I didn't want to churn out a
Christmas album. The music is too beautiful, the message too
lovely, not to do something personal, something with some thought
behind it, a sense of humor, and a twinkle in the eye.'' Von Otter
manages to sound intimate even in Adam's ``Cantique de Noel'' (``O
Holy Night''). The mezzo responds to this comment with laughter.
``It's almost impossible to sing that intimately. The arranger
wanted to avoid doing anything big, but neither of us was happy
with our first attempt _ in the key we tried at first, I had to
sing it a little bit too big. But then we took it down a tone or
so, and I was able to sing it differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Von Otter sings a number of American Christmas songs, like
``White Christmas,'' and she does it with a convincing accent.
``Well, they'd sound pretty strange in the queen's English,
wouldn't they?'' she says. ``I believe strongly in adding the
flavor that suits the song in question.''
</P>
<P>
   The Paris ``Alceste'' was a Robert Wilson production conducted
by John Eliot Cardiner that was also recorded. ``Alceste is a
fantastic part, very much on the heavy side for me, because it is
associated with a higher and more dramatic voice than mine. We did
it in a version that Sir Charles Mackerras arranged for Janet
Baker. I did not feel that Robert Wilson made me stand still all
the time _ I enjoyed it very much, and it was quite good for my
singing to be so concentrated on not throwing myself around. This
role is so difficult that it helped me to have the enormous
concentration on my body that Robert Wilson required. I don't think
it was quite the same concept as his earlier productions with
Jessye Norman; Jessye Norman and I are slightly different!''
</P>
<P>
   Von Otter also recently sang a run of Monteverdi's
``L'Incoronazione di Poppea'' in Aix-en-Provence. She particularly
enjoyed working with Lorraine Hunt. ``It isn't often that two
mezzos get to sing in the same opera; I was Nero and she was
Ottavia.''
</P>
<P>
   Her next venture is a Handel album, and she plans a return to
the Metropolitan Opera in 2002, where she will reprise one of her
famous trouser roles, Idamante in Mozart's ``Idomeneo.'' ``James
Levine has put together a very good cast, and it is one of his
favorite pieces, and he wants it back again.'' The grapevine is
already buzzing about her decision to add ``Carmen'' to her
repertory two years from now. ``Alceste was a big adventure, and my
next big adventure will be Carmen. Nobody knows what the outcome
will be, but I'm looking forward to the production at Glyndebourne,
which will be directed by a young man named David McVicker; they
say that everything he touches turns to gold, and I hope it's true.
Carmen is not an obvious role for me. My height is always an issue
if I'm not playing a man! Another issue is how people imagine my
personality. I do look very fair and Scandinavian, and nothing
about me looks Spanish or Gypsy, so I am going to need a very good
wig, costume, and makeup!''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday afternoon von Otter will sing a Vivaldi cantata,
``Cessate, ormai, cessate.'' ``It's about an unhappy man with
severe love problems, so I'm a man in it again. And then I'm going
to sing a short cantata by Bertali that Reinhard found in a chest
of drawers someplace, maybe in Uppsala, here in Sweden; it's about
a queen lamenting the death of her king. There's a gorgeous piece
by Monteverdi to open the whole thing, and I hope I'll get to sing
some encores _ I'm bringing some Handel with me! I have wanted to
come back to Boston to sing again, that's for sure.''

VIRTUAL VOICE SPEAKS IN TONGUES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Recently I purchased ViaVoice so that I could
dictate my sermons. No matter what I do or say, how slowly or
softly or loudly I try, I keep getting a message that says ViaVoice
cannot understand all of my words.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mumbles
</P>
<P>
   DEAR MUMBLES: I hate to contradict all those nifty TV
commercials that make it seem like everybody can carry on
meaningful conversations with their computers, but it just isn't so
yet. You might as well be talking to your toaster.
</P>
<P>
   Voice-recognition systems _ at least those that normal consumers
can afford _ are novelties that produce accurate results only when
you follow instructions to the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the last time you saw a movie where everybody was
speaking with British accents? You didn't have any idea what
anybody was saying until halfway through the film, but you
eventually got used to the goofy voices. The software has to get
used to your voice, too.
</P>
<P>
   All voice programs have some sort of training module, where you
recite pre-defined phrases. The better ones continue to learn
heuristically as you use them or repeat the training sessions. But
even if you've spent days training your program, it's not going to
know what you're saying if you start mumbling or putting emphasis
on the wrong syllables. You must learn to speak in a strong, clear,
bland monotone with no hint of emotion in your voice. Of course,
then you might be mistaken for Al Gore or Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   If that still doesn't work, make sure your hardware is up to
snuff. You generally need more memory and a faster chip than most
packages say you do, but you also need a decent microphone, and you
have to have it positioned the same distance from your mouth every
time you use it.
</P>
<P>
   Your software probably has some sort of utility to fine-tune
microphone settings, but double-check your sound card's recording
capability. You should be able to record a short phrase or two
using Windows' built-in Sound Recorder (it's in Accessories). If
the playback sounds like you're gargling with razor blades, you've
located the problem.
</P>
<P>
   I'd tend to rely on voice software to make notes rather than to
create a finished document. It certainly couldn't be any worse than
my handwriting. If you want to use it to jot down your sermons,
don't be surprised if some Sunday your congregation may think
you're speaking in tongues, but that seems to have worked out
rather well for some of those TV preachers.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I used to be able to type NUMOFF in the
Autoexec.bat file to keep the Num Lock from activating when
booting. This doesn't work with Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   _ Numb Lock
</P>
<P>
   DEAR NUMB: All I want to know is which bonehead thought
everybody in the world wants that stupid numeric keypad on by
default. You can change that in the computer's setup program (oh,
go read the manual) or get a freeware utility to do it each time
you boot. Try a package called JW-Utils at www.zdnet.com/swlib if
you can't find Numoff.com somewhere.
</P>

software. That would explain why nothing he writes makes any sense.

<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ ``Boxing,'' Evander Holyfield mused this week, ``is
a replica of what life is _ up and down. It's been going up and
down since they invented it. It goes down, then something gives it
a boost and it comes up. It's not going to fade away. But right now
it definitely needs something.''
</P>
<P>
   He was in the final stages of preparation for his rematch with
Lennox Lewis in Las Vegas Saturday night, a contest intended to
produce an undisputed heavyweight champion of the world.
</P>
<P>
   And the one thing that the two fighters agreed on during this
week's pre-fight publicity blitz was that sport itself is in
serious danger of ending the century on the canvas.
</P>
<P>
   As the hour draws near, Holyfield-Lewis II has come to seem less
of a mere title decider than boxing's last best hope for
redemption.
</P>
<P>
   As Holyfield implied, prizefighting has never been without its
shadows. But this year has been spent in a gathering gloom,
starting with the attempt by Mike Tyson to break Axel Schulz's arm
in a clinch last January and running all the way through to the
ludicrous finish of Tyson's most recent encounter, when he was
disqualified for hitting Orlin Norris after the bell ended the
first round.
</P>
<P>
   In between came the fiasco of the first Holyfield-Lewis fight,
in March, when a poor contest ended in a controversial draw.
</P>
<P>
   That was followed by the much anticipated but similarly
disappointing world welterweight championship fight between Oscar
De La Hoya and Felix Trinidad, when De La Hoya tried to win the
fight in reverse gear.
</P>
<P>
   And then, last month, came Naseem Hamed's unseemly display of
body-slamming against Cesar Soto in a fight more suited to a WWF
bill.
</P>
<P>
   When they pay their money, boxing fans know that they lay
themselves open to the risk of sudden and sometimes mystifying
disappointment. Such sensations go back to Sonny Liston quitting on
his stool against Cassius Clay, and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   By the nature of the sport, nothing can be guaranteed. But this
year's procession of embarrassments resembles a systematic cheating
of the public, and the public has begun to show its resentment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year's fights have left the fans in a very bad state of
mind,'' Emanuel Steward, Lewis's highly respected trainer, said
Thursday. ``They have a lot of questions. Right now they're on the
brink of deserting boxing, and I understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   The fans would not have been reassured by the last week's news
of the criminal indictments naming the IBF president, Bob Lee, and
three other officials, who are accused by the U.S. Attorney and the
FBI of taking bribes to rig the rankings in order to produce the
match-ups desired by certain top promoters over a 13-year period.
</P>
<P>
   This week a New York State Senate committee recommended the
creation of a national body to regulate the sport and prevent it,
in the words of its chairman, Senator Roy Goodman, from
``degenerating into a meaningless and violent show.''
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously the Attorney General of Nevada, Frankie Sue Del
Papa, announced that her office will be working with the state's
Athletic Commission, the sanctioning body for Saturday's fight, on
an investigation into the way the sport is organized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say what it is that's wrong,'' Holyfield said in his
last pre-fight interview, knowing that the Miami offices of his
promoter, Don King, had been searched as part of the FBI
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It involves a lot of different components. People should come
together and decide what's best for the sport. The boxers, the TV
people, the managers, the promoters, the writers. It needs a
collective effort to make it a better sport for everybody,
including the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   In Lennox Lewis's view, the unification of the three
championships _ Holyfield's World Boxing Association and
International Boxing Federation belts and his own World Boxing
Council title _ would be a first step, providing a single
figurehead behind which the sport could regroup and reunite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of the governing bodies has its own agenda,'' he said.
``The sport needs to be cleaned up so that it's not as dodgy as it
is now. My hope is to be a good ambassador for boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   But a good ambassador would not produce, by himself, the sort of
root-and-branch reform that boxing needs.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will one great fight be enough to refurbish boxing's image.
``But at least it would give a little hope,'' Manny Steward said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between the bad decision over the Lewis fight, and the De La
Hoya-Trinidad fight not being a damn thing but a foot race, and
then to come back with Tyson, people feel they've been wasting
their money. So this fight really could help push them one way or
another.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 800 IF NEEDED, OR CONTINUE TO 925) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   The sport's image needs Holyfield and Lewis to produce a contest
worthy of inclusion in the all-time highlights reel. When Marc
Ratner, the serious-minded head of the Nevada Athletic Commission,
called it ``a pivotal fight for boxing as we head into the new
millennium'' at Wednesday's press conference, he was not merely
indulging in the usual hyperbole.
</P>
<P>
   Both fighters are clearly aware of their wider responsibility,
and have the capacity to produce the goods.
</P>
<P>
   But if they find, when they are alone together in the ring, that
self-interest once more overcomes the urge to create a spectacle,
then the arena's cleaning staff can sweep up what remains of the
sport's integrity and throw it out along with the rest of the
trash. &QL;

Council title _ would be a first step, providing a single
figurehead behind which the sport could regroup and reunite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of the governing bodies has its own agenda,'' he said.
``The sport needs to be cleaned up so that it's not as dodgy as it
is now. My hope is to be a good ambassador for boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   But a good ambassador would not produce, by himself, the sort of
root-and-branch reform that boxing needs.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will one great fight be enough to refurbish boxing's image.
``But at least it would give a little hope,'' Manny Steward said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between the bad decision over the Lewis fight, and the De La
Hoya-Trinidad fight not being a damn thing but a foot race, and
then to come back with Tyson, people feel they've been wasting
their money. So this fight really could help push them one way or
another.'' &QL;

</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   The sport's image needs Holyfield and Lewis to produce a contest
worthy of inclusion in the all-time highlights reel. When Marc
Ratner, the serious-minded head of the Nevada Athletic Commission,
called it ``a pivotal fight for boxing as we head into the new
millennium'' at Wednesday's press conference, he was not merely
indulging in the usual hyperbole.
</P>
<P>
   Both fighters are clearly aware of their wider responsibility,
and have the capacity to produce the goods.
</P>
<P>
   But if they find, when they are alone together in the ring, that
self-interest once more overcomes the urge to create a spectacle,
then the arena's cleaning staff can sweep up what remains of the
sport's integrity and throw it out along with the rest of the
trash. &QL;

<P>
   &LR; We wanted to know what distinguishes the five actors who have
played James Bond over the years, stamping the character with
unique interpretations of the suave and deadly superspy. So we
asked the man who knows everything (and the only guy who's worked
with them all): Desmond Llewelyn, the wry, 85-year-old Welshman who
has played Q, British Intelligence's irritable master gadget-maker,
in 17 of the 19 official Bond films.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sean (Connery), being the first, was, of course, the
prototype,'' Llewelyn says. ``People who saw Roger Moore first
prefer him. He made Bond much lighter because he couldn't copy
Sean's visceral charisma, naturally. So he made him more jokey.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then poor old (George) Lazenby,'' he says, referring to
the underequipped, one-shot star of the sixth Bond film, ``On Her
Majesty's Secret Service.'' ``I mean, he just wasn't an actor. But
he wasn't that bad; if he'd behaved properly, he might have been a
very good Bond. But he acted like an idiot on the set.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we had Timothy Dalton (1987's ``The Living Daylights''
and 1989's ``Licence to Kill''), who to the Bond aficionados, of
course, is the nearest to Ian Fleming's Bond. Fleming said that
Bond was what every man wants to be but knows damn well that he
can't be, and he was a very unpleasant character. Timothy made no
concessions whatsoever to the movies, he just made him a really
hard man. So a lot of people, even if they thought they were
wonderful films, didn't think his really felt like Bond films.
There wasn't enough fantasy in them at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now Pierce (Brosnan), I think, has gone back to Sean in a way,
except Sean very seldom looked really beaten up. But Pierce does
for that second after a fight _ but then he straightens his tie and
is back to normal, which of course you have to be, you've got to
remain romantic whatever happens to you. But he does show pain. And
he has the best connections of any Bond with the opposite sex.''

   REPUBS-CONGRESS (Washington) _ In compromise after compromise,
Republicans have been giving in to President Clinton in the final
weeks of this budget fight. Yet unlike past years, there has been
no rebellion, so far, from conservatives. The reason is that the
GOP began the year so weak and so fractured, their only goal is
survival. By Alison Mitchell.

   &UR; NATIONAL GENERAL &LR;  (``a'' code)

</P>
<P>
   SC-CONFEDERATE-FLAG (Charleston, S.C.) _ As Charleston has a
ceremony to bury confederate soldiers whose bodies were found in a
construction site, the state still wrestles with ghosts of another
kind. Although Gov. Jim Hodges has offered a compromise that is the
closest two sides have gotten in years, there is still a standoff
about the confederate flag flying over the capitol and there is
still a tourism boycott by the NAACP. By David Firestone.

<P>
   COLO-SCHOOL-SHOOTING (Denver) _ At a sentencing hearing for the
man who sold guns to the two students who staged the high school
attack, a transcript is read from a video that the two boys made

By Michael Janofsky.
</P>
<P>
   COUNCIL-OF-CHURCHES (Cleveland) _ On paper, it's one of
America's grandest religious alliances, representing 35
denominations with 50 million members and styling itself as ``the
primary national expression of the movement for Christian unity.''
But as it celebrates its 50th anniversary and names Andrew Young as
its head, the National Council of Churches is in trouble
financially and internal squabbling over mainline churches and
newer versions has left its mission unclear. By Gustav Niebuhr.

</P>
<P>
   ECON-REPORT (Undated) _ Growth in productivity surged in the
third quarter, while a rise in labor costs moderated. Productivity,
defined as the amount of output for each hour of work, rose at a
4.2 percent annual rate _ the biggest gain in 18 months.The gain
helped slow the growth of unit labor costs to 0.6 percent, the
lowest rate since the fourth quarter of 1998. The numbers suggest
that productivity gains remain more than sufficient to offset
rising wages amid the tightest United States labor market in three
decades. In a separate report, retail sales were unchanged in
October, but excluding cars and trucks, sales rose a more robust
0.5 percent. By Louis Uchitelle.

<P>
   CANADA-U.S.-INVEST (Winnipeg, Manitoba) _ Taking advantage of a
neighboring economy newly open to foreign investment and a Canadian
dollar trading near historic lows, Americans are snapping up
Canadian companies at a record pace. At the same time, oddly
enough, Canadians are funneling their money across the border in
volumes evocative of capital flight from Latin America. By James
Brooke.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-INTERNET (Hong Kong) _ Entrepreneurs and investors in the
Internet have been nervously watching the state of talks between
the United States and China on China's entry into the World Trade
Organization. China's Internet industry has been in state of
suspension since September, when the nation's top communications
official suddenly reaffirmed a longstanding ban on foreign
investment in Chinese Internet service providers. While a trade
agreement is not expected to deal specifically with the Internet,
analysts said it could clarify Beijing's stance toward its bubbling
online industry. By Mark Landler.

   plane carrying 21 passengers and three crew Friday en route to

</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-ALBANIANS _ PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ The problem of ethnic
violence in Kosovo province that United Nations thought we be
abated by now, is far from it. The Kosovar Albanians that NATO
warplanes bombed Yugoslavia to rescue are apparently doing to the
Serbians, what was being done to them. This is making things very
complicated, and increasing the tension between the UN, Kosovar
Albanians, Russians and just about everybody else. It also makes
things tough for the people trying to raise money from private
donors, who may have their desire to help Kosovo chilled by the
sense that the Albanians are no better than the Serbs. For the
long-term, the ethnic tensions threaten any chance of Kosovo's
remaining a part of Serbia, while making it difficult to schedule
an election for Kosovo that would be considered reflective of both
ethnic populations. (Roughton, Cox News Service). 30. WITH PHOTO.

   CLINTON-EUROPE _ WASHINGTON _ President Clinton leaves Sunday,
Nov. 14, for a 10-day swing through southeastern Europe,
intersection of U.S. interests in the Balkans, the Caucuses, the
Mediterranean and the Mideast. Journeying first to Greece, then
Turkey, Italy and Bulgaria, Clinton will touch on a range of issues
seen vital to U.S. economic and security interests, from
peacekeeping and oil to terrorism, exports and the future of nearby
Russia. Sets up Clinton's first visit to Turkey. (Deans, Cox News

   CARIBBEAN-ROCKET _ ST. CROIX, Virgin Islands _ A Texas aerospace
company with a lease to launch commercial satellites from a tiny
rocky island in the eastern Caribbean has drawn the ire of
environmentalists, who say the operation could wipe out the
unpopulated island's wildlife. Beal Aerospace Technologies of
Frisco, Texas wants to assemble its rockets on St. Croix and launch
them from Sombrero Island, a 95-acre slab of rock that belongs to
Anguilla, a British territory. Cash-strapped local governments
support the project for the jobs and investment it would bring. But
the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds in London is opposed,
as are some local groups, saying pollution, noise and the threat of
accidents could cause more harm than good. (Williams, Cox News

   WATERWAR _ ATLANTA _ President Clinton's appointee to the

Georgia and Alabama and Florida warned Friday that the talks appear
to be headed for failure. Lindsay Thomas, a former Georgia
congressman and head of the state Chamber of Commerce, said that
the complexities of the water dispute and unyielding demands from
various groups for more water may doom the negotiations that have
been taking place for nearly two years to divide up the waters of
the Chattahoochee and other rivers. ``This dispute could very well
be settled by a federal judge or the Supreme Court who never have
laid eyes on these rivers,'' he said. (Seabrook, Atlanta

   ANGELS _ PENSACOLA, Fla. _ Still mourning the death of two
pilots, Pensacola hosts the final performance of the Blue Angels
this year. It's a town that closely identifies with the precision
flying team: the mayor is a former Blue Angels team leader. After
the South Georgia crash, the town bought 20,000 blue ribbons to
distribute to commemorate the dead fliers. They were gone in a
snap, and the city had to order more. (Osinski, Atlanta

   MUSLIM-PRAYER _ ATLANTA _ Group of 33 Somalis working on an
assembly line at a high-tech firm in suburban Atlanta say they were
forced to quit after their boss wouldn't allow them to take a
five-minute break to pray. As devout Muslims, they consider it
their duty to pray at least five times a day, one of those times
while they are at work. Apparently their old boss let them pray,
but a new boss said no. Group tried to negotiate for two weeks with
new boss, but to no avail. Group is considering filing EEOC
complaint on grounds of religious discrimination. National Islamic
group in Washginton is helping them file complaint. (Kurylo,

   CONFEDERATE-BURIAL _ CHARLESTON, S.C. _ The Confederate Heritage

   LIBERAL-CHURCH _ DECATUR, Ga. _ The 86-year-old Oakhurst Baptist
Church in Decatur lost more than half its members when it decided

Southern Baptist in the 1970s when it ordained women. And now, it's
being kicked out of the Georgia Baptist Convention for accepting
gays and lesbians. We do a profile of the church to run before the

   &LR; Once more unto the breach ...
</P>
<P>
   The 19th official James Bond movie, ``The World Is Not Enough,''
opens Friday, begging thenot-so-burning question, so what's new?
</P>
<P>
   After all, over 37 years and 20 previous movies (``Casino
Royale'' and ``Never Say Never Again'' were the two made outside of
Broccoli family control), the British spy films have settled into a
formula as rigid as it is successful. Monomaniacal villains,
decorative babes, exotic locations, ridiculously extended stunt
sequences, bad puns and gadgets galore, shaken martinis _ it all
spells big box office. The last two outings, ``GoldenEye'' and
``Tomorrow Never Dies,'' each grossed around $350 million
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   You don't mess with that kind of success much. But for his third
outing as supersuave Agent 007, Pierce Brosnan wanted to at least,
well, feel something.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this one, we've hit a new chord, or at least one I
haven't hit in the last two movies,'' the 46-year-old Irish actor
reckons. ``I think we've gone back to what the original premise of
the character was in some respects. And at the beginning of this
one, I said that I couldn't do another `Tomorrow Never Dies.' I
wanted to do what's important to the character, what his
relationships mean to him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``World's'' plotline sends Bond out to the Caspian Sea republic
of Azerbaijan, where Elektra King (French actress Sophie Marceau),
the beautiful heiress to an oil- company fortune, is trying to
build a pipeline to the West through Asia Minor. It's presumed
Russian interests might be behind attempts to sabotage the project
and the successful assassination of Elektra's father.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever is really pulling the strings has hired the most
implacable of cat's-paws, Valentin Zukovsky (``The Full Monty's''
Robert Carlyle). The ruthless Russian has a bullet lodged in his
skull that is slowly killing him. But it also makes him impervious
to pain, which renders him a particularly hard guy to frighten or
fight. Eventually, everyone from Bond's boss M (Judi Dench) to
halter-topped American nuclear scientist Christmas Jones (``Wild
Things'' vixen Denise Richards) gets in on the action.
</P>
<P>
   But, wait! Didn't Brosnan say he wanted this film to be more
than just action? That, one reckons, is why somebody called Michael
Apted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose the reason I was brought in was to try to beef up
the drama a little bit, maybe concentrate on story a bit more,''
says the English documentarian and director of such fact-based
feature films as ``Coal Miner's Daughter'' and ``Gorillas in the
Mist.'' ``I think that's why they wanted a drama director rather
than an action director, although I still wondered why they wanted
to see me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bond franchise already had a longstanding team of
craftspeople in place, and Apted was happy to leave much of the
wide-scope action footage _ a powerboat chase down the Thames
River, the series' umpteenth ski sequence in the French Alps _ to
Terry Madden's capable second-unit crew (which shot 104 days to the
Apted unit's 109).
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, you have to deliver what people want; you can't
start changing it to Chekhov,'' Apted notes. ``After doing the
kinds of films that I've done, it was thrilling to be given these
new challenges. I was very dependent on other people _ the stunt
coordinator, the special effects coordinatior _ but once you kind
of got the hang of it, it was really exciting to add that string to
your bow, as it were.''
</P>
<P>
   The documentary-maker in Apted also influenced ``World's''
somewhat unorthodox definition of exotic locales. Instead of the
standard Mediterranean or tropical settings, he took the film to
the polluted oilfields of the former Soviet Caucasus and to Bilbao,
Spain, where the acclaimed new Guggenheim Museum could dominate the
opening scene's background.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days, exotic was being on a beach, but that's not
exotic anymore,'' Apted figures. ``When I saw these huge oil cities
built on the Caspian, and the Guggenheim, that redefined exotic for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The operating question was, however, how much redefinition can
such a formula-dependent enterprise take?
</P>
<P>
   ``You're never sure what all the elements are to a Bond movie's
success,'' admits Michael G. Wilson, who with step-sister Barbara
Broccoli has been producing Bond films since before the death of
series originator Albert ``Cubby'' Broccoli. ``It's always
difficult, especially because we look at a variety of different
territories. The United States is only 25 to 30 percent of our
income, and you never know from one territory to another what will
or won't play for different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose you learn from your mistakes, but it's a little
harder to learn from your successes,'' Wilson continues. ``The
temptation, when you do research, is to hear what people like about
the film and to give them more, and that's usually where film
series fall apart. People will tell you what they remember about
our films, and it's action and gadgets and stuff like that. But
that's all they remember; they won't verbalize the fact that you
have a good story. But I've found that if you don't have a good
story, people will say that the picture doesn't work for them,
though they won't be able to say why.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds right. Still, Apted felt obliged to shovel on all the
elements people keep going back to James Bond movies for.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, you do the best you can with it, and if my casting
Denise Richards as a nuclear scientist makes some sleazebags laugh,
then fine,'' the director says a bit testily. ``But I have to
deliver that, I have to deliver the jiggle-vision, if you will,
like I have to deliver action and gadgets and all that. The
challenge is, can I push it and make it more interesting and more
entertaining? Nonetheless, there are certain definite features I
have to deliver.''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, the not-known-for-her-rocket-science-skills
Richards is fielding the inevitable snickers good-naturedly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talk a lot about defusing bombs in the movie, and people
have been kidding me about it,'' the glamorous actress
acknowledges. ``But I was kind of expecting that. Traditionally,
though, the women in Bond films haven't just been armpieces.
They've all been smart and most of them have had great jobs _
they're either spies or doctors or scientists. That's what's fun
about it, to be able to play a smart woman who also gets to do all
of these things. It's great to be a part of the whole history of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nice for the statuesque physicist. But there are limits,
apparently, to how fully a fantasy figure such as 007 can be
humanized.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a delicate balance,'' Brosnan admits. ``You shouldn't
find out too much about Bond personally, because the great joy of
the character is the mystique of the character. If you read Ian
Fleming's books, you glean an awful lot about him in some respects.
But he is very solitary and, above all else, a survivalist. He's
always been a ruthless killer; maybe now he's a little more
vulnerable with women.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't think he's a gentler Bond,'' Brosnan is quick to
add, lest diehard fans become alarmed. ``He's been doing his job a
long time now and he's seen a lot of killing; his life is always
under threat. Maybe he's just a bit more philosophical now than he
was before.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it is, Brosnan's interest in the character has been
sufficiently renewed for him to scotch the rumors that ``World''
will be his last Bond outing. Apted, too, had enough fun to
consider directing another franchise entry, even with the attendant
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   As for the further future of the most profitable movie series of
all time, it remains to be seen if the formula's welcome will ever
wear out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It endures and keeps itself fresh because of two phenomena,''
producer Wilson reckons. ``One is that we are contemporary films,
so as we go through time the world changes and Bond changes with
it. The other thing is that we recast the series from time to time,
and that rejuvenates it because the actors are all leading men who
bring their strong personalities to it _ which, in a way, creates
new variations on the character.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing's indefinitely open-ended, though,'' Wilson concludes.
``I think we're just as good as our last movie and that's about the
way it is. We'll come to an end some time, but I think the
character will always be around because, like Sherlock Holmes or
Superman, he's just one of those fictitious characters that
captures the public's imagination.'' &QL;

 &QL; 
 &QL;

Villain: Necros, played by Joe Don Baker. &QL;

debut for Dalton. Maryam d' Abo (as Kara Malovy) plays the cello _
and with Bond. &QL; 
Songs: Title track by a-ha; ``Where Has Everybody Gone'' by the
Pretenders. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
License to Kill: (1989) &QL;

Bond makes this one of the best. Carey Lowell (as Pam Bouvier) and
Talisa Soto (as Lupe Lamora) are the girls. &QL; 
Song: ``License to Kill'' sung by Gladys Knight. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;

 &LR;  &QL; 
GoldenEye: (1995) &QL; 
Villain: Alec Trevelyan (Sean Bean), a former colleague turned
traitor. &QL;

 &QL; 
__ Outside the realm &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Casino Royale: (1967) &QL; 
Villain: Would you believe Woody Allen? &QL; 
Of note: This Bond film originated as a one-hour TV show in 1954
and was not part of author Ian Fleming's main body of work. The
movie's a '60s trip with five directors, including John Huston.
Everybody yuks it up throughout the film, which stars Peter
Sellers, David Niven and whoever else happened to be around when
they were shooting. Ursula Andress plays Mata Bond.  &QL; 
Song: Burt Bacharach and Hal David wrote the title song. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Never Say Never Again: (1999) &QL; 
Villain: Klaus Maria Brandauer plays Largo. &QL; 
Of note: Connery returns after a 12-year absence in this remake of
``Thunderball'' (which also fell outside the MGM rights). There are
enough jokes about an aging Bond, but Connery does look a bit long
in the tooth. Barbara Carrera (as Fatima Blush) and Kim Basinger
(as Domino) are the lovely ladies. &QL; 
Song: Lani Hall sings the title track, written by Alan and Marilyn
Bergman. &QL;

FORD EXCURSION IS BIG, ROOMY AND UNWIELDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Driving all kinds of different vehicles can cause
unexpected problems. Such as confronting a vast parking lot, when I
have to stop and ask myself not only where did I park but what did
I park.
</P>
<P>
   Not a problem with the new Ford Excursion. The moment I scanned
the lot, I could see it looming, like the Queen Mary docked among a
sea of dinghies or a woolly mammoth trying to appear inconspicuous
among a herd of gazelles.
</P>
<P>
   A true behemoth, the Excursion is the world's biggest
sport-utility vehicle, somewhat dwarfing the erstwhile holder of
the claim, Chevrolet Suburban, and making Ford's former big dog,
the Expedition, look like a shrinking violet.
</P>
<P>
   Excursion stands 7 inches longer, 4 inches wider and 6 inches
taller than a Suburban, and weighs about 2,000 pounds more. It's
built from Ford's construction-site tough guy, the F-250 Super Duty
pickup truck, and comes in either two- or four-wheel drive with
engines ranging from a 5.4-liter V-8 to a powerful 6.8-liter V-10
and a monster 7.3-liter diesel V-8.
</P>
<P>
   The Excursion is the sport-ute that environmentalists love to
hate, seen as a flash point for all that is wasteful and
over-the-top in our consumer society. It's viewed by some as an
oversize, gas-guzzling air polluter, a land-yacht for
status-seekers and their families.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, see the Excursion as a successful blending of a
powerful, heavy-duty truck with a passenger vehicle, one that can
contain eight passengers and plenty of gear in spacious
surroundings, and tow 10,000 pounds (with the V-10 or diesel). It's
a truck for the great out of doors, although undoubtedly it will be
used most often for schlepping kids and groceries.
</P>
<P>
   Ford disputes the gross-polluter charge, claiming that the
technology used in the Excursion has reduced its emissions to an
acceptable level. Maybe, pound for pound.
</P>
<P>
   The gas-mileage issue is a bit harder to counter; there's no
official tally by the EPA because Excursion's gross weight is over
the limit to require a federal fuel-mileage designation. I poured
plenty of gas into the V-10 test truck, and the Excursion's
on-board computer showed that it was averaging just 10 miles per
gallon in a mix of urban and city driving. It has a 44-gallon gas
tank for good reason.
</P>
<P>
   The V-10 is one heck of an engine, however, pulling the 3{-ton
Tessie up to highway speed with a smooth rush of power. If I were a
hot-rodder, I'd be looking at this slick mill for a roadster
project.
</P>
<P>
   Other than being impressed by the engine and the excellent
automatic transmission, I was not terribly excited about the
Excursion's driveability. I had read previously some positive press
about the handling of the two-wheel-drive Excursion, but I found
the four-wheel-drive truck to be cumbersome at best.
</P>
<P>
   The ride was surprisingly rough, with the front suspension
turning every bump into a jarring hop while third-seat passengers
bounced heavily above the rear axle.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the wheel, you never lose the sense of maneuvering a big,
heavy truck, and you must alter your driving habits accordingly.
The steering is rather slow to react, despite being overboosted
with power assist, and the 4-wheel-disc brakes seemed to be taxed
to the limit in curbing the massive load of forward momentum.
</P>
<P>
   One thing's for certain, the Excursion doesn't have nearly the
handling or stopping power of the smaller Expedition, nor does it
have nearly as comfortable a ride. Expedition set a benchmark for
driveability in this class of vehicle, although I'm looking forward
to the new, improved Suburban, Tahoe and GMC Yukon that are coming
soon.
</P>
<P>
   Outward vision is great, because you're riding up there with the
semi drivers, but the Excursion's bulk allows smaller vehicles to
hide out in the blind spots. Little people, too.
</P>
<P>
   As well as supplying a good level of safety features for the
occupants, Ford has made the effort to protect other people sharing
the highway. There's a ``blocker beam'' under the front bumper to
keep the Excursion from overrunning a smaller vehicle in a rear-end
crash and a similar setup in the rear to keep a smaller vehicle
from submarining under the back bumper.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-lock brakes are standard, but side air bags are not.
Another thing I expected to see on the Excursion were gas and brake
pedals that were adjustable for shorter drivers, like they have in
the Expedition and, coming soon, in the Mercury Sable.
</P>
<P>
   The tailgate is a Dutch-door design, with the upper glass
folding up and the lower door splitting to either side, an
excellent design for rear vision and ease of loading.
</P>
<P>
   Excursion certainly has the space for hauling, especially after
removing the center seat, which comes out on rollers, creating a
cavernous cargo area. If cavernous is not big enough, the center
seats fold forward, leaving a cargo area large enough for sheets of
plywood or small bulldozers.
</P>
<P>
   The leather-bound interior of the test truck was handsome,
comfortable and workable, with a galaxy of cup holders. Leg, head
and hip room are generous in all positions.
</P>
<P>
   The Excursion is obviously not for everyone, mainly because of
its huge size (it fills a parking space completely from white line
to white line while hanging over either end). But there are plenty
of people who want them, with Ford taking more orders for the 2000
models than it originally had planned to build.
</P>
<P>
   The target markets are the wide-open spaces in Texas, Wyoming
and the like, but expect to see plenty of them coming to a shopping
center near you. You can't miss 'em. &QL;

TRICK ROPER J.W. STOKER LASSOS A SPOT IN THE COWBOY HALL OF FAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF PRINCE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEATHERFORD, Texas _ For years, cats have chased rats out of
J.W. Stoker's barn, and for that he is grateful. But rarely did he
pet the cats or talk to them.
</P>
<P>
   Until now.
</P>
<P>
   Three kittens adopted him after their mother was killed by a
coyote several weeks ago. Stoker fed the kittens, one drop of
formula at a time, and now they follow him everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   He enjoys their presence. ``They've been sleeping in the
house,'' he said. ``They won't make very good barn cats.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoker is also sleeping in his house more these days.
</P>
<P>
   For much of his life, the 72-year-old trick roper has been on
the road, hauling a horse and trailer. He has twirled ropes for
presidents, singers, movie stars and a queen, and he once got a
glimpse of a goddess.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's alongside Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, Hopalong Cassidy and
other cowboy entertainers in the National Cowboy Hall of Fame in
Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel it's the highest honor you can have,'' said Stoker, who
was inducted Oct. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Still, don't expect a cartwheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think about it that much,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stoker doesn't spend much time reflecting about small matters.
The sun comes up and goes down, and he does what needs to be done
in between, usually while chewing on a toothpick.
</P>
<P>
   His manager and assistant, Demetra Risenhoover, recently told a
visitor about Stoker's 1971 trip to perform for ``the queen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Queen Elizabeth?'' the visitor asked, looking at Stoker.
</P>
<P>
   The cowboy paused, perplexed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I don't know her name,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Risenhoover laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it was Queen Elizabeth,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Stoker's aw-shucks personality is endearing, but it might have
delayed his selection to the hallowed Hall. Lobbying for a
nomination is common, said Mitzi Riley, 71, a former trick rider
from Aledo and a member of the Hall who serves on the nominating
committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people campaign and write letters and call around,''
Riley said. ``J.W. didn't do any of that. He's cowboy modest.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoker's reserve fades, however, when he performs.
</P>
<P>
   He wears flashy cowboy outfits with colorful scarves. He tucks
his pants inside handmade boots. He stands on his horse's back and
swings a rope above his head, making it dance and whoosh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's physical, but it's stuff I've done so long it's second
nature,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After his Hall of Fame induction, Stoker headed to New York for
a rodeo. But he is more likely these days to drive to Dallas and
perform at a business conference or at a child's birthday party.
</P>
<P>
   Many rodeos are cutting costs and no longer hiring entertainers
like Stoker. That's OK, he said. He is enjoying time at home after
so many years on the road.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, Stoker bought 25 acres of ranch land near Bankhead
Highway in Weatherford. He built a large barn for his horses with a
tiny room for himself. A bed and a window-unit air conditioner kept
him happy for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, he built a three-bedroom brick house. His only
extravagance is a full-sized fiberglass horse rearing up on his
hind legs in a rock garden next to his driveway.
</P>
<P>
   The surrounding area was once little more than prickly, rocky
land, but now grand houses have popped up, including a
multimillion-dollar house across the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Makes my place look like an outhouse,'' he said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Stoker spends his time training horses, repairing fences, mowing
and talking to cats. He's not rich, but he's comfortable, and he's
proud that he made a life with a rope and a horse.
</P>
<P>
   Pictures and mementos from 60 years of rodeo performances are
stuffed haphazardly in a few boot boxes stacked in a closet. Only
with prodding does Stoker recount his past.
</P>
<P>
   He was born Sept. 30, 1927, on a Kansas farm. Several years
later, his dad gave him a Shetland pony named Peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   Infatuated with cowboys, Stoker joined the Santa Fe Trail Riders
and learned fancy riding and roping. He practiced before school,
during recess and after school and eventually became a world
champion juvenile roper. That's when a General Mills employee saw
him in 1939 at the Minnesota State Fair. The company put Stoker's
face on Wheaties boxes.
</P>
<P>
   During the Korean War, he was an entertainment specialist along
with singer Eddie Fisher, then a 21-year-old newcomer.
</P>
<P>
   The 1950s and 1960s were glorious. Singing cowboys ruled the
radios and movie theaters, and westerns such as Gunsmoke and
Bonanza dominated prime-time television.
</P>
<P>
   Rodeos were big, and almost all of them featured trick riders
and fancy ropers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, Stoker worked as an extra doing rope tricks in Marilyn
Monroe's ``Bus Stop,'' with rodeo scenes shot in Phoenix. One
morning, he was exercising his horse and noticed a pale, slight
woman sitting on the fence, watching him. They nodded, but did not
speak.
</P>
<P>
   Only later did it dawn on him that it was Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was so much smaller and so white and so thin, I just rode
by her,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He performed for presidents Harry Truman and Ronald Reagan. He
remembers Steve McQueen as ``an oddball'' and Tex Ritter as
``down-to-earth.''
</P>
<P>
   He says Clint Eastwood hired him in 1979 to do rope tricks in
the movie ``Bronco Billy.''
</P>
<P>
   The stories wind down and the sun sinks. Stoker settles into a
leather chair, tired of talking about himself. He'll watch TV
awhile, say goodnight to his horses and go to bed.
</P>
<P>
   He never married, but has no regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always happy doing what I was doing and being my own
boss,'' he said. ``I was never lonely. Everywhere I went was a
celebration.''

49ERS LOOKING FOR MORE PRODUCTION FROM WIDEOUTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JEFFRI CHADIHA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ J.J. Stokes has an idea for the San
Francisco 49ers' passing-game problems, one that his fellow wide
receivers agree with: Keep everything simple.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing against the masterful complexities of the West Coast
offense, but all that choreographed mayhem isn't helping the 49ers
these days. Stokes, Jerry Rice and Terrell Owens have only one
desire _ to have the football in their hands and be in a position
to do something with it.
</P>
<P>
   However that happens, they will gladly accept it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not talking about anything we haven't done in the past,''
Stokes said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm talking about a simple out, a smoke, a hitch, whatever. If
we run a simple rout, maybe we'll have a chance to make a big play
off of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Excuse the 49ers wide receivers for their frustrations. They
have so many reasons to be frazzled aside from the team's 3-5
record. They represent a major chunk of change for the 49ers. As a
trio, Stokes, Rice and Owens represent roughly a quarter of the
team's payroll, meaning they should feel most slighted when the
offense drones to a halt, as it has throughout this season.
</P>
<P>
   For a group of receivers that spent last season grappling with
the idea that 60 receptions wasn't a sufficient amount, this year
has been pure hell. Rice, Stokes and Owens would surely rejoice
over the days when a four-catch game would leaving them fuming.
Stokes, for one, has gone three games without amassing that many
receptions.
</P>
<P>
   Their numbers are staggering. Both Lawrence Phillips and Charlie
Garner are averaging more yards per reception than Rice, who is
gaining 9.3 yards every time he touches the ball. Owens has 25
receptions and missed two games with a high ankle sprain prior to
the bye week on Oct. 31. Stokes has 16 receptions and no
touchdowns. In 1998, this same group combined for 223 receptions.
Currently, they're on pace for 146.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get our receivers the ball,'' 49ers coach Steve
Mariucci said. ``We have some good receivers and they would like to
get involved. There was a stretch last year where we threw for 300
yards in six straight games. But that was last year's team, too.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the overwhelming problem for the 49ers. So much of last
year's magic has vanished with injuries to quarterback Steve Young
and running back Garrison Hearst and the early season shuffling of
the offensive line. The only area of the team that hasn't suffered
a major loss this season is wide receiver. Rice, Stokes and Owens
have paid the price for that.
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of the year, they haven't been able to find
a rhythm with whoever is throwing the football. First Young
succumbed to heavily blitzing, finally being knocked unconscious
and out of the lineup in Week 3. Then his successor, Jeff Garcia,
fared no better. He played well in his debut against the Tennessee
Titans but declined over the next four weeks before eventually
losing his job to Steve Stenstrom on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to put a finger on that problem,'' Garcia said.
``Over the last four weeks, we just haven't given those guys many
chances to do anything. Against Pittsburgh (a 27-6 loss Sunday), it
was really difficult. The bad weather really affected my accuracy
and I felt like I got out of synch.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't just a feeling; it was reality. In that contest,
caught three passes, Rice two for a career-low two yards and Stokes
one for 11. Often, they trudged back to the huddle in the aftermath
of overthrown balls or drops that wouldn't have led to more than a
handful of yards anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Like their teammates, they were confused by the ineptitude of an
offensive system known for producing results regardless of
personnel or circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know what's going on,'' Owens said. ``I never
thought we would be 3-5 with everything unraveling like it is.
We're trying to make the best of our opportunities, but last year,
you knew you would have at least one chance a game to make a play.
Now you don't even know if you're going to touch the ball at all.''
</P>
<P>
   To a man, no wide receiver blames Garcia for this predicament.
They acknowledge it as a team dilemma, one that has resulted from
inconsistent pass protection, inexperience at quarterback and an
inability to run the ball on a weekly basis.
</P>
<P>
   But the offensive line has improved, the running game churned
for more than 200 yards last week and a new quarterback is under
center. Maybe all those factors will help the receivers. At this
point, they're praying something will.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to get our attitude back,'' Owens said. ``We have
to feel like we can beat the guys across from us, no matter what
position we're talking about. As receivers, we feel like we can
beat any defensive back. We all just have to get back on the same
page again.''

   LATINO-SCHOLAR (Amherst, MASS.) _ Ilan Stavchansky Slomianski
has come a long way from the Jewish enclave of Mexico City where he
grew up. There, Ilan, the son of a popular Mexican soap opera star
attended Yiddish day school and celebrated the high holidays in
synagogue. Other kids called him ``el guerito,'' little blondie.
Now he is known as Ilan Stavans (his father's stage name) _ a
widely-published writer and editor and one of the most influential
figures in the field of Latino literature in the United States.
W.W. Norton, the foremost publisher of literary canons, chose him
to produce a major anthology on Latino writing two years ago. To
some Latino experts, Stavans is a welcome presence who is creating
excitement about a long-overlooked field of writing. To others,
however, he is an ambitious interloper who is stealing attention
from more deserving, seasoned scholars. By Lynda Richardson. (1800

   LATINO-SCHOLAR (Amherst, MASS.) _ Ilan Stavchansky Slomianski
has come a long way from the Jewish enclave of Mexico City where he
grew up. There, Ilan, the son of a popular Mexican soap opera star
attended Yiddish day school and celebrated the high holidays in
synagogue. Other kids called him ``el guerito,'' little blondie.
Now he is known as Ilan Stavans (his father's stage name) _ a
widely-published writer and editor and one of the most influential
figures in the field of Latino literature in the United States.
W.W. Norton, the foremost publisher of literary canons, chose him
to produce a major anthology on Latino writing two years ago. To
some Latino experts, Stavans is a welcome presence who is creating
excitement about a long-overlooked field of writing. To others,
however, he is an ambitious interloper who is stealing attention
from more deserving, seasoned scholars. By Lynda Richardson. (1800

WASHINGTON GROPES FOR LAWS TO CONTROL THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w, a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It's not a store, but it moves merchandise. It's
not a TV network, but it broadcasts to millions of people. It's not
a magazine, but it publishes plenty of material _ some of it
libelous, and plenty of it pornographic.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has become a massive economic and social force
almost entirely without regulation from Congress or federal
agencies. But increasingly, Washington is being forced to decide if
the laws concerning books, broadcast, and brick-and-mortar stores
are adequate to reckon with the wired world.
</P>
<P>
   In just the past week, the House passed a bill to give
electronic signatures the same validity as the handwritten version.
And the leader of a congressional commission called for banning all
sales taxes on purchases made over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Federal Trade Commission held a public
discussion on limits to ``on-line profiling,'' the practice of
tracking people as they click across the Web in order to advertise
products based on their habits. And last Friday, a federal judge
issued a stinging assessment of Microsoft Corp.'s business
practices that lays the groundwork for broad antitrust penalties.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, the ultimate law or outcome is undecided, with
many people arguing that the old-world concepts of taxation,
antitrust, and other types of regulation have little place in
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our antitrust laws were enacted at a time of slow-moving
trains, not high-speed computers,'' said Senator Pete Domenici,
Republican of New Mexico, after the Microsoft ruling. ``I wonder
whether Congress should reconsider our antiquated antitrust laws
and look for a way to make them more responsive to today's global
high-technology economy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take much candlepower to see that this isn't going
to be an easy thing to do,'' Jerry Berman, executive director of
the Center for Democracy and Technology, said of Internet
regulation. ``The Internet is changing rapidly, and new (computer)
operating systems could be developed tomorrow, and gambling is
moving offshore,'' possibly beyond the reach of US laws. ``The idea
that everything can be worked out using traditional law is proving
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   At least 79 bills were filed in Congress this year to regulate
access to the Internet and the material that travels across it,
according to a tally by Congressional Quarterly, which covers
Capitol Hill. Moreover, a range of federal departments, from health
agencies to stock-market regulators, are grappling with what the
move on line means for their area of the law.
</P>
<P>
   But on some of the largest issues, lawmakers are asking for a
pause before they act. They want time to better understand the new
world of networked computers, and time for industries to try their
hand at self-regulation. Moreover, speedy action resulted in the
Supreme Court rejecting one of their first efforts, a law aimed at
regulating on-line pornography and other material deemed harmful to
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first mantra of the Internet is that before the government
regulates, go slow, that this is a new medium, a young medium, and
it's feeling its way,'' Berman said.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Edward Markey, Democrat of Malden, said that
there are many established legal principles that should be extended
quickly to the Internet. For example, he said, Congress has barred
companies from tracking which cable television shows a person
watches and selling the data to marketers. Phone calling patterns
and video rental records are also private.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only question is whether this new commercial phenomenon
(of on-line shopping) should be held to the same standards as other
commerce,'' Markey said. Privacy and consumer protection laws
should protect people on line as much as in other activities, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The most active issues include:
</P>
<P>
   --Sales taxes. While on-line retail sales could grow to $80
billion next year, up from $9 billion in 1998, Congress last year
imposed a three-year moratorium on Internet taxes and appointed a
study commission.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, which will report in April, must balance the
argument that taxes might choke Internet growth with the budgetary
needs of cities and states, which depend on sales tax revenues.
This week, the panel's chief proposed banning Internet sales taxes
and using federal money to cover the revenue that cities and states
would lose.
</P>
<P>
   --Stock trading. With on-line stock accounts expected to
quadruple in four years, to 20 million, regulators are just
beginning to grapple with how consumer-protection laws should apply
on line, where a rumor in a chat room can move stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, has warned that the established stock markets must use
the rise of on-line trading to give small traders the highest price
when they sell stock and the lowest price when they buy. Currently,
some critics say that individual investors do not get the best
prices because brokerage firms fill orders for large customers
first.
</P>
<P>
   --Privacy. While the number of households on line will jump to
43 percent this year, up from 6 percent in 1994, Congress has yet
to address many aspects of on-line privacy. At the lawmakers'
direction, the Federal Trade Commission last month issued rules to
protect the privacy of children but little has been done about
adult Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, lawmakers failed to meet their own deadline for
passing laws on medical records privacy, an issue made more
pressing because records are often stored electronically and
accessed over computer networks. Independently of Congress, the
Department of Health and Human Services recently issued a set of
privacy protections for electronic health records.
</P>
<P>
   --Gambling. The Justice Department has prosecuted several
on-line gambling operators and won several guilty pleas, using a
nearly 40-year-old law that bans wagers on phone lines or other
wires without state approval. But it is unclear whether these laws
apply to the Internet, and Congress has not yet spoken.
</P>
<P>
   --Antitrust. As soon as the Justice Department filed charges
against Microsoft, alleging that it used its Windows monopoly to
hurt competitors and consumers, critics said that the software
world moves too fast for antitrust regulation to be effective. What
looks like a monopoly today could be gone with a quick technology
shift tomorrow, they said.
</P>
<P>
   That is not the way Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson saw it. In his
200-page preliminary findings of fact last week, which agreed with
many of the government's claims, the federal district judge devoted
about 30 pages to discussing the durability of Microsoft's market
power.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson acknowledged that plenty of new computing products are
on the horizon, such as hand-held computers, ``smart'' cell phones,
and TV set-top boxes, which will make televisions more like
computers. He wrote that people may soon use these devices instead
of Microsoft software to send e-mail and browse the Web. He noted
the rise of Linux, a rival operating system to Microsoft's Windows.
</P>
<P>
   But none of that dampens the fact that Microsoft holds a
monopoly today, the judge wrote, and that its market power will
continue in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Others have disagreed, saying that the computer world moves too
quickly for prosecutors to respond. Their most signficant evidence:
After the trial began last year, one company that the government
says was injured by Microsoft's business practices _ Netscape
Communications Corp. _ was acquired by America Online, giving it
new resources for a fight with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this case ever makes it to the Supreme Court, Microsoft and
the Justice Department will be arguing about events in a
long-forgotten world,'' wrote David S. Evans of National Economic
Research Associates Inc. in Cambridge, Mass. in September.

monopoly today, the judge wrote, and that its market power will
continue in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Others have disagreed, saying that the computer world moves too
quickly for prosecutors to respond. Their most signficant evidence:
After the trial began last year, one company that the government
says was injured by Microsoft's business practices _ Netscape
Communications Corp. _ was acquired by America Online, giving it
new resources for a fight with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this case ever makes it to the Supreme Court, Microsoft and
the Justice Department will be arguing about events in a
long-forgotten world,'' wrote David S. Evans of National Economic
Research Associates Inc. in Cambridge, Mass. in September.

SOME SENSE ON EXECUTIONS FROM COURTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard to believe, but it's true: The American justice system
produced two sensible rulings this week on issues involving capital
punishment. The rulings came down on the same day, in fact, and
both paved the way for condemned killers to finally face their fate
after years of successfully dodging the executioner.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the cases, a state district judge ruled that Texas
Death Row inmate Larry Keith Robison is sufficiently competent to
receive the lethal injection that should have been administered
nearly three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Robison was scheduled to be executed Aug. 17, but his trip to
the death chamber was delayed by the Texas Court of Criminal
Appeals after his lawyer claimed that Robison wasn't capable of
understanding the punishment. Judge Everett Young rejected the
claim Monday at a hearing in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Robison was convicted and sentenced to death for one of five
murders he committed near Lake Worth in August 1982 _ then
convicted and sentenced to death again after the original
conviction was thrown out on a technicality. His victims' loved
ones and the taxpayers of Texas wait patiently for Robison to
undergo the punishment he so richly deserves.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court, meanwhile, ventured into the realm of
common sense by rejecting the appeals of two condemned killers who
claimed that their lengthy stays on Death Row _ one for 19 years in
Nebraska, the other for 24 years in Florida _ added up to cruel and
unusual punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Can you believe it? Convicted killers and their lawyers employ
every trick in the law books to delay executions _ two-decade stays
on Death Row are commonplace _ and now we have the instigators of
the delays claiming that the delays are unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the Supreme Court saw through this preposterous and
ironic argument.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what Justice Clarence Thomas said, as quoted by The
Associated Press:
</P>
<P>
   ``Consistency would seem to demand that those who accept our
death penalty jurisprudence as a given also accept the lengthy
delay between sentencing and execution as a necessary
consequence.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if these vile excuses for human beings who
populate the nation's Death Rows want to postpone the inevitable by
filing appeal after appeal after appeal, they should be prepared to
wait in prison limbo for however long it takes for the legal system
to work its magic.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine that a legal argument could be any more
disingenuous than a condemned killer's claim that it takes too long
to put him out of his misery when in fact the only reason it takes
so long is because the killer keeps putting it off with redundant
appeals. If these creeps are so eager to face their personal
doomsdays, why don't they just shut up and face them?
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to Larry Keith Robison, who testified the
other day that the delay of his execution was not his doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was ready to accept my execution in August,'' Robison said.
``I was ready to go peacefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Good for him. It's high time that the state of Texas put this
guy to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   So why are the do-gooders and bleeding hearts working so hard to
prevent the fate that Robison is so perfectly willing to accept?
</P>
<P>
   That's an easy one. It's what do-gooders and bleeding hearts do.
It's what they live for. You'd think that these nitwits could keep
themselves plenty busy just trying to save all the homicidal
maniacs who don't want to be executed without gumming up the works
trying to prevent the long-overdue death of a man who knows that
it's long overdue and just wants to get it over with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm willing to accept the ruling of the court on this
matter,'' Robison said.
</P>
<P>
   This is a man who understands exactly what he's saying and doing
_ just as he understood what he was doing back in 1982 when he
slaughtered five people whose surviving loved ones deserve, at long
last, to see justice done.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, delaying an execution for 20 years really
is cruel and unusual punishment _ not for the killer, but for
society.

SAN DIEGO LINEBACKER IS THE BEST. JUST ASK HIM

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALAMEDA, Calif. _ If the Oakland Raiders want to neutralize San
Diego Chargers linebacker Junior Seau, they may just want to hold a
full-length mirror in front of No. 55.
</P>
<P>
   Because nothing makes Junior Seau drop all he's doing like the
chance for Junior Seau to admire Junior Seau.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Seau's self-confidence is to be admired. While most NFL
players shy away from any topic other than the proverbial ``one
game at a time,'' Seau isn't afraid to talk about Seau. And Seau's
talent. And Seau's impact on the game. And Seau's future
enshrinement in the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a guy who, asked to describe his play, said he liked to
think he has the athletic ability of Lawrence Taylor, the
intelligence of Mike Singletary and the durability of Clay
Matthews. What, Dick Butkus slipped his mind? Here's a guy who, in
a telephone interview with sports writers this week, was asked if
he is at a point in his career where his body and mind have peaked
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say I am,'' Seau, 30, said. ``And it's a comfortable
feeling to go out on the field and know that, no matter what type
of personnel you put out there, I can take a glance at what you
give me and 85 percent of the time I know what you're going to do
and when you're going to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys think they know football, but they really
don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a guy who was asked about his tendencies to study film,
and managed to turn the answer into a boast of how every NFL team
fears him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't sit there every day of the week and wonder if my
opponents are thinking of me,'' Seau said. ``I know they are. And I
know they have my picture up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Seau was also asked if he thinks about his place among the
all-time greats. While nearly every NFL player gives the standard
answer of: ``Guys, that's for you to decide,`` or ``Guys, I worry
about this week's game plan,'' Seau instead tasted the topic like a
fine wine, enjoying every implication.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are bringing that up,'' Seau said. ``In order
to be special in this league, you've got to put years together.
I've been able to withstand a lot of injuries and be blessed with
the health that I have ... the only reason I haven't slowed down is
due to the knowledge of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   For a guy raised in American Samoa who didn't speak English
until the age of 7, the University of Southern California product
sure has mastered the use of the first-person in his second
language.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the catch: Seau backs it all up. All of it.
</P>
<P>
   Because yes, the Raiders acknowledge, they have spent all week
thinking of Seau and yes, the Raiders believe he is one of the
NFL's truly special players and yes, they buy all of it.
</P>
<P>
   Priority number one when the Raiders try to move the ball
against the NFL's No. 6-ranked defense on Sunday: They will have to
do it despite the play of San Diego's leading tackler, sacker and
eight-time Pro Bowler.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a Hall of Famer,'' Raiders coach Jon Gruden said. ``How
he keeps his energy level up is beyond me. I'd like to know what
he's eating, how much he's sleeping, what program he's on, because
I want to get on that. Since I've been in the league, he's probably
the one guy that I admire the most. He's amazing.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every young football player, they ought to make Football
101 and they ought to watch him play. If anything, he's gotten
quicker, stronger and more irritating for an opposing coach.''

LARRY KEITH ROBISON: JUSTICE DELAYED, BUT PERHAPS NOT DENIED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Slowly, one tortured legal step after another, the relatives of
Bruce Gardner are inching toward justice.
</P>
<P>
   A ruling this week by state district Judge Everett Young that
Larry Keith Robison is mentally competent to be executed for
killing the Fort Worth man in 1982 brings the final curtain of a
17-year tragedy one act closer.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, relatives of five victims are waiting for the end of
this passion play. Although Robison was only tried for the shooting
death of 33-year-old Gardner, he savagely killed Rickey Lee Bryant,
Gloria Ann Reed and her son, Scott, and Earline Barker the same
bloody August day.
</P>
<P>
   Robison was just hours away from lethal injection on Aug. 17
when the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals issued a temporary stay,
ordering a competency hearing to determine whether Robison
understood that he was to be put to death for his actions.
</P>
<P>
   Robison's mother, his attorneys and anti-death-penalty advocates
have long professed that mental illness should exempt Larry from
his jury-imposed sentence with the needle. Make that twice
jury-imposed sentence. Two different juries seated before two
different judges determined that Robison was sane when he committed
the crimes, sane when he was convicted and sane when he was
sentenced.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony this week by five mental health experts, including
three hired on Robison's behalf, along with Robison's own apologies
to the victims' families led Young to the right decision: Larry
Keith Robison clearly understands the consequence that awaits him.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the judge's ruling this week is not the end of the story.
Attorneys for Robison _ or more accurately, for his mother, who has
fought doggedly to keep her son's death penalty from being carried
out _ say they plan to appeal Young's competency ruling, saying
that more tests are needed and that Larry only said what he said
because he doesn't want the world to think he's mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   It's understandable that a mother would want to do everything
possible to save the life of her son, but another round of appeals
is nothing more than a stall tactic. Drag it out long enough, and
one could expect Robison's lawyers to attempt to argue that
delaying the execution is in itself cruel and unusual punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the U.S. Supreme Court shut down that avenue this
week when it refused to consider whether the execution of prisoners
nearly two decades after taking up residence on Death Row is
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Appeals from Florida and Nebraska Death Row inmates who claimed
that delayed executions _ one for 20 years, the other for almost 25
_ violated their Eighth Amendment rights were rejected. Justice
Clarence Thomas wrote one of the most common-sense concurrences to
ever come out of the high court: ``I am unaware of any support in
the American constitutional tradition or in this court's precedent
that a defendant can avail himself of the panoply of (Rappeals) and
then complain when his execution is delayed.''
</P>
<P>
   Death-penalty opponents have been working overtime on Robison's
case, citing how ``barbaric and capricious'' the act of capital
punishment is. In truth, the death penalty is the least arbitrary
and capricious punishment meted out in the American criminal
justice system.
</P>
<P>
   The law is relentless to the point of obsessiveness in finding
grounds to set aside a death sentence. If it weren't, this country
wouldn't have killers sitting on Death Row decade after decade.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 25 years, less than 500 Death Row felons have seen
their sentences carried out. More than 2,000 have had their
sentences vacated. A Death Row prisoner is more likely to have the
sentence overturned, commuted, a new trial ordered or a pardon
granted than he is to be executed.
</P>
<P>
   So don't talk to the families of Bruce Gardner, Rickey Lee
Bryant, Earline Barker, and Gloria Ann and Scott Reed about how
``capricious'' capital punishment is in this country.
``Capricious'' may be used to describe whatever evil and
inexplicable urge drove Larry Keith Robison to slaughter five
people on Aug. 10, 1982 _ but please don't insult the memories of
the victims by using it to describe justice, no matter how long it
might be delayed.

   BODY-MIND-WORKOUTS (New York) _ Though Tae-Bo's 15 minutes of
martial-arts workout seem to be up, it has produced spinoffs that
fuse American fitness with ethnic cultural traditions, promising
not only to strengthen the body but also to integrate it with the
mind. Now the art of capoiera from Brazil and krav maga from Israel
claim to achieve this connection. By Alex Witchel. Photo.

   BIRTHDAY-BASHES (New York) _ Writers about raising children may
preach modesty in birthday parties or advise inviting one guest for
each year celebrated; but all over New York, parents are ignoring
them. ``We have never been busier,'' said Chuck Santoro, aka
Professor Winkle, who with his partner, Liz Nagengast, aka Ms.
Teazlebee, runs In Tandem Productions, which puts on elaborate
children's parties. Besides playing host to FAO Schwarz parties,
they offer Madeline brunches for girls and Batman brunches for boys
at the Four Seasons Hotel for about $4,000. The American Museum of
Natural History lets members have birthday parties among its
exhibits for $1,500 and up. ``People are spending more money than
they ever have for kids that are younger and younger,'' said
Katherine Wyse Goldman, author of ``New York's 50 Best Places to
Have a Kids Party'' (City &AMP; Company, $12). By Monique P. Yazigi.

   BUTLER-BOOK (Undated) _ According to a new book by Paul Burrell,
``In the Royal Manner: Expert Advice on Etiquette and Entertaining
From the Former Butler to Diana, Princess of Wales'' (Warner, $28),
is that, let me quote here, ``style is not the exclusive preserve
of the rich and the famous.'' ``Style,'' the book says, ``can be
achieved by anyone.'' Burrell, a cheery fellow of 41, looks a lot
like Tom Hanks but who, unlike Tom, is presently without a
full-time job. By Joyce Wadler. Photo.

   NITEOUT-DOGMA (New York) _ This is about as exciting as my life
gets on a Saturday night, going to Mass,'' said Kevin Smith, who
wrote, directed and acted in the new film ``Dogma.'' Going to Mass
has lately become exciting for Smith, thanks to the prospect of
confrontation arising from ``Dogma.'' The Catholic League picketed
its premiere at the New York Film Festival in October, citing the
film's implication that Mary and Joseph had sex and a second child,
that one of Jesus's collateral descendants works in an abortion
clinic and so on. By Linda Lee. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   SKIN-DOCTORS (Undated) _ Welcome to the age of the new
dermatology, the once humble medical specialty that is elbowing
aside plastic surgery as a glamour profession. Gone are the days
when acne sufferers shamefully scurried to a skin doctor to have
pimples popped in drab green examining rooms. Today's skin doctors,
repackaged as beauty gurus, are marketing their own cosmetics,
promising to reverse the effects of aging and _ the latest trend _
opening their own day spas, complete with facials, seaweed wraps
and a nice soak in a Jacuzzi. By Elizabeth Hayt. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ Despite all the gloomy predictions
that the summer's drought would drain the woods of color this fall,
I've seen some pretty fiery sweet gums, maples and scarlet oaks.
But I also watched the leaves of birches and dogwoods, both
shallow-rooted trees, droop and turn brown by mid-July. Some trees,
especially those on dry hills, simply toppled over. By Anne Raver.

   Actually, relatives of five victims are waiting for the end of
this passion play. Although Robison was only tried for the shooting
death of 33-year-old Gardner, he savagely killed Rickey Lee Bryant,
Gloria Ann Reed and her son, Scott, and Earline Barker the same
bloody August day.
</P>
<P>
   Robison was just hours away from lethal injection on Aug. 17
when the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals issued a temporary stay,
ordering a competency hearing to determine whether Robison
understood that he was to be put to death for his actions.
</P>
<P>
   Robison's mother, his attorneys and anti-death-penalty advocates
have long professed that mental illness should exempt Larry from
his jury-imposed sentence with the needle. Make that twice
jury-imposed sentence. Two different juries seated before two
different judges determined that Robison was sane when he committed
the crimes, sane when he was convicted and sane when he was
sentenced.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony this week by five mental health experts, including
three hired on Robison's behalf, along with Robison's own apologies
to the victims' families led Young to the right decision: Larry
Keith Robison clearly understands the consequence that awaits him.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the judge's ruling this week is not the end of the story.
Attorneys for Robison _ or more accurately, for his mother, who has
fought doggedly to keep her son's death penalty from being carried
out _ say they plan to appeal Young's competency ruling, saying
that more tests are needed and that Larry only said what he said
because he doesn't want the world to think he's mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   It's understandable that a mother would want to do everything
possible to save the life of her son, but another round of appeals
is nothing more than a stall tactic. Drag it out long enough, and
one could expect Robison's lawyers to attempt to argue that
delaying the execution is in itself cruel and unusual punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the U.S. Supreme Court shut down that avenue this
week when it refused to consider whether the execution of prisoners
nearly two decades after taking up residence on Death Row is
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Appeals from Florida and Nebraska Death Row inmates who claimed
that delayed executions _ one for 20 years, the other for almost 25
_ violated their Eighth Amendment rights were rejected. Justice
Clarence Thomas wrote one of the most common-sense concurrences to
ever come out of the high court: ``I am unaware of any support in
the American constitutional tradition or in this court's precedent
that a defendant can avail himself of the panoply of (Rappeals) and
then complain when his execution is delayed.''
</P>
<P>
   Death-penalty opponents have been working overtime on Robison's
case, citing how ``barbaric and capricious'' the act of capital
punishment is. In truth, the death penalty is the least arbitrary
and capricious punishment meted out in the American criminal
justice system.
</P>
<P>
   The law is relentless to the point of obsessiveness in finding
grounds to set aside a death sentence. If it weren't, this country
wouldn't have killers sitting on Death Row decade after decade.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 25 years, less than 500 Death Row felons have seen
their sentences carried out. More than 2,000 have had their
sentences vacated. A Death Row prisoner is more likely to have the
sentence overturned, commuted, a new trial ordered or a pardon
granted than he is to be executed.
</P>
<P>
   So don't talk to the families of Bruce Gardner, Rickey Lee
Bryant, Earline Barker, and Gloria Ann and Scott Reed about how
``capricious'' capital punishment is in this country.
``Capricious'' may be used to describe whatever evil and
inexplicable urge drove Larry Keith Robison to slaughter five
people on Aug. 10, 1982 _ but please don't insult the memories of
the victims by using it to describe justice, no matter how long it
might be delayed.

TOYOTA ROLLS OUT STUNNING NEW CELICA FOR 2000
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The seventh-generation Toyota Celica sport hatchback began
rolling into dealer showrooms last month as a 2000 model,
completely redesigned from the roof to the road.
</P>
<P>
   This subcompact sports-car wannabe is designed for people who
like the looks of a sporty vehicle, but can't afford a real sports
car. The new design, a product of Toyota's California studio, is
worthy of a vehicle a lot more expensive than the Celica's
mid-teens to low $20,000 base prices.
</P>
<P>
   Two models are offered: the base GT, which lists for $16,695,
and the uplevel GT-S, which we tested. The GT-S, which lists for
$21,165 before extras are tacked on, gets a bit more power than the
GT model.
</P>
<P>
   Both vehicles carry the same basic 1.8-liter four-cylinder
engine, but a special variable valve timing and lift system in the
GT-S engine gives it 180 horsepower, 40 more than that of the GT.
</P>
<P>
   That extra power takes some effort to get to, however, since the
GT-S engine doesn't reach peak performance until 7,600 rpm _ just
200 rpm under redline. The 133 foot-pounds of torque don't develop
fully until 6,800 rpm, so this vehicle is a bit slow getting
started.
</P>
<P>
   But don't forget: it's not really a sports car. If it were, it
would have at least a six-cylinder engine, and it would cost a lot
more. It would have rear-wheel drive, too; instead, it has
front-wheel drive, which takes a good bit away from what its
roadhandling characteristics could be.
</P>
<P>
   Just like a Ford Mustang with a four- or six-cylinder engine,
the Celica is meant more for show than go, which matches its
projected buyer demographics. The car is aimed primarily at young
women, most of whom probably won't care that there isn't a lot of
macho power under the hood.
</P>
<P>
   Climbing into the Celica, my head touched the ceiling and I'm
just barely 5-foot-10.
</P>
<P>
   To make it more comfortable for me, I would have to forgo the
optional $880 moon roof, which takes up about two inches of head
room. Forget putting anyone larger than a small child in the back
seat; it's there mostly for insurance purposes (to keep the car out
of the higher-cost sports-car class). The rear seat does fold down
to increase cargo area, however.
</P>
<P>
   The exterior is absolutely beautiful, with a cab-forward design
that Toyota describes as ``a high-fashion look with Indy-car
elements.'' The projector-beam halogen headlights are decidedly
high-tech and futuristic, and the sharp-edged side panels and hood
air scoop add considerable excitement to the overall look.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently gone, at least for now, is the convertible version of
the Celica. No mention is made of it in Toyota product literature
for 2000. The Celica comes only in the hatchback body style,
although it really doesn't look like a hatchback _ it looks like a
coupe.
</P>
<P>
   GT models come with a five-speed manual transmission or an
optional four-speed automatic. With the GT-S, a six-speed manual
gearbox is standard, and this is the best choice to wring the most
power out of the engine. A four-speed automatic with
steering-wheel-mounted sport-shift buttons is optional. This
arrangement, like that found on a Formula One race car, allows for
clutchless manual shifting of gears to improve performance.
</P>
<P>
   The Celica has MacPherson struts up front and a double-wishbone
suspension in the rear, which work together to hold the car to the
road fairly well. Again, it's no sports car, but it does hug the
road in tight curves much better than the average family sedan.
</P>
<P>
   The brakes on the GT-S have great stopping power, thanks to
11.5-inch ventilated front discs and solid, 10-inch rear disks. The
GT model has 10-inch ventilated front discs and eight-inch rear
drum brakes, which aren't quite as effective. Antilock brakes are
optional, and were not included on our test car. That is a safety
feature that should be standard.
</P>
<P>
   Front air bags are standard, but Toyota offers side air bags
($250) for the driver and front passenger as an option.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen-inch steel wheels are standard on the GT, while 15-inch
alloy wheels are standard on the GT-S. Ours came with optional
16-inch alloy wheels ($60).
</P>
<P>
   Standard equipment on GT models includes air-conditioning, a
six-speaker AM/FM/cassette/compact-disc in-dash stereo, power
steering and power mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   With the GT-S, Toyota adds power windows and door locks, cruise
control, fog lights, aluminum sport pedals, and a premium
AM/FM/cassette/CD system with eight speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Factory options on our test vehicle included the moon roof,
16-inch wheels, side air bags, leather-faced front seats ($620),
and rear deck-lid spoiler ($435).
</P>
<P>
   Distributor-installed options included a vehicle exterior
``protection package'' for $199 (what, Toyota doesn't protect the
finish at the factory?), and the ``extra-mile option package''
($775), which added permanent etching of the vehicle identification
number on the windows, custom pin striping, a cargo net, floor
mats, and a rearview mirror with built-in digital compass and
outside thermometer.
</P>
<P>
   Total price of our test car was $24,669, including $455
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy ratings for the 180-horsepower engine with
six-speed manual transmission are 23 miles per gallon in the city
and 32 mpg on the highway. The tank holds 14.5 gallons of gasoline,
and unleaded super is recommended for the GT-S. The GT model runs
on regular unleaded and gets up to 28 mpg in the city and 34 mpg on
the highway.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   AT A GLANCE: 2000 TOYOTA CELICA GT-S SPORT HATCHBACK &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE PACKAGE: Subcompact, two-door, four-cylinder,
sport-hatchback. Highlights: With an all-new California-born design
for 2000, the Celica looks a lot more expensive than it is. It
comes in two trim levels, GT and GT-S, with a 180-horsepower
1.8-liter engine in the GT-S model. The car handles well, and shows
great attention to detail _ a Toyota trademark.
</P>
<P>
   NEGATIVES: Could use more power via a six-cylinder engine; head
room is limited, cramping even marginally tall people.
</P>
<P>
   MAJOR COMPETITORS: Ford Mustang, Chevrolet Camaro, Honda
Prelude, Mitsubishi Eclipse, Pontiac Firebird.
</P>
<P>
   EPA FUEL ECONOMY: 23 miles per gallon city/32 highway.
</P>
<P>
   BASE PRICE: $21,165 plus $485 transportation.
</P>
<P>
   PRICE AS TESTED: $24,669, including transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE ROAD RATING: B.

 &HT;    HIGH TECH INDUSTRY TO WORLD TRADE BODY: HANDS OFF E-COMMERCE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. high-tech industry Friday called on
foreign governments to keep their hands off the booming
international digital
</P>
<P>
   marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   With the full White House backing, industry leaders will press
for unimpeded e-commerce trade rules at the coming World Trade
Organization (WTO) meeting. Two key groups have joined in drafting
a position paper that says:
</P>
<P>
   ``The WTO ministers should make a commitment to keep electronic
commerce barrier-free. Such a commitment would set the tone and
direction for ongoing liberalization, (and) foster a transparent,
predictable and technology neutral environment that will help spur
global economic growth throughout the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement was released by Robert Holleyman, president and
chief executive officer of the Business Software Alliance, which
represents such leading software developers as Microsoft Corp., and
Rhett Dawson, president of Information Technology Industry Council,
the trade association of information technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   At a briefing for reporters, Holleyman noted that 54 percent of
software revenues of domestic firms are currently being generated
beyond U.S. borders. ``The benefits of liberalized e-commerce trade
are enormous,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts predict that by 2003, the amount of e-commerce
conducted over the Internet will top $1 trillion, while the number
of Internet users worldwide will rise from 196 million to 500
million, with the biggest percentage jump occurring outside the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a recent survey of 50 big U.S. online retailers,
conducted by Jupiter Communications, found that 28 percent of these
companies have mounted Internet pages targeted at foreign buyers.
</P>
<P>
   The e-commerce issue will rank high on the agenda when the 134
members of the World Trade Organization gather Nov. 30 to Dec. 3 in
Seattle. Both the Clinton administration and the Republican-led
Congress have signaled their strong support for continuing on an
indefinite basis the duty-free e-commerce policy begun last year.
</P>
<P>
   WTO members have already reached a preliminary accord not to
levy import duties on e-commerce until at least 2001. But a major
battle looms in Seattle between the United States and the 15-member
European Union and over how to classify the burgeoning business for
trade purposes
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans will argue that every item traded over the
Internet should be treated as a service. Washington, however, wants
e-commerce to remain more nebulous, to be treated as ``virtual
goods'' or left unclassified.
</P>
<P>
   The distinction is vital because if such downloaded items as
music, videos and books are viewed as services, then current trade
rules provide for much more restricted market access than the kind
of across-the-board access enjoyed by most goods.
</P>
<P>
   India and several other third-world nations are also expected to
balk when the ministers seek to fit e-commerce into the tangle of
laws that discipline world trade.
</P>
<P>
   Indian officials appear ready to use e-commerce liberalization
as a bargaining chip to gain concessions in other trade areas, such
as agriculture. A U.S. trade delegation has been sent to New Delhi
in a bid to convince that government_ which heavily subsidizes the
training of computer programmers _ that it is in India's
self-interest not to block world e-commerce expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't need a whole new set of rules for e-commerce,''
Susan Esserman, the deputy U.S. trade representative, told Congress
last month. ``The existing regulations can apply.''

 &HT;    SOLDIERS SEARCH FOR WRECKAGE OF MISSING FOOD PLANE IN KOSOVO; 24
POSSIBLY DEAD
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Soldiers from the international
peacekeeping force in Kosovo searched the hills near the Serbian
border Friday night for a humanitarian aid airplane that vanished
from radar earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   There were conflicting reports late Friday as to whether the 21
passengers and three crew members on the World Food Program (WFP)
chartered flight were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was on approach to the militarily controlled airport
here in Pristina when it disappeared, said Bernard Kouchner, the
head of the United Nations Mission in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Aboard the aircraft included staff from the WFP, the U.N.
Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), U.N. volunteers, non-governmental
organizations and a Canadian official. Their names were not
released.
</P>
<P>
   While officials in Kosovo said they could not confirm that the
plane had crashed, a WFP executive in Rome told reporters that the
aircraft had gone down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just learned that the flight has unfortunately crashed,''
said Catherine Bertini, the Rome-based agency's executive director
told the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Reuters reported that an unidentified U.N. official said search
teams had found the wreckage near a village 25 miles north of
Pristina, Kosovo's provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials in Pristina denied that any wreckage had been
found by early evening.
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner said there was no immediate way to know what happened.
The U.N. assumed administrative control over Kosovo in June after
Serbian-led Yugoslav forces were forced to leave following a 78-day
bombing campaign by NATO. The international community intervened to
stop the Serbs from ethnically cleansing the province of its
Albanian majority.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot of the twin-engine turbo-prop passenger plane had been
in radio contact with controllers in Pristina minutes before the
aircraft disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was on a routine flight between Rome and Pristina for
WFP, a U.N.-affiliated organization. It disappeared from radar at
about 11:20 a.m. local time. The French-made ATR 42 chartered from
the Balmoral Co. in South Africa, left Rome's Ciampino Airport at
9:05 a.m. (3:05 a.m. EST), the WFP said.
</P>
<P>
   The military force in Kosovo, known as KFOR, immediately
deployed helicopters to search the hills north of Pristina where
radar last indicated the aircraft's location, said Kouchner during
a briefing with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Squads of troops also were deployed in the area, which has been
identified as containing minefields, said U.S. Brigadier Gen. Jack
Schmitt, the head of KFOR ground operations.
</P>
<P>
   The ground search was called off at sunset, Schmitt said. ``It's
a mountainous area, very rugged with numerous known minefields so
it is very, very dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   After nightfall, as family members gathered outside the U.N.
headquarters here in Pristina awaiting news, KFOR continued
searching for the aircraft with helicopters equipped with special
night vision and thermal detection equipment.

`MARY, MOTHER OF JESUS': IT DOES BETTER WHEN IT STICKS TO
SCRIPTURE

<TEXT>
<P>
   At the end of the NBC film ``Mary, Mother of Jesus,'' Pernilla
August as the title character is asked by her son's disciples what
they should do now that Jesus is gone. That's simple, she says,
with an attempt at a beatific smile, they should ``try to teach as
he taught, live as he lived and love as he loved.''
</P>
<P>
   Any script that sums up the meaning of the life of Jesus (which
is what this does, despite the title) with greeting card sentiment
is in deep trouble. And this one, by Albert Ross and directed by
Kevin Connor, whose previous work includes television movies on
Mother Teresa and Diana, Princess of Wales, is sadly simple-minded.
When John the Baptist's headless corpse is thrown to the crowd
waiting for him _ this is the New Testament influenced by Tarantino
_ someone cries out, ``They've murdered him!'' You think?
</P>
<P>
   Connor does better when he sticks to Scripture. For instance,
when the aforementioned John, while baptizing new converts in the
River Jordan, looks up and sees Jesus in the flesh for the first
time, he announces convincingly, ``Behold the Lamb of God, who
takes away the sins of the world.'' But there isn't nearly enough
of that in this very disappointing two-hour movie, a project of
Bobby Shriver and his mother, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, who served as
executive producers.
</P>
<P>
   The only real reason to watch ``Mary, Mother of Jesus'' is to
see Christian Bale play Jesus as a confident, purposeful, sexy
young revolutionary. After all the soft-spoken, sad-eyed Jesuses in
movies past, Bale's interpretation is, pardon the choice of words,
a revelation. When he gently but firmly tells Mary that he has to
go on the road and leave her behind, and later _ shortly before the
Last Supper _ when he tells her, ``Now it's nearly over,'' he could
be Bobby Sands, the Irish Republican Army martyr, explaining to his
mother why he has to go on a hunger strike. Or just about any young
man with intense political convictions that go against the
Establishment of the time. Bale has said that Che Guevara was one
of his inspirations for the role.
</P>
<P>
   Bale was born with a mixed blessing, at least for actors:
striking good looks. This is often mentioned in reviews of his
films, which include ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' (Demetrius),
``Velvet Goldmine'' (the journalist) and even ``Empire of the Sun''
(the boy), Steven Spielberg's 1987 film, when Bale was 14. In
``Mary, Mother of Jesus,'' this adds a welcome credibility to
Jesus' remarkable popularity during the three short years he
preached.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with biblical movies is that scholars don't know a
lot about the main characters beyond what the Bible tells us.
Sometimes screenwriters decide to invent personal lives for the
historical figures, and that leads to lines like Nina Foch's to
Charlton Heston in ``The Ten Commandments'': ``Moses, you beautiful
fool!'' At other times screenwriters stick to the biblical facts,
which don't do much emotional delving, and end up with scenes that
look like dramatized re-creations on ``America's Most Wanted.''
This happens a lot in ``Mary, Mother of Jesus,'' from the
water-into-wine miracle at the wedding in Cana to Jesus' entering
Jerusalem on a donkey while believers wave palm fronds.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. August as Mary is lost in all this re-created detail. Even
she has compared this role to the one she played in ``Star Wars:
Episode One _ The Phantom Menace'': the mother of Anakin Skywalker,
who will grow up to be Darth Vader. In ``Star Wars'' mythology,
that is as close as you can get to having given birth to the Devil.
Anakin's birth, too, was a matter of immaculate conception. But in
the ``Star Wars'' role Ms. August, who is best known for working in
Ingmar Bergman films, exhibits a complicated, noble maternal love,
a fierce resignation to her son's inevitable departure and to his
future, which cannot include her. As Mary, Ms. August seems to be
straining to convey some of that intensity _ or at least an
emotional radiance _ but neither ever surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   It would be interesting, from a feminist perspective, to see the
story of Mary's entire life, before the Annunciation and after the
Resurrection. This film is about the 33 years of her son's life,
with cruel Roman soldiers, stonings and unconvincingly unruly mobs
thrown in for action fans.

FILIPINOS STRUGGLE TO GET U.S. VETERANS BENEFITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRIAN MURPHY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As a Filipino in the U.S. Army during World War
II, Pfc. Gary Aranal endured the Bataan death march after his unit
surrendered to Japanese forces in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   More than 55 years later, Aranal is involved in a different
battle. He is fighting to get the same veterans benefits that other
American soldiers receive.
</P>
<P>
   Aranal, commander of the Veterans Federation of Filipino
Americans in Daly City, said the United States has ``forgotten
about its own citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Aranal, 73, was one of 400 Filipino war veterans who turned out
Thursday at the grand opening of the Veterans Equity Center, a
small advocacy and assistance office in San Francisco. The opening,
timed with Veterans Day, was used by many of the veterans to plead
for more help as time runs out on the aging generation's cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``America hasn't come to our aid,'' said Federico Rivas, 80, a
retired lieutenant who lives in San Francisco. ``We want to get the
benefits promised to us by General (Douglas) MacArthur,'' who
commanded American and Philippine forces in the Philippines at the
time of the surrender of the islands in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   The situation creates a special tension for the veterans, who
remain loyal to the United States despite their struggles.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the veterans saluted the U.S. flag in commemoration of
Veterans Day while some acted out a short skit chronicling the
Japanese invasion of the Philippines and MacArthur's eventual
victory in what was then an American commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
   But the events and speeches belied a sense of betrayal felt by
many of the veterans, who equate their compensation with
recognition of their service in the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still profess loyalty to the U.S. in spite of all that's
happened against us,'' Aranal said. ``We really feel bad about this
but there's nothing we can do except keep fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, about 200,000 Filipinos fought alongside
American troops under MacArthur, who had recaptured the islands by
July 1945. Though U.S. leaders promised the veterans they would
receive U.S. citizenship and veterans benefits after the war,
Congress withdrew that offer in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   It would be 44 years before President George Bush signed a
citizenship bill, allowing the veterans to emigrate to the United
States. The law, however, did not address benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands took advantage of the offer in hopes they could
eventually win their veterans benefits while bringing their
families to the States. But after almost a decade, many are now
stranded here, receiving meager Social Security checks that won't
pay the cost of bringing their wives and other family here. And
most won't return to the Philippines because they will lose their
Social Security benefits.
</P>
<P>
   It has become a lonely and frustrating existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad to be here, separated from our families,'' said Mario
Enrique-Lim, 87, a retired major in the medical corps. ``We're used
to having close-knit families in the Philippines.''
</P>
<P>
   Founders of the Veterans Equity Center hope they can ease the
situation for the veterans. The center offers health, legal and
immigration advice to veterans who may not know where to go to
receive it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the veterans feel secluded and isolated and are
hesitant to avail themselves to the resources out there for them,''
said Lourdes Tancinco, a San Francisco lawyer and president of the
center's board of directors. ``Because of the language and cultural
problems, they fear they won't be understood.''
</P>
<P>
   While the center provides limited help for the veterans, the
real aid would come with the long-awaited military benefits. The
benefits would include monthly payments of up to $700 for veterans
and medical attention at any Department of Veterans Affairs
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   After four consecutive tries in Congress, a benefits bill was
not introduced in the most recent session. Filipino leaders are
first trying to get a pending humanitarian bill passed that will
allow the veterans to return to the Philippines while still
receiving 75 percent of their Social Security benefits, said Abe
Angeles, secretary general of the Sons and Daughters of Filipino
War Veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Angeles said perhaps as many as 500 veterans in San Francisco
would return to the Philippines if the humanitarian bill passes.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's not the ultimate goal, it would provide many
veterans the means to return home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better dying in their motherland than dying here alone,''
Angeles said.
</P>
<P>
   Time is running short for the veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much time left and we're dying every day,'' Aranal
said. ``That's why this is so disgusting.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When someone has been Mr. America, it's tough to
ignore him when he talks physiques. Rich Barretta, a personal
trainer who charges $150 an hour to inspire Manhattan's
office-bound bodies, recently opened Duomo at 11 E. 26th St.
``Stepping is pretty much dead,'' he proclaimed, touting instead
the latest trend in workouts: aerobic versions of battle, namely
capoiera (pronounced ca-PWHERE-ah), which is Brazilian martial
arts, and krav maga (pronounced krav ma-GAH), which is Israeli
hand-to-hand combat.
</P>
<P>
   Who said New Yorkers are getting nicer?
</P>
<P>
   ``People are always looking for something new and different,''
Barretta said. ``I thought we should go find art forms from around
the world that have been getting people in shape for hundreds of
years.'' These also include belly dancing and kick boxing. ``I want
martial-arts instructors, not Tae-Bo instructors,'' he said,
referring to last year's rage, which combined boxing, aerobics and
tae kwon do.
</P>
<P>
   Though Tae-Bo's 15 minutes seem to be up, it has produced these
spinoffs that fuse American fitness with ethnic cultural
traditions, promising not only to strengthen the body but also to
integrate it with the mind. Both capoiera and krav maga claim to
achieve this connection, but Barretta prefers that his instructors
teach aerobicized versions of the original disciplines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional capoiera class is too dangerous,'' he said.
``And it takes a long time to get good.''
</P>
<P>
   Nanette Pattee Francini, a founder of the Sports Club company,
which owns the Reebok Sports Club/New York and two branches of the
Sports Club/L.A., scheduled to open in New York next year, said:
``The future direction of fitness is definitely body-mind. Baby
boomers want a kinder, gentler workout now. Many have been injured
by high-impact aerobics, and they've gotten more educated about
their internal health as well as their external beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Come January, gyms across the country will also start teaching
Jo Sand, ``a new concept in total fitness,'' as the press release
says, developed by Johnny G (ne Goldberg), the daddy of Spinning.
Students will design their own stick ``which becomes a metaphor for
your life.'' There's more: Moving your body in sync with the stick,
``you discover your power and become aware of your inner strength.
Jo Sand takes the emphasis away from raw physical strength and
places it in the strongest muscle of all: the mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Suitably lulled by all this talk about the mind, I took my place
in the capoiera class taught by Edna Lima. Capoiera was developed
hundreds of years ago by Africans enslaved in Brazil, she
explained. ``It was martial arts disguised as a dance. They would
pretend they were dancing while they developed the skills and
techniques to run away and get their freedom back.''
</P>
<P>
   Really? I couldn't see how anyone could even think of running
while trying to execute these deep lunges and squats. Ms. Lima's
lower body seemed elastic as she assumed the crouching stance and
moved like a panther, her behind slinking along right above the
floor. Mine stuck up into the air, refusing to slink. ``Drop it,''
she yelled to me and to another woman in an identical pose. Once I
did, she had gone on to a set of O-shaped kicks that I attempted
once the room quit tilting. The bend-over-grab-your-ankle steps had
left me red-faced and dizzy.
</P>
<P>
   I finally grasped the mind connection when mine insisted I stop,
though the class was only at its halfway mark. If her legs were
elastic, mine were jelly. I'm not in terrible shape, either, or at
least I didn't think I was. Since I didn't know stepping was dead,
I still do it at home with tapes. As I crumpled onto the floor, I
couldn't help noticing that I was a good 10 to 15 years older than
most of the other students.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of the hour I watched as people turned cartwheels
in formation and used some moves that looked straight out of ``West
Side Story.'' Many of them also study the authentic capoiera with
Ms. Lima at Revolution Studios at 104 W. 14th St. ``It is not
repetitive like Tae-Bo,'' she said. It brings body and mind
together. It is an art to exercise you and condition you to think.
It's about concentration and focus, each movement built onto the
next.''

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 230 or 227.
PLEASE NOTE: THERE IS NO ATTENDANCE CHART WASHINGTON, Nov. 12 --
The following chart shows how senators and representatives voted on
key bills and amendments within the last week. A ``Y'' means the
member voted for the measure; an ``N'' means the member voted
against the measure; a ``?'' means the member did not vote; and a
``P'' means the member voted ``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: MINWAGE
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday approved, 53 to 44, an amendment to raise
the minimum wage and cut taxes. The measure, attached to a
bankruptcy reform bill, would raise the hourly wage by $1 to $6.15
over 28 months, and cut taxes by $18.4 billion over five years for
small businesses. Supporters said the bill would make the minimum
wage reflect the reality of the marketplace and give tax relief to
small businesses. Opponents, including President Clinton who said
he would veto the measure, said the bill was a ``cynical tool'' to
give tax breaks to special interests. A ``yes'' vote favors the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: MINWAGE2
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday failed to pass an amendment to raise the
minimum wage by $1 over 13 months and cut taxes by $1.5 billion
over five years. Voting 50 to 47, the Senate tabled, or set aside,
the Democratic-sponsored measure. Supporters said the amendment,
attached to a bankruptcy reform bill, would bring a much-needed pay
raise. Opponents said the measure did not provide sufficient tax
relief for employers that would have to support the pay hike. A
``yes'' vote tables the measure.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: COCAINE
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday approved, 50 to 48, an amendment to
strengthen penalties for selling powder cocaine and for selling all
illegal drugs to minors. The provision, attached to a bankruptcy
reform bill, would make the punishment for selling powder cocaine
comparable to the punishment for dealing crack, which is currently
more severe. Supporters said the bill provides a more appropriate
penalty for powder cocaine violations. Opponents said they would
rather scale back the penalty for selling crack. A ``yes'' vote
favors the measure.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: MOSELEY
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday approved, 95 to 2, the nomination of
former Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun, D-Ill., as ambassador to New
Zealand. Supporters said she was fit for the position. Opponents
questioned her ethics in handling campaign and personal finances. A
``yes'' vote favors the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   VOTE : 1 2 3 4
</P>
<P>
   --- --- --- ---
</P>
<P>
   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: FOREIGN
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Nov. 5, the House approved, 316 to 100, a compromise
$15.3 billion foreign aid bill. The bill includes $2.6 billion more
for the Wye River Middle East peace accord, international debt
relief and economic assistance than the original bill. Supporters
said the bill sufficiently funds foreign aid initiatives. Opponents
said the bill offsets funding from programs they consider more
important. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: E-COMM
</P>
<P>
   The House on Tuesday approved, 356 to 66, a bill to give
electronic documents and contracts the same legal standing as those
written on paper. Supporters said the bill was crucial to the
development of electronic commerce. Opponents said it would relax
consumer protections. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: FATHERS
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 328 to 93, a bill to support
fathers in lower income families. The measure would grant $150
million over six years to nonprofit groups that provide job
training for young parents. Supporters said the bill helps men meet
their responsibilities as fathers. Opponents said it violates the
separation of church and state by giving federal funds to churches.
A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.

 NEW YORK: the next.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The next morning, I took my sorry lower body back to Duomo,
completely unprepared for Nathalie Levy-Koffler, who was an
instructor in krav maga during her stint in the Israeli Army, from
1986 to 1988. She was first in her class of 30 _ the other 29 being
men. I was genuinely impressed. Having grown up in New York, I am
an expert at mouth-to-mouth combat, but that's about it.
</P>
<P>
   Krav maga is street fighting, Ms. Levy-Koffler explained. Its
literal translation is ``contact combat,'' which means a series of
chops and blows that if delivered correctly can break someone's
eardrums or blind him. I had no idea I had signed up for Camp
Entebbe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intifada was a Cold War, so we had to go harder with
self-defense,'' Ms. Levy-Koffler said. ``We started to use the gun
to injure them, not to kill them.'' She picked up a 9-pound body
bar. ``This is like the gun a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever made her think of translating this kind of thing into
an aerobic exercise? She smiled. ``People are thirsty for new
information,'' she said. ``You know how New Yorkers get bored with
what they have.''
</P>
<P>
   This class was smaller than capoiera, and most students were
newcomers, though one woman, an aerobics instructor in Israel, was
studying Ms. Levy-Koffler's version to teach there. And Henry Levy,
Ms. Levy-Koffler's brother, will also teach her techniques in this
country.
</P>
<P>
   As the Arabic music pounded through the speakers, Ms.
Levy-Koffler instructed: ``You have two enemies next to you. One in
front, one on the side.'' She demonstrated arm blocks and punches,
calling out, ``Protect your face,'' and I quickly found my upper
body was as weak as my lower body was sore.
</P>
<P>
   Then she went on to show us the hammer move. ``It goes to the
base of the skull, and it can paralyze or kill someone,'' she said.
Everyone repeated the chopping movement until they were sweating.
One woman rubbed her arm, and another woman, red-faced, had to sit
down. I was right behind her.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Levy-Koffler brought a male student to the front to
demonstrate the finer points of kneeing someone in the groin,
cautioning not to go too high. ``That's the pubic bone, not the
groin,'' she called. She showed how to kick from the hip at the
imaginary enemy. ``After the hammer, he's crashing, so help him to
go down faster.'' Her kick from the side was a perfect straight
line.
</P>
<P>
   The students were panting by now, and she sent them out for
water. ``This is a class for beginners, man,'' she muttered.
</P>
<P>
   When they came back, she had them take partners and work with
the body bars. ``Pivot in _ that's it, use your hip. Push, kick,
groin, then go for the knee.'' She turned to the man who was her
partner and said, ``No, here's my groin. Here.'' The Israeli army,
it seems, teaches equal opportunity kicking.
</P>
<P>
   After the class, Evelyn Daitchman, an elated first-time student,
said: ``This makes you so present. You're alert, and in a certain
way you feel relaxed when you're alert. You're very present and
powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Levy-Koffler, who is also a personal trainer, teaches the
authentic krav maga privately.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you feel more secure in yourself,'' she said. ``I
have women who have had problems with rapes, or battered women, who
took my classes. You don't have to be flexible or fit. You don't
have to be the champion of the world. High kicks are nice, but low
kicks are effective.'' She grinned. ``My master in Israel was 300
pounds and short, but he would kick low and break a leg.''
</P>
<P>
   Lovely. Whatever happened to ``Hava Nagila''?

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   The contiguous states will be virtually bereft of precipitation
Saturday as a two-pronged high pressure system resides over much of
the southern two-thirds of the nation. The easternmost high,
centered over the lower Mississippi Valley, will also prevent
moisture over the Gulf of Mexico from streaming northward.
</P>
<P>
   In northeast New England, however, a few pockets of chilly rain
or snow will affect Maine as a weak area of low pressure with
limited access to Atlantic moisture drifts east across the Gulf of
Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, isolated showers will form near Florida's east
coast, but most places will stay dry. Areas of low clouds may
affect parts of northeast Florida early in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, record to near-record warmth will build in the Great
Plains under the auspices of an expansive ridge of warm high
pressure. Temperatures could approach 80 degrees as far north as
Nebraska. The warm spell will break by Sunday across the central
and southern Plains as a cool front surges southward. On Saturday,
the cool front will advance into the northern Plains and northern
Great Lakes, accompanied by gusty winds from the north. Very little
rain will attend the front, owing to a lack of moisture.
</P>
<P>
   Farther west, spotty, generally light rains will occur from
northern Washington to the Bitterroot Mountains as a streak of fast
winds at altitudes near 30,000 feet promote rising currents of air.
</P>
<P>
   Record to near-record warmth is possible across interior
California in response to a second center of high pressure over the
Great Basin.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Fire Danger
</P>
<P>
   With hunters poised to venture into the woods in northern lower
Michigan, there is growing concern about wildfires. Persistently
dry and warm conditions across the upper Middle West have allowed
grasses, leaves and brush to turn tinder dry, creating ample ground
fuel for wildfires. Though a cold front will arrive this weekend,
it will pass without much rain, owing to a dearth of moisture. With
moisture from the Gulf of Mexico prevented from streaming northward
by a high pressure system over the lower Mississippi River,
substantial rains in Michigan are unlikely through next Wednesday.

   WEATHERFORD, Texas _ A windmill thief is on the loose in Parker

trailer. He has twirled ropes for presidents, singers, movie stars

entertainers in the National Cowboy Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City.

   NEW YORK _ Two young filmmakers who bombed out with their first
documentary (``Watering the Apple,'' a three-hour-plus salute to
New York's drinking water) decide to do their second on a Los
Angeles private eye. Things get complicated, though, when the
cheating wife they're shadowing for a client turns out to be
sleeping with the private eye's partner. Soon the partner, who
flees to Mexico with $40,000, turns up dead.
</P>
<P>
   Since the private eye is grieving, the filmmakers take over the
case. The woman they're all following turns out to be not the
client's wife but his secretary and paramour, who was indeed
cheating on him. They learn this when the real wife turns up. She's
beautiful, blond and rich and likes the looks of one of the young
filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The private eye has an inspiration, heads for a beach hotel in
Ensenada, figures it all out and arrests the culprit. The
filmmakers have enjoyed all this so much that it looks as if
they'll be taking up investigating full time.
</P>
<P>
   If the film ``Where's Marlowe?'' sounds like the pilot of a
one-hour detective series, that's exactly what it was meant to be.
It might have been acceptable prime-time entertainment, if the
regulars grew on you.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Ferrer does a nice job as the private eye. John
Livingston and Mos Def (who is also a hip-hop performer) are both
attractive and likable as the filmmakers. But ``Where's Marlowe?''
has little energy and nothing much to say beyond the message that
hunting down murderers can be fun.
</P>
<P>
   The best part of the film is a funny sequence at the end about a
gun, an elderly woman who faints, two neighbors and a misbehaving
dog.

   JAPAN-DISCRIM (Tokyo) _ Launching what may one day be looked
back on as the Japanese equivalent of Rosa Park's defiance of bus
segregation in Montgomery, Ala., Ana Bortz, a 35-year-old reporter
for a Brazilian satellite television network, took on the
discrimination against foreigners in Japan's courts, and to the

   REPUBS-CONGRESS (Washington) _ As this year's congressional
session sputters to an end, Republicans are quietly ceding ground
to President Clinton in budget talks in their determination to
avoid the conflagrations of the past, which culminated in a
government shutdown in 1996. The Republicans' mood of resignation
underscores how much they viewed this first session of 106th
Congress as about little more than survival under dire
circumstances. By Alison Mitchell.

   MRSCLINTON-POLITICS _ Among many Democrats, the question was not
why Hillary Rodham Clinton had sat silently in Ramallah as the wife
of Yasser Arafat seemingly accused Israelis of poisoning
Palestinian women and children. The question was why Mrs. Clinton
had agreed to go to the West Bank in the first place _ and then why
it took her a full day to offer a full response to Suha Arafat's

OFF THE PAGE AND ONTO A PC SCREEN: AN ENCYLOPEDIC MIRROR OF WHAT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the early years of this fading millennium, two words often
appeared in encyclopedia titles: ``speculum'' (mirror) and
``imago'' (image). Encyclopedias were meant to reflect the world
while also giving it shape. And what enormous mirrors they were!
One Chinese encyclopedia from the 13th century filled 240 volumes.
The German-language General Encyclopedia (1818-89) reached volume
167 and was never even completed.
</P>
<P>
   These textual universes were also meant to reflect the divisions
and categories of the surrounding world. The 10th-century Arabic
encyclopedia, Mafatih al-'Ulum (Key to the Sciences), was split
into two sections: indigenous knowledge (including jurisprudence,
secretarial duties and history) and foreign knowledge (philosophy,
logic, alchemy). One 12th-century European encyclopedia devoted an
entire section to a chronicle of events since Satan's fall.
</P>
<P>
   The Enlightenment changed the categories, but not the ambition.
Francis Bacon, in the plans for his encyclopedia, intended ``to
commence a total reconstruction of sciences, arts, and all human
knowledge, raised upon the proper foundations.'' Until a few
hundred years ago, merely alphabetical organization was considered
to be, in Coleridge's words, a sign of ``impudent ignorance'' that
presented the world as a ``huge, unconnected miscellany.''
</P>
<P>
   Forgive the encyclopedic introduction. I have been reading the
25,000-word entry on encyclopedia in the Britannica. After seeing
sales of its $1,500 set drop 80 percent in the early 1990s, after
stumbling into the Internet era a few years ago with a failed paid
subscription site, after being sold to a Swiss financier, the
Britannica _ the oldest and largest English encyclopedia _ became
freely available on the Internet (at www.britannica.com) in
October.
</P>
<P>
   Britannica is changing from an encyclopedia into a ``portal,''
an entry point into the Web, including news (from The Washington
Post), weather, stock quotes and e-mail. Advertisements,
tailor-made for encyclopedia entries, will provide income. There
will also be be ``e-commerce'' deals and an online store.
Britannica wants to become an Internet brand.
</P>
<P>
   This may have some advantages. Jorge Cauz, Britannica's senior
vice president for marketing, said a 100-member editorial staff is
setting up three-year cycles of continuous revision. About 50
percent of the text will remain intact over time; the total text
will end up being larger by about a third, and ``broader topical
references'' will be included.
</P>
<P>
   But the very nature of the encyclopedia may also change. From
its first edition (1768) in Scotland, the Britannica's world mirror
was formed out of meticulously molded smaller ones. In its 14
editions, the Britannica published classic entries: Swinburne on
Keats, John Muir on Yosemite, Freud on psychoanalysis, Houdini on
conjuring, Einstein on space-time.
</P>
<P>
   The Britannica's alphabetical organization, far from creating
``a huge unconnected miscellany,'' became a sign of both humility
and grandeur: humility because it acknowledged that no system could
encompass the world in all its complexity, and grandeur because it
asserted that there was still a way to present that immensity for
human delectation.
</P>
<P>
   But about a decade ago, this model changed; it has been most
clearly reflected in Microsoft's CD-ROM encyclopedia, Encarta. The
new structure of knowledge is not conceptual or alphabetical. It is
technological. ``Features'' organize the encyclopedic world: time
lines, panoramic views, videos, audio snippets, virtual tours,
games.
</P>
<P>
   Encarta's actual content, in fact, often seems an accompaniment
to the razzle-dazzle technology. Monthly updates are available on
the Internet for a subscription fee and each year has seen welcome
improvements. But most of the text comes from Funk &AMP; Wagnall's and
Collier's _ decidedly second-rate encyclopedias.
</P>
<P>
   So don't expect Encarta to be too revealing about
``encyclopedias,'' for example (an entry gives incorrect dates for
the Britannica). Even a subject close to Encarta's technological
heart _ the ``Internet'' _ is oddly treated; the Encarta 2000
edition has little information after 1997 and a sidebar is offered
from an antediluvian 1994 entry. Patchwork and miscellany seem more
common than systematic interpretations, a symptom perhaps of
hypertext and multimedia obsessions.
</P>
<P>
   But the new technology isn't a problem in itself. It can provide
unusual opportunities to search, listen and watch, as in the
fascinating new release of Encarta Africana (Microsoft), with its
surveys of black American and African culture. And there are times
when the technology, even if imperfectly applied to a dated text,
is still of great use, as in the invaluable CD-ROM of the
Encyclopedia Judaica (Judaica Multimedia). Even Britannica's own
CD-ROM uses technology to illumine the text. The danger comes when
technology, instead of being a tool, determines the content.
</P>
<P>
   For Britannica, though, the greatest risk may be not in
technological excess, but in Internet access. If income depends on
e-commerce, will emphases change to court clicks? Will as many
resources be devoted to a rarely consulted scholarly entry on, say,
Baroque opera as to a popular and commercially supported entry on,
say, rock music? Right now, the Web site offers a ``Britannica.com
happening'' featuring ``psychedelic rock'': it urges you to ``turn
off your mind, relax and float downstream.''
</P>
<P>
   If systematic changes take place _ and the company insists they
will not _ the new categories of knowledge won't be in history or
divinity or the alphabet; they will be in revenue and click count.
Britannica.com would be constantly creating itself in response to
the demands of its readers. That sort of speculum might accurately
reflect the current universe, but not quite in the way the creators
of great encyclopedias had in mind.

IN DEFENSE OF GEORGE W. BUSH
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Monday, Nov. 15)  
(mk) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is concern in some circles that front-running Republican
presidential candidate George W. Bush may be _ how can I put this
delicately? _ an idiot.
</P>
<P>
   This concern was heightened recently when Bush failed to name
the leaders of Chechnya, India and Pakistan, three of the leading
grain-producing states in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   I, personally, think these concerns are overblown. Even though I
am a highly trained professional journalist who prides himself on
his accuracy, I know that it's impossible for anyone to know
everything, especially if, like Bush, you grew up in a rundown
Florida trailer park and dropped out of school in the third grade.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush is such a dumb-bunny, then why did the good people of
Minnesota elect him governor? Because they see things in George W.
Bush that the rest of us don't, that's why.
</P>
<P>
   While it's true that Bush doesn't have the fancy Ivy League
education of some of the other candidates, he has a graduate degree
from the ``school of hard knocks,'' which is more than you can say
about Elizabeth Dole and Dan Quayle, two Republicans whose
campaigns continue to gain strength.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was a popular professional wrestler back in the '80s who
went by the name ``Dubya the Destroyer.'' He is probably best
remembered for punching out the lights of comedian Andy Kaufman on
the David Letterman show, April 3, 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was also a member of the elite Navy Seals and once rode
atop the back of Shamu at Sea World.
</P>
<P>
   I doubt seriously if the voters care that Bush can't tell the
difference between Aslan Maskhadov and Pervaiz Musharraf, two of
the better, modestly priced cabernet sauvignons from Chile that
recently received favorable reviews in The Wine Spectator.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do voters care if Bush is a little light on the subject of
foreign affairs. There are a lot (27) of countries in the world and
many of them are located far away and have hard-to-pronounce names.
I believe, and many (27) other Americans believe, that if these
foreign countries want to be better remembered, they should stop
calling themselves things like Herzegovina or Uzbekistan and change
their name to something more familiar and easily remembered like,
say, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   It would also help if the press asked Bush questions about
something he is more familiar with, like baseball. As everyone in
his home state of Minnesota knows, George Bush is part-owner of the
Minnesota Twins, the team that won the 1999 World Series by beating
the Atlanta Braves four games to zip. If you asked Bush a question
about the Twins' star third-baseman, Cal Ripken, I'm sure he'd be
more likely to answer correctly than if you asked him some arcane
foreign-policy question, like who won World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, George W. Bush has been harshly and unfairly judged as
an intellectual lightweight simply because he's a little spotty on
world leaders and geography. What's the worst that could happen? He
confuses Canada with Cuba and reduces Winnipeg to radioactive slag?
Hey, even presidents make mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, even if he's not the sharpest knife in the drawer, Bush
has enough sense to surround himself with knowledgeable advisers,
which is a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some people have suggested I hire some myself, though I
can't imagine why.

   DRUGS-DEBATE-REVIEW (Washington) _ Hardly a day has gone by
recently when drug policy and the pharmaceutical industry have not
been at the top of the news in stories that reflect the tension
between the scientific and financial accomplishments of the
pharmaceutical manufacturers and the unmet needs of a society that
increasingly depends on the industry. By David E. Rosenbaum.

new South Africa is a place they no longer understand, a country in
which they grope for a sense of belonging. This new sense of

South Africa's whites that vents and explores the fears even as it
helps focus them into a new outlook on the post-apartheid nation.

   GOVERNMENT-BIZ-REVIEW (Washington) _ A look at the
transformation going on in markets and how the government regulates
them. The new law removing barriers between banking, insurance and
securities does little more than allow Washington to catch up with
the sweeping changes that have reshaped the financial services
industry over the past few decades. Other major impending changes
involve health care, the burgeoning online industry and the
Microsoft antitrust case. By Richard W. Stevenson.

   PRESCHOOL-EMOTIONS-REVIEW (Undated) _ When educators gather this
week in New Orleans for a national conference on teaching young
children, the focus will be on anger management: aggression
prevention, self-regulation and emotion control. The themes may
seem more suited for adults in mid-life crisis than 3-year-olds,
but they are part of an evolving movement to develop and offer
formal lessons in the ABCs of feelings to children under 5. By
Doreen Carvajal.

<P>
   OCEAN-RECOVERY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Lost at sea once meant exactly
that: irretrievably vanished beneath the waves. But in recent years
there has been a remarkable shift in the public imagination. People
have come to expect the sea to reveal its graves. And in some
cases, they have expected investigators to tease insights from
sunken ships and plane wreckage as easily as if the doomed craft
were resting in a cornfield. By C.J. Chivers.

didn't reduce the amount of mail people send. Now, the theory goes,
the Internet will not, either. The underlying message, however, is

Blair's modernizing juggernaut. As they left, many Britons paused
to indulge in a bit of nostalgia for the old days, when the landed
aristocracy ran the country and to be a hereditary peer really
meant something. By Sarah Lyall,

   SUDAN-U.S.-REVIEW (Undated) _ Most Americans don't care about
Sudan, but the few who do have made it a rarity in U.S. foreign
policy: an African nation with an American constituency.
Schoolchildren raise money to buy back slaves. Fundamentalists in
Congress, troubled by Sudan's war on its Christians, are finding
common ground with black legislators concerned about slavery.

   COLOMBIA-VIOLENCE-REVIEW (Bogota) _ What makes Colombia so
brutal a society? To the toll of those killed by paramilitary
groups and guerrillas in the region's longest-running civil
conflict must be added those murdered by drug cartels and criminal
gangs, as well as the 140 young boys kidnapped, tortured, raped and

incomprehensible at first hearing, and, once learned, often easily
forgettable. By Seth Faison.

NOMINATIONS FROM CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   BOXER FORCES VOTE ON TWO JUDICIAL (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The longest wait in the history of federal judicial
nominations will come to an end by early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly four years after President Clinton nominated Richard Paez
to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers California and
eight other western states, the Senate vote will finally vote on
his nomination by March 15.
</P>
<P>
   The end to Paez's Cal Ripkin-like streak came after Sen. Barbara
Boxer, D-Calif., held up a Senate vote on the nomination of a
friend of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. Her move was a
retaliation against conservative Republicans for blocking votes on
Paez and another California nominee to the Ninth Circuit, Marsha L.
Berzon. Her nomination has been pending for nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Republican senators objected to Berzon, a federal
appeals attorney from San Francisco who is also a member of the
board of the American Civil Liberties Union, and Paez, a U.S.
district court judge in Los Angeles, on the basis that they were
too liberal.
</P>
<P>
   However, Democrats pointed out that both Berzon and Paez have
gained the support of several prominent Republicans, including Rep.
James Rogan, R-Calif., a floor manager during the impeachment
hearings against Clinton, and Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of
the Senate Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch went so far as to call Berzon one of the most qualified
nominees he has ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, Democrats had showcased the stalled
nominations of Berzon and Paez to make their argument that Senate
Republicans were slow in dealing with judicial nominees who were
female or members of minority groups. The Republicans denied the
accusation.
</P>
<P>
   To gain leverage against the Republican majority, Boxer last
month took a political hostage of her own, holding up a Senate vote
on the nomination of Glenn McCullough, the mayor of Tupelo, Miss.,
to the board of the Tennessee Valley Authority. McCullough had been
nominated by Clinton as a favor to Lott.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer invoked a Senate rule allowing an individual senator to
put a ``hold'' on a bill, effectively blocking floor action on the
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sen. Boxer decided that after waiting nearly four years for a
vote, she needed to push along the process'' said David Sandretti,
a spokesman for Boxer.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday night, Lott and Minority Leader Thomas A.
Daschle, D-S.D., broke the logjam. Lott agreed to let the Senate
vote on the two Californians' nominations by March 15, and Boxer
agreed to let the Senate vote on McCullough. Later that evening,
the Senate confirmed McCullough's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been frustrating waiting for this reasonable request to
be granted, but I am gratified that this day has come and that
Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon will get their vote,'' Boxer said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Latino leaders applauded the agreement to push the nominations
to a floor vote and praised Boxer for her efforts on the nominee's
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very excited that the Republican leadership finally has
made the commitment to give these two qualified individuals the
chance they deserve,'' said Marisa Demeo, regional counsel for the
Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, a
Washington-based advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too bad that Sen. Boxer needed to do what she did, but we
thank her for doing it and believe she did the right thing,'' she
said.

</P>
<P>
   Currently, seven of the 28 positions on the U.S. Ninth Circuit
Court of Appeals are vacant. Court officials have said that 800
appeals due for action will not be considered this year because of
the judge shortage.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Chief Justice William Rehnquist, while not commenting
directly on the Ninth Circuit's judge shortage, has said that, in
general, unfilled vacancies are the most serious problem facing the
federal courts, and that after nominees' credentials are reviewed,
the Senate should vote.

   SATURDAY'S KEY GAMES
</P>
<P>
   No. 5 Kansas State 9-0
</P>
<P>
   No. 8 at Nebraska 8-1
</P>
<P>
   The winner has a clear path to the Big 12 North title. Nebraska
decimated Texas A&AMP;M last Saturday with eight sacks and two blocked
field-goal attempts and allowed only 2 yards rushing. Kansas State
stopped Colorado's passing game until it gave up two long touchdown
passes and barely hung on.
</P>
<P>
   No. 16 Mississippi State 8-0
</P>
<P>
   No. 6 at Alabama 7-2
</P>
<P>
   These are the best teams in the Southeastern Conference's West
Division. Mississippi State has the nation's stingiest total
defense (198.5 yards a game) and rushing defense (54 yards a game).
Alabama lost four defensive starters to injuries last week.
</P>
<P>
   No. 12 Michigan 7-2
</P>
<P>
   No. 9 at Penn State 9-1
</P>
<P>
   Penn State, chancy on offense all season, lost to Minnesota on a
last-second field goal, and life gets no easier. The Nittany Lions
close against Michigan and Michigan State. Michigan ends with Penn
State and Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   No. 13 Miami 5-3
</P>
<P>
   No. 4 at Virginia Tech 8-0
</P>
<P>
   The winner is headed for the Big East title and Virginia Tech
has designs on the national title. Eleven times since 1983, Miami
has knocked teams out of the battle for No. 1, but that is a tall
order here.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame (5-4)
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   No. 19 Clemson (5-4)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 22 Georgia Tech (6-2)

   No. 14 Louisiana Tech (7-2)
</P>
<P>
   at Alabama-Birmingham (4-5)
</P>

   Tim Rattay, Tech's passing star, faces a difficult defense.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn (4-5)
</P>
<P>
   at Georgia (6-2)
</P>
<P>
   Georgia may have trouble rushing against this defense.
</P>
<P>
   MIDWEST
</P>
<P>
   No. 17 Michigan State (7-2)
</P>
<P>
   at Northwestern (3-6)
</P>
<P>
   An easy one for Michigan State's defense, which held Ohio State
to 79 yards.
</P>
<P>
   No. 18 Marshall (9-0)
</P>
<P>
   at Western Michigan (7-2)
</P>
<P>
   Marshall, sure to reach the Motor City Bowl, wants a bigger one.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana (4-5)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 21 Minnesota (6-3)
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota is reveling in its first winning season since 1990.

game.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Tech (5-4)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 15 Texas (8-2)
</P>
<P>
   Texas can clinch a spot in the Big 12 championship game.
</P>

<P>
   No. 7 Brigham Young (8-1)
</P>
<P>
   at Wyoming (5-3)
</P>
<P>
   Brigham Young, winner of six straight, could be tested here.
</P>
<P>
   No. 11 Washington (6-3)
</P>
<P>
   at U.C.L.A. (3-6)
</P>
<P>
   Washington is two victories away from the Rose Bowl.
</P>

<P>
   Maryland (5-4)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 1 Florida State (9-0)

   Coach Bobby Bowden on Florida State's weekly slow first half:
``It scares me, but as long as they end up like they ended up, I
can survive, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 3 Florida (8-1)
</P>
<P>
   at South Carolina (0-9)
</P>
<P>
   Florida's passing game is erratic. It doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa (1-8)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 19 Wisconsin (8-2)
</P>

A COLD WAR TURNING POINT ON TAPE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until now, there have been only memories of Nikita S.
Khrushchev's furious tongue-lashing of the famous Russian poet
Andrei Voznesensky during a Kremlin meeting on March 7, 1963. But
in a newly uncovered audio tape, the scornful voice of the Soviet
leader _ the man who first launched the great thaw ending the
Stalin era and then tried to crush it _ can be heard in a landmark
confrontation that signaled a clampdown on artistic and
intellectual freedom.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Voznesensky, now 63, obtained the tape, which was
unearthed by a Moscow television journalist in a closed government
archive in the provincial Russian town of Penza.
</P>
<P>
   Khrushchev's explosive outburst that March day was seen as a
calculated attempt to silence artists and writers like Voznesensky,
whose poetry recitals were packing stadiums. Then 29, Voznesensky
was among the literary and intellectual elite summoned to a two-day
meeting of the political leadership. Others included Aleksandr
Solzhenitsyn, playwright Vasily Aktsonov and sculptor Ernst
Neizvestny.
</P>
<P>
   Khrushchev's rant, translated off the tape by Audrey Beeber
David, began shortly after Voznesensky rose to say that like the
great Russian poet of the 1920s, Vladimir Mayakovsky, he was not a
Communist Party member. In a mocking voice, Khrushchev interrupted
Voznesensky's every sentence, as the audience applauded:
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to challenge us? We'll grind you to dust. And we will
turn to dust anyone who is an obstacle to the Communist Party . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Now there will be no thaw, no melting, but instead a frost
will descend. For people like you we will make a rock-solid
frost.''
</P>
<P>
   Comparing Voznesensky with his disaffected mentor, Boris
Pasternak, Khrushchev told Voznesensky he should leave the country:
``Would you like to receive your passport tomorrow? You can even
get it today, if you like. And then get the hell out of here, you
Devil.''

 &HT;    AIRPORTS, TRAVELERS COULD SUFFER FROM CONGRESSIONAL IMPASSE
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Airports will be squeezed and passengers will soon
feel the pinch, aviation experts said Friday about the collapse of
congressional efforts to pass a major funding bill for the nation's
overburdened air transportation system.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a real big disappointment,'' said Darryl Jenkins,
director of the Aviation Institute at George Washington University.
House and Senate negotiators deadlocked earlier this week in the
latest failed attempt to pass a long-range improvement plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our system is antiquated. It was never meant to deal with the
traffic we have,'' Jenkins said. ``And now we're at gridlock and
we're at a point that's going to become a safety problem. That is
not that far away.''
</P>
<P>
   His dire warning, echoed by others, came as airports braced for
delays and cutbacks in construction projects.
</P>
<P>
   Especially hard hit would be small and medium-sized air fields,
said Todd Hauptli, a lobbyist for the American Association of
Airport Executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The larger airports will have other funding sources'' such as
local bond issues, he said, adding that the rest are more reliant
on federal funding that is now stuck in limbo on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Austin-Bergstrom International Airport, for example, will have
to pay extra for financing its recently built facility if a
promised $10 million grant is delayed.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Gates, director of finance and administration, said the
airport would also have to scale back a planned $15 million
noise-abatement program to buy out some homeowners and build
buffers to reduce the impact on others. Federal grants are supposed
to pay 75 percent of the cost.
</P>
<P>
   At Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport, officials on
Friday were still studying possible effects of an impasse in
Congress, said airport development official Art Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's Palm Beach International Airport would probably not
have to change its development plans, spokeswoman Lisa Waters said.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional deadlock is the latest glitch after years of
attempts to provide long-range planning and reliable funding for
increasingly strained airports. Much of the air traffic control
system is still operating with 20-year-old equipment, coping with
increasing congestion in the skies.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. General Accounting Office, the bipartisan research and
investigative arm of Congress, has concluded that airport
improvement spending is $3 billion a year short of what's required
to keep up with the growing numbers of travelers, now at 600
million a year.
</P>
<P>
   House negotiators want to spend all of the $10 billion collected
each year from airline ticket fees for airport improvements and add
a higher contribution from the U.S. Treasury. Senate negotiators
have balked at the plan, drawing a heated response from House
Transportation chairman Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Pa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Worshipping at the altar of fiscal short-sightedness will
carry a high price when our aviation system becomes hopelessly
congested,'' Shuster said. ``If we do not make the investments that
are necessary we risk the destruction of one of the economic
engines that keeps our economy roaring.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain of Arizona, chairman of the Commerce Committee
that oversees air travel issues, also expressed disappointment at
the failure to compromise. McCain, a Republican presidential
hopeful, has been wary of a House plan to allow airports to
increase airport passenger fees from $3 to a maximum of $6, a move
that smacks of a tax increase.
</P>
<P>
   Hauptli said he has not given up on the legislation for this
year. ``There's still time on the clock,'' he said, before Congress
ends the last session of the century, probably by the middle of
next week.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater has weighed in by making
phone calls to the players on Capitol Hill. But those pushing for
action say that all of the efforts are too little, too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys waited to the last minute to try to work out a
compromise,'' Jenkins said. ``We're at a crunch point. There's no
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   If the current effort fails, Congress is expected to try again
next year.
</P>
<P>
   However, last Wednesday the air traffic system sent up another
symbolic warning flare. A computer breakdown in Memphis grounded
traffic for nearly two hours in cities around the South from Miami
to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's unfortunate is that we're all beginning to become
accustomed to these things,'' Jenkins said.

 By ELIZABETH HAYT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dr. Seth Matarasso's patients often book an entire
morning or afternoon for treatments. ``We'll start from the bottom
with the leg veins and work our way to the top, with the liver
spots on the hands and back,'' said Dr. Matarasso, a dermatologist
in San Francisco. ``Then, we do their Botox, collagen and
Derma-Peel. We may even do a micro-liposuction underneath the neck
and around the knees.''
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, Dr. Frederic Brandt sees patients in an office that
looks like a cosmetics boutique, with limestone floors, milk-glass
fixtures and a display case filled with his own brand of skin
creams, soon to be sold at Bergdorf Goodman. Brandt, 50, is a
walking advertisement for the Botox injections he relies on to
remain wrinkle-free. He forsakes a white lab coat in favor of
head-to-toe Prada Sport. ``Some of my patients call me Dr. Prada,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the age of the new dermatology, the once humble medical
specialty that is elbowing aside plastic surgery as a glamour
profession. Gone are the days when acne sufferers shamefully
scurried to a skin doctor to have pimples popped in drab green
examining rooms. Today's skin doctors, repackaged as beauty gurus,
are marketing their own cosmetics, promising to reverse the effects
of aging and _ the latest trend _ opening their own day spas,
complete with facials, seaweed wraps and a nice soak in a Jacuzzi.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan, around the corner from Balthazar, a 36-foot
waterfall cascades into a pond at the SoHo Integrative Health
Center. The treatments include massage, acupuncture and ayurvedic
medicine. ``We're Zen with a medical edge,'' said Dr. Laurie Polis,
a board-certified dermatologist, who is the director. ``We're
open-minded and New Age without being full of baloney.''
</P>
<P>
   She has plenty of competition among dermatologists jumping on
the day-spa bandwagon. The number of day spas in New York City has
doubled in the last two years, to more than 50. The example of the
celebrity-friendly Bliss _ opened in SoHo in 1996 and sold for a
reported $30 million to LVMH Moet Hennessy-Louis Vuitton last year
_ is a beacon to all with a professional interest in blackhead-free
pores. In the same Broadway building as Bliss, Dr. Bradford
Katchen, a dermatologist, plans to open a 4,000-square-foot
skin-care center, the SkinCareLab, in January, which will provide
hair removal, manicures and pedicures. The unique selling
proposition that separates him from spas operated by nonphysicians,
Katchen said, is his ``almost 20 years studying skin care and its
physiology.''
</P>
<P>
   Contemplating the rise of medically supervised day spas, Dr.
Steven Mandy, a dermatologist in Aspen, Colo., put it bluntly:
``Beauty is where the money is. We have a baby boomer population in
their late 40s that is very concerned about their appearance.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, ``doctors have had their income severely
restricted by managed health care,'' he said, adding, ``Cosmetic
procedures are outside the realm of managed care.''
</P>
<P>
   But as cosmetic dermatology becomes higher profile, there is
concern that general dermatology, or the treatment of skin
diseases, will suffer. Although no figures exist for the percentage
of cosmetic dermatologists among the United States' 8,000
dermatologists, Dr. Mark Lebwohl, the chairman of the department of
dermatology at Mount Sinai Medical School, said: ``I am concerned
that serious, medical dermatology not be neglected.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are not enough dermatologists to serve the medical needs
in places like Wisconsin, Georgia and upstate New York,'' he said.
``There are patients walking around with psoriasis that goes
untreated and skin cancer where the diagnosis is made late.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the shortage stemmed from a number of factors, including
the greater incentive for young dermatologists to specialize in
cosmetics because insurance companies reimburse medical
dermatologists poorly.
</P>
<P>
   The change in dermatology has been evolving over two decades. In
the 1980s, Retin-A creams to treat fine facial lines, and collagen,
a wrinkle-filler and lip-plumper, first became popular, and both
continue to be in high demand today.
</P>
<P>
   But the beauty boom really picked up over the last few years
with the explosion of medical quick fixes for the aging face. Botox
injections can now smooth facial lines, Softform and Gore-Tex
implants can permanently augment the lips, and the proliferation of
lasers can resurface sun-damaged skin, remove unwanted hair and
eradicate leg veins.
</P>
<P>
   Since the mid-90s, a new class of skin-care products has emerged
known as cosmeceuticals, which are available at doctors' offices
and are classified somewhere between over-the-counter and
prescription medications. Consumers are stocking up on these
creams, cleansers and lotions, which are enriched with vitamins,
fruit acids and antioxidants, believing they are more effective for
skin care than old-fashioned formulations like Ponds cold cream.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was about the mid-'80s when women were no longer going to
the dermatologist to have a mole removed but for minor cases of
vanity,'' said Linda Wells, the editor of Allure magazine. ``More
recently, women started going to the dermatologist for mild
chemical peels and injections. This has been a big shift. Women
started treating their dermatologist as a graduated form of the
facialist.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Upper East Side, Dr. Michael Albom, a dermatologist, and
Dr. Mauro Romita, a plastic surgeon, opened Ajune in August, a
sybaritic spa for post-operative cosmetic-surgery patients. All the
treatment tables face the doors, in accordance with the principles
of feng shui. The spa sells Shu Uemura camouflage makeup; offers
endermologie, a treatment to supposedly reduce cellulite, and
teaches qi gong, a Chinese breathing therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Kilgor, the founder of Bliss, thinks doctors are in for a
surprise when they slip off their scrubs for spa uniforms. ``If I
was a dermatologist, the last thing I'd do is run a spa,'' she
sighed. ``The amount you can get per day for collagen is so much
higher in profit margin than dealing with facials and 150 staff
members.''
</P>
<P>
   Most dermatologists who offer spa treatments insist their
motivation is to improve the quality of these cosmetic services,
not to line their pockets. ``It's a natural extension of
dermatology,'' said Dr. Eileen Lambroza, a dermatologist on the
Upper East Side, who does not have a spa but has trained one of her
assistants to do facials and laser hair removal at her office.
``The facialist can be supervised; sterilization for the manicures
and pedicures can be monitored. The best products can be
customized, and if there is a reaction to the products or to the
treatment, the physician is there for decision-making.''

   KOSOVO-ALBANIANS _ PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ The problem of ethnic
violence in Kosovo province that United Nations thought we be

warplanes bombed Yugoslavia to rescue are apparently doing to the
Serbians, what was being done to them. This is making things very
complicated, and increasing the tension between the UN, Kosovar
Albanians, Russians and just about everybody else. It also makes
things tough for the people trying to raise money from private
donors, who may have their desire to help Kosovo chilled by the
sense that the Albanians are no better than the Serbs. For the
long-term, the ethnic tensions threaten any chance of Kosovo's

   ``Many of the treatments at a spa are designed to relax you and
have no medical benefits,'' said Dr. Darrell S. Rigel, the
president of the American Academy of Dermatology and a clinical
professor of dermatology at New York University Medical Center.
``They should delineate between what is a medically proven
treatment versus something that just feels good. The public makes
the assumption that just because there is a dermatologist
affiliated with the spa, all the treatments could have medical
benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Although day-spa devotees hardly seem to be suffering at the
hands of medically unsupervised aestheticians, some prefer the
atmosphere of a medical clinic. ``I'm a spa-aholic,'' confessed
Kimberly Jane Daiber, a New York designer of clothing and home
furnishings. ``I think Bliss is all right, but I don't like it not
being very scientific. I've also gone to Elizabeth Arden, the
Golden Door and the Peninsula.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel more comfortable in a doctor's environment,''
she added. ``The facials are more effective. My face feels
cleaner.''
</P>
<P>
   Services a physician can offer, with a medical license, that an
ordinary spa cannot, include: collagen and Botox injections,
various laser procedures, medium- to high-strength chemical peels
and the treatment of blood vessels, age spots, skin lesions and leg
veins.
</P>
<P>
   To create the impression that a dermatologist-run day spa
provides more effective treatments than the nonmedical variety,
some doctors are touting their own products for their therapeutic
benefits. Last April, the Juva Skin and Laser Center opened in
Midtown Manhattan, a self-described medi-spa designed by the
architects who created Frederic Fekkai's hair salon. Images of the
Grand Canyon float across flat-screen television monitors in the
waiting room, and the dermatologist who is the director, Dr. Bruce
Katz, maintains, ``We have actually incorporated medication that
has anti-aging effects into our body treatments and facials.'' He
was referring to his custom skin-care products laced with
alpha-hydroxy acids, which he said can reverse sun damage with four
to six treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Like all cosmeceuticals, his products have not been approved by
the Food and Drug Administration, and no hard claims can be made
for their effectiveness, only general promises that they enhance
beauty.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for alpha-hydroxy acids,'' said Rigel of the dermatology
academy, ``the FDA has looked into tighter regulation of them, but
their effects are so mild that it was felt they could be
administered by a nonphysician. It used to be a black-and-white
area; now it's gray.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the American Academy of Dermatology advised
dermatologists who sell products from their offices to do so ``in a
manner with the best interest of their patient as their highest
priority.'' But some skin doctors argue that the practice should be
banned outright. ``Patients need to trust that their doctor's
primary interest is in their health, not increasing the doctor's
bottom line,'' said Dr. Eileen Ringel, a dermatologist in
Waterville, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors are given certain privileges and respect in our
society, because their primary motivation is patient well-being,
and if you misuse those privileges to increase profits, it's
unethical,'' she said. ``Patients don't always understand the
difference between cosmetic recommendations and therapeutic
recommendations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I don't do any of the new dermatological
procedures,'' she said. ``I don't treat the aging face, as if
that's some sort of a disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Countering such criticism, Dr. Arnold Klein, a celebrity
dermatologist in Los Angeles, said: ``Although I think of my
practice as being a medical practice and not a beauty parlor, the
argument that dermatology is being diminished by focusing on
aesthetics goes back to the Judeo-Christian ethic that vanity is a
vice. Vanity is OK. If it wasn't, we'd all walk around in paper
bags and never bathe.''
</P>
<P>
   Cosmetic dermatology has turned out to be so profitable that
even doctors from other fields are crossing over to practice it.
The Institute Beaute on East 78th Street advertises laser hair
removal, facial peels and vein therapy, traditionally the realm of
dermatology. But the person who performs the treatments is Dr.
Everett Lautin, a radiologist, who along with a podiatrist, Dr.
Suzanne Levine, opened the beauty center a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the advertisement, neither doctor identifies a specialty. ``I
don't even understand how radiologists let leg veins get away from
them,'' said Lautin, when asked if he was going beyond his turf.
``People assume only a dermatologist can treat leg veins.''
</P>
<P>
   Under state laws, any licensed physician can practice any form
of medicine, from dermatology to brain surgery, said Dr. David J.
Goldberg, a laser surgeon and a professor of health care law at
Fordham University. But the regulations on laser hair removal vary
by state, he added. In New York, it can be done by a technician
under a physician's supervision; in New Jersey and Connecticut, for
example, the rules are stricter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, as dermatologists, see problems where people have gone to
nondermatologists,'' Rigel said. ``The issue of nondermatologists
and physicians in specialties that have nothing to do with their
training is an issue that will be bigger in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Polis of the SoHo Integrative Health Center has her own
perspective on this. She has long been teased by her brother, a
surgeon, over her specialty, but now he is jealous. ``When I first
went into dermatology in 1983,'' Dr. Polis said, ``my brother said,
`Congratulations! You're a dermatologist. If it's wet, dry it. If
it's dry, wet it.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, he calls me on the phone after an eight-hour operation on
a kidney,'' she continued, ``for which his local managed-care plan
has slashed their price for the sixth time and pays him $500, 85
percent of which is eaten up by office costs and malpractice
insurance. And he says to me, `Do I wish I was a cosmetic
dermatologist now!'''

BUILDING A CAREER IN CONSTRUCTION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Deciding on a career is part research and part
happenstance. It's always a good idea to do what interests you, but
it's also important to investigate the long-term demand for an
occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Though most jobs for young men and women entering the work force
in Houston can be considered safe bets for the long term, the
construction trades _ in light of some recent bad news _ might be a
cause of concern for the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   A University of Houston economist predicted earlier this week
that the local apartment market is reaching the point of oversupply
that will force rents down.
</P>
<P>
   That, coupled with a falloff in new commercial and office
building as well as higher interest rates nationwide, which are
beginning to choke housing starts, led Barton Smith, director of
UH's Institute for Regional Forecasting, to predict Houston will
lose between 2,000 and 3,000 construction jobs next year.
</P>
<P>
   Though that sounds like a lot, the predicted loss in jobs comes
on top of a rip-roaring year in which Houston contractors added
7,700 construction jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, is construction really a good career with a lot of
long-term potential?
</P>
<P>
   Educators, construction companies and union leaders contend
construction is still a good choice in part because of demographic
changes, growth in the industrial sector and the unusual
construction-related opportunities that have popped up.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
RESUPPLYING THE WORK FORCE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Demand for construction workers is strong because the current
crop is getting older, said Richard Shaw, secretary-treasurer of
the Harris County AFL-CIO in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw estimates the average craft worker is 50.
</P>
<P>
   Even with fewer jobs available, there still aren't enough people
to replace the ones who are leaving, said Larry Williams, director
of human resources for Marek Family of Companies.
</P>
<P>
   Construction workers tend to become supervisors as they get
older or join Home Depot as instructors, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see many 60-year-old concrete finishers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That aging population will continue to open up a lot of jobs at
a time when the construction industry has been especially
short-staffed.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, young men went into construction because that's
what their fathers did. But that pattern changed in the 1980s when
the industry went through a severe slump and thousands of workers
who had planned on a steady job for life ended up on the
unemployment line.
</P>
<P>
   Fathers told their kids not to go into construction, Shaw said,
so a whole generation of workers wasn't trained.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the cyclical nature of the business still concerns
students, who ask if the boom will last.
</P>
<P>
   But signs are on the horizon that industrial demand is on the
upswing, said Dickie Jones, manager of craft development and
training for Fluor Signature Services in nearby La Porte.
</P>
<P>
   With the deregulation of electric power, several companies are
building power plants in Texas and around the United States, Jones
said.
</P>
<P>
   And the efforts to improve air quality in Texas will also employ
a lot of welders, pipe fitters and electricians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have jobs now that we can't fill,'' said Jones, who added
that he would continue to recommend construction as a well-paying,
solid profession.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
LOW ON CAREER STATUS LADDER &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The news about fewer construction jobs comes at a time when the
industry is facing an image problem. Young folks are more
interested in computer-related careers than slinging hammers in hot
weather.
</P>
<P>
   Williams likes to quote a study of high school students who
rated the desirability of 250 careers. Construction came in 248th,
just before migrant farm workers and commercial fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   There's so much demand for construction workers that many
construction companies have been lowering their standards.
</P>
<P>
   Williams speculated that if a survey was taken of good-size
contractors, all of them would love to replace 25 percent of their
employees. But there is so much work that contractors will hire
folks with erratic work histories or those lacking in job skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We joke that if you can fog up a mirror, you have a job,''
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he welcomes a tighter construction market next year.
That way, construction companies won't have to hire the workers who
don't show up regularly or have problems at the work site.

LATEST LURE ON THE WEB: FREE TRADES  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 14)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., N.Y.)  (af) 
 By PATRICK McGEEHAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The price war among online brokerage firms has escalated so
rapidly that the stock trade has gone from being a commodity to a
come-on.
</P>
<P>
   As commissions for executing stock trades sank lower and lower,
Wall Street experts said it was only a matter of time before
somebody started giving away trades. Well, that time has come: the
American Express Co. on Monday begun promoting an online brokerage
service with commission-free stock purchases for anybody who
deposits $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   That offer, which American Express officials say is not
temporary, has caused a lot of head-shaking in an industry that
already abounds in gimmickry. To entice investors, online brokers
are tossing in everything from trips to Hawaii to $100 bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting very messy,'' said Stephen D. McDonald, chief
executive of TD Waterhouse Group, an online brokerage firm that
charges $12 for some trades. ``Next thing you know, we'll be giving
away toasters.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no small appliances on the immediate horizon. But the
firms have started so many giveaways that even their executives
have trouble keeping track of what is being dangled before
investors' eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, DLJdirect, the online brokerage arm of investment
bank Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, was using ads on financial Web
sites, making two offers simultaneously to new account holders:
investors who knew where to look could choose to accept a credit of
$100 or six months of free Internet access, which would be paid in
the form of a $120 credit.
</P>
<P>
   ETrade Group went a little further this month when it started
offering $150 to customers of a competitor, the Discover Brokerage
Direct unit of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, for switching to ETrade.
That was double the offers of $75 that ETrade and Discover had made
for opening accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Ameritrade, an Omaha-based firm that charges $8 for some trades,
is trumpeting an offer that may be worth more than those that
ETrade and DLJdirect have on the table. In exchange for opening a
new account, customers can get two round-trip plane tickets to
London, Mexico or Hawaii. The catch is that the tickets are free
only after a customer pays for a nondiscounted, seven-night stay at
certain hotels.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of crazy things going on in terms of marketing
and account acquisition,'' said James Marks, an analyst at Credit
Suisse First Boston. Online brokerages are spending so much money
on advertising and promotion for very similar services, he said,
that they find themselves ``in a position like American Express
where you have to come up with almost a gimmick that isn't
sustainable.''
</P>
<P>
   Marks recently turned cautious on the stocks of some online
brokers, including Ameritrade and ETrade. Although he was an early
proponent of heavy marketing spending, he now fears that some
online brokers are spending far too much to acquire new accounts.
</P>
<P>
   This summer's slowdown in online account activity, he said,
raised doubts about whether the online brokers could continue their
growth pace. Shares of some of them, which ran up sharply in the
first half of the year, are now about 50 percent off their highs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The accounts that these guys really want are the investors
that will take out margin loans,'' or borrow to buy stocks, Marks
said. But advertising low-margin interest rates does not attract
customers the way free trades or other promotions do, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As cluttered as the landscape has become, American Express
managed to steal the spotlight, if only briefly, by creating a new
business model for the brokerage industry. While some of the
biggest Wall Street firms are struggling to shift from
commission-based models to fee-based models, American Express has
decided to charge neither commissions nor fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought that this is kind of an interesting way we can
differentiate ourselves,'' said Ruediger Adolf, a senior vice
president at American Express. While Adolf prefers not to describe
the free stock trades as a loss leader, American Express is giving
away a service that costs it at least several dollars to provide.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald estimates that it costs the biggest and most efficient
brokerage firms at least $8 to carry out a stock trade ordered
electronically. The cost for firms that have to pay others to
execute and process their trades could run as high as $25, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make money in other ways,'' Adolf said, referring to the
interest that American Express earns on the cash in customers'
accounts and on loans that customers take to buy stocks. ``With
traditional brokers, this would be a very, very dangerous game
because you fundamentally are cannibalizing your main business.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, American Express has nothing to lose by giving
away trades _ except money. Adolf declined to say how much American
Express expected to lose on the commission-free trades, but on the
whole, he said, ``we think we absolutely can make money in this
business.''
</P>
<P>
   The company is not making all stock trades free. Customers with
at least $100,000 in their accounts pay no commissions, but those
with less than $25,000 in their accounts pay $14.95 a trade. For
the people in between, American Express came up with an interesting
twist: they can buy stocks without paying a commission, but must
pay $14.95 each time they sell shares of a company.
</P>
<P>
   That move, unusual for a brokerage, comes directly out of the
mutual fund playbook. Many fund companies let investors buy fund
shares without a sales charge, but charge one when the shares are
sold.
</P>
<P>
   A key component of the plan: Adolf said American Express did not
want to attract the type of investor for whom free trades would be
most appealing _ the hyperactive trader. What could sound better to
somebody who spends his days buying and selling stocks than an
account that charges no fee and no trading commissions?
</P>
<P>
   Instead, American Express, like some other financial services
firms offering low-priced trades, preaches long-term investing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not subscribe to very aggressive trading strategies,
particularly day-trading,'' Adolf said.
</P>
<P>
   To head off a rush of day traders, American Express has put in a
speed bump: Even those customers with $100,000 will have to pay
$14.95 to sell a stock the same day they bought it.

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: blood into an anemic patient.
</P>
<P>
   Look at a crossover artist like electric guitarist Steve Mackey,
for instance. He started playing as a teenager in a garage band,
then studied with mainstream academic composers such as Donald
Martino, Andrew Imbrie and John Harbison. He now teaches
composition at Princeton University and writes for musicians as
varied as guitarist Bill Frisell and the Kronos Quartet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It uses elements of rock music,'' Mackey says of his work. ``I
like its rhythm and energy, and I like the sound of the electric
guitar. ... My music couldn't be written by someone who wasn't
seriously invested in both worlds (classical and rock). I'm not
making a conscious effort to mix these things up. I'm just mixed
up,'' he adds cheerfully.
</P>
<P>
   Side by side with this flood of new material runs the track of
technology. In the years since Thomas Edison invented the
gramophone, the reproduction of music has gotten ever more crisp
and easy to employ. Each advance _ from 78 rpm records to 33 1/3
rpm long-playing records, from monaural to stereophonic sound, from
vinyl discs to compact discs, from the patch cords and circuitry of
early synthesizers to the complex computer-controlled functions of
today's recording studios _ has its adherents and its detractors.
</P>
<P>
   But the pluses and minuses of every new technology pale beside
the achievement of making music more accessible to more people at
lower cost, and introducing them to forms, styles, colors and
textures that 30 years ago might have been available only on
ethnographic recordings made by cultural anthropologists for the
Smithsonian Institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never have so many people known so many different kinds of
music,'' says the composer Peter Schickele, host of an eclectic
radio show called ``Schickele Mix'' that opens each week with Duke
Ellington's motto: ``If it sounds good, it is good.''
</P>
<P>
   Schickele continues: ``You can hear music literally from all
over the world, from any time period, and you can hear performances
that are as authentic as possible. ... No classical musician today
could graduate without a knowledge of Bach _ yet Bach could not
have known the music of a composer two centuries before him.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology has made for dire prognostications from music
professionals, about half-empty concert halls and people who will
never know the pleasures of live music. But the rise and fall, or
fall and rise, of one kind of classical music over another give the
lie to these Cassandras.
</P>
<P>
   The wide range of music made available by new technologies has
given composers _ and performers adventurous enough to explore new
paths _ an unprecedented array of raw material, of new techniques
and of combinations and collaborations unknown to musicians of
several decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the only composer to make use of music I've never
heard live,'' says Schickele. And William Bolcom, who has had two
operas produced by Lyric Opera of Chicago, including the recent ``A
View From the Bridge,'' is delighted to proclaim his musical roots:
``I've always had an interest in jazz tunes and popular songs. I
worked my way through college as a dance band pianist, playing
everywhere from burlesque halls to stag parties to churches. Why is
this music necessarily less good? I've finally become shameless
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Crossover also means popularization, which causes some musical
purists to shudder at such high culture icons playing around in the
barnyard of low culture _ and making money at it! _ as Kiri Te
Kanawa with Gershwin songs, Itzhak Perlman playing with a klezmer
band, Placido Domingo and Renee Fleming's schmaltzy CD of romantic
duets, James Galway's ``Annie's Song'' and, of course, the Three
Tenors. But Mario Lanza did the same thing 50 years ago, using a
magnificent tenor voice and good looks for a series of Hollywood
operetta films; and Metropolitan Opera singer Richard Tucker, the
son of a cantor, was happy to raise money for Jewish causes with
recordings of Yiddish songs.
</P>
<P>
   A group like the Kronos Quartet, which specializes in
20th-century music, illustrates the richness of its possibilities.
They've played everything from the Shostakovich and Bartok quartet
cycles to the mordant rock of Jimi Hendrix's ``Purple Haze.''
There's nothing they haven't tried, it seems, but no one worries
that they'll run out of ideas.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the line separating classical from popular music
has gotten more blurred throughout the 20th century. Henry
Pleasants was right to note that straight, humorless, conventional
composers, less interested in making listenable music than in
proving the superiority of their ism over yesterday's ism, have
become irrelevant _ at least to the concertgoer. But classical
music that takes delight in the cornucopia of popular music styles
pulls audiences right into its arms.
</P>
<P>
   Though often presumed dead, music rich enough for the concert
hall is very much alive. And it got a great new lease on life at
the turn of the crossover century.

 &HT;    Crossover creates a world of potential
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Nov. 14.

<TEXT>
<P>
   All through its history, classical music has gone through one
crisis after another. For an art created to give pleasure and
restore the spirit, it has been interrupted time and again by
discord.
</P>
<P>
   From organum, the
</P>
<P>
   choral style in the Middle Ages, to minimalism in the 1980s, as
each form has become the accepted norm, it has found opposition
ready and waiting. When Bach wrote his late masterpieces, baroque
music was almost passe; his sons, Johann Christian and Carl Philipp
Emanuel, helped popularize the new rococo style that flowered in
the works of Haydn and Mozart. Brahms fought the ghost of Beethoven
all his life and achieved a self-sufficient artistic maturity in
his 50s _ by which time the followers of Richard Wagner were
writing polemics against what they viewed as his stuffy
conservative symphonies. Sometimes it seems as though the monks had
no sooner written down the chants approved by Pope Gregory I than
some other monks charged out of a nearby monastery to save music
from the reactionaries.
</P>
<P>
   In the 20th century, where everything moves much faster than in
the past, classical music has been through a decade-by-decade
series of movements and reactions against those movements.
</P>
<P>
   As the 19th century came to a close, composers _ much like
visual artists in their discipline _ loudly wondered if the art
form had not run itself into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   When Wagner proclaimed that his was ``the music of the future,''
he threw down the gauntlet not only to Brahms but to the entire
musical establishment, challenging them to prove that the standard
symphony and opera were not all played out. At the same time, the
anti-Wagnerians believed Wagner and his acolytes were sending
classical music and serious opera straight to hell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twentieth-century music throughout the world suffered enormous
shocks,'' says former New York Times music critic John Rockwell in
a pivotal book called ``All American Music'' (1983). ``Traditions
(were) disrupted and deflected, assumptions confounded, crises
proclaimed.''
</P>
<P>
   So, just as the visual arts began to explore how the eye saw and
came up with cubism and abstraction, composers began to experiment
with how the ear heard. They were not so much interested in pretty
sound, passively accepted, as in getting the audience to listen
actively and intelligently. And what they got, all too often, was
rejection.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Pleasants, like Rockwell one of a small number of music
critics to consider classical and popular music on equal terms,
says that avant-garde composers' ``excessive complexity and
dissonance and their resultant loss of audience have condemned them
to irrelevance. The true music of our time, one that expresses its
spirit and sensibility, is popular.''
</P>
<P>
   Go back to the supersaturated romantic harmonies of Wagner. In
the new century, post-Wagnerian composers pushed harmony to the
edge, so it no longer led the ear to the home key, in the way of
the clean harmonic patterns of a Mozart symphony. This was called
``atonality,'' a term that frightens today's audiences. But, as
practiced by Arnold Schoenberg and his circle, as well as by Igor
Stravinsky in ``The Rite of Spring,'' atonality does not mean
strident dissonance; it means harmonies that do not resolve in
standard or predictable ways _ indeed, often do not resolve at all.
</P>
<P>
   As with most religions proclaimed by zealots, atonality did not
last long in its pure form. It was superseded by the 12-tone
system, also called serialism, which was based on the equality of
the dozen notes of the chromatic scale (the black and white keys in
any octave of the piano), so that no note could be said to be the
magnetic center of harmony. And within a few short years, serialism
gave way to neoclassicism, in which composers wrote in classic
forms for small, stripped-down ensembles. Stravinsky's chamber
cantata ``L'Histoire du Soldat'' and Prokofiev's ``Classical
Symphony'' spoke to the precarious economics of postwar Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction _ positive and negative _ also occurred in opera.
Romantic operas gave way to naturalistic operas, influenced by
Freud's theories of sexual identity (``Jenufa'' and ``Der
Rosenkavalier,'' despite their great differences, were shaped by
Freudian thought) and new sociological ideas, born during the
Industrial Revolution, of man's place in an indifferent world
(Alban Berg's ``Wozzeck'').
</P>
<P>
   In the Jazz Age, naturalistic opera was elbowed aside by cabaret
opera: works such as Brecht and Weill's ``The Threepenny Opera,''
which poured vinegar on the political and social sores of the day.
After World War II, naturalistic opera came back in works such as
``Peter Grimes'' (1945). By the end of the century, no style
predominated. The late century has seen everything from fantasy
opera (``The Ghosts of Versailles'') to docu-opera (``Nixon in
China''). One of the last works of the '90s, ``The Dangerous
Liaisons,'' took audiences straight back to the land of ``Don
Giovanni'' _ as seen through a bleak postmodern scrim.
</P>
<P>
   Atonality or serialism, naturalism or surrealism, no movement
lasted long enough to produce more than a couple of textbook works
before giving way to the next. Twentieth-century music obeys
Newton's third law of motion: Every action has an equal and
opposite reaction.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not a fair statement. What really has happened is
that composers have assimilated whatever is useful to them _
atonality or metric modulation or ``musique concrete'' or
indeterminism or minimalism or any of the other -isms _ in order to
re-create them in their own image. The average audience member who
won't come near Schoenberg's 12-tone ``Kammersymphonie'' might be
surprised to learn that Leonard Bernstein used a 12-tone row as the
melodic line in the ``Quiet!'' trio of the musical ``Candide.'' On
Broadway, the tone-row sounded neither academic nor fearsome _
perhaps because the composer didn't call attention to it with a
neon sign that shrieked: ``This is modern music.'' But it is.
</P>
<P>
   More important than the profusion of -isms that flowered and
wilted overnight throughout the century is the mutual cannibalism
of popular and classical music that has been called different
things at different times but is today called ``crossover.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No culture in the world has a richer confluence of these
cross-currents than the United States, where the old battles about
what is European and what is American, what is popular and what is
`serious,' are being fought with a new fierceness _ and resolved
with a new confidence,'' says Rockwell.
</P>
<P>
   Composers have always borrowed material, from the dozens of
medieval Masses based on the French popular song ``L'homme arme''
(``The armed man'' or ``The soldier'') to Bach's organ chorales
based on Lutheran hymns to the Russian folk songs that Beethoven
incorporated into his string quartets for the music-loving Russian
ambassador to the Viennese court, Count Razumovsky.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 20th century, in addition to hymns and folk tunes,
composers fell in love with jazz and with world music. Stravinsky
heard a piano rag in Paris and wrote a ragtime dance into
``L'Histoire du Soldat''; the violin in a sonata by Maurice Ravel
slithers and slides through a blues tune. Philip Glass' minimalism
_ the use of repeated chords and melodic patterns to create a
musical tapestry _ in the score to the 1983 film ``Koyaanis-
</P>
<P>
   qatsi'' comes directly from his studies with Indian sitarist
Ravi Shankar. Indian raga is based on the same principle of small
elements repeated and endlessly varied.
</P>
<P>
   There's a difference, however, of attitude. Composers of
previous eras tended to quote ``low culture'' materials to show how
cleverly they could dress them up in ``high culture'' clothes.
</P>
<P>
   In the 20th century, there is much more respect for the
nonclassical material and a sense that its freshness _ rhythmic,
melodic or harmonic _ enriches everyone's musical experience.
Gershwin's ``Rhapsody in Blue'' is filled with the syncopated
rhythms and slinky sonorities of jazz, not because the composer was
desperate for a new idea but because he heard that the mix of jazz
and classical sound was greater than the sum of its parts. His
``Porgy and Bess'' doesn't patronize African-American work songs
(``It Take a Long Pull to Get There'') or vaudeville routines (``It
Ain't Necessarily So'') or the blues (``My Man's Gone Now''). It
glories in offering up their undiscovered beauties to a new
audience.
</P>
<P>
   For another approach, consider Charles Ives, the independent
American composer who was the son of a Civil War bandmaster. You
can hear the patriotic tunes his father's band played in many of
his works. But Ives does more than quote. He alters and adapts and
fragments the familiar until the listener learns to find it in all
its infinite variety. Or he uses it to illustrate a really complex
idea: the spatial sound effect of a band marching through town _
the crescendo of its approach, the full voice of its stop in front
of the reviewing stand, the decrescendo of its departure.
</P>
<P>
   Many a politically correct academic, soul-searching the moral
question of one culture co-opting another, will downgrade the
merger by calling it ``appropriation.'' What the professor means is
that the absorption of jazz elements or world music instruments or
folk songs is exploitation, pure and simple.
</P>
<P>
   But the composers who use this material couldn't be more
respectful, whether it's Bela Bartok integrating the off-kilter
tunes and rhythms of Carpathian Mountain villagers in his piano
method, ``Mikrokosmos''; or hammered dulcimer player Malcolm
Dalglish writing songs for children that imitate the shimmering
sounds of Bulgarian women's choirs; or Hughes de Courson fusing the
music of Bach with African choral colors and rhythmic underpinnings
in ``Lambarena.''
</P>
<P>
   What crossover has done, in the simplest possible terms, is
reopen the possibilities of classical music, which less than a
hundred years ago was considered moribund and done for. The
expressive possibilities of what was once considered peripheral
music have been like a transfusion of fresh blood into an anemic
patient.

 &HT;    CLINTON SE EUROPE TOUR TO HIGHLIGHT STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE OF
TROUBLED REGION
 &HT;    (800&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    EDs: With vital stats on Greece, Turkey, Italy and Bulgaria
attached to end of story.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With scheduled stops in Istanbul, Athens and
Florence, the 10-day swing through southeastern Europe that
President Bill Clinton begins on Sunday might well be dismissed as
a rugs, ruins and renaissance tour.
</P>
<P>
   There will be sightseeing and shop ops built in, to be sure.
</P>
<P>
   There's a serious purpose, though, behind a journey that takes
Clinton first to Turkey, for a two-day state visit in Ankara,
followed by a summit in Istanbul with his counterparts from 53
other countries that belong to the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   From there Clinton continues on to Greece, Italy, Bulgaria and
Kosovo, where he'll have a pre-Thanksgiving dinner with U.S. troops
making up part of the NATO force working to hold together one of
Clinton's most ambitious foreign policy gambits: a fractious
Balkans peace.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the issue is combatting terrorism or promoting
democracy, preventing the spread of Balkans-like conflict or
expanding trade opportunities, extending NATO's reach into the
Caucuses or securing access to the riches of Caspian oil, Europe's
soft Aegean underbelly has become the inescapable intersection of a
widening range of U.S. interests.
</P>
<P>
   Much is riding on how it all turns out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Southeastern Europe remains the Achilles heel of Europe,''
explained Charles Kupchan, director of Europe studies with the
Council on Foreign Relations. ``If you want to eventually think
about a Europe that is self-confident, one that is enlarging, then
you really need to crack the problems of Southeastern Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   The troubles range from ethnic conflict in the Balkans and the
Caucasus region of the former Soviet Union to the enduring
animosity between Greece and Turkey, symbolized by their 30-year
stand-off over the island nation of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, much of
southeastern Europe has been left behind in the continent's broader
race toward market-opening and democratic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the region is impoverished _ Bulgaria's 8.2 million
people scrape by on the annual equivalent of just US$1,500 per
person _ and, technologically, several generations behind its
neighbors to the north and west.
</P>
<P>
   And, a decade after the end of the Cold War, the people of
southeastern Europe reside still in the shadow of uncertainty cast
by the economic and social collapse in Russia, in a disturbing
counterpoint to the gains made across most of central Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The part of Europe where wars do not happen, where democracy
is secure, where markets are open and where nations share
responsibilities, is now larger than at any point in history,''
White House National Security Adviser Samuel Berger told reporters
Friday. ``Dealing with this unfinished business and strengthening
our ties with key allies will be the president's top priorities
next week, and is a large part of America's agenda in the coming
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Healing regional divisions that are, in some cases, rooted in
antiquity isn't the sort of thing that happens just because Air
Force One drops into a region for a week or so.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is aiming, though, for some tangible results.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes to get Greece and Turkey to agree to enter into formal
talks, under the auspices of the United Nations, over the future of
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a problem that can be solved,'' Clinton said Monday in
a speech at Georgetown University. ``Eventually, it will be solved.
And I intend to see that the United States does everything we
possibly can to be of help.''
</P>
<P>
   He also expects to lend his blessing to a broader regional
agreement to support a commercial pipeline that would link Turkey's
southern riverport of Ceyhan to the vast Caspian Sea oilfields
1,100 miles to the east.
</P>
<P>
   He'll visit the epicenter of last summer's earthquakes in
Turkey, this week rocked again by killer tremors, highlighting the
U.S. military and humanitarian aid he ordered in response.
</P>
<P>
   And he'll do what he can to try to win Greece back to the full
fold of NATO in the wake of the 11-week alliance air campaign
against Serb-dominated Yugoslavia last spring, an attack that more
than nine Greeks out of 10 opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was forced to delay his visit to Greece, originally
scheduled for Nov. 13-15, after anti-American demonstrations rocked
Athens and raised security concerns. Aides expect protests when he
visits Nov. 19-20, but Clinton hopes to hold out any demonstrations
as an example of tolerance of the sort of freedom of expression he
would like to see take hold elsewhere across the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to speak about the vital role Greece is playing and
can play in Europe,'' Clinton said. ``The world's oldest democracy
is a model to the younger democracies of the Balkans, a gateway to
their markets, a force for stability in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional add.)
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of Clinton's trip, though, is Turkey, the
ancient crossroads of Europe, the Mideast, Central Asia and Islam,
and the modern nexis where American allies brush up against U.S.
foes.
</P>
<P>
   A primarily Islamic country self-described as a secular
democratic republic, Turkey has borders touching Russia, the former
Soviet states of Georgia and Armenia, as well as Syria, Iraq and
Iran.
</P>
<P>
   That makes Turkey, a NATO member that has been the staging
ground for nearly a decade of U.S. combat air missions directed
against Iraq, a unique Western ally on the front lines of global
efforts to combat an explosive mix of terrorism and Islamic
fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the coming century will be shaped in good measure by
the way in which Turkey itself defines its future and its role
today and tomorrow,'' Clinton said in his Georgetown University
speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future can be shaped for the better if Turkey can become
fully a part of Europe, as a stable, democratic, secular, Islamic
nation,'' said Clinton, ``and if there is a real vision on the part
of our European allies, who must be willing to reach out and to
believe that it is at Turkey where Europe and the Muslim world can
meet in peace and harmony.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has spent much of his administration goading his
European counterparts to invite Turkey into the continent's formal
economic and political club: the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Largely at his urging, the EU is expected to give Turkey a road
map next month pointing the way toward membership sometime over the
coming decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It now has a ticket to Europe,'' said Kupchan. ``It represents
a softening of what was really nothing short of a racial prejudice
which said that Europe is Christian and Turkey is Moslem and
therefore Turkey is not Europe.''

 &HT;    Technological innovations may grow audiences whatever format art
takes
 &HT;    By Judith Green
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once upon a time, there were live recordings. If Vladimir
Horowitz made a mistake, he could play the whole piece over or
leave the dropped notes there on the floor. There were no other
choices.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon another time, record producers and tape editors went
into a soundproof booth with a razor blade, sharpened to
microsurgical accuracy, and cut out musical errors, patching them
with the right notes played by the musician _ or some other
musician _ on another occasion.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to Allgood Productions, a busy Atlanta recording studio,
is an eye _ as well as an ear _ opener. William Allgood, the owner
and producer, can show you the amazing fixes he can make with a
bank of computerized sound equipment. Matching the sound of a piano
trio or a brass band with equal ease, he can replace sour notes
without any live musician anywhere in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the CD-buying public gets used to perfect
performances and then, says the conventional wisdom, can't forgive
mistakes in a live recital or concert. So CDs are among the many
reasons concert promoters worry about the demise of live music.
</P>
<P>
   Bulletins about the death of classical music have been issued
with great regularity since the start of the 20th century, and
technology is often blamed. The gramophone was going to kill it. So
was radio. So were long-playing records. Instead, these helped grow
new audiences.
</P>
<P>
   But the technology alarmists still persist. So do the
youth-culture finger shakers. Years ago, the first national arts
demographic studies caused orchestra administrators to reach for
the migraine medicine with the news that the average concertgoer
was 55. ``The graying of the audience,'' they wailed. But, as
National Public Radio music commentator Miles Hoffman notes,
symphony audiences today are still, on average, 55. It's clear that
new audiences push from underneath to join the symphony crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Opera, thought a decade ago to be on its deathbed, is the hot
ticket of the '90s, thanks to supertitles that finally admit the
audience to previously untranslated jokes and threats, curses and
foreplay. Chamber music, once an elite medium, is intimate enough
to be inexpensive, which attracts younger listeners. Today,
inexpensive CD technology brings us a riotous profusion of world
music.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a canon of accepted great pieces anymore,'' says
composer and radio host Peter Schickele, who preaches the value of
eclectic listening on his show ``Schickele Mix.'' ``There's a lot
of music today that you can't tell whether (the composer) grew up
in classical or pop music. Name a warhorse from the second half of
this century. There aren't any, except maybe the `Adagio for
Strings.'''
</P>
<P>
   The feistiness of late 20th-century music, which draws from many
influences and vocabularies, is its strength, Schickele says. Its
weakness is the same as that of any other pop culture genre. ``For
something to be making enough money to do fine is not good enough
if it could be making more. This leads away from diversity and
toward sameness.'' Classical music goes on, despite the dire
predictions of critics and the pandering to popularity of arts
marketers. Earlier this season, the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra
thought about placing oversize video screens in Symphony Hall to
give the audience close-ups of the players. As with the super-
</P>
<P>
   titles, there would be those who love the idea and those who
hate it. But, as with the supertitles, no one has to look, and the
video innovation may attract new audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Classical music in the next century may not be recorded or
presented in a format that's familiar and comfortable. This is as
it should be. It's a living art.

<P>
   Coincidence: Ives' Symphony No. 4, which requires two orchestras

   Capitalizing on the thoughts of Austrian composer Josef Matthias

   The Nazis come to power in Germany, leading to an exodus of

   1934
</P>
<P>
   ``Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District'' (``Katerina

   In the Symphony No. 5, his

   Symphony No. 7 (Shostakovich), written during the siege of
Leningrad, is smuggled out of Russia and used as a propaganda tool
to raise money for America's Soviet allies. Bartok, in the
hospital, heard its ``Nazi bolero'' theme, the long crescendo that
symbolizes the German march into Russia, and makes fun of it in
``Concerto for Orchestra'' (1943).

<P>
   ``4'33,'''' a piece by John Cage, features a pianist who comes
onstage, sits at the piano for four minutes and 33 seconds, then
exits without having played a note. The music is provided

 &HT;    Shabby treatment unworthy of a `King'
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's happened to ``King of the Hill'' is not a pretty sight.
Fox has jerked it around like a bad dog on a short chain, and it's
a miracle anybody is still watching.
</P>
<P>
   Two seasons ago, when it was on after ``The Simpsons,'' ``King''
ruled the ratings. Then Fox moved it to Tuesday nights, where its
Nielsens fell off a cliff. Fox moved the bloodied but still proud
cartoon back to Sundays, only before ``The Simpsons'' at 7:30, so
now it regularly gets bumped by Fox football. And if it somehow
survives all that, it's still a fairly subtle little show that most
kids don't appreciate but is on when a lot of adults aren't
watching.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder its ratings have fallen about 50 percent. Still, it
works and people watch, which at Fox these days is cause for
celebration, so disastrous has been its fall season.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night is typical ``Hill,'' if any show that has guest
stars Meryl Streep and the Dixie Chicks can be considered typical
in any way. Hank wins a trip to New Orleans to toss a football at
halftime of a football game and (maybe, yeah right) win $1 million.
He takes along his beer-guzzling buddies, and they stop off at
Bill's old ancestral home on the bayou, ruled by Cajun-fried Aunt
Esme (Streep) and home to three lubricious, hard-drawlin'
cousins-in-law (the Chicks).
</P>
<P>
   ``There are strings on our hearts that need to be strummed,''
says Esme to the rather overwhelmed visiting males, and the whole
thing plays like Tennessee Williams parodying himself. (The episode
is titled ``A Beer Can Named Desire.'')
</P>
<P>
   It's clever and may make you chuckle with appreciation, but
doesn't really feel like what folks are going to want to watch at
7:30 on Fox. The Chicks don't even sing or parody their own image _
again, probably not a crowd-pleasing idea.
</P>
<P>
   There's still plenty of spark left in Hank Hill and the gang,
but given their home these days, they need more of a major
jump-start.
</P>
<P>
   ``King of the Hill''
</P>
<P>
   7:30 p.m. Sunday on Fox.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The carefree, pluralistic spirit of the 1960s didn't
die; it possessed the body of Ellie Covan. As executive director of
Dixon Place, a performance space she founded in 1986, Ms. Covan
provides a venue where choreographers, actors, writers, performance
artists and musicians can present works in progress. Critics are
not invited.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Dixon Place presented some 400 performances, more
than half of them by nonwhites. ``Diversity is important to me,''
said Ms. Covan, who is 42. ``It's not that I have a quota, but New
York is not a white city.'' Every Sunday and Monday in November,
for instance, Dixon Place is presenting ``Notes of a Negro
Neurotic,'' written and performed by Nancy Giles. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The original Dixon Place was situated in Ms. Covan's storefront
apartment in Manhattan. For the last seven years, it has been
housed in the living room of Ms. Covan's loft on the Bowery. In
September, she finally moved the operations into a legitimate
70-seat theater, the former Vineyard Theater in Manhattan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With its new home have come amenities. For the first time, Ms.
Covan, who wears her hair in ringlets and looks like the comic
Sandra Bernhard's kid sister, doesn't have to share her bathroom
with the performers. There's also a computerized lighting board to
replace the old homemade lighting system built by her father with
rheostat dimmers.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But costs have also increased. Ms. Covan has had to hire a
part-time technical director, for instance. She expects her budget
to grow from $180,000 to $240,000. To help raise money, she has put
together an executive committee to act as ambassadors for Dixon
Place.
</P>
<P>
   Included on it are the choreographer Ann Carlson, the actress
Kathleen Chalfant, the playwright Craig Lucas, and Jim Nicola,
David White and Mark Russell, the executive directors,
respectively, of New York Theater Workshop, Dance Theater Workshop
and Performance Space 122. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `'We're not trying to establish ourselves and compete for the
same money these other venues are,'' said Ms. Covan, referring to
her colleagues Nicola, White and Russell. ``We've proven that we
have viability and longevity and serve an important purpose.
Unfortunately, you can't get institutional support unless you own
your own building or have a very long lease.'' Ms. Covan's lease is
for one year.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What hasn't changed is Dixon Place's funky aesthetic. It remains
a playground for starry-eyed wannabes and a refuge for the already
established. Dixon Place alumni like the monologist John Leguizamo,
the lesbian comic Reno and the performance artists David Cale and
Karen Finley return there regularly to try out new material.
</P>
<P>
   Audiences sit on a mixture of traditional chairs and discarded
sofas. Tickets prices range from nothing to $12, depending on the
event, and all performers are paid a modest fee. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Covan, a native of Corpus Christi, Texas, came to New York
to pursue a stage career after receiving a BFA in acting from the
University of Texas. Disillusioned, she fled to Paris, where she
stayed in the apartment of an American businessman named Daniel
Dixon. By accident, people started showing up Tuesday evenings for
informal readings of their work. The concept of Dixon Place was
born. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Evenings devoted to young writers remain an important component
in the programming mix. Ms. Covan does most of the selecting, but
not all. Eight curators are responsible for one evening each month.
</P>
<P>
   The choreographer Yoshiko Chuma, for instance, has put together
a series of dance evenings for midcareer choreographers who have
been asked to create works using the space limitations of Dixon
Place. Another dance series, ``Under Exposed,'' organized by
Christine Doempke, is devoted to untested choreographers. One night
each month is an open-mike event, where the first 10 people who
sign up can perform for 10 minutes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Covan won't single out a favorite artist. ``I'm always
looking for something different or unusual,'' she said. ``Something
I haven't seen a thousand times.''

SOMETIMES, AN OUTSIDE DIRECTOR IS COMFORTABLE IN THE CHIEF'S
CHAIR  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 14)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Pa., Calif., N.Y.)  (af) 
 By VERNE G. KOPYTOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The board of Thermo Electron Corp., the scientific, medical and
industrial instrument maker based in Waltham, Mass., did not look
far when it hired a new president and chief executive last spring.
He was one of its own: Richard F. Syron, a Thermo Electron director
since 1997 and the president of the American Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   A company's board might seem a natural pool of talent from which
to draw a leader. After setting aside a couple of seats for
insiders, most companies fill out their boards with experienced
executives from other industries who can offer valuable advice and
look out for the interests of shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   After a few years on the board, good directors become intimately
familiar with the company's affairs and know its strengths,
weaknesses and competitive challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Yet such selections are rare. ``Hiring an executive from the
board is not a practice that is embraced by every company,'' said
Dennis Carey, vice chairman of Spencer Stuart Executive Search
Consultants in Philadelphia, who has studied executive succession
at large companies for a book to be published next year.
</P>
<P>
   While companies often turn to outside directors as useful,
temporary fill-ins, experts say, they are deterred from considering
them to fill top executive posts like chief executive, president or
chief financial officer for the long term. Difficulties like timing
and availability, potential conflicts of interest and corporate
cultures tilt strongly in favor of internal succession or of
searching for someone truly on the outside.
</P>
<P>
   Notable exceptions include Randall L. Tobias, who became chief
executive of Eli Lilly, the pharmaceutical company, in 1993 after
serving as a Lilly director while he was chief executive of the
international division of AT&AMP;T. And in 1987, Alcoa chose one of its
directors, Paul H. O'Neill, who was then the president of
International Paper, as its chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their success, and what Carey described as a generally
favorable track record for other companies who hired from their
boards, few large companies turn to anyone beyond their own
executive ranks, let alone an outside director. Almost 9 out of 10
chief executives of Fortune 100 companies were promoted to the job
from within the company, Carey said.
</P>
<P>
   In most those cases, the successor had been specifically groomed
for the job _ an approach that almost always rules out directors,
to avoid creating an awkward situation for the current chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want a CEO anxious about who on the board wants to
take his job,'' said James Kristie, editor of Directors and Boards,
a quarterly journal that covers corporate boards.
</P>
<P>
   A director designated ahead of time as a future executive is
also put in an awkward position, one that might give shareholders
misgivings: when the interests of management and shareholders
differ, on which side is an outside director who will soon be
inside?
</P>
<P>
   Because of these difficulties, when directors are considered at
all, it is generally when the company has allowed itself to be
taken by surprise and , has no successor who is ready for the job.
Roger Raber, president and chief executive of the National
Association of Corporate Directors, said that in his mind, a
company that hires one of its directors as an executive has
probably planned poorly.
</P>
<P>
   ``When organizations dip into the board, I scratch my head,''
Raber said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a company finds the notion of hiring a director
attractive, its board may not include anyone who would be
available. Outside directors at large companies are typically
people who are well along in their careers, with senior jobs at
other companies, or may be semiretired.
</P>
<P>
   The picture is often different at smaller companies, where the
boardroom-to-executive-suite path is not as rare, corporate
governance experts say. A small company's directors do not
necessarily have senior positions elsewhere, and may be more ready
to make a career change. These companies are also a bit less likely
to have an heir apparent in place, and may not be deep with
management talent.
</P>
<P>
   All of those factors played a role at Camdata, a small computer
software company in Fountain Valley, Calif. David Frosh, a regional
vice president at Automatic Data Processing with previous
experience as a software marketing executive, joined its board in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   When the board discussed problems that Camdata's service
department was having trying to ensure prompt responses to calls
from clients, Frosh volunteered to oversee a reorganization of the
department. The results so pleased his colleagues that the company
chose him as its president in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one inside was ready yet to be president,'' Frosh recalled
in an interview. ``If we had gotten a total outsider, he would not
have been up to speed for maybe a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Camdata was fortunate to have on its board someone like Frosh,
an outsider with direct experience in its industry _ and who is not
retired. Active executives of competing companies are never
considered for board seats, so outside directors generally must
come from outside the industry, not just outside the company.
</P>
<P>
   Roger M. Kenny, managing director of Boardroom Consultants,
based in New York, said that hiring such directors as executives
can mean some compromises. ``You have to ask if their experience is
translatable to your company,'' Kenny said. ``But if you pick your
board right, you have some great athletes who could probably run
most any company.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many uncertainties attend the more common tactic of
hiring outside executives who are not on the company's board.
Newcomers are usually unfamiliar with a company's culture, and it
is difficult to predict how they will get along with the board.
Such risks are sharply reduced when a new executive is chosen from
among the company's directors, corporate governance experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, directors are most likely to be chosen when a company is
in crisis, as when a top executive is dismissed for poor
performance and the board, seeking a change in direction, decides
to pass over a designated successor.
</P>
<P>
   In such a case, looking to the board can be the safer solution,
said Gary Liebl of Los Angeles, a retired technology executive who
over the last 16 years has served on the boards of 25 companies:
``Is it going to be riskier to bring in someone from the outside,
or select a member of the board who knows the lay of the land?''

 &HT;    Atlanta's Fernbank Egyptian exhibit a treat
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Our fascination with ancient Egypt stems largely from
its way of death. But artifacts of this culture give us more than
mummies. As Fernbank's ``Life and Death Under the Pharaohs''
reminds us so well, the power of Egyptian art is as enduring as,
well, the pyramids.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, our first major Egyptian art exhibition has mummies.
Humans. A very skinny cat. A baby crocodile, too. Yes, it has
coffins, gorgeous ones, bearing the faces and mane of hair we know
so well, decorated with intricate images and hieroglyphs. It alsso
features a narrow sarcophagus for an eel. The show even includes a
replica of a painted tomb you can enter, where archaeologist once
found a whole family of mummies.
</P>
<P>
   But the exhibition is not limited to the eternal afterlife. Its
300 objects are so arranged to give you a sense of how the
Egyptians lived in this life, too. Nothing like a pair of palm-leaf
sandals and a make-up jar, not to mention a letter inked on papyrus
chiding the recipient for not writing, to remind us that Egyptians
were humans not unlike us.
</P>
<P>
   Through statues and reliefs of the gods and leaders, we learn
how they worshipped and were governed as well.
</P>
<P>
   Fernbank sees to it that learning is a dramatic experience. For
pure atmosphere, it's hard to beat walking through the portal of a
``temple'' to the accompaniment of mysterious music and into a
darkened chamber to face a striking gilt and bronze sculpture of
Osiris, god of the dead.
</P>
<P>
   An art museum might not have used the reproduction temple facade
and the forest of hulking columns amid which the cases are set
because they are inauthentic. They do, however, make a heck of a
stage set.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the figurines and stone tablets relating to the
Egyptian pantheon and the propitiatory rituals need much help. The
images of the gods, often with animal heads on idealized human
bodies, are as curious as they are well-made.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these artifacts are, in a word, beautiful. Drawn from
the exceptional collection of the National Museum of Antiquities in
Leiden, The Netherlands, the exhibition showcases the skill of
ancient artisans _ be they potters, sculptors, bookmakers or
jewelers. They applied themselves to the decoration of a spoon with
as much imagination and care as an incarnation of a god. Amonnakht,
an artisan who worked on the tombs in the Valley of the Kings
around 1250 B.C., is immortalized in a graceful wood statue, decked
out in his best skirt and holding a ram-head staff.
</P>
<P>
   The section about government and political history includes some
of the most impressive, larger-scale stone and wood sculptures.
These depict the pharaohs _ ancient Egypt's religious and political
leaders _ and the members of their families and court with great
dignity and monumentality. The limestone statue of chief physician
Juty, dating to 1300 B.C., is a great example of this regal
bearing. It also exemplifies Egyptian craftsmanship and style, from
the slightly blocky pose softened by such details as the careful
delineation of the pleats of his skirt to the soft curve of his
bald head.
</P>
<P>
   The relief carving is just as fine. Sculptors knew just how to
coax out the curve a of a cheek or the bulge of a muscle even if
they barely dented the surface of the stone. In some you can also
see the original color. As exemplified by the 19th century drawings
Fernbank has added to the show, Egyptian environments were awash
with vivid hues and dense patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors reach the climactic gallery of mummies and sarcophagi
through a narrow midnight blue hallway. It is lined with sheets
from the Book of the Dead, which contained incantations the dead
would need to ensure a successful afterlife. Wall texts explain the
reasons behind the elaborate burial rituals. This is where to find
the reproduction of an actual tomb, decorated floor to ceiling with
painted images of the family in the afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the artifacts shown elsewhere were discovered in the
precinct of this very tomb; It would have been exciting to see them
together. I also wish some of the cases were taller so that you
were not looking so far down to get a close look at the objects.
</P>
<P>
   But those are quibbles. ``Life and Death Under the Pharoahs'' is
truly a rare opportunity to see Egyptian objects of the highest
quality in Atlanta. Their installation_ designed to help us better
understand how ancient Egyptians lived, and died, and lived again_
turns a rare opportunity into a special experience.
</P>

   ``Life and Death Under the Pharaohs: Egyptian Art from the
National Museum of Antiquities in Leiden, The Netherlands.''

WILL OLD CD-ROM DRIVES BE CAPABLE OF READING CD-R, CD-RW DISKS? 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I enjoyed your reviews of CD-ROM ``burners'' a few weeks ago,
but I am confused about something. You referred to both writable
and rewritable CDs and drives, and implied that the drives you
mentioned can do both. But how interchangeable are they? Can I use
either kind of disks in any old CD-ROM drive, even if it's not a
CD-RW? When do you want to use a writable disk, and when would you
use a rewritable disc?
</P>
<P>
   (Note: The CD-ROM ``burners'' review can be accessed at
www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/tech/364618)
</P>
<P>
   A: First, some definitions. A writable compact disc can be
written to just once, while a rewritable disc can be written to,
erased and written to again many times over.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, a finished writable disc _ called CD-R _ can
be read in just about any CD-ROM drive. A rewritable disc, or
CD-RW, can only be read in a CD-RW drive, unless it's been closed
so that no more data can be written to it. Then, it can be read in
a standard CD-ROM drive. But some newer, nonwritable CD-ROM drives
now have the ability to read CD-RWs that are still open.
</P>
<P>
   In general, you want to use CD-Rs for making backup copies of
programs and music CDs. They're also great for storing and
preserving graphics and other multimedia files. And because they
are fairly inexpensive _ between $1.50 and $2 each _ they can also
be used as throwaway backup media. When the backup becomes out of
date, just toss it.
</P>
<P>
   CD-RW is best for backups when you want to overwrite older data
with new. Prices for the disks range from $2.50 to $5, down
dramatically from just a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Q: No wonder the record industry is upset about the MP3 craze!
My son just showed me how easy it is to find and download music
from so-called pirate sites. Do the record companies know about
these? Is anything being done to shut them down?
</P>
<P>
   A: The recording industry is well aware of these sites, and has
been aggressive about trying to shutter them when found.
</P>
<P>
   Pirate MP3 sites usually offer copyright music by posting it
through an FTP server _ software that lets users connect and
download files. These servers allow what is known as anonymous
downloads _ you don't have use your real name to connect. Many
pirate music sites use MP3 as both the login and password, so there
is no record of who visited and grabbed potentially illegal files.
</P>
<P>
   The pirate sites usually connect via an IP address, and you can
find them at any of several MP3 search engines. But those IP
addresses can change every time the pirate connects to his or her
provider. So if a record industry lawyer serves notice on a site,
it may disappear and then pop up somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   The industry recently announced it was launching a campaign to
stamp out pirate sites by going after the Internet providers who
host the pirates. This will be on a global basis, making it tough
for some pirate sites to move overseas to escape.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I like to take pictures I find on the Web and turn them into
Windows wallpaper. I do this by right-clicking on the image in
Internet Explorer and then choosing Set As Wallpaper. But every
time I do this, I lose the previous image completely. Is there any
way to save the image so it doesn't go away when I do this again?
</P>
<P>
   A: Your browser always saves wallpaper generated this way under
the same name _ Internet Explorer Wallpaper.bmp in the Windows
folder. Use My Computer to go into that folder, find the file and
right-click on it. Choose Rename, and then change the name to
better describe the image, and make sure it still ends with a .BMP.
</P>
<P>
   The file with its new name should appear in your list of
available wallpaper selections.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a way, Ernest Garcia and George Akers are flip
sides of the same badly tarnished policy coin, the battle against
raging unemployment in the inner cities. Both have operated small
businesses and received loans from the Los Angeles Community
Development Bank, an unusually ambitious, federally financed effort
to bring a measure of prosperity to depressed areas of this city.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, after his metal-plating business burned to
the ground, Garcia ran out of capital and hope. He had been
rejected by every commercial bank he approached, and finally turned
to the Community Development Bank for a $500,000 loan to rebuild in
his old neighborhood, East Los Angeles. The bank came through and
today his thriving company, West Coast Metal Finishing, has
increased its payroll from 7 workers to 42, and hums with the
sounds of heavy machinery and a salsa beat.
</P>
<P>
   The bank now celebrates his success with words it once reserved
for Akers' company, Trinity Knitworks, a garment maker. Akers and a
partner received the Community Development Bank's very first loan,
for $700,000 in 1996, when they sought to save Trinity and its
roughly 150 jobs. But Akers now says acidly that the loan was so
badly botched by the bank that he was effectively in default from
its first day. The company, overwhelmed by debt, has been shuttered
and Akers is mired in litigation with the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia says the bank saved his life; Akers says it just about
ruined his. In fact, the bank has produced a mix of such personal
tales, despite the confident assertions of backers like Vice
President Al Gore, who has endorsed the enterprise during visits
here and once proclaimed, ``This is an example of how an economic
empowerment program should work.''
</P>
<P>
   But the harsh reality is that, over all, this grand, $435
million government experiment has had negligible impact on
depressed areas of Los Angeles, even during an economic boom, and
the bank has been a crushing disappointment to many.
</P>
<P>
   Its loan default rate is a towering 32 percent, largely because
of one huge failure, and it has created a tiny fraction of the jobs
it promised. The Department of Housing and Urban Development, which
financed the bank, says the fault lies at least partly with lax
oversight by the city, while the city complains that the federal
money came with too many strings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The past year at the bank has not been enjoyable,'' said Peter
Taylor, an investment banker at Lehman Brothers and a member of the
development bank's board. ``It's time to catch our breath and
narrow our mission and make the implementation of the idea work
properly.'' Both the city and the federal government want to keep
trying.
</P>
<P>
   To salvage the idea, the troubled development bank is being
reorganized. It is searching for a new chief executive, adding
staff and loosening some operating methods as it struggles to learn
from its mistakes and land on the right formula for stimulating
growth in areas that have been left further and further behind in
the current expansion. The bank has written a new business plan
that the City Council is scheduled to debate soon.
</P>
<P>
   Many people here remain deeply wary, but hopeful. So far, the
lending ``has not made a meaningful difference in my district,''
said Rita Walters, who represents South-Central Los Angeles, a
focus of the bank's lending, on the City Council. ``This is a whole
different world in here, and we cannot give up on it. The execution
needs to be better.''
</P>
<P>
   Marva Smith Battle-Bey, executive director of the
Vermont-Slauson Economic Development Corp., a nonprofit group that
invests in poor areas, added: ``That was a hard-fought battle to
get that bank and get it located in that neighborhood. It would
negatively affect investment there if this went south now. I feel
strongly that we need to make it a more viable instrument.''
</P>
<P>
   The interim chief executive of the bank, Linda Griego,
acknowledges the problems and argues that the Community Development
Bank can become more viable. ``A lot rides on this experiment,''
she said. ``A lot of people went out on the line for this. Some of
what's happened is just unbelievable, but it can be fixed in my
view.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the giddily prosperous era of the so-called new economy,
talking about high unemployment in depressed urban neighborhoods
may seem an anachronism, like discussing rust-prevention methods at
an Internet company. But even as the rates of teen-age pregnancy
and crime are dropping, joblessness in many cities remains
disturbingly intractable.
</P>
<P>
   Watts, for instance, which was convulsed by civil disturbances
twice in the last 31 years, has shifted from a mostly black to a
mostly Hispanic neighborhood, and it has been the target of many
government job programs. But the unemployment rate still hovers
near 20 percent, compared with 4.1 percent nationally.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Community Development Bank represents one of the
most expensive efforts to try a new philosophy in job creation.
These efforts are often described as partnerships, since the view
is that the government can merely help foster the growth of
businesses that must be able to survive on their own. The theory
was summed up in 1995 in an article in The Harvard Business Review
by Michael E. Porter, a professor at Harvard Business School.
</P>
<P>
   In it, Porter said job creation would come only ``through
private, for-profit initiatives and investment based on economic
self-interest and genuine competitive advantage _ not through
artificial inducements, charity or government mandates.''

 LOS ANGELES: government mandates.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo agrees: ``government is the
facilitator for the private sector. You have to promote
private-sector growth in there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Community Development Bank was set up by the
Clinton administration in the aftermath of the 1992 riots here. Los
Angeles had failed to qualify for designation as an Empowerment
Zone, a status that gives businesses an array of incentives to
operate in depressed neighborhoods and employ local people.
Furious, the city argued that it deserved some assistance, and the
administration eventually offered the development bank as a sort of
consolation prize. (Parts of the city have since received the
Empowerment Zone designation.)
</P>
<P>
   The bank was supposed to use public financing merely to water
the seeds of the private sector _ to help entrepreneurs help
themselves and then to get out of their way. In return, the
entrepreneurs were obliged to locate in the depressed areas _ a
patchwork of sites totaling 19 square miles, mostly to the south
and the east of downtown _ and hire at least half their new
employees from the neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   There are several other community development banks around the
country, in cities like Cleveland and Washington, but none are as
large, as political in their origins or as dependent on federal
funds as the Los Angeles bank. By the end of 2004, it is supposed
to have lent out all $435 million _ and then see that it is all
paid back.
</P>
<P>
   But that is becoming problematic at best. Of the $97 million in
loans it had extended as of Sept. 30, nearly a third have gone bad.
The bank's largest loan, $24.1 million to a dairy operation called
Copeland Beverage Group, exceeded the bank's own loan limit of $20
million to a single borrower, and it has been written off. The
company has been shut down. An additional $7.2 million of loans are
now listed as very high risk if not actual losses.
</P>
<P>
   The bank says it has fostered the creation or retention of 1,258
jobs, only 41 percent of the 3,039 required under the terms of the
loans it has made. (Companies are obliged to create at least one
job for every $35,000 borrowed.) And just 249 of those jobs went to
people living in the Empowerment Zone, fewer than a third of the
number required. The bank points out that since the companies have
two years to meet the standards, there is still time for some of
them to hire more people.
</P>
<P>
   But the figures are actually worse than they look. The bank's
employment statistics include nonexistent jobs _ positions created
or retained by companies that later failed, like Copeland and
Trinity. (The bank counts jobs created by its borrowers as well as
jobs retained by companies that would have closed without the
loans.) About 276 such jobs have vanished.
</P>
<P>
   The bank's proponents say that, at least in part, some of the
difficulties are built into its charter. It can now lend only to
companies
</P>
<P>
   that have been rejected by commercial banks, yet it places a
heavy burden on these companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's look at the reality,'' said Caron Caines, a member of
the Empowerment Zone Oversight Committee, a watchdog group
appointed by the City Council. ``You're going to lend money to
businesses that no one wants to lend money to, and then you're
going to saddle them with the responsibility of creating all these
jobs. I don't get it. What this policy does is to transfer the very
important policy goal of creating jobs to some of the weakest
members of the business community. These businesses have a hard
enough time just surviving.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Caines added: ``It's a grand experiment. But with that you
have to constantly monitor and evaluate and adjust the program to
make it work. None of that happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Griego, a former deputy mayor, was brought in this summer
after the first chief executive, C. Robert Kemp, resigned because
of illness. She is leading the reorganization and helping to find a
permanent chief executive _ with luck, by the end of the year. She
said that every candidate who was approached initially had turned
the job down cold, but that some people were now interested. Even
the bank's sponsors _ HUD and the city _ have distanced themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would beg you not to use the bank as a platform to talk
about the bigger issues here,'' said Rockard Delgadillo, Los
Angeles' deputy mayor for economic development. ``It is one element
of what I would say is a large number for attacking this issue.
It's not a silver bullet. In fact, we've had more success with
other products.''
</P>
<P>
   The city has a new program, Genesis L.A., focusing on
encouraging businesses to locate in 15 old industrial sites. The
Community Development Bank is a bit player in the plan, well down
the list of incentives that include discounts on utility rates and
accelerated city permits.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said in an interview that the bank's problems were the
city's, not the federal government's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can count on one hand the number of conversations I've had
with them,'' said Cuomo, emphasizing that Washington had not
meddled. ``The prevailing winds are devolution. The new ideas are
coming from the new breed of mayor. We do not come in and
micromanage.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I don't know that there's necessarily a lesson'' in
the bank's well-publicized problems.
</P>
<P>
   But many experts do see lessons, if not in the politics then in
a better understanding of what small businesses here really need.
Even some critics of the development bank, and there are many, say
it has shed some light on a more fruitful path.
</P>
<P>
   The bank's new business plan, put together during Ms. Griego's
tenure, includes some shifts in direction that are meant to take
advantage of the experiences so far.

TOP-PRIORITY GAME FOR VIRGINIA TECH AGAINST MIAMI

<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACKSBURG, Va. _ The task is as evident as it is difficult. Win
Saturday night's game against the University of Miami, and there is
a better than even chance that the Virginia Tech Hokies will be
back in the No. 2 slot of the controversial and important Bowl
Championship Series rankings.
</P>
<P>
   A loss Saturday night would have even more definitive
consequences. Bye-bye, so-long, see you in September, which will be
the next time we talk about the Hokies as a national championship
contender.

   The game Saturday night at Lane Stadium is arguably the most
important in Tech history.
</P>
<P>
   If you listen to Hokies coach Frank Beamer and Miami coach Butch
Davis, the primary concern is that it is a Big East game whose
winner will have a leg up on the league title.
</P>
<P>
   Left unsaid, for the time being, is the national significance of
the game, a rarity in recent years for any Big East matchup.
</P>
<P>
   Tech is clearly the team with the target on its back now. Under
Beamer, the Hokies have built themselves into more than a regional
power. They are unbeaten (8-0) this late in the year for the first
time in their history. And they are the flashpoint of the whole BCS
process, which weighs not only wins and losses but strength of
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Which is a sore point for Hokie fans, who have to defend the
scheduling of such ``powers'' as 1-AA James Madison and fledgling
1-A program Alabama-Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   But the bottom line is that Tech is very much a good _ perhaps
great _ team, no matter what its schedule suggests.
</P>
<P>
   And the key to that greatness may very well be a redshirt
freshman quarterback named Michael Vick.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Vick guy has given them a new dimension on offense,''
said West Virginia coach Don Nehlen, who saw that extra dimension
when Vick led the Hokies on a 58-yard scoring drive in the last
minute of what turned into a 22-20 Tech win, a victory which made
Saturday night's game so important.
</P>
<P>
   The Hokies come into their game against the Hurricanes as the
new beast of the Big East, a team that can beat you with Vick at QB
and a defense as nasty as it is good. The Hokies beat opponents up,
as evidenced by the 62-0 pounding they gave Syracuse earlier this
season in what was labeled the first ``game of the year''.
</P>
<P>
   Miami, which has rebounded from its mini-slump earlier in the
year when it lost to Florida State (expected) and East Carolina
(unexpected), is the type of team that can provide trouble for the
Hokies, especially with quarterback Kenny Kelly, by far the most
talented QB the Hokies will face during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone recognizes how talented Virginia Tech is,'' said
Davis. ``It's the one team in the country that puts as much
pressure on you to prepare in all three phases of the game. They
have a great reputation defensively _ an eight-man front concept _
they blitz and bring a lot of pressure. Offensviely, they have a
tremendous amount of speed at quarterback and great athleticism
with Michael Vick.And their big notoriety (is) special teams.''
</P>
<P>
   All of that makes the Hokies a solid favorite, although the
Hokies' narrow escapes in wins over Pittsburgh two weeks ago and
last week against West Virginia have created a sense of
vulnerbility.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that proves to be true will also determine whether the
Big East, maligned in recent years, has a genuine contender for the
national title.

 LOS ANGELES: so far.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among the changes is a switch toward finding commercial banks to
go in as co-lenders, to ensure that market discipline and
professional underwriters are focused on the companies. In
addition, the bank intends to do more indirect lending, in which it
will provide funds to other, more experienced nonprofit
organizations in poor neighborhoods and then allow those groups to
make the actual loans to needy companies. That is intended to
correct what Ms. Griego said had been a major problem: that the
development bank was trying to create a lending and underwriting
department from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been reinventing the wheel,'' Ms. Griego said. ``It's
expensive, and it doesn't work to have our own people doing all
that. We're not going to compete in this market. We're putting
people with less experience than commercial bankers out there in
this market. It does not make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that in working jointly with commercial banks, the aim
was to find more resilient and experienced borrowers, not just
companies that had been rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like being a doctor and all of your patients have
serious cancer,'' said J. Eugene Grigsby III, director of the
Advanced Policy Institute at the University of California at Los
Angeles and a member of the bank's board. ``The rules we started
with say in effect that we deal only with the financial
untouchables. We ought to have more flexibility.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said the rules on job creation and the need for the
businesses to be in the Empowerment Zone should be loosened. ``The
last thing a lot of start-up companies need is a requirement that
they should create a lot of jobs quickly,'' Grigsby said. ``They
have to keep costs down for a while and minimize their payroll to
survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Going forward, the bank plans to look for ways to provide not
only standard bank loans, known as senior debt, but also equity and
subordinated debt to borrowers, since that capital is more
``patient.'' It is longer term and can be used to help attract
capital from usual commercial sources, thus getting the borrowers
into the private markets more quickly. The bank already has a small
venture-capital fund but is looking to expand the ways it invests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming up with another debt program does not really help this
community,'' said Roberto Barragan, interim president of the Valley
Economic Development Center, a nonprofit organization that has done
lending deals with the Community Development Bank. Bank officials
built their strategy, he said, ``on the model of big companies,
which can service a lot of debt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a philosophy that's been pretty much trashed for these
small businesses,'' he added. ``They decided on a debt solution
before anyone had asked about the real needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Akers of Trinity Knitworks had much the same view. ``I didn't
need debt,'' he said. ``I needed working capital.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed changes in the bank's business plan have been long
in coming. Other institutions have used some of these new ideas
with great success.
</P>
<P>
   It is illuminating, for example, to compare the experience of
the Los Angeles Community Development Bank with a private-sector
organization called the California Economic Development Lending
Initiative. It is a consortium of 45 banks that has a lending
capacity of about $65 million, specifically for companies in
depressed areas.
</P>
<P>
   The Community Development Bank, which began with $435 million in
capital, took two months to start running and 14 months to make its
first loan. It was under great political pressure to put money into
the community quickly. Almost no one on the staff had extensive
commercial banking experience.
</P>
<P>
   The private consortium, by contrast, solicited two grants and
used them for a two-year study on how it should operate before it
took its first organizational step. Its staff is made up almost
entirely of experienced lending officers. Today, the private
consortium has made about $29 million in loans, with only 2 percent
of the total in default.
</P>
<P>
   George Williamson, the consortium's chief executive, insists
that his organization work with commercial banks to make sure that
the borrowers stay close to the private markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a close relationship with banks is an important part of
our strategy,'' he said. ``I would see dealing with companies no
bank would lend to as a silly way to proceed.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some experts who say that the Community Development
Bank has legitimate functions, but that it should get out of direct
lending, because it requires too many skills. Instead, they say
that it should be only a co-lender with commercial banks, or that
it should lend indirectly through other nonprofit groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point I think they need to look at the possibility of
closing down the direct lending altogether, just close it,''
Barragan said. ``They should give management of the portfolio to
somebody else who has the experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Caines of the Empowerment Zone Oversight Committee
said that her group had surveyed the bank's borrowers and that she
was slightly surprised by the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all said the paperwork was overwhelming them,'' she said.
``And it was clear the bank was really weak on technical assistance
to these companies. But, truthfully, I expected it to be more
negative.''
</P>
<P>
   Albert Gold, the chairman of Gold Graphics in Pacoima, a town at
the northern end of the San Fernando Valley that lies in the
Empowerment Zone, said his business was thriving until the
Northridge earthquake in 1994. The roof of the plant collapsed, and
Gold said he was woefully underinsured. He had a strong track
record and was able to secure a loan from the Community Development
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, the earthquake was the best thing that could
have happened to us because it caused us to undertake an
involuntary upgrade of all our facilities,'' he said. ``The
technology we put in was the technology the market was looking
for.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had gone from about 90 employees to about 180. But
one big drawback, he said, was the full year it took to have his
loan approved and financed _ a frequent complaint about the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Not far from his modern printing plant is a store called Double
D Western Wear, another loan recipient. Abel Diaz, the owner, is
bitter about his experience. Diaz said the bank forced him to incur
$18,000 in costs, mostly for accounting work and an expensive
appraisal of his property, just to get the $420,000 loan, . And in
the year it took him to get the financing, his business had
declined so much that he actually needed more capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us here ran into the same situation,'' said Diaz, who
has run the store for more than 30 years. ``We came to them because
we were in trouble and needed the money. What were we supposed to
do in that year?''
</P>
<P>
   The bank said Diaz was in trouble from the start and that it had
offered enormous assistance to help him keep afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia of West Coast Metal Finishing said his experiences speak
to the bank's possibilities. On his office walls are photos of
himself with President Clinton, Gore and Los Angeles Mayor Richard
Riordan _ all elements in the dream he says he has experienced.
</P>
<P>
   ``You grow up in East L.A., and you don't have anything in this
life, and there I was at the White House,'' Garcia said, recalling
his visit there. ``They gave me an opportunity. Who else is going
to do that around here?''

TABLES ARE TURNED FOR BC, WEST VIRGINIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A year ago, the Boston College football team limped
into Morgantown, W.Va., for its season finale with nothing left to
salvage except pride. The West Virginia Mountaineers, meanwhile,
were looking to score their seventh victory of the season in the
hopes of improving their chances for a bowl bid.
</P>
<P>
   West Virginia defeated the Eagles, 35-10, and picked up another
victory over Pittsburgh, 52-14, in the season finale to land a
berth in the Insight.com Bowl in Tucson, Ariz. The Eagles retreated
to Chestnut Hill and pondered all that went awry after a 3-0 start
ended with six losses in their last seven games and a 4-7 record.
</P>
<P>
   Now the roles have been reversed.
</P>
<P>
   When BC (6-3 overall, 3-2 conference) hosts the Mountaineers
(3-6, 2-3) in Saturday's Big East home finale at Alumni Stadium,
the Eagles _ who this week vaulted from the obscurity of the
``others receiving votes'' to the No. 25 spot in the USA Today/ESPN
coaches' poll _ will be playing for their seventh victory of the
season and a chance to improve their posture for a postseason bid
to either the Insight.com Bowl, the Music City Bowl in Nashville,
or the Gator Bowl in Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   Favored by 3 1/2 points, the Eagles will enter the game rested
and refreshed from a week off after scoring a stirring 24-23
victory at Syracuse Oct. 30.
</P>
<P>
   And the Mountaineers? They will limp into the game after
absorbing a crushing 22-20 loss last week against third-ranked
Virginia Tech. It was a stinging setback for West Virginia in which
starting quarterback Marc Bulger, hampered by a fractured right
index finger that sidelined him for three weeks, was knocked out of
the game because of a chipped bone in his right (throwing) thumb.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question Marc came in as the guy who was going to keep us
going,'' said West Virginia coach Don Nehlen. ``He got hurt in our
opener and was very, very average, and he was about 90 percent when
we went to Syracuse and got hurt there. He was out for three more
weeks, and he's probably played with that hand at about 85 percent,
and now he's got a thumb to go with the finger on the same hand, so
he's out again. It's just been a disaster for poor Marc.''
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, the heroic effort of backup quarterback
Brad Lewis, who threw a pair of touchdowns that put the
Mountaineers ahead, 20-19, with 1:15 to play, was nullified when
Hokies kicker Shayne Graham hit a winning 44-yard field goal as
time expired.
</P>
<P>
   Also lost in the rubble of that devastating setback was the
impressive 133-yard rushing performance of freshman Avon Cobourne
against the Hokies' stingy defense, ranked first in the league and
No. 3 in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go along with the theory that a wounded animal is the
most dangerous animal, then they'd probably fit that classification
right now,'' BC coach Tom O'Brien said of the Mountaineers.
``They're a talented football team and they lost seven NFL players
from a year ago, but they still have about 18 seniors and 10
juniors on their roster, so they have a lot of good football
players in that program. I'm sure they have a lot of pride, and I'm
sure they want to come up here and play well.''
</P>
<P>
   BC's seniors are focused on matching the intensity.
</P>
<P>
   It will be Senior Day at The Heights, and for the first time in
their careers, BC's seniors will be playing a November game of
great importance _ all of which will only add to the emotionally
charged atmosphere. In fact, the last time the Eagles played such a
meaningful game at Alumni Stadium was Nov. 26, 1993, when BC,
coming off a momentous 41-39 upset of top-ranked Notre Dame,
returned from South Bend, Ind., to host West Virginia for the Big
East championship and ceded the league title and a trip to the
Sugar Bowl with a 17-14 loss.
</P>
<P>
   The following Nov. 19, the Mountaineers again posed an obstacle
to BC's bowl plans when the 6-2-1 Eagles went to Morgantown in need
of a seventh victory to seal an invite from the Fiesta Bowl
representatives in attendance. BC lost the game, 21-20, on a failed
fourth-and-1 attempt in West Virginia territory, wound up dropping
the season finale at Miami, 23-7, and went on to accept a bid to
the 1994 Aloha Bowl, which marked the last time BC earned a bowl
berth.
</P>
<P>
   Time for some payback?
</P>
<P>
   ``When we ended our season last year, this was one of the teams
that we couldn't wait to play again,'' said senior free safety
Pedro Cirino. ``They tried to rub it in our faces last year. At the
end of the game, they were throwing passes, deep balls, against us
with less than a minute left, and they were trying to run it up on
us. Hey, that's the way some programs do their thing. If we get our
chance, I just hope Coach O'Brien does the same thing to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Said junior quarterback Tim Hasselbeck, ``Anytime you go down
there to play, it's hard. Their fans are brutal, and if they get
the opportunity, they'll beat you 80 to nothing, so I really don't
think there's any love lost between the two of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, at the same time, I don't think that's the issue. I think
the issue is that we have a chance to win another game and maybe
get ourselves into a bowl game. It's also the last time that our
seniors will play in this stadium, which should be incentive
enough.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Confidentially, I did have a little problem with
Barbara Walters,'' the butler is saying on the phone from England.
``20/20. They said they needed something new _ would I be willing
to discuss A, B and C? _ and of course I could not. A relationship
between two people is a very special thing, it cannot be bought.
I've been offered a million pounds to tell my story, and I can't do
that. If I gave it away, who would I be? I wouldn't be the person
she called `My rock,' would I?''
</P>
<P>
   Poor Paul Burrell, who was butler to the late Diana, Princess of
Wales: Everybody wants to to exploit him and learn his secrets
about life with Di.
</P>
<P>
   I wish only to exploit him as a butler, to have for one magic
night a British butler in what, after only two long-distance
conversations with Burrell, I have come to think of as my Greenwich
Village ``flat.'' It is somewhat less grand than the last apartment
of the princess, a five-bedroom in Kensington Palace. I am just
guessing here, but I do not believe the princess kept her bicycle
next to her bed, or had dinner parties at which her guests sat on
the floor around the coffee table because the dining room table was
too small to seat more than four and the dining room did not exist.
This, however, is not the point.
</P>
<P>
   The point, according to a new book by Burrell, ``In the Royal
Manner: Expert Advice on Etiquette and Entertaining From the Former
Butler to Diana, Princess of Wales'' (Warner, $28), is that, let me
quote here, ``Style is not the exclusive preserve of the rich and
the famous. Style can be achieved by anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   That anyone is going to be me, assisted by Burrell, and now we
are setting up plans. I have in mind something I have been
desperate to do: a sit-down dinner for the 200 or so people with
dining rooms whom I owe. Burrell, a cheery fellow of 41, who, as he
will point out to me when we meet, looks very much like Tom Hanks
but who, unlike Tom, is presently without a full-time gig, puts the
kibosh on that.
</P>
<P>
   ``A dinner party will be difficult without a dining room,''
Burrell says, with exquisite butlerish manners. ``I think you
should make it as simple as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   This is my notion of what it will be like to have my own butler:
he will allow me to entertain as if I were an ex-wife of Ronald
Perelman. We will take a relaxed stroll, perhaps, to select the
wine and flowers, and then I will go off and nap. It will be the
most relaxed dinner party of my life.
</P>
<P>
   Only this is not the way it turns out.
</P>
<P>
   First there is the question of the food. ``In The Royal Manner''
has recipes, and as Burrell's contention is that anyone can
entertain in style, I had figured that Burrell and I (i.e.,
Burrell, as I cook nothing more ambitious than popcorn) would
prepare the food together. Burrell, however, has made it perfectly
clear, in the nicest possible way, that this might be ``an awful
lot'' to do, and we should get someone ``to knock it together'' in
the kitchen. In other words, before even arriving in New York, the
butler is demanding a cook. My friend Steve Jones, one of the
owners of the Knickerbocker Bar and Grill on University Place,
agrees to lend me his chef, Aaron Bashy.
</P>
<P>
   The larger problem is, I am exhausted cleaning up for the
butler. I polish the silver. I clear out the refrigerator, where a
container of milk and a wedge of blue cheese died in late summer.
The butler has said I need highball glasses, so I rush to Bed, Bath
&AMP; Beyond after work to get highball glasses. I stand in Gristede's
in front of the doilies, paralyzed with anxiety: doilies, don't
butlers live for doilies? Or are they considered tacky? If I do
need doilies, should they be square or round? From what Burrell has
told me, the butler's job is directing the staff, only in this
case, I am the staff. A butler, I see, is worse than company _ he
can go poking around everywhere. I scrutinize everything in the
apartment: that little Di and Charles china box from the wedding I
keep on the bedside stand _ should I put it away? He does still
seem pretty upset over her loss.
</P>
<P>
   And what about the flat? Can it possibly live up to the butler's
standards? He has told me he will be greeting my guests, then
bringing them in to me. I haven't had the heart to explain that
once he opens the door, they're in.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the day of the event, the butler arrives in a suit with
a knee-length jacket, with a nice big grin you can see down the
hall _ the building's hall, not my hall. Even at 50 feet, I can see
he's not a stiff British butler. The young woman with him is the
one who seems serious. She has the look of a no-nonsense book-tour
escort, there to make sure the fun-loving author makes the plane,
but this is not the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Louise Cosgrove, my PA,'' Burrell says, and, just as I'm
figuring out that my butler has a personal assistant, adds, ``I'll
let you in on a secret: she's my niece.''
</P>
<P>
   My apartment doesn't throw him. He compliments me on one of the
nicest things about it, the view of the Empire State Building. He
insists, under questioning, that he is not daunted by the size of
my 4-foot-wide kitchen _ a professional can entertain in any
surroundings, Burrell says. He was once involved in a banquet on
Tuvalu in the South Pacific where there was no electricity,
although local residents did most of the preparation.
</P>
<P>
   Doilies turn out not to be his thing. ``Honestly?'' he says when
he sees the package, in the tone your girlfriend uses when you try
on flowered pants.
</P>
<P>
   There is one surprising thing about him: Despite his refusals to
discuss his relationship with the princess, he can't stop referring
to her. ``I'm just looking to see if you have the princess'
favorite film,'' he says, examining my bookshelves.
</P>
<P>
   Which would be?
</P>
<P>
   ``Brief Encounter.''
</P>
<P>
   And, taking stock of the refrigerator: ``Veuve Clicquot _ did
you know that was the princess' favorite Champagne?''
</P>
<P>
   This is the menu the butler and I (i.e., the butler) have
decided on for the big night, which is to be a cocktail party with
finger food, on account of the lack of a dining-room table: Pimm's
cocktails (I think of them as a summer drink, but the butler says
they will be helpful as ``a talking point''), pasties, miniature
beef Wellington, leeks and mushrooms en croute and salad. (How is
that going to be finger food?) For dessert, we will serve a trifle,
which seems odd at a cocktail party, but the butler says it's is a
must. (``There's always a pudding in royal circles. The queen
always asks for a pudding, never a sweet or dessert.'')
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The recipes have been causing a small problem: Aaron the chef,
testing them in the Knickerbocker kitchen, is finding them bland
and has been spicing them up.
</P>
<P>
   There is no such problem with the butler, who sets out on our
shopping trip, full of enthusiasm and good cheer, despite having
arisen at 5:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   He loves New York; it's his favorite city; he and the princess
said many times that one day they would love to live in America.
For the right opportunity _ not butlering, because having worked
for ``the best,'' he has ended his butlering days _ he'd move here
with his wife and two sons in a minute, he says. Something having
to do with entertaining would be nice. He's writing a weekly advice
column on that in The Daily Mail and would love a TV show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like a bite of Martha Stewart's apple,'' is how he puts
it.
</P>
<P>
   He praises the selection in the markets, though he does not
throw money around. At the Crossroads Liquor store on 14th Street,
he turns down the $35 bottles of California wine he's offered for
bottles under $10: a '97 Pepperwood Grove cabernet sauvignon for
$6.99, a '97 Louis M. Martini cabernet sauvignon for $9.99. (Sound
bite: ``Entertaining is also about a budget. There is no point
serving expensive wines at a reception.'')
</P>
<P>
   He is also very taken with the tequila with the worms in the
bottle. He wants to get it for his friend Nigel back home, and when
sensible Louise tells him Nigel is too fastidious, would never
touch it, he buys a bottle of Vampire wine from Transylvania for
himself.
</P>
<P>
   He cannot, throughout the day, stop recalling Diana.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the name of that rose?'' the butler asks the owner of
the Ariston florist shop on 14th Street, where he chooses the
flowers for a pink and white display. ``It's exactly the rose I
used to bring for the princess _ 4:30 every Monday morning, I'd be
at Covent Garden, picking the flowers. ''
</P>
<P>
   I'm developing a theory about this title-dropping. I'm thinking
it's done not so much to remind people of the position Paul Burrell
once held with the most photographed woman in the world, but rather
as a widower might, or a jilted lover, who is not yet able to
accept his loss and leave the happiest part of his life behind.
</P>
<P>
   Because, from what he tells me over lunch, working in Buckingham
Palace was his dream. He grew up in a mining village in
Chesterfield, in north England, where his father drove a coal
truck. His home, which Burrell describes as very happy, had no
indoor bathroom. Burrell saw Buckingham Palace as a child of 8,
announced that someday he would work there. His mother worked in a
factory to put him through hotel school. At 18 he was off to the
palace, and within a year he was a footman for the queen. He
married a woman who was Diana's dresser, and they, like the
princess, had two sons. When the prince and princess divorced, the
princess asked that Paul Burrell go with her. Because, as Burrell
tells it, he was not only the butler; he was a soul mate,
protector, confidant _ a butler, as he explains it, of ``the new
school.''
</P>
<P>
   What is the difference between the old school and the new?
</P>
<P>
   ``One is traditional; the other is conventional,'' he says.
``One follows the rules to the letter. The other adapts his own
personality to the working environment. The princess would ask my
advice on how to dress. Remember that dress she wore to the
Serpentine gallery opening, black chiffon with long chiffon scarf?
I suggested that. If I'd been the butler in `The Remains of the
Day,' his master would never have asked advice on how to dress. The
princess often asked what I thought. I'd ask, `Do you want an
honest opinion?' She always did, and I'd give it to her. A lot
wouldn't. She knew I'd take care of her.''
</P>
<P>
   He speaks of visitors just getting to know the princess,
surprised at first at his presence in the room as they shared
stories. ``They didn't know who I was, thought I was a servant,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   There is a sad moment as we discuss the death of Diana. Burrell
remembers the queen's private secretary calling him at 3 a.m.,
asking him if he is standing or seated and then telling him to sit
down: The princess is dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized I was needed in Paris more than I was needed at
home, so I packed a small bag for myself and a bag for Diana,''
Burrell says, his eyes growing moist. ``Don't ask me what was in
it. It's as far as I've ever revealed or would ever reveal.''
</P>
<P>
   An article in People magazine reported, after the funeral, that
Burrell took to the hospital a dress for his princess, fixed her
hair and held her hand until her sisters arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Burrell speaks only of the weather that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember it was very windy at the Paris airport,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But let us segue to matters not so sad, the preparations at my
flat. Mel Brooks had it right: ``It's good to be the king.'' Or to
put it another way, ``It's good to have a butler.'' I leave my
apartment, in my role as staff, to return a trolley on which we
have schlepped supplies, and when I return 10 minutes later, my
apartment looks fabulous.
</P>
<P>
   The butler has put an antique wrinkled linen runner on the table
in the dining room, surrounded it with scalloped and starched white
linen place settings I have never used, found and laid out my
prettiest, if mismatched, Limoges and Bavarian pink and white
flowered plates. Now he's in my tiny kitchen, slicing English
cucumber and oranges and lemons and strawberries for the Pimm's
cocktails, garnishing the tall glasses with a slice of orange, a
slice of lemon, crushing a mint leaf in his fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pimm's makes me thinks of Ascot,'' he says. ``The 2:30 race
about to start, or Agassi on center court. There were people who
said I made the best Pimm's. In royal circles, it's done with
Champagne, but that's too extravagant. I served drinks at the royal
box, and little sandwiches and cakes and tea. We'd have tea between
the third and fourth races. There was a kitchen behind the royal
box.''
</P>
<P>
   Was the kitchen at the track smaller than mine?
</P>
<P>
   ``Bigger,'' Burrell says, grinning.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Tell me more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd arrive in a parade of carriages. I'd be riding on the
back of the queen's carriage. I'd jump off, open the door, follow
her into the royal box. All the ladies wore hats; the men wore
morning dress and top hats. I wore a stiff white frock shirt, white
tie, scarlet coat. I was sometimes able to invite my mum, and she
was so proud to see me riding along the route.''
</P>
<P>
   Happiest memory of royal service?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably looking after the queen and the royal party on
the princess' wedding day.''
</P>
<P>
   You went to the wedding?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I stayed back at the palace and walked the corgis.''
</P>
<P>
   The princess' wedding day, and he is walking the dogs?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, but I got to look after the bride and groom when they got
back. I served the top table, the bride's table. Just immediate
family. No more than 80 persons.''
</P>
<P>
   Tell what he saw at the wedding breakfast? Of course he won't.
</P>
<P>
   ``What goes on behind those walls stays behind those walls,'' he
says. Taking a swipe at the former cavalry officer who wrote a
memoir about his affair with the princess, he says, ``James Hewitt
did, and that's the difference _ a very significant difference''
between James Hewitt and himself.
</P>
<P>
   They were well acquainted?
</P>
<P>
   A stiff evasion. ``I knew him, and he was neither an officer nor
a gentleman.''
</P>
<P>
   The time of the party is almost upon us. Aaron the chef, a
high-energy guy with a downtown shaved head, who, unlike the
butler, feels no compunction about complaining about anyone,
arrives, telling the butler and his personal assistant about an
idiot woman who gave him and the Cornish pasties a hard time about
being in the passenger elevator. I, as I've seen in the movies,
leave the staff to do its work and retire to the bedroom to dress.
Given the size of the palace and the boom of Aaron's voice, it is
impossible not to hear some of the talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``That guy Hewitt who wrote the book about Diana _ he was kind
of a jerk, wasn't he?'' Aaron asks.
</P>
<P>
   I dive for my notebook.
</P>
<P>
   The butler's reply is too courteously quiet to be heard.
</P>
<P>
   The magic of that evening with my butler? Where to begin? I have
told my 10 guests I am doing a story on entertaining ``with help''
_ it is journalistic ethics to state one's purpose, and anyway they
would start wondering what was up when they saw the photographer _
but not all my guests know who the help is. I must say, with
downtown pride, they deal well with the presence of a butler. Lew
tells the butler he wishes to be announced as the Duke of
Wellington, and the butler cheerfully accommodate him.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the butler greets the guests, takes their coats (I
have explained that it is an ancient New York custom to throw them
onto the bed), makes friendly and amusing conversation, much of
which includes pointed references to Buckingham Palace and his
book. He asks the guests what they would like to drink and brings
each drink on a folded cloth napkin atop a plate, one hand behind
his back. His method of announcing dinner is different from that of
the New York hostess who address the guests as a group and invites
_ then exhorts, then entreats _ them to get something to eat. He
approaches the guests one or two at a time, asks if they would care
to have something to eat, takes them to the buffet and serves.
</P>
<P>
   There is one awkward moment when the butler greets my friend
Vicki, a strawberry blonde who once worked at People magazine, and
tells her that she looks just like Sarah Ferguson.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think so?'' Vicki asks. ``You know, I like her much better
than Di.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cole Porter is playing, the Pimm's cocktails are loaded with
gin, the food _ although Aaron considers the beef Wellington
overcooked and the butler calls it undercooked _ is wonderful, so
the awkward moment quickly fades. The party grows loud, the old
friends gossip, the time in the evening for the Champagne arrives.
</P>
<P>
   I have told the butler I am going to toast a forthcoming
marriage, but this is a lie. As soon as he has passed the glasses I
make a toast, in a room full of writers, to a fellow writer _ a
wonderful fellow and a great sport _ who has just published a book.
My friend Victor, who has hidden the butler's book under his
jacket, now holds it aloft, and we all drink to Paul Burrell, who
joins the party, along with Louise the Personal Assistant and Aaron
the cook. The rest of the night I get the drinks. I would tell you
what we talked about, but as my butler has already explained, the
things that go on beyond closed doors are private.

POTENTIAL GUSHER FOR SOUTHERN COASTAL STATES  
 KEEPING AN EYE ON UTILITIES  
 REBUILDING FISH STOCKS  
 OIL PATCH PROTESTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: The South, Calif., Alaska)  (mk) 
 By CARL HULSE and SEAN LOUGHLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Southern coastal states would be swimming in money
for conservation projects under a measure likely to surface in
Congress next year now that it has been endorsed by a key House
panel.
</P>
<P>
   The Conservation and Reinvestment Act would radically
redistribute money collected from offshore oil drilling royalties,
setting aside $3 billion annually for environmental preservation,
land purchases and coastline protection. Advocates say it would
provide the largest-ever infusion of federal dollars into
conservation efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Since the measure would distribute money based on miles of
shoreline and proximity to oil drilling, coastal states stand to
strike it rich, particularly those close to oil and gas rigs in the
Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana would receive $313 million, second only to
California's $327 million. Alabama would receive an estimated $53
million; Florida, $141 million; Georgia, $40 million; Mississippi,
$76 million; North Carolina, $44 million; South Carolina, $28
million, and Texas, $237 million.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the measure in the last days of the congressional
session by the usually divided Resources Committee was a milestone
and came after months of negotiations ended with a measure that
drew bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, head of the panel, hopes to move the
measure by next summer. But obstacles remain, including objections
from Western lawmakers who fear the money could finance a federal
land grab.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups are not satisfied either, saying the bill
could promote offshore drilling. Yet they embrace much of the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would not recommend the president sign it as now written,
but a handful of responsible changes can turn it into legacy
conservation legislation everyone in Congress can be proud of,''
said Rodger Schlickeisen, president of Defenders of Wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   POWER STRUGGLE
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists are keeping a close eye on spending measures
as Congress moves toward adjournment, worried that Southern and
Midwestern utilities being sued by the Environmental Protection
Agency may insert last-minute language intended to ease financial
penalties.
</P>
<P>
   The power companies, including Southern Co. and Tampa Electric,
are accused by the EPA of illegally modifying their coal-fired
plants to extend their life span without adding the necessary
pollution controls. The utilities deny the charge.
</P>
<P>
   Watchdog groups say a proposed amendment being circulated on
Capitol Hill is intended to allow the companies to escape the stiff
daily fines they face if the EPA charges are proved.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Ferrulo of Florida Public Interest Research Group said the
firms are seeking ``a safe haven from the fees and penalties that
may be imposed as a result of 20 years of complete disregard for
the law.''
</P>
<P>
   The utilities contend the proposal would simply give them the
ability to perform necessary maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   NO FISHING
</P>
<P>
   A new congressional proposal would prohibit commercial tuna,
shark and billfish fishing in parts of the South Atlantic and Gulf
of Mexico in an effort to rebuild stocks of the depleted but
popular game fish.
</P>
<P>
   Under legislation introduced by Sen. John Breaux, D-La.,
commercial longline harvesting of the migratory species would be
banned year-round from the border of North and South Carolina to
Key West, Fla., with seasonal closures in much of the Gulf of
Mexico. Commercial fishermen would be ``bought out'' under a $25
million program, with the costs shared by the federal government,
recreational fishermen and remaining commercial operators.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux said his proposal represents an agreement among key
groups that ``all want to protect small swordfish and other rapidly
declining fishing resources. A true solution will require
international cooperation, but we are taking a bold step to address
the problems in our own coastal waters.''
</P>
<P>
   VICE PRESIDENTIAL MATERIAL
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore's declaration that if elected president
he would ban oil and gas drilling in areas already leased to oil
companies off Florida and California continues to generate howls of
protest from the oil patch _ mainly from fellow Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux of Louisiana immediately lashed out at Gore's plan,
calling it ill advised. Now Rep. Chris John, D-La., is weighing in
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I, too, want to ensure that our marine and coastal environment
remains healthy and sustainable, but the policies you have outlined
jeopardize our domestic energy security, threaten the economies of
many communities dependent on the oil and gas industry and provide
little measurable environmental benefit,'' John wrote to Gore a few
days ago. So much for party unity.

REMOVABLE STORAGE ZIPS WITH THE TIMES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Zip drive revolutionized removable disk storage in the
early 1990s, it did so with a 100-megabyte disk in a portable drive
that connected either to a SCSI or a parallel port.
</P>
<P>
   In the PC world, most folks used the parallel port model;
Macintosh users went with SCSI. The Mac fans had it all over the PC
users here, because SCSI is much faster than a parallel port.
(Installing a SCSI port on a PC in those early days could result in
serious torment.) Often, the parallel port drives conflicted with
printers or scanners that were also connected.
</P>
<P>
   Today, those issues have vanished with the arrival of the
Universal Serial Bus port. Makers of removable drives finally have
a way to make using them virtually painless _ and fast.
</P>
<P>
   (That is, if you're using the right operating system. The
original Windows 95 doesn't support USB; the update that appeared
in early 1997, OSR2, does support it, but not well. Windows 98 is
the first serious implementation of it, and Windows 98 Second
Edition smooths out a lot of USB bugs.)
</P>
<P>
   Last week, I looked at a slew of USB devices. I'll finish up
this week with a look at two external, ``superfloppy'' drives that
now are available in USB versions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Zip 250 USB, $180, Iomega Corp.:  &UR;  &LR; When Iomega first
introduced its 250-megabyte Zip drive earlier this year, I was
disappointed to learn that it was only available in a poky parallel
or a SCSI model, just like the original Zip drive. USB already had
come into its own, but Iomega was holding out on us.
</P>
<P>
   The USB version of this higher-capacity drive is finally here,
and it was worth the wait. The new version is sleeker, easier to
use and more versatile. It works on both PCs and Macs. An optional
PC-card adapter is available so you can use this on a notebook
computer that may not have USB ports.
</P>
<P>
   This new drive is less than half the size of the original. It's
got a sculpted, semi-translucent blue shell. It easily could fit
into the thinnest briefcase, and with its light weight you wouldn't
even know it was there.
</P>
<P>
   The 250-MB disks come in six-packs at about $100. The 100-MB Zip
disks, which this drive also will read, can be found for about $10
each.
</P>
<P>
   Installation was a breeze. You install the Iomega software
first, shut down your system and plug in the drive. When your
system next boots up, it recognizes the drive, and it appears in
your My Computer folder. Easy-to-use software lets you reassign the
drive letter to your liking.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, this is a fast little drive, with a transfer
rate of up to 950 kilobytes a second. Copying a folder with 37 MB
of files onto a 250-MB disk took just 12 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   On its Web site, Iomega warns that there may be problems writing
to 100-MB data disks, though I had no problem doing so. I also
didn't notice any slowdown, though the site warned about that, too.
Your mileage, of course, may vary.
</P>
<P>
   _ SuperDisk Drive USB, $150, Imation: The SuperDisk drive _ also
known as an LS-120 drive _ is a great idea in theory. It gives you
a high-capacity removable-disk drive and lets you read standard
1.44-MB floppies.
</P>
<P>
   But the original technology had a major drawback _ it was slow.
In fact, it was agonizingly so in some cases. Waiting on a
parallel-port-based LS-120 drive to do its thing could put years on
you, or it felt like it, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Imation has revamped the system, improved the drivers and now
offers a USB version that is much more pleasant to use. It's not as
fast as the Zip, mind you, but it's a lot better than past models.
</P>
<P>
   The model I tried was about the size of the original Zip drive
and twice as heavy. It's really meant as a desktop drive; I suspect
its size has something to do with the mechanics necessary for
reading standard floppy disks.
</P>
<P>
   The LS-120 uses 120-MB disks that are slightly thinner than
floppies. A three-pack costs about $45, so they're a bit more
expensive than Zip disks.
</P>
<P>
   Installation also was simple, but it's the reverse of the Zip.
You plug in the drive first, and when Windows asks for drivers, you
insert a CD-ROM disc and install from there. Like the Zip, this
drive also will work on a Macintosh.
</P>
<P>
   The SuperDisk has a transfer rate of about 667 KB a second, and
it copied the 73-MB folder in about 20 seconds, noticeably longer
than it took for the Zip drive. It was also much noisier _ it
really chugs along, much like a traditional floppy.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect any speed improvements reading or writing to a
standard floppy, though. Floppies are just sluggish by nature.

UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA IS CREATING A FORENSIC MEDICINE CENTER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CINDY SWIRKO   
 The Gainesville (Fla.) Sun   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ Maggots can't communicate with humans. But
Bruce Goldberger can uncover secrets with maggots _ maybe even
unravel the mystery of a murder.
</P>
<P>
   The teeth from a corpse can't speak of whose mouth they once
filled, but Anthony Falsetti can make those teeth sing.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberger and Falsetti are key figures in the creation of a new
forensic medicine center at the University of Florida that they say
will be the first of its kind in the United States. Goldberger is a
professor in toxicology and Falsetti in anthropology.
</P>
<P>
   For years their interests have intersected in forensics, the use
of science in law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our two labs acted independently for several years'' Falsetti
said. ``We decided to bring together all the forensic sciences on
campus.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Goldberger, ``It's going to include forensic anthropology,
forensic toxicology and other specialities, including psychiatry,
dentistry, engineering, nursing, law, pathology.''
</P>
<P>
   Say a skeleton is found in a forest, which is not uncommon, and
police want to learn the story behind the bones. Who are they going
to call? A forensic expert, who tries to figure out who the person
was and how he died.
</P>
<P>
   Falsetti works with bones, but Goldberger works with the soft
stuff _ fluids and tissue _ to detect fatal toxins or poisons.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Goldberger doesn't even need human samples. Maggots
will do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just finished a case with maggots, which was very
interesting,'' Goldberger said. ``There was no tissue remaining _
just a small amount of muscle, and maggots. We tested both and
found drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldberger and Falsetti developed the proposal to create a
center named after William R. Maples, the late UF forensic
anthropologist noted nationwide for his work. The center has been
approved by the state Board of Regents and should begin next year.
</P>
<P>
   Formal programs in forensic medicine will be drawn from
anthropology, pathology, nursing, dentistry and others. Eventually,
a master's program will be created.
</P>
<P>
   Research will look at the length of time illegal drugs remain in
bone, ways to detect drugs, the effect wildlife has on destroying
or scattering remains, the effectiveness of ground-penetrating
radar in locating remains and three-dimensional imaging for facial
reproductions.
</P>
<P>
   Courses, seminars and other programs for forensic specialists,
medical examiners and police will also be available. Center
employees will be available to police departments, communities and
other groups who need forensic expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Other universities offer courses and degrees in forensic
sciences that deal with the collection and examination of evidence,
such as bullets or explosive devices. Some also offer courses in
forensic medicine, but the UF master's degree may be the first in
the country in forensic medicine. The degree could lead to a job in
a wide range of fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could be an anthropologist or toxicologist. They could
also be a death investigator. They could be the manager of a
medical examiner's office. They could assist in autopsies, they
could work in crime labs, police departments _ it could go on and
on,'' Goldberger said.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Kiser is director of certification and member services
for the American College of Forensic Examiners, an association of
forensic professionals with 15,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   Kiser said full-fledged degree programs in forensics are rare.
She added that growth in potential jobs for graduates is high.
</P>
<P>
   ``The field is always growing, but there are not many
universities that teach forensics,'' Kiser said. ``Forensics
crosses all the fields. People are fascinated with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Falsetti and Goldberger said some of that fascination is spurred
by movies and television.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberger has a picture of Dana Scully, one of two FBI agents
who work creepy cases in ``The X-Files,'' a television series.
Goldberger said Scully has inspired potential students, but a job
like her's is as rare as the alien remains autopsied on the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get silly calls from people asking how they can be a
medical doctor, a special agent, work for the FBI and investigate X
files,'' Goldberger said. ``It has drawn a lot of interest, but the
characters are total fiction.''

INTERNET CAN HELP WITH TURKEY
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 By LONNIE BROWN   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With Thanksgiving a week from Thursday, it's not too early to
begin looking for recipes and other holiday traditions.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of mine remembers one tradition well. ``The definition
of eternity,'' he reminds me each year about this time, ``is two
people and a turkey.''
</P>
<P>
   Better Homes and Gardens magazine, for the fourth year now, is
featuring its Thanksgiving Survival Guide on its Web site
(www.bhg.com). To go directly to the Thanksgiving pages:
www.bhg.com/food/holiday. America Online members can type AOL
Keyword: BHG, then click on the Thanksgiving link.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more useful features is the roasting guide that
allows users to select the time they want to have dinner ready and
then see what time they'll need to start the turkey, beef or pork
roasting.
</P>
<P>
   Users will also learn that eternity is about the amount of time
needed to defrost a frozen turkey. BHG recommends four days in the
refrigerator for even a modest one of 10 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The roasting guide has been expanded this year to include beef,
pork, lamb and veal. There are new recipes, too, including ones for
crockery cooking. Cooking classes for cookies and candy making not
only include recipes, but step-by-step instructions, photos and
videos as well. In addition, the site offers ideas for dressing up
store-bought cookies. There are also recipes for old-time fudge,
peanut brittle and peanut butter balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thanksgiving Survival Guide, improved again this year, is
one of our most widely-used features, and helps our readers prepare
delicious, yet simple, holiday meals,'' said Jean LemMon, the
magazine's editor. ``With this kind of planning help and creative
holiday ideas, you can count on spending more of your time relaxing
and enjoying the holiday with family and friends.''
</P>
<P>
   If you need help beyond timing the turkey, BHG offers a menu
planner to let users select their favorite appetizers, breads,
vegetables, salads, main dishes and desserts.
</P>
<P>
   Lazier than that? There are preplanned meals (with two diabetic
selections) and menus for six, 12 or 20 people.
</P>
<P>
   The recipes not only can be printed, but the site will create a
shopping list of ingredients needed, organized by grocery sections.
A calendar shows make-ahead steps that can be done in preparation
to take some of the pressure off Thanksgiving day.
</P>
<P>
   Message boards on ``holiday traditions'' and ``holiday cooking''
let cooks exchange ideas on those subjects. Other message groups
include ones on healthy cooking, quick meal ideas and baking.
</P>
<P>
   The site features new articles each weekday and offers special
holiday and seasonal sections. It is designed to offer BHG
magazine's 35 million readers additional information on articles,
as well as augment material featured on the BHG television program.
</P>
<P>
   Cruising
</P>
<P>
   For those planning a holiday cruise, a visit to icruise.com
(www.icruise.com) will prove helpful. The site, said a company
spokesman, is ``the most complete cruise ship database ever
assembled online,'' offering exclusive cruise packages and a
``best-price'' search engine that helps pick out the lowest travel
fares available.
</P>
<P>
   The company was originally established in 1998 to provide cruise
information to travel agents on a subscription basis. But in
September, the company began offering information and travel
packages directly to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The site has listings for nearly 150 cruise ships leaving from
more than 50 ports to nearly 2,000 worldwide destinations. Users
can designate their preferences for activities, facilities,
services and dining options while searching for cruises. The
best-price search allows users to select ships, sailing dates and
cabin categories.
</P>
<P>
   A review section offers independent reviews and ratings from
CruiseReports on dining, staff profiles, service, port reviews and
feedback from cruise passengers.

 &HT;    TRANSPLANT CENTERS SET FOR REGULATORY 'TRIAGE'
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Transplant centers that have resisted government
attempts to regulate traffic in human organs weighed their options
Friday after an agreement that appeared to lift much of Congress's
opposition to the rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to move on,'' said Robert Spieldenner, a spokesman for
the United Network for Organ Sharing, a nonprofit organization made
up of representatives from hospitals that perform transplants,
tissue typing laboratories and donor and recipient networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to prepare, because if it does go into effect in such
a short time frame, we have to be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 68,000 Americans are on waiting lists for heart, lung,
kidney and liver transplants. The new rule would dramatically
change the way the limited number of available organs are
allocated.
</P>
<P>
   The regulation is an outgrowth of more that a year of
negotiations involving the Clinton administration, transplant
centers with often opposing interests, and members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement between Health and Human Services Secretary Donna
Shalala and House Appropriations Committee Chairman C.W. Bill
Young, R-Fla., Thursday cleared much, but not all, of the
opposition to increased government regulation.
</P>
<P>
   It would force broader sharing of transplant organs, primarily
livers, and give Shalala's department final authority over
allocation policies. It would go into effect within six weeks after
Congress approves a federal budget for the department.
</P>
<P>
   The organ sharing network has resisted the new allocation
system. In general, the rule would make organs available in wider
areas and increase the priority afforded to patients in greatest
need.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the agreement, opposition remained in some congressional
offices.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., a week ago introduced a bill that
would prevent what Sessions called ``an unprecedented takeover of
our nation's transplant system by HHS.'' Sessions said he had 26
co-sponsors in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   A companion bill has been introduced in the House.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of concern about organ transplant equity is the
human liver, Spieldenner said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, around 4,500 human livers were available for
transplant. More than 12,000 patients waited to receive liver
transplants.
</P>
<P>
   However, since a liver must be put into a recipient's body
within 12 hours or the chances of the operation succeeding drop
dramatically, transplant networks have had a tendency to approve
recipients who wait in a hospital relatively near the one where the
donor died, he said.
</P>
<P>
   This has caused the national shortage to be felt most acutely in
those hospitals that perform large numbers of transplants _ such as
those at medical schools at the University of Pittsburgh, the
University of Miami, the University of Nebraska and the University
of California, Los Angeles, all of which perform from 100 to 300
transplants a year.
</P>
<P>
   These centers have been agitating for wider distribution
networks that would to some degree relieve their shortages. And a
report by the Institute of Medicine four months ago said the system
often results in persons who are less ill receiving organs sooner
than more severely ill patients served by different networks.
</P>
<P>
   The same shortages cause less contentious problems for opposite
reasons with respect to hearts, lungs and kidneys, Spieldenner
said. Kidneys can be preserved for up to 48 or even 72 hours, and
therefore shipped farther. Hearts and lungs can be kept only about
six hours, so there is little hope of sending them to patients
farther away.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute of Medicine also said transplant centers that
serve larger numbers of recipients have greater success than
smaller centers.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Hudgins, director of regulatory studies at the
Libertarian-leaning Cato Institute, which opposes virtually all
government regulation, said allocation of organs should be left to
private decision makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, when something is commercialized, it becomes more
accessible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that with advances in the science of
``xenotransplantation,'' in which animal organs may someday be
placed in human bodies, the shortage problem could disappear in a
few years ``and the government will be in place to regulate that
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Only about 50 animal organs have ever been transplanted into
humans, and all the recipients died.

OLIVER STONE'S NEW WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Nov. 14) 
(bl) 
 By BRUCE NEWMAN  
 &HT;     
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA MONICA, Calif. _ Before the 1972 Super Bowl, President
Richard M. Nixon drew up a pass play for the Miami Dolphins and
gave it to the team's coach, Don Shula. Nixon had lately been
directing the retreat of U.S. forces from Vietnam, but was sure he
had a winner this time. The Dolphins waited only eight plays to run
the pattern against the Dallas Cowboys, resulting in an incomplete
pass and contributing to a humiliating 24-3 loss. Two and a half
years later, Nixon resigned from office in disgrace.
</P>
<P>
   Like Nixon, Oliver Stone could hardly wait to send a play into
the big game. He began collecting pro football cards when he was
10, living all alone on the fourth floor of an enormous home on New
York's East 64th Street that he shared with his father, a
stockbroker, and his French-born mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was an only child, a lonely child,'' Stone says. ``I used to
play in my little room. I called it the green room, because the
floor was green and the wallpaper was green. I had a bunk bed, and
I liked to sleep on the bottom of the bunk bed. I don't know why.''
</P>
<P>
   There he was _ an only child, a lonely child _ on his upper
floor, the empty bunk looming over him at night like a dark cloud.
And in his solitude, he would fan out the football cards from his
collection in intricate formations, and transform his garret into a
clamorous stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would play a game, a very concentrated game on this green
field _ my rug _ with the football cards _ 11 on 11,'' Stone
recalls. ``I devised an entire system of football, with books. I
had every team written down. And I kept logs, as only an obsessed
child might. Page after page.''
</P>
<P>
   As Nixon and the boy who would one day become his rebarbative
five o'clock shadow both understood, football is simply war by
other means. To illustrate this potent 1970s metaphor, now comes
``Any Given Sunday,'' Stone's film about pro football, which opens
Dec. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the movie's concussive force, it will be difficult to
improve on the assault that Nixon unleashed on North Vietnam as his
aerial follow-up to the Super Bowl debacle, a 40,000-ton rain of
bombs tellingly called ``Linebacker Two.'' Nixon knew his target
audience. The question is, does Stone know his?
</P>
<P>
   Three of his last four pictures _ ``Heaven and Earth,''
``Nixon'' and ``U-Turn''_ failed at the box office, and even his
two incendiary triumphs, ``JFK''and ``Natural Born Killers,'' left
Stone with a constituency so limited _ Doom-playing, drug-bingeing,
anomie-addled assassination theorists and 12-step conspiracists _
that it was uncertain whether he could draw a crowd anywhere
outside second-gunman chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   He was making documentaries from his own fevered dreams, making
history, and making it up as he went along, too. When he ran into
difficulty finding studio backing for ``Memphis,'' his
reinterpretation of the events leading up to the assassination of
Martin Luther King Jr., he decided to give up challenging
historical orthodoxies.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Stone came very close to making ``Mission: Impossible
2,'' before he came to his senses and dropped out to play his
football card.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever else ``Any Given Sunday'' may be, it is not least
Stone's attempt to plant his flag in the commercial mainstream.
Bomb-throwing is a young man's game. ``It doesn't excite my passion
to unveil corruption anymore,'' he says. ``It's apparent everywhere
around us, it's just part of life. I realize I can't do anything
about it. It's there, it's always going to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Defending his films _ defending himself _ through the storms of
controversy he has sailed into has left Stone with scars that he
wears like ribbons. ``I died more than once on `JFK,''' he says.
``It became a question of, `Are you anti-conspiracy? Are you
pro-conspiracy?' Unfortunately, we tend to polarize issues rather
than debate them. Where has the middle gone?''
</P>
<P>
   This question seems especially poignant, coming from Oliver
Stone. He is 53 now, and his own middle is more evident, a
softening fleshiness having settled in everywhere but the brittle
almond eyes. During an interview at his office, he holds out his
hands to show the scars from an attack by a knife-wielding robber,
who cut Stone while he was living in the East Village, studying at
New York University's film school after coming home from Army duty
in Vietnam. And there are the scars he got taking out a Vietcong
gun nest (for which he won the Purple Heart and a Bronze Star) _
would you like to see those?
</P>
<P>
   There is something disorienting about this: that these wounds
opened three decades ago remain so raw. He had hurried to enlist in
1967, knowing the war would not last forever; he could not wait to
get to Vietnam, to prove to his father that he was ``a man, not a
boy.'' Thirty years later, he still seems reluctant to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Stone doesn't mind playing the part of the Brilliant Weirdo. He
is so exquisitely aware of his own myth that he always seems to be
standing slightly outside of it, watching to see how the customers
react. When a reporter arrived from The Washington Post several
years ago to discuss his film ``Nixon,'' Stone asked: ``Why do they
hate me so much? Do you think it's me they hate _ or my work?''
</P>
<P>
   Much of this anguish is heartfelt, as if Stone were constantly
abraded by unseen furies. He lashes out at ``liars'' in the media
who want to ``destroy'' him. One of these specimens has printed an
incorrect release date for ``Any Given Sunday.'' ``He knows the
truth, and yet still he lies,'' Stone says of this transgression.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way that Stone sees politics as inherently
Shakespearean, he views football as operatic. (He has already
boasted in an interview that ``Any Given Sunday'' will be to
football what ``The Godfather'' was to gangsters: an epic aria.)
``I think it has all the American elements,'' the director says.
``Violence, guts, blue-collar linemen, the green earth, the worms,
the Indian drums, the moccasins. The grunting and the groaning and
the fighting. It is a war, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Like the portentous quotations that open many of his films,
``Any Given Sunday'' picks at the question of what it is to be a
man, Stone's central preoccupation. His films are friezes of
hot-blooded, hyper-masculine men and chilly women who exist mostly
as chalk outlines.
</P>
<P>
   This sort of testosterone-fueled masculinism is not unknown
among violent auteurs like Sam Peckinpah, who dispatched men and
women with equal fury. ``Even with Peckinpah there was more sex,
more attraction between men and women, than there is with Oliver
Stone,'' says Molly Haskell, a critic who has written extensively
about women in film. ``I think he's unusual in that respect, in
having really virtually no women's roles. Try to imagine him
adapting Jane Austen or Edith Wharton. It's inconceivable.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Hollywood's great directors have shared Stone's macho
predilections, but because the studios kept as many women as men
under contract, movies in the 1930s and '40s treated women as part
of the human equation.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Hawks so adored women that he paid them the highest
compliment he could imagine: he hired actresses to play men. In
``His Girl Friday,'' Hawks' 1940 remake of ``The Front Page,''
Rosalind Russell was actually playing a role originated by Pat
O'Brien. But women like Jean Arthur in ``Only Angels Have Wings,''
Joanne Dru in ``Red River'' and Barbara Stanwyck in ``Ball of
Fire'' _ women who were more lip than lipstick _ were a rarity in
their time.
</P>
<P>
   Stone takes a page from the Hawks playbook in ``Any Given
Sunday'' by making Christina Pagniacci, the owner of the Miami
Sharks (played by Cameron Diaz), one of the most brutish characters
in the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about sports that brings men together and
their passions are excited,'' Stone says. ``It's a thing I know
because I do have hair on my body, and I have masculine qualities.
But that doesn't mean I'm all masculine, that through
reincarnations, dreams, fantasies, you can't be a woman too.'' In
Christina, he has found his altered ego, freshly depilated.
</P>
<P>
   The more vulnerable, self-pitying figure in ``Any Given Sunday''
is Coach Tony D'Amato, who is Stone's stalking horse this time out.
``I have sweated blood for these men,'' says the coach, played by
Al Pacino. ``Given up my wife, my children for these men. I've
given up everything I have for these men. Games are all that
matters to me, because that is pure, it's sane. Life isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone's own life hasn't always been pure either. In August, he
was sentenced to three years' probation and ordered into counseling
after being arrested with hashish in his possession for the second
time.
</P>
<P>
   His wars may be over, but Stone soldiers on. Actors who worked
on ``Any Given Sunday'' talk of having had their ``manhood
challenged,'' as one put it, and of being surrounded on the set by
beautiful women spectators, who were constantly coming and going.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Foxx, the young actor who plays the Sharks' quarterback,
Willie Beamen, said, being a football player under Stone was like
being led into battle. ``It was a nice Vietnam,'' he said. ``Only
we were in Miami, so the enemy was the women.''
</P>
<P>
   This is just as it has been since Stone's breakthrough film,
``Salvador,'' in which a photographer played by James Woods tells
his friend (James Belushi) that American women are not to be
trusted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latin women, now, they're totally different,'' he explains.
``They're kind, they're understanding. . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   But Belushi's character cuts him off. ``Best thing about Latin
women,'' he says, ``is they don't speak English.''
</P>
<P>
   In the wildly autobiographical novel he published two years ago,
``A Child's Night Dream,'' Stone writes of his hero _ who is named
Oliver Stone _ dreaming of sexual ecstasies with his mother, who is
French. ``And it was my mother's face staring down at me,'' he
writes in one passage, ``as she was doing this to me and me to her,
both of us entwined like snakes of desire.'' Then comes the
transforming moment of consummation: ``O how thrilling! How
exciting! Against all rules! All flags!''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the author of this weren't also the director of ``JFK,''
it would be difficult to know how to take the dream. But something
happened to shape Stone's view of women, and of himself. ``It was
very bizarre, as a boy, to be introduced to women through my
mother,'' he says now. ``And these women were predatorily sexy.
What could I do? I didn't know what to do, didn't have the first
clue. I was a ghost. That's why I went to Vietnam. I couldn't have
an identity, I didn't know who I was. I was the invisible man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't able to do anything about it,'' he adds. ``I wasn't
experienced. I was scared of women, I was very scared. To some
degree, I guess we all still are, because they can be pretty
scary.''
</P>
<P>
   He tries to laugh at this, but instead he trills something
strained and high-pitched _ a giggle _ and suddenly he is 10 again,
thinking dreamily about the green room, the football cards, the
safety of his bottom bunk. ``Especially American women,'' he says
finally.

 &HT;    `Native Lands' presents Ga. before Europeans
 &HT;    By Jill Young Miller
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta History Center charts new territory today
with its first major exhibition devoted to Native Americans who
once thrived in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in Atlanta, and I found ... there seemed to be very
little consciousness of the role Native Americans have played,''
said Sarah Hill, guest curator of ``Native Lands: Indians and
Georgia.'' The exhibition explores Mississippian, Creek and
Cherokee cultures in an ambitious effort to, as Hill said,
``restore this broken history.''
</P>
<P>
   A panel of Creek and Cherokee Indians, whose ancestors were
evicted from Georgia, served as advisers on the project. They will
gather today for the exhibition's opening, where they'll tell
stories, demonstrate basketry, bead working, mask carving and
perform traditional songs and dances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope to educate people more about the Muscogee way of
life,'' said storyteller Joyce Bear, a Creek cultural preservation
officer with the Muscogee Nation of Oklahoma. ``Most people think
that once we were driven out of Georgia, we ceased to exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Before European settlers came to what is now Georgia, Native
Americans lived across the land. The Mississippians, who flourished
from about 900 to 1500, built ceremonial mounds and surrounded them
with their towns, some with populations in the thousands. Whole
towns died of disease contracted from Europeans in the 16th
century.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1700s, many of the Mississippians' surviving
descendants had joined a group called the Creek Confederacy and
lived throughout most of what is now Georgia. Another group of
Native Americans, the Cherokees, lived in the southern
Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Native Lands'' explores the cultures _ and what happened to
them _ in a circular exhibit with videos and significant pieces
collected from around the country. One of the finest items is a
Cherokee deerskin coat trimmed with red trade cloth and red
buttons, from about 1800, on loan from the Smithsonian
Institution's National Museum of the American Indian. At the time,
Cherokee men wore coats cut like European shirts.
</P>
<P>
   The original treaties that signed away Indian land in Georgia
also are on display; they're on loan from the National Archives. In
a case nearby is the knife that was used to kill a man who betrayed
the Cherokees by signing.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia and the federal government forced the Creeks and
Cherokees to leave their native lands and move west. By 1825, the
Creek Nation had been evicted. The discovery of gold in 1929 on
Cherokee land provided whites with another reason to drive out the
Indians. In 1838, U.S. troops rounded up the Cherokees and forced
them west. Many of them died on the infamous Trail of Tears. By
1840, almost no Creek or Cherokee people remained in Georgia. Today
their descendants live in Alabama, North Carolina and Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition is sponsored in part by the National Endowment
for the Humanities and runs through Jan. 1, 2001. A smaller version
then will travel to Indian reservations around the country.

 &HT;    Maxim Group loses money on carpet outlet turnarounds
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ High operating costs at Maxim Group caused the floor
covering retailer to lose money in the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Delayed by its restatement of fiscal 1999 earnings, Maxim
released its results for the first and second quarters on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The second-quarter loss fell to $2.7 million, or 14 cents a
share, from a loss of $21.6 million, or $1.32 a share, in the
year-earlier period. Revenue rose to $202.5 million from $95.6
million.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter, Maxim's loss after charges was $800,000,
or 4 cents a share, compared with net income of $1.3 million, or 8
cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $192.6 million from
$96.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   The retailer continues to struggle to turn around
underperforming stores it acquired from Shaw Industries. Maxim
operates 1,000 carpet outlets, including 323 owned by the company,
under several nameplates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first half of this year was consumed with the problems we
have with operational efficiency,'' said Tom Leahey, executive vice
president of finance.
</P>
<P>
   Cost reductions this year have ``stabilized'' the company as it
regroups from expenses associated with the restatement of fiscal
1999 earnings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The restatement spurred a lengthy forensic audit that cost the
company $4 million. The second quarter included a related charge
for $2.7 million. The remainder will be expensed in the third
quarter, Leahey said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Maxim faces $2.7 million in settlement costs in a
tentative agreement with bondholders to waive a technical default.
Last year, the company repurchased more of its own shares than was
allowed by terms of the 9.25 percent bonds, issued in October 1997
and maturing in 2007. The default led auditors to question the
company's ``ability to continue as a going concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Maxim has offered to purchase at least $40 million of the bonds
at 102 percent of face value. About $95 million of the bonds remain
outstanding. Holders of the outstanding bonds would receive a
``consent fee'' of $50 for every $1,000 of principal they hold. The
interest rate on the bonds would increase to 12.75 percent from
9.25 percent. The consent fee would cure the default, Leahey said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Nov.12 (States News Service) -- As Congress wraps up
legislative business for the century, space-related bills are being
held up by political bargaining tactics.
</P>
<P>
   With the president and Congress now on the tail end of prolonged
budget negotiations, time is running out for bills that extend
launch indemnification and offer federally-backed loans to
commercial launch companies.
</P>
<P>
   These two bills have been delayed for months because senators
have blocked their consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Senate often votes by unanimous consent to move
quickly through legislation, senators can block a vote either by
withholding their consent, or tacking on unrelated and often
controversial amendments to advance their own agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senators are holding things up for unrelated [to space]
reasons,'' said House Science committee spokesman Jeff Lungren.
``One senator can tie things up _ and they move on to other
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., and now Herb Kohl, D-Wis., have
prevented a vote on a Senate plan to extend by five years
indemnification for commercial launch companies. Indemnification
ensures the government will cover any potential damage costs to a
third-party from a malfunctioning launch vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is pending for action on unanimous consent, but Senator
Kohl has held up all [such] agreements,'' said Senate Commerce
committee spokeswoman Pia Pialorsi.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl forced the hold until a contentious dairy compact is
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The existing indemnification law, aimed at encouraging firms to
develop launch capabilities and get insurance, was initially set to
expire on Dec. 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But lawmakers managed to put off dealing with the renewal in
October by slipping a one-year extension of the indemnification
into the VA-HUD spending bill, which the president signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives us a little bit of breathing room,'' Lungren said.
``[But] pretty much everyone would like to get this done as soon as
possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers who care about the bill, including its sponsor,
presidential candidate Sen. John McCain, D-Ariz., will want to move
quickly on it when Congress reconvenes, Lungren predicts.
</P>
<P>
   Another pending measure, which would speed up the application
process for export licenses for commercial satellites, has stalled
over controversial provisions about abortion and family planning
latched on to the bill.
</P>
<P>
   A House-Senate conference to work out the satellite provision,
part of a State Department spending bill, is hung up on the
abortion issues, Lungren said. The export control issue is a
primary concern of satellite makers and users.
</P>
<P>
   Another plan left hanging, a bill to offer federally-backed
loans to private space launch companies, had won broad support in
Congress and industry earlier this fall. But this bill was not even
actively blocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just not one that, in light of everything going on
with the budget and appropriations bills, got that far down the
pipeline,'' a Senate aide familiar with the bill said.
</P>
<P>
   Drafted by Sen. John Breaux, D-La., the plan would offer $500
million in loan guarantees to qualified launch companies, which
could trigger as much as $5 billion in loans, according to Breaux.
</P>
<P>
   A bill to bar NASA from transferring funds for Russia's work on
the International Space Station as long as the country continues
giving weapons technology to Iran is also nowhere near the
president's desk.
</P>
<P>
   Bills that are not passed by the time Congress goes home for the
holidays-probably later this month-will have another year before
they would expire.

TEACHER ASSAULTED AFTER CONFISCATING POKEMAN CARDS

<P>
   LAKELAND, Fla. _ A seventh-grader was charged with a felony and
may be expelled from school after he attacked a teacher who
confiscated the boy's Pokemon trading cards.
</P>
<P>
   The Polk County School Board on Tuesday will consider whether to
expel Gabriel Cruz Sosa for the remainder of this school year and
for all of 2000-2001, said Greg Bondurant, director of discipline
and security for the Polk County School District.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-year-old student at Sleepy Hill Middle School was charged
with battery on a school board employee, a third-degree felony,
according to a Lakeland Police Department report.
</P>
<P>
   The student violated the school's ban on the popular
Japanese-character game. He became upset when teacher Brian
Bridges, 29, took the cards, the police report says.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel ``charged the teacher, pushed him and choked him ... and
tried to run out,'' according to a report filed by Principal Ann
Tankson. He was suspended after the Nov. 2 incident pending School
Board action, Bondurant said.
</P>
<P>
   Bondurant said the recommendation is to expel the boy for more
than a year because he intentionally assaulted a teacher. Usually
when a student hits a school employee, it happens when the adult is
trying to break up a fight among students.
</P>
<P>
   Sleepy Hill is not the only school to ban the cards, which are
part of a franchise of TV shows, games, videos, books and a movie
that opened Wednesday and has taken the under-12 set by storm.
Tankson wrote parents at the beginning of the school year
explaining that the cards would be confiscated and given back only
to parents at the end of the semester.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Before mountains of candy, Miss Peppermint Twist,
wearing hot pink chiffon and white fur, announced to a bevy of
bouncing ponytails that they might take one ounce of candy each.
</P>
<P>
   Then Miss Twist corrected herself. ``Oh, did I say `one ounce'?
Excuse me, I mean one pound.'' She twirled in her lifesaver-covered
tutu. ``You  &UR; do &LR;  need nourishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen girls squealed with glee and filled plastic bags with as
much nourishment as they could grab.
</P>
<P>
   So, you are a 12-year-old girl who asks to have your very best
friends sleep over for your birthday. Your parents agree and rent
out all of FAO Schwarz to fulfill your heart's desire. And that is
how Maggie, a seventh grader from Miami, one baby sister and 13
other girls came to have a slumber party last Saturday night in the
mother of all toy stores on Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   It was a cross between Eloise's romp at the Plaza and a
game-show contestant's running down store aisles and filling up
shopping carts against a clock.
</P>
<P>
   Starting at 9 p.m., after the three-floor store had closed to
the public, the girls were greeted by Professor Perry Winkle and
Tabitha Teazlebee, their adult hosts, dressed as safari leaders in
pith helmets and khaki. They gave each girl a survival kit with
knapsack, camera, water bottle and talking watch, which burped and
made other unmentionable sounds.
</P>
<P>
   The nightlong gigglefest began.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 11 hours, the girls snacked on pizza; conducted a
scavenger hunt for Pokemon Power Bouncers and other toys on the
overflowing shelves; tattooed their arms; had their hair braided
with beads; made ID bracelets; sat in a photo booth to make
stickers; and, best of all, were allowed to touch, try on and wear
whatever pink, leopard or purple dress, shoe or boa they fancied
anywhere in the store. At 8 a.m. on Sunday morning, after bagels
and cream cheese, they were presented with $100 gift certificates
to shop before the store opened to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who could ever have an experience like this?'' said Alana, the
birthday girl's sister, 8. ``I mean after tonight I can walk by FAO
Schwarz, look over and say, `I slept there.' Who could ever say
that?''
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, a growing number of children can in this
peppermint-flavored, pink-fizz economy, where extravagant
children's parties are a recurring theme. The price for FAO
Schwarz's Ultimate Slumber Party, $17,500 for 15 children, is no
deterrent. It was introduced a year ago, and the next open Saturday
night is in April. Last week, a slumber party the store donated to
a charity auction conducted by Rosie O'Donnell was bought for
$18,000 by Frank and Kathie Lee Gifford.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning on ``Live With Regis and Kathie Lee,'' Ms.
Gifford mentioned that her children, Cody and Cassidy, would soon
be having their slumber party, and she joked about whether she and
her husband would join them. She must not have heard about the
no-parents rule.
</P>
<P>
   Writers about raising children may preach modesty in birthday
parties or advise inviting one guest for each year celebrated; but
all over New York, parents are ignoring them. ``We have never been
busier,'' said Chuck Santoro, a k a Professor Winkle, who with his
partner, Liz Nagengast, a k a Ms. Teazlebee, runs In Tandem
Productions, which puts on elaborate children's parties. Besides
playing host to the FAO Schwarz parties, they offer Madeline
brunches for girls and Batman brunches for boys at the Four Seasons
Hotel for about $4,000.
</P>
<P>
   The American Museum of Natural History lets members have
birthday parties among its exhibits for $1,500 and up. There are
party packages at the Warner Brothers store on 57th Street, at
Wollman Memorial Rink in Central Park and at Chelsea Piers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are spending more money than they ever have for kids
that are younger and younger,'' said Katherine Wyse Goldman, author
of ``New York's 50 Best Places to Have a Kids Party'' (City &AMP; Co.,
$12), which lists plenty of inexpensive settings, too, like Miss
Majesty's Lollipop Playhouse on Grove Street, where tickets are $8.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Samalin, an author of child-raising books, who holds
workshops for parents in Manhattan, is appalled by the trend toward
excess. ``A child doesn't need 15 gifts or 15 parties,'' she said.
``A child needs a parent that will spend time with him. The message
you're sending your little darling is so far-fetched. It's sending
a totally messed up sense of values, totally mixed-up idea of how
they should deal with money.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever could she mean?
</P>
<P>
   Santoro told about a party for which the mother asked that her
Park Avenue penthouse be cleared out to create a carnival space,
complete with motorcycle ride, for her son, 3, who loved
motorcycles. ``She told us to do anything we needed to do to create
the carnival,'' he said. ``Even if it meant breaking down the
doorway to get in the motorcycle.'' (He found a small one.)
</P>
<P>
   Maggie's father defended his gift to his daughter, a combination
birthday and bat mitzvah present. ``Maggie barely asks for
anything,'' he said. ``When she found out about this and asked for
it, we were shocked. We just had to give it to her.''
</P>
<P>
   He is an entrepreneur who owns restaurants and clothing
factories in New York and Israel. He agreed to let a reporter and
photographer attend Maggie's party on condition that the family's
last name not appear, to protect his daugther's privacy and because
he did not wish to be criticized for excessiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Maggie, a sweet, unassuming girl, lived until recently in
Scarsdale, N.Y. She moved with her mother to Miami after her
parents' divorce. As her friends, most of whom attend Salanter
Akiba Riverdale Academy, a Hebrew day school in Riverdale, the
Bronx, frolicked through the store, she took pictures. She said the
party wasn't as extravagant as her brother's bar mitzvah, when the
family rented Madison Square Garden so guests could play
basketball. (The Knicks were away.)
</P>
<P>
   Maggie and her friends were well mannered. Not like some other
children Professor Winkle and Ms. Teazlebee recalled. There was one
boy of 13, he said, playing in the radio-controlled car pit on the
lower level, who asked, ``Are we going to really sleep down here,
because I don't get good reception on my cell?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Teazlebee chimed in, ``And let's talk about the boy who
didn't think a $100 certificate was enough.''
</P>
<P>
   When the girls returned from the scavenger hunt, Professor
Winkle (that is, Santoro, who also reports on the hot toy of the
week as Toy Boy on Z-100 radio) gave his predictions for the
holiday season's blockbuster toys. His top picks were Street
Flyers, sneakers that convert to roller skates; Wuvvies,
interactive cuddly creatures that give birth; the Barbie I-Zone
camera, a Polaroid that takes sticker pictures; and a singing
Brittany Spears doll.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want all of them,'' Nicole squealed.
</P>
<P>
   At 1:35 a.m., the girls sat on the floor having their nails
done, put glitter on their faces and made vanilla-scented bath gel.
In the corner, there was one casualty, Kiki Daddona, 12, who fell
asleep in a chair.
</P>
<P>
   By 3:45 a.m., most were in pajamas. Flannel pajama bottoms from
Old Navy seemed to be the most popular. So did big animal slippers.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``Star Wars'' Phantom Menace Shop, the guests were given
flannel sleeping bags (to keep) and laid them on the linoleum
floor. Professor Winkle, in pajamas, a leopard smoking jacket and a
fez, cued up a DVD of ``Never Been Kissed'' with Drew Barrymore on
a huge screen.
</P>
<P>
   As the movie played, girls cuddled in their bags, but Kiki, who
had napped earlier, slipped past the ``Star Wars'' action figures
to explore on her own. Professor Winkle hunted her down and brought
her back to the campsite.

 &HT;    Official: Water war truce talks sinking
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ President Clinton's appointee to the committee
negotiating a settlement in the water war among Georgia and Alabama
and Florida warned the states Friday that the talks appear to be
headed for failure.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay Thomas, a former Georgia congressman and head of the
state Chamber of Commerce, said that the complexities of the water
dispute and unyielding demands from various groups for more water
may doom the negotiations. Negotiators have been trying for nearly
two years to craft a regional water-management plan to divide up
the waters of the Chattahoochee and other rivers shared by the
three states.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this late date (in the negotiations), a failure to reach an
agreement is a very real possibility,'' Thomas said at a
negotiation session in Atlanta on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, he said, the states may be headed for ``long,
costly and arbitrary litigation'' in federal court, and they would
forfeit ``a great opportunity'' to determine their own destinies
over water. ``This dispute could be settled by a federal judge who
has never seen these river basins and who does not know of the very
important roles these basins play in these states,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, who represents nine federal agencies at the negotiating
table, is a nonvoting member of the committee deliberating over a
water war agreement. However, he has the power to veto any
settlement the negotiators may reach if the decision adversely
affects the agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, Alabama and Florida are squabbling over the
Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint river basin, and Georgia and
Alabama are squaring off over the Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa river
basin. The headwaters of both basins are in Georgia. The states are
trying to come up with water sharing formulas for each basin by
Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia wants enough water to sustain metro Atlanta's projected
growth over the next 30 to 50 years. Alabama wants adequate water
supplies to fuel its own growth, and Florida wants to be assured of
enough water coming down the Apalachicola (formed by the
conjunction of the Chattahoochee and Flint) to nourish its Gulf
Coast oyster industry.
</P>
<P>
   In between, several groups are demanding enough water to meet
their own specific needs. They include farmers in southwest Georgia
who are worried that metro Atlanta's growing reliance on the Flint
River will rob them of water for irrigation; commercial barge
operators on the lower Chattahoochee who are concerned there won't
be enough water to float their vessels; and environmental groups
who say that more water for people and industries will leave less
water for fish and other aquatic creatures.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said that if the groups are not willing to relent on some
of their demands, a water war settlement may be doomed. The various
groups ``will not go quietly into the night,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Kerr, Georgia's chief negotiator, said that Georgia is
``willing to share the pain.'' He said Thomas's remarks brought
``wisdom, insight and perhaps some proper chastisement.''
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's negotiation session, which dealt only with the ACF,
Georgia and Florida made little headway on agreeing how much water
should flow from Georgia into Florida during droughts. A
negotiation meeting for the ACT is scheduled for Monday in Atlanta.

AMBITIOUS INTERLOPER OR WELCOME PRESENCE? A LATINO SCHOLAR ANSWERS
CRITICS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Texas, N.C.)   By LYNDA RICHARDSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMHERST, MASS. _ Ilan Stavchansky Slomianski has come a long way
from the secluded, middle-class Jewish enclave of Mexico City where
he grew up. There Ilan, the son of a popular Mexican soap opera
star, attended Yiddish day school and celebrated the high holidays
in synagogue. Other kids called him El Guerito (Little Blondie).
</P>
<P>
   Now El Guerito is known as Ilan Stavans (his father's stage
name) and is a widely published writer and editor and one of the
most influential figures in Latino literature in the United States.
When W.W. Norton, the foremost publisher of literary canons, wanted
someone to produce a major anthology on Latino writing two years
ago, it selected the 38-year-old Stavans, a professor of Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   To some Latino experts, Stavans is a welcome presence who is
creating excitement about a long overlooked field of writing. To
others, he is an ambitious interloper who is stealing attention
from more deserving and seasoned scholars.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's becoming the czar of Latino literature and culture,''
said Juan Flores, a professor of black and Puerto Rican studies at
Hunter College. ``This guy comes in, and he's the one who is the
spokesman, the canon-former who is making the ultimate decisions
about what is worthy of readership on the part of the American
audience. It's astounding the quick move to that kind of
prominence.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, Stavans says, he is what he is. ``I don't have any
apologies,'' he said in an interview in his office at Amherst
College, the only faculty office in the health center. Amid the
volumes by American essayist Edmund Wilson, the Peruvian poet
Octavio Paz and the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges sits a
photograph of his father dressed as a woman in a black wig, with
pursed lips, for a play like ``Cabaret.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people attack me because I wasn't born in the barrio,''
he said. ``I've been attacked for not being dark skinned and for
being young. If you paid attention to all this, you would be naked,
walking in the street, without a name and a telephone number.''
</P>
<P>
   Since he left Mexico in 1985, he has published more than a dozen
books on Hispanic culture in Latin America and the United States.
He proposed the Latino literary anthology right after Norton
published its anthology on African-American literature, which
became the fastest-selling anthology in the book publisher's
history. Norton took his suggestion, and the Latino anthology is
due out in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Stavans has several more works on the way, including
a memoir on language coming out next year, a dictionary on
Spanglish, the hodgepodge of Spanish and English, and a cartoon
history of Latinos in the United States. He is the editor of a book
series on Latin American Jewish literature and the editor in chief
of Hopscotch, a stylish new English-language magazine on Hispanic
culture and politics.
</P>
<P>
   He is ``more ambitious than 10 men and a mule,'' said Reynolds
Smith, the executive editor at Duke University Press, which
publishes Hopscotch.
</P>
<P>
   This prodigious output prompted The Chronicle of Higher
Education to label Stavans the emerging ``Skip Gates of Latino
studies,'' referring to Henry Louis Gates Jr., the ubiquitous
Harvard professor and chairman of the Afro-American studies
department who is co-editor of the Norton Anthology of
African-American Literature.
</P>
<P>
   It is a comparison that Stavans happily embraces. ``He manages
to combine academia with the public sphere in a way that I find
wonderful,'' said Stavans, fairly gushing. Stavans modeled
Hopscotch on Transition, a cheeky journal on black culture and
politics that was founded in Uganda in 1961 and resurrected by
Gates. Now, Gates is on Hopscotch's advisory board.
</P>
<P>
   Stavans' rapid rise to prominence, however, has chafed some
writers and scholars who regard him as a well-connected
opportunist; an arriviste with only a superficial knowledge of the
cultures on which he ruminates. His critics say that the Eastern
Establishment has anointed Stavans as a leading spokesman for
Latinos, whose complicated experiences he has not scrutinized
deeply.
</P>
<P>
   True, Stavans was writing Mexican detective novels and dabbling
in experimental film and theater in the 1970s and 1980s when many
Latino students and scholars in the United States were waging war
with college administrators to create Chicano and ethnic studies
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The controversy has been that he has come onto the Hispanic
literary picture fairly recently,'' said Francisco Lomeli, a
professor of Spanish and Portuguese and chairman of the Chicano
studies department at the University of California at Santa
Barbara. (He is also a consultant on the Norton anthology.)
Explaining the criticism, he said, ``People have worked so hard
against the grain, and to have somebody come in almost like a
character out of theater, deus ex machina, there's a little bit of
resentment.''
</P>
<P>
   Stavans admits that the complications of identity did not occur
to him when he was a fair-haired boy watching ``Star Trek'' on
television in Mexico City. It was not until he went to college
there that he realized how little he knew about his country. Then
he rejected his Jewish roots and went backpacking across Mexico and
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to have the least to do with Jews as possible,'' said
Stavans, a gentle-mannered man with wire-rimmed glasses. ``I wanted
to integrate and become Mexican.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stavans found that the more that he tried to become like
everyone else, the more he felt different. He dropped out of
college after two years to embark on a Hemingwayesque life as a
writer in Spain, England and Israel. He eventually returned to
Mexico City to complete his undergraduate studies in psychology,
appeasing parents who wanted him to have a backup if writing did
not succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Stavans was writing under his father's stage name when he moved
to New York in 1985. He enrolled at the Jewish Theological
Seminary, where he met his wife, Alison Sparks Stavchansky, who is
a speech pathologist. They have two young boys.
</P>
<P>
   He studied for his doctorate in Latin American literature at
Columbia University. There he wondered why so little attention was
paid to Latino writers in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   His approach to the question of Hispanic identity, however, has
not won admiration from some Latino scholars. Stavans said he
stresses the similarities among Hispanic groups rather than their
differences. That contrasts with a more confrontational approach
that emphasizes Latino ambivalence and even resistance to American
culture and history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Latinos are a separate nation in the U.S.,'' he
said. ``We are entering, belonging and sharing that melting pot
with many other minority groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Stavans' most widely taught book, ``The Hispanic Condition:
Reflections on Culture and Identity in America'' (HarperCollins,
1995), is his most controversial. While some reviewers called it a
useful primer on Latino culture, others like Flores said the book
made cosmic generalizations about Latinos and lacked rigorous
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Stavans said his views on Spain also put him at theoretical odds
with many old guard academics in Latin American studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been for many years resentment of Spain as the
conqueror, but a lot of things about modern Spain have changed,''
he said. ``We should talk about the Hispanic world as a much more
dynamic body made up of Spain, Latin America, the Spanish-speaking
Caribbean and Latinos in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   His withering assessment of some of the field's best-known
writers, like the novelist Sandra Cisneros, author of the acclaimed
book of related stories, ``The House on Mango Street,'' has also
irritated some of his colleagues. In Academic Questions, the
journal of the National Association of Scholars, three years ago,
Stavans asked why Ms. Cisneros had become ``the most sought-after
Latina writer of her generation and a guest impossible to ignore in
any multicultural fiesta.''
</P>
<P>
   Tey Diana Rebolledo, a professor of Spanish at the University of
New Mexico at Albuquerque who published an anthology of literature
of Mexican-American women, said Stavans panned Ms. Cisneros ``in
kind of nasty ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even those with mixed feelings about Stavans see his
presence as beneficial. ``He's opening doors to publishing houses
and institutions where U.S. Hispanic literature has not entered
before,'' said Nicolas Kanellos, the director of Arte Publico Press
in Houston, the largest publisher of Hispanic literature in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Kanellos said Norton never answered his letter in the early
1990s when he approached them about a 10-year project that he is
coordinating with scholars nationwide to recover, index and publish
lost Latino writings in a series of books. (The Norton anthology
will be a single volume of about 2,200 pages.)
</P>
<P>
   Rolando Hinojosa-Smith, a professor of English at the University
of Texas at Austin, insists Stavans deserves the attention that he
is getting.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people complain, then they should sit down and produce,''
said Hinojosa-Smith, who will edit the contemporary
Mexican-American section of the upcoming Norton book.
</P>
<P>
   Still, to some scholars like Ms. Rebolledo, Stavans remains a
bit of a curiosity. ``He doesn't come from within the culture,''
she said. ``He's not Chicano. He's a Mexican. He hasn't been in the
movement ever since it started, so he's a little bit of an
outsider.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't bother Stavans, who considers his status as an
outsider a advantage. Stavans said his own upbringing in a Jewish
ghetto in Mexico gives him a sense of what it is like to feel
marginalized. The theme flows through much of his writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Mexico, I was a Jew. In the U.S., I became a Mexican, but
all these dichotomies helped me to see that you can be an outsider
and an insider simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   ``You become a member of another minority, but not fully. Here
I'm a Mexican in the U.S. I'm a Latino. I'm a Jew. I'm an
American.''
</P>
<P>
   So when Stavans' authority is again questioned, this time in a
review for his skill as editor of ``The Oxford Book of Jewish
Stories,'' he brushes it off. A review in The Times Literary
Supplement in London said, ``Why Oxford University Press, which
used to pride itself on publishing reliable anthologies, should
have sponsored this particular collection, edited by a
nonspecialist, must be left open to question.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you can know enough,'' he said firmly. ``Because you
live in two or three worlds doesn't mean you don't live in any of
them.''

(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 14) 
(af) 
 By MICHELLE LEDER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wall Street is never wrong, according to the common wisdom, just
early in making its investment recommendations. Analysts were
wildly ahead of themselves in 1998, when Congress passed a giant
transportation spending bill; many decided to recommend the shares
of engineering and heavy-construction companies.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with shares down 35 percent, on average, from their 1998
peaks, it may just be time to take the analysts up on their picks.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century,
earmarked $217 billion for federal spending on highways, a 44
percent increase over the bill it replaced. In the first quarter of
1998, the Standard &AMP; Poor's SuperCap Engineering and Construction
Index rose 21 percent, partly in anticipation of the bill's
signing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ran it up because they saw huge amounts of funding,''
said Charles D. Brady, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston,
referring to the construction sector.
</P>
<P>
   But the government's future largess would be overshadowed by
more immediate concerns. Shares of construction and engineering
stocks eased as petrochemical-related projects were canceled
because of declining oil prices. The stocks' retreat became a rout
amid fears of a global recession.
</P>
<P>
   As appropriations failed to materialize, disappointing earnings
reports hurt the industry further. ``Over the past year, just about
every one of these companies has blown up,'' Brady said.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, two construction companies have failed to meet
third-quarter earnings forecasts, leading to selloffs. On Nov. 3,
Granite Construction of Watsonville, Calif., reported profits of 77
cents a share, versus analysts' estimates of 83 cents as reported
by First Call/Thomson Financial. The stock fell 6 percent over two
days, and is now at $20.375.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 27, Stone &AMP; Webster of Boston announced that it was in
violation of its credit agreements and posted a loss of 52 cents a
share instead of the profit of 65 cents a share that analysts had
expected. The stock fell 40 percent in a day; it is now at $15.625.
</P>
<P>
   But 18 months after the transportation legislation was passed,
money is beginning to trickle into the coffers of construction and
engineering concerns. Between $25 billion and $28 billion of
government funds are guaranteed next year, so analysts say the
stocks should begin to recover.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Granite Construction, which despite its
weaker-than-expected quarterly results said it would meet 1999
earnings estimates, analysts' favorites include Jacobs Engineering
Group of Pasadena, Calif.; Morrison Knudsen of Boise, Idaho; and
URS Corp. of San Francisco, an engineering company. All are trading
sharply below their 52-week highs, most near their 52-week lows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first quarter of next year is when you're going to see the
benefit in a major way,'' said David N. Allen, director of research
for the Granite Financial Group, a San Diego brokerage firm not
affiliated with Granite Construction. Allen has buys on Granite,
Morrison Knudsen and URS.
</P>
<P>
   Already, about a quarter of the $2 billion order backlog at URS
is related to the transportation law. URS is now at $21.5625, 27
percent below its 52-week high. Allen, who rates URS a buy, has a
52-week price target of $26. He also has a buy on Granite, with a
target of $25.
</P>
<P>
   The stocks are trading for under 12 times analysts' consensus
estimates for this year's earnings. One of Brady's picks is Jacobs,
now trading at $32.50; his 52-week price target is $45. (Brady also
likes Morrison Knudsen, trading at $8.9375, on which he has a
12-month price target of $14.)
</P>
<P>
   Mark Dyer, an analyst at Strong Capital Management, says the
industry is attractive at current prices. The Strong Common Stock
fund recently increased its position in Jacobs, bringing it up to
1.2 percent of the fund's assets. Separate accounts managed by
Richard T. Weiss, manager of the fund, hold a 1.2 percent stake in
Morrison Knudsen.

AT LEAST 17 KILLED BY QUAKE IN NORTHWESTERN TURKEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ At least 17 people were reported killed
Friday night by an earthquake in northwestern Turkey, and hundreds
more were injured. Many buildings collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are facing a new disaster,'' said President Suleyman
Demirel. ``This is a destructive earthquake. I hope we will not
face a great loss.''
</P>
<P>
   The earthquake struck days before a summit meeting in Istanbul
that President Clinton and the heads of more than 50 other
governments are expected to attend. No serious damage was reported
in Istanbul, but buildings shook and residents of some
neighborhoods fled from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   It was centered near the town of Duzce, in a hilly region
between Istanbul and Ankara.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately we have a heavy toll in Duzce,'' Prime Minister
Bulent Ecevit told reporters. ``The death toll is 17 so far.''
</P>
<P>
   The region around Duzce was hit by a much more severe earthquake
in August that killed more than 17,000 people. Hundreds of
thousands of survivors are still living in tents. The failure of
the government and army to respond quickly to that disaster led to
widespread outrage, and Ecevit moved quickly Friday night to assure
citizens that these failings would not be repeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rescue crews and relief aid have been sent to the region,'' he
said. ``The armed forces sent assistance to the region
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Direct communication with Duzce was cut. News reports said that
the main road leading to the town was impassable and that relief
efforts were curtailed because the local fire station had
collapsed, trapping a number of firefighters. Television footage
showed people there huddling on the street and pouring water on
flames.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is utter helplessness here at the moment,'' reported a
correspondent from one television station. ``Hundreds of buildings
have collapsed, but there is no one who can help.''
</P>
<P>
   The director of an observatory in Istanbul, Ahmet Mete Isikara,
said the quake registered a magnitude of 7.2 on a standard seismic
scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have collapsed buildings,'' the regional governor, Nusret
Miroglu, told one interviewer. ``We need rescue crews and
ambulances.''
</P>
<P>
   The president and Hillary Rodham Clinton are due in Turkey next
week, with their daughter, Chelsea. Clinton is to join other
leaders at a meeting convened by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe.

YEAR 2000 INSURANCE IS HOT, BUT NOT A SIGN OF FEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)

 &HT;

</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Year 2000 insurance has been the hottest-selling item
on Wall Street recently. And its popularity is one reason investors
are less concerned than they were a few months ago about possible
disruptions in business and trading when computers make the
internal change to the new year.
</P>
<P>
   To help ensure that cash will be readily available even if the
changeover disrupts the financial system, the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York has been holding weekly auctions of options that will
guarantee the availability of billions of dollars from Dec. 23 to
Jan 12.
</P>
<P>
   In just four weeks, the Fed has sold $306 billion of the options
and has at least three more auctions planned. The amount paid for
the insurance so far is just $4.9 million, a small price in markets
where trillions are traded.
</P>
<P>
   Other barometers also indicate that institutional and individual
investors have been somewhat reassured leading up to the Century
Date Change _ the Federal Reserve's preferred nomenclature for what
is commonly referred to as the Y2K problem. Because of a design
problem that may render computers unable to recognize ``00'' as
2000 when the new year rolls in, patchwork efforts have been made
across all types of business and government, but the real test will
come Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, many Fed analysts had suggested that central bank
policy-makers would not even consider raising short-term interest
rates in November because higher rates could intensify any problems
at the end of the year. But that view has changed. ``Fears have
subsided,'' said Bruce Steinberg, the chief economist of Merrill
Lynch, who is now expecting a rate increase when the Fed meets
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Though risky securities usually command a higher yield than
Treasury securities, which are backed by the government, the
differences in those yields grew earlier this year. Recently,
however, those spreads have narrowed, indicating that investors are
willing to take on more risk even as the year draws to a close.
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices, meanwhile, have continued to rise. Consumers are
still buying big-ticket items, like automobiles. Mutual fund flows
hint of no significant Year 2000 concern. And the fund company T.
Rowe Price found in a recent survey that only one in 10 of its fund
customers expected to alter investment strategy because of such
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   There was a rush this summer to buy the first six-month Treasury
bills that mature in January 2000, so that proceeds could be
invested after Jan. 1, but no rush this fall when the first
three-month Treasury bills maturing in 2000 became available.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have also taken advantage of opportunities created by
the heightened concern earlier this year. Paul DeRosa, a partner at
Mount Lucas Management, an asset management company in Princeton,
N.J., bought mortgage-backed securities in early August when the
spread between these securities and Treasuries was abnormally wide.
The wide spread reflected, in part, a preference for Treasury
securities, which would be much easier to buy and sell than
mortgage-backed securities in a crisis. The spread has since
narrowed, bringing DeRosa a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Even Edward Yardeni, the chief economist at Deutsche Bank
Securities who has long warned of a Year 2000 recession because of
the date change, is moderating his view.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look as though Y2K will slow down consumer demand
as much as I thought,'' Yardeni said, adding that he would have to
revise upward his fourth-quarter U.S. economic growth forecast,
which has been just 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably will be one of the happiest people on the planet if
nothing happens, since I'm worrying so much about it,'' he said.
Still, he added that he had been ``quite surprised by the
increasing complacency.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said that intense
preparations for the Year 2000 are paying off. ``The good news,''
he said in a speech in October, ``is that evidence is becoming more
persuasive that our electronic infrastructure will be ready for the
Century Date Change. The public's understanding of the degree of
our Y2K readiness also has grown, and fears of widespread
disruptions around the CDC appear to be waning, though we are not
as yet home free.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the additional money is needed or not, the Fed's
insurance program, which was announced in October, is doing at
least part of its job. ``It adds a level of comfort to the
environment,'' said Paul Scheufele, managing director for liability
management at Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance, sold through primary dealers in the Treasury
market, is intended to assure that cash is available to keep
fixed-income markets working smoothly, even in case of computer
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Primary dealers are the center of the repo market, where
securities, like Treasuries, are traded for cash to meet the
short-term needs of Wall Street firms, banks, mutual funds, hedge
funds and corporations. The cash can be borrowed for as short a
period as overnight and is a major means of financing the bets made
in the fixed-income market. If Year 2000 problems send repo
interest rates soaring, this market could dry up, with damaging
ripples through the entire fixed-income market.
</P>
<P>
   Primary dealers say the option insurance costs $15,000 to
$30,000 per billion dollars, depending on the week covered. The
most expensive is for the week beginning Thursday, Dec. 30, which
includes the turn of the year. The options are also available for
the week before and the week after. An option gives the dealer
access to its face value in cash in exchange for securities as
collateral. The interest rate is 1.5 percentage points over
whatever the target rate is then for federal funds, now 5.25
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance would help if mutual funds or corporations
suddenly had trouble borrowing. A mutual fund might need money to
cover withdrawals at the end of the year, while a corporation might
need money to cover a dividend payment.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It insures that if we need cash, we would have the ability to
get it,'' said David Sylvester, who runs the Stagecoach and Norwest
Advantage money market funds for Wells Capital Management, a unit
of Wells Fargo.
</P>
<P>
   If a settlement problem arose in the repo market, making it more
difficult for cash to move through the system, Scheufele said, the
insurance options could be exercised to provide the funds.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of the unknown could also make primary dealers reluctant to
lend at the end of the year. But with this insurance, primary
dealers know their maximum cost of borrowing _ 1.5 percentage
points over the federal funds rate target.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am more comfortable lending out over the year end to my
customers,'' Scheufele said.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, primary dealers, who borrow heavily themselves
to make their bets, will have the cash they need. Without this
source of cash they might be forced to sell holdings, from
Treasuries to mortgage-backed securities, to meet their
obligations. Such dumping could prompt a marketwide selloff, cause
panic among many investors and lead to gridlock in the fixed-income
markets. It happened in 1998 after Russia defaulted on its debt and
a major hedge fund nearly collapsed. The Federal Reserve ultimately
cut its short-term interest rate three-quarters of a percentage
point to ease the strain on the virtually frozen bond market.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of the program, said Joe Blauvelt, the managing
director responsible for the finance desk at J.P. Morgan
Securities, is for the Fed to ``gauge what kind of trading
volatility people expect and then alleviate some of that pressure
by offering more of the insurance options to the dealers.'' This is
why the Fed has expanded the program from five auctions to seven
and why the amount offered has increased with each auction.
</P>
<P>
   But the stampede for the options is not a sign of pervasive
fear, just another relatively inexpensive precaution.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a no-brainer,'' Blauvelt said. ``We are buying
insurance in case the repo market goes away.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also good for job security, added Paul Thomas, head of
government securities sales and trading at Merrill Lynch. ``Knowing
that this insurance was available, an individual cannot afford to
walk into his boss' office at the end of the year and say we can't
get cash,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the signs of continued concern is a buildup in business
inventories. Manufacturing inventories shot up in October,
according to the National Association of Purchasing Management,
indicating that executives are worried about getting deliveries of
products early in the new year. At 51.1, the index reading in
October was the first over 50 since November 1988.
</P>
<P>
   And while some Year 2000 fears from last summer are easing, some
new ones are turning up.
</P>
<P>
   Money market fund managers were worried last summer about having
enough cash to meet withdrawals near the end of the year. Now, they
may have too much cash.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvester, the fund manager, said it was now possible that money
will pour into the bigger funds in December from midsize companies
and local governments with cash on hand.
</P>
<P>
   So he will need places to invest his extra cash. And he has
already made arrangements with primary dealers, who are willing to
do so because they expect the Fed insurance program to help keep
the repo market working smoothly.

THE ENIGMA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, November 14, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH

<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the most curious phenomena on the political landscape is
Steve Forbes' presidential campaign. The New Jersey Republican has
spent $60 to $75 million of his own money in the past four years,
with little to show for it but a 5 percent or so standing in the
polls.
</P>
<P>
   The 52-year-old former publisher may have even relinquished the
control of the family magazine to his brothers and sister, having
sold them portions of his shares in order to raise cash to finance
his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Originally he held 51 percent of the voting stock and 35 percent
of the capital stock, the New York Times reported last month, but
no longer is he the majority shareholder of the intensely private
firm.
</P>
<P>
   He can't simply buy back his shares after the election for fear
of having the earlier ``sale'' ruled an illegal campaign loan, at
least according to experts consulted by the Times.
</P>
<P>
   A pleasant, self-effacing man, Forbes didn't seem, as Tucker
Carlson wrote the other day in the National Standard, ``like the
kind of guy who would blow his family fortune ego-tripping through
a mid-life crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's going on?
</P>
<P>
   One pausible motive might be power. The money he has spent on
negative advertising has given him a fearsome reputation as a kind
of Republican death-star.
</P>
<P>
   The malign effect began in 1992 when Forbes quietly joined
others to forcefully back former New York congressman Jack Kemp's
challenge to incumbent president George Bush. The sniping from the
tax-cut right eventually cost Bush the election.
</P>
<P>
   When Kemp declined to run for the Repiblication nomination in
1996, Forbes jumped into the race himself. The negative
advertisements he unleashed against Bob Dole in the Iowa primary
that year still reverberate on the hustings. Forbes won the
Delaware and Arizona primaries, but found himself without influence
at the Republican convention.
</P>
<P>
   His effectiveness in 1999 seems to have been limited to alarming
George W. Bush into forgoing federal matching funds in order to be
able to match Forbes dollar-for-dollar during the primary season if
Forbes ``goes negative'' again. An advertising blitz is apparently
in the works for New Hampshire and Iowa next week.
</P>
<P>
   (Forbes himself routinely has declined federal matching funds _
which would impose spending ceilings and disclosure requirements _
in order to reserve his option to spend his personal fortune
without limit.)
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with such influence is it persists only as long as
does Forbes' willingness to spend his own money.
</P>
<P>
   What then about the hope of a good appointment if he folds his
hand? Forbes served for a time as chairman of Radio Free Europe
under Ronald Reagan. Perhaps he hopes that George W. Bush will
appoint him Secretary of the Treasury if he joins the team and
helps in the general election?
</P>
<P>
   Not very likely, in the view of most observers of the Bush
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely Forbes is running because he really believes that
his ideas evenually will strike a responsive chord. Though he has
surrounded himself with well-regarded _ and highly paid _
Republican political specialists of all sorts, Forbes still seems
to depend for his ideas mainly on a handful of policy intellectuals
who came to prominence in the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Jude Wanniski and Arthur Laffer apparently are chief among them.
Robert Bartley, editor of the editorial page of the Wall Street
Journal, is a sympathetic fellow traveler. The star of each climbed
highest and shined brightest in the year or two after Ronald Reagan
was elected in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Thus Forbes continually laments their loss of belief and `the
Reagan Revolution.'' Standing next to a piece of the Berlin wall in
front of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum last
week, Forbes solemnly intoned ``Now is the time to tear down this
tax code.'' He pushed school vouchers and medical savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Ronald Reagan's banner of freedom drifting toward the
floor of the political stage, someone had to pick it up and carry
it forward _ and carrying it is what I'm doing in this campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   When Forbes first turned up on the campaign trail in 1995,
Elizabeth Kolbert wrote in a profile in a recent issue of the New
Yorker, ``the press made a sport of trying to describe his
extraordinary inadequency as a canidate.'' Writing in Time, she
noted, Calvin Trillin had compared his appearances to a comedy-club
sketch of a ``dork robot.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has improved his performance on the stump. But reporters
once again have begun competing among themselves to convey their
sense of the hopelessness of Forbes' quest. The first primary is
only a little more than a couple of months away.
</P>
<P>
   But one further possibility is worth keeping in mind. With the
magazine's market value estimated to be around $1 billion, Forbes'
net worth might be as much as $440 million, the Times concluded.
But even if it were substantially less, his claim on the company's
stream of earnings could be considered to be growing at the rate of
_ say _ 10 percent, before taxes, annually, even toward the end of
a long boom.
</P>
<P>
   That apppreciation would be more than enough to cover his
political spending to date without dipping into capital, even
though the magazine temporarily has stopped paying the candidate an
annual salary of some $3 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Might Forbes magazine be planning on some sort of financial
restructuring? Rumors of plans to offer shares in its Internet
site, Forbes.com, have swirled around New York for more than a
year. The magazine has bet heavily on its Internet coverage in the
last few years.
</P>
<P>
   Could the family be planning to tip-toe away from the magazine
altogether? Perhaps. It's an unusual family whose interest survives
intact into the third generations _ especially amid such
spectacular financial success. There are three other brothers who
have taken over day-to-day management of the firm, and many
great-grandchildren of founder B.C. Forbes in the next generation.
There are estate taxes to consider. Just possibly the Forbes story
is mainly a business story after all.

CHECHEN TOWN TYPIFIES RESULTS OF RUSSIAN TACTICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SLEPTSOVSKAYA, Russia _ It was 10 in the morning when the
Russian jets came, as the people of Samashki were climbing out of
their cramped basement shelters after another terror-filled night,
thinking that the bombing had finally stopped. They were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned Chechen families ran for the cover of their houses as
two jets strafed a central road, Cooperative Street, firing
rockets. Two women and three children in the Abdulkadirovs' home
died immediately. An explosion blew off the leg of 12-year-old
Zelimkhan Yakuev as he ran for cover. Dozens more were killed or
wounded as they tried to escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no warning. The Russians told us they were not going
to attack Samashki. They lied,'' said Khava Avturkhanova Thursday
in a hospital in the town of Sleptsovskaya, on the border of
Chechnya 6 miles west of Samashki. She was tending to her daughter,
Madina, 22, one of dozens of people injured in the Oct. 27 attack.
Nearby, a Russian battery fired salvo after salvo in the direction
of Samashki as warplanes dropped bombs in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   Russian leaders claim they are conducting an operation to wipe
out terrorist bases in Chechnya, and bring the separatist Caucasus
region back under Moscow's control. Journalists and other
independent observers are not being allowed into Chechnya to see
for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Samashki, a town of 12,000 about 20 miles west of Chechnya's
capital Grozny, provides an example of what the Russian forces are
doing. In numerous interviews, refugees and wounded who have fled
the town described a systematic bombing and artillery campaign
apparently aimed at killing as many people as possible, no matter
who they are. Some Russian observers agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Present tactics in Chechnya imply war crimes are committed on
a daily bases,'' commented Pavel Felgenhauer, a Russian military
analyst in Moscow. ``The Russian army in Chechnya is rapidly
becoming an army of war criminals _ like the Yugoslav army of
President Slobodan Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   People from Samashki know something about atrocities and brutal
tactics. Nearly 500 people were killed in two attacks by federal
troops during Russia's 1994-1996 war in Chechnya. Nearly every
house was badly damaged or destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   But those interviewed said this time the damage is much worse.
Among the weapons the Russians are using, refugees said, are
``Grad'' and ``Uragan'' antipersonnel rockets, which spread showers
of shrapnel over a wide area, and ground-to-ground tactical
rockets. The way the Chechens see it, this is ethnic cleansing from
the sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the last war was a war against against Chechen fighters,
then this is a war against the whole population,'' said Usam
Baisayev, whose family operated a bathhouse on Cooperative Street,
one of the few buildings still standing from the last war. Now it
is gone, too. Baisayev's uncle, Isa, saw it blow up in a rocket
attack last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Baisiyev family's 30 members are now living on the
generosity of a friend in Ingushetia, crowded into a three-room hut
and subsisting on thin soup and flat bread. They are among the
200,000 people who have fled the violence.
</P>
<P>
   Anxious to avoid the bloody infantry battles that inflicted
heavy losses on their troops during the last war, Russian forces
have employed new tactics this time. They avoid entering Chechen
towns, instead bombarding them with planes, artillery and tactical
rockets.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians may also seek to depopulate towns like Samashki to
deprive Chechen separatist militants of the support the towns
provided in the last war. People from Samashki, though, said they
were determined to stay out of the war this time. After the first
Russian airstrikes in late September, the mayor, Leche Masayev, and
town elders made the decision not to let Chechen fighters into
town.
</P>
<P>
   After that, townspeople said, the Russians said they would not
fire on Samashki. Some who had fled for the neighboring Russian
region of Ingushetia, like Khava and Madina Avturkhanova, came back
in early October. It was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   The bombardment began in earnest on Oct. 22, when Russian troops
sealed the border and a commander, General Alexander Belousov,
announced that there were only ``bandits'' and ``terrorists'' in
Samashki. That night, tank rounds and cloudburst shells landed
first north of the center, then to the south, then on Cooperative
Street. One person was killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians were just taking aim,'' said Usam Baisiyev.
``After the last war, we have all become experts in Russian
military tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   Baisiyev, a former journalist for a Chechen newspaper, was in
Samashki in April 1995 when Russian paramilitary police went on a
rampage, throwing grenades into cellars filled with women and
children and firing flame throwers at civilians in the street. They
said 96 civilians were killed.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1996, 500 civilians were killed during heavy fighting
in the town between federal troops and Chechen separatists. Houses
that had been rebuilt during the lull were destroyed, turning
Samashki into a virtual ghost town.
</P>
<P>
   When Russian troops withdrew in late 1996, people came back and
rebuilt once again. What had once been a relatively prosperous
agricultural town, by rural Russian standards, was now barely
scraping by. People grew their own vegetables and tended cattle and
sheep. The separatist government in Grozny, having won de facto
independence after the Russian pullout, offered only a little help.
For a while there was light and gas.
</P>
<P>
   When the bombing started again this fall, Samashki residents
thought they knew what to expect. But nothing could prepare them
for what happened Oct. 24, when the Russians began bombing in
earnest.
</P>
<P>
   At one moment, the Baisiyevs were sitting in their makeshift
home next to their bathhouse, listening to a Radio Liberty
correspondent report that the Russians had just launched two
tactical rockets towards Chechnya. Two minutes later, the rockets
struck Samashki, followed by a hail of shrapnel from a salvo of
Grad rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Usam's aunt, Lena Baisiyeva, an ethnic Russian, was getting
dressed to prepare for a night in the cold bomb shelter the family
shares with 70 other townspeople.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly, the windows blew out and knocked me back,'' she
said. ``I sensed a burning smell and it was suddenly light on the
street, then it was foggy and you couldn't see anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The two houses next to the Baisiyevs' were destroyed. A girl who
had fled fighting in northern Chechnya was killed. Samashki
residents say the only reason more people were not killed was the
deep ditches many people dug in their gardens, called ``Wolf
Pits,'' something they learned from the last war.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you hide in a cellar, a direct hit on your house can bring
the ruins down on you and trap you there,'' said Alikhadzhi Saitov,
a Samashki refugee living in a chilly tent in the Ingush town of
Karabulak.
</P>
<P>
   But then the Russians changed tactics again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the planes and helicopters fly around in a circle, like
vultures, waiting for anything to move,'' said Isa Baisiyev, Lena's
husband. ``They fire the rockets, and you never hear them coming
until they hit.''
</P>
<P>
   More civilians died each day. Old man Ramzan. Anzar, the goalie
on the local soccer team.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 29, the Russians promised to open the border with
Ingushetia and let civilians flee. Dozens of people from Samashki
joined a convoy of refugees from Grozny and other parts of
Chechnya. But when they reached the border, the Russian troops
turned them back. As the convoy passed Samashki, planes and
helicopters closed in and opened fire, killing at least 25 and
wounding more than 70.
</P>
<P>
   Still trapped in Chechnya, the wounded were forced to go to a
hospital in nearby Urus Martan. But the Russians bombed there, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each time, we had to carry the patients down to the cellar,''
Khava Avturkhanova said. It was only three days later that the
Russians let her take her daughter Madina, who suffered broken arms
and a fractured right leg, to the safer and better-equipped
hospital in Sleptsovskaya.
</P>
<P>
   Madina was also wounded in the last war when a shell fragment
broke her left leg. Khava's brothers and father are still in
Samashki. She has no idea where her husband and two other children
are.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have set up checkpoints on the border where they
inspect all men ages 15 to 50 for signs that they have been
fighting. Some men are led away by the Russians. Ingush police say
they are being taken to a ``filtration camp'' in the main Russian
military base 30 miles north of here.
</P>
<P>
   Lena Baisiyeva went back to Samashki Thursday. Someone has to
tend to the cattle and check on what family belongings are left.
</P>
<P>
   However great the danger, the people of Samashki know that one
day they will have to go back and live there again.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A rising chorus of complaints about fees for using automated
teller machines, particularly those levied on withdrawals from
banks other than the customer's own, have inspired lawmakers to
intervene. At least two states, Connecticut and Iowa, have banned
fees on such ``foreign'' transactions, which can result in two
charges, and several local governments have joined in or are poised
to do so.
</P>
<P>
   But last Thursday, as a ban approved in October by the Santa
Monica City Council in California was about to kick in, Bank of
America and Wells Fargo, which hold more than one-third of the
state's deposits, fought back. They said, in effect, if you won't
let us charge for the service, we won't provide it.
</P>
<P>
   People without accounts could not use 33 ATMs in Santa Monica
and the Bank of America warned it would do the same at 188 more in
San Francisco if a ban took effect there.
</P>
<P>
   Donald G. Ogilvie, executive vice president of the American
Bankers Association, took time last week to discuss this issue,
which pits consumers seeking access to their money against bankers
who say that in a free market, they should be able to impose a
charge for convenience. Here are excerpts from the conversation. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR; Q. How big a surcharge do people without accounts pay to make ATM
withdrawals? &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR; A. I think, on average among banks, it runs in the $1 to $1.50
range; you may be able to find some higher.
</P>
<P>
   But there are a lot of nonbanks that provide these machines _
it's something that almost nobody knows about. The third-largest
provider of ATM machines in the country is EDS, which is not a
bank. They put them all over the country and charge you to use
them. On balance, the bank fees are lower. And pressure on the EDSs
of the world to keep fees reasonable has just gone way down because
the ordinances apply only to depository institutions, meaning banks
can no longer compete with them. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR; Q. A charge of $1.50 is fairly trivial. Why try to collect it when
it makes people so angry? &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR; A. It gets back to the old idea that no business should be
expected to provide free services to noncustomers. It's bizarre to
me that people think banks should do that. It's like saying that a
Burger King patron should be able to get a free Big Mac at
McDonald's or that a company shouldn't be able to charge more for a
Coke from a vending machine than at the supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   The reason we buy Cokes at vending machines is they happen to be
there, cold, when we want them. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR; Q. Do you think consumers are irrational in seeking, after all, to
get their own money back, not buy a product? &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR; A. I think that's a lot of it, but what most people don't
understand is that the money that is theirs is being held and
managed in a bank that they're not a customer of and almost without
exception all their banks provide free service to their own
customers. If you're a customer of Bank of America you can use any
Bank of America ATM anywhere in the world for free, which is quite
extraordinary. When I was growing up the only way to get cash was
to go to your bank during the hours of 9 to 3. Now I can get it in
Paris or New York anytime. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR; Q. Banks seemed to do fine before 1996, when foreign surcharges
were first authorized. Are the costs all that high? &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR; A. Sure. The networks that have been set up since these
convenience fees have been in place have doubled the number of
ATMs. What that says to us is that customers want convenience, and
that they're willing to pay those extra charges that enable banks
to provide machines in places that unless noncustomers could use
them would not justify having a machine.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody makes them use the machine, and it says in clear English
that there is a fee. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is there something you'd like Congress to do, perhaps setting
a reasonable national standard so banks won't have to deal with a
patchwork of law in different jurisdictions? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. No, nothing. There's already legislation that makes these
municipal laws illegal. The comptroller of the currency, which
regulates national banks, has the authority and we believe will
intervene to overturn these ordinances violating the National Bank
Act. Efforts two or three years ago in Congress to bar these fees
did not get any traction.
</P>
<P>
   But if the courts decide to let the bans go ahead and the banks
restrict their ATMs, the consequence, which consumer groups have
not thought through, is that rather than get more convenience, more
choice and lower prices, they'll get less choice and higher prices
because there will be no competition for nonregulated providers.

MITCHELL RECESSES TALKS, HOPING FOR LAST-MINUTE ACCORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST _ With Protestant unionists split over whether to accept
IRA promises to disarm, former US Senator George Mitchell sent both
sides home Friday for the weekend to ``reflect on the magnitude of
the decisions they have to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, who has spent the last two months trying to save the
Good Friday political settlement he brokered in April 1998, had
hoped to wrap up his task Friday. Instead, he will reconvene the
talks on Monday, hoping for a last-minute compromise between
Catholic and Protestant leaders on going ahead with a plan that
would give the IRA's political ally Sinn Fein a share of power in a
new government for Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   While Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble appears willing to
form a power-sharing government in exchange for commitments from
Sinn Fein and the Irish Republican Army that disarmement would
begin quickly, his aides said he has yet to build a consensus in
his party.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble's top deputy, John Taylor, broke ranks Friday, saying he
had voted against accepting assurances from the IRA and Sinn Fein
at a much-disputed meeting of the 27 Ulster Unionists who would
become assembly members if a government is formed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm against the proposals because there's nothing new in
them,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Unionist sources insisted that a majority of the party's
assembly members had not voted against the package of assurances
put forward by the IRA and Sinn Fein, but said Trimble was worried
that he lacked the backing of some key party members, including
Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Kelly, an assembly member for Sinn Fein, said the
unionists had taken only 20 minutes to consider and reject the
written and verbal assurances from the IRA and Sinn Fein that the
process of disarming would begin as soon as the power-sharing
government was formed.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most influential members of Trimble's party are
insisting that the IRA turn in weapons first, or that the IRA make
a formal declaration that the war to force a British withdrawal
from Northern Ireland is over.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble stuck to his refusal to be drawn into what he said were
speculations about the behind-the-scenes negotiations, and some
observers said that the political posturing by some unionists is a
smokescreen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal's been done,'' said Billy Hutchinson, a leader of the
Progressive Unionist Party, the political wing of the Ulster
Volunteer Force, a loyalist paramilitary group.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson said the only remaining question is whether Trimble
can sell the compromise to the Ulster Unionist council, the party's
ruling body. Trimble could put the question to the council on Nov.
20 or Nov. 27, said party chairman Lord Rogan.
</P>
<P>
   But if Trimble is on board, as Hutchinson and other participants
in the talks suggest, it remains unclear whether he can bring his
party with him.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said his 10-week review of the peace process ``has
reached the final and most critical phase.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have asked the parties to pause over the weekend and reflect
on the magnitude of the decisions they have to make,'' Mitchell
said in a statement, sticking to his strategy of low-key diplomacy.
``I recognize that this process has gone on much longer than
originally intended. However, given the gravity of what is at
stake, it is appropriate to take the time necessary to thoroughly
and carefully consider these important matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, could barely contain his
frustration Friday as he left the drab office complex at Castle
Buildings, where Mitchell has been holding court.
</P>
<P>
   ``This review should have been completed by now,'' Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   He said those in the republican movement ``have stretched
ourselves to the limit,'' suggesting that neither Sinn Fein nor the
IRA would make further concessions.
</P>
<P>
   Adams had planned to visit Boston, Philadelphia and New York for
a series of public appearances and fund-raisers next week. He was
forced to cancel those visits last month because Mitchell's review,
initially expected to last a few weeks, has dragged on.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 14)  
 (af)  
 By VERNE G. KOPYTOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The board of Thermo Electron Corp., the scientific, medical and
industrial instrument maker based in Waltham, Mass., did not look
far when it hired a new president and chief executive last spring.
He was one of its own: Richard F. Syron, a Thermo Electron director
since 1997 and the president of the American Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   A company's board might seem a natural pool of talent from which
to draw a leader. After setting aside a couple of seats for
insiders, most companies fill out their boards with experienced
executives from other industries who can offer valuable advice and
look out for the interests of shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   After a few years on the board, good directors become intimately
familiar with the company's affairs and know its strengths,
weaknesses and competitive challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Yet such selections are rare. ``Hiring an executive from the
board is not a practice that is embraced by every company,'' said
Dennis Carey, vice chairman of Spencer Stuart Executive Search
Consultants in Philadelphia, who has studied executive succession
at large companies for a book to be published next year.
</P>
<P>
   While companies often turn to outside directors as useful,
temporary fill-ins, experts say, they are deterred from considering
them to fill top executive posts like chief executive, president or
chief financial officer for the long term. Difficulties like timing
and availability, potential conflicts of interest and corporate
cultures tilt strongly in favor of internal succession or of
searching for someone truly on the outside.
</P>
<P>
   Notable exceptions include Randall L. Tobias, who became chief
executive of Eli Lilly, the pharmaceutical company, in 1993 after
serving as a Lilly director while he was chief executive of the
international division of AT&AMP;T. And in 1987, Alcoa chose one of its
directors, Paul H. O'Neill, who was then the president of
International Paper, as its chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their success, and what Carey described as a generally
favorable track record for other companies who hired from their
boards, few large companies turn to anyone beyond their own
executive ranks, let alone an outside director. Almost 9 out of 10
chief executives of Fortune 100 companies were promoted to the job
from within the company, Carey said.
</P>
<P>
   In most those cases, the successor had been specifically groomed
for the job _ an approach that almost always rules out directors,
to avoid creating an awkward situation for the current chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want a CEO anxious about who on the board wants to
take his job,'' said James Kristie, editor of Directors and Boards,
a quarterly journal that covers corporate boards.
</P>
<P>
   A director designated ahead of time as a future executive is
also put in an awkward position, one that might give shareholders
misgivings: when the interests of management and shareholders
differ, on which side is an outside director who will soon be
inside?
</P>
<P>
   Because of these difficulties, when directors are considered at
all, it is generally when the company has allowed itself to be
taken by surprise and , has no successor who is ready for the job.
Roger Raber, president and chief executive of the National
Association of Corporate Directors, said that in his mind, a
company that hires one of its directors as an executive has
probably planned poorly.
</P>
<P>
   ``When organizations dip into the board, I scratch my head,''
Raber said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a company finds the notion of hiring a director
attractive, its board may not include anyone who would be
available. Outside directors at large companies are typically
people who are well along in their careers, with senior jobs at
other companies, or may be semiretired.
</P>
<P>
   The picture is often different at smaller companies, where the
boardroom-to-executive-suite path is not as rare, corporate
governance experts say. A small company's directors do not
necessarily have senior positions elsewhere, and may be more ready
to make a career change. These companies are also a bit less likely
to have an heir apparent in place, and may not be deep with
management talent.
</P>
<P>
   All of those factors played a role at Camdata, a small computer
software company in Fountain Valley, Calif. David Frosh, a regional
vice president at Automatic Data Processing with previous
experience as a software marketing executive, joined its board in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   When the board discussed problems that Camdata's service
department was having trying to ensure prompt responses to calls
from clients, Frosh volunteered to oversee a reorganization of the
department. The results so pleased his colleagues that the company
chose him as its president in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one inside was ready yet to be president,'' Frosh recalled
in an interview. ``If we had gotten a total outsider, he would not
have been up to speed for maybe a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Camdata was fortunate to have on its board someone like Frosh,
an outsider with direct experience in its industry _ and who is not
retired. Active executives of competing companies are never
considered for board seats, so outside directors generally must
come from outside the industry, not just outside the company.
</P>
<P>
   Roger M. Kenny, managing director of Boardroom Consultants,
based in New York, said that hiring such directors as executives
can mean some compromises. ``You have to ask if their experience is
translatable to your company,'' Kenny said. ``But if you pick your
board right, you have some great athletes who could probably run
most any company.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many uncertainties attend the more common tactic of
hiring outside executives who are not on the company's board.
Newcomers are usually unfamiliar with a company's culture, and it
is difficult to predict how they will get along with the board.
Such risks are sharply reduced when a new executive is chosen from
among the company's directors, corporate governance experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, directors are most likely to be chosen when a company is
in crisis, as when a top executive is dismissed for poor
performance and the board, seeking a change in direction, decides
to pass over a designated successor.
</P>
<P>
   In such a case, looking to the board can be the safer solution,
said Gary Liebl of Los Angeles, a retired technology executive who
over the last 16 years has served on the boards of 25 companies:
``Is it going to be riskier to bring in someone from the outside,
or select a member of the board who knows the lay of the land?''

FILENE'S TO CUT WORK FORCE BY 900 JOBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Filene's Basement Corp. said Friday it plans to shrink
its work force by about 900 more jobs and close an additional 18
stores as the bargain-basement chain seeks to return to the retail
formula that made it famous.
</P>
<P>
   The cutbacks would be on top of a September announcement to
close 17 stores, which could result in as many as 400 lost jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Cash-flow problems forced the Wellesley-based company to file
for bankruptcy protection in August, and US Bankruptcy Court
approval is required for a proposal to convert what had been a
55-store chain with $588.5 million in annual sales into a 22-store
chain with projected annual sales of $350 million.
</P>
<P>
   Three Massachusetts stores, in Burlington, Framingham, and
Worcester, are designated for closing, and plans also call for New
England stores to be closed in Portland, Maine; Manchester and
Nashua, N.H.; and in Warwick, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   If the plan is approved, 14 stores would operate under the
Filene's Basement nameplate, eight of them Massachusetts and the
rest in big urban markets such as Chicago and New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plan will allow us, when we emerge from bankruptcy, to be
a smaller yet stronger operation,'' said Filene's Basement chairman
and chief executive Sam Gerson. ``This is the beginning of our real
strategy'' to return to profitability.
</P>
<P>
   When it entered Chapter 11, the company employed about 4,300
people. The leaner-and-meaner chain now envisioned would employ
about 3,000 workers. Most of the layoffs announced Friday will
occur at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm never happy when we lay people off,'' said Gerson, who
noted that employees who lose their jobs will receive a severance
package based on seniority.
</P>
<P>
   But downsizing is crucial if Filene's Basement is to stay in
business and the remaining 3,000 jobs are to be saved, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company's new strategy was drawn up in consultation with its
creditors and lenders, which makes court approval likely.
</P>
<P>
   Gerson said he could not provide a timetable for when Filene's
Basement might emerge from Chapter 11. And while he expressed the
hope that no more big cuts would be necessary, he said he could not
rule them out.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers typically use the haven of bankruptcy protection to
close unprofitable stores. During its nearly four years in Chapter
11, Bradlees Inc. of Braintree closed about a quarter of its
discount department stores and shed about 6,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But since emerging from Chapter 11 in February, Bradlees has
posted a series of solid monthly sales gains.
</P>
<P>
   Caldor Corp. wasn't so lucky. Unable to reorganize in Chapter
11, it was forced to go out of business earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   By retrenching in Massachusetts and big cities, Filene's
Basement thinks it can avoid Caldor's fate and return to health.
</P>
<P>
   Its remaining stores will not only provide Filene's Basement
with a profitable base but will also allow it to return to the
merchandising approach that made it successful, Gerson said.
</P>
<P>
   The retail formula that made Filene's Basement famous was to buy
last year's designer merchandise from department stores, then sell
those brand names at a big discount.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last decade, many department stores have concluded
that it was more profitable for them to sell last year's goods
through their own newly opened outlet stores rather than to a
regional off-price chain such as Filene's Basement.
</P>
<P>
   That shift in strategy by department stores made it harder for
smaller off-price chains such as Filene's Basement and Loehmann's
Inc., which also recently filed for bankruptcy protection, to find
high quality merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   In simple terms, what seems to have happened to Filene's
Basement was that it couldn't get enough designer merchandise to
stock 55 stores. Instead of famous brand names, disappointed
shoppers were often finding no-name private-label goods.
</P>
<P>
   With a much smaller store base, the Basement hopes it can again
fill its stores with mostly designer brand names.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be buying directly from the best European and American
designers,'' Gerson said. ``The Filene's Basement that customers
know and love is back.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's actions were the company's second big announcement
since filing for Chapter 11.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the company announced plans to close 17
underperforming stores, most of them in suburban locations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to stop the bleeding,'' Gerson said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two weeks, top management and consultants looked
for a plan that would preserve the core of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Stores that were part of Friday's announced round of closings
would be liquidated to provide money for buying more merchandise
for the remaining stores and for paying down debt.
</P>
<P>
   Going forward, plans call for Filene's Basement stores to
specialize in selling designer goods to customers in urban
locations while Aisle 3, the company's new eight-store weekend-only
warehouse chain, targets a suburban customer with more moderately
priced goods.

BUSH PLANS BEEFED-UP TV AD CAMPAIGN IN SOUTHERN N.H. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ One day after a poll showed Texas Governor
George W. Bush in a statistical dead heat with Arizona Senator John
McCain, the Bush campaign has bought Boston television time to
reach southern New Hampshire voters.
</P>
<P>
   The television ads, which are already airing on WMUR-TV in
Manchester, will begin running next week on each of the Boston
stations, including Fox. New Hampshire viewers will see the spots
about three to five times a week, said one Bush official familiar
with the buy.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is following the lead of McCain, who was the first
presidential candidate to place campaign ads on Boston television,
targeting New Hampshire voters. McCain's biographical ad began
airing in Boston at the beginning of this week. Bush also bought
additional television time for a new ad in Iowa and South Carolina
that is not being shown in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Rival campaigns argued Friday that the Texas governor's
prospects in the first-in-the-nation primary state have been
dimming, and the decision to go on television now is an effort to
shore up Bush's support. Voters have complained that Bush has not
spent enough time here, and he has been hammered for missing the
last two forums for GOP candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to turn things around,'' said Paul Young, a
senior adviser to Steve Forbes. ``Clearly, they've changed their
strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Dennehy, McCain's New England director, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we are statistically tied in New Hampshire, we have
seen a dramatic shift beginning in the Bush campaign strategy,''
Dennehy said. ``I think it shows that they underestimated John
McCain and his message of reform and his ability to connect
one-on-one with voters in New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Bush campaign said they had always intended to begin
advertising before Thanksgiving and stay up on the air through the
Feb. 1 primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not yet done anything we didn't plan to do when we
planned to do it,'' said Thomas D. Rath, a Bush adviser in Concord.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Bush, Forbes is also making an addition to his
television buy. Tuesday evening at 7:30, he will hold a 30-minute
question-and-answer session with supporters on WMUR-TV. The
broadcast will be live, and he will take phone calls on the air.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Forbes next week plans to begin a blitz of ads on
national cable outlets, local network affiliates, and radio, Knight
Ridder News Service reported. The first priority, campaign manager
Bill Dal Col said, is to ``put doubts in people's minds about
Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   But Forbes will try to avoid cementing his repuation for running
negative ads, a reputation he gained after his attacks against Bob
Dole and Lamar Alexander in the 1996 campaign. The new ads will
chide Bush for playing it safe and for taking moderate or
ill-defined positions on such issues as Social Security
privatization and school vouchers, Knight Ridder said. Forbes will
narrate the ads himself.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Vice President Al Gore is running ads on
New Hampshire television. Bill Bradley, the former New Jersey
senator, is expected to go on the air before Thanksgiving.

MOST HEREDITARY PEERS MAKE EPOCHAL EXIT FROM HOUSE OF LORDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By SARAH LYALL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LONDON _ For more than a century, reform-minded British
politicians tried to remove the country's hereditary peers from the
House of Lords, an effort so tortuous and ineffectual that, in
1963, Lord Samuel said he felt as if he had spent the previous 50
years watching ``a slow-motion film of a prima ballerina, marked by
an exhibition of almost languid deliberation.''
</P>
<P>
   But Prime Minister Tony Blair is neither languid nor
particularly deliberate, and Thursday he achieved what had long
seemed unachievable: forcing all but 92 of the ``hereditaries,'' as
they are called, to leave the House of Lords for the last time,
never to sit and vote there again.
</P>
<P>
   It was of a piece with Blair's broad program of constitutional
change, a program that has set out to do nothing less than to
reinvent the role of government in British life.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, reform of the House of Lords has been seen as a
left-wing, socialist Labor idea, which generated opposition,'' said
Alan Beattie, a senior lecturer in political science at the London
School of Economics. ``But this change was not represented as
left-wing and socialist, but as modernization, as part of a package
of constitutional reform, and was thus much more difficult to
oppose.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes to the House of Lords ended some 800 years of
Parliamentary history in one fell swoop. But since coming to power
with an overwhelming majority two-and-a-half years ago, Blair's
Labor government has also laid the groundwork for the formation of
new legislative bodies in Scotland and Wales and for a mayor in
London; enacted legislation incorporating the European Convention

first freedom of information law.

<P>
   By removing the hereditary peers _ who inherit their titles and
are, for the most part, descended from the landed aristocracy that
ran England centuries ago _ Blair was dispensing with one of the
most extreme symbols of old-world, class-ridden Britain. Most
Britons felt that having hereditaries in the House of Lords was an
anachronism, if not an embarrassment, said Dr. Rodney Barker, a
constitutional expert at the London School of Economics, but no one
really knew what to do about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody talked about it much or took it very seriously,''
Barker said. ``But once you have a government that is seriously
committed to constitutional reform, once you start looking at the
second chamber and saying, `The majority of these people are here
because of their great-great-great grandfathers, and this is
absurd,' then everyone sees that the emperor has no clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   That has been the view that Baroness Jay of Paddington, leader
of the Lords, has always taken. But last week, Lady Jay _ who is a
life peer, meaning that her title cannot be passed on to the next
generation _ tried to strike a more conciliatory note toward the
666 hereditaries swept into mandatory retirement by the forces of
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this house, hereditary peers have served honorably, and
held the highest office,'' she said. But, she added, ``What may
have been appropriate 800 or even 200 years ago may not be
appropriate now. I do sincerely believe most have the grace and
realism to accept this change is necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For all the swiftness of the change, the removal of the peers
has left Blair with a brand-new problem: what to replace them with.
For now, the House of Lords is to be made up of the 92 hereditary
peers elected to stay on by their colleagues, as well as some 500
life peers appointed over the years by various governments. In
December, a royal commission is to recommend a new configuration
for the Lords, but it is unclear what its proposals will be or how
easy it will be to put them in place.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   This has been difficult for many of the outgoing hereditaries to
take. ``While I have no objection to the government removing the
rights of hereditary peers,'' complained Lord Stanley of Alderley,
in the last remark he would ever make in the chamber, ``they did
not get a mandate to get rid of us without saying very clearly who
is to follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Lord Strathclyde, the Lords' Tory leader, said, `` `Trust
Tony' cannot be made into a constitutional document.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of this century, the House of Lords has held little
real political power, except as a delaying, modifying and tempering
influence on the House of Commons _ a fact that Lord Elton was only
too pleased to point out as the Parliamentary session wound down.
</P>
<P>
   ``This House has historically restrained some of the greater
enthusiasms of prime ministers of many colors, as my noble friend
Baroness Thatcher will confirm,'' he said to former Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher, dressed in funereal black and sitting
stony-faced as the bill to strip the hereditaries of their rights
in the chamber was passed.
</P>
<P>
   The hereditaries did manage to leave with a certain degree of
dignity, cheered by the sometimes stern words of the Lord
Strathclyde. ``This House has inflicted no evil in its history and
much good has been done,'' he said. ``Many people _ the weak, the
unheard, the politically unfashionable _ have come to this place.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Lord Strathclyde delivered a warning of sorts to Blair, saying
that because the hereditary peers who remain were elected to their
seats _ unlike the life peers _ they would probably find a ``new
authority and confidence'' in their role.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the hereditary peers are Conservatives, and removing
them has someone reduced the Conservative majority in the Lords.
But Labor is still in a substantial minority, with only about 180
out of 640 seats, and the Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and
Cross-Benchers, who owe allegiance to no party, are still in a
position to make things awkward for the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are already some very substantive powers in the Lords,''
Lord Strathclyde said. ``I think what the government is going to
discover is that we will be dusting them down, wiping them clean
and starting to use them with a ruthlessness they haven't seen
before.''

   REPUBS-CONGRESS (Washington) _ As this year's congressional

underscores how much they viewed this first session of 106th
Congress as about little more than survival under dire

U.N. AIRPLANE CRASHES IN KOSOVO

   PRISTINA, Kosovo _ A U.N. airplane with 24 people on board
crashed Friday in northern Kosovo during a flight headed here from
Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Wreckage of the plane was found on a steep mountainside about 12
miles northeast of Kosovska Mitrovica, late Friday night, about 12
hours after the plane went missing.
</P>
<P>
   A helicopter pilot who spotted the plane said that its front was
virtually disintegrated and that there were no immediate signs of
survivors, a spokesman for the NATO-led peacekeeping forces told
Agence France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was a daily charter flight by the World Food Program,
a U.N. agency, and normally carries U.N. officials, aid workers and
sometimes journalists from Rome to the newly reopened Slatina
airport here. On Friday, the flight carried 21 passengers and three
crewmembers, but officials would not release the names or
nationalities of the people on board.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said there was no sign that the twin-engine, turbo
propeller aircraft, a French-Italian ATR-42, had been attacked. It
disappeared from radar at about noon near Vucitrn, some 12 miles
northwest of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from the manufacturer said that the plane, 13 years
old, had 25,000 hours of flying time in July, when it was delivered
to an Italian charter company, Si Fly.
</P>
<P>
   The World Food Program currently provides food aid to about
900,000 people a day in Kosovo _ more than half the current
population of the province. During the war in Kosovo from March
through June, some 800,000 ethnic Albanians were driven or fled
from Kosovo, and many of them returned to destroyed houses and
contaminated wells.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands more were forced from their homes inside Kosovo but
never left the province, living as best they could in the
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is feeding about 1.5 million people throughout the
Balkans, as well as some 500,000 people in Yugoslavia who were
affected by the war.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the agency fed some 75 million people, including most
of the world's refugees, and operated in 80 countries. According to
the agency, it has lost more employees than any other U.N. agency _
51 since 1988 _ in work-related accidents, illnesses or attacks.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russian officials said Friday that they had largely
driven Islamic rebels from Gudermes, the second-largest city in
Chechnya, and in an unmistakable sign of their intention to retake
complete control of the separatist republic, proposed to move the
capital there from Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   The International Committee of the Red Cross underscored the
deteriorating military situation by announcing that it is pulling
its workers out of Chechnya to focus on helping refugees in
Ingushetia, the republic to the west.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Prime Minister Nikolai Koshman, Russia's official
representative on Chechen issues, said those residents who had not
already fled the almost constant Russian bombardment of Grozny
should get out. Any part of the city that was rebuilt after the
last devastating war there, in 1996, ``has recently been destroyed
and blown up,'' Koshman said. ``The city cannot be restored.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian press services reported Friday that oil refineries and
other strategic sites on Grozny's outskirts were under the heaviest
aerial attack of the war.
</P>
<P>
   The occupation of Gudermes, on Chechnya's eastern border,
further tightened the ring of troops and armor that Russia has been
deploying around Grozny since a counterattack against the rebels
began in earnest two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Russian spokesmen at a temporary news center in Dagestan, the
republic to the east of Chechnya, said troops had discovered a
high-explosive bomb and the bodies of 57 rebels during an intensive
sweep through Gudermes. Some rebels were reportedly hiding out in
the city, but Russian military officials expressed confidence that
the town would come completely under their control by next week.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military already controls hilltops north of the
capital and is attacking west of Grozny through Barmut. Chechen
military officials have long promised a counterattack, but it has
failed so far to materialize.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo said Friday that
seizing Grozny was not on the agenda of the Russian military for
now, although there are plans to take a number of other villages in
the region.
</P>
<P>
   The Interfax news service quoted Valery Manilov, deputy chief of
the general staff, as saying the war could be all but wrapped up by
the end of the year _ an optimistic statement by Russian standards,
and one that would have been unthinkable even a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   With President Boris Yeltsin due in Istanbul next week for a
crucial meeting on European security, the Kremlin seemed to be
working overtime to depict its much-criticized operations in
Chechnya as a military fait accompli.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, of the leaders of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, is expected to highlight Western concerns
about potential human-rights violations in Russia's prosecution of
the war.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow has come under increasing criticism since Russian rockets
slammed into a Grozny open-air market nearly three weeks ago,
killing almost 150 Chechens and stampeding senior Russian officials
into a series of conflicting explanations of their actions.
</P>
<P>
   The Istanbul meeting is notable in part because Russia's
deployment of tens of thousands of troops in Chechnya is a
technical violation of one of the underpinnings of a post-Cold War
security accord, the treaty on conventional forces in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin has asked European leaders to overlook the violation as
a temporary and necessary response to an internal uprising.
</P>
<P>
   He also is expected to press for agreements that members of the
security organization not intervene in national conflicts unless
asked to do so by those fighting, and that national sovereignty be
deemed a guiding principle in enforcing human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Assenting to either proposal would bolster Russia's defenses
against international criticism of its handling of the Chechnya
conflict. But while officials are clearly nettled by Western
criticism, there is little indication that it is hindering their
conduct of the war.
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary, the hard-line approach to the Chechen conflict
continues to draw almost unanimous support in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church, Aleksy II, issued
a remarkable statement Friday endorsing Russian attacks in
Chechnya, saying the government cannot tolerate sin and lawlessness
and is obliged to deal with the bombings, kidnappings and killings
that have flourished in Chechnya's anarchy. But the patriarch also
urged the government to pay special heed to civilians and refugees.
</P>
<P>
   While the Yeltsin administration has responded to Western
objections by suggesting that a political solution to the war is a
priority, there is scant indication that any such search is under
way.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Rushailo ruled out talks with the only political
authority in Chechnya, its president, Aslan Maskhadov, saying he is
too closely allied to the Islamic military leaders who control much
of the countryside and whom the Russians have branded terrorists.

EUROPEAN TENSIONS, POST-COLD WAR ASSESSMENT FOCUS OF CLINTON TRIP 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton launches a 10-day trip to Europe
on Sunday that will take him to Turkey where earthquakes still
shatter nerves, to Greece where threats prompted changes in his
schedule and to Kosovo where violence still impedes peace.
</P>
<P>
   The president at midweek will join other Western leaders in
Istanbul at a meeting of the 54-member Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe to reassess the organization's mission a
decade after the end of the Cold War. On tap: Russia's bombing of
Chechnya and aid to the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger, the national security adviser, said the
president's itinerary and the OSCE agenda intend to highlight those
difficult issues and regions still troubling Europe as a new
century approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can eliminate that zone of instability if we meet the
remaining challenges: By promoting stability in the Balkans,
democracy in Serbia, reconciliation in the Aegean, a settlement on
Cyprus, peace in the Caucasus and integration of Russia into the
global community,'' Berger told reporters Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dealing with this unfinished business and strengthening our
ties with key allies will be the president's top priorities next
week and as a large part of America's agenda in the coming year,''
he said. But outside developments also have raised concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Another large earthquake, measured at 7.2 magnitude, struck the
town of Duzce on Friday, shaking buildings more than 160 miles away
in Ankara and Istanbul ``as though they were made of rubber,''
according to The Associated Press. Clinton plans to stay in both
cities as well as visit Izmit, where a 7.4 quake killed 17,000
people in August.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said the tremor was unlikely to affect the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton begins his official visit Monday in Ankara at sessions
with President Suleyman Demirel and Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit.
He also will address the Turkish National Assembly and encourage
the Islamic nation to maintain its secular course and to reduce its
tensions with its historic rival, Greece.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the president will meet with earthquake survivors in
Izmit and tour the damaged region. On Wednesday, he flies to
Istanbul for a separate session with Greek Orthodox, Jewish and
Armenian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The two-day OSCE summit begins Thursday where Clinton and other
world leaders will sign a statement of principles on human rights,
democracy and security to reflect the new alignments from the
demise of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   ``This document recognizes the threats to our security are as
likely to come from conflicts within states as between them, and it
will (give) new tools and a new mandate to prevent and manage
internal conflict, a role it's begun to play from the Balkans to
the Caucasus,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   At issue also will be Russia's military bombardment of one of
its own provinces, Chechnya. The OSCE session will allow Clinton
and Russia President Boris Yeltsin to meet face-to-face where the
president again will urge a negotiated settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said the United States also will use the OSCE session to
push for an oil pipeline to transport Caspian Sea crude from
Azerbaijan to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will diversify the international community's sources of
energy, help the newly independent states of the region stand on
their own feet, power Turkey's growth and provide a profoundly
important corridor that is not only of economic importance but of
strategic importance for these countries to the West,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The president will spend Nov. 20 in Greece, which initially was
to be the first stop on his tour. However, there have been mass
anti-U.S. protests in Greece leading up to the traditional Nov. 17
date when the 1973 Junta put down protests by students. A terrorist
group that also goes by the name of November 17 remains at large. A
series of explosions has rocked Athens for days.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit to Athens was delayed and shortened at the
recommendation of the Greek government. Greece opposed the U.S.-led
NATO bombing campaign against the Serbs, who are Orthodox
Christians like the Greeks. Greeks also blame the United States for
Turkey's invasion of Cyprus. Large demonstrations are expected
during Clinton's visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If any country is a model for young democracies in the Balkans
and expression of dissent, it is the birthplace of democracy in
Greece, and I suspect we will see some of that while we're there,''
Berger said, downplaying any security concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The president will spend next weekend in Florence, Italy, for a
conference on governing in the 21st century. He begins his second
week in Bulgaria, once a Communist stronghold and now an emerging
model for democracy and open markets.
</P>
<P>
   The president will end his trip with a stop in Macedonia and
Kosovo. The president intends to have a pre-Thanksgiving meal with
U.S. troops stationed in Kosovo. He also hopes to quell the revenge
killings by Kosovars against their Serb neighbors and to renew his
message for Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic to step aside.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton on Friday signed a directive denying visa entry into the
United States by Milosevic's supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president will reaffirm our determination to finish that

IN N.H. PRIMARY, THE INDEPENDENTS   RULE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ They are the great unknown of the New
Hampshire presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicious of organized political parties, wary of establishment
candidates, and not easily corralled, independent voters in New
Hampshire usually don't make up their minds until the very last
minute. To make things more complicated for campaign strategists,
independents can cast a ballot in either the Democratic or
Republican primary come Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   This x-factor in the race for president looms all the larger for
the two Democrats and six Republicans because the ranks of
``undeclared'' voters have recently grown so rapidly that they are
expected to outnumber registered Democrats and registered
Republicans for the primary, according to the New Hampshire
Secretary of State's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every campaign is going to have to reach those people,'' said
Patrick W. Griffin, a Republican media strategist here who is
helping Texas Governor George W. Bush. ``Independents are going to
be extraordinarily important.''
</P>
<P>
   As of November 1998, there were 272,134 undeclared voters in the
state, compared to 272,217 registered Republicans and 203,257
registered Democrats. William Gardner, the Secretary of State, has
been polling local election officials and believes that independent
registrants are now the largest voting bloc in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of many independent voters here is Anna Armstrong, a
retired school teacher from Manchester, who prefers to consider the
person, not the party, when making up her mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we should listen to all sides and listen to what they
have to say,'' said Armstrong, after spending an afternoon hearing
out Vice President Al Gore at a question-and-answer session
recently. ``I know people who are one thing because their parents
were -- they don't listen to anything, the party makes all the
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, who was a registered Democrat before New Hampshire
allowed people to register without a party affiliation, is
intrigued by the three candidates with national experience: Gore,
former Democratic Senator Bill Bradley and Republican Senator John
McCain. In the 1996 primary, she voted for President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Watts, a salesman for Wonderbread in Manchester, is also an
independent and shares many of Armstrong's feelings about political
parties. ``I don't feel that any party has all the answers,'' said
Watts, who voted the libertarian ticket in 1996. This time around,
he's interested in Gore, McCain and Texas Governor George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But while Armstrong, Watts and other independents reject the
Democratic or Republican party labels, they rarely vote en masse,
tipping the balance of an election one way or another. Many
analysts suspect -- though there is no solid research to back it up
-- that the number of independents has grown due to an influx of
new residents, many of them Massachusetts emigres. They also
believe that independents -- once thought to tend to vote
Republican -- are now more willing to vote in the Democratic
primary.
</P>
<P>
   Still, independents are far less likely to vote than people who
consider themselves Democrats or Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime somebody is listed as independent or nonpartisan, it's
usually a reflection of a lower interest in politics,'' said Andy
Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and other pollsters have found that independents do seem
to be drawn this year to a few particular candidates. McCain, the
Arizona senator, is popular among independents who lean Republican.
And Bradley, who used to represent New Jersey in the Senate, draws
well among independents who lean toward the Democratic side of the
spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   In recent polls, independents have given Bradley the edge over
Gore. Gore, for example, was favored among registered Democrats by
50 to 39 percent in Smith's last sample. Bradley, however, edged
Gore by 44 to 42 percent among independents.
</P>
<P>
   For Bradley to win the primary, Smith said, he will have to
continue to enjoy strong support among independents, and the
independents will have to turn out and vote. But Smith said Bradley
has demographics on his side. His supporters tend to be older, with
more education and a higher income than Gore's backers, who tend to
be younger, blue-collar people who may or may not have completed
high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley's got the people who actually show up and vote,''
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent Franklin Pierce College/WNDS-TV poll, McCain
outclassed Bush among independents, 33 to 25 percent. Bush,
however, still drew better among Republicans, giving him an
eight-point lead against McCain, 38 to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This year, there is no single issue that is galvanizing
independent voters. In fact, they are much like other voters in
their interests: education, health care, Social Security and
Medicare, crime and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just seem to be motivated a little less by any issue than
Republicans or Democrats and there doesn't seem to be any issue
that's pushing their buttons,'' said Smith.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Patrick J. Buchanan managed to push their buttons with
his protectionist trade policy and fiscal conservatism. By
snatching the independent vote late in the game, Buchanan edged out
Bob Dole and Lamar Alexander to win the primary in the final days.
Independents also gravitated toward Buchanan in 1992, hurting
former President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things independents hate is a politician,'' said
Griffin, alluding to Bush's difficulties in 1992 and Gore's
problems this season. ``Albert Gore is the antithesis of an
independent's candidate -- he's big, he's party, he's the
endorsement machine.''
</P>
<P>
   In their own way, each of the campaigns are making appeals to
the independent voters. George W. Bush, the Texas Governor, is
trying to broaden his support outside mainstream Republicans by
taking issue with votes by the GOP Congress. Gore is picking up on
some of Bradley's rhetoric, talking about running ``a different
kind of campaign,'' and challenging Bradley to debates, as if
Bradley were the front-running, establishment candidate. And
McCain, Gore and Bradley, especially, are striving for as many
individual conversations with voters as they can squeeze in.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's great about the New Hampshire primary is the state is
two congressional districts -- we can talk to everybody, so you get
to make an appeal to everybody,'' said Mark Longabaugh, Bradley's
New Hampshire director.
</P>
<P>
   There is always the danger, however, of annoying these voters
who profess so little patience for conventional political appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Independents are going to become weary of everyone trying to
pander to them,'' said Griffin. ``Independents are independent
because they're independent. They wait late and break late.''

 &HT;    Many churches continue to grapple with homosexuality
 &HT;    By Stephanie Allmon
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ When the Rev. Jerry Falwell met with gay activist
minister Mel White at an antiviolence summit earlier this month,
they didn't hesitate to pick up the stones they normally cast at
each other.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of taking aim and counting casualties, the seemingly
natural-born enemies put down their weapons and agreed to look for
common ground as a way to stop violence, particularly against gay
people.
</P>
<P>
   The same proverbial stones these two groups have thrown over the
years have also shattered denominational and, in some cases,
congregational unity, wounding people on every side.
</P>
<P>
   Christians have faced many moral and cultural issues in recent
memory, from racism, divorce, to women's roles in the church, yet
homosexuality seems to top a hierarchy of moral dilemmas. Why?
</P>
<P>
   To find the answer, some clergy and theologians say, one must
evaluate today's culture along with the culture in which the Bible
was written.
</P>
<P>
   The critical question for Christians is whether homosexuality is
a sin.
</P>
<P>
   Christians who look to the Bible for guidance on the issue may
find surprisingly little said about homosexuality. Biblical
scholars and clergy members recognize six scripture passages that
they say are at the heart of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Disagreement about how to interpret those passages stems from
differences in opinion about how authoritative the Bible is and how
relevant it is in today's culture, said Victor Paul Furnish,
university distinguished professor of New Testament at Southern
Methodist University's Perkins School of Theology.
</P>
<P>
   At one end of the spectrum are fundamentalists who understand
the Bible to be the inerrant word of God and who take its teachings
literally. At the other extreme are those who regard the Bible as
``more or less a curious artifact of history,'' Furnish said. But
the vast majority of churchgoers are in the middle, he said.
</P>
<P>
   To further complicate the issue, the word ``homosexual'' is not
found in original texts of the Bible, said Michael L. White,
professor of classics and Christian origins and director of the
religious studies program at the University of Texas at Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The term 'homosexual' does not exist in the Bible,'' he said.
``You can't find it. It's just not there.''
</P>
<P>
   Over time, he said, certain words have been translated to equate
homosexual behavior with immorality.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most controversial Biblical reference, Romans
1:26-27, says, ``Because of this, God gave them over to shameful
lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural
ones. In the same way, the men also abandoned natural relations
with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men
committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves
the due penalty for their perversion.'' (NIV)
</P>
<P>
   Furnish said those who interpret these passages as literal
expressions of God's will, without regard to cultural changes,
would say that same-sex relations violate a natural order of
creation in which heterosexuality is the norm.
</P>
<P>
   But Christians who take the Bible as an expression of human
opinion, to be understood in the context in the day which it's
written, may say that Paul, the author of Romans, personally
believes that same-sex relations are sinful and uses the example to
illustrate what goes wrong with the world if people don't worship
God, Furnish said.
</P>
<P>
   Same-sex relations were not necessarily considered sinful in
biblical times, White said. In fact, in ancient Greek culture,
homosexuality was viewed as a higher plane of spiritual
relationships, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But A.J. Conyers, professor of theology at Baylor University's
George W. Truett Seminary, said the Bible illustrates that
homosexuality is a social disorder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting the way in which (homosexuality) is brought
up,'' he said. ``It's always illustrative of the outer edge of
cultural disintegration. The intention of the Bible is not to say
this is the worst sin in the world, but to say here very clearly
how sin turns the human being against nature.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bible more clearly spells out other types of sexual sins,
such as premarital sex, adultery and even lust, but scholars offer
different reasons as to why homosexuality is such a hot-button
issue within Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   White said the belief that homosexuality is a sin is one of the
last vestiges of an older version of Christian morality that has
undergone many changes. That morality once included positions on
other social issues, such as racism, that have changed as people's
world views have changed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many people believe homosexuality is a sin because it violates
an assumed, ordained social order that includes marriage and
heterosexual sex, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Conyers said homosexuality has become a public issue for
Christians in recent years as gay rights advocates have grown more
vocal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not such a big issue 20 years ago because no one was
trying to make the case that homosexuality was a normal way of
life,'' he said. ``The reason the Christian community gets involved
is since that time, there's been an aggressive case made by
militant homosexuals to the effect that they should be given
privileges equivalent to other minorities.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dean Riley, deacon of Central Texas Metropolitan Community
Church from the Heart, suggests that some clergy have used the
issue of homosexuality to rally troops for their own causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very easy to draw a congregation together if you have a
common rallying point,'' he said. ``Homosexuality, being so
personal and intimate, makes a great rallying cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two decades, nearly every Christian denomination,
and many individual churches, have been forced to evaluate such
issues as the ordination and marriage of gays.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most recent public denominational struggles has been
within the United Methodist Church after several pastors performed
same-sex marriages and were subsequently suspended from the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Sharon Robertson of Waco's First United Methodist
Church said that although homosexuality is incompatible and
inconsistent with the teachings of the United Methodist Church,
``the church says that ... homosexuals are no less people of worth
than heterosexuals, and all people need the ministry and guidance
of the church.''
</P>
<P>
   While many churches take a similar ``love the sinner, hate the
sin'' position, others actively seek to ``reform'' homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   In a September Waco Tribune-Herald religion page column that
received a barrage of responses, the Rev. Larry Courtney, pastor of
St. Mary's Missionary Baptist Church in Waco, stated that a rise in
homosexuality is a sign of society's decay. He called on Christians
to ``preach, teach, and pray to stamp out Satan in his lustful
attempt to deceive and consume our brothers and sisters,'' even if
it means being called hypocrites, gay bashers or homophobic bigots.
</P>
<P>
   But some churches are realizing the need to transform attitudes
to stop any hatred or harassment coming from within the
congregation.
</P>
<P>
   The Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod's ``Plan for Ministry to
Homosexuals and their Families'' offers responses to friends and
family members who struggle with a loved one's homosexuality and
ways to assure homosexuals the church won't reject them.
</P>
<P>
   Rejection often causes Christian homosexuals to leave the
church, Riley said. The MCC denomination was established as a
refuge for people seeking a congregation that welcomed gay and
lesbian Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many cases, (MCC church members) are people who have been
wounded by their faith traditions,'' Riley said. ``Perhaps they
have been in a church setting where they have been told
homosexuality is an abomination and they won't be welcomed into
heaven. If you are a spiritual person, that hurts. That hurts very
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Waco resident Randy Culp left his Southern Baptist faith behind
at age 30 when he revealed to his wife, his children and his father
_ a Southern Baptist pastor _ that he was gay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to leave that tradition from which I grew up and go
elsewhere for my connection to God or a higher order of the
universe,'' he said. ``Then, as a direct result of my church now
(Unitarian Universalist), I came full circle and re-embraced
Christianity with a broader world view and greater options for
appreciating the value of Christianity.''
</P>
<P>
   FACING THE ISSUE
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said pastors are not shying away from facing
homosexual issues within their churches. She said she regularly
ministers to homosexuals, and she welcomes the opportunity to guide
their spiritual lives without trying to ``fix'' their sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thankfully, it's not left up to me to say who goes to heaven
and who doesn't,'' she said. ``My ministry is to help lead people
to their own understanding of who God is in their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley said instead of trying to figure out whether homosexuality
is a sin, Christians should concentrate on the commands God gave to
love him and to love others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a very personal issue that's between the
individual and God; however, as a church community, we are called
to encourage people to enter into a right relationship with God,''
he said. ``God has given us a commandment to love, and if that
means that we have to acknowledge that we have been created
homosexuals, that's OK, because God loves us and created us this
way, so we have a duty to thank God for that.''
</P>
<P>
   But is all the internal arguing over homosexual issues hurting
evangelism efforts by the church at large?
</P>
<P>
   Conyers said he doesn't think so. In fact, he said, if a church
takes a strong position against homosexuality, an unwillingness to
waiver actually strengthens its integrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that the church doesn't compromise on basic
convictions about moral life, they have a stronger witness; people
take them more seriously,'' he said. ``When they compromise and
relativize, the church becomes unreliable.''
</P>
<P>
   But Conyers acknowledged that many churches and congregations
will continue to grapple with the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may well be something that will test the church,'' he said.
``And I think it is right now.''
</P>
<P>
   In his booklet ``Homosexuality and The Christian Faith:
Questions of Conscious for the Churches,'' Walter Wink, a theology
lecturer who leads nonviolence seminars around the world, suggests
Christians may have to agree to disagree about homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We in the church need to get our priorities straight,'' he
said. ``We have not reached a consensus about who is right on the
issue of homosexuality. But what is clear _ utterly clear _ is that
we are commanded to love one another. We don't have to tear whole
denominations to shreds in order to air our differences on this
point.''
</P>
<P>
   With more public discussions like Falwell and White's, bridges
can be built across gaps that have been carved out between
churches, denominations and communities, Furnish said, suggesting
that Christians work together to solve more pressing social and
environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hope, my reasonable expectation, is that through the
process of charitable dialogue, persons who differ on this
particular issue will come finally to see that there are more
important things that bind them together as believers than one
particular point that separates them,'' he said. ``In addition,
there are far weightier moral issues that need to be addressed and
can be addressed by Christians.''

 &HT;    Interpreting the verses
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ These six Bible passages are at the heart of the
debate over whether homosexuality is a sin. Some theologians argue
that readers must consider today's culture along with the culture
in which the Bible was written to interpret these verses.
</P>
<P>
   1. ``Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of
the city of Sodom _ both young and old _ surrounded the house. They
called to Lot, `Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring
them out to us so that we can have sex with them.' Lot went outside
to meet them and shut the door behind him and said, 'No, my
friends. Don't do this wicked thing. Look, I have two daughters who
have never slept with a man.''' _ Genesis 19:5-8 (NIV)
</P>
<P>
   2. ``Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is
detestable.'' _ Leviticus 18:22 (NIV)
</P>
<P>
   3. ``If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of
them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their
blood will be on their own heads.'' _ Leviticus 20:13 (NIV)
</P>
<P>
   4. ``Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even
their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the
same way, the men also abandoned natural relations with women and
were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent
acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for
their perversion.'' _ Romans 1:26-27 (NIV)
</P>
<P>
   5. ``Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the
kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral
nor idolators nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual
offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers
nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.'' _ I Corinthians
6:9-10 (NIV)
</P>
<P>
   6. ``We also know that law is made not for good men but for
lawbreakers and rebels, the ungodly and sinful, the unholy and
irreligious, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for
murderers, for adulterers and perverts, for slave traders and liars
and perjurers _ and for whatever else is contrary to the sound
doctrine that conforms to the glorious gospel of the blessed God,
which he entrusted to me.'' _ I Timothy 1:9-11

ART PROBERS HEARTENED BY RETURN OF SAN FRANCISCO WORKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDITH GAINES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The mysterious reappearance this month of three
masterworks stolen from the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco in
1978 improves prospects that art treasures taken from Boston's
Isabella Stewart Gardner museum may be returned, art experts and
investigators said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This occurrence should hearten those who want to see the art
works returned, all the officials at the Gardner and others who
have worked so hard on this case all these years,'' said Brien
O'Connor, a former assistant US Attorney who handled the
investigation into the Gardner heist from 1992 until May 1999.
</P>
<P>
   On St. Patrick's Day, 1990, at 1:24 am., two men talked their
way into the Gardner Museum, telling guards they were policemen
investigating a disturbance. They bound and gagged the guards and
left them in the basement while they stole 11 paintings, a bronze
Chinese beaker and a finial from a Napoleonic flag, valued at a
total of $200 million-$300 million.
</P>
<P>
   The stolen paintings included Vermeer's 17th Century
masterpiece, ``The Concert;'' Rembrandt's priceless ``Storm on the
Sea of Galilee,'' his only known seascape; a Rembrandt
self-portrait; and ``Chez Tortoni,'' a painting by Eduard Manet.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said agents investigating the Gardner case have
received thousands of tips and tracked down leads that pointed to
the Irish Republican Army, a Japanese collector, a rock musician,
antiques dealers and more _ but they have yet to make an arrest in
what is considered the world's costliest art heist.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor and others said the return of the San Francisco
paintings, valued at $75,000, provides one answer to the question
asked about the Gardner theft: Why were they stolen?
</P>
<P>
   ``Artworks are often stolen by thieves who think they'll have a
much easier time making money, or trading them for value, than they
do,'' O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Benefield, asst. director of the Harvard University Art
Museums, said ``It makes it pretty clear, if after 21 years the
thieves couldn't find a home for those paintings, how difficult it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   A package containing ``Portrait of a Rabbi,'' an oil painting
attributed to Rembrandt, and two other European paintings were left
at the William Doyle Galleries on Nov. 2, with an anonymous note
saying they had been stolen from the San Francisco museum,
officials from the Doyle revealed this week.
</P>
<P>
   Art authorities were quick to note investigations into the San
Francisco and Boston heists are still under &UR;  &LR; way, and many
possibilities are being considered about who might have taken the
paintings, and why.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, the fact that (the San Francisco paintings) were
returned may be a reflection on the difficulty of selling stolen
art,'' said David Shillingford, marketing director for the Art Loss
Register, in New York. ``There's no question that it's increasingly
difficult to market this sort of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Publicity concerning art appropriated as loot during World War
II and other military campaigns has also raised public
consciousness about the difficulties of selling art with fraudulent
or unclear ownership titles, Shillingford said.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that the $1 million reward offered for the return of
the items stolen from the Gardner museum ``makes it unlikely that
somebody would just leave the goods on someone's doorstep,'' as
they did in New York.
</P>
<P>
   They might be more likely to accept a reward, however, than risk
fencing the stolen merchandise, Shillingford said.
</P>
<P>
   The return of the San Francisco museum's paintings ``says to me
that the art taken from the Gardner will not be destroyed. We will
see those artworks again,'' O'Connor said. ``The only question is:
when?''

PREDICTING SUNNY DAYS FOR LATIN STOCKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (dw) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those analysts who last year consigned Latin America to a long
convalescence after the economic crises in Asia and Russia and the
near collapse of Long Term Capital Management might want to think
again.
</P>
<P>
   Summer is about to start south of the Equator, and the Latin
economies, which were not hurt as badly as many feared a year ago,
are looking much livelier.
</P>
<P>
   The stock markets are doing well, too. From the start of the
year through Thursday, the 58 Latin American equity funds tracked
by Lipper Inc. have posted an average total return of 30.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are excited about the potential for further gains:
Based on price-to-earnings ratios, Latin stocks are very
inexpensive compared with those of other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Asili, Latin American equity strategist for J.P. Morgan,
took some time last week to discuss how the coming year is shaping
up for Latin stocks. Following are excerpts from the conversation:
</P>
<P>
   Q. Latin stocks have been very strong for the last couple of
weeks. Why is that?
</P>
<P>
   A. When the European and American bond markets began their
strong rally, that was a big positive for Latin equity markets.
Also, during the period this summer when the American stock market
was correcting, there were net inflows into international equity
funds. Some of that money went into Latin funds. Finally, there is
a sense that the Latin economies have bottomed out and are in a
recovery phase.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you agree that the worst is over for these economies?
</P>
<P>
   A. Our economists have forecast that growth will show a steady
acceleration in Latin America through the end of next year, to an
annualized year-over-year rate of 4.4 percent by the fourth quarter
of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The drivers will be Chile and Mexico. Brazil will be a little
weaker than those countries, with growth of about 2.5 percent in
the first half of the year, accelerating to 3.5 percent in the
second half. And Argentina should see its economy accelerate in the
second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Latin stocks and economies are hostage to what happens in
American and European bond markets. Do you fear a rise in interest
rates in the developed world?
</P>
<P>
   A. It is very likely we will see bond yields back up some, but
we will not return to the levels we hit three weeks or a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   And while fixed-income spreads between emerging-market bonds and
Treasuries have narrowed, we think they could narrow further.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the crisis last year, rates on emerging-market
bonds were as high as 17 percent above U.S. Treasuries, according
to the J.P. Morgan emerging-markets bond index. Now, that spread is
around 9.8 percent. Conservatively, we could get a further
2.50-percentage-point improvement in those bond spreads.
</P>
<P>
   It depends on the country, but in Latin America a
1.5-percentage-point compression in those spreads could lead to an
expansion in price-to-earnings ratios on stocks of 20 percent to 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Political instability is often another source of potential
concern in emerging markets. Do you see potential problems in any
of the major Latin countries?
</P>
<P>
   A. No one can say that nothing bad will happen, but at this
point the outlook looks positive.
</P>
<P>
   I feel comfortable about political stability in Argentina, Chile
and Mexico, which will hold presidential elections next summer.
There is a lot of confidence in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four major investible countries, Brazil is the country
where there is some risk. That is not because of impending
elections, but because of the future of economic reform and
liberalization.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How do you see the rally continuing? And do you have a list
of stocks that are trading as American Depository Receipts in this
country that you like?
</P>
<P>
   A. Recently, the stocks that have outperformed have been the
telecommunications companies, which are by far the most liquid.
Telmex, Telebras and Televisa have all moved up significantly. As
the rally matures, we expect it to broaden out.
</P>
<P>
   There are at least 10 stocks that are liquid, trade ADR's and
have very good bottom-up fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, Coca-Cola Femsa, which has risen around 5 percent
this week, still offers good value. Two conglomerates we like are
Grupo Alfa and Carso. Cifra, a retailer, is another.
</P>
<P>
   In Brazil, we like some of the retailing stocks. We just
upgraded Pao de Azucar. We like Tele Norte Leste, a
telecommunications company. And we like Brazilian steel stocks CST
and CSN, which are selling at valuations that are among the most
compelling in the world.
</P>
<P>
   And in Chile, we like Endesa, an electricity company.

CAR BOMB BRINGS CALL FOR MORE US AID TO COLOMBIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the threat of renewed narco-terrorism in
Colombia, some members of Congress will attempt before the current
session ends to free up several million dollars as a signal to the
embattled nation that help is on the way.
</P>
<P>
   A car bomb that exploded Thursday in Bogota, killing seven and
injuring more than 50 people, has raised fears that drug lords
would once again carry out a terror campaign against civilians in
order to block extradition of suspected drug kingpins to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going back to the beginning of the 1990s in Colombia,
a time when these drug cartels destroyed the government,'' said
Luis Alberto Moreno, Colombia's ambassador to the United States.
``If President (Andres) Pastrana didn't have enough problems, this
is a new difficulty.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreno talked with several senior US officials Friday about the
possibility of pushing ahead with the three-year, $1 billion-plus
Colombian aid program, even though White House spokesmen said
earlier this week that it would have to be delayed until January.
</P>
<P>
   US Senator Paul Coverdell, a Georgia Republican who sponsored a
$1.5 billion aid plan for Colombia, said he believed it was
possible to release some ``symbolic'' funds now as a message to
Bogota that the United States was committed to the drug fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to do something, even if it's several million dollars,
and tell them that we will get it done completely next year,''
Coverdell said. ``The bombing is just an increased expression of
what we've deemed to be an emergency for months.''
</P>
<P>
   In Bogota, the bombing investigation continued Friday with
suspicion still squarely on narco-traffickers reacting to a Supreme
Court decision to extradite two accused traffickers. Two hours
after the bombing, Pastrana signed papers carrying out the
country's first three extraditions in nine years.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hammer, spokesman for the US National Security Council,
said he knew of no plans for additional funding for Colombia next
week, but added, ``If Congress is prepared to move more quickly,
we're prepared as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though there is strong bipartisan support for the Colombian
package, which would make the South American nation the third
largest recipient of US foreign aid, the proposal was stalled in
end-of-the-session funding negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   In Colombia, the delay has been a political blow to Pastrana,
analysts said. One front page headline this week in El Tiempo
pointedly said US assistance would have to wait ``until the next
century.''
</P>
<P>
   As Coverdell and others argue for some action now, US
Representative William Delahunt of Massachusetts believes that
delaying the larger package is best.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shouldn't be perceived as an unwillingness of the United
States to be engaged,'' Delahunt said. ``It should be seen as a
period of time to craft something that is thoughtful as well as
effective.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colombian package has come under intense debate within the
Clinton administration, with some favoring a plan weighted more
toward military hardware to fight guerrillas and narco-traffickers,
while others push for more economic and social incentives that they
believe would hasten a peace agreement with guerillas in Columbia's
30-year civil war.

HONDA S2000: THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 14)  
 (af)  
 By JAMES G. COBB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Another roadster, you say? Ho-hum. Been there, drove that.
</P>
<P>
   But hold your horsepower: Check out the Formula One-style
tachometer that arcs over the instrument displays of the Honda
S2000: The red line _ the limit of where the engine can safely be
run _ is just short of 9,000 revolutions per minute. That's surely
a mistake; only superbikes rev that fast. Doesn't the new Ferrari
Modena top out at 8,500 rpm?
</P>
<P>
   Glance at the interior. See the stubby six-speed shifter topped
by an egg-shaped aluminum knob, the two bolstered sport seats that
could hold you tight during a liftoff at Cape Canaveral, the red
button marked ``Start Engine'' like one in a racecar.
</P>
<P>
   Cast your eyes on the window sticker. It says that the engine is
a 2-liter, dual-cam four cylinder and that it churns out as much
horsepower _ 240 _ as many big V8s. There are no factory options.
The delivered price is $32,415. Surely that's a typo.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, your chances of getting an S2000 for 30-large are
probably not much better than winning the Lotto. Honda intends to
import just 5,000 roadsters a year, guaranteeing their scarcity.
And when dealers find themselves with a sizzling product, strong
demand and limited supplies, the list price becomes about as
revelant in a sales transaction as the mean April rainfall in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   But if ever there was a car over which one could grin while
being gouged, the S2000 might be it. In one tidy, top-down package,
it combines the simple pleasures of a Mazda Miata, the thrust of a
BMW M Roadster, the structural stiffness of a Corvette and the
tenacious grip of a Porsche Boxster.
</P>
<P>
   The engine is almost impossibly powerful for its size. The
brakes grab and hold like a snapping turtle. The shifter and
transmission are perhaps the quickest and crispest in any street
car anywhere. The driving position is close to perfect, and the
high-intensity projector headlamps shine like the truth.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first softtop Honda has sold in America. Except for
the $80,000 Acura NSX sports car, it is the first Honda since the
mid-1960s with rear drive, which purists consider essential in a
serious sports car. The S2000 weighs less than 2,800 pounds,
perfectly divided over front and rear.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be deceived by appearances. The long, chiseled hood and
shovelnose face suggest performance, but the pert, rounded rear
makes the S2000 seem a little too cute, even with dual exhausts so
big they surely mean business. People who obsess over cup holders
and think of shifting as moving a lever from P to D will not know
what they are getting themselves into.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a retro roadster, but a racecar in civilian clothes.
The S2000 makes you work a little; you must shift a lot around
town, though with this close-ratio transmission, that's more of a
reward than a chore. An automatic would ruin the experience, and
Honda will not even offer one.
</P>
<P>
   Most surprising, while the S2000 is a howling wolf when pushed
hard, it behaves in stop-and-go driving like a docile greyhound in
obedience school.
</P>
<P>
   All conversations about this car start and end with its engine.
Here is proof that Honda is, foremost, an engine company that just
happens to make cars, motorcycles and lawn mowers. It is also a
company with considerable success in racing, so it is no surprise
that the S2000, like the NSX, is packed with track-tested
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Honda's forte is small engines with big power, and in this
respect, the S2000's in-line four _ not shared with any other car _
sets a standard for the industry. The S2000 has more power per
liter than any normal-breathing production-car engine in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The engine also incorporates VTEC _ Honda's system of variable
valve timing and lift control, which guarantees the optimal
combustion of fuel and air regardless of engine speed. It is a
complex bit of engineering, but it works like magic, delivering
smooth power across a broad range of engine speeds despite what
seems, on paper, to be a lack of torque (just 153 foot-pounds at a
heady 7,500 rpm).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the S2000, the magician has a split personality.
The VTEC's special set of camshaft lobes don't come into play until
the engine is revving past 6,000 rpm. The S2000 just starts to roar
at a point where many engines are gasping near exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   The S2000 races from a standstill to 60 miles an hour in well
under 6 seconds, faster than a Boxster and about as quickly as a
Corvette. It can hit 150 mph on a racetrack. (Do not try this at
home.)
</P>
<P>
   Oh, did I mention that it goes 28 miles on a gallon of premium
unleaded? Or that it meets federal low-emission standards?
</P>
<P>
   This remarkable engine rests on a frame that exploits its full
potential, one that is rigid even by the standards of closed-top
cars, whose roofs help to prevent the bodies from flexing. Honda
uses the high driveline tunnel as a backbone, like an I-beam in a
skyscraper. In a Miata or BMW Z3, if you speed over a bumpy road or
barrel over railroad tracks, the body shakes like Little Richard's
piano. The S2000 is unruffled.
</P>
<P>
   With a structure so stiff, the independent suspension doesn't
have to compensate for twisting, so its various parts are tuned for
quick, precise handling. The electric steering is direct but never
twitchy. The car stays on course on the highway, and it seems to
ride invisible rails over serpentine roads, always flat and under
control.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the smiles it elicits, the S2000 demands to be taken
seriously. Consider the lack of amenities: there is no clock, no
ashtray or lighter, no glovebox or door pockets, no shutoff for the
passenger's air bag. (Dealers can install one.) The stereo is fair
with the top up and poor with the top down. The ride is noisy.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few gimmicks, like the start button you push after
turning the key. (Pity the non-English-speaking parking attendant
who couldn't figure this out, and resorted to pushing the car out
of its space and through a Manhattan garage.)
</P>
<P>
   And although the radio controls are close _ behind a lid that
jabbed my knee when it was open _ Honda put a second set by the
driver's left hand. The video-game tachometer is fun; the big
digital speedometer is as good as they get.
</P>
<P>
   All S2000s come with air-conditioning; cruise control; a stereo
with CD player; power windows, locks and mirrors; leather trim and
keyless entry. The power top zips down in just 6 seconds, though
the Miata's manual roof works just as well. Ask the dealer to
install a wind deflector behind the seats; it makes open-air
motoring more pleasant on chilly evenings.
</P>
<P>
   The rear window is plastic, easily scratched, with no defroster
wiring.
</P>
<P>
   Storage is lacking. Aside from a net in the passenger footwell,
there are just two inconvenient spaces for odds and ends. A console
is built into the rear wall at shoulder level _ don't even think of
rummaging there while driving _ and a tiny vertical compartment is
behind the driver's elbow. There is one cup holder. The snap-on
tonneau cover consumes much of the small trunk.
</P>
<P>
   The S2000 brings the roadster full circle. With the Miata, the
Japanese revived a British genre, which was then refined by the
Germans. With the S2000 _ and Toyota's coming MR2 Spyder _ Japan is
remaking the sports car, raising standards and lowering prices. If
roadsters can cure a midlife crisis, this may be a good time to
have one. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE TRACK: Take it out once and you'll drive it in your
dreams. &QL;

INS EXPULSIONS OF IMMIGRANTS IN HOUSTON ABOVE NATIONAL RATE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The number of illegal immigrants expelled by the
Immigration and Naturalization Service in Houston rose 29 percent
in the past year, far outstripping the rate nationally, INS
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston office expelled 6,792 illegal immigrants from the
country, compared to 5,280 in 1998. Nationally, INS expelled a
record 176,990 illegal immigrants in its 1999 fiscal year, compared
to 171,154 in 1998, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Houston was the only major Texas municipality that experienced a
rise in illegal-immigrant removals, a distinction state INS offices
attributed to the 60 consular offices and large state prison near
the city.
</P>
<P>
   The proximity of consular facilities enables Houston INS agents
to get travel documents for illegal immigrants quickly and thereby
speed the deportation process, said Kristi Barrows, spokesperson
for the Houston office.
</P>
<P>
   Also helping to increase Houston's expulsion figure is INS's
program for identifying, charging and initiating deportation
proceedings against illegal immigrants who are in state prisons for
committing crimes. The state prison in Huntsville, with a large
number of foreign-born inmates, provides a ready population of
illegal immigrants to be deported upon the completion of their
sentences, said Mariela Melero, spokesperson for INS's Dallas-based
Central region.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Houston, the agency's Dallas office had a 34
percent decline in the number of illegal immigrants it expelled.
San Antonio saw a drop of 14 percent, from 10,778 in 1998 to 9,264
this past year.
</P>
<P>
   El Paso and Harlingen each experienced drops of 6 percent. The
number of illegal immigrants expelled fell from 17,773 in 1999 to
16,769 last year in El Paso. In Harlingen, the drop was from 8,886
to 8,323, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   INS's data account for illegal immigrants removed at the order
of an immigration judge or officer during fiscal year 1999, which
ended Sept. 30. The figures include neither the 1.5 million illegal
immigrants apprehended at U.S. borders who voluntarily returned to
their home country nor the 72,000 immigrants in INS custody who
were allowed to leave the United States voluntarily after being
charged with violating immigration law.
</P>
<P>
   INS said the number of illegal immigrants deported in 1999 would
have been higher if not for the devastation of Hurricane Mitch,
which led the U.S. government to delay the deportation of Central
Americans to their ravaged homelands.
</P>
<P>
   Of the immigrants expelled nationwide in 1999, 62,359 _ or about
1,200 per week _ were removed after committing a crime in the
United States, INS said. Nearly half of those criminals, 47
percent, had committed drug offenses; 13 percent had simply
violated immigration laws; 6 percent had been convicted of assault;
and 5 percent had committed burglary.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, 89,035 illegal immigrants were deported when they
sought entry at U.S. ports with fraudulent, improper or no entry
documents, an increase of about 16 percent from 1998, INS said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the criminal immigrants removed, 19,592 were expelled upon
the completion of their prison sentences under INS's Institutional
Removal Program, which is targeted at seven states that account for
75 percent to 80 percent of foreign-born state inmates.
</P>
<P>
   The states are Texas, Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois,
New Jersey and New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very pleased that the exceptional efforts of INS field
personnel, combined with excellent cooperation from our federal
partners as well as state and local officials, have allowed us to
remove criminal aliens who have completed their sentences with
greater efficiency and effectiveness,'' INS Commissioner Doris
Meissner said.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican nationals accounted for the overwhelming majority, 83
percent, of people deported last year, INS reported.

BABY STEPS TOWARD ACCORD ON SOCIAL SECURITY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 14) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The country learned one main lesson this year from
the inability of President Clinton and Congress to make headway in
dealing with the long-term financial shortfall in Social Security:
that making even modest changes to the retirement system requires
far more political trust than is present in Washington today.
</P>
<P>
   Despite solemn promises from the White House and from Democrats
and Republicans in Congress not to use Social Security as a club to
batter the opposition, each side whacked away with abandon,
contending that it alone could be trusted to save retirees from
financial ruin.
</P>
<P>
   Lost in the partisan spectacle, however, were some promising
developments and even some enlightened debate on various issues. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DEBT REDUCTION About the only big fiscal agreement between the
two parties was that the bulk of the projected federal budget
surplus _ the $2 trillion in excess revenue that Social Security
will generate over the next decade _ should go toward reducing the
$3.6 trillion in national debt held by the public.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was largely a result of a well-founded fear that
using the Social Security surplus for anything else, like tax cuts
or government spending, would be painted as a wholesale betrayal of
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   That the outcome had beneficial economic effects, like lower
interest rates, was a happy byproduct of gridlock, not the goal.
</P>
<P>
   Still, using Social Security revenues to reduce the debt does
nothing to address the underlying long-term shortfall in the
retirement system's finances. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   STOCK INVESTMENTS The most divisive issue was whether
individuals should have the right and the responsibility to invest
a portion of their tax dollars in private accounts. Nearly all
Republicans and a few influential Democrats said yes. The vast
majority of Democrats said no.
</P>
<P>
   But that divide obscured a somewhat remarkable agreement among
almost all voices in the debate. From the most liberal to the most
conservative, they concluded that the power of the stock market to
generate substantial returns over the long run should be used to
help close the gap between the benefits that Social Security has
promised to today's workers and the system's ability to pay them.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Democrats in Congress said the Social Security
system itself, not individuals, should do the investing, so that
everyone would benefit or bear the risks equally. Advocates of
private accounts said individuals should have more control over
their financial futures, and that collective investment would
result in de facto government ownership of private industry.
</P>
<P>
   One way or another, Wall Street seems destined to play a role in
dealing with the problem. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE TRUST FUND Since its establishment during the New Deal,
Social Security has worked in the same way: Today's workers pay a
levy on their earnings; the revenue goes toward paying current
retirees. Any excess _ payroll tax revenue beyond what is
immediately needed to pay benefits _ is theoretically parked in a
trust fund that can be used down the road to pay benefits when
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the last year has it become clear to people other than
policy types and actuaries that the trust fund is basically an
accounting fiction. Excess Social Security revenue is not tucked
away in the sense that the phrase ``trust fund'' suggests. Because
of the way the government keeps its books, that excess can be used
in only three ways: for general government spending, as was done
each year until 1998; for a tax cut; or to reduce the national
debt, as is being done now.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how the excess is used, the government still deposits
an IOU in that amount with the Social Security system. The IOU is
nothing more than a promise to pay back the money, almost certainly
out of general tax receipts or through increased government
borrowing. The IOUs are not real assets like stocks or bonds, and
they do not even represent cash, since the government cannot
deposit cash with itself as if it were a bank.
</P>
<P>
   The trust fund now contains IOUs totaling $865 billion. The
amount is projected to peak at $4.5 trillion in 2022, when the
system will have to begin redeeming them to pay benefits to
retiring baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if benefits are to be maintained after 2022, the
government will either have to dip into general revenue or borrow
from the public to make good on the $4.5 trillion. And even so,
after the IOUs run out sometime around 2034, Social Security will
be able to pay only 75 percent of promised benefits unless changes
are made. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GENERATIONAL EQUITY Finally, there was a dawning recognition
that solving Social Security's problems would require tradeoffs
between the needs of today's workers _ overwhelmingly the baby
boomers, who are at a peak of political and economic influence _
and later generations.
</P>
<P>
   If the boomers cannot rally themselves to find a consensus and
make sacrifices and compromises now, the bill will be dumped into
the laps of their children and grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   And who is to say that they'll be in any mood to pay it?

 &HT;    Insurer criticized for mental health policy
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Consumer advocates expressed anger Friday over
UnitedHealth Group's exclusion of mental health services from its
new policy to let doctors have the final say on treatment
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's outrageous that they would set up a double standard,''
said Cynthia Wainscott, executive director of the National Mental
Health Association of Georgia. ``What they're saying is, they don't
trust doctors in mental health, but they trust them on heart or
kidney disease.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief executive of a UnitedHealth subsidiary said Thursday
that costs would escalate if the company stopped its reviews of
mental health treatment decisions. ``Mental health holds a lot more
intangibles than medical care in determining what treatment someone
needs,'' said Saul Feldman, chief executive of United Behavioral
Health.
</P>
<P>
   But UnitedHealth late Friday appeared to leave the door open for
eventually treating mental health equally.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a model in evolution,'' UnitedHealth said in a
statement, citing mental health as an area in transition.
UnitedHealth added it was committed to ``continuing this
evolution'' over all UnitedHealth segments in the next 12 to 18
months.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, UnitedHealth won widespread praise from
consumer and physician groups for giving doctors the power to
decide what's best for patients. The company explained Monday that
it costs the company more to review doctors' decisions
administratively than it would to cover the treatments in question.
</P>
<P>
   UnitedHealth said it spends $100 million a year to review
doctors' decisions, of which 99 percent are upheld. Doctors'
decisions still would be monitored under the new policy, but after
the treatment or service is performed.
</P>
<P>
   But Wainscott said that for mental health, studies have shown
that early and effective mental health treatment can reduce overall
medical costs. The pre-certification process required by insurers
can prevent suicidal people from receiving needed hospitalization
or consumers from getting sufficient visits to a psychotherapist,
Wainscott said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Bob Carolla, spokesman of the National Alliance for the
Mentally Ill: ``There should be no discrimination between physical
and mental care. It's an issue of science, fundamental fairness and
moral responsibility.'' He said the UnitedHealth policy could
violate mental health parity laws in 28 states.
</P>
<P>
   UnitedHealth also has drawn complaints in Georgia for not
providing benefits to some members who seek mental health services
from non-UnitedHealth providers. But the company denies it's
skirting a state law on ``point-of-service'' plans.
</P>
<P>
   The law states employees who have only an HMO option must also
be given a POS alternative, which allows some benefits for
treatments from out-of-network providers.
</P>
<P>
   UnitedHealth lets POS members go outside its network for general
physical care but not for mental health services, says the Georgia
Psychological Association. UnitedHealth says it complies with the
law by letting employers decide whether to cover care outside of
its network.
</P>
<P>
   The state insurance commissioner's office is looking into the
complaints, as is Cathey Steinberg, state insurance consumer
advocate.
</P>
<P>
   The ``point-of-service'' law applies to employers that don't
self-insure their benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota-based UnitedHealth has 14.5 million members.

MINDING HER MEMORIES TO PLAY A TROUBLED SOUL 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Nov. 14) 
(jt) 
 By JENNET CONANT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the pantheon of film actresses, Winona Ryder is becoming
almost as well known for her eyes as Bette Davis. Ms. Ryder's, of
course, are brown, not blue. On screen, they appear black, enormous
and extraordinarily expressive, bearing a striking similarity to
those of the cartoon character Princess Mononoke in the
Japanimation feature of the same name. Off screen, they look large,
but less unreal.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, they are fixed on the poster for her new film,
``Girl, Interrupted,'' which is based on Susanna Kaysen's
best-selling memoir of a two-year stay as a teenager at McLean
Hospital, the private psychiatric clinic outside Boston. The
poster, propped against the wall of Ms. Ryder's Manhattan hotel
room, is a stark photograph of the left side of the actress' face,
dominated by one huge, dark eye. As both the star and an executive
producer of ``Girl, Interrupted,'' Ms. Ryder, who scarcely looks of
legal age in a rumpled button-down shirt and khaki cargo pants, her
bare feet thrust into Air Nikes, has a say over everything from
casting and script changes to the movie's trailer and promotional
billboards. The studio, Columbia Pictures, is waiting for her
feedback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, what do you think?'' she asks. Her anxious gaze
scours every cluttered surface of the room, searching for a
cigarette. Because she woke up only minutes before a 4 p.m.
interview (she is shooting night scenes for her next movie,
``Autumn in New York'') and is nursing a cold, she settles for a
sip of Orange Zinger tea and two antihistamine pills. She smiles
wanly and, curling up on the sofa, explains why ``Girl,
Interrupted,'' six years in the making, has her feeling so jittery.
She has invested more of herself in this role, she says, than in
any other in her career because of the raw, painful nature of the
material and its very personal connection to her own life _ an
early bout of depression that she is talking about publicly for the
first time. For much of the movie, she is talking directly to a
Panavision camera only six inches from her nose. ``This is risky
for me,'' she says, nodding at the poster. ``I mean, if you don't
like me, you're not going to like this movie.''
</P>
<P>
   After a two-year absence from the screen, Ms. Ryder, 28, is
ready for another close-up. Beneath the fragile, waiflike exterior
is a surprisingly canny veteran. She has 24 films to her credit,
including Janusz Kaminski's ``Lost Souls,'' opening Jan. 14, and
two Academy Award nominations, for best actress in ``Little Women''
and best supporting actress in ``The Age of Innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   She has been working since the day she was discovered eating
gazpacho at a San Francisco restaurant when she was 12, and she
says she remains every bit as much in love with the movie business
today as she was then. While she has had her share of growing pains
(including an infamous case of the flu that forced her to back out
of Francis Ford Coppola's ``Godfather 3'') and tabloid romances (a
highly publicized liaison with the actor Johnny Depp, who had
``Winona Forever'' tattooed on his arm), she has weathered it all
with grace and humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going through adolescence on screen,'' she says, rolling
her eyes. ``I mean, most kids can have a bad day and miss school,
but I couldn't miss a day of work because that would be a $300,000
insurance day, blah, blah, blah.'' Ms. Ryder, who is known as Noni
to her friends, speaks of her awkward younger self without
embarrassment and giggles with delight while recounting some
humiliating anecdotes from her teens, suggesting that she has
emerged from her Hollywood childhood with few permanent scars. She
does not hide the fact that she is happily in love with the actor
Matt Damon and flushes like a schoolgirl when a waiter asks about
him.
</P>
<P>
   She launches into an account of her own episode of depression
with an enthusiasm quaintly at odds with her topic. She cheerfully
concedes that the pressure and exhaustion of making too many movies
in a row probably aggravated a fairly typical case of
postadolescent angst, as all the therapists she consulted
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Add a natural flair for drama and particularly bad typecasting
at an impressionable age. In her first three films, she was cast
successively as a geek (in ``Lucas''), the girl with glasses
(``Square Dance'') and a freaky witch (``Beetlejuice.'') It was not
until she took a leading part in ``Heathers'' in 1989, against her
agent's advice, that she finally played someone who was not
described in the script as ugly. ``I had been called that for so
long, I had just come to accept it as fact,'' says Ms. Ryder, who
resigned herself to a career playing oddballs and character roles.
</P>
<P>
   When the pale little string bean with the cropped black hair
blossomed into a delicate beauty, the ensuing identity crisis sent
her into a tailspin. ``Imagine my surprise,'' she says dryly,
``when I got breasts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Girl, Interrupted'' represents Ms. Ryder's return to the
screen in yet another coming-of-age story _ by now her stock in
trade _ only this time in a much grittier, more demanding role. As
the 18-year-old Susanna, who tried to cure a headache by washing
down 50 aspirin tablets with a pint of vodka, Ms. Ryder gives an
effectively understated performance as a young woman struggling to
find some shred of sanity in a world that is certifiable, both
inside and outside the hospital walls. Looking like a wounded
sparrow, her big, urgent eyes observing her parents' suburban
misery (vintage 1967) without comprehending it, she is too numb to
know or care where she is going when a doctor packs her off for a
long rest.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ryder did not have to research her role. Her brief stay in a
psychiatric ward when she was 20 is still a vivid memory. ``I was
overworked and overtired _ too tired to sleep,'' she recalls. ``I
was in a really bad state.'' The insomnia and anxiety attacks she
had been suffering on and off for years had become paralyzing. At
the tail end of a long, difficult parting with her first serious
boyfriend (she had left home to move in with Depp when she was 17),
she ``hit bottom,'' she says, and checked herself into a hospital.
She signed herself out a week later, feeling she had not been
helped.
</P>
<P>
   But she was never self-destructive, she says. Her parents, who
permitted her to work only during summer vacations while she was in
high school, told her that they, too, had suffered from depression
at her age. ``I didn't do drugs; I didn't get loaded,'' Ms. Ryder
says. ``But the depression. The worst part of it was not being able
to describe it _ the overwhelming horror of the anxiety attacks _
even to my own family, to the people closest to me.'' She had all
the classic symptoms: ``My breathing would get labored; everything
would start speeding up, and I'd get very scared. The closest I
ever came to describing it was that feeling when you almost get in
a car wreck and you swerve, and for a second there are needles in
your head and needles in your body. It's that moment, but stretched
out.''
</P>
<P>
   She makes it very clear that she blames no one, especially Depp,
for something she was doing to herself. She finally made a
breakthrough while she was in Portugal on a particularly grueling
shoot on ``The House of the Spirits,'' in which she played a
character who is tortured. ``I remember I came home one night and
looked at myself in the mirror and saw myself looking so battered,
and I thought, `Wow, this is what I am doing to myself inside,'''
she recalls. She is forever indebted, she says, to ``a really
excellent shrink,'' who was treating her long distance by
telephone, for helping her realize that she could portray pain on
the screen without having to put herself through it continually.

NASCAR DEAL BAD FOR THE NFL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a bigger story behind Friday's story about NASCAR
entering billion-dollar contracts with NBC, Fox, and Turner Sports.
While sports fans were looking at the $$$$$$$$$, a more important
story was the number of years involved in the deals.
</P>
<P>
   NBC and NASCAR have partnered until 2006 to air races every
Sunday in the fall. What does this mean to the NFL? Plenty. The
NFL's contracts with ABC, CBS, and Fox run through 2005. By taking
NASCAR on its network through 2006, NBC has taken itself out of the
pro football mix for the forseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL will not have NBC to use as ``leverage'' in the bidding
wars for television rights. This is going to hurt the NFL. Since
Fox became a major player, the NFL has had four networks bidding
for three packages: ``Monday Night Football,'' the AFC, and the
NFC. With NBC out of the mix, there is no one on the horizon for
the NFL to use as leverage to make the other three networks
competitively bid for these packages.
</P>
<P>
   Also, if NBC is airing NASCAR on Sunday afternoons in the fall
for the next six years, that should end any more talk of starting
another pro football league. Supposedly, NBC and Turner were
together going to coordinate a new league to play in the fall, but
that isn't likely to happen now.

   Things are not so happy in our local version of Happy Valley,
according to Fearless Fred Edelstein, the intrepid NFL insider who
has been putting out his weekly reports on pro football longer than
anyone in the business. Here is what Fearless Fred had to say in
one of his latest reports:
</P>
<P>
   Headline: ``Patriot Players Fear Winning Will Backfire And Bail
Out Carroll.''
</P>
<P>
   Text: ``The Patriots are off to a fine start, but our player
sources on the team say the club has hardly rallied around Pete
Carroll. If anything, the player sources we've talked to say the
downside of the winning in their minds is that they may be bailing
out Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``These sources say there's a strong undercurrent of a lack of
respect inside the locker room for Carroll. One story widely known
among players had to do with a veteran who wasn't able to make
Carroll's long-distance run in training camp when a doctor ordered
him to skip it because of an injury. Initially, Carroll refused to
allow the player to miss the run. Then, as the story goes, Carroll
asked the player to meet him on the practice field early the next
morning. When the player arrived, Carroll had a big bottle of water
with him. We're told Carroll threw the water on the player, which
gave the impression of sweat, and said: `Tell everybody you ran.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Offered one player source: `How do you respect a coach like
that? If he'll do that with one player, what are we supposed to
think about what he is doing with somebody else?' ''
</P>
<P>
   A top Patriot official denies the water-bottle episode ever
happened. Fearless Fred, in a phone conversation with this humble
reporter Friday, said he knew for a fact that it did happen.
</P>
<P>
   Fred II:
</P>
<P>
   In his latest report this week, Fearless Fred has another
unhappy nugget involving Ben Coates. The story begins late last
season when Coates went home to Carolina for the death of a
relative days before the St. Louis game, Dec. 13, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Reportedly, owner Bob Kraft dispatched a private plane to take
Coates from the site of the service to St. Louis the morning of the
game. Instead, Coates used the plane to return to the Boston area.
At the start of this season, when Coates received his first major
paycheck, there was a large sum of money missing. When he inquired
about it, Coates was told a deduction was made for taking the
private plane back to Boston instead of St. Louis. Big Ben was not
pleased.
</P>
<P>
   Management later said it was a mistake, and Coates was
reimbursed the money, but not before his teammates took up a
collection to bail him out.

   There will be no new parquet floor for the FleetCenter. The
Celtics and the FleetCenter will continue to keep polishing, so to
speak, the legendary playing surface that has been in place since
the start of the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We (Fleet) have come to an understanding with the Celtics that
both of us own the floor,'' says FleetCenter CEO Rich Kreswick.
``And both of us want to retain as much of it as we possibly can
for the future. For years we have been replacing certain parts of
the floor as they have worn out. Now we are looking at a complete
overhaul of the floor, rather than doing it a piece at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every part of the floor that is still in good shape will be
kept. We are going to preserve as much of the leprechaun as we
possibly can. Our goal is to eliminate the parts of the floor that
could be dangerous to players _ places that are worn down or
uneven.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't remember what year it was _ probably 1968 or 1969 because
Bill Russell was coaching the team. The Celtics went to Providence
to play a home game against the Cincinnati Royals. They did this
from time to time in those days because Lou Pieri, who owned the
old Providence Arena, was part of the Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   When the teams arrived, the arena manager was telling them how
great it was going to be to play on the new floor just installed
for this contest. However, there turned out to be a slight problem.
No one removed the preserving wax from the floor when it was put
together. As a result, when the teams came out to warm up, they
looked as if they were trying to play basketball on skates. They
were slipping and sliding all over the place. The players on both
sides (can you imagine this happening today?) got towels, got down
on all fours, and stripped the wax off the floors as best they
could.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the dangerous situation, the teams agreed not to go
hard to the basket and, in particular, not to knock down anyone
going to the basket for fear of serious injury. The game was played
at three-quarter speed. The Celtics won and then, to end the day,
walked out of the building into a blizzard.
</P>
<P>

   Here's an interesting spin on the NHL's Alexei Yashin case from
Paul Weiler, a professor at the Harvard Law School. Weiler is
perhaps the top sports law expert in the country. He has put out a
book each year this decade and has another, just finished this
week, coming out in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the players' union in hockey should do something right
now to help prevent another player doing what Yashin has done in
Ottawa,'' said Weiler, who is consulted by just about every
players' union in the business. Yashin, a top center with a
long-term, guaranteed contract, refused to report to the Senators
unless they gave him a new deal. This week, Ottawa suspended him
for the rest of the season for not living up to his contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Yashin has done can only hurt the rest of the players
down the line. Before the fact, an owner is the one who pays the
price. He has to take an educated guess at how good that player is
going to be over a certain period of time. The owner puts up the
money, and if the player does not perform up to expectations, the
owner still has to pay the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The owner never knows for sure what he is going to get. The
player, on the other hand, once he signs, knows he is guaranteed to
get all of the money. Then some players, as it is in the Yashin
case, and I guess with Barry Sanders in football, decide not to
live up to the contract. The owner gets injured, and he has done
nothing wrong. This is a terrible message for everyone. Down the
road, if situations like this continue to come up, owners will not
want to be taking those kind of risks, and this will come back to
hurt other players in the future. The owners will pay the players
less. The union should step up and take the posture that once a
player signs that binding contract, he has an obligation to fulfill
that commitment.''

   Nice touch at Boston College this  &UR; afternoon &LR; . Before kickoff,
John J. Burns Jr., Class of '53, will endow a fund, in the name of
Mike Holovak, which will pay for another graduate assistant
football coach at Boston College. Burns played for Holovak when
Mike was the Eagles' coach from 1951-59 . . . Pat Burns called it
playing ``soft'' when the Bruins got whacked, 6-2, in Buffalo
Wednesday. But the greater embarrassment was the way his teammates
stood around and did nothing when goalie Rob Tallas was upended
with a cheap shot by Miroslav Satan, who should have had his butt
handed to him. But not one of Tallas's teammates did a thing. So
you know when the going gets tough this season, this Bruins team is
going to be ducking.

   The Red Sox will visit the Dominican Republic in the spring, but
they've played in the Caribbean before. In 1967, the Sox and
Yankees played two exhibition games in the Virgin Islands, but the
excursion was a fiasco. When the teams arrived, they discovered
there were no baseball fields, so they had to play on a converted
cricket field. When Yankees manager Ralph Houk and Sox skipper Dick
Williams saw what they had on their hands, the teams met at home
plate and agreed there would be no sliding. With no mound, pitchers
were told to throw fastballs and not risk arm injury. The hitters
were told to hit the first pitch that looked good, whenever
possible. The right-field wall could not have been more than 250
feet away. There was a hospital across the street behind the wall.
Some of the Yankees' lefthanded batters had fun in batting
practice, hitting rockets over the wall, across the street, and off
the hospital wall. The Yanks won the first game, 3-1, and the Sox
took the second, 13-4. Those of us who covered the games were
punchy when they were over after listening to a band, stationed 20
feet away from what was supposed to be a press box, play nonstop
throughout the game.

   Ohio State basketball coach Jim O'Brien is a gamer. Obie was
supposed to fly to Boston to speak to the Boston University
basketball team as a favor to old friend Dennis Wolff, but he
injured his back and couldn't fly. In fact, he couldn't coach his
team in a game Wednesday night. So O'Brien, propped up so he could
stand, made a videotaped speech that was flown overnight to Boston
and played for the team and the alumni at the basketball tip-off
dinner . . . Ted Johnson expects to be back in the Patriots' lineup
the second week in December, which could be big for the team as it
conceivably heads into the playoffs. Johnson still doesn't have
full strength back in his injured left biceps and wants to get
banged around a little in practice before he tries to play in a
game . . . The alleged dominance of the NFC is over. The AFC has a
24-12 edge thus far in interconference games, and if the pace
continues, the AFC will have the biggest edge ever in the rivalry .
. . One of the most important games of the Patriots' season takes
place Sunday, and New England is not involved. The Bills-Dolphins
game in Buffalo will have a major impact on the AFC East race.
Miami has beaten the Patriots in New England and the Colts in
Indianapolis, and if they beat the Bills on the road, they would
appear to be a lock to win the division.

 UNDATED: it continually.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Working with Meryl Streep, one of her co-stars in ``The House of
the Spirits,'' was also a revelation. ``She would come to work
every day and do these really heart-wrenching scenes, and then go
home to her four children and husband and a wonderful life,'' Ms.
Ryder says. ``And I was thinking I had to stay in this heightened
state of fear and depression to emote.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Ryder was 21, she was given Ms. Kaysen's book in galley
form by her father, Michael Horowitz, a rare-book dealer and an
archivist of counterculture literature. (Ryder is her professional
name.) She immediately identified with the author's poignant
account of her own fraught passage into womanhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just coming out of my very serious depression, and I
didn't know what to label it, just as Susanna doesn't know what to
label hers,'' she says. She was determined to play Susanna and
tried to option the film rights. When she learned that a producer
at Columbia Pictures had beaten her to it, she says, she used her
clout to take over the project, persuading the studio to let her
star and take an active role in the production.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kaysen's darkly comic, impressionistic book, which has
virtually no plot, did not easily translate to film. Ms. Ryder
persevered through several directors and innumerable rewrites
before entrusting the project to James Mangold, who was then
completing his second film, the macho police drama ``Cop Land.''
But Ms. Ryder had been impressed by his directorial debut,
``Heavy,'' an independent film about an obese chef's obsessive love
for a woman he could never have. Deeply moved by the film, she was
convinced that Mangold could pull off a tough but tender
investigation of a confusing time in a young woman's life that
would remain true to the spirit of Ms. Kaysen's book.
</P>
<P>
   Mangold says he hated the adaptation she sent him but was
captivated by Ms. Ryder herself: ``It turned out we both loved
silent films _ all the things that aren't said on screen. Noni is a
genuine silent movie actress. She can reveal things, with just her
eyes, with a delicacy that is indescribable. I also saw that she
wanted to reach further, and as a director, I wanted to take her
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Because she was already an avid student of depression _ she can
quote freely from a heavily underlined copy of William Styron's
memoir, ``Darkness Visible'' _ Mangold discouraged her from
becoming too caught up in the diagnostic literature. ``She never
got lost in the material,'' he says. ``Because she was operating
from experiences she had had, instead of from intellectual
parallels, she spent a lot of time just remembering what it was
like to be very deep inside herself. She gives a wonderful
performance because she understood that the point of the book is
that crazy isn't all that different than normal, just a slightly
amplified or skewed way of viewing things.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kaysen, who visited the set, was struck by Ms. Ryder's
commitment to getting every detail just right. ``She's a
perfectionist, and she drives herself very hard,'' the author
observes.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Ryder admits she worried at times that making the
movie might push her over the edge _ particularly in the three
cold, gray months of filming in an empty wing of a state hospital
in Harrisburg, Pa. _ her colleagues credit her with keeping them
sane. (The supporting cast includes Angelina Jolie as her psychotic
pal, Whoopi Goldberg as the no-nonsense ward nurse, and Vanessa
Redgrave as the chief psychiatrist.) ``She has a completely
paradoxical personality,'' says Jack Green, the director of
photography. ``In certain ways, she has this incredible innocence,
and yet she is so strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Denise Di Novi, who first worked with Ms. Ryder when the actress
was 14 and has produced three of her movies (``Heathers,'' ``Edward
Scissorhands'' and ``Little Women''), says Ms. Ryder was unlike any
teenager she had ever met. ``She started out with more strength of
character and centeredness about her own instincts and beliefs than
most adults ever have,'' Ms. Di Novi says. ``She was always very
comfortable with not being average.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ryder concedes that before puberty, she was supremely
self-confident. She attributes that confidence to her parents, whom
she describes as 1960s intellectual beatniks. ``I don't know how to
say this without sounding weird, but they kind of worshiped me,''
she says with a fond giggle.
</P>
<P>
   The third of four children (she has an older half-sister and
half-brother, and a younger brother, Uri, an actor, who shares her
house in Los Angeles), Ms. Ryder spent her early childhood in San
Francisco, where her father took her on his rounds of protests,
poetry readings and regular visits to the poet Allen Ginsberg's
apartment. Her mother, Cindy, a writer and editor, often kept her
precocious daughter home to watch classic black-and-white movies.
Schooled on gangster pictures and film noir, Ms. Ryder chose as her
movie idol James Cagney.
</P>
<P>
   After spending four years in a northern California commune, the
Horowitzes moved to Petaluma, Calif., and enrolled their children
in public school. On the first day, Ms. Ryder, who was entering the
seventh grade, knew it was going to be a disaster. She had worn her
beloved Cagney attire, complete with crew cut, thrift-shop suit,
white shirt and tie. It did not go over well. On the third day of
school, she says, she was beaten up by a group of students, who
slammed her head against a locker and called her ``a faggot.'' She
was bandaged in the nurse's office and sent home. ``They kicked me
out and asked me not to come back,'' she says. ``They said I was a
distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   She was put on home study, and to occupy her afternoons, her
parents suggested she apply to the drama school affiliated with San
Francisco's American Conservatory Theater. At her audition, she
performed a monologue from J.D. Salinger's novel ``Franny and
Zooey.'' By the end of her first year, the 12-year-old misfit had
her own agent. ``So I have those kids to thank for where I am
today,'' she says, arching her elegant brows.
</P>
<P>
   Today, her sense of social obligation has spurred her to produce
a documentary on Leonard Peltier, an American Indian who has spent
the last 25 years in prison for his part in a shooting incident
during which two FBI agents were killed. The project is based in
part on Peter Mathiesson's book ``The Spirit of Crazy Horse.'' But
she is not averse to a big, glamorous Hollywood role. In the
romantic comedy ``Autumn in New York,'' she plays a beautiful young
woman who has only a year to live and chooses to have her last
fling with Richard Gere as a jaded playboy. ``The age difference is
actually an issue in the movie,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Though she is the iconoclastic offspring of anti-establishment
parents, Ms. Ryder is not a rebel. She fully enjoys the bourgeois
fruits of stardom, including a house in Beverly Hills, a
beautifully furnished New York apartment (on loan to a friend) and
a closet full of designer clothes. She is also not above throwing
her name around to get what she wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to business, she is not that delicate
creature,'' says the screenwriter Jay Cocks, who wrote the
adaptation of ``The Age of Innocence.'' He recalls a dinner during
which a famous director tried in vain to persuade her to take the
lead in a remake, something she objects to on principle. ``He kept
telling her to take the money, but he couldn't convince her,''
Cocks says, noting that Ms. Ryder has also turned down countless
offers to reprise Audrey Hepburn roles (including, reportedly, the
famously unsuccessful 1995 remake of ``Sabrina,'' which starred
Julia Ormond.) ``She has fantastic confidence in her own judgment,
which she should have, because she has very good taste.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she knows ``Girl, Interrupted'' may be a difficult
sell, she is hoping her star power will help it find an audience.
``This movie will be an example,'' Ms. Ryder says. ``If it does
well, the studios may be inclined to make more personal movies and
take more chances. Those are the movies that always end up being
classics.'' And she has always wanted to be in a classic.

AS THE STOCK RALLY BROADENS, THE ROLE OF THE FED BANK GROWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release, Sunday, Nov.14)  (DW) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's some good news ahead of the meeting of Federal Reserve
policy makers on Tuesday: The stock market rally is broadening.
More stocks are doing better _ or at least not as poorly as they
once were _ compared with the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index.
</P>
<P>
   Strategists are generally more comfortable with a broader
market; a market with narrow leadership is often headed for a fall.
</P>
<P>
   According to one measure, the Laggards indicator produced by
Jeffrey M. Warantz, equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney, 58.8
percent of 7,598 common stocks are trailing the performance of the
S&AMP;P 500 by 15 percentage points or more over the last 12 months.
But that is down from a record 77.1 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
   More evidence of the broadening is seen in the Russell 2000
index, which measures smaller-company stocks and is up 17.3 percent
from its low for the year in March. On a wider scale, Warantz said
companies with market capitalizations of $10 billion or less were
up 15.6 percent, on average, in the second and third quarters of
this year. This performance of midcap to small-cap stocks compares
with an average decline of 4 percent for companies with
capitalizations of more than $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That broadening has occurred while the Federal Reserve has been
raising its short-term interest rate target, to 5.75 percent from
5.25 percent. Another increase is possible on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   While the Fed was raising its target three full percentage
points between February 1994 and February 1995, this index jumped
to 44.4 percent from 28.6 percent, meaning that the leadership of
the market narrowed significantly as investors chose to switch into
the most liquid, big-company stocks that have good, long-term
earnings records.
</P>
<P>
   What does all this mean?
</P>
<P>
   One interpretation is that even though the market has broadened,
the improvement has been only from the narrowest market since the
indicator was created in 1971. Now at 58.8 percent, the indicator
is still well above the average of 34.9 percent and at the
fourth-highest point since 1971. By this interpretation, the
performance since May is not as positive as it looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market was excruciatingly narrow at its worst and it is
still narrow at its best,'' said Byron R. Wien, U.S. investment
strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   Another interpretation is that this is just another market
indicator that worked in the past but isn't working now. That is
the story for many of the guides that equity strategists and Fed
policy makers have been using to help them understand the
performance of the stock market and the economy in the last half of
the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, 1987 and 1990, this indicator peaked and the stock
market had a big fall. This time, that hasn't happened yet.
</P>
<P>
   Or the index is proving that investors in general are still
confident about the outlook for stocks _ and probably more
confident than they were several months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The economy is growing strongly, while inflation still appears
in check. Third-quarter operating earnings for the S&AMP;P 500 have
risen 22 percent, according to the First Call Corp., and the
forecast for growth in the fourth quarter is 18 percent. Further,
the outlook for avoiding Year 2000 computer problems is improving.
</P>
<P>
   That optimism could change if the Fed raises interest rates
again. The October increase of 0.3 percent in the Producer Price
Index for finished goods, excluding food and energy, was bigger
than expected and revived worries about a Fed rate increase. But
strong productivity numbers and moderate retail sales data,
reported on Friday, seemed to calm investors.
</P>
<P>
   With a third quarter-point rate increase, the Fed would erase
the three quarter-point cuts made in the fall of 1998 to counter
the impact of Russia's bond default, the near collapse of a major
hedge fund and the deepening global financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   That would set the stage for new concern. Investors may find a
third rate increase tolerable because they were just taking back
the largess of 1998. But if the economy does not slow down, the
speculation will turn to where the Fed goes from here. That means
the real test for stocks and bonds won't come until after this
third rate increase.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Peter F. Drucker, revered as the father of modern
management, has a new message for corporate executives: Find
another line of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unique 20th-century creation, the corporation, is not
going to survive in the 21st century,'' he said, almost
nonchalantly, in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Big companies, he said, don't seem to be able to thrive for more
than 30 years, not even those like General Motors and Sears,
Roebuck that have received advice from management gurus like
himself. But another reason is seemingly contradictory: management
skills have advanced so far that business has lost some of its
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``In business, you are becoming bored, because we know so
much,'' he said. ``When I came in, nobody knew the routine and that
made it exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Few people in business today can remember when Drucker appeared
as a management visionary in the 1940s. Drucker turns 90 this
Friday, and that is prompting celebrations and reflections on his
life and work.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, 400 people, many from nonprofit organizations he
has advised, held a birthday party at the Getty Center here. On
Friday, Drucker, a native of Austria, received that country's Cross
of Honor for Science and Art. And at least two books have appeared
in the last few years assessing his life and work.
</P>
<P>
   Drucker wears hearing aids in both ears and walks with the help
of a cane. But his mind seems as fertile and his pen as fluid as
ever. He teaches a course for midcareer executives at the Claremont
Graduate School, east of Los Angeles, where he has been based since
1971.
</P>
<P>
   He spouts facts, figures and historical tidbits from memory. The
author of 31 books, he has recently written major articles for
magazines like The Atlantic Monthly and The Economist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Writing is a compulsive neurosis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Drucker made his mark by viewing management as a subject in its
own right, rather than as a collection of specific skills like
finance and accounting. ``He was the first person to formulate
management as a professional discipline,'' said D. Quinn Mills, a
professor at Harvard Business School.
</P>
<P>
   Drucker recognized early on that a key to corporate success was
to motivate employees. He also stressed marketing and innovation
over finance.
</P>
<P>
   His books, a mix of pungent generalizations and historical
trivia, have been criticized as lacking academic rigor. Some
business leaders consider his ideas dated. But his fans have
included John F. Welch Jr. of General Electric and Andrew S. Grove
of Intel. He also has a huge following among industrialists who
rebuilt Japan after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``We owe him very, very much,'' said Masatoshi Ito, the founder
of Ito-Yokado _ a large Japanese retailer that controls the
7-Eleven chain _ who came to the birthday party at the Getty Center
and helped organize one in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Drucker does not like to be typecast as a management guru. He
has written nearly as many books about economics, society and
politics as about management. He has even penned two novels. He is
an expert on Japanese art and once taught a course in it. Early in
his career, he worked as a banker and a journalist.
</P>
<P>
   Born and raised in Vienna, Drucker received his doctorate in
international law from Frankfurt University before he was 22 and
then remained in Germany. In 1933, after one of his essays was
banned and burned by the the Nazi government, Drucker moved to
London and then, in 1937, to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In 1944, after publishing a book about business and society, he
received an invitation from General Motors to study its inner
workings. That led to his first management book, ``The Concept of
the Corporation,'' in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   He now does his consulting and writing at home, in the modest
house in Claremont where he has lived for 29 years. He reads
voraciously, both fiction and history, and does much of his writing
on legal pads or a typewriter rather than on a computer, which he
says makes him write too fast.
</P>
<P>
   Doris Drucker, his wife of 62 years, is a writer and physicist
who has designed and manufactured a device to aid in speech
therapy. The couple have four children and six grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   As for his view on the demise of corporations, Drucker says
people will still work for a living but will not cast their lives
with a single company. What Drucker calls the knowledge workers of
today will save their best efforts for nonprofit social service
organizations, where they can make a bigger difference. ``The 20th
century was the century of business,'' he said. ``The next century
is going to be the century of the social sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Drucker, spending an increasing portion of his time with such
service groups, is the honorary chairman of the New York-based
Peter F. Drucker Foundation for Nonprofit Management, founded by
leaders of other nonprofit organizations that he advised.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is fascinated by the Internet, Drucker says his
choice for the growth industry of the next 30 years is not
e-commerce. ``It's going to be fish farming,'' he said, explaining
that on the oceans, ``we are still hunters and gatherers.''
</P>
<P>
   Claremont, which named its business school after Drucker, is now
establishing his archives under the direction of Nan Stone, a
former editor of Harvard Business Review. The archives will be
largely available online, so Drucker's insights will be available
to corporate managers well into the next century, even if the
corporations themselves don't survive.

   Ready to Roll Out An $18,000 Barrel &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How far can tequila, the rough-and-tumble party animal of
distilled spirits, take its image upmarket for the millennium? One
manufacturer is aiming pretty high.
</P>
<P>
   The drinking world is about to meet 1800 Millennium Single
Barrel, a limited-edition version that the marketer, UDV North
America, will sell only by the barrelful _ and you get the barrel,
too.
</P>
<P>
   UDV, the unit of Diageo that also markets regular 1800 tequila
and Jose Cuervo Gold, the best-selling brand, wants consumers to
think of tequila in general and 1800 in particular as a refined
libation worthy of being swirled in a brandy snifter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is meant to be sipped and savored, not served in a
margarita,'' said Steve Goldstein, a UDV spokesman, about the 1800
Millennium. ``In fact, anyone who would mix it should face prison
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The company hopes to tap into the lucrative growth of so-called
superpremium drink brands at a time when most liquor categories are
flat or declining in popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are feeling good, stocks are up, houses are
appreciating, and people are spending,'' said Frank Walters,
director of research at M. Shanken Communications in New York,
which publishes trade journals for the liquor industry.
</P>
<P>
   Each buyer gets a handmade barrel and all the 80-proof tequila
that was aged in it, packaged in 288 personalized bottles.
Cachet-seeking restaurants, hotels and liquor retailers are
expected to buy most of the 200-barrel production run and resell
the tequila to the public at about $60 a bottle, more than four
times what Jose Cuervo Gold typically fetches.
</P>
<P>
   But the company says it is not too late for a tequila fancier to
plunk down $18,000 or so and stock the cellar with a personal
barrelful.

SCRUTINY OF RESEARCH GRANTS STEPPED UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At academic centers around the country, including Harvard
Medical School this week, charges of misuse of federal research and
training funds are increasingly leading to internal scrutiny and
stepped-up efforts to monitor compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Within the coming days, for instance, the dean of the Harvard
Medical School plans to announce the creation of a compliance
committee to the faculty, on the heels of the resignation this week
of a nationally known aging specialist from a top administrative
post, after the application of one of her grants was questioned.
</P>
<P>
   And the association representing the nation's medical colleges
and teaching hospitals has recently created a new group to focus on
research compliance, to ensure that people who participate in
studies are protected and that federal funds are properly used.
</P>
<P>
   These efforts come after a US crackdown that has resulted in
millions of dollars nationwide being returned by institutions
alleged to have misused funds, and individual researchers being
charged.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring, for instance, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center in Boston returned $920,000 to the US government to settle a
suit and stepped up its research compliance program, after denying
allegations that research funds were being misused. And last month,
a New York scientist was charged with using drug abuse research
funds for personal purposes, like buying CDs and hiring people to
work on a book manuscript.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to address research compliance ``in a really
integrated and cohesive way is fairly new, and perhaps precipitated
by these problems,'' acknowledged Allan Shipp, assistant vice
president for biomedical and health sciences research for the
Association of American Medical Colleges, which represents medical
schools and teaching hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the need for such an effort is the increasing
regulatory complexity and financial pressures on academic medical
centers, perhaps leading some institutions to use funds for
purposes other than those specified in a grant, Shipp said. In the
September issue of the association's journal, ``Academic
Medicine,'' a special article highlighted some of the common abuses
of federal research grants, and ways to avoid them through research
compliance programs.
</P>
<P>
   A prominent patient and consumer advocate, Dr. Sidney Wolfe,
director of Public Citizen's Health Research Group, agreed that
``there's been a huge change in culture in medical schools and
teaching hospitals'' in terms of how research funding is viewed
because of these other pressures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money that's supposed to be spent on one thing is spent for
something else,'' Wolfe said. But he added, ``This is not to say
that that legitimizes it and exonerates anyone from blame.''
</P>
<P>
   At Harvard Medical School, a five-year training grant in the
amount of $416,000 in fiscal 1999 came into question after some of
the money was apparently not used according to the grant's terms,
and diverted to other research purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeanne Y. Wei, 50, principal investigator on the grant,
resigned this week as head of the school's division of aging and as
head of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center's division of
gerontology, days after Harvard University reported concerns about
the grant to federal officials, The Boston Globe reported Friday.
Wei, who could not be reached for comment, retains her position as
associate professor at the medical school and her research and
medical appointments at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Don L. Gibbons, associate dean for the school's office of public
affairs, said Harvard Medical School Dean Joseph B. Martin has
``over the past few weeks. . .been planning a compliance committee
that he'll be announcing to the faculty in the coming days.''
</P>
<P>
   But when asked if that was in response to an investigation into
Wei's grant, Gibbons said, ``This conversation is not about Dr.
Wei, it's about compliance.'' He declined to comment on why Wei
resigned, or whether there has been any investigation into Wei's
grants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have for a while been looking at our compliance issues to
make sure they're as good as they can be,'' Gibbons said. ``We've
always taken compliance very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center also say they
have always taken compliance seriously, even before the $920,000
repayment to the US government in April, to settle a case alleging
misuse of research funds. But Leon Goldman, director of the
hospital's office for business conduct, acknowledged that they have
stepped up implementing a comprehensive research compliance program
as part of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Goldman said, such settlements with the US government
by academic medical centers around the country prompt ``all health
care providers, academic, for-profit or not-for-profit, to be
diligent in what they do.''

HARVARD LAW GRADUATE   GIVES $5 MILLION FOR FELLOWSHIPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Trying to reverse a steep decline in the number of
promising students who go into public service, an alumnus has given
$5 million to endow fellowships at the Harvard Law School that will
pay the student loans of graduates who commit to work in
government.
</P>
<P>
   As tuition has gone up, so have student debt loads. But as
salaries have gone up in the private sector, salaries in government
have remained relatively flat. Combined with a distaste for
government service, school officials say, fewer and fewer students
want to work in the public sector.
</P>
<P>
   With the new Heyman fellowships, Harvard is trying to make
service to the federal government not only more financially viable,
but also more prestigious.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debt is so high these days, that it's kind of hard for
people who don't live with that kind of debt to understand how hard
it is,'' said Margo Schlanger, a 1993 Yale Law graduate who worked
in the Justice Department before returning to Harvard as an
assistant professor. ``This will at least get people thinking about
ways to work in public service. It eases the debt burden, it
encourages them to think hard about it in a way that makes it feel
prestigious. It endorses what is a good opportunity as a good
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The fellowships, endowed by Samuel J. Heyman, a former
government lawyer who went on to be a billionaire chief executive
of GAF Corp., will select 20 fellows a year, who will receive
honoraria and help paying off student loans. The program will also
set up conferences for fellows to share their experience, and also
with senior government officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gift will reinvigorate the School's rich tradition of
public service by graduates at the Federal level,'' said Dean
Robert Clark. ``Perhaps this program will produce the next
Elizabeth Dole or Archibald Cox.''
</P>
<P>
   Interest in public service jobs hit a peak in 1975 just after
the Watergate scandal, when 49 Harvard Law School graduates went to
Washington to take jobs with the federal government. Last spring,
that number was down to 7, the low point of a steady decline. The
percentage dropped nationwide, too, from about 20 percent to about
13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The decline began not least with the increasing burden of
student loans, and the increase in salaries in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, students who went to work for the federal government
and those who went to work for a Boston law firm earned about the
same amount, $60,000, after taxes and student loans, their first
year. At a New York law firm, a graduate would earn about $91,000
after taxes and loans, according to Harvard career office data.
</P>
<P>
   But the gap between public and private sector salaries has
increased enormously. Now, a student who goes to work for the
government earns about $51,000 after taxes and loans, while one who
works in a Boston law firm earns $103,000, and in a New York firm,
$146,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students often get out with $80,000, $100,000 in debt,''
Schlanger said. ``That's $12,000-$16,000 in loan payments every
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard already offers loan forgiveness for those who go into
low paying jobs, but those who earn more than $50,000 are not
eligible for it. People who enter government service are paid just
slightly more, but not enough to make the job seem attractive, or
even affordable.
</P>
<P>
   The program is to be administered by Philip Heymann, a Harvard
Law graduate who worked in several positions in the Justice
Department for the Clinton Administration before returning to
Harvard as a professor.

   Many Americans are going to have a hard time swallowing the 25
grams of soy protein required to fight heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   To meet the level the U.S. Food and Drug Administration says is
required to scrub bad cholesterol out of arteries, it would take
four servings of soy products a day _ one serving at breakfast,
another at lunch, then dinner, and a snack. That's a lot of
processed bean product for a nation in love with meat and potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   But there is hope.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate America responded to the explosion of scientific
interest in the health benefits of soy with a plethora of products
_ faux chicken wings, veggie corn dogs, veggie ground beef, tofu
mayonnaise, soy milk and tofu ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   ``My favorite is the Tofutti ice cream,'' said 22-year-old
Jessica Uribe of West Los Angeles. ``It tastes just like regular
ice cream. It's amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   She tried tofu a year ago and has since become a devoted soy
convert. She's tried it all. Her only real dislike was tofu cheese,
which she said didn't measure up to the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Patterson, a customer representative at Follow Your Heart
Natural Foods Market &AMP; Cafe in Canoga Park, said many of the dishes
chef Dave Spain serves there would fool even the most
discriminating non-vegetarian palate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tofu is very versatile,'' she said. ``By itself, it's bland.
But it takes the flavor of how you prepare it ... We make a very
delicious non-dairy chocolate mousse. You would never know it's
made with soy. It's incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Dietitian Virginia Messina, a co-author of ``The Simple Soybean
and Your Health'' (Avery Publishing Group; $12.95), said texturized
vegetable protein _ aka veggie ground beef _ is a great meat
substitute in spaghetti, sloppy joes, lasagna and tacos. The
substance has the texture of ground beef and readily absorbs any
seasonings.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't even realize it's not ground beef,''
said Messina, whose husband, Mark, wrote the first major scientific
report on soy's potential role in cancer prevention. ``It simply
does not get any easier to introduce soy foods into your diet.''
</P>
<P>
   Another tasty recipe: Put some soft, silken tofu or powdered soy
concentrate in a blender with some frozen fruit. Add a little
sweetener ifit isn't sweet enough. ``That's a very nice
introduction to tofu _ a very cool, creamy kind of dish,'' Messina
said.
</P>
<P>
   Or, for the quickest way to reach the heart disease-fighting
level of soy protein, make a fruit smoothie with soy powder, a
concentrated form of soy protein that can be slipped easily into
many drinks. A standard dose of the powder equals 15 grams of soy
protein, more than half of the needed 25 grams.
</P>
<P>
   Some soy yardsticks: A serving of soy milk has 3 to 4 grams of
soy protein. A 3-ounce serving of regular tofu has roughly a dozen
grams of soy protein. And a cup of cooked soybeans is roughly 30
grams.
</P>
<P>
   For those who remain unconvinced, Messina shares her secret
weapon: ``Take soft tofu and puree it in a food processor and add
melted chocolate chips. Pour that into a pie crust and stick it in
the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice filling for a chocolate cream pie _ not the most
healthy way to introduce soy foods into your diet,'' she continued,
``but if you want to convince your family that this is food that is
edible ... this is a good way to start.''

ROBERT KRAMER, 60, MOVIE DIRECTOR WHOSE FILMS CHRONICLED THE
ANTI-WAR '60S  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN RIDING    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Robert Kramer, an American movie director whose
portrayals of militants caught up in the antiwar movement of the
late 1960s and early 1970s earned him a prominent place in modern
political cinema, died on Wednesday in a hospital in Rouen, France,
at the age of 60. Friends gave the cause of death as meningitis.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kramer was best known in the United States for his
radical early movies, notably ``The Edge,'' ``Ice'' and
``Milestones,'' he remained a prolific filmmaker after he moved to
Paris in 1980. ``Doc's Kingdom'' and ``Route 1/U.S.A.'' were among
his later films that were also released in the United States. At
the time of his death, he had just completed a new movie, ``Cities
of the Plains.''
</P>
<P>
   Kramer's films never reached a wide audience, but they had a
loyal following in the world of avant-garde and experimental cinema
and were frequently featured at film festivals around the world.
``A Toute Allure'' was one of three official French selections for
the 1982 Cannes International Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   After his 1980 film ``Guns'' was shown at the New York Film
Festival, Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times that ``its
director is one of the most exciting filmmakers we have and it's
incredible that he can find financing only in France.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul McIsaac, an American actor who appeared in several of
Kramer's films, said an implosion of the radical movement in the
United States also prompted the director to move to France. ``The
French film world attracted him because he could continue to be
political,'' McIsaac said in a telephone interview from New York.
</P>
<P>
   But while his films remained broadly political (for instance,
``Doc's Kingdom,'' made in 1987, is about a burned-out former
radical living in Portugal), they were no less distinguished by his
strongly personal directing style. For him, reality and fiction,
like art and life, constantly blurred so that, as he once said,
``one day or other all these films that I'm making will make up a
single long film, a `story' that is always developing.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in New York on June 22, 1939, Kramer studied philosophy and
Western European history at Swarthmore College and Stanford
University, where he emerged as a committed leftist. After
organizing a community project in an African-American area in
Newark in 1965, he helped found the Newsreel movement, which
between 1967 and 1971 made some 60 documentaries and short films
about radical political subjects and the antiwar movement.
</P>
<P>
   It was during this period that Kramer also made ``The Edge'' and
``Ice,'' which won him the attention of American film experts.
``Ice,'' for example, focused on ``imminent urban guerrilla warfare
in the United States'' against an American regime intervening
repressively in Mexico. ``It is an awfully proud and humorless film
and although I can't say that I really like it, I do admire it,''
Canby wrote at the time, ``and I'd recommend it to anyone
interested in politics or movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing ``Milestones'' in 1975, Canby again referred to
Kramer's seriousness. ``Mr. Kramer's concerns are so particular,
and his manner usually so humorless, that one doesn't easily
recognize his talent as one of the most original and gifted young
filmmakers,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In his review of ``Guns,'' Canby developed this idea. ``Mr.
Kramer seems incapable of shooting a scene, framing a shot or
catching a line of dialogue that isn't loaded with information one
usually finds only in the best, the most spare poetry,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer is survived by his wife, Erika, and their daughter, Keja,
as well as by Rain Kramer, his daughter from an earlier marriage.

IT'S BOXING'S TIME TO PROVE IT'S A PUNCH ABOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Don King was maybe two minutes into his riff,
seemingly without taking a breath as words and then hundreds of
words poured from his mouth, the promoter telling one and all that
he, more than anyone, wants boxing cleaned up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I steadfastly and manifestly proclaim that the evil should be
removed from this great sport,'' the promoter boomed. ``Let the
evil wrongdoers be exposed to the shining light of day, as the
Bible says they should, let the prosecutors come in and do their
manifest duty. This is America! No one in America is above the law,
the president is not above the law, so let the wrongdoers be thrown
out as they most deservedly should be thrown out, and let the
guilty ones be punished.''
</P>
<P>
   So boxing has come to this.
</P>
<P>
   Don King calling for reform, to which Lennox Lewis says,
``Anything Don King is involved in, you've got to be suspicious.''
</P>
<P>
   A circus.
</P>
<P>
   Only one ring, though.
</P>
<P>
   Akin to Wrasslin'.
</P>
<P>
   Quietly, much more quietly a while later, King disclosed that a
goodly chunk of tickets for Saturday's Evander Holyfield-Lewis
heavyweight title fight at UNLV's Thomas &AMP; Mack Center had come
back on the market (from Las Vegas casinos that had reserved them
for the high-rollers who didn't come). Even more, the pay-per-view
folk are not guessing, as they usually do, how many millions will
watch the fight on TV; the educated guess is that some 500,000 or
so fewer will tune in than tuned in for their controversial first
fight in March at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   King, still with a straight face, has dubbed the fight:
``Unfinished Business; The Search for the Truth.'' Truth, of
course, seldom has been able to find a sparring partner in the
boxing ring.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of the two _ boxing's ugly unshaven face finally
repelling those who buy the tickets _ has brought an aura to the
fight seldom seen; that the clean-up-the-sport crowd must finally
be heeded. On the surface, at least.
</P>
<P>
   First off, it has been trumpeted that the three judges for the
bout are both competent and honest, and definitely have not been
bought off. The judges are Jerry Roth, who has judged about 100
title fights in 17 years, Chuck Giampa who has scored about 75
championship bouts in eight years, and Bill Graham, who has judged
about 50 title fights in six years. It is heralded that all three
are from Nevada, now interestingly regarded as the most honest spot
in America to hold a boxing match.
</P>
<P>
   But in Las Vegas, where illusion is all, the truest test is
whether anyone comes to see the show. The end of the first
Lewis-Holyfield fight was controversial enough, when judge Eugenia
Williams (picked by King crony and International Boxing Federation
head Bob Lee) scored the bout as few with open eyes saw it, for
Holyfield, amid suspicions she was financially tied to King. And
King, no prisoner of political correctness, now puts it, ``Even Ray
Charles could see'' that something was amiss in the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Even more, before the controversial draw when most had given the
fight to Lewis, the fight was more a cautious half-yawn than a true
heavyweigt battle.
</P>
<P>
   So, with interest in the fight tepid, the prebout consensus is
that boxing is at a crossroads. But the consensus, as with any
consensus, just may be wrong. That's because some 6,000 English
have come over to see Lewis, who was born in England, finally earn
a victory in the United States, where the English so seldom do well
(Lewis is a 2-1 favorite). His supporters will be loud and rowdy.
</P>
<P>
   And the fight just may be good. Holyfield (36-3-1), for one, has
been perfect in his rematches, going 5-0 in his second chances,
most notably against Michael Moorer and Riddick Bowe, who both had
beaten Holyfield the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get two fighters with the same skill, the one with the
most will is going to win,'' said Don Turner, Holyfield's trainer.
``In other words, the one who wants it the most. And Evander has
won the rematches because he wants to prove he's better than they
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield, for his part, said he has studied the tape of the
first bout with Lewis and saw ``that I made too many mistakes. If I
just minimize the mistakes, I can win.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has been speaking to respected referee Mitch Halpern
through the media. (Head-butting is a longtime Holyfield ploy,
Lewis said, ``and he uses his head as if it were a battering
ram.'') Lewis's trainer, Emanuel Steward, said that his boxer is so
fit and strong now that ``I don't know of any heavyweight in the
world who can go over six rounds with him (Saturday night).''
</P>
<P>
   Steward seems to be trying to get his message through to his own
boxer, because Lewis so often has been cautious in his bouts.
Steward's message is that his fighter, with a huge weight
advantage, is too strong for his smaller foe and can put him away
early. If he dares to.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Holyfield) is the one who was supposed to come in and knock
me out,'' said Lewis of Holyfield's prediction that he was going to
knock out Lewis by the third round in the first fight. ``I've been
in there with the man and I know what I can do. I know what I
should have done and could have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield certainly has the stronger will of the two, and it is
still unknown if Lewis can dare to be great. All of which should
lead to a most interesting fight, and Don King just might be saying
late Saturday that he ``steadfastly and manifestly'' always knew in
his bones that boxing is ready for the next millennium if only
there can be more bouts like this.

CAPITAL CROSSOVER: AMERICA INVESTS HEAVILY IN CANADA (AND VICE
VERSA) 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JAMES BROOKE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Twenty years ago, when an outside company tried to buy
MacMillan Bloedel, British Columbia's largest timber company, the
provincial premier reacted angrily, saying: ``B.C. is not for
sale.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Nov. 1, MacMillan, an 80-year-old Canadian company,
disappeared into the corporate maw of Weyerhaeuser in a deal worth
$2.4 billion. Approval of the takeover came this summer from
provincial Forestry Minister David Zirnhelt, who said, ``Icons
don't make jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking advantage of a neighboring economy newly open to foreign
investment and a Canadian dollar trading near historic lows,
Americans are vacuuming up Canadian companies at a record pace. In
the first nine months of this year, American companies bought 181
companies for $24 billion, double the amount spent during the
corresponding period last year, according to a survey by KPMG
Corporate Finance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canada has a `for sale' sign on the lawn, courtesy of a very
cheap exchange rate,'' said David Rosenberg, a senior economist at
Nesbitt Burns, a major securities firm in Toronto. Although the
Canadian dollar has strengthened slightly this year to 68 U.S.
cents, Canadian companies still seem cheap to American executives
who remember the days in the 1960s when North America's two dollars
were equal in value.
</P>
<P>
   Today, American investors are also plunging into Canadian
stocks. In the first seven months of this year, Americans increased
their Canadian stock holdings by $6.5 billion, a sevenfold increase
over the corresponding period two years ago. More American
investment is on the way, according to 23 American portfolio
managers surveyed in October about the Canadian markets by
Broadgate Consultants, a capital markets communications firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the investors surveyed said they would increase or
maintain their Canadian positions over the next 12 months,'' John
Silver, a Broadgate managing director, said from New York. ``What
caught my eye was the incredible amount of good will that American
portfolio managers had toward Canadian companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, while Americans are investing heavily in Canadian stocks
and companies, Canadians are funneling their money across the
border in volumes evocative of capital flight from Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   As of August, Canadians had, for the first time on record, more
money invested in foreign stock markets than in Canadian markets,
according to data compiled by Statistics Canada, a government
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Investing largely in American shares, Canadians now own at least
$57 billion of foreign stocks _ almost $2,000 for each Canadian
citizen. This drain has taken place despite tax credits for owning
local stocks and a government-mandated 20 percent cap on foreign
investments for registered retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   And while Canada's economy is only 7 percent the size of its
southern neighbor, Canada has become the fourth-largest direct
foreign investor in the United States. Last year, Canada, with 30
million inhabitants, had $87 billion invested in real assets in the
United States. The United States, with nine times Canada's
population, had $99.3 billion invested directly in Canada. During
much of the 1990s, Canadian investment abroad increased at twice
the rate as foreign investment here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair to call it capital flight,'' Rosenberg said. ``The
irony is that while Canadians have become net sellers of
Canadian-based mutual funds, foreigners have been dramatically
lifting their investments in Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   And now, with oil and gasoline prices rising sharply this year
and an Asian recovery fueling demand for minerals and wood
products, those bets are starting to pay off as prospects improve
for Canada's economy, which is heavily dependent on natural
resources. Compared with last year, when the Toronto Stock Exchange
300, the market's main index, dropped 3 percent, it has
outperformed the equivalent in the United States, the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500, so far this year, rising 16.04 percent, compared with
13.57 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is looking for undiscovered stocks,'' Silver said of
American interest in Canadian companies.
</P>
<P>
   Yet after watching the Canadian dollar shrink by a third in
value, Canadians are leery of investing in their own country.
</P>
<P>
   Canadians tend to dwell on their economic negatives, especially
the $50 billion a year in taxes that goes every year to service
federal and provincial debts. Largely because of these interest
payments, Canada's tax revenue equals 37 percent of its gross
domestic product, compared with 32 percent for federal, state and
local taxes in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Partly because of this higher tax burden, Canada's unemployment
rate is 7.2 percent, well above the 4.1 percent rate in the United
States. And Canada, in contrast with the United States, has not
registered growth in real personal income during the 1990s. As the
``brain drain'' becomes a national conversation topic, half of
1,850 senior Canadian executives agreed in a recent survey with the
statement: ``Talented people are leaving the country due to high
income taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   But, after budget cutting, the federal government here recorded
a $2 billion surplus last year, which is expected to rise to nearly
$4 billion this year. After lagging behind the United States during
much of the 1990s, Canada is expected to equal the forecast U.S.
growth rate of 4 percent this year. With budget surpluses expected
to grow in coming years, business people are lobbying heavily to
use them to cut taxes and to pay down the $392 billion national
debt.
</P>
<P>
   Although Canada increased its total take in personal and
corporate income taxes by 39 percent over the last five years,
Finance Minister Paul Martin vowed in a policy speech earlier this
month to cut taxes in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, to American investors, a growing economy, an
undervalued market, and a currency that appears to have stabilized
are signals to buy.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T and Ameritech this year bought up to the 20 percent limit
on foreign ownership of Canadian telecommunications companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is more and more U.S. investment,'' said Bruce
McWilliam, a lawyer here specializing in foreign investment in such
companies. Referring to the 20 percent limits on foreign investment
in banking, telecommunications and transport, he said, ``They
always want to try to come up to the limits of what is allowed
under foreign investment rules.''

</P>
<P>
   In the finance sector, the CIT Group, a Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank
unit based in Livingston, N.J., agreed in late October to pay $2.7
billion for the Newcourt Credit Group, a growing commercial finance
company based in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   In western Canada's oil patch, two Houston companies are making
big purchases. Burlington Resources is paying $1.9 billion for Poco
Petroleums of Calgary, and Apache is paying $531 million for most
of Shell Canada Ltd.'s oil producing properties. Shell is a unit of
Royal Dutch/Shell.
</P>
<P>
   As some see it, in the oil and gas business _ and many other
industries as well _ the border between the United States and
Canada is being erased.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 49th parallel is gone _ just look at the deals,'' said
Rick Roberge, a petroleum analyst with PricewaterhouseCoopers.
Roberge, an Albertan who now works in mergers and acquisitions in
Houston, also noted that Canadian energy companies had made
purchases of American companies.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling the activity, he said, was a 50 percent jump in natural
gas prices since spring and the expected opening next year of a gas
pipeline from western Canada to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in Canada has extended to the aviation industry. AMR,
the parent of American Airlines, and UAL, parent of United
Airlines, marshaled rival bids of about half a billion dollars each
in an effort help Canadian allies wrest control of Canada's two
major airlines. United and its partner, Air Canada, emerged as the
winners this month after an American-backed bid was disbanded.
</P>
<P>
   All these American investments in Canada, like those Canadians
are making in the United States, reflect North America's rapid
economic integration.
</P>
<P>
   In the biggest deal on the part of Canadians in the United
States, Canadian National Railway paid $2.4 billion this summer for
Illinois Central. Building on an explosion in north-south trade
after a free trade pact was signed a decade ago, the expanded
railroad will carry freight from Canada to Chicago and on to New
Orleans. In another major deal, Toronto's Nortel Networks, a unit
of Northern Telecom and Canada's largest supplier of telephone
equipment, agreed in mid-October to pay $2.1 billion for Clarify, a
San Jose, Calif., e-commerce software company.
</P>
<P>
   And in a deal that makes Quebecor Printing the world's largest
commercial printer, the Montreal-based company paid $1.4 billion
for a major American rival, World Color Press, of Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this evidence of a two-way street, many people here
focus on what they call the threatened loss of their sports icons _
professional hockey, basketball and baseball teams coveted by
wealthy American investors. Bill Laurie, a St. Louis billionaire,
for example, has been negotiating to buy the Vancouver Grizzlies
basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   Some commentators fear that Canadian National Hockey League
teams are next.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ottawa Senators will be first,'' Jeffrey Simpson, a Globe
and Mail columnist, predicted recently. ``Within a year or two, or
perhaps even sooner, the Calgary Flames, Edmonton Oilers and
Vancouver Canucks will follow, leaving Canada with only the Toronto
Maple Leafs and Montreal Canadiens.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the percentage of Canada's economy controlled by
foreign companies is actually lower today than during the
nationalist days of the 1970s, Canadian newspapers carry laments
about some of the high-profile purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great sucking sound from the south is creating a storm of
troubles,'' Eric Reguly, a columnist, warned in a recent Globe and
Mail article titled ``The devouring of Corporate Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend is depressingly familiar,'' he wrote. ``A Canadian
company grows, often with the tender loving care of the provincial
and federal governments, gets big enough to attract attention on
the international stage and _ zap! _ vanishes like a bug into a
frog's mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Fearing that Canada is losing corporate headquarters, he noted
that Alcan Aluminum was merging with two rivals and setting up a
head office in New York. The big American buyout was the topic of a
speech delivered in September by Canadian Pacific Ltd. president
David O'Brien before the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, the nation's
largest business association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canadian icons are falling like 10 pins,'' said O'Brien, who
is also chairman of the Business Council on National Issues, a
private policy group. ``The great Canadian fire sale is underway.
Because of the low Canadian dollar, Corporate Canada is easy
pickings for countries with stronger currencies.''
</P>
<P>
   But few people predict a return to the restrictive investment
policies of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't necessarily like each and every one of those
transactions, but this is part and parcel of the integration of
North America,'' said Raymond Chretien, Canada's ambassador to the
United States, in an interview. ``It worries some people,'' the
ambassador, a nephew of Prime Minister Jean Chretien, said, ``but
again if you look at the experience of the last 10 years, it
usually balances out. We Canadians buy a lot in the U.S.''

 &HT;    Developer's plan to relocate cemetery stirs opposition
 &HT;    By D.L. Bennett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANTON, Ga. _ The graves of dozens of former slaves and
generations of their descendents may be dug up and moved to make
way for a Canton shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
   Developers of Riverstone Plaza plan to move the 127-year-old
cemetery of Hickory Log Missionary Baptist Church, one of Cherokee
County's first black churches.
</P>
<P>
   There are no written records of how many were buried at Hickory
Log, but church members and developers say there are 400 to 500.
Burials began about the time of the church's founding in 1872 and
continued for more than 120 years.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives and church members are vehemently against unearthing
the dead to make way for a shopping center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the dead should be left alone,'' said the Rev. Robert
Holmes, pastor of the 480-member church. ``I don't believe in
moving the dead. They shouldn't be disturbed.''
</P>
<P>
   Developer Mike Sasser contends the small cemetery is on property
owned by Bright-Sasser Co. of Atlanta and needs to make way for a
proposed expansion of the shopping center.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Riverstone Plaza is a 600,000-square-foot ``power
center'' anchored by J.C. Penney and Belks department stores off
Interstate 575 in Canton. The 650-acre site will eventually include
Cherokee's first regional shopping mall. The cemetery is on its
western edge.
</P>
<P>
   Sasser said leaving a cemetery inside a massive, regional
shopping complex just doesn't make sense. He plans to apply to the
city soon for a permit to move the graves.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is relocated, then families will have the chance to be
buried together,'' Sasser said. ``There will be perpetual care. I'm
not here to judge what's good and bad, but we'd like to relocate
the cemetery.''
</P>
<P>
   With at least 400 graves, Sasser's proposed relocation might be
the biggest such project ever attempted in Georgia. He expects to
spend at least six months doing the legal work and archeological
research needed to move the bodies, he said. The work of finding
and moving the graves would likely take another year. He has no
estimate yet on how much it would cost.
</P>
<P>
   Hickory Log Church is in the small North Canton community that
has long housed much of the city's black population.
</P>
<P>
   The church was founded just seven years after the end of the
Civil War on a hill overlooking the small city. It and the
graveyard were located on 2 acres of land donated by Phillip Keith,
who was buried there in 1889.
</P>
<P>
   Church members originally met in a log cabin near the cemetery.
They relocated worship services to a brick building on nearby in
1957. Holmes said on an average Sunday about 200 attend service.
</P>
<P>
   Time hasn't been kind to the cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Hidden deep in heavy woods, the cemetery is overgrown and
unkempt. Dozens of knee-high scrub pines grow from sunken graves
with broken and fallen headstones. Unmowed grass grows wildly in
some portions of the cemetery while only dirt covers many of the
more recent burials _ at least one as recent as 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Battered silk flowers decorate several graves. Trash and empty
beer cans are scattered about.
</P>
<P>
   Orange survey tape and tiny orange flags mark the cemetery's
boundaries and some of the grave sites. Newly posted signs warn off
trespassers and ban any new burials.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes said the church has no organized maintenance plan.
Members simply go by when they feel like it, he said. Still, they
don't want it dug up and moved.
</P>
<P>
   Church members contend they own the cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Ferguson, whose wife, mother and father are buried
there, said no deed exists because the land was a gift so long ago.
He said members want a fence erected around the cemetery and no
graves disturbed.
</P>
<P>
   Reinterment would be difficult, Ferguson said, because so many
of the graves are marked only by fieldstones.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would you do with them, dump them all in a big hole?''
Ferguson said. ``We are going to do whatever we have to do to stop
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Sasser concedes that more than half the graves are unmarked. He
said an archeologist found about 400 graves in a survey earlier
this year, but only 150 could be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Sasser wants to rebury the bodies from Hickory Log at Cherokee
Memorial Park at in Canton, where the church has already bought 100
plots for future burials.
</P>
<P>
   Those who can be identified will be given proper markers. The
remainder will be given a group headstone explaining the history of
the area they came from, Sasser said.
</P>
<P>
   Family members say whatever Sasser could do wouldn't be enough
to convince them to support relocation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bothers me that they would do this,'' said Gable Holmes, a
church member whose mother, father, brother and other relatives are
buried at Hickory Log. ``They will never be able to dig all of them
up. They can't find half of the graves now. I'd rather them put a
fence around it.''
</P>
<P>
   The dead regularly stand in the way of progress in metro
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Auto dealer C.V. Nalley III spent five years trying to arrange
removal and reburial of 52 graves for a dealership near Town Center
mall.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the cemetery looked like a barren outcropping after
grading crews cut away all the land surrounding the Edwards-Attaway
cemetery for parking. Eventually, lawsuits were settled and the
graves moved.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, developers of Avondale Mall agreed to build a
granite mausoleum around the gravesites of some of DeKalb's
earliest settlers. In north DeKalb County near I-285, five small
family graveyards are surrounded by Northlake Mall.

3 ENCOUNTERS INSPIRE THOUGHTS OF BINDING TIES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the surface, the three events were completely different _ and
even more so the three individuals at the center of them. A small
lunch, a private interview, a public lecture.
</P>
<P>
   An Italian Roman Catholic cardinal steeped in years of Vatican
diplomacy; a Jordanian prince claiming direct descent, over 42
generations, from the prophet Muhammad; a Canadian philosopher
known for his explorations of liberalism, ethics and the nature of
modernity.
</P>
<P>
   But jammed up one after another a few days back, the three
encounters left the sense that beyond all the differences, some
common thread wove them into a larger pattern.
</P>
<P>
   The lunch was with Cardinal Achille Silvestrini. For many years
he was papal under secretary of state, the Vatican's equivalent of
foreign minister. Now he heads the Vatican's office for Eastern
churches _ that is, for the churches originating in the Middle East
and Eastern Europe that recognize the pope's authority but follow
ancient, non-Western rites and practices.
</P>
<P>
   Silvestrini has just edited a collection of excerpts from talks
that John Paul II has given in the course of 85 journeys around the
world. So strictly speaking, it was a publisher's lunch, a small
gathering of journalists and churchmen to greet ``A Pilgrim Pope''
(K.S. Giniger/Andrews McMeel Universal).
</P>
<P>
   But Silvestrini was not in the United States to publicize a
book. He was here to meet with the bishops from the Western
Hemisphere who oversee non-Latin-rite Catholic churches founded by
immigrants from Ukraine, Hungary, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   One lunchtime topic, therefore, became the strained relations
between the Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Christianity,
strains that leave many of these Eastern-rite Catholics caught in
the middle. Are they part of the solution, a bridge between divided
parts of Christianity? Or are they part of the problem, a papal
bridgehead that threatens Eastern Orthodoxy?
</P>
<P>
   The other topic was the plight of Arab Christians, whose
presence in the Middle East has fallen victim to the region's
religious rivalries and economic disruption.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the conversation was, of course, the cardinal
himself, always a diplomat in the best sense. His evenhanded
assessments of the fears, fault lines and failures of different
religious groups radiated sympathy and not blame. One could
understand why a few years ago he was often listed among possible
successors to John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   By now, his age, 76, might tell against him as a papal
candidate. But one could imagine him still a ``great elector,'' a
man so respected by other cardinals that his support for a
candidate would be extremely persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   From his eminence to his royal highness was a jolt. Prince El
Hassan bin Talal of Jordan, the younger brother of the late King
Hussein, is a compact, thickset man who bristles with energy,
physical and intellectual. He is a veteran of international
commissions and a serious patron of interfaith dialogue, but it is
not surprising to learn he is also a black belt in martial arts.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he had come from a meeting at the Council on Foreign
Relations to the offices of the World Conference on Religion and
Peace near the United Nations. In two weeks, he will preside as
chairman of the conference's Seventh World Assembly, which will
bring more than 600 senior religious leaders together in Amman,
Jordan, to discuss ways of resolving violent conflicts and building
peaceful institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Tossed a standard query about religion and violence, Hassan was
off and running. He quoted Pascal and Kierkegaard, Yehudi Menuhin,
Vaclav Havel and the archbishop of Canterbury. He mentioned
personal encounters in Bosnia, Prague, Ulster, Albania, Geneva, at
the Wiesenthal Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles. No words
recurred more than ``universal,'' ``pluralism,'' ``code of
ethics.'' World leaders and institutions had to pursue a
``spiritual agenda'' alongside the political and economic ones;
humankind needed a universal morality developed on the basis of a
genuine pluralism.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Taylor was yet another contrast. On Monday evening, this
Canadian scholar of Hegel and exacting analyst of modern identity
in the magisterial work ``Sources of the Self'' (Harvard University
Press, 1989), was lecturing on ``Democracy and Exclusion'' to a
crowded auditorium at the New School for Social Research.
</P>
<P>
   Where Hassan had spilled his ideas out in a cascade, Taylor
unwrapped his carefully, step by step. Why, he asked, had the last
two centuries of expanding democracy also been an era of
unprecedented ethnic cleansing?
</P>
<P>
   He cautioned against the complacent assumption that such conduct
was merely atavistic ``tribalism,'' destined to disappear with the
progress of modernity. Exclusion, in one form or another, is also
the child of popular sovereignty, he said: democracy, no less than
authoritarian regimes, poses the question, Who is this ``we'' of
``we the people,'' and modern conditions make it increasingly
unlikely that minorities will even allow themselves to be
assimilated into the ``we'' of the majority. The problem, he said,
is not going away but has somehow to be accommodated.
</P>
<P>
   Were these three events anything more than fascinating but
unconnected moments in an overheated New York schedule?
</P>
<P>
   Was it fanciful to think that they had suddenly lit up a window
into the global web of people and projects, thinking, talking,
organizing, that keep a deeply divided humanity from tearing itself
apart, that might even, someday, stitch by stitch, bind it
together?

<P>
   Many Americans are going to have a hard time swallowing the 25
grams of soy protein required to fight heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   To meet the level the U.S. Food and Drug Administration says is
required to scrub bad cholesterol out of arteries, it would take
four servings of soy products a day _ one serving at breakfast,
another at lunch, then dinner, and a snack. That's a lot of
processed bean product for a nation in love with meat and potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   But there is hope.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate America responded to the explosion of scientific
interest in the health benefits of soy with a plethora of products
_ faux chicken wings, veggie corn dogs, veggie ground beef, tofu
mayonnaise, soy milk and tofu ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   ``My favorite is the Tofutti ice cream,'' said 22-year-old
Jessica Uribe of West Los Angeles. ``It tastes just like regular
ice cream. It's amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   She tried tofu a year ago and has since become a devoted soy
convert. She's tried it all. Her only real dislike was tofu cheese,
which she said didn't measure up to the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Patterson, a customer representative at Follow Your Heart
Natural Foods Market &AMP; Cafe in Canoga Park, said many of the dishes
chef Dave Spain serves there would fool even the most
discriminating non-vegetarian palate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tofu is very versatile,'' she said. ``By itself, it's bland.
But it takes the flavor of how you prepare it ... We make a very
delicious non-dairy chocolate mousse. You would never know it's
made with soy. It's incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Dietitian Virginia Messina, a co-author of ``The Simple Soybean
and Your Health'' (Avery Publishing Group; $12.95), said texturized
vegetable protein _ aka veggie ground beef _ is a great meat
substitute in spaghetti, sloppy joes, lasagna and tacos. The
substance has the texture of ground beef and readily absorbs any
seasonings.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't even realize it's not ground beef,''
said Messina, whose husband, Mark, wrote the first major scientific
report on soy's potential role in cancer prevention. ``It simply
does not get any easier to introduce soy foods into your diet.''
</P>
<P>
   Another tasty recipe: Put some soft, silken tofu or powdered soy
concentrate in a blender with some frozen fruit. Add a little
sweetener if it isn't sweet enough. ``That's a very nice
introduction to tofu _ a very cool, creamy kind of dish,'' Messina
said.
</P>
<P>
   Or, for the quickest way to reach the heart disease-fighting
level of soy protein, make a fruit smoothie with soy powder, a
concentrated form of soy protein that can be slipped easily into
many drinks. A standard dose of the powder equals 15 grams of soy
protein, more than half of the needed 25 grams.
</P>
<P>
   Some soy yardsticks: A serving of soy milk has 3 to 4 grams of
soy protein. A 3-ounce serving of regular tofu has roughly a dozen
grams of soy protein. And a cup of cooked soybeans is roughly 30
grams.
</P>
<P>
   For those who remain unconvinced, Messina shares her secret
weapon: ``Take soft tofu and puree it in a food processor and add
melted chocolate chips. Pour that into a pie crust and stick it in
the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice filling for a chocolate cream pie _ not the most
healthy way to introduce soy foods into your diet,'' she continued,
``but if you want to convince your family that this is food that is
edible ... this is a good way to start.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   She prepared for the Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show two
weeks ago, where a half-billion dollars would change hands over the
next four days, Mike Kelsey Sr., a 40-year veteran of the
boat-building industry, repeated his prayer of gratitude: ``Thank
God there are rich people who love the water and will pay us to do
what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelsey's company, Palmer Johnson of Sturgeon Bay, Wis., builds
very big yachts for very wealthy people _ but not the types of
heirs and oil tycoons he might have catered to 20 years ago.
Instead, he is blessed with a new clientele of self-made Americans
who are as competitive with their toys as they are with their
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   They are people like Lawrence J. Ellison, the chief executive of
the Oracle Corp., whose flotilla includes the 240-foot-long Katana.
Or Craig O. McCaw, the cellular telephone pioneer who owns the
193-foot Calixe and is scheduled to take delivery of a
300-plus-foot yacht by the end of the year. (People in the industry
disagree over just how long it will be.) But that might still put
him behind Leslie H. Wexner, founder of the Limited. His yacht, the
Limitless, delivered in 1997, is the largest American-owned
pleasure vessel afloat, at 315 feet, according to Boat
International USA magazine.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the Forbes family's Highlander turned heads when
it was completed in 1986 at a mere 150 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the latest boats depends not only on size but also
on furnishings, engines, electronics and special features. Kelsey
said his company had just built a 195-foot boat for $35 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the last five years, the number of superyachts _ vaguely
defined as 80 feet or longer _ has doubled worldwide, to more than
5,000 from about 2,700, Kelsey said. And in an industry once
dominated by European craftsmen and Middle Eastern buyers, the
number of Americans building and buying these boats has grown.
</P>
<P>
   Kay Pierson, producer of the boat show and a former president of
the Superyacht Society, based in Fort Lauderdale, estimates that
American shipbuilders now supply more than 45 percent of
superyachts, up from less than 10 percent a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, most buyers were from other countries, said Diane M.
Byrne, editor of Power and Motoryacht magazine, but now ``the
majority of people buying superyachts are Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's shoppers _ they are almost always men _ are eager.
``Today there is a thought process of, `I worked hard, I made the
money and I'm going to enjoy it,''' Pierson said.
</P>
<P>
   But the buyers do want to keep close watch on how their money is
being spent. While many still turn to the Europeans for their
ships, one person in the clothing industry chose an American firm,
Broward Marine in Fort Lauderdale, so he could keep his nose in the
blueprints.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a moment's notice we could have hands-on control of the
construction process,'' the owner said in a telephone interview
from Maui, his current port of call. ``That actually was 50 percent
of the fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The owner asked to be identified only by the name of his $8
million ship, the Varsity Jacket, in keeping with the traditional
coyness of this industry and its customers.
</P>
<P>
   Yachting publications, like Boat International USA, refer to
owners in genteel, indirect ways: ``Meduse is owned by the former
partner of the world's richest man'' or ``Princess Marla's new
owners are the founders of the Home Shopping Network.''
</P>
<P>
   Meduse has its own Web site that boasts about the boat's
200-foot length, its recording studio and its helicopter that can
seat eight (www.meduse.com). The Microsoft Internet Explorer
advertisement at the bottom of the boat's home page hints at the
common industry knowledge that the owner is Paul G. Allen,
co-founder of Microsoft. (For that matter, www.mylimitless.com
carries neither clothing advertisements nor a mention of Wexner,
but it does include figures like 22,000, the boat's horsepower.)
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, the propriety of the yachting world is giving
way. ``Now, it's sort of a contest,'' said Jill Bobrow, editor of
Boat International USA. ``How much marble can they dazzle with?''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, she said, ``they have to keep things high
tech.'' The latest boats are adorned with so many Jet Skis,
helicopters and submersible vehicles that they are called the sport
utility vehicles of yachts.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, ``The New New Thing'' (W.W. Norton, 2000), about
James H. Clark, the Netscape Communications chairman, Michael Lewis
built his story around Hyperion, Clark's high-technology sloop that
is so wired that it could be sailed remotely.
</P>
<P>
   Clark openly sought to have the world's tallest yacht mast, with
the caveat that it fit under the Golden Gate Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Barb Tierney, vice president of the Florida Yacht Brokers
Association, said half of the world's superyachts are bought and
sold in Fort Lauderdale, making it a bustling center for the trade.
There are companies that find and hire crews, repair and renovate
boats and supply all the extras, like lapis lazuli bathtubs. Ms.
Tierney has arranged the sale of boats that range in price from
$500,000 to $42 million.
</P>
<P>
   Because the new yachts are too big for some marinas, having a
tender _ a helicopter or a smaller boat _ on board can be essential
for reaching shore. Zodiac of North America Inc., which makes most
of the rigid inflatable boats used by the United States military,
was initially reluctant to latch on to the superyacht business.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I said, `How many of these boats can there be?'''
said J.J. Marie, Zodiac's president. But superyacht tenders costing
$25,000 to $250,000 apiece _ some come with inflatable toilets _
now make up 30 percent of the company's sales volume.
</P>
<P>
   Financing the yachts has become easier. At least one bank offers
loans with annual payments _ a plan that appeals to executives who
receive yearly bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   But the sales price is far from the entire cost of owning a
yacht. The upkeep on a $10 million yacht runs about $1 million a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The superyachts are cutting such a wide, deep swath that they
are beginning to alter the seascape. Some popular marinas, like the
site of next year's America's Cup Race in Auckland, New Zealand,
are accommodating them by dredging and installing new equipment, to
become what are known in the trade as superports.

 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Anthony Ruiz was celebrating his 8th birthday at the
Cineplex Beverly Center, joining the hundreds of children and
parents taking in ``Pokemon: The First Movie'' on four screens at
the center, one of 3,000 theaters that presented the animated film
on Wednesday and haven't had a quiet moment since.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-minute feature earned $10.l million on its opening day, a
school day, the largest Wednesday opening of any animated film
ever, and the biggest Wednesday opening for any film in Warner
Bros. history. On Thursday, it made another $9 million. By the end
of the weekend, its earnings are expected to exceed $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby toyshops sported prominent Pokemon displays; kids
clutched their precious Pokemon figurines, some wore Pokemon
T-shirts. No doubt, some had Pokemon videogames in their knapsacks.
Ruiz struggled to explain what all the fuss was about. ``It has
these characters,'' he said. ``They come from a different world.
People collect them and they have these different battles.''
Finally, he gave up. ``It's just cool,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pokemon craze can seem impenetrable to those _ adults, for
instance _ who are not conversant with its intricate fantasy world.
Even those who are promoting the phenomenon, and reaping the
astonishing rewards, are a little stunned by how deftly it has
attached itself to the hearts of millions of American children,
especially boys between the ages of 5 and 12.
</P>
<P>
   But while luck certainly played a role, Pokemon is also the
result of a very calculated series of creative and marketing
decisions aimed at learning the lessons of previous toy crazes like
Beanie Babies, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Power Rangers, and
using those lessons to build something that will not only resonate
with children but survive longer than the 18 months to three years
that these crazes normally last.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put a considerable amount of attention into that,'' said
Gail Tilden, vice president for product-acquisition development at
Nintendo and the queen of all things Pokemon, and responsible for
shepherding the Pokemon brand through its many American
manifestations.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tilden is responsible for making sure that all the Pokemon
products adhere to the basic story line behind the series, that
none of the products are marketed to preschoolers or toddlers
(because if babies play with it, older children will want nothing
to do with it), and that Pokemon characters are attached to
compatible toys (a water-related Pokemon on a water toy, for
instance). She also monitors the rolling out of new Pokemon
characters, which is done in a way intended to stimulate the
collecting side of the craze _ not so few characters that they are
too easily collected, nor so many that collecting them all, the
goal of all true Pokemoners, seems unrealizable. ``We are trying to
mirror the property very well, not just put the Pokemon theme on
anything,'' Ms. Tilden said.
</P>
<P>
   For those unacquainted with Pokemon, it is a series of products
that revolve around a fantasy world created by Japanese animators
and game creators in which there are two kinds of creatures, humans
and Pokemon. The latter are more than 150 animal-like creatures
(three new ones are introduced in the new film, bringing the total
to 154), each with its own personality and powers and the ability
to transform into yet other creatures. The hero of the story, Ash,
yearns to be a master Pokemon trainer, and to do so he vows to
capture all 150-plus Pokemons (''Gotta Catch `Em All'' is the
Pokemon tag line and the anthem of all Pokemon enthusiasts).
</P>
<P>
   Children can imitate Ash and try to capture Pokemon, as well,
either in the videogame or by buying their plastic figures or
trading cards. And there are dozens of related consumer items from
clothes to toothbrushes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very difficult for any franchise to come into prominence
in the kid world, to be forefront in their minds,'' said Gene Del
Vecchio, the author of ``Creating Ever Cool: A Marketer's Guide to
the Kid's Heart'' and the head of CoolWorks, a consulting company
that helps companies invent and build brands for children. ``There
are thousands and thousands of competitors for that honored slot.
Even more difficult is trying to keep within a kid consciousness
for more than the 18 months or three years these things normally
last. How do you create a mechanism whereby you can reinvent
yourself?''
</P>
<P>
   Many children's marketing experts said that the shrewd design of
the Pokemon empire _ its perfectly pitched emotional story line,
the way it stimulates social interaction, the sense of power and
belonging it gives children _ give it a good chance to avoid
craze-burnout. Others were not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really something amazing that has occurred,'' said
Steveanne Auerbach, who goes by the name Dr. Toy and reviews toys
and children's products from her Internet site, www.drtoy.com.
``But I expect Pokemon will have the normal life span of these
sorts of things. It's here until the next wave comes along.''
</P>
<P>
   Pokemon _ which began life in the United States in September
1998 as a Nintendo videogame and quickly expanded into bean-bag
toys, action figures, comic books, T-shirts and a cartoon show _
looked as if it had reached fever pitch last spring with the
release of Pokemon collectible cards that became the currency of
choice on thousands of American playgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out that was just a warm-up.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of a new fall season of Pokemon cartoons on the
WB Network, which runs the program 11 times a week; the
staggeringly successful release of the Pokemon movie, and a
concurrent marketing tie-in at 8,000 Burger King restaurants has
succeeded in catapulting the Japanese-born phenomenon to new
heights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got home from taking five kids to the Pokemon movie and
to Burger King,'' said Lynn Rosenblum, president of Toy Power
Consulting. ``When you look at it from a marketing and a branding
perspective, it's brilliant. It covers television, it covers video,
it covers things on your computer, there's the cards, there's the
toys, there are art contests. It's really one of the products that
has done the best job of covering all those bases.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When Pokemon was initially rolled out in Japan, beginning with
the introduction of the videogame in 1996, it was a much slower
process. The first Pokemon movie did not open in Japan until the
summer of 1998, two years after the videogame debuted and the
second film (yes, there is already a second, and it is to open in
the United States next summer) opened in Japan just three months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time we were ready to import Pokemon into the United
States, all of these products were available to us,'' Ms. Tilden
said. Marketers thus could capitalize more quickly on hot moments
in the craze.
</P>
<P>
   What often happens, in cases of toy lines like Ninja Turtles,
for instance, is that by the time it becomes clear that the concept
has clicked with children, it is too late to get a movie in
production and into theaters before the craze has begun to cool.
Movies are expensive and take a long time to make, and crazes
sometimes disappear in a blink. With Pokemon, everything was ready
and could be launched whenever marketers deemed the time was right.
</P>
<P>
   So while it may look like luck that Warner Bros. has a Pokemon
movie coming out at just the moment when the fever is at its
height, it is anything but, said Brad Ball, president of domestic
theatrical marketing for Warner Bros. Pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We counseled very closely with our partners, using their
insights on how they saw the new season television episodes
impacting, and we decided that the new episodes would further raise
demand for Pokemon. So ... we decided to release the movie
following the launch of the new television season but still ahead
of the competition in a very competitive environment,'' Ball said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The toughest competition appears to be Disney's ``Toy Story 2,''
which is set for release on Nov. 24, giving Pokemon two weeks in
theaters before Buzz Lightyear returns. ``Then, we can turn the
corner into the new year and have our video division ready for a
spring release,'' Ball said.
</P>
<P>
   After that, probably in the fall of next year, there will be an
entirely new Pokemon series. The current story line, known for the
red-and-blue game cartridges, will be followed by a gold-and-silver
story line, Ms. Tilden said. It, too, will star Ash, but he will
embark on an entirely new adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the former Pokemon creatures will return, others will
have mutated and there will be new ones, too (Ms. Tilden won't say
how many, beyond ``dozens''). In the first story, the Pokemon
seemed to be of indeterminate gender. In the new one, the issue of
gender will be addressed, with some creatures having definite male
and female characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are doing is extending the fantasy,'' Ms. Tilden said.
``It's the same world, but a new story. You will be able to find
out if the one you have is a boy or a girl.''
</P>
<P>
   There are two things that a children's brand needs, Del Vecchio
said: It has to ``touch timeless emotional needs within the
child,'' and it needs a ``mechanism that would allow it to stay
fresh'' and not go the way of the Power Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Barbie did was nail the whole notion of achievement for
little girls,'' Del Vecchio said. ``Pokemon was constructed to
touch several timeless emotional needs. Part of its power comes
from the story line of good vanquishing evil, where the child
becomes part of the story and is empowered to capture his own
monsters, train them and have them fight for him. It also
stimulates the desire to collect them all, but it's competitive in
a way that helps inspire social interaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Pokemon has its own story line (as did Power Rangers and Ninja
Turtles), but it also taps into the notion of collecting that
sustained the Beanie Babies craze. While Power Rangers had the
story line without the collecting and Beanie Babies had the
collecting without the story line, Pokemon has both. All of this
augurs well for the future, Del Vecchio said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The principles they are applying indicate it will last longer
than the average kid franchise,'' he said. ``Whether it will last
30 years will depend on other factors, like how good they are going
to be as marketers and what other franchises may be introduced that
will do an even better job. You know, kids are fickle. They will
get tired of these kinds of properties and dash off to the next
one.''

LUCAS BACK ON FAMILIAR GROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ Pete Carroll let Ray Lucas get away once. It cost
him a versatile fringe player. If he allows the same thing to
happen Monday, it will cost him something even more dear: a
division game.
</P>
<P>
   When Lucas arrives at Foxboro Stadium as the starting
quarterback for the New York Jets for this prime-time meeting with
the Patriots, he won't need directions.
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, was his address for a year _ the Patriots'
Super Bowl season of 1996, when he was Bill Parcells's pet project.
A prolific quarterback at Rutgers, Lucas spent 15 weeks on the New
England practice squad, then was activated for the final two games
and the playoffs. Parcells made no secret that he wanted him around
_ someplace. Because of his superior athleticism, the
6-foot-3-inch, 214-pound Lucas did a little of this and a little of
that. Scout team quarterback. Spare wide receiver. Special teams
commando. And in a pinch, he could have been utilized at defensive
back. Parcells tried him at just about everything, it seemed,
except redecorating the coach's office.
</P>
<P>
   And he probably wasn't given that job only because Parcells
vacated it almost as soon as the Super Bowl loss to the Green Bay
Packers was history, heading to the New York Jets with the de facto
title of Master of All He Surveys.
</P>
<P>
   His replacement, Carroll, wasn't as enamored of Lucas, who wound
up rejoining Parcells after being cut in training camp in 1997.
Carroll had nothing personal against Lucas, even if he had been a
Parcells favorite, and the new coach eventually heard enough of his
sainted predecessor's name to wake up screaming it in horror in the
middle of the night. No, this was simply an honest miscalculation,
Carroll recalled Friday with regretful hindsight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made an error, a big mistake,'' said Carroll, who
essentially limited Lucas to wide receiver and special teams work.
``I didn't take into account that he could be starting quarterback
material. We missed that one.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no need for excessive self-flagellation. Lucas is the
Jets' starter basically by default. Vinny Testaverde, Parcells's
1998 Pro Bowl reclamation project, had his Achilles' tendon and the
Jets' playoff hopes shredded by the Meadowlands macadam in a
season-opening 30-28 loss to the Patriots. And the only other
alternative is the thoroughly uninspiring Rick Mirer. So Lucas _
who has started one game, a 16-13 loss to the Indianapolis Colts
Oct. 17 in which he completed 16 of 29 passes for 137 yards and a
touchdown before throwing a killing interception and spraining his
ankle _ is getting another chance because . . . well, why not? It's
not as if the Jets, now a gaudy 2-6, have much to risk.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the Patriots, who boast a 6-2 record after having
been off for the last year and a half _ actually, it only seems
that way to Carroll and the players; their bye week hiatus will end
at 14 days Monday _ have much at stake against their AFC East
rivals. And Carroll remembers enough about Lucas to realize he can
wreak havoc.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely have to take into account the option,'' said the
coach. ``We're taking time on the practice field to prepare for
other things they can do. If Ray wasn't in there, they probably
wouldn't be running the option. When we blitz, we have to get him.
We have to keep him crowded. If we miss and he finds the seam in
the D-line, he's got a lot of open space.''
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, this message has been tattooed on the Patriot
defenders' psyches, and they are duly wary. Some even can see
conspiracy theories in Parcells's game plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's something fishy about this,'' said defensive
tackle Chad Eaton. ``I think they'll pull something out of the hat
_ going for it on fourth down or faking a punt with (Tom) Tupa
(another ex-Patriot who doubles as a quarterback). And their punter
is also their holder on field goals . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Those with less suspicious minds are taking Lucas at face value
_ as a double migraine.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know you have to cover your receiver a lot longer,'' said
cornerback Ty Law. ``You have to be ready to play street ball. When
he starts scrambling, fundamentals go out the window.''
</P>
<P>
   The secret is not to let Lucas get out of touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a quarterback that can run the ball,'' said defensive
tackle Henry Thomas, ``you have to be ready for his speed. There's
a lot of different things he does.''
</P>
<P>
   While his former colleagues are leery of Lucas, they also
applaud him for sticking with his dream. ``He was always a
quarterback at heart,'' said Law. ``He enjoyed that more than
anything. He played wide receiver because he had to, and he did a
good job at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tedy Bruschi particularly admires Lucas's resolve; Bruschi
arrived in New England the same year in a similar situation _
having played one position in college (down lineman at Arizona) and
being converted to another (linebacker).
</P>
<P>
   ``We were on the same path here,'' said Bruschi. ``Now we're
doing what we were groomed to do and playing against each other.
It's very exciting, if you ask me. It's nice to see him get a
chance like this.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as he doesn't make too much of it at Carroll's expense
again.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Five-time Pro Bowl linebacker Andre Tippett will be inducted
into the Patriots Hall of Fame during pregame ceremonies. Tippett
will be honored in conjunction with alumni weekend. At halftime,
other Patriots of yore will be saluted as part of the team's 40th
anniversary . . . Wide receiver Troy Brown is expected to suit up
after missing three games with a sprained ankle, but Carroll hasn't
determined whether he will resume his regular punt return duties .
. . Quarterback Michael Bishop has attracted a great deal of
interest from NFL Europe. ``Teams are calling all the time,'' said
Carroll. But it's uncertain whether Bishop will be asked to go or
will agree to go. ``We'll see how things are at the end of the
season,'' said Carroll. ``We can't make him get on the plane.''

PROSECUTORS WRAP UP CASE AGAINST JASPER SUSPECT 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ The Jasper County Courthouse clock chimed 3
o'clock Friday, breaking the eerie quiet inside as prosecutors
wrapped up their capital murder case against Shawn Berry with a
silent video retracing the trail of James Byrd Jr.'s gruesome
dragging death.
</P>
<P>
   But the drama of Berry's trial so far hardly compares with those
of his two co-defendants, white supremacists Bill King and Russell
Brewer, who were convicted earlier this year and sentenced to death
by injection.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they have here is a murder looking for a motive as far as
Shawn Berry is concerned,'' said defense attorney Joseph C. ``Lum''
Hawthorn. ``He's not a racist. He's not a hateful person. They're
searching around trying to figure out, how are they going to
explain to this jury that he's guilty of this?
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury is gonna want to know,'' he added, ``why in the world
would somebody do something like this, something as horrific as
this, without a motive?``
</P>
<P>
   But Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray said he's
confident that the jury paid attention and will be able to follow
the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's his truck. He's there. I believe there's substantial
evidence he was driving the truck,'' Gray said. ``And he's got
blood on him.``
</P>
<P>
   Berry, a 24-year-old local movie theater manager, is expected to
testify sometime next week, and Hawthorn said he plans to bring in
a blood expert to explain how several small spots of Byrd's blood
ended up on Berry's jeans, shirt and boots if he didn't help the
other two kill Byrd early on June 7, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But if Berry takes the stand, prosecutors will force him to try
to reconcile seven sometimes conflicting statements he gave to
police, as well as statements he made during a television interview
with CBS anchor Dan Rather, aired on ``60 Minutes II'' in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said that even if Berry changes his mind and chooses
not to testify, they have already shown not just that Berry was
present at the crime scene, which he admits, but also that he
participated as Byrd was beaten, stripped and chained by the ankles
to Berry's pickup.
</P>
<P>
   They also insist that footprint evidence on a rural road east of
Jasper indicates Berry drove the truck that dragged Byrd for more
than two miles as he fought to keep his head off the pavement,
grinding his elbows and knees to the bone in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's misery ended when his head slammed into a concrete
culvert, decapitating him. The next morning, a local man discovered
his mangled corpse in the middle of Huff Creek Road, outside a
black cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   The hideous nature of the racist crime shocked the nation and
prompted armed black activists and the Ku Klux Klan to march on the
East Texas town of 8,000.
</P>
<P>
   In the first trial last February, every day brought new,
incredible information about defendant Bill King. Jurors were shown
color blowups of the ex-con and Klansman's racist tattoos,
including one depicting a black man hanging from a tree. They read
numerous letters and other documents written by the 25-year-old
King, whom prosecutors portrayed as a violent racist who spent his
time in prison dreaming of returning home to Jasper to start his
own hate group.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Berry, they were told, may have been his first recruit,
and Byrd's killing, his initiation rite. Yet in Berry's trial, the
all-white jury has been told nothing of that theory.
</P>
<P>
   In King's trial, as well as in Brewer's earlier this fall,
prosecutors made a point of pulling the murder weapon, a 24-foot
logging chain, across the courtroom and allowing it to fall loudly
onto the floor. They carefully choreographed their witnesses to
build to a climax, the silent 11-minute video showing the dragging
marks.
</P>
<P>
   In Berry's trial, Hawthorn stole that thunder before noon on the
first day, jumping in early on cross-examination to introduce the
chain and videotape himself.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses also seemed more mechanical in their testimony this
week, as if they were tired of repeating the same evidence for the
third time.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have said all along that Berry's case would be
harder to prove than the other two because he did not have a
reputation as a racist and did not have the criminal background of
King or the 32-year-old Brewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is much more like a soap opera,'' Gray said. ``It's
more about who do you believe.``
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors insist jurors will see through Berry's story, which
witnesses have testified changed every time he was confronted with
new evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``To think that anyone could do to any human being that kind of
thing is just unbelievable,'' said Byrd's sister, Betty Boatner,
who left the courtroom along with another sister, Stella Brumley,
as the pathologist took the witness stand to testify about Byrd's
autopsy. ``And to sit there, like there is no shame in his game, I
just don't understand.``
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courthouse later, another of Byrd's sisters, Mylinda
Washington, said the family was pleased with the case prosecutors
made against Berry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel strongly in the prosecution's case and we have
confidence in the judicial system,'' she said. ``Hopefully we'll be
pleased with the outcome.``

SOUTH CAROLINA IN QUANDARY OVER CONFEDERATE FLAG CONTROVERSY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Carrying the battle flag of the Confederacy
through this birthplace of the Civil War, the hundreds of men
parading in their gray uniforms and the women in their black
widow's weeds knew exactly what was at stake in their struggle over
the memory of an earlier era.
</P>
<P>
   Their immediate journey was to rebury the remains of 22
Confederate sailors and a 3-year-old boy whose first resting place
had mistakenly been covered by the football stadium at the Citadel,
the military college here.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the marchers and the 2,500 others who joined
them at Magnolia Cemetery on Friday were there to invest the
history and the symbols of the region with tangible meaning, which
at that moment were under attack by many who see them in far
less-glorious terms.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few hours earlier, Gov. Jim Hodges had spent the morning
asking business leaders to help him find an honorable way to remove
the battle flag from atop the State Capitol. It has flown there,
usually in the face of many offended people, since 1962. The
Legislature, which is debating a bill to remove the flag, has
resisted efforts to take down the flag, even after South Carolina
became the last state flying it.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious of those efforts began this summer, when the
national and local branches of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People gave up trying to negotiate the
removal of the flag and announced an economic boycott of South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing the effects of the boycott and the growing damage to the
state's reputation, an increasing number of organizations have
called for the flag's removal, including the South Carolina Chamber
of Commerce, the state Baptist Convention and Bob Jones University,
a bastion of the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   But even some legislators who might be inclined to compromise
say they won't do so while an economic musket is pointed at their
heads, and much of that traditional, prideful stubbornness was on
display Friday at Magnolia Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd, entirely white, was hardly representative of the
state, but many of those present said they had felt a twinge of
resentment when a national organization tried to tell them what
symbols their state was allowed to display.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of South Carolina have the right to choose what
flags they want to fly,'' said George Bragdon, a warehouse
supervisor from Lancaster, who was dressed in the gray flannel of
the 12th South Carolina Brigade, Company I, in which his
great-grandfather had served. ``No one from any other state can
tell us what to do. I would remind the NAACP that the South was
willing to go to war to protect its states' rights, and we are
still stubborn enough not to give in to this boycott.''
</P>
<P>
   Hodges, though he is eager to have the flag removed, essentially
had the same message in the speeches he has given all week,
including one Friday morning to the state Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NAACP boycott has drawn attention to the problem, which
has been helpful in trying to move it towards closure,'' Hodges
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it is clear that in my discussions with legislators who
hold the cards in whether or not this bill will pass, that the
boycott now stands as an obstacle,'' he added. ``Clearly, the only
way to show progress on this issue, I believe, is for the NAACP to
suspend its boycott as the first step towards resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   If the NAACP agrees to do so, the governor said, he will not
only press the Legislature to move the flag elsewhere on the
statehouse grounds, but will work to enact a state holiday honoring
Martin Luther King Jr. and to build a museum in Columbia that would
reflect the heritage of both blacks and whites in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   But the NAACP has rejected the proposal and intends to continue
its boycott.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight James, executive director of the South Carolina
Conference of Branches of the NAACP, said Friday that it was
ludicrous to try to appease blacks with the offer of a King holiday
and questioned whether an end to the boycott would lead to
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no discussions or negotiations before we called for
these sanctions, and there wouldn't be any if we withdrew,'' James
said. ``We are committed to standing firm to the end, and it is up
to the leadership of the state to change.''
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP's effort is the latest attempt to remove the flag
since it was put up in 1962 as a gesture of defiance to the civil
rights movement. Most recently, then-Gov. David Beasley led a vocal
campaign in 1997 but the Legislature rejected his proposal to take
down the flag.
</P>
<P>
   James and other proponents of removing the flag see it as a
symbol of slavery, and say the flag's presence over the seat of
government is indicative of the racial climate in the state. Many
Southerners, while acknowledging that the flag has been
appropriated by white hate groups, insist that it is not a racist
symbol, but rather a banner under which many of their relatives
fought and died.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a soldier's flag, and that's why it's wrapped around
those caskets right there,'' said Randy Burbage, president of the
Confederate Heritage Trust, the group that dug up the sailors'
remains from under the stadium and organized the reinterment.
``This is our heritage, and if the flag comes down, then next the
monuments will come down, and then the street names, and then we
will forget our history. We can't forget that this was America's
greatest tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Burbage wept as he helped lower the pine caskets into a long
trench grave at Magnolia Cemetery, which was full of 135-year-old
monuments to fallen rebels. The remains were discovered in June
after the Heritage Trust, working with a state archaeologist,
realized that a cemetery from the 1860s was beneath the stadium,
which was built in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   At Friday's ceremony, each of the flags over the coffins was
carefully folded by re-enactors in Confederate uniforms, and each
was handed to a woman dressed in the black hoop skirt and veil.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the crowd sang ``Dixie,'' the soldiers let loose a rebel
yell and there was a barrage of gunpowder salutes from rifles and
artillery pieces.
</P>
<P>
   One state official looking on let loose a barrage of his own,
his mocking voice a reminder of the deep trench that still divides
the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NAACP doesn't care about the flag, they're just doing this
to raise money,'' said state Sen. Arthur Ravenel, a Republican who
represents the Charleston area. ``I would say that not only will
the state not negotiate under threat of a boycott, but we'll never
vote to take down that flag at all.''

FDA PLANS TO REQUIRE FOOD LABELS TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON TRANS
FATS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Faced with mounting evidence that a type of fat
often found in margarine and baked goods raises the risk of heart
disease, the Food and Drug Administration announced plans Friday to
require food manufacturers to include specific information about
these fats on nutrition labels.
</P>
<P>
   The regulation covering the fats, called trans fatty acids or
just trans fats, would be the first significant change in food
labels since the FDA began requiring them in 1993. Nutrition
experts say it is important because trans fats, which are liquid
fats that have been turned into solids, are even more unhealthy
than saturated fats. Yet consumers have no way of knowing which
products contain them.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point in time there is unanimity that trans fats are a
problem,'' said Dr. Walter Willett, chairman of the nutrition
department at the Harvard School of Public Health. ``We sometimes
refer to them as a stealth fat because you eat them and they are
not on the label.''
</P>
<P>
   The label changes will not take effect right away. The FDA
intends to publish the proposal in the Federal Register next
Wednesday, and the public will have 90 days after that to comment
on it. It could be as long as a year from now before a final rule
is published, and two years after that before consumers see any
changes, said Joseph A. Levitt, director of the agency's Center for
Food Safety and Applied Nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   Food industry representatives said they would not fight the
rule. But they are likely to raise objections to its details,
particularly a provision that would set limits on the health claims
manufacturers can make about products containing trans fatty acids.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rhona Appelbaum, chief scientist for the National Food
Processors Association, a trade group, called the rule premature.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have liked to see the science evolve further.'' she
said, adding, ``We are still looking at this proposed rule very
closely, making sure that it is truthful, useful and above all,
understandable for consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Trans fats are produced artificially, through a process called
partial hydrogenation that is used to convert liquid vegetable oils
into solid fats that are often used to make margarine, shortening,
baked goods and fast-food french fries. Trans fats are chemically
different from saturated fats, which also raise the risk of heart
disease, and have not been included in saturated fat content on the
nutrition label.
</P>
<P>
   But once in the body, trans fats behave like artery-clogging
saturated fats, increasing LDL, or ``bad'' cholesterol. In
addition, Willett said, trans fats lower HDL, or ''good''
cholesterol. He said the evidence against trans fat had been
building for a decade and had become particularly strong in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement announcing the proposed rule, Dr. Jane E. Henney,
commissioner of food and drugs, called nutrition labels ``a
powerful tool for consumers,'' and added, ``By requiring this
information about trans fatty acids, this proposal should assist
individuals in their efforts to reduct their risk of coronary heart
disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed rule, products containing trans fats would
carry an asterisk or some other mark on the line for saturated
fats, directing consumers to a footnote about trans fats. The
footnote would be optional on foods that contain less than half a
gram of trans fat per serving.
</P>
<P>
   With respect to health claims, for instance, the rule would
require that foods advertised as low in saturated fat be virtually
free of saturated fat, containing no more than a half gram per
serving. Claims about low cholesterol would be permitted only on
food containing less than two grams or less of trans fat and
saturated fat combined.
</P>
<P>
   And there would be a new ``trans fat free'' claim, for foods
containing less than half a gram of trans fat and a half gram of
saturated fat per serving.
</P>
<P>
   Defining these health claims is just as important as providing
information on the nutrition labels, said Dr. Margo Wootan, a
senior scientist for the Center for Science in the Public Interest,
a consumer advocacy group in Washington. In 1994, the center
petitioned the food and drug agency to require disclosure of trans
fat content; Friday's announcement came in response to that
petition.
</P>
<P>
   ``A label of stick margarine boasts that it contains 70 percent
less saturated fat than butter,'' said Dr. Wootan. ``But the
additional three grams of trans fat hidden in each serving means it
doesn't do 70 percent less damage to your arteries.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Dr. Wootan and Willett, of Harvard, said they hoped the
proposal would spur food manufacturers to shy away from using trans
fats in their products. Margarine manufacturers have already begun
to make those changes, using new processing methods that eliminate
the fats, according to Richard Cristol, president of the National
Association of Margarine Manufacturers, a trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Cristol said manufacturers were anxious to post margarine's
trans fat content on nutrition labels, because they think consumers
will be surprised. He said 30 percent of margarines on the market
are made without trans fat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of feel we deserve a little bit of a pat on the
back,'' he said. ``We have made tremendous progress.''

 &HT;    Somalis consider suit against company that barred prayer breaks
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Kurylo
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Anab Aden is a devout Muslim from Somalia who prays
five times a day, a religious obligation she never misses.
</P>
<P>
   So when her boss told her she couldn't pray at work, she was
stunned. When the boss suggested that she pray in the bathroom, she
was so offended she quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``She came and suggested to us, `How about praying in the
bathroom?' The next day, we walked out,'' Aden said in Somali
through an interpreter. ``That's religious discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Aden is one of 33 Somalis from Clarkston who quit their jobs at
Solectron in Suwanee, where they worked in assembly-line jobs
making cellular phones. They had worked at Solectron from one to
six months, and in the beginning they were allowed to take two
5-minute prayer breaks each day.
</P>
<P>
   Muslims pray at certain times of the day. One of the times
coincides with sunset, when the Somalis were at work. When they
pray, Muslims have to find a clean area, remove their shoes and
face Mecca. Some Muslims put prayer rugs on the floor. At various
points during the prayer, Muslims bow, kneel and put their face on
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The prayers, which are said in Arabic, last about three minutes.
But at work, it takes about five minutes counting the time it takes
to get to a prayer area and wash their hands if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The Muslim workers would leave the assembly line individually
and cover for each other so the work got done. But when a new boss
started, ``everything changed,'' Aden said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She came to watch us work and she didn't understand why some
of us would leave for a few minutes,'' said Aden, 25, who has lived
in Atlanta five months. Shortly after the boss found out they were
going to a conference room to pray, the Somalis were told that it
had to stop. Eventually, they said, the conference room was locked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were told that we could not leave the line unless we had to
go to the bathroom,'' Aden said. The assembly line workers got one
10-minute break and a 30-minute lunch break, but at times that
didn't coincide with prayer times.
</P>
<P>
   For three weeks, the Somalis tried to negotiate a settlement
that would allow them to pray during work. They offered to subtract
the prayer time, about 10 minutes, from their 30-minute lunch
break. They told the company that it could deduct the prayer time
from their paychecks. The company rejected both proposals, Aden
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Somalis said management never complained about their work.
``Each line has to make 500 phones every day and we made more than
that, not less,'' said Deqa Mohamed, 21. ``They said our work was
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed also said the Muslims were angered and offended when
management told them they could pray in the bathroom. ``We left
when they said if you want to pray in the bathroom, go ahead,''
said Mohamed, who has lived in Atlanta six years and speaks
English.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement from corporate headquarters in Milpitas, Ca.,
Solectron acknowledges it was asked to address ``unique religious
needs of one particular group of associates.'' The company denied
it told the Somalis to pray in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it ``took their concerns and requirements very
seriously and actively addressed them to look for ways to
accommodate them while maintaining all commitments to all our
constituents.''
</P>
<P>
   Solectron said the prayer break is an issue only for some
Somalis on the second shift, from 3 p.m. to 11 p.m., because one of
the prayer times occurs at sunset.
</P>
<P>
   ``We offered a change in hours to a different shift as an
alternative,'' Solectron said, adding that it provided areas for
prayer and offered to adjust the break periods to accommodate its
Muslim workers. Solectron acknowledged that ``flexibility was
offered'' for ``a brief period of time'' and that ``when normal
production resumed ... scheduled break times were necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Aden and Mohamed said the group was offered third-shift jobs,
during which no prayer breaks would be necessary. At least three
accepted the offer because they support large families and need the
money.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the head of Solectron in California, S. Eric
Shakir, civil rights coordinator for the Council of
American-Islamic Relations in Washington, said the Somalis are
prepared to file a charge of religious discrimination with the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Shakir said CAIR handled 600 work place discrimination
complaints last year, 100 of which had to do with prayer breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's generally a misunderstanding or ignorance'' when it
happens, he said. ``In one case in Minnesota, we had Muslims who
were being told to go outside to pray in the cold. When we wrote a
letter to them, the CEO immediately provided a space for them to
pray inside.''
</P>
<P>
   About 5,000 Somalis live in metro Atlanta, according to the
Somali Refugee Family Foundation, a nonprofit agency in Clarkston
that helps Somalis find jobs. Islam is a fast-growing religion in
the United States, which is home to about 5 million Muslims. With
at least 12 mosques, Atlanta's Muslim population is booming as
well. An estimated 50,000 Muslims practice their faith in
communities from Fayetteville to Lawrenceville.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed, who lives in Norcross, got a new job in the jewelry
department at a Kmart in Buford and says she can take prayer breaks
whenever she needs to. ``I get two 15-minute breaks a day and I can
take my break whenever I want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Ali Liban Sanyare, 36, found a new job at Hertz car rentals in
Clarkston and said his new boss has gone out of his way to
accommodate his need to pray. ``He gave me a special place where I
can pray.''
</P>
<P>
   But Aden and most of the other Somalis have not yet found new
jobs. And they worry about how to meet their financial obligations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're willing to do anything we have to, to pray,'' Aden said.

A CAUTIOUS VETERAN VS. A GALLANT WARRIOR

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Evander Holyfield may be facing his last fight while
Lennox Lewis may be facing his last chance.
</P>
<P>
   For the 37-year-old Holyfield, Saturday night's heavyweight
unification fight is a last grasp at greatness, a final attempt to
convince boxing skeptics that he is what he has so often shown
himself to be _ the finest heavyweight of his time.
</P>
<P>
   To defeat Lewis and add the World Boxing Council title belt to
the International Boxing Federation and World Boxing Association
ones he will wear into the ring would mean Holyfield had beaten
every great or near-great heavyweight and cruiserweight of his era.
Mike Tyson, Riddick Bowe, Michael Moorer, Dwight Muhammad Qawi,
Buster Douglas, Lewis, and a wide assortment of lesser lights all
would have fallen to him. Not one of Holyfield's peers can even
claim to have fought such competition, let alone triumphed over
each one.
</P>
<P>
   But if he loses, as many are predicting, what will it mean? Will
it tarnish all he has accomplished in becoming a three-time
heavyweight champion? Will it cause some to rewrite his history?
</P>
<P>
   If it does, it would be the final indignity Holyfield is forced
to suffer in a long and decorated career in which he has heard
repeatedly that he was too small, too old, or, as some say is the
case, too small and too old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who else has done what he's done?'' asked Don Turner,
Holyfield's trainer and a boxing man dating back to the days when
he watched Ezzard Charles train in Cincinnati before anyone knew
how great Charles was. ``Who else has fought every one? What more
does he have to do?''
</P>
<P>
   For some, beat Lewis. But if Holyfield doesn't, it will be the
unyielding calender that has beaten him, not the towering Brit.
Holyfield is a veteran of 40 wars that have left him 36-3-1 and
with less bounce in his legs than he once had.
</P>
<P>
   A 37-year-old fighter is a senior citizen, only two of whom have
ever won the heavyweight title at such an advanced age. If
Holyfield can become the third, he will have added one last
accomplishment to a remarkable collection of unexpected
achievements and cemented his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   But what of Lewis? What does the strapping Brit have at stake?
</P>
<P>
   Only everything. Only his legacy. Only his past and his future.
</P>
<P>
   If the 34-year-old Lewis cannot find a way to destroy Holyfield,
he will be forever dismissed as a figment of England's imagination.
Twice he has won the WBC title, but neither time was there a
champion available for him to beat to do it. His biggest wins have
come over the likes of Razor Ruddock, Frank Bruno, and Ray Mercer,
legitimate heavyweights but second-class citizens when measured
against Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, when Lewis appeared to have his moment come last March in
New York, he chose not to seize it, opting instead to try and coast
to a safe victory rather than gamble on greatness. What resulted
was a draw that denied him both the unified title and the glory he
sought, an approach Holyfield found quite telling.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is not what you'd call a convenient-type job,''
Holyfield said. ``I have to do what is necessary. The price you
have to pay for that is to take yourself out of the comfort zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people don't want to be uncomfortable. I truly believe
Lennox had the opportunity of a lifetime to be the undisputed
champion. But he didn't take that chance because he said, `I may
get caught.' In life, we all may get caught, but we all have to
take chances to be a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a winner but some people don't have the fortitude. Some
people don't have what's necessary to take chances to be the very
best they can be. Boxing is a replica of what people are. At least
I know the man for what he is.''
</P>
<P>
   What Lewis has appeared to be throughout his career is a
cautious combat veteran, not a warrior. While Holyfield has time
and again rushed into the breech and fired back against long odds
with his fists and his heart, Lewis has shown a willingness to
attack only under the safest of conditions.
</P>
<P>
   This week a European fight guy of long experience who did not
want to be named pointed out that his countryman's most
overpowering victories have all come against non-Americans. He
destroyed the stiff-standing Foul Pole, Andrew Golota, in one
round. He did the same to the Canadian heavyweight Ruddock, rushing
in to blast him out without fear eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But against top Americans such as Holyfield, Mercer, and even
young Shannon Briggs for a time, Lewis has been often tentative and
always unwilling to risk all in exchange for dominance. That
approach has won him two world titles and millions of dollars, but
it has failed to bring him the mantle of greatness he says he
wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like he gets in with the European or British fighters and
says, `I know who you are, I've been where you've been,' and
destroys them but the Americans who come from the historically
proper spawning grounds for great fighters create doubt in his
mind,'' the old British fight guy said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Lewis now concedes he was not bold enough in the first
fight, saying ``I could have done more. I played it safe. I was a
bit too cautious, but Evander can do a lot of damage if you let
him. I didn't want to take any chances and leave myself open.''
</P>
<P>
   All week he has vacillated between boldness and blandness. One
minute he talked of scientific boxing and the aim of hitting but
not being hit. The next he was promising ``fireworks'' in the first
round and a resolve to ``stay in his face.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the best way for Lewis to win is to follow his nature and
avoid Holyfield's baiting. He should use his six-inch reach
advantage (84-78) to jab an old man silly, as he did in the first
fight. With Holyfield's legs no longer the pistons they once were,
Lewis can probably control the night with his jab and a thunderous
right hand behind it, followed by much clinching and pressing down
on the back of Holyfield's head if he manages to get inside on him,
a pattern Lewis followed in the first match.
</P>
<P>
   But although victory and the unified title might well come from
that, glory will not. To achieve more than mere victory, boldness
is required. He who dares, does, and Lewis has never shown an ounce
of that in his 36-fight career except for those few minutes with
Golota and Ruddock, and he has paid dearly for it. Will he choose
to risk all he has in the search for greater glory, or will he seek
the safe route through sport's most dangerous place?
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of public perception, Lennox has paid a big price for
being too laid back,'' concedes Emanuel Steward, his trainer. ``He
doesn't need to change his style to win. He just needs to fight
with more fire.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what Holyfield hopes because while that puts him at the
most risk, it also gives him his one chance at victory. Holyfield
understands that when a fighter goes for broke he has the greatest
chance of being broken himself _ a fact Lewis seems to keep
uppermost in his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield has made a proud career of that and it seems likely he
will try it again this one last time. To win he must get inside and
then punch hard and often. He cannot be too bold, but he knows he
must risk all for victory and he is willing to do it. If he can
create a moment of crisis for Lewis, he believes, he can finish him
because it is in such moments that Lewis has looked his worst.
</P>
<P>
   But to do it at his age, there is a need for Lewis to cooperate.
He must come forward himself for Holyfield to find the opening he
needs. Lewis has never done that before, but this week he has at
least talked about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize Evander doesn't have any answers for me,'' Lewis
said. ``I'm going to be right in his face. I think it will be a
good, quick fight. The first round will have a lot of fireworks.
I'm going to go after him and see what he's got.''
</P>
<P>
   If he does, Lennox Lewis will be defying his nature. That may
bring him a great victory or it could bring him what he fears most.
On the road to glory, he may find out an old warrior has some fight
left in him.

&HT;    TOFU ENLISTED IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CANCER

<TEXT>
<P>
   So long, chicken. Hello tofu.
</P>
<P>
   Tofu and a host of other products made from the mighty soybean
are pushing aside meat, milk and even ice cream on grocery store
shelves these days as scientists rave about the health benefits of
soy.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration cleared the
way for food companies to include labels that say eating 25 grams a
day of soy protein, when included in a diet low in saturated fat
and cholesterol, ``may reduce the risk of heart disease.'' Soy
protein boosts good cholesterol and sweeps bad cholesterol out of
the body before it can clog arteries.
</P>
<P>
   But that's old news in the scientific community.
</P>
<P>
   What drew 600 scientists to a conference on soy in Washington,
D.C., on Oct. 31 were the intriguing new findings on the
cancer-fighting properties of isoflavones, a plant-based form of
the hormone estrogen that is unique to the soybean.
</P>
<P>
   Isoflavones appear to help strengthen bones, reduce the
unpleasant symptoms of menopause and, most importantly, control how
quickly cells replicate, which could be beneficial in preventing
the out-of-control cell growth associated with cancer. The National
Cancer Institute recently listed genistein, the main isoflavone in
soy, as one of four ``superior'' anti-cancer agents.
</P>
<P>
   Isoflavones also are showing real potential as a supplement for
hormone replacement therapy in post-menopausal women and as a
bone-fortifying agent to help guard against osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   When Mark Messina, a respected authority on soy products and
adjunct professor of nutrition at Loma Linda University, started
studying soy at the National Cancer Institute in the late 1980s,
there were roughly a dozen scientific papers on the topic and tofu,
the only soy product readily available, was a specialty item tucked
away in health food stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now everybody's talking about soy and cancer, soy and
menopause and all these things,'' Messina said. ``You see
television commercials advertising soy supplements for hot flash
relief and prostate health. Kellogg's announced recently that it's
coming out with a soy cereal. It's clearly very interesting and
intriguing, and that's why a lot of people are talking about it.
And industry is responding with an amazing array of products.''
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean everyone should run out and stuff
themselves with tofu.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence is really intriguing,'' said Messina, whose 1994
National Cancer Institute report on soy as a potential cancer
fighter is considered a cornerstone of the current explosion in
research. ``But one thing is clear: We have a long way to go before
we can speak in a conclusive manner about any of this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Take breast and prostate cancers. There is intriguing evidence
that men who drank isoflavones in soy milk had less risk of
developing prostate cancer, but the results are more mixed when it
comes to breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   One study found a combination of the soy-based soup additive
miso and the anti-cancer drug tamoxifen reduced breast cancer
tumors in lab rats, while there were no changes in rats who only
got the drug. But, according to Dr. Claude Hughes, director for the
Center for Women's Health at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los
Angeles, another study hints that isoflavones might actually
stimulate cancer cell growth in post-menopausal women with low
estrogen levels.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes is also lead investigator on another study that found a
diet high in soy actually can trigger subtle changes in the
development of a fetus. Are those changes good or bad? There's
potential both ways, and right now no one can say for certain which
one will prevail, Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   The problems are complex because people's bodies change with
age, so a diet high in soy might be beneficial at one age and
detrimental at another.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you do?'' Hughes said. ``Well, if you're a man or
woman in your 40s and you're not planning to make babies, having a
few servings of soy foods per week is a good idea. If you are a
28-year-old woman who is actively trying to get pregnant, the
advice is very simple: Eat a broad-based diversified diet. Be a
grazer. Don't eat huge quantities of anything. Don't be a
cheeseburger junkie. Don't be a tofu junkie. Just move around. Eat
a little bit of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The effects of soy are so mild it won't make much of a
difference for anyone when consumed in moderation. Messina said it
takes roughly 60 milligrams of isoflavones a day _ about two
glasses of soy milk _ to get the potential anti-cancer benefits of
soy. It takes four soy entrees to get enough soy protein to help
ward off heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   More definitive answers are coming. The prostate cancer and
child development studies were published in the last three weeks,
about the same time the FDA finally approved the new soy labeling
rules. Messina said where there were only a dozen published studies
on the topic in 1985, there are now more than 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of scientists around the globe are turning their
microscopes to soy in search of ways to prove or disprove its
cancer-fighting ability or its benefit as a natural alternative to
hormone replacement therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Good science requires patience. Messina notes that the first
scientific paper of the heart health benefits of soy protein was
published in 1967, but it took more than two decades for scientists
_ and ultimately the marketplace _ to catch on. And that was easy.
Checking cholesterol is as simple as pricking a finger and drawing
a blood sample. Cancer is more enigmatic, elusive and influenced by
a host of variables scientists are only beginning to understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know soy protein lowers cholesterol, but pretty much most
of the other effects are speculative,'' Messina said. ``There is a
lot of research, but it takes a lot before you can really know
something with any certainty. I can tell you there wouldn't be the
enthusiasm and excitement about soy foods if they were only a good
source of protein that's low in saturated fat. Obviously, people
are hoping it is a lot more than that. And only time will tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Messina and Hughes agree that consumers should embrace soy
products as part of a balanced diet, but not overdo it _ an
American tradition. Soy protein and isoflavones are a good addition
to a healthy lifestyle but will never be that proverbial magic
bullet against disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of looking for magic, maybe we should look for
wisdom,'' Hughes said. ``And the wisdom is to take advantage of
sets of interventions which, hopefully in some additive way, will
be robust in sum total.''
</P>
<P>
   Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles is seeking women
experiencing ``hot flushes'' _ also known as hot flashes _ for a
study of soy-based phytoestrogen's role in moderating the
unpleasant symptoms that mark the onset of menopause.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital's Center for Women's Health is one of 17 sites
conducting a national study of phytoestrogens, which show promise
as a treatment without the side effects of progestin, a hormone
replacement therapy drug.
</P>
<P>
   Women interested in participating in the study can call Dr.
Elaine Revis at (310) 423-0526.

BIG-SPENDING SOX TO COOL IT DURING FREE-AGENT MART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Red Sox, who finished last season with a payroll in
excess of $72 million, are already committed to nearly $155 million
in guaranteed contracts for the next five years, a total eclipsed
by only three teams: the Diamondbacks, Mets, and Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   So while Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette said recently that
the club will always have the means to consider the top 1 or 2
percent of the players available, citing last year's pursuit of
free agent outfielder Bernie Williams, it is not hard to understand
why CEO John Harrington has indicated the team is unlikely to be
engaged in top-dollar pursuits in this winter's free agent mart.
</P>
<P>
   However, the fact that the Sox probably will not have No. 2
starter Bret Saberhagen until at least midseason, and the rest of
the starting rotation is a list of maybes behind the Martinez
brothers, Pedro and Ramon, makes it highly likely that the Sox will
be looking for veteran pitching help entering spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen's close friend, David Cone, filed for free agency on
Thursday, and the 36-year-old righthander who pitched a perfect
game last summer for the Yankees is an intriguing name to consider,
though his $9.5 million salary in '99 suggests he would be too rich
for the Sox tastes.
</P>
<P>
   A's righthander Omar Olivares and Angels lefthander Chuck Finley
are other top names that figure to draw significant interest, while
the pitcher who ranks as perhaps the top attraction on the list,
Rangers righthander Aaron Sele, isn't entertaining any thoughts of
returning to Boston. The Rangers cleared out big bucks by trading
slugger Juan Gonzalez, and are expected to make a big bid to retain
Sele.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, who would also like another productive bat, could take
another run at outfielder Greg Vaughn, whom they talked about
acquiring in a trade from the Padres last season before he was
dealt to the Reds. But again, the Sox are likelier to consider
cheaper alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   A possibility at first base could be David Segui, who opted for
free agency in Toronto and has always been high on Duquette's list,
after playing for the Sox GM in Montreal. Segui would represent a
significant upgrade in defense around the bag, though he would not
be the slugger the Sox ideally would like to sign.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette was still in the Dominican Republic Friday, according
to a club spokesman, but that didn't keep the Sox from making a
minor deal, swapping outfielder Jon Nunnally to the Mets for
outfielder Jermaine Allensworth.
</P>
<P>
   Allensworth, 27, spent most of last season in the minors at
Triple A Norfolk, where he hit. 264 with 5 home runs and 10 stolen
bases in 81 games. He played 40 games as a reserve for the Mets,
batting .209, but came up as a center fielder in 1997 with the
Pirates, which suggests that Duquette could be considering moving
Damon Buford and wants Allensworth as a backup for Darren Lewis.
Like Buford, Allensworth is a righthanded hitter.
</P>
<P>
   In another development, DeMarlo Hale, Baseball America's choice
as Minor League Manager of the Year who threw out a first ball
before a Sox playoff game, reportedly has informed the club that he
plans to look elsewhere for a job after the Sox did not offer him a
promotion from Double A Trenton. The Thunder had the best record in
minor league ball last season, and Hale was offered his job back
for next season. He could still accept, but said he intends to
explore other opportunities in the interim.

MITCHELL ADJOURNS ULSTER TALKS, URGES PARTIES TO WEIGH CONSEQUENCES
OF FAILURE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ With his mission to salvage the
Northern Ireland peace settlement at a crisis point, George J.
Mitchell abruptly adjourned talks Friday morning and urged
negotiators to spend the weekend focusing on ``the gravity of what
is at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   The effort by Mitchell, the American mediator, was shaken
Thursday night by word that the Ulster Unionist leader David
Trimble was unable to gain the support of his party legislators in
a secret ballot on the compromise thrashed out with the rival Sinn
Fein party over the last 10 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Talks, which Mitchell said were at their ``final and most
critical phase,'' are to resume on Monday. Their purpose has been
to end a deadlock over the Ulster Unionists' refusal to admit Sinn
Fein to the Northern Ireland g established by the April 1998 peace
accord before the Irish Republican Army starts disarming. The IRA
views disarmament as surrender, and Sinn Fein, its political
representative, argues that no such condition to take part in
government is in the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The complex formula that Trimble is using to try to break the
impasse involves a series of incremental reciprocal steps by Sinn
Fein and the Ulster Unionists rather than a single dramatic move.
Elements include an IRA statement condemning violence and pledging
not to return to its war against British rule, and the appointment
of a senior IRA official as a go-between to the international
disarmament panel headed by a retired Canadian general, John de
Chastelain.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan does not promise the actual turnover of weapons, an
insistent demand of the increasingly tough-minded Unionists, and
the absence of any such pledge cost it the required support
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   A Unionist spokesman, eager to free the party from the onus of
appearing to be a deal wrecker, said that no final decision had
been made. He explained that the Thursday night vote had merely
been a ``straw poll'' to help Trimble decide whether to put the
matter before the 900-member party council.
</P>
<P>
   The Mitchell review, conducted under a news blackout and on
occasion away from Belfast, has produced a comfort level among
lifelong enemies, establishing heretofore missing elements of trust
and mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
   But Trimble's willingness to deal directly with Sinn Fein has
not pleased many in his party, and whatever effort he makes this
weekend to push for acceptance of the rejected compromise could put
his leadership at risk.
</P>
<P>
   A call for his ouster came not unexpectedly from the Rev. Ian
Paisley, head of the hard-line Democratic Unionists and a fierce
opponent of the peace settlement. He said Trimble was promoting the
admission of ``gangsters and terrorists'' into government.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, challenged Trimble to gain
his party's backing. ``Success in this process requires that those
in political leadership fulfill their responsibilities and give
leadership,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, in a statement Friday morning, said that ``the past
few days have been very intense and accordingly I have asked the
parties to pause over the weekend and reflect on the magnitude of
the decisions they have to make.'' He acknowledged that his mission
had gone on far longer than he had planned, but that ``given the
gravity of what is at stake, it is appropriate to take the time
necessary to thoroughly and completely consider these important
matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, in South Africa for a
Commonwealth meeting, said the parties could not afford to let the
opportunity pass with agreement so near. ``We have never come this
far before,'' he said; ``we have never been this close. It is there
within our grasp.''

 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The NASDAQ Composite Index is no longer simply a
stock index; it's a phenomenon. The index is up an astonishing 46.9
percent this year; in 11 of the last 12 trading days, it has closed
at record highs.
</P>
<P>
   Of the fuels propelling this rocket in recent weeks, none has
been more potent than the semiconductor sector. Shares of companies
that make chips for the world's computers and other electronic gear
have surged on rising sales and higher chip prices.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index
of 16 companies is up 18 percent since Nov. 1. For the year, it is
up 87 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hot does not begin to describe these stocks. Applied Materials,
a semiconductor equipment maker, had sales in the past 12 months of
roughly $4 billion. Its market value is 10 times that figure. The
Altera Corp., a maker of integrated circuits, is trading at
approximately 16 times its $772 million in sales over the past 12
months.
</P>
<P>
   To put this run-up in perspective, during other booms for
semiconductor makers, the stocks rarely traded higher than two
times their sales.
</P>
<P>
   What strikes some as peculiar about the current stampede into
semiconductor shares is that worldwide sales of chips are expected
to rise just 14 percent this year over last. Moreover, a multitude
of computer manufacturers and resellers _ IBM and Inacom, to name
one of each _ have recently warned that the outlook for their
businesses in the fourth quarter and beyond looks worrisome.
</P>
<P>
   Why are investors paying as much as 90 times earnings for
companies whose futures depend on orders from computer makers who
are singing the blues?
</P>
<P>
   Those who study the semiconductor industry _ a very cyclical
business _ say recent sales increases at many of these companies
are a result of an extraordinary inventory buildup by computer
makers in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   These companies placed unusually heavy orders for chips on fears
that an earthquake in Taiwan would cut supplies and in anticipation
of strong computer sales to customers eager to buy before 2000.
</P>
<P>
   If computer demand does not soak up this inventory in the
current quarter _ and IBM's warning of a slow fourth quarter lends
credibility to that fear _ the world will be awash in chips. Prices
will fall again and so will the stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Hickey, editor of the High-Tech Strategist newsletter,
thinks that sales of computers are starting a downward spiral that
will extend into next year: ``We are going into a long period of
decline in computer demand because buying has been accelerated in
the past few years'' mostly by fears of Year 2000 computer
problems. He forecasts a crash in semiconductor orders.
</P>
<P>
   Investors piling into semiconductor shares may not know that
many insiders at these companies are exiting. Insider filings take
time to trickle in, but the selling now looks like a consensus,
according to Bob Gabele, director of insider research at First
Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   From mid-August to late September, for example, seven insiders
at Applied Materials have sold 308,247 shares; two sold more than
half their holdings. The sales are the biggest in any 30-day period
since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   At the Sanmina Corp., a contract maker of circuit boards, five
insiders sold almost 200,000 shares in August. One seller, a
director, cut his position 94 percent. In his first sale since
1996, Eric Lidow, chairman of the International Rectifier Corp., a
maker of semiconductors for the power industry, sold 30 percent of
his position.
</P>
<P>
   ``This tells me the shares in the group are probably ahead of
themselves here,'' Gabele said. ``The insiders all seem to think
their shares have been bid up to unrealistic levels.''

 &HT;    Team salutes fallen Angels
 &HT;    By Bill Osinski
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PENSACOLA, Fla. _ For the men who seize the sky, a homecoming
air show was the best way to let go of a tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Angels _ the Navy's ``maximum-speed,
minimum-separation'' flying team _ performed season-ending shows
for what Navy officials projected could be near-record crowds at
Pensacola Naval Air Station, the team's home. More than 40,000
attended Friday, and perhaps double that number are expected today.
</P>
<P>
   The entire performance was a tribute to Lt. Cmdr. Kieron
O'Connor and Lt. Kevin Colling, the team members killed two weeks
ago when their F/A-18 Hornet crashed during a practice flight at
Moody Air Force Base near Valdosta, Ga. The cause of the crash is
under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have given up; we were close enough to the end of the
season to call it quits,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Doug Verissimo, a Blue
Angels pilot. ``But this way, it lets everybody know that we're
back in business.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, people closest to the Blue Angels program strongly
believe the fallen flyers would have wanted it this way.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to go on,'' said Sandy Miller, wife of the Blue
Angels' maintenance crew chief, Lt. Neal Austin. ``The team goes
on; the Navy goes on; the country goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller added, ``This is a sad day in some ways, but it is also a
celebration of Kieron's and Kevin's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first day of the two-day air show, the celebration was a
display of the type of Blue Angels' aerial magic that most people
accept as routine _ until something happens to remind everyone how
dangerous it really is.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels do things in the air that eagles would never dare. At
speeds up to 1,000 mph, they shriek and spin through their drill,
sometimes in incredibly tight formations, sometimes seemingly
flying right at each other, sometimes upside down.
</P>
<P>
   The names of the maneuvers suggest their intricacy: the
Barrel-roll Break, the Tuck-away Cross, the Split-S Reversal, the
Vertical Roll, the Fleur-de-lis. The streaking aircraft move
through formations that suggest starbursts, or corkscrews, or
flower petals.
</P>
<P>
   But they are not stunts. As much as they push the envelope of
what men and flying machines can do, they are also related to
textbook military flying. Also, Blue Angel pilots all come from and
will return to assignments with the Navy Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   While Friday was a difficult day to fly, there are no friendlier
skies for the Blue Angels than the those over Pensacola.
</P>
<P>
   The city's special relationship with the U.S. Navy goes back to
1825, and its status as home base for the Blue Angels goes back to
1950, said Pensacola Mayor John Fogg, a former Marine aviator who
was a Blue Angels pilot in the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost as if the people of this community are part of the
extended Navy family,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the recent crash, local officials ordered 20,000
blue-ribbon pins for people to wear as a show of support for the
Blue Angels. They were passed out literally in minutes, he said, as
were a second order.
</P>
<P>
   In Navy circles, Pensacola is affectionately referred to as
``the mother-in-law of Naval Aviation'' because so many young male
Navy flyers find their brides while they're stationed in there, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   These kinds of relationships have flourished to the point where
active and retired federal employees account for about one-third of
the region's economy, Fogg said.
</P>
<P>
   But many Pensacolans especially identify with the Blue Angels,
partly because the Angels are such a unique group of men and women.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team's goal is perfection, to fly the most difficult
maneuvers closer and closer,'' Fogg said. ``And when you fly with a
group of people whose lives depend of everybody doing their jobs
right a thousand times out of a thousand, it brings you very close
as people.''
</P>
<P>
   The hundreds of air show spectators wearing Blue Angel support
pins Friday seemed to testify to that bond.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not military or anything, but we just feel a special
affection for the Blue Angels,'' said Dianne Jones of Pensacola.
``They're such an important part of the community here, and they're
the epitome of Navy aviation.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Apke, from Florence, Kent., said the recent accident made
him aware of the thin margin of error that is part of every Angels'
flight. ``They understand that every time they leave the ground,
they might not get back. When I make a mistake at my job, I say,
`I'm sorry,' but these guys ... '' Apke said.
</P>
<P>
   James Ferguson, head of the ROTC program at metro Atlanta's
Southwest DeKalb High School, was one of the leaders of a group of
about 40 student cadets who came to Pensacola for the air show and
to participate in Veterans Day festivities.
</P>
<P>
   He said he hoped that the students take a lesson from the way
the Blue Angels performed in spite of the tragedy: ``You've got to
be able to get back up, after you've been knocked down.''
</P>
<P>
   Fawn Ind, the wife of Angels' pilot Lt. Cmdr. Scott Ind, said
she's been touched by the depth of community support.
</P>
<P>
   On the fence near O'Connor's parking space at the Blue Angels'
headquarters offices, other people have left flowers and poems.
``It's really heart-wrenching to see that the people out in the
community are in almost as much pain as the families of the crew,''
she said.

   After-Hours Trading: Managers Aren't Thrilled &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After-hours trading is upon us. But who will be doing the buying
and selling when the NASDAQ market and New York Stock Exchange
start staying open past their current closing time of 4 p.m.?
NASDAQ is in the midst of the transition, and the Big Board will
make the change next year.
</P>
<P>
   A survey conducted by Midwood Securities, a brokerage firm in
New York, suggests that the traders will not be mutual funds,
pension funds or insurance companies. In October, the firm surveyed
700 institutional money managers with assets of $500 million to
$500 billion; 60 percent of those responding said they would
probably not participate in extended trading hours, and, of the
remainder, almost all said they thought that it would not play an
essential role in their business.
</P>
<P>
   ``If institutions had their way, we wouldn't be extending the
hours,'' said Terry L. March, chief executive of Midwood.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about potential benefits of extended hours, 51
percent said they did not expect any. About one-quarter felt that
it would be useful in reacting to company and industry news,
economic or political developments and earnings reports.
</P>
<P>
   The managers were also asked about their concerns over
after-hours trading. Some 65 percent of the respondents said they
were worried about a possible lack of liquidity and 63 percent
cited the prospects of increased volatility.
</P>
<P>
   So who are the likely beneficiaries of extended trading? No
surprise there _ 68 percent of the managers cited the computerized
trading systems known as electronic communication networks, or
ECNs, many of which already offer after-hours trading.

   FUNDS WATCH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Who Depends Most On Microsoft Stock? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The hottest stock of a generation turned into a hot potato last
week for the mutual funds that own it. After a federal judge
declared that it acts like a monopoly, Microsoft shares fell 2.6
percent last week, to close at $89.1875 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   So, what funds had the largest portions of their portfolios
invested in the company? It is difficult to tell, because funds are
required to disclose their holdings only when they file their
annual or semiannual reports.
</P>
<P>
   One candidate is Ameritor Security Trust, with just $5.2 million
in assets as of June 30. The fund's most recent annual report, also
as of that date, showed that the fund had 22.7 percent of its
portfolio invested in Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   If Ameritor does not sound familiar, that is because the fund's
name has changed twice in the last two years. It is the old
Steadman Associated Trust, one of a family of Steadman funds that
gained notoriety in the past decade by furnishing subpar, often
disastrous, performance.
</P>
<P>
   The fund is under new management. Its portfolio manager, Max
Katcher, said last week that he saw no reason to trim his stake.
Small wonder: Ameritor has returned 17.8 percent in the first three
quarters of the year, handily beating the 5.4 percent return of the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 and other indexes, despite an outsized
expense ratio of nearly 10 percent. The fund was helped, of course,
by its outsized position in Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Other big holders of Microsoft stock, based on their most recent
reports, included an assortment of technology-sector and
over-the-counter index funds.
</P>
<P>
   But several actively managed, diversified funds had large
stakes, too. The L. Roy Papp Stock fund had 11.9 percent of its
portfolio in Microsoft as of Sept. 30; Berkshire Focus, 11.7
percent as of June 30; Wells Fargo Large Company Growth, 9.7
percent as of Aug. 31; Fidelity OTC Portfolio, 8.8 percent as of
July 31; and CitiFunds Large Cap Growth, 8.1 percent as of April
30.

THE REPUBLICAN AIM IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET BATTLE IS SURVIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As this year's budget fight sputters to a close,
Republicans are quietly ceding ground to President Clinton in their
determination to avoid even a hint of the kind of ideological
conflagration that led to the government shutdown four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Compromise by compromise, they have added more than $5 billion
to their spending bills in the last few weeks alone and given
Clinton a victory on a politically significant education program.
</P>
<P>
   A similar series of concessions last fall caused conservatives
to become so rebellious that Newt Gingrich, then the speaker of the
House, lashed out at them as ``the perfectionist caucus.'' But this
year _ at least so far _ the rank and file is showing few signs of
resistance.
</P>
<P>
   The mood underscores the Republican view that this first session
of the 106th Congress was about little more than survival under
dire circumstances. They opened the year with a razor-thin House
majority, an untested new speaker, poll ratings driven down by the
impeachment of the president and divisions between conservatives
and moderates.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with only a handful of issues left to negotiate with
Clinton, they want to go home, satisfied that they maintained a
semblance of unity within their ranks this session, even if they
cannot point to many legislative accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   Adjournment would also stop the Democrats, who have been newly
buoyed by an array of polls, from highlighting all the things that
have been left undone, like gun control, campaign finance reform
and regulation of managed health care.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the budget, Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said,
``Everybody wants it done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a titanic battle,'' he said. ``These issues don't
reshape government for 100 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Anne Northup, R-Ky., referred to her party's razor-thin
majority in the House, and said, ``Considering the narrow margin, I
think we have adhered to our principles as best we can.''
</P>
<P>
   From the start of the year, mindful of their weaknesses, the
Republicans set only modest goals for themselves. They wanted an
orderly budget process to show the public that they can govern
responsibly. They pledged to adhere to the strict spending limits
set by the bipartisan balanced budget law of 1997. And they wanted
to showcase a handful of issues: social security, education, tax
cutting and national defense.
</P>
<P>
   While they failed to stay within the spending limits and their
tax cut was vetoed by the president, Republicans say that this
year's spending fight has allowed them to claim some success.
</P>
<P>
   To bolster their stand on national security, they gave the
Pentagon more money than Clinton asked for and provided a raise for
military personnel that was larger than what he requested.
</P>
<P>
   On education, they can share credit with Clinton for financing
his program for 100,000 new teachers over seven years. And because
the administration, in a nod to Republicans, agreed that 25 percent
of the money could go to teacher training instead of hiring, they
can say they at least made headway in their push for more
flexibility in the use of federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   And they believe they scored a tactical victory with their
approach to Social Security. It was Clinton who in 1998 first
talked about protecting the Social Security reserves as a way of
deflecting Republicans from tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   But this year the Republicans turned the tables and took up the
cry with even more enthusiasm as a way of deterring government
spending during a time of surplus. They even ran commercials saying
that it was the Democrats who were trying to raid Social Security
for government spending.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that the public does not see Republicans as the
protectors of Social Security, and Democrats charge that the
Republicans can make that claim only by using a host of accounting
tricks and gimmicks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Republicans argue that they have created a potent
political fire wall against government spending that should last
for a long time since neither party will want to be accused of
being the one to dip into the Social Security surplus.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Republicans _ and I am one _ feel we tempered the drive
of the White House and some Democrats to spend more money,'' said
Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   This stand explains why one of the last remaining issues in the
budget talks is the Republicans' insistence that the White House
produce a list of spending cuts to offset the billions that have
been added into Clinton's preferred programs. Otherwise, Congress
will not make good on its pledge to avoid touching the Social
Security reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to close this budget without dipping into Social
Security,'' House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, insisted
this week.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' biggest failure was their inability to meet the
spending limits in the 1997 balanced budget law. But unlike 1998,
when the final budget deal resulted in $20 billion more in spending
than envisioned by the balanced budget act, this year the dollars
have added up slowly bill by bill. There was never a moment of
sticker shock.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even before the last few weeks of negotiations, the
nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that the majority's
spending bills had acceded the caps in the budget law by more than
$30 billion.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Conservatives could still rebel next week and vote against the
final spending deal when they see the last compromises or if they
are unhappy with the outcome of another remaining issue _ U.N.
dues.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration wants to pay the nearly $1 billion
the United States owes the United Nations in back dues. The money
has been tied up over conservatives' insistence that the United
States bar financing to international organizations that promote
abortion rights overseas. Clinton said Friday that he was looking
for a compromise and that ``I hope we can work it out.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of Democrats may also vote against a budget deal. That
would allow them to thwart any Republican attempts to paint them as
big spenders who want to raid Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Democrats were even looking for a way to tar
Republicans as the ones raiding Social Security. House Minority
Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., said the Democrats would insist that
the Congressional Budget Office certify any budget deal. In the
past, the Congressional Budget Office has indicated when accounting
tricks have been used to hide raiding of the Social Security fund.
</P>
<P>
   Most Democrats have already moved on from the budget debate to
focus on the set of issues that they believe will give them an edge
in their drive to take back the House and make gains in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   They treat each new dawn in Congress these days as an
opportunity to talk about the issues that have gone into
legislative limbo: gun control or regulation of health maintenance
organizations or an increase in the minimum wage or a Medicare
prescription drug program for the elderly. This week they even
unveiled a campaign commercial featuring grainy black-and-white
pictures of tombstones marked with the names of dead issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the issues that Democrats have helped push onto the
national agenda with no help from Republicans,'' Gephardt said
Friday, making it clear that next year these issues will form the
Democratic election platform.

   WASHINGTON _ Survivors of a killing of South Korean civilians by
U.S. troops in 1950 told their stories to military officials Friday
and received assurances that a thorough review would be conducted
``as a tribute to the shared sacrifices of the Korean and American
people during the Korean War.''
</P>
<P>
   A few dozen South Koreans survived the attack at No Gun Ri, a
small village in South Korea where, witnesses have said, American
soldiers killed hundreds of civilian refugees in the early stages
of the Korean War. Some soldiers have since acknowledged their
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Four survivors of the attack came to the Pentagon Friday,
meeting with Charles L. Cragin, deputy undersecretary of defense;
Patrick T. Henry, assistant secretary of the Army; and Lt. Gen.
Michael Ackerman, inspector general of the Army.
</P>
<P>
   Army and Defense Department officials, in a statement after the
meeting, reiterated a pledge to continue to work closely with the
South Korean government to ``vigorously pursue and publish the
facts'' of what happened at No Gun Ri in July 1950.

<P>
   After the August 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania, the United States accused Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born
construction tycoon, of financing terrorist camps in Somalia,
Egypt, Sudan, Yemen, Egypt and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, America fired cruise missiles at bin Laden's
camps in eastern Afghanistan, killing nearly 20 militants but
leaving his network unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   Washington demanded bin Laden's extradition. But the Taliban,
who rule Afghanistan, refused to comply.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban emerged in late 1994 as a messianic movement made up
of ``taliban'' (literally, students) from Islamic ``madrasahs''
(seminaries) who were living as refugees in Pakistan. They vowed to
bring peace to wartorn Afghanistan, establish law and order, disarm
the population and impose ``sharia'' (Islamic law).
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, the nature of the Taliban _ who they are and what
they represent _ has been difficult for outsiders to understand
because of the excessive secrecy that surrounds their leaders and
political structure.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban do not issue policy statements or hold regular press
conferences. There is no Taliban manifesto. Because of the strict
religious ban on photography and television, Afghans do not even
know what their new leaders look like. The one-eyed Taliban
religious leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, does not meet with
non-Muslims and so remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Taliban's purist ideology and the Pakistani recruits it
has nurtured have had immense cross-border repercussions in
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   An already fragile nation in the midst of an identity crisis,
economic meltdown, ethnic and sectarian division _ and a military
regime that overthrew the government of former Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif in October _ Pakistan could easily be submerged by a new
fundamentalist wave led by neo-Taliban groups.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Pakistan's support for the Taliban is coming back to
haunt it. By 1998, neo-Taliban parties had become a major influence
in the Pakistani provinces of Baluchistan and the North West
Frontier Province.
</P>
<P>
   In those regions, they had begun banning television and videos,
imposing ``sharia'' punishments such as stoning and amputation,
assassinating Pakistani Shiite Muslims and forcing women to adopt
the restrictive Taliban dress code. Their influence is now starting
to creep elsewhere into Pakistan _ to Punjab and Sind.
</P>
<P>
   Already in July the Jamiat-ul-Ulema-e-Islam (JUI), a strongly
anti-Western political party, issued death threats to all Americans
in Pakistan, to be carried out if bin Laden is extradited to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan is reluctant to help the United States capture bin
Laden, if only because it would create the appearance that
Islamabad was seen to do Washington's bidding.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudi dilemma is even worse. Saudi Arabia has helped finance
the Taliban and has provided crucial military support for their
offensives. After the U.S. embassy bombings in Africa, the Saudis
suspended diplomatic relations with the Taliban and ostensibly
ceased all aid. They did not, however, withdraw diplomatic
recognition and private donations continue to flow.
</P>
<P>
   Like Pakistan, Saudi Arabia would like to leave bin Laden in
Afghanistan. His arrest and trial in the United States could be
highly embarrassing, exposing his continuing relationship with
sympathetic members of the ruling elites and intelligence services
of both countries.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1994 and 1999, an estimated 80,000 to 100,000 Pakistanis
trained and fought in Afghanistan. By now, the JUI and its many
breakaway factions have become the main recruiters of Pakistani and
foreign students to fight for the Taliban. These battle-hardened
militants now gravely threaten Pakistan's own stability.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the thousands of foreign radicals now fighting
alongside the Taliban in Afghanistan are determined to someday
overthrow their own regimes and carry out Taliban-style revolutions
in their homelands.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Chechnya-based militants who took over parts of
Dagestan in July included in their ranks Arabs, Afghans and
Pakistanis, most of whom had fought in the '80s Afghan holy war, or
``jihad,'' against the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main recruiters of Arab militants for the Afghan
jihad was bin Ladin. As the richest and highest-ranking Saudi to
participate in the struggle, he was heavily patronized by both
Pakistani and Saudi intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Ladin left Afghanistan in 1990 but returned in May 1996.
Striking up a friendship with Omar, the Taliban chief, bin Ladin
moved to Omar's base in Kandahar in early 1997. Bin Ladin reunited
and rearmed the Arab militants still remaining in Afghanistan after
the war against the Soviets, creating the ``055'' brigade. The
Taliban had no contact with Arab Afghans or pan-Islamic ideology
until then.
</P>
<P>
   But Omar was quickly influenced by his new friend and became
increasingly vociferous in his attacks on Americans, the United
Nations and the Saudis and other pro-Western Muslim regimes. Recent
Taliban statements reflect a bin Ladin-style outrage, defiance and
pan-Islamism that the Taliban had never used before his arrival.
</P>
<P>
   By now U.S. officials claim that, with most of his bank accounts
frozen, bin Laden finances his operations through opium.
Afghanistan now produces three times more opium than the rest of
the world put together. Ninety-six percent of it is cultivated in
Taliban-controlled areas, making the Taliban the largest heroin
producer in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Drug Control Program reports that Afghanistan produced
4,600 metric tons of opium in 1999 _ twice as much as in the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
   And the Taliban collect a 20 percent tax from opium dealers and
transporters _ money that goes straight to the Taliban war chest.
Drug dealers operate the only banking system in Afghanistan _
offering farmers credit in advance of their poppy crop. This
criminalized economy has weakened states throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, chaos in Afghanistan is seeping through its
porous borders. Its ongoing civil war has polarized the region,
with Pakistan and Saudi Arabia backing the Taliban, while Iran,
Russia, India and four former Soviet Central Asian republics
support the opposition Northern Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation is producing enormous economic disruption
throughout the area, as the Afghan warlords' dependence on
smuggling and drug trafficking grows insatiable.
</P>
<P>
   A 1999 World Bank study estimates that the smuggling trade
between Pakistan and Afghanistan alone amounted to $2.5 billion in
1997, equivalent to more than half of Afghanistan's estimated gross
domestic product. Add to that the smuggling to and from the rest of
the region and the total rises to $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   This smuggling has crippled local industry in all the affected
states; local factories cannot compete with smuggled, foreign-made,
duty-free consumer goods. The smuggling also creates huge losses in
customs revenue and sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   According to Pakistan's Central Board of Revenue, Pakistan's
losses in 1998 amounted to 30 percent of the government's total
revenues of $6 billion. The Taliban tax on the smuggling trade was
its second-largest source of income after drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Afghan opium was exported to the West through Pakistan
in the 1980s, there are now multiple export routes through Iran,
the Persian Gulf states and Central Asia. As these routes expand,
so do the beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   New transport and smuggling mafias have developed in
Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Iran. They are ignored by
their governments, due to a web of corruption that benefits
everyone from border guards to cabinet ministers. Not surprisingly,
all these transport mafias are keen supporters and major funders of
the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   And this illegal economy is only expanding, since Afghanistan's
formal one remains nonexistent. The Afghan infrastructure is
devastated, health care and education are virtually absent, and
abject poverty is rampant. Afghanistan today has six working
factories, compared to 220 in 1979. Fighting and smuggling offer
the only employment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Washington's sole response so far has been its
single-minded obsession with bringing to justice the now-legendary
</P>
<P>
   bin Laden _ hardly a comprehensive policy for dealing with this
increasingly volatile part of the world.

   In New Jersey Politics, No Goldman Rematch &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So much for Goldman versus Goldman. Lewis M. Eisenberg, chairman
of the Port Authority, announced last week that he would not seek a
Senate seat from New Jersey, forgoing a rerun of an old Wall Street
grudge match. Eisenberg, 57, would have been fighting for the
Republican nomination and a possible match against Jon S. Corzine,
52, a leading contender on the Democratic side.
</P>
<P>
   Both men are natives of Illinois who earned considerable
fortunes at Goldman Sachs Group. Both became players in New Jersey
politics after their Goldman careers were cut short.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenberg resigned his partnership at Goldman, where he headed
the firm's equity sales division, under pressure after he violated
a policy against having a sexual relationship with a subordinate in
1989. Corzine scaled the firm's hierarchy to become senior partner,
the top boss, in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   One former colleague of both said that Eisenberg long had his
eyes on the job Corzine eventually landed.
</P>
<P>
   A rematch was made possible when Corzine fell victim to a palace
coup at Goldman early this year. He resigned and quickly set his
sights on the Senate. ``Deep down I think Lew was looking for
revenge,'' said one retired partner who knew both men. ``We all
thought it's crazy. Given the history, it looks like he thought
better of it, too.''
</P>

   Return of the Munchkins &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nobody can accuse Brian Brille, an investment banker, of
forgetting the little people. He invited some of them to his annual
Halloween party _ as part of his costume.
</P>
<P>
   At his house on eastern Long Island, Brille was dolled up as
Glinda the Good Witch from ``The Wizard of Oz'' and flanked by
three dwarfs he had hired for the evening to be his munchkins.
Brille, who specializes in the health-care industry at the
investment banking unit of Bank of America, spent about $3,000 on
his get-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people were taken aback'' by Brille's human accessories,
said one partygoer, but others were amused by another sign of good
times on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Brille's sidekicks were not the only little people there. When
Scott Brakebill, one of Brille's colleagues, showed up on a
chartered bus full of guests from Manhattan, he was dressed as Dr.
Evil, a character from the ``Austin Powers'' movies. At his side
was Scott Seidman, in an identical _ albeit much smaller _ outfit
as Dr. Evil's alter ego, Mini-Me.
</P>
<P>
   Seidman, who is 4 feet tall, proved that there were at least
three deal makers at the party. After agreeing to be one of
Brille's munchkins, he backed out of the deal when a talent agency
offered him the splashier, more lucrative role of Mini-Me. ``I
didn't have a contract,'' Seidman said. ``So I canceled the other
job.''
</P>
<P>
   His earnings for the party, which lasted into the wee hours,
were $650 plus a generous tip, he said: ``It was great. We tore the
place up.''

United Way of America must pay to its former president, William V.
Aramony, who has been in federal prison since 1995 for
embezzlement. At issue, in pension language, is whether being a bad
boy should keep him from wearing a top hat.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, United Way directors approved for Aramony a ``top hat''
pension plan _ worth $4.2 million on top of his standard pension.
Even then, a judge has found, Aramony was already stealing from the
charity for himself, his teenage girlfriend and a second executive.
</P>
<P>
   The draft of the top-hat plan shown to the board included a
``bad boy'' clause that denied Aramony benefits if he committed a
felony. That language never made its way into the final agreement
drafted by Mutual of America, a pension plan administrator, and
signed for the board by Aramony's confederate.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Shira A. Scheindlin of federal district court in
Manhattan, ruled that because no evidence of collusion between
Aramony and Mutual of America was presented, he should get the
money, less about $2 million in forfeited salary and investigative
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Now the judge must interpret a tax law to decide whether Aramony
gets the $2.2 million difference or just $550,000. Then United Way
of America will decide whether to sue Mutual of America, which says
it has acted properly, for whatever Aramony collects because of the
missing clause.

MURPHY TO PLAY SATURDAY, BUT IN BRUINS UNIFORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It appeared that free agent right wing Joe Murphy was
about to sign a contract with the New York Rangers, who he had been
practicing with for about a week.
</P>
<P>
   Word out of New York is that he was supposed to meet Friday
morning with Rangers general manager Neil Smith, perhaps to
finalize a deal, but when he didn't show up, the Rangers were
baffled.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the 32-year-old Murphy was agreeing to terms on a
one-year deal with the Bruins that reportedly will pay him a $1
million base salary, plus scoring incentives that could yield
another $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   In an odd twist, Murphy will suit up for the Bruins Saturday
night against the Rangers at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   But the story gets more curious. Murphy said Friday that Smith
was so upset the winger had signed with Boston that the Rangers GM
threw one of Murphy's skates into Long Island Sound and cut his
sticks in half.
</P>
<P>
   Reports out of New York were that Murphy and Rangers assistant
coach Charlie Huddy engaged in an argument at Rye Playland, where
the Rangers practice, because of Murphy's decision and because
Murphy was upset about his missing and destroyed equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Neil on a number of occasions and he kept telling
me he was going to meet me and see me at the game,'' said Murphy.
``He would say hi and he was nice and stuff, but lip service only
goes so far. I'm out laying it on the line in practice. If they
turn me back, I go home and I have no contract, and every other
team in the league is going to look at me and say the Rangers
didn't want me either. I go down to practice and my skate is thrown
in the river. I can't play right now. I have no hockey skates.
They're going to have to order some skates for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Supposedly, Neil threw my skate in the river he's so mad. He
had me under his nose and he decided he had other priorities.
Obviously, I wasn't a priority. Now they're mad they don't have me.
Obviously they're mad or they wouldn't be throwing my stuff out.
That sounds like something from grade school.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said he thought it vital that he hammer out a contract
with somebody. The Bruins offered one first.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life is hockey,'' he said. ``I love to play this game and I
didn't have a contract. I phoned (Rangers coach) John Muckler and I
totally respect John Muckler. I am thankful for him letting me come
in there, but I had the total risk at this thing. If it doesn't
work out in the New York, I'm finished. I still pressed the issue
to get something done but I wasn't a priority. But now all of a
sudden, they obviously wanted me if they're going to be throwing my
skate in the river and cutting my sticks in half.''
</P>
<P>
   When told about Murphy's recounting of the events, Smith denied
fooling around with anyone's equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I had thought that one up,'' said Smith. ``I think he's
giving me more credit than I deserve. The last time I checked, I'm
not the equipment manager. It's craziness to think I'd be getting
involved like that. I wouldn't even know which sticks are his.
Nothing surprises me in the career of Joe Murphy. That's bizarre,
the whole thing is ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he was planning to meet with Murphy to talk to him
about a contract that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was prepared to sit down with him and give him something and
say, `This is what I expect you to sign for,' and I was expecting
him to sit there and give me some feedback,'' said Smith.
</P>
<P>
   It never happened. Instead, the Bruins are hoping Murphy can
come close to the production he had last season with the San Jose
Sharks, when he potted 25 goals in the last year of a deal that
paid him $3.8 million. It was a contract originally given to him by
former St. Louis GM Mike Keenan.
</P>
<P>
   As a veteran defenseman with the Red Wings, Bruins assistant GM
Mike O'Connell roomed with Murphy back when Murphy was a rookie and
was the No. 1 pick overall by Detroit in 1986. O'Connell said he is
hoping Murphy can add some offensive punch to the Bruins' lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been looking for a forward for at least the last two
weeks,'' said O'Connell. ``We were looking at a centerman,
preferably, but the way Anson Carter has played center, it looks
like he could handle that.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy is likely to receive a hostile reaction when he faces the
players he thought would soon be his teammates. Murphy said the
Rangers just dragged their feet too long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I tried to track Neil down every day to try to get
something done and I was risking my career by being out there,''
said Murphy. ``If I got hurt, I'm not going to get a contract. My
objective was to get a contract and get back to the league. I've
been sitting out for awhile. No team had offered me a contract
until the Bruins did and that's what I was looking for. I'm very
grateful and I'm very excited. Boston was my favorite team growing
up.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Left wing Ken Belanger remains out of the lineup because of
postconcussion syndrome. Belanger was struck by Buffalo defenseman
Rhett Warrener Wednesday night and became ill later that night.
It's unknown how long he'll be sidelined . . . Right wing Rob
DiMaio missed his second straight game because of a badly bruised
left foot . . . Forward Peter Ferraro was sent back to Providence .
. . Goalie Byron Dafoe will get his fourth straight start Saturday.

 &HT;    Thousands gather at parade for Rebel
 &HT;    reburials
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ The furor over the Confederate flag swept
into this city where the Civil War began, stirring the rancorous
debate with the clashing symbols of heritage and hatred.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands watched Friday as a solemn funeral procession through
Charleston transferred the flag-draped coffins of 22 Confederate
war dead to Magnolia Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Under a sky as gray as the uniforms of more than 300 Civil War
re-enactors, the crowd sang ``Dixie'' and prayed over the bones,
packed in dirt and plastic inside small coffins. After the simple
wooden boxes were lowered into a long grave, rifles and cannons
boomed in salute, followed by the mournful trumpeting of taps over
the Cooper River.
</P>
<P>
   On behalf of the ancestors of Franklin Medaris, a Georgia
infantryman who died in Charleston in 1863, Brian Medaris accepted
the Confederate flag from atop his third great-uncle's coffin.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel like you know them,'' said Medaris, 39, a DeKalb
County paramedic who attended the funeral with 13 relatives. They
received red roses from women dressed in black funeral dresses and
veils.
</P>
<P>
   It was a formal, dignified reinterment of 22 soldiers and
sailors and a single child whose remains had been exhumed last
summer. Diggers recovered them from a long-abandoned mariners'
cemetery underneath The Citadel's football stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``These 23 souls have been brought home to rest,'' said the Rev.
C. Lynn Bailey, presiding over a ceremony in which the Confederate
flag represented an honorable ending.
</P>
<P>
   But among South Carolinians embroiled in the controversy of the
Rebel battle flag flying atop the state Capitol in Columbia, the
mood is turning surly, despite the governor's plea for compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jim Hodges told a business audience Friday in Charleston
that leaders of civil rights organizations and Confederate heritage
groups need to issue ``statements of mutual respect'' for each
other's views on the flag.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Hodges said, the flag controversy threatens ``to tear
this state apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in the last state to fly the flag atop its Capitol (though
Georgia and Mississippi still incorporate it in their state flags'
designs), civil rights groups label the banner as a racist reminder
of slavery; heritage groups view it as a symbol of their ancestors'
sacrifices.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting has intensified since the NAACP called for a
tourism boycott of South Carolina until the Legislature votes to
remove the flag from the Capitol. Concerned by the boycott, a
growing number of organizations, including the state Chamber of
Commerce, are endorsing the idea of moving the flag to ``a place of
honor'' on the Capitol grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Hodges, a first-term Democrat, is caught in the crossfire. He
tried Friday to mute blistering criticism of the solution he
offered two days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   If the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People agrees to suspend its tourism boycott, Hodges said, he would
muscle legislators to honor the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. with a
state holiday.
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP could always re-enact the boycott, the governor said,
if legislators balk on the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``One good-faith gesture deserves another,'' said Hodges,
explaining that a suspension of the boycott and the creation of a
King holiday would set the stage for resolving the flag dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Caught off guard by the proposal, civil rights leaders said they
were insulted Hodges would urge them to deal on an issue as
offensive to them as the flag.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Darrell Jackson of Columbia said Hodges blundered
badly by ensnaring the King holiday with the flag.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said lawmakers working on passage of the holiday were
close to getting the votes in the Republican-controlled House. He
blamed Hodges for jeopardizing the effort and had harsh words for
flag supporters in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the House votes down the King holiday, they can consider
that the Civil War within the borders of South Carolina has
begun,'' Jackson said. ``I predict as they lost before, they are
going to lose again.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Glenn McConnell, a Charleston Republican and
re-enactor who attended Friday's burial, said flag supporters would
support a King holiday along with a state holiday honoring
Confederate Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``One is not going to ride without the other,'' said McConnell,
labeling the boycott part of the NAACP's ``hate campaign against
ground,'' McConnell said.``The flag is not coming down from the
dome until the hate campaign stops.''
</P>
<P>
   In more conciliatory terms, Hodges said the boycott stands in
the way of a flag compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boycott has focused attention on the issue,'' he said,
``but now it is creating an obstacle to a resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Hodges also cautioned against the escalating war of words. ``The
more strident the rhetoric on both sides, the more shrill the
headlines in our news media, the less likely we are to make
progress,'' he said. ``We seem to be dividing into separate
camps.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's funeral procession drew a curious but respectful crowd.
It stretched along East Bay Street, from the stately homes near the
Battery waterfront to the low-income apartments underneath the
Cooper River bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred, including a group of black day care children,
filed in behind the re-enactors, a few of whom were on horseback,
but most marching in cadence with rifles.
</P>
<P>
   A raccoon tail hung from a bayonet. Soldiers tucked feathers in
their floppy hats. Children dressed in costume, little boys in gray
outfits, little girls in black hoop skirts.
</P>
<P>
   Few black people watched the procession or attended the burial.
``I wonder why they need a parade,'' said William Robinson, 41, a
black carpenter visiting his mother who lives in a government
housing facility. ``It seems they are exploiting the flag. They
want a big show of it.''
</P>
<P>
   At Magnolia Cemetery, re-enactor Bill Jackson of Eastman, Ga.,
said he was showing respect for the dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not here to sing `Dixie' and swing a flag,'' said
Jackson, owner of one of the 14 cannons which saluted the deceased.
</P>
<P>
   As city sanitation workers followed the procession, scooping up
horse droppings, the street returned to normal, crowded by tourists
and office workers.
</P>
<P>
   Retired schoolteacher Henry Simmons lingered afterwards at East
Bay and Queen streets. A 62-year-old black man, Simmons said he was
heartened that no protests or hate groups had tried to mar what he
thought was a respectful procession.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people need to do _ and it's more true of Charlestonians
_ is to put this issue of race behind them, and move on with their
lives,'' Simmons said. ``The year 2000 is almost upon us.''

MITCHELL ADJOURNS ULSTER TALKS, URGES PARTIES TO WEIGH CONSEQUENCES
OF FAILURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs to add missing word `government' in 3rd graf. No other
change.)  (jt) 
 By WARREN HOGE    
 c .1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ With his mission to salvage the
Northern Ireland peace settlement at a crisis point, George
Mitchell abruptly adjourned talks Friday morning and urged
negotiators to spend the weekend focusing on ``the gravity of what
is at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   The effort by Mitchell, the American mediator, was shaken
Thursday night by word that the Ulster Unionist leader David
Trimble was unable to gain the support of his party legislators in
a secret ballot on the compromise thrashed out with the rival Sinn
Fein party over the last 10 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Talks, which Mitchell said were at their ``final and most
critical phase,'' are to resume on Monday. Their purpose has been
to end a deadlock over the Ulster Unionists' refusal to admit Sinn
Fein to the Northern Ireland government established by the April
1998 peace accord before the Irish Republican Army starts
disarming. The IRA views disarmament as surrender, and Sinn Fein,
its political representative, argues that no such condition to take
part in government is in the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The complex formula that Trimble is using to try to break the
impasse involves a series of incremental reciprocal steps by Sinn
Fein and the Ulster Unionists rather than a single dramatic move.
Elements include an IRA statement condemning violence and pledging
not to return to its war against British rule, and the appointment
of a senior IRA official as a go-between to the international
disarmament panel headed by a retired Canadian general, John de
Chastelain.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan does not promise the actual turnover of weapons, an
insistent demand of the increasingly tough-minded Unionists, and
the absence of any such pledge cost it the required support
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   A Unionist spokesman, eager to free the party from the onus of
appearing to be a deal wrecker, said that no final decision had
been made. He explained that the Thursday night vote had merely
been a ``straw poll'' to help Trimble decide whether to put the
matter before the 900-member party council.
</P>
<P>
   The Mitchell review, conducted under a news blackout and on
occasion away from Belfast, has produced a comfort level among
lifelong enemies, establishing heretofore missing elements of trust
and mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
   But Trimble's willingness to deal directly with Sinn Fein has
not pleased many in his party, and whatever effort he makes this
weekend to push for acceptance of the rejected compromise could put
his leadership at risk.
</P>
<P>
   A call for his ouster came not unexpectedly from the Rev. Ian
Paisley, head of the hard-line Democratic Unionists and a fierce
opponent of the peace settlement. He said Trimble was promoting the
admission of ``gangsters and terrorists'' into government.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, challenged Trimble to gain
his party's backing. ``Success in this process requires that those
in political leadership fulfill their responsibilities and give
leadership,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, in a statement Friday morning, said that ``the past
few days have been very intense and accordingly I have asked the
parties to pause over the weekend and reflect on the magnitude of
the decisions they have to make.'' He acknowledged that his mission
had gone on far longer than he had planned, but that ``given the
gravity of what is at stake, it is appropriate to take the time
necessary to thoroughly and completely consider these important
matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, in South Africa for a
Commonwealth meeting, said the parties could not afford to let the
opportunity pass with agreement so near. ``We have never come this
far before,'' he said; ``we have never been this close. It is there
within our grasp.''

FLIGHT 990 PROBERS PUZZLED BY ENGINE CUTOFF DURING DIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ As it roared toward the ocean at nearly the
speed of sound, federal investigators said Friday, EgyptAir Flight
990's engines were abruptly cut off as cockpit warning alarms
wailed and passengers were rendered weightless by the force of the
dive.
</P>
<P>
   At a briefing here Friday, James E. Hall, chairman of the
National Transportation Safety Board, described what appeared to be
a deliberate, puzzling action, taken just after the ``controlled
descent'' that dropped the plane from 33,000 feet to about 19,000
feet within seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both left and right (engines) changed from `run' to `cut off,'
'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators still don't know why it happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, these data raise many questions in your minds,''
Hall said. ``I assure you, they raise questions in our minds, too.
We cannot at this time explain the circumstances that were
occurring on Flight 990 that resulted in the profile I just
described.''
</P>
<P>
   A commercial airline pilot who spoke on condition of anonymity
said it's not easy to shut the engines down. ``The last thing I
could imagine doing is that, even in an extremist situation,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot also speculated that, because of the lack of a
distress call from a member of the flight crew, the action taken
likely was deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   Still unsure whether the plane was doomed by man or machine,
crews off Nantucket resumed their search Friday for the jetliner's
cockpit voice recorder _ now deemed critical to understanding the
aircraft's fatal, final moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airplane was flying along with the nose perfectly level
and basically it then dove off a cliff,'' said John Hansman,
professor of aeronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't seen any obvious mechanical cause for that initial
dive,'' he said. ``It may be that it hasn't shown up yet. But we're
beginning to be able to discount the initial mechanical causes that
were suspected. As we have fewer and fewer mechanical causes, the
probability of human causes begins to rise.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, a top FBI official said the 200 agents assigned
to the crash are running down leads, but, so far, none has yielded
critical clues about what went wrong with the jetliner.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Valiquette, an FBI agent who serves as the bureau's
spokesman in New York, said federal investigators are examining
every aspect of each leg of the Boeing 767-300ER's flights between
Cairo, New York and Los Angeles in the days before the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you that nothing has arisen to which we're
attaching much significance with regard to the crew,'' Valiquette
said.
</P>
<P>
   EgyptAir Flight 990 crashed early Halloween morning some 60
miles south of Nantucket, about a half-hour after the Cairo-bound
jet took off from John F. Kennedy International Airport in New
York. All 217 passengers and crew were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The flight data recorder _ one of two ``black boxes'' _ was
retrieved from wreckage on the ocean floor and flown to Washington
for analysis earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary analysis of the data shows that eight seconds
after the autopilot disengaged amid an uneventful flight, the jet
pitched into a smooth, controlled dive that ultimately became steep
enough to parallel conditions of an astronaut training for
weightlessness.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said technicians have now retrieved all but five seconds of
data from the recorder, indicating that the device stopped working
during what radar data has shown happened next: That, after the
deep dive, the plane climbed again to about 24,000 feet before
beginning one last dive and breaking apart at about 16,700 feet
above the water.
</P>
<P>
   At about halfway through that descent, ``the speed of the
aircraft reaches .86 Mach and the captain's and the first officer's
master warning activate,'' Hall said. At sea level, Mach 1 is the
speed of sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``A master warning is one that indicates a potentially major
problem with the airplane that the flight crew must attend to
immediately,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Those warnings would activate when the plane reaches excessive
speed, cabin pressure drops, sensors detect a fire aboard, or the
plane's takeoff and landing configurations are incorrect.
</P>
<P>
   ``During this descent, the airplane reached a maximum nose-down
pitch angle of about 40 degrees,'' said Hall. An airplane on a
normal glide path toward landing has a nose-down pitch of 3 to 4
degrees. ``Then, the nose-down pitch angle started to lessen and
the (gravity) forces on the aircraft increased from about zero to
about 2.5,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, the data indicates, both of the aircraft's
engines were shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Experts have said the passengers would have felt extremely
disoriented as the plane plunged in the dark of night. Anyone not
wearing safety belts would likely have flown from their seats, then
slammed to the floor seconds later when the dive bottomed out.
</P>
<P>
   Hall would not speculate about why the crew may have taken that
action, or about any of the factors that downed the plane,
confining his comments to the dry data culled from the recorder.
</P>
<P>
   But because the device indicates that the jet was in a
controlled descent _ meaning the flight crew was controlling the
plane _ investigators are more acutely concerned that a terrorist
or a criminal, and not a mechanical malfunction, was responsible
for the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, even the NTSB was surprised at that finding,''
Valiquette said of the flight recorder's readings. ``And so were
we. It does raise the specter a little bit more intensely that
maybe there was a criminal act or a terrorist act involved here.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're still a long way from making a determination that
this was a criminal act,'' he said. ``A controlled descent took
everyone by surprise. And it raises more questions than we had.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Crawley, the head of MIT's aeronautics and astronautics
department, said while passengers would feel weightless during a
plunge like that, they would not have lost consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we learned is that this was an intentional maneuver,''
Crawley said. ``It's all consistent with the pilot doing this. This
isn't the direct result of the flight control system. These are all
things that a pilot would sit there and do. The missing piece is:
Why would he do this?''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI's Lewis Schiliro told ABC News that officials have
received several phone calls claiming responsibility for downing
the airplane. Each is being investigated, he said, but noted that
``at this point, none of (them), we're determining to be
credible.''

   As investigators continue to pore over electronic data in
Washington, the search resumed Friday for the cockpit voice
recorder as Navy vessels and a private ship sent submersible robots
to help locate it. They were hoping to work through the weekend
before weather conditions worsen Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our intentions are to put in maxiumum effort,'' said Navy Rear
Admiral William G. Sutton. ``(The USS) Grapple is anchored over the
pingers and we'll keep (conducting robot) operations there to look
for the cockpit voice recorder.''

NEWS ANALYSIS: NEW CONCERNS ABOUT FIRST LADY'S CAMPAIGN
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK _ Among many Democrats Friday , the question was not
why Hillary Rodham Clinton had sat silently in Ramallah as the wife
of Yasser Arafat seemingly accused Israelis of poisoning
Palestinian women and children. The question was why Mrs. Clinton
had agreed to go to the West Bank in the first place _ and than why
it took her 12 hours to offer even a tentative response to Suha
Arafat's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, when Mrs. Clinton approved television advertisements
to promote her expected Senate campaign earlier this week, the
question was not over the wisdom of such an early expenditure of
campaign funds. It was instead over the fact that it was financed
with the same kind of unregulated, backdoor campaign contributions
that had clouded President Clinton's campaign in 1996, inviting
attacks by her likely opponent, New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, and critical comment by newspaper editorials.
</P>
<P>
   These two seemingly unrelated incidents might have been
separated by three days and 5,000 miles. But taken together, they
have stirred a new round of concern among many Democrats about the
state of Mrs. Clinton's exploratory campaign and the skills of this
first-time candidate. The two events have dispirited some of her
closest associates and emboldened Giuliani in what his advisers
describe as a deliberate attempt to establish an early dominance in
the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way this developed is troubling, and this needs to be
resolved,'' said one of Mrs. Clinton's advisers, who, like most of
her associates, did not want to be identified in discussing what
one described as the low point of her fledgling campaign.
``Everything she does will be viewed through the Senate lens.
There's no escaping it.''
</P>
<P>
   The events this week on the West Bank crystallized what a
growing number of Democrats has suspected: Mrs. Clinton's
underlying problem is her continuing effort to serve both as the
nation's first lady and as the likely Democratic candidate for U.S.
Senate in New York.
</P>
<P>
   She went to the Middle East at the invitation of Leah Rabin to
discuss the peace process at the center in Tel Aviv named after the
slain prime minister, Yitzak Rabin. In accepting the invitation,
Mrs. Clinton put aside the concerns of some advisers aware of the
perils that inevitably rise when New York and Israeli politics
meet.
</P>
<P>
   The day she left, Mrs. Clinton pointedly described this as an
official trip, and said she did not want it viewed in the context
of a Senate race. She instructed her political staff to remain at
home, traveling instead with a contingent from the White House and
State Department.
</P>
<P>
   But the difficulty in drawing such distinctions became extremely
clear this week, as television and news wires brought home her
Mideast events and her dismayed political aides closely followed
the unfolding trouble. ``If you were planning a campaign trip, this
is not the kind of campaign trip you would have planned,'' said
Howard Wolfson, the campaign press secretary, speaking from Mrs.
Clinton's headquarters in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's aides said that had he found himself in a similar
position, the mayor might have stormed off, or denounced Mrs.
Arafat on the spot for making a statement that was sure to give
rise to protest among American Jews. Considering the fact that
Giuliani evicted Arafat from Lincoln Center in 1995, there seems
little reason to doubt that claim.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton and her aides offered a number of reasons for why
she, by contrast, said nothing about the remarks until she arrived
in Amman 12 hours later. She was, first off, concerned about taking
any step that might jeopardize the peace talks. The on-the-spot
translation she received was imprecise, said Marsha Berry, Mrs.
Clinton's White house press secretary, and she wanted to wait until
she got a formal written transcript before she actually offered a
response.
</P>
<P>
   And even the response exposed the dual, and dueling, roles that
she and her staffs are playing. Its delayed timing reflected the
cautious White House staff, which is often at odds with her more
aggressive, if clearly frustrated, campaign organization.
</P>
<P>
   And the sluggishness stirred concern among Democrats following
Mrs. Clinton's travels. ``If something like this happens, the first
thing you learn is fix it in the same news cycle,'' said one New
York Democratic strategist not associated with Mrs. Clinton's
campaign. ``Now you can't catch up. It's impossible to catch up.''
</P>
<P>
   A growing worry of some Democrats goes beyond her conflicting
roles to what they see as deficiencies in both her exploratory
campaign and her political skills. She has yet to hire anything
beyond a skeletal campaign staff, and what she has is scattered
between New York and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Ickes, her senior political adviser, serves as Mrs.
Clinton de facto campaign manager. But while Ickes is a native New
Yorker and well versed in city and state politics, he is based in
Washington, where he works as a private lobbyist. Until Mrs.
Clinton hires a campaign manager, there is no single force guarding
against missteps like this week's commercials and wayward trip.
</P>
<P>
   Her advisers insist that the campaign will gel once she formally
announces, and forges a separate political identity from the White
House. ``When she becomes a full candidate instead of being the
concept of the candidate, she's really going to be able to drive
her issues and her message in a way that she can't now,'' said the
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   But that quick palliative may not occur anytime soon. Before
Mrs. Clinton left for the Middle East, she and her advisers, after
some discussion, decided to push off her official announcement, yet
again, this time from January to February. Mrs. Clinton was said to
believe that January is still too early to begin officially
presenting herself as a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   From Amman Friday night, Ms. Berry, the first lady's White House
press secretary, said that Mrs. Clinton and her contingent had
monitored the tumble of events with an air of resignation. ``This
is a new process, really,'' Ms. Berry said. ``We're still working
out how to work together. We've done a pretty good job and we'll
continue to improve at it.''

NIXON WANTED TO REFUSE A PARDON AND FIGHT CHARGES, LAWYER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Herbert Miller, Richard Nixon's criminal defense
lawyer, said Friday that the former president had at first spurned
a pardon from President Ford in 1974, saying he wanted to fight any
charges that might be brought against him by the Watergate special
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, speaking publicly for the first time about the pardon at
a forum held here at Duquesne University Law School, said that in
late August 1974 Nixon's ``initial reaction was that he did not
want a pardon.'' He said the ex-president, a proud man, ``felt that
if he had done something wrong, let him be indicted and go to
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   The Washington lawyer, who has represented Nixon and his heirs
for 25 years in their efforts to assert ownership of the Nixon
White House tapes and to keep them from being made public, said he
persuaded Nixon that there was no possibility that he could get a
fair trial after the publicity about the case, making it likely
that the issue would drag on for years. After those discussions, he
said, Nixon agreed to take a pardon, even with its implications of
guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed after the forum, Miller said he could not reconcile
the reluctance he saw in Nixon with efforts by White House aides _
made with Nixon's knowledge _ to raise the idea of a pardon with
Ford, then the vice president, before Nixon's resignation on Aug.
9, 1974. ``I don't know anything about that,'' said Miller, who was
retained by Nixon after his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Woodward's book ``Shadow'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster), citing but
not directly quoting an interview with Miller, said: ``Nixon was
opposed to accepting the pardon. He felt it would imply some kind
of guilt.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller also said Friday that Leon Jaworski, the Watergate
special prosecutor, had told him that he agreed with Miller that
public opinion in Washington made a fair trial impossible without a
long delay. Miller said he had met with Jaworski at the Jefferson
Hotel to sound him out about a pardon, because he feared that one
would not be issued if the prosecutor was against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He indicated he would not challenge a pardon and was in favor
of it,'' Miller said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Jaworski died in 1982 and never acknowledged favoring a pardon.
James Doyle, who was his press spokesman in 1974, said Friday night
that while he had no direct knowledge, he doubted that Jaworski
would have stated his support of a pardon to Nixon's lawyer. ``Leon
was a poker player, and he kept his cards close to his vest,''
Doyle said.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that when the pardon was issued, Jaworski told him,
``I'm relieved.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said that he had been authorized by Julie Nixon
Eisenhower, the late president's daughter, to discuss the pardon on
Friday. But when a reporter at a news conference earlier asked if
Nixon had ever acknowledged his guilt in Watergate to him, Miller
demurred. He indicated that attorney-client privilege might bar a
direct answer, saying, ``If he ever said it to his attorney, the
attorney would not be able to discuss it.'' Nixon died in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Gormley, the law professor who organized Friday's forum,
recounted a conversation with Ronald Ziegler, Nixon's press
secretary, who had been scheduled to take part in the forum but did
not because of a recent injury.
</P>
<P>
   He said Ziegler had told him that after the ex-president had
agreed to accept a pardon, he became greatly agitated over his fear
that Ford would not issue one. Miller said Ziegler had told him the
same thing.
</P>
<P>
   All the participants in the forum insisted that there had been
no ``deal'' to issue a pardon before Nixon's resignation. Besides
Miller, the others who said so included Jerald ter Horst, Ford's
press secretary, who resigned in protest over the pardon; Benton
Becker, the White House lawyer who negotiated the terms of Nixon's
statement accepting the pardon, and Robert Hartmann, Ford's adviser
and chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Hartmann said the ``problem that created the specter of a deal
was that Ford was inarticulate.'' He said ``the more Ford tried to
explain what he meant the worse it got.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Ford had told a news conference on Aug. 28, 1974,
that he would make no commitment on the pardon issue ``until the
legal process has been undertaken'' and ``until it gets to me.''
That led people to believe that he planned to wait at least until
an indictment had been handed up, probably for participation in the
Watergate coverup _ before considering a pardon.
</P>
<P>
   All the participants also agreed that Ford issued the pardon
because he found that questions about Nixon were overwhelming his
time and getting in the way of efforts to deal with other national
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The former president's son, Steve Ford, said that his father
knew that the pardon ``was a decision that cost him any further
political career.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if that was how Ford felt when he issued it, he lost very
narrowly to Jimmy Carter in 1976.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 14)  
 (af)  
 By CAROLE GOULD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a fund manager, Gordon Grender doesn't seem to mind doing
things that might be regarded as a little odd. For example, he runs
a United States stock fund, the $58.5 million GAMerica Capital
fund, from an office overlooking Westminster Cathedral in London.
</P>
<P>
   The geography gives him an edge, he said. ``I can read The Wall
Street Journal and The New York Times on the Web and check
Bloomberg before anybody in New York gets up,'' he said in an
English accent.
</P>
<P>
   Grender, who has been managing American money from across the
Atlantic since 1974, has built an enviable record. GAMerica Capital
returned 27.2 percent a year, on average, for the three years
through Nov. 5, compared with 10.1 percent for its peer group of
small blend funds, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago
financial publisher, and 33.8 percent for the Russell 2000 index of
small-capitalization stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Grender, 55, searches the markets for value among American
companies of all sizes, although the fund is now heavily weighted
in small-capitalization stocks _ the category where he is finding
the best bargains. He looks for businesses with annual earnings
growth of 15 percent or more and is adamant about not overpaying;
he aims to pay less than the market's price-to-earnings multiple,
currently 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't bring myself to buy glamour stocks with
capitalizations in the billions but revenues in the millions,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if a stock performs strongly ``I tend to run with it,''
he said, holding on as it rises in price. The turnover rate for his
fund, which holds just 40 to 50 stocks, averages 29 percent, versus
96 percent for a typical fund. But its class A shares carry a 5
percent front-end load and an expense ratio of 2.46 percent, versus
1.49 percent for its average peer.
</P>
<P>
   Grender reads many American business publications and gathers
valuable information on the road, he said, attending investment
conferences and visiting companies. He tours the United States at
least four times a year; each trip lasts at least two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many other managers, he ignores quarterly earnings
forecasts, which he calls a ``futile exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Analysts tend to report what management tells them,'' he said.
``They don't do their own independent work.''
</P>
<P>
   In looking at a company, Grender wants to see sales growth of at
least 5 percent a year above inflation, and relatively substantial
free cash flow, although the amount depends on the type of
business.
</P>
<P>
   He is particularly drawn to companies with very depressed stock
prices _ those that are down 25 percent to 50 percent from their
most recent highs. Here, he shows his contrarian streak: ``I don't
worry about companies whose share prices take big falls when they
report disappointing earnings if I think the fundamental story is
sound.''
</P>
<P>
   Another plus, he said, is inside ownership. ``I want top
management to own shares in the company, not just stock options,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He is not afraid to carry cash _ the fund's cash position grew
to 50 percent by October, as new money flowed in. In the last few
weeks, he has reduced it to about 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been nervous about the level of the stock market,'' he
said. ``But I've been buying lately because so many stocks have
been taking such big falls.''
</P>
<P>
   Grender owns stock in Power-One, a company in Camarilla, Calif.,
that makes power supply equipment for commercial electronic devices
like CAT scanners. He bought more shares after a conference call in
October in which company management expressed caution about meeting
fourth-quarter earnings estimates, driving down the price from over
$30 a share to $15. He paid $20. The company, he said, is ``a
lower-risk way to play the growth in electronics.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund initially bought Power-One stock in October 1998 at $6
a share. Earnings have grown about 25 percent a year since the
company went public in 1997, helped by acquisitions. Insiders own
about 15 percent of the shares, which closed on Friday at $19.625,
or 29.5 times consensus earnings estimates of 66.5 cents a share
for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Another choice is Policy Management Systems of Blythewood, S.C.,
which makes software used by insurers. Grender bought shares in
October for $21, down from $55 in February, after the company said
it would miss its third-quarter earnings forecasts because of
delays caused by Year 2000 computer issues and other problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``But because customers tend to rely on them heavily,'' Grender
said, ``the fact that their earnings are poor and their stock price
is down doesn't mean that their business will go away.''
</P>
<P>
   He estimates three-year earnings growth of 15 percent to 20
percent a year, on average. And he thinks sales should grow above
10 percent a year over that time. Management owns just under 1
percent of shares, but that is enough for Grender because of the
company's large market capitalization. The stock now trades at
$20.875, or 13.9 times 1999 consensus earnings estimates of $1.51 a
share.
</P>
<P>
   In September, he paid $47 a share for Sprint, shortly before the
company announced its merger deal with MCI WorldCom. The stock
price had fallen to the mid-$40s, from $55 in June, because of
worries about increased competition from other long-distance
carriers.
</P>
<P>
   He jumped in, he said, ``because I thought the company was a
likely acquisition target as the industry consolidated.'' Moreover,
he said, it was ``reasonably priced'' relative to other companies
in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Grender is bullish on the merger, and thinks the combined
company will grow 30 percent a year, on average, over three years.

EYGPTAIR FLIGHT DATA RAISES MORE QUESTIONS THAN IT ANSWERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By C.J. CHIVERS with MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT NAVAL STATION, R.I. _ The EgyptAir flight that crashed
on Oct. 31 went into an extreme dive, making the passengers
weightless and pitching the nose down at a 40-degree angle, before
the nose pulled back up and subjected the plane and its passengers
to two and a half times the normal force of gravity, the chairman
of the National Transportation Safety Board said Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said many of the details released Friday might reflect
an airplane that was in an emergency, but still under control. But
the chairman, James E. Hall, said that the information from the
flight data recorder also showed that both engines had been
switched off from the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots experienced with the Boeing 767, the type of plane that
crashed, said they could not understand why the engines had been
turned off, with the information now in hand.
</P>
<P>
   Hall also said that the elevators, the adjustable surfaces on
the horizontal tail that are used to raise or lower the nose, moved
to uneven positions. It is not possible for the crew to command
such a movement on the 767, according to pilots, and the fact that
the elevators moved out of unison indicates a major malfunction.
But it was not clear from the information released so far whether
this was a cause of the accident or a malfunction along the way.
</P>
<P>
   The crash, about 60 miles from Nantucket, Mass., killed all 217
people on board. Other than a small quantity of debris and human
remains, searchers have not recovered anything except one of the
two ``black boxes,'' the flight data recorder, which they are still
analyzing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, these data raise many questions,'' Hall said. ``I
can assure you they have raised questions in the minds of the NTSB
and the investigators. We cannot at this time explain the
circumstances that were occurring on Flight 990 that resulted in
the flight profile I have just described, and we will not attempt
to speculate about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, the second ``black box,'' the cockpit voice
recorder, might explain the circumstances. The Navy believes it has
located that device on the sea floor, within a pile of wreckage
from the plane, but a robot submarine was still trying to retrieve
it Friday.
</P>
<P>
   For law enforcement authorities, Friday's information raised
questions that deepened the mystery of EgyptAir even as it yielded
few clues to guide the inquiry into whether anyone might
intentionally have interfered with the flight or tried to bring
down the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that in the course of their investigation
they had examined the recent activities, background, medical
history and emotional stability of the crew members and passengers.
But so far, the officials said, those inquiries had not provided
useful information.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the officials said that while the FBI inquiry was far
from over, investigators were faced with dwindling leads and,
increasingly frustrated over their inability to help explain the
crash, were anxiously awaiting recovery of the cockpit voice
recorder.

 NEWPORT NAVAL STATION, R.I.: voice recorder.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the plunge on Oct. 31, conditions on the plane, which was
about half an hour out of Kennedy International Airport on a flight
to Cairo, Egypt, would have been far different from a normal
flight.
</P>
<P>
   In everyday operations, the 767 angles up no more than 20
degrees and down no more than about 5; U.S. airlines define a
nose-down altitude of more than 10 degrees as an ``upset.''
</P>
<P>
   And in ordinary flight, passengers seldom feel the force of
gravity at less than .9 G or more than 1.1 G. One G is the force of
gravity for a person standing on the ground; anything higher is the
extra weight a person feels going up in a fast elevator, and
anything lower is what someone feels in an elevator going down.
</P>
<P>
   At 2.5 G's, ``you would feel the weight of your face,'' said one
long-time 767 pilot.
</P>
<P>
   The 767 is certified to operate at up to 2.5 G's of positive
force and 1 G of negative force, so it could survive the transition
from a steep dive to a climb without damage if the force did not
exceed 2.5 G's. In fact, damage, in the form of rivets popping and
the metal skeleton bending, is not supposed to set in at fewer than
3.75 G's, according to Boeing documents.
</P>
<P>
   But those limits assume that the plane is not exceeding its
speed limit, and Hall hinted Friday that Flight 990 may have been
exceeding that limit, 86 percent of the speed of sound, during its
descent.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe that the plane approached the speed of
sound, which varies according to the density of air but is about
700 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said that the flight data recorder had noted that a master
alarm went off, which could have been triggered by several factors,
including flying too fast. Another is cabin depressurization.
</P>
<P>
   The alarm ``indicates a potentially major problem with the
airplane that the flight crew must attend to immediately,'' he
said. The information in hand does not make clear when the crew
lost control of the airplane.
</P>
<P>
   In an emergency descent, which might be needed because of cabin
depressurization or other causes, one standard technique is to turn
off the autopilot and slow down the engines, push the nose down and
hold the speed at the ``red line.'' If the plane is flying faster,
the pilot would pull the nose up; when it goes slower, he would
push it down again.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of this flight appear to follow that pattern. The flight
data recorder indicates that the autopilot disconnected, but not
whether it turned itself off or was turned off by the crew. The
nose was lowered. And the engines were slowed down.
</P>
<P>
   But turning off the engines does not fit in, except perhaps as a
desperate way to slow down, pilots said. ``There are reasons why
you would shut down an engine, but you wouldn't shut down both
engines,'' said one pilot. The reasons include an engine fire, an
engine that had to be re-started because the flame inside went out
or a runaway engine that could not be slowed down.
</P>
<P>
   The flight data recorder is supposed to note if there were
engine fires, and there was no mention of such a finding at the
briefing Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Weather and technical problems have bedeviled salvagers for two
weeks, frustrating the Navy's search for the cockpit voice recorder
through the plane's fragments in 240 to 270 feet of water.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say the picture would be a lot clearer if only
they had the cockpit voice recorder. On Friday the weather was
cooperative; seas were light and winds gentle. But Magnum, a robot
deployed from the submarine support vessel Carolyn Chouest needed
repairs and spent much of the day on deck.
</P>
<P>
   By nightfall, however, the salvage ship Grapple was anchored
over one of the audio beacons that is believed to be attached to
the missing recorder, and Deep Drone, another robot, was on the
bottom searching for it. Magnum had been repaired and was surveying
waters nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Rear Adm. William G. Sutton, who commands the salvage effort,
said the ships and their crews would take advantage of the fair
seas and work through the weekend. ``We are projected to have this
good weather to Sunday afternoon,'' Sutton said. By Sunday evening,
the weather is supposed to turn foul again.

ROCKET ATTACK ON U.S. AND U.N. OFFICES IN PAKISTAN FAILS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan _ Several rockets were fired at American
diplomatic and U.N. buildings here Friday in an apparently
coordinated attack, but they missed their targets. One person was
reported injured.
</P>
<P>
   The attack came two days before U.N. economic sanctions are to
take effect against neighboring Afghanistan if its governing
Taliban movement does not turn over Osama bin Laden, the Saudi whom
the United States accuses of masterminding the bombings of the
American Embassies in Tanzania and Kenya in 1998. Those blasts
killed 224 people.
</P>
<P>
   No one claimed responsibility for Friday's rocket launchings,
but military and political officials here suspected a link to the
sanctions. The Taliban denied that it was to blame. The Islamabad
police said no arrests were made by evening.
</P>
<P>
   The attackers fixed double-barreled rocket launchers to three
parked vehicles, fled and then set the weapons off almost
simultaneously using a timed or remote mechanism, Pakistani
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The rockets were aimed at buildings in the heart of Islamabad:
the American Embassy, a U.S.-run library and cultural office called
the American Center and a 17-story office tower housing several
U.N. agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The injured person was a Pakistani guard at the American Center.
The only reported damage apart from the attackers' own charred
vehicles was broken glass at the American Center and a few burned
trees and shrubs.
</P>
<P>
   Security was heightened around the embassy here and at the U.S.
Consulate in Peshawar, a city close to the Afghanistan border and
the home of about a million Afghan refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan's military seized power in a popular, bloodless coup, a
month ago, a period in which this turbulent country of 130 million
had been unusually peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   Large crowds milled around the blast sites, but otherwise there
was no apparent unease on the streets of the sedate capital. Friday
prayers went on as usual just an hour and a half after the
explosions.
</P>
<P>
   But tension was palpable outside the consulate in Peshawar,
where guards questioned or searched some passers-by, including a
few riding bicycles.
</P>
<P>
   The attackers seemed to have had little trouble penetrating
Islamabad's center, where most government buildings and foreign
embassies are situated.
</P>
<P>
   The attackers had bolted the rocket launchers to the floors of
the three vehicles. The launchers, tubes about four feet long and
five inches in diameter, appeared to have been crudely rigged. They
fired mortar-type projectiles.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicles were a white jeep parked beside the capital's main
parkway about 200 yards from the office tower, which houses U.N.
drug enforcement and other agencies; a Honda Civic in a parking lot
next to the American Center, which is also on the wide parkway; and
another jeep, bearing a U.N. license plate, left in a large dirt
field behind the American Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   The police said they found four of the mortar shells, all far
from their intended targets. One was outside the American Center
compound, a second had struck a U.N. vehicle, a third had struck a
Pakistan government building near the American Embassy, and the
fourth was in the nearby hills. All were taken to a police lab for
inspection.
</P>
<P>
   The blasts set the vehicles ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   The police said the attackers did not appear expert. The
vehicles that were supposed to anchor the launchers were thrown
several feet by the force of the launchings, said a supervisor with
the city's anti-terrorism squad.
</P>
<P>
   Security officials immediately considered a link to the
sanctions that are to be imposed against the Taliban on Sunday if
bin Laden and one of his chief aides are not apprehended. Under the
resolution approved last month by the Security Council, the
Taliban's economic assets abroad are to be frozen, and
international flights by the national airline, Ariana, curtailed.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban has strongly urged the United Nations not to enact
the sanctions but has repeatedly refused to hand over bin Laden. He
has reportedly told the Taliban that he is willing to leave as long
as no one discloses his destination, but the movement's leaders are
said to have refused his offer.
</P>
<P>
   The list of possible culprits is not short. Apart from the
Taliban itself, Pakistan is home to several well-armed paramilitary
groups sympathetic to the Taliban and hostile to the United States,
in addition to thousands of Pakistani religious militants who over
the years have trained side by side with Taliban members in Islamic
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, issued a statement
condemning the attacks, saying they had been aimed at straining the
Taliban's relations with Pakistan, the United States and the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   In an appeal for Washington and the United Nations to refrain
from quick judgment, Omar said he had investigated and then
absolved the United States of involvement in a truck bomb explosion
on Aug. 24 outside his home in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar
that killed 10 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Islam such acts are abhorred,'' he said, ``since these are
not to the benefit of anyone but create instability in the region,
which leads to the killing of innocent people. The Islamic Emirate
of Afghanistan has always condemned terrorism and continues to do
so.''
</P>
<P>
   The threatened sanctions have already provoked protests in
Afghanistan, where the economy has been devastated by two decades
of war.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, thousands of Afghan protesters threw stones at a
U.N. building in Kandahar.

 &HT;    Lockheed stock price outlook poor
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Lockheed Martin shareholders may be facing a cruel
dilemma: whether to cut their already considerable losses by
selling, or hang on in hopes that an expected upturn in defense
spending will rescue the troubled company.
</P>
<P>
   On one side are analysts who say the rumored sale of certain
assets would be the best news shareholders could expect from the
nation's biggest defense contractor, which has suffered from
problems all year.
</P>
<P>
   The company shocked the market on Oct. 29 by slashing its
earnings projection for 2000 in half and announcing the resignation
of its president, Peter Teets. The company's shares fell almost 13
percent.
</P>
<P>
   This offers little hope that investors can expect much of a
rally in share prices any time soon, some analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think the company's shares will do much either way
until their earnings are growing again, but they have been
shrinking instead of growing,'' said analyst Paul N. Nisbet of JSA
Research in Newport, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   On a steadily downward trajectory since early last year,
Lockheed Martin's shares closed on Friday at $19, less than half
their 52-week high of $54.62 1/2 on Nov. 23, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, however, some analysts argue that defense
spending is expected to rise significantly for the first time since
the end of the Cold War, with Pentagon purchases rising to as much
as $75 billion by 2005 from $44 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   And with Lockheed Martin's shares having fallen so far, some
analysts make a case that it has become a value stock with nowhere
to go but up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lockheed Martin shares are definitely in bargain territory,''
said John Dorfman, president of Dorfman Investments in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   In a Bloomberg News report, Dorfman noted the rise in defense
procurements during the fiscal year that ended in September, the
first in 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a bipartisan consensus that defense spending has been
cut too much,'' Dorfman said. ``This bodes well for Lockheed
Martin, the largest U.S. defense contractor.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, this is probably a matter for speculation. The
company has not confirmed published reports that it is considering
the sale, or closing, of some core operations.
</P>
<P>
   The company's problems are not new and, given the long-term
nature of aerospace and defense projects generally, the situation
isn't likely to change fundamentally any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Near term, the widely mixed opinions of 15 Wall Street analysts
who follow Lockheed Martin shares provides perhaps the best clue to
the company's investment landscape _ seven have ``hold'' ratings on
the stock, two have ``sells,'' but six have ``buy'' ratings.

ALFRED GWYNNE VANDERBILT, 87, HORSEMAN FROM AN ARISTOCRATIC
FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt, the elegant symbol of the sportsman in
high society when he was the impresario of horse racing and the
pillar of one of the most aristocratic families in America, died
Friday at his home in Mill Neck, N.Y. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in London and educated at St. Paul's School and
Yale, and his grandfather, Cornelius Vanderbilt II, was reputed to
be the world's richest man. His mother, Margaret Emerson, came from
Bromo-Seltzer wealth, and his father, Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt,
died after giving his life jacket to a woman on the Lusitania when
the ship was sunk by a German submarine in the Atlantic in 1915.
</P>
<P>
   Yet surrounded by family history, wealth and opportunity, Alfred
Gwynne Vanderbilt took a direct route to the racetrack and spent
his life breeding, owning and racing his horses.
</P>
<P>
   Even at 80, tall and richly groomed, he remained the very model
of the racing blueblood. He ran Pimlico and Belmont Park while in
his 20s; he pioneered the use of the starting gate and the photo
finish; he skippered a PT boat in the Navy; and he shot lions with
Ernest Hemingway in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But his shining moments came through the brilliance of one gray
colt, Native Dancer, who won 21 of his 22 races and lost the other
one, the 1953 Kentucky Derby, by the length of his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the first time I went to the races at Pimlico at the age
of 9,'' Vanderbilt once said, ``I have had this wonderful feeling
about racing. I don't go to the races because I just love horses.
It's like the person who goes to the circus and falls in love with
the whole show, not just the elephants.''
</P>
<P>
   He stayed in love with the whole show for the rest of his life,
amusing people by inventing witty and salty names for his horses
and appearing constantly on the backstretch at the Belmont and
Aqueduct racetracks. Rain or shine, winter or summer, he was there,
a well-dressed and graceful man in his 80s with failing eyesight
and an informal manner. He would walk through the staff offices for
morning conversations and eventually wind up in his box for several
races before being driven home again to Mill Neck on the North
Shore of Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father went to the racetrack today,'' his son Alfred said
Friday. ``He came back and was changing clothes when his secretary
said he keeled over.''
</P>
<P>
   He was the legendary link to the days when racing was a way of
life. It became his way of life when he turned 21 and his mother
gave him the 600-acre Sagamore farm in Maryland as a gift. For the
next 40 years he bred horses there, his line of stars beginning
with Discovery, who won six stakes in 1934, won 27 of his 63 races
over all and later sired 25 horses who won stakes. And racing was
still his passion when he was 84 and his 2-year-old colt Traitor
came out of nowhere to win the Belmont Futurity.
</P>
<P>
   In the six decades in between, Vanderbilt made a landmark impact
on horse racing.
</P>
<P>
   He became president of Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore in 1932
when he was 20, and he revived interest in the Preakness, the
second race in the Triple Crown series. He again became president
of Pimlico in 1938, and promptly brought together Seabiscuit and
War Admiral for the inaugural running of the Pimlico Special. He
was the leading money-winning owner in America in 1935 and 1953. He
was president of the Westchester Racing Association, which operated
Belmont Park before the New York Racing Association was
incorporated in 1955, and for four years starting in 1971 served as
chairman of the board of N.Y.R.A. and the chief executive of the
Belmont, Aqueduct and Saratoga racetracks.
</P>
<P>
   He also became a member of the Jockey Club in 1935, and four
times he was voted by New York's turf writers as ``the man who did
the most for racing.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   But his greatest achievement in racing was undoubtedly a horse:
Native Dancer. He was sired by Polynesian and foaled by the mare
Geisha, a daughter of Discovery, leading Vanderbilt to postulate
this formula for success in breeding racers: ``Breed something to a
Discovery mare.'' And Native Dancer, whose name was one of the
lineage puns for which Vanderbilt was famous, was the prime
example. He reigned as the champion 2-year-old colt in 1952,
champion 3-year-old colt in 1953 and Horse of the Year in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1953 Kentucky Derby, now considered one of the dramatic
upsets in racing history, Native Dancer was bumped at the first
turn, lost several lengths, made a gallant stretch drive under Eric
Guerin and was beaten by a head by Cain Hoy Stable's Dark Star. He
returned to win the Preakness and Belmont Stakes and six other
stakes that year, ended his career with earnings of $785,240,
scored 17 of his 21 victories in stakes races and retired with that
one galling loss.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Discovery and Native Dancer, other national
champions who carried the cerise-and-white Vanderbilt silks were
Next Move, champion 3-year-old filly in 1950, and Bed o'Roses,
champion 2-year-old filly in 1949 and champion handicap mare in
1951.
</P>
<P>
   When generations of Vanderbilts gathered in New York in 1994 to
celebrate the 200th anniversary of the birth of Commodore Cornelius
Vanderbilt, great-great-grandfather of Alfred Vanderbilt, he had
already passed his 80th birthday but was still a calm, cool,
handsome man surrounded by two centuries of history and by his
children from three marriages: Wendy, Heidi, Alfred Jr., Victoria
and Michael. Another son, Nicholas Harvey Vanderbilt, died in a
climbing accident in Canada in 1984; his other children survive
him, as do five grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   His courtships and marriages were regular staples of the
newspaper society pages in those days, when the terms ``playboy''
and ``sportsman'' were in vogue. In 1938, when he was 25, he
married Manuela Hudson. In 1946, when he was 32, he married Jeanne
Murray of Southampton. And in 1957, at 44, he married Jean Harvey,
heiress to the Harvey restaurant chain and Cudahy meat-packing
empire. The marriages ended in divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt was among the last of his generation of
Vanderbilts _ great-great-grandchildren of Commodore Cornelius
Vanderbilt (1794-1877), who founded the Vanderbilt fortune with
investments in real estate and transportation and whose descendants
have had a large influence on American society ever since. The
announcement of his birth on Sept. 22, 1912, was printed in the
center of The New York Times' front page the next day.
</P>
<P>
   One aunt, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney (1875-1942), was an artist
and a founder of the Museum of Modern Art; his uncles included
Cornelius Vanderbilt III (1873-1942), who was a brigadier general.
Another aunt, Gladys Moore Vanderbilt (1886-1965), inherited the
Breakers, the famous family summer cottage in Newport; her
daughter, Countess Szapary, died in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   His older half-brother, William Henry Vanderbilt III
(1901-1981), was governor of Rhode Island from 1983 to 1940. His
younger brother George Washington Vanderbilt III (1914-1961) was a
yachtsman and explorer.
</P>
<P>
   Another prominent member of his generation, his first cousin
Gloria Vanderbilt (born in 1924), is still living; the daughter of
another uncle, Reginald Claypool Vanderbilt (1880-1925), she was
the object of a furious custody battle when she was a child; as an
adult she became most famous as a clothing designer.
</P>
<P>
   Though Alfred Vanderbilt enjoyed both the life and the
reputation of a millionaire playboy, he had wide-ranging artistic
interests, initially acquired through his mother's circle of
artistic and theatrical friends; his own intimate friends included
George Abbott, Hal Prince and Fred Astaire.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt was once asked what his most exciting personal moment
in racing had been, and he replied: ``I guess it was the last race
I won.''
</P>
<P>
   But his zest for thoroughbred racing became diluted by his
distress at the direction the sport was taking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where is racing today?'' he reflected as tracks began to lose
significant attendance in the 1990s. ``Racing's going downhill,
that's where it is today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Horse racing once was a contest, a sport. The only thing
that's important now is the betting, the revenue. They even open
the track for betting now when the horses are running someplace
else. If they keep doing that, they'll skip the horses entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main reason for smaller crowds today is off-track betting.
You also have casino gambling, and you create multiple gambling
opportunities. It's all very well to say you'll attract money if
you offer casino gambling. But when the money goes, the first thing
that'll go with it is horse racing.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he grasped changes that seemed likely to improve racing.
One of the first things he did as president of Pimlico was to
introduce the Western starting gate to Maryland, ending the era of
confused or delayed starts. He also introduced the photo-finish
camera, ending the era when close races often resulted in incorrect
calls or dead heats. When he came to New York in 1940 as president
of Belmont, he promptly gave priority to installing the new
parimutuel system, which replaced bookmakers at tracks the
following spring.
</P>
<P>
   But on farm and backstretch, where he remained a familiar figure
even in the late years of his life, he clung to one theory as a
horseman: ``Breed the best to the best, and hope for the best.''

VODAFONE MAY SEEK MANNESMAN AG IN BIGGEST HOSTILE TAKEOVER BID
EVER 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Vodafone Airtouch PLC, the world's leading mobile phone
operator, is expected to announce as early as Monday a hostile bid
that could be worth more than $117 billion for Mannesmann AG, the
German telecommunications conglomerate, and Orange PLC, the British
phone company that Mannesmann has committed to buy, executives
close to the Vodafone planning said in London on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Such an effort would easily be the biggest hostile takeover of
all time, surpassing the record $80 billion unfriendly bid by
Pfizer Inc. for its pharmaceutical rival Warner-Lambert, made only
last week. It also would mark the start of a bruising battle
between Vodafone and Mannesmann, two of Europe's most successful
and aggressive telecommunications companies.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone officials spent Friday in marathon meetings in London
with advisers, working out details of a plan rooted in internal
company discussions that began a month ago, when Mannesmann
announced a deal to acquire Orange for $33 billion. That event
began what amounts to a turf war over Europe's wireless
communications networks.
</P>
<P>
   Though Vodafone had yet to settle Friday evening on an exact
price to bid, executives close to the talks said that the company
was mulling an offer of 200 to 210 euros a share, or $206.26 to
$216.57, for Mannesmann, which has about 389.9 million shares
outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether a Vodafone bid would be entirely in stock
or a mixture of stock and cash, but the high end of the price range
under consideration would value the German company at $84.4
billion. That price is a 13 percent premium to Mannesmann's closing
price Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It was also unclear Friday night how much Vodafone would pay for
Orange. But if it paid the same amount Mannesmann has committed to
pay, that would make the total value of a Vodafone bid as high as
$117.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone officials planned to continue working on their bidding
strategy through the weekend, but the executives stressed that as
with any major hostile bid, the company could still decide to
abandon the effort.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Vodafone declined to comment on whether a
hostile bid for Mannesmann was imminent or even under
consideration. But the company did issue a statement that
acknowledged the possibility of a tie-up with Mannesmann.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vodafone Airtouch continues to evaluate a broad range of
opportunities to participate in the further consolidation of the
global wireless market including possible ways to develop Vodafone
Airtouch's existing longstanding relationship with Mannesmann,''
the statement said, referring to partnerships with Mannesmann in
Germany, France and Italy. The statement added: ``No decisions have
yet been taken with regard to any specific options.''
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone shares dropped 6.6 percent, to 296.25 pence, or
$4.8105, in heavy trading here in London as investors reacted to
speculation that Vodafone might overpay for Mannesmann. Shares of
Mannesmann continued to rise Friday, up 3.9 percent, to a record
185.20 euros, or $192.923. Mannesmann shares have risen 25 percent
in the last week on speculation that it might be acquired.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann is a scrappy and fast-growing company that has become
a major competitor to Germany's former phone monopoly, Deutsche
Telekom AG. It is no stranger to adversity and has made clear that
a Vodafone bid would be unwelcome.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mannesmann chief executive Klaus Esser said in a conference call
with analysts that he felt Mannesmann's relationship had always
been with Airtouch, the wireless phone company that Vodafone bought
for $60 billion last June. Esser said that deal just complicated
matters for Mannesmann.
</P>
<P>
   Esser, who last week said he was skeptical that Vodafone would
make a bid, added: ``It would be a tremendous mistake for
Mannesmann or Vodafone to do anything value-destroying rather than
value-enhancing.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that if Vodafone proceeded with a bid, it would be
paying a considerable premium that some considered wildly
excessive. They pointed out, however, that a tie-up of the two
companies makes strategic sense because their mobile phone
networks, now scattered over several different countries, would
create the first truly pan-European wireless operator if they were
combined. That is a huge advantage, because such a network could
offer customers lower prices, better service and greater geographic
reach.
</P>
<P>
   Others said Vodafone might want to acquire Mannesmann as a
defensive response to Mannesmann's acquisition of Orange, which
greatly strengthens Mannesmann and makes it a formidable rival to
Vodafone on the company's home ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mannesmann has really forced Vodafone's hand by becoming a
direct competitor,'' one analyst said. ``Vodafone has to buy them
almost by default to save itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone would almost certainly be forced to sell Orange to
placate regulators because it would have a stranglehold on the
British mobile phone market. Executives close to Vodafone said the
company was already lining up potential bidders who would not
represent a strategic threat if they were to buy Orange. It has
held discussions with France Telecom, the executives said, about
buying Orange.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone officials are also debating whether to sell
Mannesmann's extensive land line network, the executives said,
though they added that Mannesmann's land lines would benefit a
combined company.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone would also try to sell off Mannesmann's engineering
division, which Esser had already pledged to sell. Still, the
executives said, such a sale by Vodafone could take as long as a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible obstacle is a Mannesmann shareholder resolution
dating from the 1970s that forbids any single holder from owning
more than 5 percent of the company's voting rights, although that
restriction is to expire next June. If Vodafone pursues a bid for
Mannesmann, the executives said, it might take more than six months
to complete, which would make the voting rights issue moot. In
addition, the executives said, if Vodafone could acquire enough
shares of Mannesmann it could overturn the voting rule.

IN EXPANDING PLATFORM, FORBES ATTACKS CHINA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES STERNGOLD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   YORBA LINDA, Calif. _ Steve Forbes, the wealthy magazine
publisher and candidate for the Republican presidential nomination,
came to the shrine dedicated to the president who opened modern
diplomatic relations with China Friday and launched a bitter attack
on the Chinese government, saying he would militarily contain the
country and deny it trade relations if it did not moderate its
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   A day after delivering a speech on domestic issues at the Reagan
Library north of Los Angeles, Forbes came to the Richard Nixon
Library and Birthplace in this suburb of strip malls and tract
homes 50 miles southeast of Los Angeles to offer what his staff had
described as a major foreign policy address. But the speech
included almost no mention of Europe or the rest of the globe and
instead involved a series of angry denunciations of China, which he
described as militarily and politically aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   The speech appeared to be part of Forbes' effort to transform
himself from a candidate focused largely on one issue, tax reform,
as had been the case in 1996, to the most conservative candidate in
the presidential race on a range of issues, such as abortion, which
he vigorously opposes, and military expansion, which he supports.
Many conservatives criticize the communist government of China as a
major peril, and Friday Forbes embraced that position
enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes declared, in stark Cold War terms, ``The rise of China as
a new power is one of the greatest challenges we face as a nation
as we enter the 21st century,'' and he compared the country to
Germany and Japan in the years leading up to World War II.
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that, if he were elected, there would be ``no more
leaving our children and our allies vulnerable to Chinese nuclear
missiles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And no more sweetheart trade deals,'' he continued.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is opposed to China's entry into the World Trade
Organization and said he would revoke China's Most Favored Nation
trading trade status if it did not open up politically and end its
military threat to its neighbors, especially Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   In comments after his prepared speech here, Forbes also attacked
the International Monetary Fund, the body formed after World War II
to foster financial stability, and another target of conservative
ire.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have done enormous harm around the globe,'' he said of
the fund, promising to close it down if elected.
</P>
<P>
   The speech Friday was in keeping with the overall tone of
Forbes' campaign, in which he has generally described imminent
threats he says America faces and the ways in which he would
confront those threats.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes characterized China as America's greatest rival, and he
suggested that even while the country was on the verge of what he
described as a political implosion it was pursuing expansionist
designs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In short, China is an immensely important yet intensely
unstable country,'' Forbes said, and he quoted a Chinese dissident
predicting that the communist government would fall within 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that he wanted to strengthen America's military
involvement in Asia, where the country already maintains huge bases
in Japan and South Korea. ``America must be absolutely committed to
remain the premier military power in the Pacific,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes was scornful of the Clinton administration's China
policy, saying that in the president's first term it ``had all the
predictability of a drunk driving on the road.'' He added, ``I call
it a study in confusion and mixed signals, often degenerating into
appeasement.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he would put in place tough sanctions against any
company owned by the Chinese military, companies that use prison
labor and companies that traffic in weapons of mass destruction. If
their behavior does not change, and if China does not halt its
pattern of human rights abuses, particularly what he said is
religious persecution, Forbes promised to cut back on China's
access to American markets.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes described the decade since the protests and killings at
Tiananmen Square as a time ``of drift, indecision and plain bad
judgment'' in which the country has been suffering increasing
instability and a spiritual malaise.
</P>
<P>
   Economists, however, describe it as a time of unparalleled
growth and increasing openness. Nicholas Lardy, a China scholar at
the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., said that while
China has made clear threats at Taiwan, ``the economic reforms have
continued after Tiananmen.''
</P>
<P>
   China's total trade with other countries has nearly tripled, to
about $325 million last year from $112 billion in 1989. In fact,
China's trade surplus with the United States has ballooned to more
than $50 billion this year, as American consumers have become
increasingly dependent on the inexpensive products shipped here
from China.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, foreign investment in China, welcomed by the
Chinese government, has shot up from about $3 billion a year in the
late 1980s to close to $45 billion a year now. The country's
economic growth rate has averaged 8 percent to 10 percent over the
past decade, Lardy said, bringing prosperity to millions of people
in China.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said there was ``a great spiritual awakening going on
behind the Great Wall today,'' and that he would support those
movements and battle the government's religious persecution by
beefing up Radio Free Asia and attempting to create a Web site
focused on China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is the time to intensify our efforts to communicate the
good news of freedom and faith in God to a people living in great
darkness,'' said Forbes.

<P>
   PARIS _ Robert Kramer, an American movie director whose
portrayals of militants caught up in the antiwar movement of the
late 1960s and early 1970s earned him a prominent place in modern
political cinema, died on Wednesday in a hospital in Rouen, France,
at the age of 60. Friends gave the cause of death as meningitis.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kramer was best known in the United States for his
radical early movies, notably ``The Edge,'' ``Ice'' and
``Milestones,'' he remained a prolific filmmaker after he moved to
Paris in 1980. ``Doc's Kingdom'' and ``Route 1/U.S.A.'' were among
his later films that were also released in the United States. At
the time of his death, he had just completed a new movie, ``Cities
of the Plains.''
</P>
<P>
   Kramer's films never reached a wide audience, but they had a
loyal following in the world of avant-garde and experimental cinema
and were frequently featured at film festivals around the world.
``A Toute Allure'' was one of three official French selections for
the 1982 Cannes International Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   After his 1980 film ``Guns'' was shown at the New York Film
Festival, Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times that ``its
director is one of the most exciting filmmakers we have and it's
incredible that he can find financing only in France.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul McIsaac, an American actor who appeared in several of
Kramer's films, said an implosion of the radical movement in the
United States also prompted the director to move to France. ``The
French film world attracted him because he could continue to be
political,'' McIsaac said in a telephone interview from New York.
</P>
<P>
   But while his films remained broadly political (for instance,
``Doc's Kingdom,'' made in 1987, is about a burned-out former
radical living in Portugal), they were no less distinguished by his
strongly personal directing style. For him, reality and fiction,
like art and life, constantly blurred so that, as he once said,
``one day or other all these films that I'm making will make up a
single long film, a `story' that is always developing.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in New York on June 22, 1939, Kramer studied philosophy and
Western European history at Swarthmore College and Stanford
University, where he emerged as a committed leftist. After
organizing a community project in an African-American area in
Newark in 1965, he helped found the Newsreel movement, which
between 1967 and 1971 made some 60 documentaries and short films
about radical political subjects and the antiwar movement.
</P>
<P>
   It was during this period that Kramer also made ``The Edge'' and
``Ice,'' which won him the attention of American film experts.
``Ice,'' for example, focused on ``imminent urban guerrilla warfare
in the United States'' against an American regime intervening
repressively in Mexico. ``It is an awfully proud and humorless film
and although I can't say that I really like it, I do admire it,''
Canby wrote at the time, ``and I'd recommend it to anyone
interested in politics or movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing ``Milestones'' in 1975, Canby again referred to
Kramer's seriousness. ``Mr. Kramer's concerns are so particular,
and his manner usually so humorless, that one doesn't easily
recognize his talent as one of the most original and gifted young
filmmakers,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In his review of ``Guns,'' Canby developed this idea. ``Mr.
Kramer seems incapable of shooting a scene, framing a shot or
catching a line of dialogue that isn't loaded with information one
usually finds only in the best, the most spare poetry,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer is survived by his wife, Erika, and their daughter, Keja,
as well as by Rain Kramer, his daughter from an earlier marriage.

WINDFALL AT UPS? NOT FOR ALL  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 14) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ga.)   (af)  
 By MICHAEL E. KANELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In Silicon Valley and the world of the Internet, an
initial public offering is an occasion for wild celebration, as
employees from chief marketers to mail-room assistants count their
riches.
</P>
<P>
   At UPS, that is not necessarily the case.
</P>
<P>
   The United Parcel Service offering, first traded on Wednesday,
may have been historic, but among some hourly workers, it seemed
like someone else's history.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the employees who move 12 million packages a day were
pleased with their gains from buying shares at about half the
offering price. But for others, the UPS stock sale became an
example of how a benefit for workers can become an aggravation when
their company has unsettled labor relations.
</P>
<P>
   For some of these workers, the offering, rather than creating a
shared sense of ownership and gain, may have increased tensions as
they saw how much more money was made by members of management. The
stock offering came only two years after a 15-day strike by
drivers, loaders and handlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't buy UPS stock; that's a conflict of interest with
me,'' said Willie Harris, a UPS driver for 12 years, as he waited
in line on Thursday morning at a Burger King near a dispatch center
just outside Atlanta. Not that he shuns hometown companies, he
added: ``I buy Delta stock. And Coca-Cola.''
</P>
<P>
   In the biggest initial stock offering ever, UPS sold 109.4
million shares at $50 each; the stock ended the week at $71.9375.
Many managers, who have long been able to buy stock, made hundreds
of thousands of dollars. Others, who have been eligible to buy
stock only since 1995, typically made less even if they did invest.
</P>
<P>
   Of the roughly 205,000 unionized workers at UPS, about 66,000
have bought stock. Their average holdings are about 300 shares,
yielding average gains of less than $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   Many workers are still smarting over issues that were at the
heart of the 1997 strike, including wages and the company's
reliance on part-time drivers who would much rather be full-time.
</P>
<P>
   The company declined to comment. At a news conference on
Wednesday, James P. Kelly, the chairman, said, ``The relationship
with our hourly employees has definitely improved and will continue
to improve.''
</P>
<P>
   John A. Challenger, chief executive of the consulting and
outplacement company Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas, said bitterness
often lingers for years after a confrontation between labor and
management. A company should try to ease tensions by having
managers meet with workers in groups and one-on-one to build trust,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But overcoming the bitterness can be very difficult, Challenger
said, especially for workers. ``If the battle hasn't ended in your
mind, if you still feel you haven't gotten what you deserve, then
each new instance just opens the wound,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many workers who do hold stock assume that the biggest gainers
were executives. ``And that's fine,'' said Daniel Pinner, a driver
for six years. ``I think it's good for the company to have people
running it who have a big stake in it. That way, if things go
badly, they'd lose a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Without saying how much he owns, Pinner said he wasn't cashing
in just yet. ``I'm probably going to hold on,'' he said. ``It's a
good company and things seem to look good for the company's future.
I'll probably keep buying.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even Pinner is concerned about management's loyalties in the
face of ballooning stock values. ``The only danger I see,'' he
said, ``is that some of the more talented management people may see
it as a way to retire, and it wouldn't be good for any company to
lose its most talented people.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris, recalling the public support that UPS strikers received
two years ago, said he wondered whether public ownership of the
company's stock could mean greater support for management next
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they get all of you to buy stock and then if we go to
strike, we'll get booed, we'll get things thrown at us,'' he said.
In future talks, he added, the company would therefore be more
likely to take a hard line.
</P>
<P>
   Public stock ownership, however, does not appear to have reduced
popular support for, say, striking flight attendants at airlines.
Striking airline pilots, who are better paid, have attracted less
sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   At UPS, salaries for drivers, loaders and handlers start at less
than $10 an hour. While more experienced workers earn about $22 an
hour, that may not leave much leeway for investing.
</P>
<P>
   Workers like Jack Jordan, a driver for 18 years, have more
immediate concerns than shares and offerings. Steering his truck
into an office park, Jordan began pulling boxes from the shelves,
then paused to shrug. ``I don't buy stocks,'' he said. ``I just
don't mess around with it.''
</P>
<P>
   What about the chance to have made thousands of dollars on UPS
stock? Jordan nodded, acknowledging that the stock had done well.
He ventured a small smile. ``I'm not disappointed, really,'' he
said. ``It's just water under the bridge.''

ON TAPE, COLUMBINE KILLER THANKS GUN DEALERS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOLDEN, Colo. _ In the weeks before the massacre at Columbine
High School, the two teen-age killers made a videotape in which
they chillingly described the act they were about to commit and
assured future viewers that they were acting alone and that no one
knew what they were planning.
</P>
<P>
   Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris thanked two local gun dealers for
helping them obtain the weapons they would later use when they
burst into the school on April 30 and killed 13 people before
killing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to ensure that none of his or Harris' friends or
family members would be charged in the shootings, Klebold, looking
directly into the camera, said: ``Let me tell you this much, they
have no clue. So don't blame them and arrest them for what we
did.''
</P>
<P>
   The remarks by Klebold and others by Harris were revealed Friday
during an emotional hearing in a district court here, where Mark E.
Manes, 22, a computer systems manager, was sentenced to nine years
in prison for selling one of the guns used at Columbine to Klebold.
The sentencing guidelines could have allowed the judge, Henry
Nieto, to impose a prison term twice as long.
</P>
<P>
   Three months ago, Manes pleaded guilty to two felony charges,
selling a handgun to a juvenile and possessing a dangerous weapon.
</P>
<P>
   The judge imposed a sentence of six years for the first charge
and three for the second.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining his decision, Nieto appeared to be balancing the
interests of both the victims and Manes, saying, ``I don't believe
anything we do here today will comfort the victims.'' But referring
to the charge of selling a weapon to a juvenile, he added, ``This
crime demonstrates the maximum harm that can occur from a violation
of this statute.''
</P>
<P>
   Manes spent most of the three-hour hearing seated at the defense
table with his head down. Before Nieto imposed his sentence, Manes
stood and faced him and said, emphatically, he had no idea what
Harris and Klebold were planning when they bought the gun and
practiced shooting it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was horrified,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``There is no way I can adequately express my sorrow
to the families of the victims of Columbine. It is something I will
regret the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The sentencing followed more than an hour of wrenching testimony
by family members of nine of the victims in the shootings, many of
whom characterized Manes as no less guilty of the killings than
Harris and Klebold, and all of whom asked Nieto to impose the
longest sentence possible.
</P>
<P>
   Several broke down and cried as they spoke; and two families
used stirring musical videotaped presentations of their child who
was killed to emphasize the depth of their loss.
</P>
<P>
   In addressing the court, Kristen Townsend, whose sister Lauren
Townsend was gunned down, spoke with tears in her eyes and said:
``I want a full sentence not to seek revenge but to keep some
dignity for my sister's life and her death.''
</P>
<P>
   Some relatives used the opportunity to ask Nieto to send a
message that would discourage future illegal acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court should impose a sentence which will send a message
of deterrence to others who might consider providing dangerous
weapons to youngsters in violation of the law,'' said Betty Cook,
the aunt of another victim, Isaiah Shoels, reading a statement from
the boy's parents, Michael and Vonda.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had our way the defendant would never be allowed on the
streets again. Life is too precious for anyone to contribute in any
manner to the death of another.''
</P>
<P>
   One parent, Thomas Mauser, whose son, Daniel, was killed, said:
``I ask you clearly to make a statement that this will deter other
crimes,'' he said. ``Some would say I am scapegoating Manes for a
terrible crime. But no. I've had to think about that a lot. It is
clear to me what his role is, and his sentence should reflect what
that was.''
</P>
<P>
   In arguing for a maximum penalty, Steven L. Jensen, the
Jefferson County prosecutor, tried to convey to the judge that
absent Manes' relationship with the killers, the tragedy might not
have occurred.
</P>
<P>
   As his only witness, the lead detective in the case, Kate
Battan, recounted the chronology of how the killers, who were 17 at
the time, met Manes at a weekend gun show in January and how he
purchased for Klebold a Tec-9 semiautomatic handgun for $500 and
later _ the day before the killings _ 100 rounds of ammunition.

HILLARY CLINTON DENOUNCES REMARKS BY MRS. ARAFAT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also BC-MRSCLINTON-GIULIANI and BC-MRSCLINTON POLITICS) 
(ko) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG     
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PETRA, Jordan _ Hillary Rodham Clinton rebuked the wife of
Palestian leader Yasser Arafat on Friday for accusing Israel on
Thursday of causing cancer among Palestinians through the use of
toxic gas, calling Mrs. Arafat's statements inflammatory rhetoric
that harmed peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Against a backdrop of rugged desert mountains in this valley of
rock-hewn Nabatean tombs that is Jordan's most famous tourist
attraction, Mrs. Clinton went out of her way to denounce the
remarks by Suha Arafat, even as critics at home wondered aloud why
she had waited a day to react.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, who is on a Middle East tour, sat silently in the
West Bank town of Ramallah on Thursday as Mrs. Arafat gave a speech
that painted a grim picture of environmental havoc and disease
during the years of Israeli occupation. Mrs. Arafat said that the
Israeli security forces had used ``poisonous gas,'' apparently a
reference to tear-gas, and that it had caused increased cases of
cancer among women and children.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Friday by reporters about those remarks, Mrs. Clinton
responded at length, saying they violated an understanding reached
during meetings last week in Oslo between President Clinton, Prime
Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not believe that any kind of public inflammatory
statements or excessive rhetoric is helpful to the peace process,''
Mrs. Clinton said, ``and in fact is contrary to the agreement that
Prime Minister Barak and Chairman Arafat made at Oslo to avoid such
public comments and instead take all these things to the
negotiating table.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton asserted that the agreement ``should apply to all
of us'' as Israel and the Palestinians moved to complex
negotiations on a final peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who supports this effort for resolving the
outstanding issues,'' Mrs. Clinton said, ``should refrain from
inflammatory rhetoric and baseless accusations and from any public
comment that could in any way affect adversely what the parties are
attempting to achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``We ought to leave the talking to the negotiators,
and those of us who are supporting the process should be especially
sensitive to what we say and how we conduct ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton said she did not react immediately when Mrs. Arafat
spoke because of an incomplete translation from Arabic and an
initial sense among the American delegation that the remarks had
been ``part of a very common pattern of complaints that have been
heard for decades and were not worthy of any particular comment at
that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Only later, when a fuller translation of Mrs. Arafat's remarks
was obtained and after Barak's office accused her of ``poisoning
the public atmosphere,'' did Mrs. Clinton issue a written statement
of disapproval, followed by her stronger criticism Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton parried criticism of her visit to Ramallah, saying
she had gone there in the pursuit of peace. ``I will go anywhere I
can to promote the peace process,'' she said, adding: ``It is
unfortunate that there are any questions about what was a very
straightforward occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   If her visit to the West Bank was fraught with controversy,
Friday's journey to Petra was trouble-free. Applauded and cheered
by tourists, Mrs. Clinton posed with her daughter, Chelsea, in
front of an imposing royal tomb that has become Petra's trademark.
</P>
<P>
   She went on to announce an increase in American aid for
historical preservation at Petra, and together with Queen Rania of

   ``Talibanization,'' the destabilizing export of Afghan-style
radical Islam, may be a new term in the American political lexicon.
</P>
<P>
   But in Central and South Asia, where the repercussions of the
superstrict Taliban rule of Afghanistan have been widely felt, the
word has become all too familiar.
</P>
<P>
   As political fragmentation, economic meltdown, ethnic and
sectarian warfare, and Islamic fundamentalism tighten their grip on
Pakistan and much of the rest of the region, the dangerous behavior
of Afghanistan's leaders is no longer a local affair.
</P>
<P>
   For Western nations to presume that they can safely exploit the
vast oil and gas riches of Central Asia without first helping bring
peace to Afghanistan is unrealistic to the extreme. A new Great
Game is being played in the region.
</P>
<P>
   At stake, however, are no longer questions of mere political
influence or who gets to build oil and gas pipelines where. These
issues will be irrelevant unless the West figures out how to stop
the spreading conflagration in Afghanistan _ and fast.
</P>
<P>
   For Afghanistan to be at the center of both dialogue and
conflict between civilizations is nothing new. The country's
location at the crossroads between Iran, Central Asia, the Arabian
Sea and India has given its mountain passes a strategic
significance for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   At certain times, Afghanistan has acted as a buffer between
competing empires and ideologies. At others it has served as a
corridor through which armies marched.
</P>
<P>
   Repeated efforts to colonize the country, most recently by the
British and the former Soviets, have failed and in the process
given the Afghans a fierce sense of independence and pride.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, patron of the Afghan rebellion against the
Soviet invaders, walked away after the Soviet Union withdrew its
last troops in 1989. The Afghans, once on the frontline of the Cold
War, were left with a devastated country. One million had died
during the ten-year occupation.
</P>
<P>
   But only three years later, when Kabul fell to the
``mujahideen'' warriors who had fought off the Soviets, gory civil
war again gripped the country, fueled by neighboring countries
trying to carve out areas of influence. By now, the civil war has
pitted the majority Pushtun population in the south and east
against the ethnic minorities of the north _ Tajik, Uzbek, Hazara
and Turkmen.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety percent of Afghans are Sunni Muslims, although Shiites
predominate among the Hazaras and some Tajik clans settled in
central Afghanistan. Traditional Islam in Afghanistan believed in
minimum government with as little state interference as possible.
Another key factor contributing to Afghan tolerance was the
enormous popularity of Sufism, a mystical and undogmatic branch of
Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Taliban arrived, none of Islam's extreme orthodox
sects _ such as the conservative Wahhabis from Saudi Arabia _ had
found a home in Afghanistan. But the Taliban emerged at a critical
juncture, as the country was fractured by warlords, and an
ideological vacuum grew within the Islamist movement.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their predecessors, the Taliban have little knowledge of
Islamic and Afghan history, of ``sharia'' (pure Islamic law) or the
Quran. Their exposure to the radical Islamic debate around the
world is minimal; indeed, they are so rigid in their beliefs that
they admit no discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan believes that a Taliban-controlled Afghanistan will be
an ally and give its army strategic depth in its ongoing conflict
with India. In particular, Islamabad considers support for the
Taliban necessary because of its dispute with India over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban and fundamentalist groups in Pakistan give major
support to Kashmiri insurgents resisting New Delhi's control of
Indian Kashmir. Islamabad therefore cannot drop its support for
them without affecting the Kashmir cause it espouses.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the increasing Islamicization of the Kashmiri struggle has
undermined both the Kashmiris' own demand for self-determination
from India and Pakistan's bid to win international mediation of the
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The Kashmiri independence movement is losing world sympathy as
more and more Pakistani and Arab recruits join the fight and turn
it into a Taliban holy war, or ``jihad.'' The longer this goes on,
the less chance there will be that the territorial dispute will
ever be peacefully resolved. Day by day, the danger grows.
</P>
<P>
   With their porous borders, weak security apparatuses, and
crisis-torn economies, the five former Soviet Central Asian
republics _ Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and
Uzbekistan _ have every reason to fear the turmoil emanating from
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The threats include the flow of drugs and weapons and a possible
flood of refugees if the opposition to the Taliban, the Northern
Alliance, is defeated.
</P>
<P>
   But Central Asia's leaders, who have not changed since the
Soviet era, are growing increasingly authoritarian. Their rigged
elections have undermined democratic alternatives, leaving
underground Islamist movements as the only political opposition.
Widespread poverty and unemployment provide a fertile recruiting
base for young militants.
</P>
<P>
   During the recent Afghan civil war, the newly independent
Central Asian states supported their ethnic kin in northern
Afghanistan, who provided a buffer against the spread of
fundamentalism. That buffer has now been virtually eliminated. The
Taliban control Afghan territory bordering Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan
and Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
   Yet apart from Turkmenistan, which has declared itself neutral
in the Afghan conflict, these states continue to support the
weakened Northern Alliance. Ahmad Shah Masud, the alliance's ethnic
Tajik military commander, keeps a major resupply base in southern
Tajikistan, where he receives arms from Russia and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Iran is also threatened by the Taliban. The Shiite regime in
Tehran has long opposed Pushtun fundamentalism because it is backed
by a regional rival _ Pakistan _ and because it is Sunni-dominated.
</P>
<P>
   China too has been affected by the ascendance of the Taliban.
Beijing shunned the civil war in Afghanistan until February 1999,
when it first made overtures to the Taliban in an attempt to stem
the tide of Afghan heroin flooding Xinjiang. The heroin was helping
fund Islamist and nationalist opposition to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those militants trained and fought with the Afghan
mujahideen since 1986, and Chinese officials say the arms and
explosives the rebels have used against Chinese security forces
come from Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban's reasons for its regional adventurism are a mixture
of naivete, frustration, and ideology. At one level, the Taliban
insist that Afghan tribal tradition obliges them to give aid and
sanctuary to neighbors. But the Taliban are also furious with Iran
and Uzbekistan for their military support of the Northern Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   And Kabul is deeply frustrated with its rejection by the
international community and the Muslim world, which has refused to
recognize the Taliban government. By harboring dissidents,
Afghanistan gets its revenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our prestige is spreading across the region because we have
truly implemented Islam, and this makes the Americans and some
neighbors very nervous,'' says Afghan Information Minister Amir
Khan Muttaqi.
</P>
<P>
   That is putting it lightly. As militants from around the world
flock to it for sanctuary, Kabul only increases its support for the
wave of Talibanization it hopes to unleash on the region and
beyond.

BIG INCREASES IN PRODUCTIVITY BY WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>

(lh) 
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most debated economics issue in America today is whether
workers are becoming ever more efficient, thanks to computers and
the Internet. And the Labor Department, in the most comprehensive
review of the data to date, says there has indeed been an
improvement in this decade, mainly in the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   The review, stretching back to 1959, came attached to the
department's announcement Friday that productivity _ the key
measure of labor efficiency _ had shot up in the third quarter at
an annual rate of 4.2 percent. Workers manufactured that much more
on average for each hour on the job, or sold that much more or
increased a huge variety of services. It was the biggest quarterly
jump in nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
   But quarterly productivity numbers bounce around. The third
quarter jump, for example, followed a rise of only 0.6 percent in
the second quarter. What counts are long-term trends, and the Labor
Department, using new information about the economy, revised its
productivity data back 40 years. The new set of figures showed the
1990s to be unmistakably better than the 1970s and 1980s _ pulled
up by four powerful years.
</P>
<P>
   Four-year spurts occur from time to time. There was one in the
1980s, but it was not strong enough to raise the average for the
whole decade as the last four years have done for the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no one point where we can say that we are on a new
upward trend line,'' said Michael Harper, chief of the division of
productivity research at the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor
Statistics. ``But in each of the last four years we have seen a
little more evidence that we may be.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest productivity numbers seem likely to work against an
increase in interest rates when the Federal Reserve's policy makers
meet on Tuesday. More output per worker, at a moment of full
employment in the United States, reduces the odds of shortages and
rising prices, two big concerns of the Fed. What's more, retail
sales leveled off in October, remaining unchanged from September,
the Commerce Department said in a separate report Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Productivity enjoys much less public attention than inflation or
economic growth or employment. The concept is more arcane. But no
measure is more important. A nation's standard of living rises with
productivity. Given limited population growth, a nation can acquire
more goods and services only if the existing workers produce more
in a given work day.
</P>
<P>
   But the Labor Department's new numbers, for all the improvement
they display, were not enough to settle a national debate over
whether a ``new economy'' has really emerged.
</P>
<P>
   They fail to answer these questions: Does the recent jump in
productivity simply mean that companies and their workers are
stretching themselves for a while to satisfy the strong demand of a
booming economy, and when the economy cools so will their
productivity? Or is there a permanent change in which computers and
the Internet are generating the long-term efficiencies that in the
past came with the spread of railroads, the invention of
electricity and the proliferation of cars and trucks?
</P>
<P>
   Optimists like Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch
&AMP; Co., say the New Economy has indeed arrived, and if the revised
numbers fail to capture the arrival, then they are still
under-measuring productivity. ``We are on an accelerating
productivity trend,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But for the skeptics, the revisions leave too much unsaid.
Productivity is calculated by adding up all the output of an
economy, expressed in dollars, and then dividing by the number of
labor hours spent to produce that output. The revisions increased
the output side of the calculation, but failed to correct a
mismeasurement of hours, says Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has done a terrible job in uncovering the labor
effort required to produce all the new output,'' he said, noting
that in his own case, Morgan Stanley tells the Labor Department
that he has a 40-hour-a-week schedule, which is true. But in fact
Roach works 70 or 80 hours, common practice on Wall Street and in
other industries, too.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With hours rising only slowly in the official data, unit labor
costs _ the amount spent on wages and benefits to produce each
piece of merchandise or each service _ rose a very mild 0.6 percent
in the third quarter. The increases remained similarly mild in the
revised data. Economists cite these numbers in trying to explain
the low inflation rate in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The productivity revisions announced Friday resulted in changes
only for the years after 1973. From 1959 until 1973, productivity
rose at an annual rate of 2.9 percent, the same as the old,
unrevised average. Between 1973 and 1995, however, the rate of
growth was a fairly steady 1.4 percent to 1.6 percent a year,
Harper said. That was slower, of course, than the pre-1973 number,
but a considerable improvement over the unrevised average of about
1 percent a year for the 1973 to 1995 period.
</P>
<P>
   And then in 1995 a boom kicked in. Economic growth soared and
productivity jumped to an annual growth rate of 2.6 percent from
the third quarter of 1995 through this year's third quarter, far
better than the 1.9 percent figure before the revision. For the
decade as a whole, the new productivity growth rate was 2 percent a
year, much better than the unrevised 1.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The productivity revisions reflect new ways of measuring the
nation's output announced recently by the Commerce Department. One
major change has been in the calculation of inflation, which has
been revised downward for the years since 1978. That raises the
dollar value of the nation's output of goods and services. The
dollar total is adjusted for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Another big change involves computer software, a huge item,
particularly in recent years. For the first time, software is being
counted as a lasting investment that adds to the nation's total
output, and therefore must be listed separately in the national
accounts, adding greatly to total output. Under the old system, the
tens of billions of dollars spent on software were considered an
expense, lost in the value of other items.
</P>
<P>
   Software, in effect, has become a capital investment, and the
rise in the productivity growth rate in the late 1990s reflects a
sharp increase in capital spending, not only for software but for
new machinery and equipment, particularly computers.
</P>
<P>
   Capital spending has contributed in the past to temporary surges
in productivity. ``What is not clear,'' said Robert Gordon, a
Northwestern University economist, ``is what would happen if we
pulled out the accelerating contribution of capital investment. How
much would be left that reflects a fundamental change brought about
by new technology analogous to the invention of the electric
motor.''

U.S. EXTENDS TRADE TALKS IN BEIJING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ In a last-ditch effort to reach an agreement on
China's entry into the World Trade Organization, American
negotiators decided overnight Friday to stay here a fourth day for
at least one more meeting.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, the Americans, practicing high-stakes
brinkmanship, had said that the talks so far had been fruitless and
announced that they were heading home.
</P>
<P>
   But after an exchange of messages during the night, the two
sides agreed to meet again Saturday to make another try.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Chinese have balked at demands for the thorough
opening of domestic industries to foreign ownership, which the
United States insists is a condition for China's entry into the
global trade body.
</P>
<P>
   Early Saturday, Tom Tripp, the spokesman for the American
negotiating team, said, ``Although progress has been slow in the
talks so far, because of the importance of the issues, both sides
thought it would be useful to have an additional day of meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   Tripp said that Charlene Barshefsky, the U.S. trade
representative, was meeting with ``senior Chinese officials.''
Officials in Washington said privately that the delegation had been
offered a meeting with Prime Minister Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
   In private, American officials expressed pessimism and
disappointment that, up to now, the Chinese had been unable to
match the market-opening concessions Zhu made in Washington last
April.
</P>
<P>
   One American official here said Saturday morning, ``There's been
very little progress at all toward anything that could be
considered a commercially satisfactory agreement in the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Clinton administration desperately wants to secure
China's entry into the trade body as a calming force in stormy
Chinese-American relations, it is under pressure from Congress and
American business interests to gain sweeping concessions.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese, while proceeding slowly toward a market economy,
fear the short-term social dislocations of opening industries to
outside competition and have pressed for more lenient terms of
entry.
</P>
<P>
   This week's talks, which follow more than a decade of fitful
negotiations and a near-agreement in April, have been widely seen
as make-or-break, and the administration is clearly anxious to
pursue all possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington on Friday, President Clinton said that differences
remained on a ``finite and limited number of issues'' and added,
``I have not given up.''
</P>
<P>
   Bringing China into the world organization soon has been a prime
goal of Clinton, and failure would be a setback for his strategy of
engagement with the world's most populous country.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese have been publicly silent about this week's
negotiations, and the Americans have not publicly described the
remaining areas of disagreement. One American diplomat said major
points of contention included the American demand that China allow
majority foreign ownership in the telecommunications and
financial-services industries.
</P>
<P>
   Other American officials said the negotiators had particularly
pressed China, without success, to open its securities industry to
outsiders. Garnering a foothold in China for Wall Street companies,
officials said, could broaden the political support for a deal even
if majority foreign ownership in telecommunications and certain
other sensitive sectors proved impossible.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a visit to Washington in April, Zhu agreed to open up most
industries to majority ownership by foreigners. But this week the
Chinese delegation, led by Foreign Trade Minister Shi Guangsheng,
has so far refused to match the April offer in important respects,
American officials said.
</P>
<P>
   China's backsliding may reflect not only Zhu's apparently
diminished power but a broader shift in the political atmosphere
here toward a more conservative and nationalistic stance. This
change gathered force during the Kosovo war last spring, when China
vehemently opposed the NATO bombing campaign, and it accelerated
after the bombing of China's Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, in
which three Chinese were killed.
</P>
<P>
   A failure to join the trade organization now would not mean that
China's gradual opening to outside competition, and its efforts to
overhaul hidebound state enterprises, would come to a stop,
economists here and abroad said.
</P>
<P>
   China and the United States had both hoped that an agreement
could be reached by Nov. 30, when discussions are to begin in
Seattle on a new round of global trade talks. China needs to
conclude bilateral accords with major partners before it can enter
the global body.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, administration officials privately said that an
agreement would be possible if China could match the terms it
offered in April.
</P>
<P>
   But in the intervening months, Chinese industrial and
bureaucratic interests began to lobby against such deep
concessions. Even military officers joined the fray, describing
control over the telecommunications sector, for example, as a
national security issue, said Joseph Fewsmith, a Chinese-politics
specialist at Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu, an impatient, straight-talking reformer who is popular
abroad and with ordinary Chinese, came under attack from
conservative politicians and ministers who want to preserve
national control of key industries.
</P>
<P>
   According to many reports, he no longer has control over the
trade talks or the overhaul of state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm convinced that Zhu Rongji remains prime minister in name
only,'' said Fewsmith, who recently visited China to examine trade
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu and his disciples hope that membership in the world
organization, and the resulting jolt of global competition, will
hasten the overhaul of a domestic economy still encrusted with
bloated state companies and monopolies.

 &HT;    Future of Ga. Lockheed Martin plant unclear as company mulls
consolidation
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Troubled Lockheed Martin Corp. acknowledged Friday it
is considering selling or closing some of its plants, raising new
questions about the future of its Marietta, Ga. facility.
</P>
<P>
   The aerospace giant has suffered a year of financial and
operational problems, and management is ruling out nothing as part
of a broad turnaround plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company is not restricting its review of possible actions
in any way,'' said Hugh Burns, a spokesman at the company's
Bethesda, Md., headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``As to whether any specific plant might be closed or
consolidated, everything is under review and no decision has been
made,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   One scenario is for the company to pull out of the Air
Force-owned Marietta plant. It could move the plant's
underperforming C-130J and F-22 programs to a Lockheed Martin
aircraft plant in Fort Worth, Texas, that has capacity to spare.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say the company could cut overhead and better
manage programs that way.
</P>
<P>
   The Marietta plant, headquarters to Lockheed Martin Aeronautical
Systems and 8,000 workers, has outlived other shutdown predictions
over the years as aircraft programs waxed and waned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's just a lot of speculating going on,'' said
Wayne Myrick, president of the Machinists union Local 709. ``It's
got a lot of good people upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Myrick said, the union ``absolutely is taking this very
seriously. We're very concerned about members' jobs.'' A downsizing
of 2,000 jobs already is under way at the plant because of slow
orders and high costs.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and politicians were divided Friday over the likelihood
of a shutdown of the Marietta plant, built during World War II to
produce B-29 bombers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of unthinkable to close such a historic facility as
Marietta, but given the financial straits of the corporation, you'd
have to say anything's possible,'' said Richard Aboulafia, an
aircraft industry analyst at Teal Group, a Washington, D.C.,
consultancy.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Bob Barr, whose district includes the Marietta plant,
downplayed the potential closing. ``These are simply rumors that we
have to put out every year,'' said Barr. ``I don't know why
everyone is so churned up over this. We're hearing rumors again.
Big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.), through a spokeswoman, expressed
similar confidence that the plant's future is secure.
</P>
<P>
   The latest flurry of speculation follows a Wall Street Journal
report that the company is considering the sale or shutdown of
``core assets,'' including aircraft plants, to boost its sagging
profits. Previously, the company's turnaround plan has involved
milder moves.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing problems recently forced Lockheed Martin to halve its
profit forecasts for 2000 and to dismiss two top executives. One
was military aircraft chief James A. ``Mickey'' Blackwell, who
oversaw the Marietta division and once worked there. Blackwell
couldn't be reached for comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin's new chief financial officer, Robert Stevens,
said the company can't afford to view any part of its business with
``pure emotional affection.''
</P>
<P>
   Company officials declined interview requests Friday, but Terry
Graham, the plant's No. 2 official, issued a memo to workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``As everyone knows, the corporation is going through a very
difficult time, but no decisions have been made to close or
relocate any facilities, including Marietta,'' Graham wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analyst Paul Nisbet, of JSA Research in Newport, R.I.,
said Lockheed Martin may be floating a ``trial balloon'' to gauge
the reaction of the Pentagon and Congress to a plant consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's made sense for a long time, but the politics were too
daunting in the past,'' Nisbet said. He noted that Georgia's clout
on military issues _ chiefly through former Sen. Sam Nunn and
former House Speaker Newt Gingrich _ has waned since their
departures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now things have fallen apart and they need to take actions
they should have before,'' Nisbet said. ``Politicians from Georgia
are somewhat less influential, so it's a good time to try.''
</P>
<P>
   Myrick, the union chief, said he talked Friday with Marietta
plant President Tom Burbage and was reassured, to a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said if nothing happened to the C-130J or F-22 programs
they would stay in Georgia,'' Myrick said. ``Of course, neither he
nor I can say what the corporation will do.''
</P>
<P>
   Myrick said he thinks it would cost Lockheed Martin $1 billion
or more to move the Marietta assembly lines to Texas. He noted the
company has spent millions retooling the C-130J line and building
specialized F-22 facilities. The plant has won industry and
Pentagon accolades for improving efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   But it has had trouble building and sustaining political support
for either the C-130J or F-22, contributing to broader corporate
woes.
</P>
<P>
   Nisbet estimates Lockheed Martin has lost upward of $1 billion
on the C-130J program because of slow sales and high development
costs. The company developed the updated model in the mid-'90s
without any advance Pentagon orders, which meant it accepted more
financial risk than usual with a new military plane.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin has sold 90 C-130Js to date but faces a sharp
slowdown in orders over the next few years, until the Air Force
begins replacing large numbers of older C-130s. Congress approved
only two C-130Js in the fiscal 2000 defense budget, with none
requested in the Pentagon's preliminary fiscal 2001 budget.
</P>
<P>
   The company is trying to persuade the Pentagon to fund 42 of the
planes over the next five years, enough to maintain production and,
it hopes, spur more foreign orders.
</P>
<P>
   The F-22 program is an Air Force darling but has been slowed by
political attacks. After heated debate this summer that threw the
entire program into doubt, Congress allotted money for six of the
new ``air superiority'' fighters in the fiscal 2000 budget, as the
Air Force had requested.
</P>
<P>
   It refused to move the program into the full production phase,
however, which analysts say would have made it less vulnerable to
future political attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin's corporate problems are far wider. Created by
the 1994 merger of Lockheed Corp. and Martin Marietta, the company
is the nation's No. 1 defense contractor.
</P>
<P>
   Nisbet and other analysts say the company has not smoothly
managed its far-flung operations. A particular trouble spot has
been its satellite and missile defense division, based in
Sunnyvale, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Aboulafia said any drastic moves in the aircraft
division may be premature. He said both the C-130J and F-22
programs are still likely to do well long-term, while Lockheed
Martin is also vying to win a lead contract for another new
warplane, the Joint Strike Fighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all that pans out, they are going to need plant capacity,''
he said. ``But it's hard to look down the road very far when Wall
Street's baying for your blood.''

 &HT;    Texas taxpayers footing bill for Bush's expanded security costs
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas taxpayers have spent nearly $1.8 million
so far this year to protect Gov. George W. Bush and Lt. Gov. Rick
Perry, more than nine times the average spent annually on security
before Bush became a Republican presidential hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   Figures disclosed late Friday by the Texas Department of Public
Safety show $1,790,384 had been spent on security through late
October, compared with $186,533 during 1995, Bush's first year as
governor.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 and 1997, the costs were $153,900 and $164,529,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1998, when Bush was considering a run at the
presidential nomination, the security costs had risen to $285,874,
according to the DPS figures.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign had previously said they had no plans to
reimburse taxpayers for the costs of presidential campaign security
and added that his Democratic predecessor, former Gov. Ann
Richards, traveled at taxpayer expense to help Bill Clinton win the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But state Democrats lashed out Friday at Bush, contending he
should reimburse Texans from his $57 million campaign warchest.
</P>
<P>
   Disclosure of the figures by DPS came as the result of requests
filed in July under the Texas Public Information Act by the Austin
American-Statesman, The Associated Press and Dallas-Fort Worth
television station KTVT _ after Bush launched his cross-country
campaign for the Republican presidential nomination with DPS
plainclothes security officers in tow.
</P>
<P>
   The DPS and Bush's office initially refused to make the
information public, claiming that allowing Texas taxpayers to know
how much was being spent would impair efforts to protect Bush. But
state Attorney General John Cornyn disagreed, ruling on Nov. 2 that
the information should be made public.
</P>
<P>
   Eight working days later, the DPS did so, just before closing
time Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn, however, also ruled that other security information such
as the number of troopers assigned to protect Bush, the salaries
and overtime spent on his protection detail, phone records and
travel expense details could be kept secret.
</P>
<P>
   DPS spokesman Tom Vinger said late Friday he could not elaborate
on the figures, the first disclosure of security expenses since
Bush hit the presidential campaign trail in June. At the time, DPS
officials acknowledged that the size of his security detail had
increased.
</P>
<P>
   While DPS officials previously have acknowledged that the added
expenses for security were coming from the agency's $330.5 million
budget, Vinger said he could not discuss details.
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides Friday night defended the additional security costs.
Campaign spokesman Scott McClellan said there was no plan to
reimburse the state for security that historically has been
provided to a governor by the DPS.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the legal responsibility of the Texas Department of
Public Safety to protect the governor at all times, whether the
governor is in state or out of state,'' said gubernatorial press
secretary Linda Edwards. ``In the past, the Department of Public
Safety has protected other Texas governors when traveling out of
state, including Governor Ann Richards when she traveled to
campaign for Bill Clinton in 1992.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry and his top aides could not immediately be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Democratic Party Chairwoman Molly Beth Malcolm blasted
Bush for spending state taxpayers' money ``on his own personal
ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush is forcing the taxpayers to pick up the tab for
a service he could easily afford to pay out of his huge pot of
campaign money,'' she said. ``The governor needs to be protected,
but it's a shame he's taking money that could be used for public
schools and children's health care . . . If Bush were the big
fiscal conservative he claims to be, he wouldn't be sticking the
taxpayers with a bill that big.''
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, U.S. Secret Service protection is offered to
``major presidential candidates'' _ usually about the time the
primaries are held. Federal taxpayers pay for Secret Service
security.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush has not offered to reimburse Texas taxpayers for the
DPS' extra security expenses associated with his presidential
campaign, federal campaign filings show his campaign has repaid at
least one out-of-state law enforcement agency for campaign security
_ in New Hampshire, where a primary is scheduled Feb. 1, 2000. In
June, the Bush campaign reimbursed the Goffstown Police Department
a total of $324 for two campaign stops.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks since he launched his GOP presidential bid, Bush
has traveled extensively outside Texas. During the past week alone,
he has been in Florida, South Carolina, Hew Hampshire, Michigan and
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Bush announced he would forego his gubernatorial salary
of $316.01 a day for each day he campaigned outside Texas. On those
days, Perry is paid the gubernatorial rate.

 (SUBS 4th graf to change `is debating' to `has debated'; there is
currently no bill under consideration)   (bl)  
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Carrying the battle flag of the Confederacy
through this birthplace of the Civil War, the hundreds of men
parading in their gray uniforms and the women in their black
widow's weeds knew exactly what was at stake in their struggle over
the memory of an earlier era.
</P>
<P>
   Their immediate journey was to rebury the remains of 22
Confederate sailors and a 3-year-old boy whose first resting place
had mistakenly been covered by the football stadium at the Citadel,
the military college here.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the marchers and the 2,500 others who joined
them at Magnolia Cemetery on Friday were there to invest the
history and the symbols of the region with tangible meaning, which
at that moment were under attack by many who see them in far
less-glorious terms.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few hours earlier, Gov. Jim Hodges had spent the morning
asking business leaders to help him find an honorable way to remove
the battle flag from atop the State Capitol. It has flown there,
usually in the face of many offended people, since 1962. The
Legislature, which has debated bills to remove the flag, has
resisted efforts to take down the flag, even after South Carolina
became the last state flying it.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious of those efforts began this summer, when the
national and local branches of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People gave up trying to negotiate the
removal of the flag and announced an economic boycott of South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing the effects of the boycott and the growing damage to the
state's reputation, an increasing number of organizations have
called for the flag's removal, including the South Carolina Chamber
of Commerce, the state Baptist Convention and Bob Jones University,
a bastion of the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   But even some legislators who might be inclined to compromise
say they won't do so while an economic musket is pointed at their
heads, and much of that traditional, prideful stubbornness was on
display Friday at Magnolia Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd, entirely white, was hardly representative of the
state, but many of those present said they had felt a twinge of
resentment when a national organization tried to tell them what
symbols their state was allowed to display.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of South Carolina have the right to choose what
flags they want to fly,'' said George Bragdon, a warehouse
supervisor from Lancaster, who was dressed in the gray flannel of
the 12th South Carolina Brigade, Company I, in which his
great-grandfather had served. ``No one from any other state can
tell us what to do. I would remind the NAACP that the South was
willing to go to war to protect its states' rights, and we are
still stubborn enough not to give in to this boycott.''
</P>
<P>
   Hodges, though he is eager to have the flag removed, essentially
had the same message in the speeches he has given all week,
including one Friday morning to the state Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NAACP boycott has drawn attention to the problem, which
has been helpful in trying to move it towards closure,'' Hodges
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it is clear that in my discussions with legislators who
hold the cards in whether or not this bill will pass, that the
boycott now stands as an obstacle,'' he added. ``Clearly, the only
way to show progress on this issue, I believe, is for the NAACP to
suspend its boycott as the first step towards resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   If the NAACP agrees to do so, the governor said, he will not
only press the Legislature to move the flag elsewhere on the
statehouse grounds, but will work to enact a state holiday honoring
Martin Luther King Jr. and to build a museum in Columbia that would
reflect the heritage of both blacks and whites in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   But the NAACP has rejected the proposal and intends to continue
its boycott.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight James, executive director of the South Carolina
Conference of Branches of the NAACP, said Friday that it was
ludicrous to try to appease blacks with the offer of a King holiday
and questioned whether an end to the boycott would lead to
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no discussions or negotiations before we called for
these sanctions, and there wouldn't be any if we withdrew,'' James
said. ``We are committed to standing firm to the end, and it is up
to the leadership of the state to change.''
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP's effort is the latest attempt to remove the flag
since it was put up in 1962 as a gesture of defiance to the civil
rights movement. Most recently, then-Gov. David Beasley led a vocal
campaign in 1997 but the Legislature rejected his proposal to take
down the flag.
</P>
<P>
   James and other proponents of removing the flag see it as a
symbol of slavery, and say the flag's presence over the seat of
government is indicative of the racial climate in the state. Many
Southerners, while acknowledging that the flag has been
appropriated by white hate groups, insist that it is not a racist
symbol, but rather a banner under which many of their relatives
fought and died.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a soldier's flag, and that's why it's wrapped around
those caskets right there,'' said Randy Burbage, president of the
Confederate Heritage Trust, the group that dug up the sailors'
remains from under the stadium and organized the reinterment.
``This is our heritage, and if the flag comes down, then next the
monuments will come down, and then the street names, and then we
will forget our history. We can't forget that this was America's
greatest tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Burbage wept as he helped lower the pine caskets into a long
trench grave at Magnolia Cemetery, which was full of 135-year-old
monuments to fallen rebels. The remains were discovered in June
after the Heritage Trust, working with a state archaeologist,
realized that a cemetery from the 1860s was beneath the stadium,
which was built in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   At Friday's ceremony, each of the flags over the coffins was
carefully folded by re-enactors in Confederate uniforms, and each
was handed to a woman dressed in the black hoop skirt and veil.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the crowd sang ``Dixie,'' the soldiers let loose a rebel
yell and there was a barrage of gunpowder salutes from rifles and
artillery pieces.
</P>
<P>
   One state official looking on let loose a barrage of his own,
his mocking voice a reminder of the deep trench that still divides
the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NAACP doesn't care about the flag, they're just doing this
to raise money,'' said state Sen. Arthur Ravenel, a Republican who
represents the Charleston area. ``I would say that not only will
the state not negotiate under threat of a boycott, but we'll never
vote to take down that flag at all.''

ON TAPE, COLUMBINE KILLER THANKS GUN DEALERS
</HEADLINE>
  
(Adds 11 grafs with details of videotape)  (Eds: Language in 20th graf may be offensive to some readers)

 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOLDEN, Colo. _ In the weeks before the massacre at Columbine
High School, the two teen-age killers made a videotape in which
they chillingly described the act they were about to commit and
assured future viewers that they were acting alone and that no one
knew what they were planning.
</P>
<P>
   Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris thanked two local gun dealers for
helping them obtain the weapons they would later use when they
burst into the school on April 30 and killed 13 people before
killing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to ensure that none of his or Harris' friends or
family members would be charged in the shootings, Klebold, looking
directly into the camera, said: ``Let me tell you this much, they
have no clue. So don't blame them and arrest them for what we
did.''
</P>
<P>
   The remarks by Klebold and others by Harris were revealed Friday
during an emotional hearing in a district court here, where Mark E.
Manes, 22, a computer systems manager, was sentenced to nine years
in prison for selling one of the guns used at Columbine to Klebold.
The sentencing guidelines could have allowed the judge, Henry
Nieto, to impose a prison term twice as long.
</P>
<P>
   Three months ago, Manes pleaded guilty to two felony charges,
selling a handgun to a juvenile and possessing a dangerous weapon.
</P>
<P>
   The judge imposed a sentence of six years for the first charge
and three for the second.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining his decision, Nieto appeared to be balancing the
interests of both the victims and Manes, saying, ``I don't believe
anything we do here today will comfort the victims.'' But referring
to the charge of selling a weapon to a juvenile, he added, ``This
crime demonstrates the maximum harm that can occur from a violation
of this statute.''
</P>
<P>
   Manes spent most of the three-hour hearing seated at the defense
table with his head down. Before Nieto imposed his sentence, Manes
stood and faced him and said, emphatically, he had no idea what
Harris and Klebold were planning when they bought the gun and
practiced shooting it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was horrified,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``There is no way I can adequately express my sorrow
to the families of the victims of Columbine. It is something I will
regret the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The sentencing followed more than an hour of wrenching testimony
by family members of nine of the victims in the shootings, many of
whom characterized Manes as no less guilty of the killings than
Harris and Klebold, and all of whom asked Nieto to impose the
longest sentence possible.
</P>
<P>
   Several broke down and cried as they spoke; and two families
used stirring musical videotaped presentations of their child who
was killed to emphasize the depth of their loss.
</P>
<P>
   In addressing the court, Kristen Townsend, whose sister Lauren
Townsend was gunned down, spoke with tears in her eyes and said:
``I want a full sentence not to seek revenge but to keep some
dignity for my sister's life and her death.''
</P>
<P>
   Some relatives used the opportunity to ask Nieto to send a
message that would discourage future illegal acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court should impose a sentence which will send a message
of deterrence to others who might consider providing dangerous
weapons to youngsters in violation of the law,'' said Betty Cook,
the aunt of another victim, Isaiah Shoels, reading a statement from
the boy's parents, Michael and Vonda.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had our way the defendant would never be allowed on the
streets again. Life is too precious for anyone to contribute in any
manner to the death of another.''
</P>
<P>
   One parent, Thomas Mauser, whose son, Daniel, was killed, said:
``I ask you clearly to make a statement that this will deter other
crimes,'' he said. ``Some would say I am scapegoating Manes for a
terrible crime. But no. I've had to think about that a lot. It is
clear to me what his role is, and his sentence should reflect what
that was.''
</P>
<P>
   In arguing for a maximum penalty, Steven L. Jensen, the
Jefferson County prosecutor, tried to convey to the judge that
absent Manes' relationship with the killers, the tragedy might not
have occurred.
</P>
<P>
   As his only witness, the lead detective in the case, Kate
Battan, recounted the chronology of how the killers, who were 17 at
the time, met Manes at a weekend gun show in January and how he
purchased for Klebold a Tec-9 semiautomatic handgun for $500 and
later _ the day before the killings _ 100 rounds of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Largely through information she obtained from an interview with
Manes, she described the transaction and three trips he and the
killers made to a target-practice range. On one occasion, she said,
Harris exploded ammunition into the trunk of a tree, destroying it,
and said, ``Imagine that in someone's [expletive) brain.''
</P>
<P>
   She also quoted the killers from a videotape that the
authorities found in one of the killer's homes days after the
massacre. It was apparently made sometime between Klebold's
purchase of the Tec-9 and the day of the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   By Ms. Battan's account, the tape was something of a suicide
note in that the two clearly left the impression they would die in
carrying out their deadly mission.
</P>
<P>
   But as a critical component of the taped message, Harris and
Klebold assertively thanked Manes, and another man, Philip Duran,
for helping them obtain the Tec-9.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I'd like to thank you, Mark and Phil,'' Ms. Battan said
Klebold said on the videotape.
</P>
<P>
   And as if to exonerate them from any culpability in the
shootings, Harris said on the tape, according to Ms. Battan,
``Yeah, you know it's not their fault.''
</P>
<P>
   And Klebold asserted that if Manes and Duran had not helped him
and Harris obtain a weapon, ``We would have found someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Duran, who worked at Black Jack Pizza with Harris and Klebold,
was with Manes when the deal for the handgun was made; he also
accompanied them all three times to the shooting range.
</P>
<P>
   He is scheduled to be arraigned in 10 days on the same charges
that Manes faced.
</P>
<P>
   Led through questions by Jensen, Ms. Battan also told the court
how the killers wanted to make it clear that they had hidden their
plans from all their friends and members of their families. As if
speaking from the grave, knowing they would die in the slaughter,
they implored the authorities they need not seek out Manes, Duran
or anyone else for involvement in the shootings to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't blame them or arrest them for what we did,'' Klebold
said on the videotape, according to Ms. Battan. ``Our friends and
family, no one had a clue.''

FIGHT FANS ARE SPLIT BETWEEN SENTIMENT AND SENSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (dw) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ The heavyweight championship unification rematch
between Lennox Lewis and Evander Holyfield at the Thomas and Mack
Center on Saturday night is forcing boxing fans to choose between
their heads and their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   The bettors, who work these things out with their heads, are
picking Lewis, the World Boxing Council champion. But Holyfield,
the World Boxing Association and International Boxing Federation
champion, is the sentimental favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' perceived advantage in this rematch is based on his
performance against Holyfield in their first bout in March at
Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis fought a tactically sound fight, using his jab and reach
advantage to neutralize Holyfield. It seemed Lewis had done enough
to win the bout, but it was ruled a draw when the three judges
differed on what they saw. One judge had Holyfield winning, one
judge had Lewis winning and the third judge had the fight even.
</P>
<P>
   After having watched Holyfield dominate Mike Tyson in two
fights, Holyfield's fans could not have imagined that he would
perform in such lackluster way against Lewis in such a big fight.
It appeared that age was finally catching up on Holyfield, who is
37.
</P>
<P>
   One compelling aspect of the rematch is whether Lewis (34-1-1)
can top his first performance against Holyfield and whether
Holyfield (36-3-1) has enough left to sustain his warrior image.
The main event is expected to begin around midnight on the East
Coast and will be broadcast on pay-per-view by TVKO.
</P>
<P>
   If both boxers fight at their absolute best, many boxing people
believe that Lewis, who is 6 feet 5 inches tall and weighs 242
pounds, will defeat Holyfield, who is 6-2 and 217 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all things are equal, a good big man will always beat a
good small man,'' Emanuel Steward, Lewis' trainer, said.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield said he made several mistakes in the first fight that
he would correct in the rematch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't aggressive enough,'' he said. ``I didn't move my
head. I got hit too much. He controlled the range and I didn't
fight the fight I wanted to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield could not get inside Lewis' jab the last time and
seemed to have no strategy to get around it. Lewis is hard to hit,
because he leans back in his stance, Don Turner, Holyfield's
trainer, said. But that stance also makes it hard for Lewis to land
an effective right hand, Turner said. Holyfield and Turner have
worked on several tactics to get at Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been working on attacking from angles and getting in
close,'' Turner said. ``You can tell him what to do. I can tell him
what to do. Everybody can tell him what to do. But in the final
analysis, he is the one to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the last fight, Lewis attacked Holyfield, calling him a
hypocrite, because Holyfield was espousing his Christian beliefs
while he had had a number of children out of wedlock. That prompted
Holyfield to predict a third-round knockout. After the knockout
failed to occur, Holyfield became frustrated and even thought about
quitting during the fight.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Holyfield has been toying with Lewis' head, because
he wants Lewis to fight in a manner that will be conducive to
Holyfield's style. Holyfield chided Lewis for taking a conservative
approach in the first fight and for not trying harder to knock him
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious that the winners in life that stand out are the
people who take chances,'' Holyfield said. ``Lennox had the perfect
opportunity of a lifetime to be the undisputed heavyweight
champion. He didn't because he didn't want to get caught. We all
might get caught. You have to take chances to be the very best you
can.''
</P>
<P>
   Those were fighting words for Lewis. ``When we go out in the
first round it's going to be fireworks,'' Lewis said. ``I'm going
to go after him in the first round to see what he's got.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis added: ``I think we're going to go after it a bit more.
I'll be right in his face. He's not going to have to look for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The cliche that the style of the fighter makes the fight
actually applies in this case. The styles of Holyfield and Lewis
clashed in the first bout and made for an ugly fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a fighter pressures me and comes forward, it's a lot
easier for me,'' Holyfield said. ``When a guy isn't aggressive, I
get lured into a lazy posture.''
</P>
<P>
   By nature, Lewis is not a foolhardy fighter, and few people
believe he will wade in against Holyfield with reckless abandon.
But even if Lewis does, he said he is not worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evander doesn't knock anyone out with one punch,'' Lewis said.
``He knocks people out with 15 punches. I'm not afraid of his one
punch.''

<P>
   YORBA LINDA, Calif. _ Steve Forbes, the wealthy magazine
publisher and candidate for the Republican presidential nomination,
came to the shrine dedicated to the president who opened modern
diplomatic relations with China Friday and launched a bitter attack
on the Chinese government, saying he would militarily contain the
country and deny it trade relations if it did not moderate its
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   A day after delivering a speech on domestic issues at the Reagan
Library north of Los Angeles, Forbes came to the Richard Nixon
Library and Birthplace in this suburb of strip malls and tract
homes 50 miles southeast of Los Angeles to offer what his staff had
described as a major foreign policy address. But the speech
included almost no mention of Europe or the rest of the globe and
instead involved a series of angry denunciations of China, which he
described as militarily and politically aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   The speech appeared to be part of Forbes' effort to transform
himself from a candidate focused largely on one issue, tax reform,
as had been the case in 1996, to the most conservative candidate in
the presidential race on a range of issues, such as abortion, which
he vigorously opposes, and military expansion, which he supports.
Many conservatives criticize the communist government of China as a
major peril, and Friday Forbes embraced that position
enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes declared, in stark Cold War terms, ``The rise of China as
a new power is one of the greatest challenges we face as a nation
as we enter the 21st century,'' and he compared the country to
Germany and Japan in the years leading up to World War II.
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that, if he were elected, there would be ``no more
leaving our children and our allies vulnerable to Chinese nuclear
missiles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And no more sweetheart trade deals,'' he continued.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is opposed to China's entry into the World Trade
Organization and said he would revoke China's Most Favored Nation
trading trade status if it did not open up politically and end its
military threat to its neighbors, especially Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   In comments after his prepared speech here, Forbes also attacked
the International Monetary Fund, the body formed after World War II
to foster financial stability, and another target of conservative
ire.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have done enormous harm around the globe,'' he said of
the fund, promising to close it down if elected.
</P>
<P>
   The speech Friday was in keeping with the overall tone of
Forbes' campaign, in which he has generally described imminent
threats he says America faces and the ways in which he would
confront those threats.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes characterized China as America's greatest rival, and he
suggested that even while the country was on the verge of what he
described as a political implosion it was pursuing expansionist
designs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In short, China is an immensely important yet intensely
unstable country,'' Forbes said, and he quoted a Chinese dissident
predicting that the communist government would fall within 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that he wanted to strengthen America's military
involvement in Asia, where the country already maintains huge bases
in Japan and South Korea. ``America must be absolutely committed to
remain the premier military power in the Pacific,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes was scornful of the Clinton administration's China
policy, saying that in the president's first term it ``had all the
predictability of a drunk driving on the road.'' He added, ``I call
it a study in confusion and mixed signals, often degenerating into
appeasement.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he would put in place tough sanctions against any
company owned by the Chinese military, companies that use prison
labor and companies that traffic in weapons of mass destruction. If
their behavior does not change, and if China does not halt its
pattern of human rights abuses, particularly what he said is
religious persecution, Forbes promised to cut back on China's
access to American markets.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes described the decade since the protests and killings at
Tiananmen Square as a time ``of drift, indecision and plain bad
judgment'' in which the country has been suffering increasing
instability and a spiritual malaise.
</P>
<P>
   Economists, however, describe it as a time of unparalleled
growth and increasing openness. Nicholas Lardy, a China scholar at
the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., said that while
China has made clear threats at Taiwan, ``the economic reforms have
continued after Tiananmen.''
</P>
<P>
   China's total trade with other countries has nearly tripled, to
about $325 million last year from $112 billion in 1989. In fact,
China's trade surplus with the United States has ballooned to more
than $50 billion this year, as American consumers have become
increasingly dependent on the inexpensive products shipped here
from China.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, foreign investment in China, welcomed by the
Chinese government, has shot up from about $3 billion a year in the
late 1980s to close to $45 billion a year now. The country's
economic growth rate has averaged 8 percent to 10 percent over the
past decade, Lardy said, bringing prosperity to millions of people
in China.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said there was ``a great spiritual awakening going on
behind the Great Wall today,'' and that he would support those
movements and battle the government's religious persecution by
beefing up Radio Free Asia and attempting to create a Web site
focused on China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is the time to intensify our efforts to communicate the
good news of freedom and faith in God to a people living in great
darkness,'' said Forbes.

EXCERPTS FROM FORBES SPEECH ON SECURITY CONCERNS IN ASIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (With FORBES-POLICY.) 
(th) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from the prepared text of a speech that
Steve Forbes made yesterday on United States policy toward China.
The address was given at the Richard Nixon Library in Yorba Linda,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   It is time to set a new course for American foreign policy in
Asia. We need a principled president who will deal with China from
a position of strength. We need a president willing to say to
Beijing in no uncertain terms: No more business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   No more shutting our ears to the cries of Christians, Buddhists
and others suffering religious persecution in Chinese gulags. No
more turning a blind eye to Chinese spies in our nuclear labs. No
more keeping silent about Chinese slave labor camps, forced
abortions and death-factory orphanages. No more doing business with
Chinese military-owned companies trafficking in weapons of mass
destruction. No more leaving our children and our allies vulnerable
to Chinese nuclear missiles. And no more sweetheart trade deals.
</P>
<P>
   I share the American people's sense of frustration that our
security and our values are constantly being trampled by Beijing,
and the Clinton-Gore administration does nothing. It is weak. It is
reactive. It is rudderless _ and it is wrong. ...
</P>
<P>
   Some believe the right course of action is to immediately revoke
most-favored-nation trade status _ a form of ``shock therapy'' _ to
force China to stop its egregious military and human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   And that is an entirely understandable point of view, especially
given the White House's approach of ``hear no evil, see no evil,
speak no evil'' towards Beijing. Indeed, we may very well need to
revoke MFN.
</P>
<P>
   But first we need a real China policy, a tough China policy. We
need Beijing to understand the rules of engagement.
</P>
<P>
   And we need to begin using the economic and diplomatic tools at
our disposal to effect real change in China: tough sanctions on
Chinese military-owned companies; tough sanctions on Chinese
companies using slave labor; tough sanctions on Chinese companies
trafficking in weapons of mass destruction, and continuous,
high-profile condemnations of Chinese human rights abuses in every
international forum possible. ...
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes administration will rebuild _ not run down _ our
national defenses. We will strengthen our alliances with key
countries in the region to counterbalance the Chinese threat.
</P>
<P>
   We will make it clear that we will defend Taiwan from a Chinese
attack. As president, I will sign the bipartisan ``Taiwan Security
Enhancement Act'' offered by Sen. Jesse Helms and Sen. Robert
Torricelli. This will lift restrictions on the sale of defensive
weapons to Taiwan, including missile defense systems.
</P>
<P>
   We will also deploy state-of-the-art missile defense systems,
such as the sea-based Aegis system, to protect our allies and
ourselves. Indeed, we must dramatically step up our research and
development to reopen the technology gap and pull away from our
adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   When a Chinese general made a not-so-veiled threat to ``nuke''
Los Angeles over the Taiwan crisis several years ago, he made one
thing abundantly clear: We must not allow China's growing nuclear
arsenal to continue to threaten American cities and decouple the
United States from our allies. ...

AMID FINANCIAL CRISIS, CHURCH COUNCIL ELECTS NEW LEADERS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif, Pa.)   By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ In the 49 years since its founding, the National
Council of Churches has distinguished itself by strongly supporting
civil rights legislation, helping resettle many thousands of
refugees in the United States and sponsoring two influential Bible
translations that have sold nearly 70 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   But this week, with the organization's leaders meeting here to
celebrate the upcoming golden anniversary, the council faced a
financial crisis and the question of what role it should play in an
ecumenical movement it once helped lead but which has moved far
beyond it.
</P>
<P>
   Signaling a desire to begin a new chapter, the council turned to
new leadership, under two men as well known in the secular world as
they are in religious life.
</P>
<P>
   In the final session of its conference Friday morning, the
council's governing General Assembly elected a new
general-secretary, or top officer, the Rev. Robert W. Edgar, 56, a
United Methodist minister who served in Congress from 1975 to '87
as a Democrat representative from Pennsylvania's historically
Republican 7th District. Edgar, who was named to a four-year term,
was selected by a search committee formed a year ago. Edgar, who
spent the past decade as president of Claremont School of Theology
in Claremont, Calif., will assume the job on Jan. 1, succeeding the
Rev. Joan B. Campbell, who stepped down after two terms.
</P>
<P>
   The previous evening, the council held a worship service to
install Andrew Young, the former U.S. representative to the United
Nations and an ordained United Church of Christ minister, as the
council's new president. The service took place in Cleveland's
Roman Catholic Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist, with the call
to worship led by Bishop Anthony M. Pilla, and it offered a
tantalizing vision of how broad the ecumenical movement might be in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The council represents only a partial vision of American
Christianity, with 35 member denominations _ mainline Protestant,
predominately African-American and Eastern Orthodox. It does not
include Roman Catholic, among other churches.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Edgar said the council had a ``fairly clear
vision'' of itself in its first three decades, especially in the
1960s when the struggle for civil rights for black Americans was at
its height. Since then, he said, the council has ``done good work,
but has been invisible at the local level.''
</P>
<P>
   Edgar said he would like to help the council offer greater
support and encouragement in cooperation to local councils of
churches. He also said he wanted to ask the member denominations
what they thought the ecumenical movement could be and ``then shape
the NCC to meet that need.''
</P>
<P>
   Edgar arrived at Claremont in 1990, when he said the school's
endowment had been reduced to less than $4 million, from more than
$7 million. He will leave the school, he said, with the endowment
at $22 million, several buildings renovated and the budget
balanced.
</P>
<P>
   Such experience would seem vital in taking charge of the
council. The organization is facing a deficit estimated at $3.5
million in an annual budget of nearly $70 million, a shortage
officials say that resulted largely from the expense of an
examination by outside consultants and a recommended overhaul of
the council's financial operations.
</P>
<P>
   Concern among denominations over the council's financial
management peaked this fall when the United Methodist Church, a
major contributor, said it would withhold a payment of more than
$300,000 until the council had its fiscal house in order. The money
is still being withheld.
</P>
<P>
   Council officials say the staff will be reduced through
elimination of vacant positions, attrition through retirements and
layoffs. It is a course that would echo cuts made earlier this
decade by several major Protestant churches at their national
headquarters, as they struggled with their own financial crises.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Campbell, general-secretary since 1991, said she thought
part of the council's problem, shared by many national
denominations, resulted from a trend within organized religion, as
Americans increasingly prefer to see their donations go to causes
at a local level or to a specific need, such as help for victims of
a natural disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our system, we have very modest _ and less and less _
unrestricted money'' for general operations, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Wes Granberg-Michelson, general-secretary of the
Reformed Church in America and a chairman of a committee formed to
help the council restructure itself financially, said that while no
one should underestimate ``the sense of crisis'' within the
organization, the council's leaders had nonetheless reached a
consensus this week on steps to turn this around. They should put
the council on a sound financial basis, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the council's difficulties might also lie in the very
success of promoting understanding and cooperation among the
different faiths. Rather than a single, centralized organization
like the council leading the movement, important ecumenical work is
now being carried on by churches at the local level, and by
denominations that forge formal ties with each other. There is also
a wider cast of potential partners for ecumenical efforts than
there was 50 years ago, particularly among Catholics, evangelical
Protestants and Pentecostals.
</P>
<P>
   Another ecumenical organization attempting a transition to a new
era, the World Council of Churches, is further along in the
process. It is also a half-century old and now represents nearly
340 denominations. Both the National and World Councils were
founded largely by Protestants in a bygone era when their churches
were dominant religious forces in their societies.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Konrad Raiser, the World Council's general-secretary,
said in an interview this week that that organization had been
trying to shift its center of gravity and adopt a broader vision,
so that its member churches _ not the organization's own agencies _
set the agenda, while it reaches out to other Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really matters is to look at the council as a fellowship
of churches,'' he said, referring to the World Council. ``Our
earlier understanding was very much focused around the council as
an advocate of issues, an initiator of programs that were in some
ways seen as a challenge to the churches.''

 &HT;    Lawmakers: Word of Lockheed Martin closings just speculation
 &HT;    EDs: EMBARGOED for Sunday, Nov. 14, 1999
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When a company the size of Lockheed Martin Corp.
signals that it is considering shutting down operations in a
particular state, it usually stirs up a hornet's nest of worry
among lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   But when Georgia's congressional delegation learned that
Lockheed's Marietta, Ga., facility may be in danger of closing, the
reaction was nearly uniform: It's just speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a rumor,'' said Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.), who
represents the district where the plant is located. ``We've been
dealing with this kind of speculation for years and it has proven
false in each case.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Lockheed
is thinking about selling or eliminating some of its core
military-aircraft operations, including the Marietta plant, Georgia
Republican Sen. Paul Coverdell's staffers were on the phone with
Lockheed officials. Coverdell himself followed up with a phone call
later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell, a member of the Senate Republican leadership, was
reassured.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our perspective, every arrow is pointing in the other
way,'' said Laura Cox, Coverdell's communications director. ``The
company has taken measures to streamline and increase the
efficiency at the Marietta plant and the senator is confident that
those measures will ensure its viability.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Sen. Max Cleland, a member of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, said he was not surprised by the news. Rumors
have been circulating about the Marietta plant for as long as he
can remember.
</P>
<P>
   But Cleland said that Lockheed would not have been forced into
considering such actions if the House had not ``played mischief''
with funding for the F-22 fighter jet program.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Calif.), chairman of the House panel
overseeing military spending, nearly succeeded in eliminating
funding to start building the aircraft next year, saying the planes
were too expensive and untested.
</P>
<P>
   The F-22 program is now about $500 million short of Lockheed's
funding goal, which Cleland said is the reason for budget cuts in
the C-130J program. The C-130Js cargo planes are almost entirely
built at the Marietta facility. The F-22 is partially assembled at
the plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically the House told Lockheed, `We'll build the planes,
but you have to take it out of your own hide,''' Cleland said.
``The House action caused the entire Congress to borrow from Peter
to pay Paul.''
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the lack of concern displayed by the Georgia delegation
is the palpable belief that the Marietta plant would not be facing
such near-death experiences if former House Speaker Newt Gingrich
were still at the helm or if former Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn were
still in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Gingrich would have reigned in Lewis,'' Cleland said.
</P>
<P>
   And even Lewis himself has said that the F-22 program would not
have been put in jeopardy had Gingrich been around.
</P>
<P>
   The real question now is what will the Georgia lawmakers do to
ensure that the so-called ``rumor'' does not become fact.
</P>
<P>
   Cleland said that he has brokered a deal to sell about a
half-dozen C-130Js to the Kuwaiti government with the hope of
keeping the plant ``warm'' until the Air Force starts buying the
cargo planes in large numbers starting in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Cleland said the deal would be announced in January. He also
said that the Italian government has expressed an interest in
purchasing four of the cargo planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to keep the line warm,'' Cleland said. If Lockheed
closes down the Marietta plant and the government needs C-130Js in
2002, it would cost an estimated $680 million to crank up the
operations again.
</P>
<P>
   And even if Georgia is missing some of the clout it once had in
Congress, lawmakers say they will lobby hard to keep anything from
happening to the Marietta plant.
</P>
<P>
   They note that they pulled together as a bipartisan coalition to
win funding for the F-22 against the formidable opposition mounted
by Lewis and they predict they can do it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can diminish the influence Gingrich had as the speaker
of the House, nor can they diminish Sam Nunn's role on Armed
Services, but that doesn't mean that there hasn't been a
significant contribution by the Georgia delegation,'' said Rep.
Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.)
</P>
<P>
   When a newspaper ran an article two months ago questioning the
future of the Marietta plant, Isakson spoke to Lockheed officials
and they emphatically told him that there were no plans to shut
down the facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen the (Wall Street Journal) article and it names
unnamed sources, which I am not a big fan of,'' Isakson said.
``They've told me that there are no plans to close Marietta and I
take them at their word.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) said he was ``shocked'' to hear that the
Marietta plant might be in trouble. Just last week, he met with the
president of the Marietta plant and a group of Lockheed lobbyists.
There was no mention of it, and, in fact, the group was
enthusiastic about the Marietta operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be news to me and news to our delegation,'' Lewis
said. ``We've worked too hard for Lockheed and its employees for
there to be any consideration of moving it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lockheed plant is critical to the entire Southeast, Lewis
said, noting that its employees come from Alabama and South
Carolina in addition to Georgia. ``It would be hard for me to
believe that they would do this without telling us.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), a member of the House Armed
Services Committee, said he found it hard to believe, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force has said they plan to buy 339 F-22s and 150
C-130Js.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps has testified that they need 51 C-130Js,
Chambliss said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given this commitment, it is obvious that the C-130J and F-22
programs are critical for our nation and our national security,''
Chambliss said.
</P>
<P>
   Chambliss cast doubt on the news article, noting that the
workers in Georgia who build the aircraft are some of the most
highly skilled and highly trained in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this quality work force, in addition to the low cost of
doing business, there is no better place than Georgia for
production of these airplanes,'' Chambliss said. ``As a member of
the House Armed Services Committee, I remain committed and
supportive of these vital defense programs.''

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 14)  
 (af)  
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One recent afternoon, Mel Karmazin, the chairman and
chief executive of CBS, stormed through the office of the network's
late founder, William S. Paley, on the 35th floor of Black Rock,
the CBS headquarters in Midtown Manhattan, and collapsed into a
chair in the adjoining conference room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a busy day,'' he said, fiddling with his silk tie in
a gesture of mock fatigue. ``First I worked on Letterman's
monologue. Then I wrote all of Howard Stern's jokes for tomorrow.
And then, I programmed all the radio stations.''
</P>
<P>
   No one present _ Karmazin's public relations envoy, a reporter
and a secretary standing at the door _ cracked a smile. It seemed
almost plausible.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Karmazin, a former radio advertising salesman
who next year will become the chief operating officer of
Viacom-CBS, one of the world's largest producers of news and
entertainment, was virtually unknown outside the tiny, tightknit
radio industry. Now he is the putative heir to Sumner M. Redstone,
76, Viacom's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Yet already Karmazin is talking about rising further. ``When
Jack Welch retires,'' he said, referring to John F. Welch Jr., the
chairman of General Electric, which owns the rival NBC, ``I plan to
buy NBC.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not necessarily kidding. He said he believed that
Washington could be persuaded to further deregulate the media
industry, especially as television audiences continued to migrate
to cable channels.
</P>
<P>
   And this is not the first time since the Viacom-CBS merger was
announced in September that Karmazin has gone window-shopping:
according to several reports, he has his eye on America Online as
an acquisition candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But Karmazin's all-consuming aspirations raise several
questions. What exactly has he accomplished in his three years at
CBS? Is his background in advertising broad enough to run not only
a network, always considered a public trust, but also a
soon-to-be-merged company that will have an $80 billion market
capitalization and revenues of $19 billion from movies,
broadcasting, cable, publishing and music networks?
</P>
<P>
   Put bluntly, can Viacom-CBS be run successfully by a man who has
never seen a television pilot, has rarely made programming
decisions and has never supervised creative people on a daily
basis? Will his methods of bone-deep cost-cutting and micromanaging
work at a company the size of Viacom-CBS? And just what is he
thinking about the future of the lightning-paced media industry?
</P>
<P>
   Karmazin, who leads a quiet life for a media mogul, is a
reluctant celebrity, uncomfortable speaking about himself. He is,
for example, reputed to be a voracious reader, but when asked about
his choices, he snapped: ``I'm not going to tell you what books I
read. I'm not Oprah. Oprah, you should care about what books she
reads. If I were going to form a book club and make lots of money
off it, then I would tell you what books I read.''
</P>
<P>
   (His example shows that he is not a man to miss an opportunity
for free promotion. King World _ the distributor of ``The Oprah
Winfrey Show'' _ agreed to merge with CBS seven months ago in a
stock swap valued at $2.5 billion.)
</P>
<P>
   When Karmazin does talk about himself, he sometimes seems
awkward, more like a hyperactive 10-year-old boy than a 56-year-old
chief executive. He hates to sleep, saying: ``Why sleep? It's too
boring.'' So it's not surprising that he rises at 4:30 a.m.,
without an alarm clock, and rarely takes a vacation, despite owning
a beach house at the Jersey Shore.
</P>
<P>
   But his history gives some clues about what he will do at
Viacom-CBS, an entity that Karmazin fondly calls the ``largest
advertising platform in the world,'' where he will split duties
with Redstone. It is an advertising behemoth, he has said, that
guarantees ``unprecedented cross-promotional opportunities around
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   For Karmazin, stock price is an obsession, ``shareholder value''
a mantra he often drops into conversation, and advertising is king.
</P>
<P>
   Karmazin's roots in advertising go way back. He grew up in Long
Island City, Queens, and attended P.S. 1 there. His mother worked
in a factory while his father drove a taxi. During high school,
Karmazin was a typist at an ad agency in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Universally known as Mel (reporters who use his full name,
Melvin Alan, receive a phone call from a CBS spin doctor with this
reprimand: ``Ted Turner is not Theodore Turner. Walt Disney is not
Walter Disney. And Mel Karmazin is not Melvin.''), Karmazin
attended Pace University at night while he worked as an advertising
salesman by day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only day I stayed awake in college was the lecture about
Supply and Demand 101,'' he said. His first CBS job, at $17,500 a
year, was selling ads for the radio division. In the late 1960s,
when his commission exceeded $70,000, his boss balked at his cut;
Karmazin soon left to work for John W. Kluge at Metromedia, the
broadcasting company. He married, had two children _ his son owns a
small radio broadcasting company in Wisconsin _ and, a few years
ago, divorced.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcast advertising sales creates a particularly aggressive,
jumpy kind of sales representative, said Norman Pattiz, an old
friend who is chairman of Westwood One, the largest radio network
in the country and the country's largest supplier of local traffic
and news to radio stations. (CBS owns 13 percent of the company's
stock and controls 10 percent of the voting power.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't sell yesterday's time,'' he explained. ``So it
creates a very intense kind of person. You need to know two things
to be a great salesperson. You need to know the business, which Mel
does. And you need to ingratiate yourself to the people you are
doing business with. And Mel does that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Karmazin was the chief executive of the Infinity
Broadcasting Co., which then owned 44 radio stations around the
country. He had taken Infinity public in 1992 for $17.50 a share,
then sold it to CBS in 1996 for $170 a share, securing his
reputation on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   That year, using a business strategy that has since become his
trademark, Karmazin approached CBS, which merged with Westinghouse
in 1995, and proposed that Infinity buy the company. Instead, CBS
acquired Infinity for $4.9 billion that June, and Karmazin came
aboard to run the combined radio operations of Infinity,
Westinghouse and CBS, along with its outdoor advertising business.
</P>
<P>
   Intent on making his stamp on the company, he was instrumental
in persuading Westinghouse to dump its industrial manufacturing
assets and to refashion the company under the CBS name.
</P>
<P>
   Michael H. Jordan, then chairman and chief executive of CBS,
appointed him to head CBS's station division. Karmazin rose quickly
_ so quickly that in October 1998 he forced Jordan's resignation,
assuming his titles in January. (A spokeswoman for Jordan, who runs
an Internet company in Pittsburgh, said he would not comment.)
</P>
<P>
   If Jordan did not sense it, others saw Karmazin's ambitions.
``He is always comfortable saying: `I don't have to control
everything. Just let me run it.' Once he runs it, his performance
allows him to control it,'' Pattiz said. ``I heard somebody
describe him one time by saying, `Mel is completely without guile.
He'll never stab you in the back. He'll stab you in the chest.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that's true,'' Karmazin said, hearing the analysis. ``I
will be totally honest with you _ even if you might not like what I
have to say.''
</P>
<P>
   But Don Imus, the radio personality whom Karmazin installed more
than 10 years ago at WFAN, one of Infinity's 163 radio stations,
knows him well _ and said he believed that Karmazin, whom he
described as ``a cross between Lenny Bruce and Don Rickles,'' had
no strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think he goes from one point to the next with no
master plan,'' Imus said. ``I think his goal is to try to get CBS
stock to 100.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, since Karmazin's arrival, CBS stock has more than
tripled, from a low of $15.375 in July 1996 to a close of $51.8125
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Reif Cohen, a media analyst at Merrill Lynch who is one
of many loyal Mel Karmazin hagiographers on Wall Street, also said
he is single-minded. ``He is focused on one thing: bringing the
stock up,'' she said. ``Sumner can do the strategic visionary
thing, and Mel can be the behind-the-scenes operator, pushing the
stock, and that's what he will do.''
</P>
<P>
   When Karmazin arrived at CBS, his goals were few but clear: cut
costs and raise revenues so that the stock moves relentlessly
higher. To the dismay of many in the news division, he has cut
spending on the evening news _ as all three networks have done in
recent years _ even as he has invested $30 million to $50 million
in a potentially risky morning program, ``The Early Show;'' it made
its debut on Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The rationale is simple. The highest-rated morning program,
NBC's ``Today,'' generated $150 million in advertising revenue last
year. CBS's previous morning offering had only about one-fourth
that amount.
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder that at the ``CBS Evening News,'' Karmazin is
vilified as the man who has continued cuts that began under
Laurence A. Tisch, the chairman of CBS from 1986 to 1996, whom news
staff members felt had financially handcuffed the news division.
</P>
<P>
   According to CBS executives, the ``CBS Evening News,'' under a
reorganization instituted by Karmazin, has continued to reduce its
number of camera crews. CBS executives refer to it as surgery, not
an amputation, but will not say how many news crews the network
has, though they acknowledge that the total is far below the 125
crews fielded by NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Karmazin makes no apologies. ``We've been pretty good at
watching expenses,'' he said. ``And we're pretty good at generating
revenues. We've always been known to make huge investments in
properties that are worth it.'' For example, Howard Stern, the
shock jock Karmazin hired at WNEW, reportedly has a salary of $20
million a year; Imus makes at least $6 million, and Leslie Moonves,
the president and chief executive of CBS Television, got a raise to
$6 million, from $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Karmazin added: ``You know, I'm real comfortable getting my own
cup of coffee. I don't need a kitchen staff. I'd rather put that
money on the screen or in radio, not to behind-the-scenes stuff
that is about making my life more comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   After slashing $180 million from the CBS budget last year,
Karmazin has raised revenue. Ad revenue climbed after he and
Moonves started preaching to advertisers that CBS's viewers, while
older than those of other networks, were a wealthier and thus
better demographic group. But it is unclear whether ad revenue rose
because of the demographic push or because of a healthy economy and
a big surge in Internet advertising, of which Karmazin said CBS has
managed to garner a majority.
</P>
<P>
   CBS's ad rates have increased: for the 1999-2000 season, NBC
remains the most expensive with an average unit rate _ the cost for
a 30-second prime-time spot _ of $171,114, a drop of around 9
percent from the previous year, according to a survey by
Advertising Age published each fall. ABC has an average rate of
$165,773, down 3.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But CBS, though still in third place, has managed a 27 percent
increase, to an average unit rate of $163,773.
</P>
<P>
   Karmazin's other trick at CBS was to put the sales force on
commission, without salary, a measure instituted two years ago and
noted throughout the industry.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That is not punitive, he said. ``The purpose of it is to have
them on your side, so the salespeople don't sit there and say,
`Hey, I did all this work and the big guys get all the money.''' He
recently told CBS radio advertising sales managers that he expected
to present a sales representative with a $1 million annual paycheck
_ a first _ someday soon.
</P>
<P>
   His advice to the sales staff is: ``Don't give me lame excuses
like, `Oh, Mel, but our ratings are down, wah, wah.' Or, `there's
no activity.' Your job is to create activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, Karmazin is not a man given to romantic notions
about network history. He has said he will sell the network, which
analysts say has lost money every year since the mid-1980s , if he
cannot make it profitable. (This year, he says it will be
profitable.) Asked if he ever senses the presence of Paley's spirit
in his office, he said: ``His ghost? Well, if it makes a better
story for you, sure I feel Paley's ghost.''Then he wiggled his
fingers, raised his eyebrows and said, playfully, ``Whoooo!''
</P>
<P>
   Befitting a man who thinks first of a network as a billboard,
not the home of ``60 Minutes'' _ once even betting Tom Wolzien, a
media analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, Wolzien's salary that he
could sell the network for more than it was worth _ Karmazin spends
little time worrying about programming. ( Karmazin replies: ``Oh,
that was a chump-change bet anyway.'') He depends on the executives
in programming to report to him on an almost-daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mel once said, `The day that Leslie Moonves asks my opinion
about programming is the day I sell all my CBS stock,''' Moonves
said. ``That's flattering, but it says a lot about our
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Stringer, chairman of the Sony Corporation of America and
a former president of CBS, said that was Karmazin's style. ``He is
smart to know what he does not know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When he moves to the merged Viacom-CBS, Karmazin is expected to
approach his management duties with similar tactics, if Redstone
lets him run the show. By most accounts, the pair's engagement
joins two like-minded men from similar backgrounds in a mission to
generate more advertising revenue than any other company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are kindred spirits,'' Redstone said. ``Neither one of us
was born with a golden spoon in his mouth. We're both entrepreneurs
at heart and we're both driven by the same motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there has already been a tense moment. Last month, the
two appeared to differ over Blockbuster, Viacom's ailing video
rental chain. One day, Karmazin told analysts that it would be best
to spin it off, but later that week, in a conference call with
reporters, Redstone shot back that Blockbuster was ``not a sick
child.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a booming, thriving business,'' he said, quashing rumors
that he would sell it.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Karmazin said he had a few concrete plans for the
day the merger is approved by the Federal Communications
Commission. For one, he wants to integrate music units of Viacom _
MTV and VH1 _ with CBS's radio, advertising and Internet entities
in a Web site or series of Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's assume that the American consumer likes music,'' he
said. ``And let's say that music might be something that might be
on the Internet. Take our radio stations. Take MTV and VH1, and
that's a pretty compelling site. You're able to drive traffic to it
because you've got all these billboards and forms of advertising,
and I think that's all pretty compelling.''
</P>
<P>
   He also intends to scrutinize the children's programming
business. ``There are interesting opportunities that are still
hypothetical,'' he said. ``But they have a lot of children's
programming. What if our networks wanted to run some children's
programming? That might not be a bad idea.'' He added that
Infinity's radio stations might be a great fit for MTV and VH1 in
terms of concert promotion.
</P>
<P>
   The merger also fulfills Karmazin's longtime desire to own cable
properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until now, CBS didn't have any cable, and that was a
problem,'' he said. ``And now we have cable. We didn't have a major
studio and now we have a studio.''
</P>
<P>
   None of this will quell the objections raised when the merger
was announced, especially from vocal critics in the advertising
industry. Because the merger will meld the CBS network, CBS
television stations, radio stations and billboards with Viacom's
MTV, VH1 and Nickelodeon and the company's stake in the UPN
network, some fear that the consolidation will allow Viacom-CBS to
charge excessive rates and unfairly corner some advertising
markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think what Mel is doing is good for the country,''
said Jean Pool, executive vice president and director for North
American media services at J. Walter Thompson in New York. ``I
don't think monopolies are good for the country or the economy. Mel
is like the robber barons at the turn of the century. And you
remember what happened to the oil business and the railroad
business at the turn of the last century. They became terrible
monopolies that were eventually broken up.''
</P>
<P>
   Karmazin said the new company would ``not have, quote, unfair
leverage with any constituency at all.'' He added: ``Wherever
advertisers want to spend their money, we're going to be there.
We're indifferent to where they spend their money, as long as they
spend it with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pool said she did not expect the new company to increase any
ad rates before the Senate antitrust subcommittee and the FC C
approved the deal. ``I am sure Mel is half-joking when he says he
wants to buy NBC,'' Ms. Pool said, ``but if that is his dream, he
is going to have to be a good boy and at least look as if he is
behaving himself.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Jon Mandel, co-managing director of Mediacom, the media services
arm of Grey Advertising, said the merger's so-called synergy _
extolled by Karmazin and Redstone _ was nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no natural fit between Viacom and CBS that makes
sense,'' Mandel said, noting that audiences watching ``60 Minutes''
were not also watching MTV. He had one exception: ``If you look at
music, however, there is a tremendous fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandel said the most fundamental issue with the Viacom-CBS deal
would be ``if Mel ever tries to change the programming.''
</P>
<P>
   At CBS, the closest Karmazin ever came to that occurred when Don
Hewitt, the producer of ``60 Minutes,'' and Mike Wallace, one of
the program's correspondents, appealed to him in 1998 to not go
forward with a plan put forward by Moonves and Andrew Heyward, the
president of CBS News, for ``60 Minutes II.''
</P>
<P>
   One CBS executive said that Hewitt and Wallace begged Karmazin
to quash the show, but that Karmazin listened and said, ``Sorry
guys, but I'm not going to override Andrew and Leslie.''
</P>
<P>
   According to another executive, the encounter had Karmazin
barking: ``We're putting on `60 Minutes II' whether you like it or
not. If I have to slap the title `60 Minutes II' across `The
Nanny,' I'll do it, but you're going to have `60 Minutes II.''' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In either case, it was a good move: ``60 Minutes II,'' despite
its low ratings with younger audiences, is ranked 24th in Nielsen
ratings, after ABC's ``Dharma and Greg'' and NBC's ``Law and Order:
Special Victims Unit.'' Karmazin smiled and said only this: `` `The
Nanny?' Does that sound like me? I think the team at ``60 Minutes''
was concerned. I was pleased that they cared so much about the
brand name.''
</P>
<P>
   Karmazin is notoriously tough with staff, and has become only
tougher.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he likes you, it would be great to work for him,'' Ms.
Cohen said. ``If he doesn't, it would be a nightmare.'' And his
style is famously brusque.
</P>
<P>
   One former CBS executive said he once attended a meeting with
Karmazin and Fred Drasner, then the co-publisher of The Daily News
of New York. After the meeting, according to this account, Karmazin
stood at the elevator, looked at the CBS executive, and said: ``The
day I fire you, the company's stock will go up $2.'' (Karmazin
fired him a few months later.)
</P>
<P>
   Some people who know Karmazin say an early career humiliation is
at the heart of his intensity. In the late 1960s, Karmazin, then at
WCBS Radio, tried to get a job at WCBS television. ``CBS was
dominated by a bunch of guys who were in the job because they
looked good and went to the right schools,'' another executive
said. ``The network business was great. O and O's were big. Cable
was still far over the horizon.'' (In TV jargon, ``O and O'' refers
to stations that are owned and operated by a network.)
</P>
<P>
   Karmazin, though, ``wore the wide lapels and the hair going out
in 18 different directions, his tie undone,'' this executive said.
``He came off as a street tough. And I believe that he was rejected
on a cultural basis.'' Karmazin still wants to prove them wrong,
the executive said.
</P>
<P>
   Karmazin's spokesman said he had no comment about the story.
</P>
<P>
   Ascending at Viacom-CBS would, of course, be the ultimate
payback. Karmazin said he had no intention of trying to oust
Redstone. But a provision of the merger was that if Redstone were
to step down, Karmazin would become chief executive of Viacom-CBS.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that was to satisfy the board members,'' Karmazin said.
The two are paid identically, but Redstone also retains the right,
until 2003, to dismiss Karmazin, which doesn't seem to bother him
at all.
</P>
<P>
   At a dinner meeting with analysts last week, Karmazin said that
whether he and Redstone are friendly is ``immaterial,'' stressing
instead the assets of the combination. ``But,'' he added, ``I
expect to be here in 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Redstone said: ``And so do I!''
</P>
<P>
   Karmazin had little to say about Viacom's movie and book
business, but those who know him said he would keep his hands off
unless profits eroded.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is it that I would want this job for?'' he asked. ``I
enjoy running my company. I like hands-on operations. I don't like
the visibility.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added: ``I'm very conscious of the fact that I wasn't
successful as a kid. I wasn't making a lot of money. I didn't come
from a rich family. I was comfortable in that lifestyle. But having
all this stuff _ people coming up to you, being in the public eye _
is more, well, unusual for me. I don't enjoy it.''

 By PHILIP SHENON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton met Friday with Indonesia's new
president, Abdurrahman Wahid, and said that the United States was
willing to open talks aimed at resuming military ties between the
two nations, which were broken off by Washington several weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton praised Wahid, a respected Islamic cleric who was
elected last month in the most democratic balloting ever seen in
Indonesia, and said his election would lead to efforts ``to
strengthen our relationship, including the issue of
military-to-military ties.''
</P>
<P>
   While saying he was ``very encouraged'' by Wahid's election and
his efforts to promote democracy in the world's
fourth-most-populous nation, Clinton stopped short of endorsing the
Indonesian leader's call for a pardon for former President Suharto,
his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto, who ran Indonesia for more than three decades, is under
investigation over allegations that he and his family stole
billions of dollars from the Indonesian treasury and stashed the
money abroad.
</P>
<P>
   After arriving in Washington on Thursday, Wahid, who had been a
leading critic of Suharto during his presidency, told a group of
American business executives and diplomats that he had decided to
pardon Suharto if he is convicted of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid said Friday that one factor in his decision was that
Suharto's ``big followers'' might try to ``topple the cart'' _ an
apparent reference to the possibility that military officers loyal
to Suharto might seek to overthrow the new democratically elected
government.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said of the offer of a pardon: ``I think the decision,
first of all, is one for the Indonesian people and government to
make. I think every country has to decide how to resolve the
tension between the pursuit of a particular case and the desire for
the reconciliation of people, and to go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Washington would support Wahid and ``anything that he's
trying to do to build democracy to take Indonesia into the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States severed military ties with Indonesia after
that country's soldiers were accused of orchestrating the violence
that followed the independence referendum last August in East
Timor, a former Portuguese colony that was invaded by Indonesia in
1975 and annexed the following year. Voters in the referendum
overwhelmingly sought independence for East Timor, which is now
under the control of an international peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the American people know that a strong and stable and
prosperous and democratic Indonesia is very much in our interest,''
Clinton said at a news conference with Wahid before Friday's White
House meeting. ``I think we have to acknowledge that it's quite a
challenging task to preserve a democracy so widespread and so
diverse.''
</P>
<P>
   The nearly blind 78-year-old Indonesian leader, who appeared
full of energy and good humor despite reports of recent ill health,
said he had traveled to Washington ``to make sure that we are still
great friends of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked by reporters about his promise of a pardon for Suharto, he
said, ``We will use law of course, and we would like to know
whether he is guilty or not, according to the law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But after that, we will pardon him because of two reasons,''
he said. ``First is that he was our president, and we have to be
careful about this for future generations. Second thing is that,
you know, that it's not easy, because Suharto still has big
followers. So we have to be careful not to, let's say, topple the
cart.''

JUDGE DENIES CUSTODY TO MOTHER OF SWITCHED BABY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A woman whose baby was switched at birth with
another infant was denied custody of her child Friday, but the
judge in the case granted the mother's request for visitation
rights.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling in a Virginia court means that Rebecca Chittum, 4,
will continue to be reared by Larry and Rosa Chittum of Buena
Vista, Va., and not by her biological mother, Paula Johnson of
Ruckersville, Va., about 75 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   But Judge John Curry II of Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court
said Ms. Johnson could visit Rebecca at least one weekend a month,
on holidays and for three weeks in the summer. ``This is all I ever
wanted, just to be part of her life,'' Ms. Johnson said. Her
lawyer, Ken Mergenthal, said the ruling was ``a great relief for
all of these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry and Rosa Chittum, who have been rearing Rebecca as their
granddaughter since the death of her presumed parents, were also
pleased, their lawyer said Friday night. ``Things couldn't have
worked out any better for my clients,'' said the lawyer, Michael
Groot.
</P>
<P>
   Curry ruled after a psychologist said Rebecca would be better
off if left with the Chittums.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Johnson, who is unmarried, gave birth at the University of
Virginia Medical Center on June 29, 1995. About a year later, she
sought child support from the man she believed had fathered the
child she had named Callie. Tests showed that the man was not
Callie's father and that Ms. Johnson was not her mother.
</P>
<P>
   The medical center then tested Rebecca, who had been born at
about the same time. She was being reared by the Chittums as their
granddaughter. Her presumed parents, Kevin Chittum and his
girlfriend, Tamara Rogers, were killed in a car crash in mid-1998
without knowing of the confusion over the babies.
</P>
<P>
   The tests soon established that Callie was the daughter of Kevin
Chittum and Tamara Rogers and Rebecca was Ms. Johnson's daughter.
Investigations have not determined how the babies were switched.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The most explosive issues remaining in the budget
battle are legislative land mines pitting business interests
against environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the White House and Congress try to strike a final deal,
new pro-business, anti-environmental measures are appearing,
including one that seeks to block the government from collecting
millions of dollars in fines from power companies it says are
defying clean-air laws.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have dug in so deeply on these fights over land, air,
water and money that some members of Congress fear the defeat of
the spending bills to which the measures have been attached, a step
that could cripple efforts to compromise on the budget and prevent
a government shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   The last days of any congressional session are a kind of
witching hour, when amendments like the power companies' proposed
measure can appear suddenly, sometimes seemingly out of nowhere.
Political deals cut in private materialize as fine print in a
thousand-page bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know what phoenix will come up out of the ashes over
the weekend,'' Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The spending bills must eventually be passed to keep the
government going, but Congress could stiill continue to extend its
deadline, as it already has three times. As the last legislation
this year, they can carry politically sensitive material that would
not usually pass the normal checks.
</P>
<P>
   These include the measures known as riders, so called because
they are about unrelated, limited issues attached to the spending
bills.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has already put two dozen environmental riders on the
$15 billion Interior Department spending bill. President Clinton,
threatening a veto, called the riders ``a stealth attack on the
environment'' and said he would send the bill ``straight back to
the recycling bin'' unless they were removed.
</P>
<P>
   One of the new measures, which has not yet found a sponsor,
would stymie the Justice Department's efforts to fine power
companies for modernizing plants without modernizing pollution
controls, as required by clean-air laws.
</P>
<P>
   The power companies want to block the Environmental Protection
Agency from collecting millions of dollars in fines it wants to
impose on 32 coal-fired plants in the Midwest and the South. The
plants' emissions are blamed for acid rain in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   The Edison Electric Institute, the trade association of
investor-owned utilities that generate three-fourths of the
nation's electricity, is leading the charge to persuade Congress to
add a last-minute amendment written by the power companies.
</P>
<P>
   It appealed for ``legislative relief'' in a letter sent on
Wednesday to the most powerful members of Congress. A senior
official of the institute said Friday that he thought a senator
would sponsor the amendment in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Four Republicans _ Reps. Sherwood Boehlert and Rick Lazio of New
York, Michael Castle of Delaware and Wayne Gilchrest of Maryland _
said in a letter sent on Thursday to Hastert that the power
companies' bid was ``a blatant effort'' to protect plants that
``spew out pollutants that create ozone, haze and acid rain'' in
the towns and cities they represent.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Weiss, the political director of the Sierra Club, called the
power companies' move ``an unbelievable assault on efforts to
control smog and acid rain.''
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency sued the utilities on Nov.
3, accusing them of failing to make 17 plants abide by tough new
standards. The proposed amendment would block $27,500-per-day
penalties from piling up against the plants while the power
companies seek to settle the suit. At the same time, the agency
took administrative action against 15 other plants.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Bailey, the Edison Electric Institute's vice president of
environmental issues, said in an interview: ``Utilities are stuck
between a rock and a hard place. State law requires them to provide
reliable service. They're getting this message from the EPA saying
they're being fined for operating in violation of the clean-air
laws. If the government would give us the absolute assurance they
can continue operating, that would solve it.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Congress understands the problem we're facing, and
they're trying to help us find a solution to it right now. There
are efforts right now to craft the right legislative language.
There are some potential sponsors'' in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In the earlier riders attached to spending bills, Republican
senators took steps to allow more logging in national forests and
to let mining companies dump thousands of tons of waste on federal
land. Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., wants to allow coal miners to keep
dumping slag into streams.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, wants to delay new rules
requiring oil companies to pay royalties the government says they
owe. Another new measure cropped up on Thursday. It would delay
until the next administration takes power a new rule that Clinton
has proposed to block new roads in 40 million acres of national
forest.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and Congress continued to negotiate Friday over
the environmental riders by telephone and fax. Both sides have
proposed compromises, but neither side has agreed. A White House
official said Friday that he did not know if compromise was
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Any one of these riders could derail the five remaining spending
bills when they come to the floor in the House and the Senate next
week, both Republicans and Democrats in Congress said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The environmental riders are still hanging out there,'' said
Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin, the ranking Democrat on the House
Appropriations Committee. ``Some members will die over those.
Others will die if they're attached.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say they plan to lash all five bills into a single
$390 billion juggernaut. That means that every objection that every
member has to every issue within the bill will be concentrated into
one vote to support that omnibus measure or let it fall.
</P>
<P>
   Other problems also loom. There is a $6.5 billion gap between
what Congress has agreed to spend and the bottom line beyond which
the spending will dip into the Social Security surplus _ even with
the creative accounting that Republicans have used to disguise more
than $20 billion in the spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   Then both sides have to agree on whether the final accounting
for the spending by the Congressional Budget Office lets them argue
plausibly that the bills will not tap into the retirement funds.
</P>
<P>
   Other potential blockades remain as well. No deal has been
struck to allow the United States to pay the $926 million in back
dues it owes the United Nations. The White House wants a
quarter-billion dollars more for debt relief for the world's
poorest nations. Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., threatens to stop the
Senate cold next week in the name of protecting his state's 23,000
dairy farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Any one of these issues _ the riders, the U.N. dues, the debt
relief, the debate over the Social Security surplus _ could bring
the omnibus spending bill down to defeat, said the House minority
leader, Dick Gephardt of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very concerned that it can't pass,'' Gephardt said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Obey, the Democrat who has the most authority over the spending
bills in the House, said, ``You run the risk of it blowing up,
because of the critical mass of people opposed.''

EDITORIAL: DELICATE BARGAINING ON U.N. DUES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Nov. 13: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is right to try to negotiate a deal
with House Republicans that would allow payment of nearly $1
billion in back American dues to the United Nations. But it must
make clear that its willingness to compromise has limits. Even
though Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has offered to defend
any deal the administration makes from feminist criticism, Clinton
should not accept legislation that could be used to penalize family
planning organizations when they use their own money to advocate
more humane abortion laws. That is too consequential and lasting a
change in American policy to sign on to simply because Albright has
volunteered to serve as the administration's flak-catcher.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation to pay the arrears has passed the Senate in recent
years, with the support of Sen. Jesse Helms, long one of the U.N.'s
fiercest critics. But it has been held up in the House. Senior
House Republicans have let the U.N. money become entangled with an
unrelated and unacceptable amendment that would terminate aid to
international family planning groups that lobby to change harsh
foreign abortion laws.
</P>
<P>
   The two issues are clearly separate. But for the past three
years, Rep. Christopher Smith of New Jersey, backed by the House
leadership, has tried to bully the administration into accepting
punishment of abortion advocacy abroad as the price for the House's
approving payment of U.N. arrears.
</P>
<P>
   Until this year, the administration has maintained its
pro-choice principles, even at the cost of the U.N. money. But now
there may be room for a pragmatic compromise, based on language
that has already won support from a majority of House members and
is conditionally acceptable to pro-choice and family planning
groups.
</P>
<P>
   That formulation would deny American aid only to those groups
that violate the abortion or lobbying laws of their host country.
Unlike the Smith amendment, that formula would not put Washington
in the position of gagging the free speech of family planning
groups abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Smith rejects this compromise, and to placate him, Republican
leaders are demanding more damaging concessions. Negotiators from
both sides are considering a plan that would enact the Smith
amendment into law but give Clinton authority to waive its
application in specific cases. The cost of such a waiver, however,
would be corresponding reductions in spending on family planning
aid. That proposal, which has tempted some administration
officials, should be resisted.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has some leverage in this bargaining. It should
not be afraid to use it. The House Republican position is not a
popular one among Republicans in the Senate or the broader American
public. The administration has offered a reasonable compromise and
should not rush to go further.

 &HT;    The battle for legitimacy
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ For the combatants, tonight at the Thomas &AMP; Mack
Center means a chance to stand atop the boxing world as heavyweight
champion.
</P>
<P>
   For the sport, tonight means legitimacy. So, which one has the
most to lose? Evander Holyfield, Lennox Lewis or the fight game?
</P>
<P>
   In every circle, it's unanimous: Boxing wins if Holyfield and
Lewis put on a memorable display of pugilism. Memorable for solid,
exciting efforts, without punches after the bell, body slams or
suspect judging _ elements that have discredited a game that could
hardly use such transgressions.
</P>
<P>
   ``For better or for worse, this is now more important than just
a fight for the undisputed heavyweight title, and that is saying
something,'' said president of HBO Sports, Seth Abraham. ``That's
still one of the most important titles in sports, but because of
all the problems this year, this fight has taken on a larger
significance. It's not the Crusades. It's not the Christians vs.
the Muslims. But for the boxing industry, it's a very important
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Such significance is not lost on the participants. Both have
said they are going to do their part to make the unification bout a
thriller. ``My performance,'' Holyfield said, ``will be one that
may make everyone forget about all that has happened this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis (34-1-1) said, ``I think we'll go at it a little more.
I'll be right in front of him. He won't have to look for me. . . .
And I think everyone wants to see us mix it up.''
</P>
<P>
   There was little mixing it up in the first fight, March 13 in
New York. The bout was ruled a controversial draw, starting the
series of incidents that have threatened the viability of the
sport. Lewis was in control much of the fight, using his effective
left jab to keep Holyfield at a distance from which he could
inflict no damage.
</P>
<P>
   However, on the occasions when Lewis seemed to have a chance to
pound Holyfield (36-3-1), he did not. ``Lennox Lewis had a perfect
opportunity to be the undisputed heavyweight champion,'' Holyfield,
37, said of their first encounter. ``He didn't take the chance
because he said I might catch him with a shot. Some people don't
have the fortitude. Sometimes you have to take chances in life.
Winners in life take chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis promised that it would be the only change in his strategy
this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some say it's better to be cautious than sorry,'' he said.
``Some say I'm too cautious. I'm the one in there. Maybe I was a
bit too cautious in the first fight. I won't be in this one. ''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' size (6-foot-5, 242 pounds) and strength gave Holyfield
(6-2, 217) much trouble in March. But it might have been Lewis'
reluctance to brawl that hampered Holyfield the most.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a fighter presses me and comes straight ahead, it's a lot
easier for me,'' Holyfield said. ``When it's a defensive fighter, I
get lured into a lazy posture.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest corrections Holyfield said he will make will be in
lateral movement against Lewis' jab and head movement. Also, he
will concentrate on getting inside, where he's close enough to do
damage. ``It's not 'if' I can get inside, because I can,''
Holyfield said. ``It's what I do when I'm there. I prefer to be
inside, but I have to fight well on the outside, too.''
</P>
<P>
   His trainer, Don Turner, wants Holyfield to attack Lewis early
and see whether he has the heart to fight back. ``I'd like to see
that,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   But Holyfield has to be healthy to do so. He complained of
cramps and general lethargy in their first encounter, which he said
stunted his mobility. He since has been on a diet low in fats and
carbohydrates and high in protein and natural fibers. His attorney,
Jim Thomas, said Holyfield is in peak physical condition.
</P>
<P>
   And Turner said his fighter is more determined than ever. ``He's
better than ever,'' Turner said. ``I've been with him 5 1/2 years
and I've never seen him this good. And I've never seen Evander so
vicious and intense. He sent sparring partners out of camp almost
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, according to his trainer, Emanuel Steward, is just as
determined. ``There is not a heavyweight in the world who can go
past six rounds with Lennox right now,'' he said. ``He trained much
better, much harder this time. He wants a knockout. . . . Never has
anybody played and toyed with Evander the way Lennox did in the
first fight. When a big man fights a small man, he'll win easy.''
</P>
<P>
   If the fight matches the talk, many in the sport will be happy _
and relieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boxing has had some very bad setbacks this year,'' Abraham
said. ``They've affected the fans' faith in the sport. That's why
in all our advertising we're not calling this a rematch or
Holyfield-Lewis II. I've spoken to all sides about that. We're not
selling this as a rematch. We don't want to remind people of March
13.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're selling it as the undisputed heavyweight championship of
the world, the biggest night in sports. If it's Holyfield-Lewis I,
the silence will be deafening. It's probably unfair, but these two
men are carrying more than their title belts into the ring.''

   Henriette Diabate and 15 other leaders of the main opposition
party, Rally of the Republicans, were sentenced to up to two years
in prison by a government-controlled court for having led a protest
in Abidjan. The government of President Henri Konan Bedie said the
party's presidential candidate in next year's election, Alassane
Ouattara, is not Ivoirian and is ineligible to run, which prompted
the protest.

   New Zealand Foreign Minister Don McKinnon was elected the
Commonwealth's new secretary general during the organization's
summit meeting in Durban. McKinnon, 60, who defeated former

   CONGO: REBEL TELLS OF FIGHTING
</P>
<P>
   A rebel leader accused President Laurent Kabila of launching a
``general offensive,'' in what he said was another violation of the
three-month-old cease-fire. The truce, part of a comprehensive
peace pact, appeared ever more shaky as the rebel, Jean-Pierre
Bemba, pledged to ``repulse the enemy'' from several towns. U.N.
officials in the region could not confirm the fighting.

<P>
   SWAZILAND: SUSPICIOUS BLAST
</P>
<P>
   A suspicious explosion destroyed a government building outside
Mbabane, the capital. No one was injured in the blast, which comes
almost a year after bombs destroyed a bridge near a military base
and killed a guard at a government office in the capital. Swaziland
is one of the world's last absolute monarchies, and pressure to
open up the political system has grown in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   BURUNDI: U.N. ALARMED
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed by outbreaks of violence and the flight of refugees in
Burundi, the United Nations Security Council met to urge Burundi's
neighbors to move quickly and pick a successor to Tanzanian
President Julius Nyerere, who died Oct. 14 while trying to mediate
a peace between Burundi's warring factions. The United States also
called the Burundian government's regrouping of 340,000 people in
camps near the capital ``a major human rights violation.''

   The far-right leader Joerg Haider apologized for past remarks
about the Nazi period, saying he believed he had hurt people's
feelings. Haider also said he understood that Jews felt anxious
about his success in October's election, but said they had nothing
to fear from his Freedom Party. At a rally in Vienna scheduled
earlier, some 20,000 people protested racism and Haider's policies
on curbing immigration.

   The Jewish Claims Conference delegation negotiating with Germany
over a Holocaust restitution fund for former Nazi slaves said the

in Bonn. Though there are signs of progress, no breakthrough is
expected.

   NASDAQ SETS ITS 10TH HIGH IN LAST 11 TRADING SESSIONS
</P>
<P>
   Led by banks and financial companies, the stock market rose
after a government report on productivity eased investors' worries
that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates for a third time
this year when policy-makers meet on Tuesday. The NASDAQ composite
index closed at its 10th record high in the last 11 sessions,
rising 23.86 points, or 0.75 of a percent, to 3,221.15.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rallied 174.02 points, or 1.64
percent, to 10,769.32. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index gained
14.60 points, or 1.06 percent, to 1,396.06.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond decreased to 6.03 percent
from 6.09 percent on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   TRADE NEGOTIATORS EXTEND TALKS
</P>
<P>
   U.S. trade officials said they would extend their stay in
Beijing to a fourth day for at least one more meeting in a
last-ditch effort to salvage an agreement on China's entry into the
World Trade Organization. The Americans announced on Friday that
they were heading home after three days of fruitless talks. But
after an exchange of messages during the night, the two sides
agreed to meet again Saturday morning to make another try.
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTIE'S TO GO IT ALONE ON INTERNET
</P>
<P>
   Christie's decided against joining forces with an online
retailer like eBay or Walt Disney's Go.com to offer online
auctions. Five months after its archrival Sotheby's allied itself
with Amazon.com, Christie's said it had concluded that a link with
an online retailer risked diluting the Christie's brand name.
</P>
<P>
   `HISTORIC' BANKING MEASURE SIGNED
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton signed into law a sweeping financial
modernization bill that will allow banks, insurance companies and
brokerage firms to buy into each other's businesses without
restrictions. ``This legislation is truly historic,'' Clinton said
of the measure, which repeals parts of the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act
and the 1956 Bank Holding Company Act.
</P>
<P>
   TRADE BODY STALLS ON AGENDA
</P>
<P>
   Member countries of the World Trade Organization are mired in
gridlock over the agenda for negotiations. Trade ministers, who are
scheduled to gather in Seattle in two weeks, could be facing a huge
wish list from member countries that will be difficult to tackle in
the four-day meeting, which is designed to kick off new
market-opening negotiations. The trade body's director-general,
Mike Moore, has warned publicly that the impasse threatens to
torpedo the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ENVIRONMENT ISSUES IN BUDGET FIGHT
</P>
<P>
   The most explosive issues remaining in the budget battle are
legislative land mines pitting business interests against
environmentalists. Even as the White House and Congress try to
strike a final deal, new pro-business, anti-environmental measures
are suddenly appearing, including one that seeks to block the
government from collecting millions of dollars in fines from power
companies that it says are defying clean-air laws.
</P>
<P>
   BURNHAM PACIFIC EXPLORING OPTIONS
</P>
<P>
   Four months after rejecting a $1.2 billion buyout offer, Burnham
Pacific Properties said it was exploring ``a full range of
strategic alternatives.'' The San Diego-based real estate
investment trust, which is one of the largest developers of strip
shopping centers on the West Coast, owns about 80 properties, with
13 million square feet of space.
</P>
<P>
   4 BID FOR FAILED JAPANESE BANK
</P>
<P>
   Four major Japanese companies _ Ito-Yokado, Softbank, Orix and
Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance _ are jointly bidding for the
failed Nippon Credit Bank. But spokesmen declined to provide
details of the bid structure and declined to say if the group will
make a separate bid for the trust bank unit, Nippon Credit Trust
Bank, if the planned purchase of the parent fails.

 &HT;    Day's best: 'Bama vs. Miss. State
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUSCALOOSA, Ala. _ November is the best month in college
football because, for most teams, what happens in these 30 days
defines the season. A team that looked invincible in September and
October can become mortal in November. Ask Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   The November games are the ones you have to live with the entire
offseason, good or bad. Today's game between Alabama and
Mississippi State is such a game.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama (7-2) has had more than its share of problems this
season, on and off the field. But a win over No. 8 Mississippi
State (8-0) puts the Crimson Tide a giant step closer to the SEC
Championship Game in Atlanta on Dec. 4. Alabama needs the win for a
lot of different reasons. Coach Mike DuBose really needs it, too.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi State would like to return to the SEC Championship
Game, where they gave national champ Tennessee all it wanted a year
ago. The Mississippi State campus is just 90 minutes away, and
their fans have snatched up every ticket they could find. And by
the way, the Bulldogs think they can get into the national
championship race.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Alabama puts down that Mississippi State is going to be
one of its biggest games of the season, then you know you've come a
long way with your program,'' said Jackie Sherrill, whose team has
beaten Alabama three games in a row.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a college football player, coach, or fan, these are
the kind of games you live for.
</P>
<P>
   SEC
</P>
<P>
   Auburn (4-5) at Georgia (6-2), 6 p.m., ESPN2. Georgia has more
athletes but must exploit that advantage by putting maximum
pressure on Auburn quarterback Ben Leard and forcing some
turnovers. The Bulldogs need to get the lead early and not let the
Tigers hang around until the fourth quarter. Georgia, 24-17.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi State (8-0) at Alabama (7-2), 3:30 p.m., CBS.
Mississippi State is probably the most-maligned 8-0 team in SEC
history. Alabama will have its two big guns, quarterback Andrew Zow
and running back Shaun Alexander, who will tackle the nation's No.
1 defense. Bama gets the slight edge at home. Alabama, 14-13.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee (7-1) at Arkansas (5-3), 12:30 p.m., NBC. The Arkansas
players have had this date circled on their calendar since losing a
heartbreaker to the Vols in Knoxville last season. The Hogs are
tough at home, but Tennessee might be the best team in the country
right now. Tennessee, 31-10.
</P>
<P>
   Florida (8-1) at South Carolina, 12:30 p.m. Coach Steve Spurrier
is not worried about winning this one. He's worried about getting
his offense ready for next week's visit by No. 1 Florida State.
Florida, 31-3.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky (5-4) at Vanderbilt (5-4), 9 p.m., ESPN 2. A huge game
for two teams that are trying to qualify for bowls. Both teams have
to play Tennessee in their final game, so this game is their best
chance to make the postseason. Kentucky, 24-20.
</P>
<P>
   Houston (5-4) at LSU (2-7), 8 p.m. After three one-point losses,
Tiger coach Gerry DiNardo is looking for anything positive. The
atmosphere in Baton Rouge will not be festive, but the Tigers have
enough talent to get the job done. LSU, 24-14.
</P>
<P>
   ACC
</P>
<P>
   Clemson (5-4) at Georgia Tech (6-2), noon, Fox Sports Net South.
Clemson coach Tommy Bowden knows how to find the weakness in a
defense and exploit it. That should be a serious concern to a
Georgia Tech team that gave up 42 points in a loss to Virginia.
Tech finds a way, but it won't be easy. Georgia Tech, 31-27.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland (5-4) at Florida State (9-0), 3:30 p.m. Florida State
will be doing a lot of experimenting today, getting ready for next
week's trip to Florida. Freshman QB Latrez Harrison of Atlanta gets
his first college start against one of the best defenses in the
country. Ouch. Florida State, 42-7.
</P>
<P>
   Wake Forest (5-4) at Duke (2-7), 1:30 p.m. Wake Forest has a
chance to become eligible for a bowl for the first time since 1992,
Bill Dooley's last year as coach. Wake Forest, 24-14.
</P>
<P>
   Top 25
</P>
<P>
   No. 19 Miami (5-3) at No. 2 Virginia Tech (8-0), 7:30 p.m.,
ESPN. Virginia Tech was fortunate last week to get a wakeup call
but still pulled out a 22-20 win over West Virginia. Miami is one
of the few teams on the Hokies schedule athletic enough to run with
them. Virginia Tech, 24-20.
</P>
<P>
   No. 16 Michigan (7-2) at No. 6 Penn State (9-1), noon, ABC. Penn
State saw the national championship slip through its fingers in
last week's loss to Minnesota. Can the Nittany Lions get back up
for a hard-to-figure Michigan team? Yes. Penn State, 17-14.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa (1-8) at No. 9 Wisconsin (8-2), 3:30 p.m. The Badgers need
a win to position themselves for a BCS bowl, and running back Ron
Dayne needs 99 yards to become the NCAA's all-time leading rusher.
Wisconsin 42, Iowa 3.
</P>
<P>
   The rest: Texas 24, Texas Tech 20; W. Michigan 21, Marshall 20;
BYU 31, Wyoming 21; Minnesota 28, Indiana 24; Washington 24, UCLA
17.

EDITORIAL: KINGPINS AND THE CONSTITUTION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Nov. 13: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The target of a new anti-drug initiative now speeding toward
final congressional approval is a worthy one _ big international
drug traffickers. But as too often happens when Congress
collaborates with the Clinton administration to toughen law
enforcement policies, civil liberties stand to suffer.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, called the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation
Act, overwhelmingly passed the House just two weeks ago. A
House-Senate conference committee incorporated the measure in the
annual intelligence authorization bill that needs only a final
floor vote in the Senate before going to the president's desk for
his signature. All of this occurred without any public hearings or
extended debate to explore the legislation's implications for due
process and other constitutional values.
</P>
<P>
   Under the measure, the government will be required to compile an
annual list of those it determines to be ``significant foreign
narcotics traffickers'' under standards the bill does not
articulate. The government would then have authority to freeze
their assets in the United States without any chance for judicial
review of the basis of the designation. Americans who engage in
financial dealings with a person or company on the list could have
their assets blocked, again without the benefit of full judicial
review. The measure makes no exception for those investors or
partners who thought they were dealing with legitimate businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this the America we want?'' asked Rep. Jerrold Nadler,
D.N.Y., as he waged a lonely and futile fight against the bill in
the House. ``What is the remedy if the bureaucracy gets the wrong
person?''
</P>
<P>
   Those pertinent questions were sadly lost in the rush to crack
down on foreign drug lords before Congress adjourns.

GIULIANI SCOLDS MRS. CLINTON FOR WEST BANK EMBRACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (With MRSCLINTON-POLITICS, MRSCLINTON-MIDEAST) 
(lh) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani sharply criticized Hillary
Rodham Clinton Friday for ``embracing and kissing'' Suha Arafat,
the wife of the Palestinian Authority president, after listening to
Mrs. Arafat excoriate Israel for using what she said were
carcinogenic crowd-control gases in Gaza and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly wouldn't have embraced the person who said it,
hugged them and kissed them,'' the mayor said at a hastily called
City Hall news conference. ``I wouldn't embrace a person who said
that afterward, because I would understand that by embracing
someone, you approve.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton appeared uncomfortable during Mrs. Arafat's remarks
on Thursday in Ramallah on the West Bank. While Mrs. Clinton and
Mrs. Arafat kissed and warmly embraced before Mrs. Arafat's
remarks, afterward they exchanged a hastier kiss. ``They didn't hug
goodbye,'' said Marsha Berry, Mrs. Clinton's press secretary.
``There wasn't any big departure farewell.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the body language, Giuliani drew a sharp contrast
between himself and the first lady, whom he is expected to run
against for the U.S. Senate next year. ``Had I been in a situation
like that, I would have objected to it,'' Giuliani said. When asked
how he would have objected _ by leaving the dais, for example _
Giuliani responded: ``Well, look, you know, it's all hypothetical.
I mean, I can't imagine myself in that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, the press secretary for Mrs. Clinton's Senate
exploratory committee, responded: ``Hillary Clinton isn't going to
put New York Senate politics in front of the Middle East peace
process. We will leave that to the mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson added that Mrs. Clinton was ``outraged and infuriated''
by Mrs. Arafat's comment, but went to Ramallah as first lady, to
announce that the United States would finance a health care program
there, because ``she believed it would help'' the peace process.
``Now some people are saying she should have walked out of the
room,'' Wolfson said. ``But that would have damaged the peace
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has long criticized Mrs. Clinton for her statement last
year that a Palestinian state is ``very important'' to Middle East
peace. Although polls show that Mrs. Clinton's views are shared by
increasing numbers of Jews in America and Israel, her position is
generally not supported by the conservative Jewish voters who are a
base of Giuliani's support.
</P>
<P>
   Friday during his weekly radio call-in show, in some of his most
extensive remarks to date on the Middle East peace process,
Giuliani criticized both the Palestinians and the Clinton
administration. ``A lot more pressure should be put on the
Palestinian Authority than the Clinton administration has been
willing to do,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there also has to be a recognition that there really is
not a moral equivalent between the state of Israel and the
Palestinian Authority. The state of Israel is a democratically
elected government of laws very, very similar to the United States.
The Palestinian Authority has not arrived at that yet. And
therefore you've got to demand something of them. You've got to be
strong enough to demand something of them. And not constantly be
demanding maybe what's easier _ more of Israel. So I think some
equity here would be valuable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian Authority was set up under the Oslo agreements
of 1993 to govern Palestinian self-rule areas in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip until a permanent settlement is negotiated. The
president of the authority, Yasser Arafat, was elected in 1996. An
88-member legislative body, the Palestinian Legislative Council,
was also elected then.

U.N. AIRPLANE CRASHES IN KOSOVO

   PRISTINA, Kosovo _ A U.N. airplane with 24 people on board
crashed Friday in northern Kosovo during a flight headed here from
Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Wreckage of the plane was found on a steep mountainside about 12
miles northeast of Kosovska Mitrovica, late Friday night, about 12
hours after the plane went missing.
</P>
<P>
   A helicopter pilot who spotted the plane said that its front was
virtually disintegrated and that there were no immediate signs of
survivors, a spokesman for the NATO-led peacekeeping forces told
Agence France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was a daily charter flight by the World Food Program,
a U.N. agency, and normally carries U.N. officials, aid workers and
sometimes journalists from Rome to the newly reopened Slatina
airport here. On Friday, the flight carried 21 passengers and three
crewmembers, but officials would not release the names or
nationalities of the people on board.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said there was no sign that the twin-engine, turbo
propeller aircraft, a French-Italian ATR-42, had been attacked. It
disappeared from radar at about noon near Vucitrn, some 12 miles
northwest of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from the manufacturer said that the plane, 13 years
old, had 25,000 hours of flying time in July, when it was delivered
to an Italian charter company, Si Fly.
</P>
<P>
   The World Food Program currently provides food aid to about
900,000 people a day in Kosovo _ more than half the current
population of the province. During the war in Kosovo from March
through June, some 800,000 ethnic Albanians were driven or fled
from Kosovo, and many of them returned to destroyed houses and
contaminated wells.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands more were forced from their homes inside Kosovo but
never left the province, living as best they could in the
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is feeding about 1.5 million people throughout the
Balkans, as well as some 500,000 people in Yugoslavia who were
affected by the war.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the agency fed some 75 million people, including most
of the world's refugees. It operates in 80 countries. According to
the agency, it has lost more employees than any other U.N. agency _
51 since 1988 _ in work-related accidents, illnesses or attacks.

SHIFTING PRIORITIES, GORE CONTINUES DISTANCING HIMSELF FROM
CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After nearly eight years of touting himself as the
most influential vice president in history, Al Gore has apparently
had enough: He now thinks that his elected position as
second-in-command is secondary to his run for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Running for president of this country is far more important
than being the best vice president I can possibly be,'' Gore told
reporters Thursday in response to a question about what accounted
for the dramatic overhaul of his campaign in the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of thinking like a vice president, which means, `How
am I going to advance the administration's goals and help the
current administration?', I started thinking like someone who was
asking the people for their ideas on how to make this a better
country and then responding spontaneously from the heart,'' Gore
said. ``And once that happened, then I said, `Hey, I gotta move my
campaign out of Washington.'''
</P>
<P>
   The comments seemed striking, given that Gore has always cast
his role as far more vital than mere standby equipment, and
reflects how difficult the job can be, trying to be his own man
while representing the Clinton administration. He is also attached
to the only modern president who has ever been impeached (in fact,
he is the only vice president ever to serve under an impeached
president). And so Gore seemed in his comments to go beyond
distancing himself to nearly severing himself, not just from Bill
Clinton but from his own job.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the job carries certain benefits, and Gore has not shied
from them. Just this week, during a three-day campaign swing, he
made two ``official'' appearances, including a Veterans Day speech
in Iowa, that gave him a platform to extol his views of America's
role in the world and allowed him to charge taxpayers for the trip.
Although the speech was deemed government business, Gore used the
occasion to chastise Republicans as isolationists. And the speech
took place at one of the sites where Iowans will caucus in little
more than two months to cast their votes for president.
</P>
<P>
   But even on overtly political occasions, he cannot always escape
the fact that he represents the administration. On Monday, he plans
to visit the Seattle headquarters of Microsoft, as a candidate who
is courting Washington state's largest employer, just as his rivals
have done.
</P>
<P>
   But at a time when the Justice Department is pursuing a
antitrust suit against the computer giant, Gore, who is the
administration's point man on technology, is likely to be seen as
an emissary whose visit might assuage some of the bitterness
between the government and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   (The visit was temporarily in doubt Friday night when Gore
learned belatedly that Microsoft intended to close the event to
reporters, as it had closed previous sessions with presidential
candidates. Both sides said they were negotiating the ground rules
and anticipated that Gore would still come.)
</P>
<P>
   Critics are pouncing on Gore's tough balancing act, which they
say is his attempt to have it both ways.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Pascoe, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee,
said: ``To say that I'm giving up my job but I'm certainly going to
take the benefits of the job to campaign _ it's nice having Air
Force II, taxpayer-funded advance people to help me against this
insurgent who has to spend twice as much as I do just to stay even
_ it's hypocrisy pure and simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just an elected official who is using the powers
of incumbency to aid his campaign,'' Pascoe added ``but he has now
said publicly he is not going to be vice president anymore. That's
what's outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what is different about two Republican officeholders,
Texas Gov. George W. Bush of and Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who
are seeking to become president. ``They are still doing their
jobs,'' Pascoe said.
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, being vice president and running for president is no
longer a conflict; he says he has reset his priorities so that his
campaign for president comes first.
</P>
<P>
   He insists he is not shirking his duties, the primary one being
to serve as president pro tem of the Senate and break tie votes.
But his campaign schedule no longer allows for his weekly luncheons
with President Clinton or for him to be on hand every time a
foreign leader visits Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Officials who know both men say that the vice president believes
Clinton does not need Gore's tutelage on the ways of Washington as
much as he did early in the administration.
</P>
<P>
   But they also say the relationship between Clinton and Gore has
become much colder as the vice president seeks to assert his
independence. Clinton has yet to make a public campaign appearance
with Gore, but aides say he intends to do so and that the president
has raised money for him, most notably in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   As he searches for his footing, Gore has been undergoing a
painfully public coming-out process, with regular reports now about
everything from what is ``in his heart'' to his wardrobe to the
inner workings of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Campaigns are intended to be transformational,'' Gore said,
saying that the process of connecting to an audience and listening
to people's concerns led him to overhaul his style, his message and
his operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started connecting in a new way, I started going
through some changes,'' he said. ``Six months ago if I told you I
was enjoying it, I'm not sure that I really was that much,'' he
said. ``When I tell you I'm enjoying it now, you believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that earlier, when he was asked a question, he would
think about whether he was advancing the administration's goals.
``The shift in priorities that I'm talking about in personal terms
has to do with eliminating that step,'' he said. ``And instead,
when you ask me a question, without hesitation, I tell you exactly
what's in my heart on it, spontaneously, here's what I feel about
it. And if that conflicts with what the administration's priorities
are _ I don't want it to, but if it does _ so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Gore has distanced himself very little on substantive
policy issues from the Clinton administration. But the political
bind he is in because of his position was evident when he was
talking about Microsoft. He was asked what kind of signal his visit
would send. ``None,'' he declared. ``I strongly support vigorous
enforcement of the antitrust law.'' But he added that Microsoft was
the largest employer in Washington and that his rivals had all
visited its campus outside Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I don't comment on individual cases,'' he added, ``I
want you to know that I think the trend toward concentration in
some areas _ and I have agriculture especially in mind _ has been
very troubling.''
</P>
<P>
   He also wears his administration hat when he is asked about his
``official'' Veterans Day speech in Iowa. Even though he lambasted
the Republicans for what he said were isolationist views and for
not paying America's dues to the United Nations, as well as for
cutting the foreign policy budget and failing to pass the nuclear
test-ban treaty, he insisted his was an official visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a speech on Veterans Day to veterans at a VA facility
ought to be official,'' he said, ``and in the process to talk about
how we can honor our veterans by helping to make future wars less
likely is not only appropriate but necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   He made another appearance this week that was cast as official,
this one in Memphis, Tenn., on Tuesday night to address the 92nd
annual convention of the Church of God in Christ. The setting was
the church where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his
``Mountaintop'' speech just before his assassination. The audience
was extremely friendly to Gore, who spoke in a sermonlike manner
for nearly an hour about his views on family, health care,
education and included a few potshots at Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   His aides said this was an official visit because the invitation
was extended to him as vice president, not as a candidate. But the
audience had little doubt. ``I think this was very political,''
said Lee Shirley, 59, a worshiper from Los Angeles who found Gore
an ``excellent'' speaker. ``No. 1, he's interested in running for
office,'' she said, ``and naturally he wants to win as many votes
from our community as he can.''

</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Wednesday, Nov.
10, about the number of bodies found by war crimes investigators in
Kosovo referred incorrectly to a State Department briefing on April
19. The department did not say that up to 500,000 Kosovar Albanians
were missing and feared dead. Its spokesman, James P. Rubin, said
that 100,000 men were unaccounted for and that ``based on past
practice, it is chilling to think where those 100,000 men are.'' He
said, ``We know that civilian casualties are the objective of
President Milosevic's policy.''

   LAS VEGAS _ On the eve of a big fight, perhaps the last
significant heavyweight fight of the millennium, Emanuel Steward,
the trainer who put Thomas ``Hit Man'' Hearns on the map, is in a
clinch, simultaneously excited and frustrated. With a victory over
Evander Holyfield on Saturday night, his client, Lennox Lewis, the
World Boxing Council champion, will become the undisputed
heavyweight champion of the world.
</P>
<P>
   A riveting fight will be the first real step to re-establishing
professional boxing's popularity, more so than federal regulations
or moral hand-wringing over the fairness of the sport. Steward, who
has trained 11 champions, feels that Lewis, imposing at 6 feet 5
inches, 242 pounds, could be the most dominating fighter in boxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Lennox opened up, he would knock Evander out in the first
round,'' Steward said. ``But I don't believe he's going to do it.
It's like he's got somebody with a chain holding him back, or like
a racehorse that's got a weight on its back. Lennox has put that
weight on himself, and I don't know if he's going to take it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Steward feels the weight on his fighter's back is a 64-square
menagerie of kings and queens, bishops, knights and pawns. Lewis is
an avid chess player, and throughout the week Steward has contended
that the boxer's fondness for the game has become an impediment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm against chess because in the ring he can't forget it,''
Steward said. ``This thinking and analyzing and looking two steps
ahead to how he could take advantage of Holyfield's mistakes
worries me.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night's fight is a rematch of a battle last March at
New York's Madison Square Garden. Lewis controlled the fight but
didn't finish strongly, and the match ended in a draw. Saturday
night, Lewis is expected to come out more aggressively, take
chances and take charge. At least this is what Steward wants. Lewis
himself prefers finesse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am into the sweet science of the sport,'' he said. ``I'm
going in there to use all my talent: my height, my reach and my
boxing ability. It's not all about going in there and knocking
people out. So I think it really comes down to me: what I believe
and how I should go about it. I think this time I'll be as cautious
and take more chances as well.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the legitimate talk about having boxing's redemption
tied up in one fight, for Steward, Saturday night's bout is in
large measure about himself and Holyfield. Steward worked for
Holyfield six years ago, after Holyfield's loss to Riddick Bowe and
subsequent temporary retirement. When Holyfield returned to boxing,
he hired Steward, who then helped Holyfield in his rematch victory
over Bowe in 1993. After the victory, Steward asked for a raise.
Holyfield said no, and Steward said goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I did for him was a total resurrection job,'' Steward
said at the time. ``All I asked for was what I thought I deserved.
I was used.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield then responded: ``It's all about ego with some
trainers. The trainer's only as good as the fighter. The trainer
don't make the fighter. It's all about money with Emanuel. He looks
at this as a lawyer does a client. Lawyers will try to get any
client in the world, just to keep their paydays flowing.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield bristles at suggestions that Steward helped him get
the title. ``Get the title?'' he said. ``Ain't nobody got me
nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Steward, Holyfield said: ``This man told me what to
do, and I paid him the money to tell me what to do. If that's all
it took, go find another fighter and make him champion.''
</P>
<P>
   That brings us to Steward and Lennox Lewis _ a fiery trainer and
a different sort of fighter who ``plays'' boxing the way athletes
play football or basketball or hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a boxer/puncher,'' he said this week. ``I'm not like Mike
Tyson.'' When someone asked about Holyfield's legacy of being a
warrior, Lewis said: ``I don't know if I want to be a warrior.
Warriors have to take punishment and come back. I think there's a
point where you can't come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Steward is predicting that he, his sport and his fighter will
storm back to prominence Saturday night with a crushing checkmate.
``The fight will end in a knockout,'' he said. ``I wanted a
knockout the first time, but Lennox wanted to show all his talents,
his boxing skills. This time, Lennox is more focused on a knockout.
And for his legacy, he needs it.''
</P>
<P>
   Evander Holyfield was boxing's Real Deal, Lennox Lewis could be
a sorely needed Paul Bunyan. &QL;

 PARENTS SUE OVER DEATH OF CHILD WHO CHOKED ON POKEMON TOY 
</HEADLINE>

 By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The parents of a Yonkers, N.Y., boy who choked to
death on a Pokemon ball filed a federal lawsuit against the toy's
maker and distributor on Friday, two days after the opening of a
movie about the popular game.
</P>
<P>
   The parents, Adrienne and Kevin Brazier, claim that the toy
manufacturer, Hasbro Inc., and the distributor, Toys ``R'' Us, were
negligent in making and selling the toy _ a 1.7-inch clear rubber
ball with a cartoon figure inside _ as safe for children over 3
years old.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 30, their autistic son, Robert, 7, was biting the ball
to remove the cartoon figure when he swallowed it, the Braziers
said Friday. Family members, neighbors, paramedics and emergency
room doctors were unable to dislodge the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit says the toy, a Pokemon Power Bouncer, violates
federal safety standards and presents a choking hazard because it
is smaller than 1.75 inches. ``If the ball was a little bit bigger,
it would never have gotten lodged,'' Mrs. Brazier said.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also said that the toy failed to pass a ``ring test''
established by a product safety company, ACTS Testing Labs Ltd.,
which measures the size of objects to determine choking hazards,
said Gary Certain, a lawyer for the family. The lawsuit seeks $100
million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro, the nation's second-largest toy maker, released a
statement Friday saying that it remained confident about the ball's
design and manufacture. ``Approximately 8 million of these balls
have been played with by children throughout the world without a
similar incident,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   A Toys ``R'' Us spokeswoman, Rebecca Caruso, said that she could
not comment because she had not seen the suit, but that all of the
company's toys meet federal safety standards. She added, ``We think
it was a very tragic incident and our deepest sympathies go out to
the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Brazier said she and her husband decided to sue when the
companies failed to redesign the ball or remove it from stores.
``It was the only way to get through to them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was timed to reach as many families as possible, she
said, with the movie opening and Christmas around the corner. ``We
could never live with ourselves if we saw that another child died
tragically the way ours did,'' Mrs. Brazier said.

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Nov. 13:
</P>
<P>
   For all its progress since those ugly days when only whites
could vote, Mississippi now faces an embarrassing reminder of its
worst old instincts. That embarrassment comes in the form of the
gubernatorial race that is still officially undecided 11 days after
the election. The Democratic candidate, Lt. Gov. Ronnie Musgrove,
received the most votes, 6,600 more than the Republican candidate,
former U.S. Rep. Mike Parker. If that would seem to settle matters
elsewhere in the union, it does not in Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi's constitution includes a passage written more than
a century ago that was designed specifically to keep blacks from
gaining political power in the state. This provision requires that
if a candidate does not win a majority of the popular vote and a
majority of the 122 Mississippi House districts, the House members
choose the winner. Musgrove fell just short of a majority, with
49.5 percent of the vote, and Parker, who got 48.6 percent, is
stubbornly refusing to concede. Musgrove's Democratic colleagues
control the House, so his eventual victory seems assured. But that
vote will not come until Jan. 4. In practical terms, that means
Parker has invented a nearly two-month interregnum for reminding
the nation of his state's racist past.
</P>
<P>
   Parker may be holding out for reasons of shock. Pre-election
polls showed an easy Republican victory. But the continued efforts
to wheedle extra votes out of the legislature in hopes of
overruling the electorate can only make the Republicans look petty
and undemocratic.
</P>
<P>
   The delay in declaring a new governor should encourage
Mississippians to get rid of one of the last reminders of their
state's segregationist heritage. The Mississippi constitution no
longer requires literacy tests or poll taxes to keep blacks from
voting. It should also be rid of the 1890 provision designed to
give white legislators a chance to prevent any blacks who won at
the polls from ever taking office. &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Nov. 13:
</P>
<P>
   Fifty years ago, Aldo Leopold's ecological testament, ``A Sand
County Almanac,'' was published. It was a posthumous book,
appearing a year and a half after Leopold died of a heart attack in
April 1948 at the age of 61. A graduate of the Yale Forestry School
and a 17-year veteran of the U.S. Forest Service, Leopold had his
greatest influence, during his lifetime, as a professor of game
management at the University of Wisconsin. But it is the
``Almanac,'' his meditations on a Wisconsin River farm and an
unequivocal statement of conscience, that will carry his influence
and his good name down the generations.
</P>
<P>
   Leopold's principal and extraordinary contribution to our world
was to articulate the idea of a land ethic. The human relation to
land, he wrote, ``is still strictly economic, entailing privileges
but not obligations.'' Leopold believed that the basis of
successful conservation was to extend to nature the ethical sense
of responsibility that humans extend to each other. This idea has
acquired tremendous force since ``A Sand County Almanac'' first
appeared. The fact that the idea now seems unexceptionable is a
measure of its widespread influence.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty years is both a very short and a very long time in the
life of a good idea. The power of Leopold's argument _ buttressed
as it is by his clear, vigorous prose _ has not been blunted in the
least. In fact, his argument seems more urgently true now than
ever. In the past 50 years, Leopold's work has helped drive the
environmental movement. Yet the tendencies he lamented, summed up
in the phrase ``despoliation of land,'' have accelerated almost out
of control.
</P>
<P>
   Leopold will last not because he captured a moment or a feeling,
though he does both in the first sections of ``A Sand County
Almanac.'' He will last because we have scarcely begun to work out
the implications of his ideas. He suggested an ``ecological
interpretation of history,'' which has only recently begun to be
written. He recognized that the ``ability to see the cultural value
of wilderness boils down ... to a question of intellectual
humility.'' He described a dynamic that still threatens wildness:
``the very scarcity of wild places, reacting with the  &UR; mores &LR;  of
advertising and promotion, tends to defeat any deliberate effort to
prevent their growing still more scarce.''
</P>
<P>
   These are formidable ideas. But none are more challenging than
Leopold's land ethic. It requires a re-rooting in nature, a
forsaking of the hope that we can save wild or even open land on
the basis of its economic value. We are busy, Leopold says,
``inventing subterfuges to give (nature) economic importance.''
They will not work. There is a risk involved in creating a truly
ethical relation to the land. But Leopold believed in risk. ``Too
much safety,'' he wrote, ``seems to yield only danger in the long
run.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Hawks reveal bench role was Rider's choice
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND _ Looking forward to ``a game I had circled on my
calendar,'' Isaiah Rider will be in the lineup tonight when the
Hawks play Portland and former teammate Steve Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Rider and coach Lenny Wilkens agreed on that Friday after
acknowledging it was Rider's decision not to start Wednesday
against Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think having J.R. in the lineup with Chris Crawford and the
other three (Dikembe Mutombo, Alan Henderson and Bimbo Coles) is
the way to go right now,'' Wilkens said, ``because they both add so
much to the offense.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had also come to that conclusion before Wednesday
night's game, ``Although I was going another way during
shoot-around. I told J.R. before the game that I thought we'd be
better with him starting, but he thought we'd be better the way we
had practiced.''
</P>
<P>
   Rider said, ``It was no big deal to me then. My feeling was guys
went through shoot-around and went for their naps thinking it was
going to be one way, then it would be a disappointment to change. I
didn't want them to think that Lenny had me in the lineup just to
keep me happy because I already knew we were working up to having
me start by (Saturday's game). I already knew that.''
</P>
<P>
   This makes Rider's performance against the Grizzlies (2-for-7,
14 minutes) almost inexplicable. Wilkens removed him after a
five-minute stint in the second half because he showed obvious
disinterest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised,'' Wilkens said. ``I thought his head wasn't
there and I was surprised because we had talked before the game.
But we've had two talks since then and I'm going to put it behind
me and see where we go from here. I think he had to learn about me.
But I don't want to see it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Rider scored 65 points in three previous games, one a start in
Denver. It was his 28-point show in that game, Wilkens said, that
convinced him Rider should join the lineup for keeps ahead of
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready now,'' Rider said after a lengthy practice.
``Obviously, I want to play as many minutes as I can. On this team
I think I can play 35, 40, 42 minutes, but I didn't want it to seem
he was catering to me. I didn't want to be selfish that way. Now,
though, I think I'm ready to take my place.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his meetings with Wilkens and general manager Pete Babcock,
Rider said, ``Both sides aired some things out. ...I want to be in
there as much as I can and try to help the team win some games. I'm
ready to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I want the offense coming to me, trying to run some
plays in the post, drawing the double teams, finding my teammates.
I know if just stay out there on the wing I'm going to be too
predictable, and we can't let the defense have that advantage. No
one can work in today's rules in total (isolations), so if I get it
in the continuity of the offense that just helps my game,'' Rider
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Blazers know he will be coming at them. ``I talked
to Bonzi (Wells) and Rasheed (Wallace). Bonzi said, `I guess you'll
be coming at me,' and I said, `Of course I will in a situation like
this. Any player will.' But I'm not going to try and take the game
over single-handedly like I would when I was younger and didn't
know better.''

   &UR; ECONOMY13  &LR; _ (Wires) Americans spent more carefully in October,
while workers' productivity advanced strongly. That combination,
which can help keep inflation under control, increases the chances
the Federal Reserve will leave interest rates alone when it meets
next week, economists said. The Commerce Department reported Friday
that retail sales held steady in October, after falling 0.1 percent
in September, as Americans restricted their spending on cars and
furniture but shelled out more for hardware, building supplies and
clothing. In another report that Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has
said he would be watching closely, the Labor Department said the
growth in American workers' productivity _ the amount of output for
each hour of work _ rose at a 4.2 percent annual rate in the
July-September quarter. Unit labor costs, considered a key measure
of wage pressure, rose just 0.6 percent, the slowest quarterly
increase this year. As long as workers are increasingly productive,
employers can afford to pay them without needing to raise prices.
But if productivity falters, pressures for higher wages can result
in inflation, a particular danger Greenspan is on the lookout for.

 Labor Board Shifts Union at Kaiser  &HT;     By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
The National Labor Relations Board forced Kaiser Permanente this
week to replace one of its union partners with a different labor
group that hasn't joined the HMO's labor-management pact.
<P>
   Ironically, the move occurred the same day Kaiser was
publicizing a no-layoff deal with its AFL-CIO partners.
</P>
<P>
   The most immediate effect of the NLRB ruling is that 850 Kaiser
pharmacists in Northern California now will be represented by a
union that has won higher pay for 1,800 pharmacists in Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   The switch also sheds a little light on the closed-door
politicking between Kaiser and the region's health care unions.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser announced its no-layoff pact in a Tuesday press
conference with AFL-CIO President John Sweeney, touting the
agreement as proof that the 2-year-old peace pact between the two &LR; 
sides  &LR; was good for rank and file.
</P>
<P>
   That same night in Oakland, the NLRB finally tabulated the votes
in a union election that was held more than a year earlier. Kaiser
legal objections delayed the count.
</P>
<P>
   The year-old election had pitted Kaiser's AFL-CIO partner union,
Engineers and Scientists of California, against the independent
Guild for Professional Pharmacists. The Guild ended with 58 percent
of the vote, ESC had 37 percent, and 5 percent opted for no union.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser union negotiator Danycq &LR;  Valenzuela explained why Kaiser
contested the count. After ESC spent two years getting more than
half of Kaiser's Northern California pharmacists to sign cards
seeking union representation, the HMO agreed to recognize ESC as
that union.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as that happened, the Guild demanded an election.
Valenzuela said Kaiser felt obliged to stand behind its pledge to
ESC. Now that the NLRB vote has installed the Guild, she is ready
to bargain a new contract while the current pact, negotiated with
ESC, remains in effect.
</P>
<P>
   Wages are likely to be one item on the table. Guild President
Ralph Vogel said Kaiser pharmacists in Northern California get $37
to $38 an hour under the ESC contract. Kaiser's Southern California
pharmacists get an average of $40.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one time, the north was ahead of us in the south, but they
slipped,'' Vogel said.
</P>
<P>
   The reversal in union representation, and Kaiser's role in
trying to prevent the vote count, has caused some bitterness among
pharmacists. Guild partisans wonder why, if Kaiser is so
buddy-buddy with the unions, did it slow the vote count with NLRB
maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   ESC officers, such as Santa Rosa pharmacist Jeff Wong, say their
union spent years trying to organize Kaiser pharmacists while the
Guild swooped in at the last minute and demanded an election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overriding factor was the Guild charged less in dues,''
Wong said, adding that the pro-Guild vote was not a rejection of
the AFL-CIO partnership.
</P>
<P>
   But Vogel believes the Guild won because pharmacists preferred a
union that represents only their profession rather than being
affiliated with AFL-CIO unions that represent many trades. He said
he has no plans to join Kaiser's partnership with the AFL-CIO.

 &HT;    Qualifying dominated by Pontiac
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOMESTEAD, Fla. _ Pontiac's supremacy during first-round
qualifying on Friday for the Pennzoil 400 was so obvious that it
even evoked anger from mild-mannered Jeff Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to get into that Pontiac thing,'' said Gordon,
who drives the No. 24 Chevy. ``It's more obvious than it's ever
been, so I don't need to say a whole lot.''
</P>
<P>
   David Green won his first career Winston Cup pole with a speed
of 155.759 mph at Homestead-Miami on Friday, but the accomplishment
was lost in the controversy over the domination of Pontiac, which
fielded the top five qualifying cars.
</P>
<P>
   John Andretti will share the front row with Green, followed by
Bobby Labonte, rookie Dave Blaney and Ward Burton. Rick Mast was
the top Ford qualifier at sixth, while Gordon drove the fastest
Chevy for the No. 10 position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good to be the first Chevrolet,'' Gordon said. ``That's
all we can do, be the best Chevrolet.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than relishing his first pole in 72 career starts, Green
found himself defending his manufacturer in the post-qualifying
news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts a little bit at times because we (Pontiac) had our
best finish at Phoenix (won by Pontiac No. 20 driver Tony Stewart,
who qualified seventh Friday) and the first thing I read about in
the paper is the Chevrolet and the Ford people saying, `Well,
anybody can drive a Pontiac nowadays in Winston Cup and you are
going to win.' I don't feel like that is a fair statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a cycle. The Chevrolets are probably going to
come out with a better piece and Ford is going to do the same
thing. I don't care who you are in the garage area, from the top to
the bottom, you all have the same pieces. You all have the
capabilities of getting it through that inspection line and making
it the best you possibly can.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time a manufacturer showcased similar mastery was Ford
qualifying the top seven cars in last year's second Rockingham
race. Andretti said Pontiacs have no unfair advantage this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good news and bad news today,'' Andretti said. ``The good
news is that it was a good day for Pontiac. The bad news is, as in
any kind of motorsports, everybody that's not in a Pontiac is going
to tell you (there's an unfair advantage).
</P>
<P>
   ``Just throw a Chevy decklid (on our cars) and we'll go race
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Green, who is 38th in the Winston Cup points standings, switched
from the No. 41 Chevy of Larry Hendrick Motorsports to the No. 45
Pontiac of TylerJet Motorsports in September.
</P>
<P>
   The Owensboro, Ky. native's best finish of the season was 12th
last week in Phoenix. He has not won a race in five years of
Winston Cup racing.

CAB RADIOS BROADCAST WARNINGS, BUT DRIVERS ARE STILL CITED IN
STING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SOMINI SENGUPTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ By the time Mohammed Faruque settled into his cab
just after dawn Friday, the radio of his yellow cab had already
started crackling with exchanges of advice: Take extra care _ pick
up anyone flagging down a cab, no matter the color of their skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course people are careful,'' said Faruque, 45, of Brooklyn,
as he chatted at lunchtime with a clutch of drivers over milky tea
and Marlboro Lights at New Kasturi Pavilion restaurant, a popular
pitstop for South Asian cabbies on Lexington Avenue in Manhattan.
``We are all being extra careful. Anyone who raises his hand, take
him.''
</P>
<P>
   On Day 1 of New York City's widely-publicized undercover sting
against cabdrivers who refuse to pick up minority passengers, this
was not an unexpected response. What was surprising were those who
apparently did not heed the warning.
</P>
<P>
   During the first nine hours of the program, called Operation
Refusal, teams of undercover police officers and taxi inspectors,
black and white, hailed 683 cabs throughout Manhattan. Of those,
five passed up customers on the basis of their race or gender,
police and taxi commission officials said. Among those cited was a
driver on the East Side of Manhattan who refused to pick up a white
woman with two children; instead, the driver picked up an
undercover inspector, a white male, nearby.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to those five, two drivers were cited for refusing
to go a particular destination. One of the would-be riders was a
Hispanic undercover police officer at 32nd Street and Park Avenue.
She asked the driver to go to Kings County Hospital Center in
Brooklyn and was told to get out of the cab, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
said. One of the most frequent complaints against cabdrivers is
that they refuse to go to primarily black and Latino neighborhoods
in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The cabs of the cited drivers were taken to local police
precincts until they could be reclaimed by their owners. The
authorities took away the hack licenses of the drivers who were
cited, pending a hearing at the city Taxi and Limousine Commission.
In addition to those who were cited for refusing customers, 10 were
issued summonses for a range of other violations.
</P>
<P>
   If found guilty of having bypassed a minority passenger, a
cabdriver can be fined and the driver's hack license suspended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the good news in all of this is that in the
overwhelming majority of cases, cabdrivers did what they were
supposed to do,'' Giuliani said Friday at a news briefing in City
Hall, just hours after the crackdown began. ``I think most
cabdrivers in this city attempt to obey the laws and are fair and
equitable in their treatment. Unfortunately, for too long, there
have been a few that haven't, and maybe the warning has reduced
that few to even a smaller number.''
</P>
<P>
   That praise notwithstanding, the mayor was not exactly popular
among drivers at the New Kasturi. Giuliani, they said out, had
already made their lives difficult last year with a series of new
stringent regulations. Friday's crackdown, they asserted, was part
of an effort to earn political points in his potential bid for the
U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an election, and Giuliani just wants to make black
people happy,'' said Rakib Hossain, 34, a driver for more than 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   He quickly added, ``But I don't refuse black people.''

 Small Shops Wary of Men's Wearhouse Entry Into Rental
Formal-Wear  Market 
 &HT;     By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Men's Wearhouse, the 800-pound gorilla of men's suits, is trying to
get the tuxedo rental business all sewn up.
<P>
   After a successful test launch in 10 Seattle stores, the company
has opened tuxedo rental departments in its five Sacramento
locations and is rolling them out to all 27 of its Bay Area stores.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes according to plan, every Men's Wearhouse across the
country _ currently 437 _ will include a formal wear department in
three to five years, a plan that fundamentally will alter the
fragmented sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no one national leader in the industry,'' said Kelly
Armstrong, an analyst with First Union Securities in San Francisco.
Men's Wearhouse's national footprint, brand awareness and sizable
advertising budget give it a leg up on the single-store bridal
boutiques and regional chains that populate the sector, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're (already) known for suits,'' Armstrong said. ``It's
not that big of a leap for a customer to go in and rent a tuxedo
from Men's Wearhouse versus some no-name store.''
</P>
<P>
   Men's Wearhouse is offering attractive prices: $50 to $70 a day
for a full ensemble. The average tux rental in 1996, the latest
year for which information is available, was $72, according to the
International Formalwear Association.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller merchants, not surprisingly, are wary. Men's Wearhouse,
which is regarded as aggressive and well-run, has blanketed the
country with moderate-priced stores known for good customer
service. The suit-seller also spends millions of dollars on TV
advertising _ an unaffordable luxury for most of its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the little guys aren't about to throw in the
handkerchief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody can create a monopoly,'' said Hal
Turner, president of Dick Bruhn Inc. of Hayward, which owns the
local Selix chain. ``We feel good about ourselves _ we've been in
business since 1906.''
</P>
<P>
   As a newcomer, Men's Wearhouse offers only 13 styles of tuxedos,
while Selix offers more than 40, Turner noted.
</P>
<P>
   Turner and other formal wear doyennes say they have the upper
hand because their reputations are established, they have marketing
expertise in the prom and bridal markets, and their staffs are
highly trained in the minutiae of cummerbunds and cuff links.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, the existing tux merchants also have mastered the
complex business of keeping track of thousands of multipart
ensembles as they are shuffled through orders and returns,
fittings, alterations and dry cleanings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like there's a general practitioner who can come in to do
your knees or there's a guy who does nothing but knees _ who would
you go to?'' said Jack Springer, executive director of the
International Formalwear Association.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for smaller players, a boom in the tuxedo business
should blunt any diversion of sales to Men's Wearhouse. The sector
has jumped to $1.2 billion in revenues last year from about $80
million in 1994, propelled by the prom-going members of the huge
Echo Boom generation, according to the formal-wear association.
Rentals represent about 80 percent of total revenues, with sales
accounting for the remainder.
</P>
<P>
   Rapid growth will continue for the foreseeable future because
there are many young Echo Boomers in the pipeline, Springer said.
``Our industry is having the best year we've ever had, and last
year was the second-best,'' he said. Millennium celebrations will
provide an added boost in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Men's Wearhouse, for its part, has high hopes for formal wear.
``There are all kinds of upsides for us,'' said Rich Goldman,
executive vice president of merchandising and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, a company co-founder, believes that his company's share
of the tux market eventually will match its suit share, which has
grown to more than 11 percent from 9 percent in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   One attractive bonus: The profit margin on tux rentals is much
higher than on suit sales. Goldman declined to discuss margins in
detail, but Turner provided this assessment: ``If Men's Wearhouse
can take a tux they were going to sell for $295 and rent it 80
times for $80 dollars (generating $6,400), there's a difference
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Men's Wearhouse has a big job ahead of it as it enters
this new business. While the company has always sold a few tuxedos,
Goldman acknowledges that the rental business is filled with a raft
of logistical obstacles that company planners are just starting to
tackle.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Men's Wearhouse must formulate a national
distribution system that quickly can move tuxes between tailoring,
cleaning, stores and warehouses. It must either set up a network of
reliable dry cleaners or learn to do the job itself, a big jump
into an entirely different business.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high. If a customer winds up with a 42-long
instead of a 42-short on his wedding day, Men's Wearhouse has lost
not only future tux rentals, but potential future sales for its
core tailored-clothing business.
</P>
<P>
   The company's competitors ``are people who have been in this
business a long time and they're formidable,'' said Goldman.
``That's why we're taking three to five years to roll it out
instead of doing it overnight. We want to make sure we're the
best.''
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the tux business' fat margins, perhaps the biggest
draw for Men's Wearhouse is the opportunity to broaden its market
to a new group, teens and twentysomethings.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 percent of rented tuxes are worn to proms, and most of
the rest are for weddings. In contrast with that youthful
demographic, Men's Wearhouse shoppers generally range in age from
mid-30s to upper 40s, Goldman said.
</P>
<P>
   Although young men don't buy a lot of suits, Men's Wearhouse is
betting that a positive experience today will breed return visits
years down the pike.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing in new customers is particularly important for Men's
Wearhouse because it still is battling a negative image acquired
years ago from bad advertising, Goldman said. In the ads, which
left a lasting impression among American consumers, Men's Wearhouse
co-founder and chief executive George Zimmer came across as an
aggressive, fast-talking salesman.
</P>
<P>
   (Springer vividly remembers an ad in which Zimmer exhorted
viewers to buy tuxedos at Men's Wearhouse to avoid renting one
``that some high school kid had vomited on.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``People still think about that Zimmer guy sorta screaming at
them,'' Goldman said. ``People's perceptions tend to change when
they shop at the store.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuxes provide ample opportunity for both impulse buys and
image-building because renters must visit three times _ for the
fitting, the pickup and the return. ``Having three opportunities to
expose people to Men's Wearhouse is a wonderful thing,'' Goldman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Men's Wearhouse will be able to master the tux business
remains to be seen, but early returns are encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of the company's Seattle tux customers showed that 95
percent ``had no problems and were delighted with the experience,''
Goldman said. Two-thirds were first-time Men's Wearhouse customers.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether they would come back to shop, ``an
overwhelming majority said they would consider it, whereas they
might not have before,'' Goldman said.

 What Banking Reform Means for Consumers  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
The banking bill just signed by President Clinton has been hyped as
the biggest revolution in financial regulation in more than half a
century.
<P>
   It ends separations between banking, insurance and securities
brokerage dating from the Depression era and rewrites rules in
areas ranging from consumer privacy to community lending.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the bill merely recognizes what's happening in the
marketplace, where banks, insurance companies and securities firms
already have gotten deeply into each other's businesses. Here are
some questions and answers to help clarify what the bill means for
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: Banks already are buying securities firms and selling insurance.
So what's new here?
</P>
<P>
   A: Federal regulators gradually loosened the separations between
banks, insurance companies and brokerages, but plenty of obstacles
remained. For example, banks generally couldn't sell insurance
directly, but only through independent affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   The new law sweeps aside those barriers, allowing different
types of financial services companies to merge freely and sell a
full range of products.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR;  Q: What changes will consumers see in the marketplace?
</P>
<P>
   &LR; a  &LR;  A: Bank watchers predict a wave of mergers until a handful
of giant, nationwide companies dominate an integrated financial
services market. A few regional companies and many small,
single-product firms also will remain. ``There are going to be some
big guys who try to do everything and some small guys who want to
do one thing,'' said Todd Conover, managing partner of San
Francisco's Starmont Asset Management and one of the nation's top
bank regulators during the Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will prices for financial products and services rise?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's a matter of debate. Industry representatives say that
greater economies of scale of the emerging financial-services
giants will push prices down. Consumer groups insist that the
near-monopoly status of the new leviathans will give them more
power to raise fees and interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR;  Q: Banks were separated from insurers and brokerages to keep
deposits safe. Won't banks become riskier when the barriers come
down?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Regulators backed the bill, arguing that large,
diversified financial companies would be able to absorb problems in
one part of their business. And the law incorporates certain
protections, so-called firewalls, to keep financial problems in one
part of a company from spreading.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups counter that risk multiplies when a company
combines banking, insurance and brokerage. It's almost certain
though that the government wouldn't allow a giant financial
conglomerate to fail. As in the savings and loan crisis, depositers
would be bailed out. ``It's the taxpayers who would end up footing
the bill,'' said Frank Torres, a banking expert at Consumers Union
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR;  Q: How does the new law affect consumer privacy?
</P>
<P>
   A: The new law's privacy protections are weak. Consumers have a
limited right to require companies to keep their personal data
private. Loopholes allow financial companies to share personal
consumer data freely with affiliates and, in some cases, outside
marketing companies.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR;  Q: Will banks still have to lend to low-income communities?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: The law chips away at Community Reinvestment Act
requirements to lend in all neighborhoods, including low- and
moderate-income communities. Instead of examinations every year or
two, regulators would review the lending records of small banks
once every four or five years.

 A Bunker Mentality at Microsoft Campus  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; Microsoft is in no mood to settle.
<P>
   Sure, Bill Gates and his minions say Microsoft Corp. is ready to
compromise with antitrust authorities after a judge's ruling that
the Godzilla of software-makers has been stomping all over its
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   But the sentiment behind the scenes at the company's
headquarters in Redmond is of wounded pride and hurt feelings and a
growing determination to fight for what Microsoft employees believe
to be right _ that their company is a tough but fair competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to have your government make claims you don't
believe,'' said Steve Guggenheimer, director of marketing for
Microsoft's consumer commerce group. ``We know we haven't done
anything wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   He echoed the stand that Gates laid out at the company's annual
shareholder meeting Wednesday. Although Microsoft is willing to
seek common ground with federal regulators, Gates insisted that
this would not come at the expense of being able to freely add new
features to its products.
</P>
<P>
   This particularly applies to the Windows operating system, which
runs on about 90 percent of the world's personal computers. The
inclusion of Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser, and its
subsequent effect on Netscape Communications Corp., is at the heart
of the government's antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   But for Gates, as well as for most of Microsoft's 17,000 local
workers, the central issue is the right to ``innovate.'' They see
themselves as champions of good, old-fashioned American principles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Principles are important,'' Guggenheimer said. ``If the
company can find a settlement that's fair to both sides, great. But
otherwise, we should fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, rank-and-file Microsofties are doing their best to
show a stiff upper lip. In conversations on the company's sprawling
``campus'' and at favorite haunts like the nearby Pro Sports Club,
they toe the official line that the antitrust case is no big deal
and that they just want to get on with their work.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think that we're here trying to beat down the
competition every day,'' said a worker in Microsoft's games
division who identified himself only as Humberto, sitting in the
cafeteria. ``The reality is that we're just doing our jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The lawsuit doesn't matter,'' said a worker in the Windows
group who gave his name only as Dan, while on his way into the gym.
``It's not a distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Microsoft employees have been avidly debating the
merits of the case around the office and in lunchroom confabs,
according to sources, and pay close attention to how recent
headlines have affected the company's stock (which isn't much).
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft workers have been instructed by the company not to
discuss the case with reporters without prior clearance, which is
why all those who agreed to be interviewed at length tended to
sound as if they were reading from the same script. Others refused
to comment.
</P>
<P>
   And for those who find themselves in situations where questions
are unavoidable, the in-house newsletter, MicroNews, provided
employees with ``answers that explain where Microsoft stands on
these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, Microsoft's stance is that the company has done
nothing wrong, has not tried to eliminate Netscape as a competitor
and does not have a monopoly in the computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft President Steve Ballmer reinforced the company's spin
last week in an internal memo e-mailed to employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This antitrust case will be a long process, and we are in it
for the long haul,'' he wrote. ``Bill and I would like nothing more
than to resolve this today, but we believe we must stand up for a
vitally important principle _ the freedom of every company to
innovate and improve its products for its customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Murray, the Microsoft spokesman who represented the company
through much of the antitrust trial in Washington, D.C., expanded
on this notion during a lengthy interview. He used the example of
speech-recognition software, which enables users to speak directly
to their computers, and other ``smart'' appliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are stand-alone programs out there, but we're working on
a very robust speech-recognition application,'' Murray said. ``The
government lawsuit says that if we bundle it into the system,
they'll take us to court.''
</P>
<P>
   There's the rub. Microsoft says it must be able to add such
features as it pleases. But the reality is that if Windows were
equipped with an easy-to-use speech-recognition program, it would
certainly discourage would-be rivals from developing a similar
product that might be better.
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson mulls
potential remedies, Microsoft is trying to convince all who will
listen that free enterprise must take priority over intrusive
government regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that is awkward but completely legally true
is that if your products are phenomenally popular or simply better
than other people's products, there is nothing wrong with that,''
Murray said. ``Microsoft's products are popular because people
choose them.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless a settlement is reached beforehand, the next step is for
the government to file its response early next month to Jackson's
``findings of fact,'' which stated that Microsoft enjoys a monopoly
in the computer business.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft would then file its response in January, followed in
short order by the government's reply and then the company's reply
to the reply.
</P>
<P>
   A final decision from the judge could come in March or April of
next year, and his remedy _ which could range from a slap on the
wrist to a breakup of the company _ could come several months
later.
</P>
<P>
   If either side were to appeal the judge's decision, the case
could drag on for three or four more years.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Cohen, who oversees Microsoft's dealings with Silicon
Valley startups, feels that the longer the case is drawn out, the
more other technology firms will come to see things Microsoft's
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the companies that have been fueling this case are
going to be in a world of hurt if the government starts regulating
products,'' he said. ``It almost seems like people are ignoring
that there's competition.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a constant refrain among Microsoft employees _ that the
software and computer industries are boiling with competition,
which is evidence of a free and fair marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   They tend to overlook other aspects of Judge Jackson's findings
of fact, such as Microsoft all but dictating terms to
computer-makers for use of Windows and its efforts to prevent
alternative software platforms, such as Java, from taking off.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of people here agrees that Microsoft has done
nothing wrong and that the `facts' are a farce,'' said Dave Jacobs,
a former Microsoft employee who still works on campus testing
Windows products for a leading Japanese electronics firm. ``It's
like a direct insult.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that some Microsofties are embracing conspiracy
theories to explain the government's dogged pursuit of monopoly
charges. Such theories include resentment on the part of
politicians because Microsoft hadn't been throwing around enough
cash in Washington, as well as a personal vendetta against Gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's hoping they'll fight,'' Jacobs said. ``Nobody wants
a settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes many investors at this week's shareholder meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they won't lie down,'' said Marlene Clark, a Los
Angeles restaurant manager whose stake in Microsoft has ``grown
enormously'' since 1986. ``They're a tough, fair competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gates is a smart guy,'' noted Gideon Parke, a Washington state
ferry worker. ``He earned his way to where he is. He should keep
doing what he's been doing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the community surrounding Microsoft's headquarters _ a
suburban wasteland of shopping centers, chain stores and strip
malls _ local merchants also are taking an active interest in the
outcome of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of our customers are from Microsoft,'' said Steve Woody,
sales manager at BMW of Bellevue. ``What's good for Microsoft is
good for us.''
</P>
<P>
   And down the road at Savi, which offers free lattes with its
selection of upscale casual clothing, employees point out that
Microsoft's daily stock price is a regular feature of local radio
broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing isn't hurting them, so it isn't hurting local
businesses,'' said Lisa Halpern, a writer for the store's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   So where does it go from here? Murray, the Microsoft spokesman,
wishes he knew. But after spending nearly two hours detailing the
company's position on various points related to the antitrust case,
his earlier interest in reaching a settlement seemed to diminish.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are places where Microsoft has competed aggressively,
but we haven't done anything illegal,'' he said. ``At the end of
the legal day, the courts will find that we have acted fairly.''

METS PREPARE THEIR BEST PITCH FOR GRIFFEY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Md., Canada, Wash.)   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Yankees have all but completed a new contract
with Jim Leyritz, while the Mets have made a small trade and
continue to explore the long-shot possibility of trading for
Seattle's Ken Griffey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz, who hit the final home run of 1999, has agreed in
principle to a deal for the 2000 season, a baseball official said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz, who turns 36 next month, hit a home run in the eighth
inning of Game 4 of the Yankees' World Series sweep of Atlanta and
now has 8 home runs in 61 at-bats in the postseason. With the
Yankees, he will be a third-string catcher, a part-time designated
hitter and a backup at first base.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have been mostly concerned with fine-tuning their
roster, but the Mets are contemplating big changes. Pat Gillick,
the Seattle general manager, has indicated that he has received one
particularly interesting offer for Griffey, the All-Star center
fielder with 398 career home runs, and it appears the Mets
originated the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The offer may well include the Mets' closer, Armando Benitez,
because Seattle needs a closer. Benitez had 128 strikeouts in 78
innings, 22 saves and played an integral role as the Mets qualified
for the playoffs for the first time since 1988. But some members of
the organization have concerns about Benitez's approach to the
game. Translated: They don't like him.
</P>
<P>
   Mets officials surprised executives of other teams with their
willingness to discuss Benitez's availability at the general
managers' meetings, which ended on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets could also offer outfielder Roger Cedeno and perhaps
pitcher Octavio Dotel. Without identifying the team forwarding the
interesting offer, Gillick suggested that he planned to talk to
that team again last night.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Mets have the most attractive offer for Griffey for
the moment, they may be far from making a deal; most baseball
officials think the Cincinnati Reds eventually will be the most
competitive bidders for Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Mets will discuss trading Benitez, that does not
mean General Manager Steve Phillips, who made what turned out to be
a great deal to get Benitez, will ultimately be willing to deal the
hard-throwing right-hander.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets were willing Friday to swap outfielder Jermaine
Allensworth, who batted .219 in 40 games for them, for Jon Nunnally
of the Boston Red Sox, a left-handed-hitting outfielder who mostly
played in Class AAA Pawtucket last season. Nunnally has a
reputation for playing hard and he has versatility. Because he is
out of options, it stands to reason that he will be part of the
team next year if he performs adequately in spring training.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets still want to re-sign first baseman John Olerud, but
Phillips said the team was prepared to pursue alternatives if
Olerud signed with Seattle. Friday was the first day free agents
could sign with different teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have our plans in place,'' Phillips said, ``and we'll have
to see how this goes. Again, timing is an issue. What we don't want
to do is get caught holding the bag'' if Olerud leaves the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' options most likely include the pursuit of Toronto
first baseman Carlos Delgado or David Segui, the free-agent first
baseman.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud, who is from suburban Seattle, played at Washington
State. Gillick was instrumental in coaxing him to sign his first
professional contract with Toronto a decade ago. Said Gillick:
``We're looking for a first baseman, that's for sure. I would think
he's an attractive-looking first baseman. We'll just see what
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have made contact with David Cone, a former Met who has
been with the Yankees since late in 1995. Baseball officials with
the Baltimore Orioles will meet Friday to discuss a possible offer
to the free-agent pitcher, among other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Executives who have dealt extensively with George Steinbrenner,
the Yankees' principal owner, say Cone's future with the Yankees
will be determined in the moments after Steinbrenner learns that
either the Mets or the Orioles are serious about signing the
veteran pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``If George can't stand the idea of Cone with the Mets or any
other team,'' said one baseball official, ``then he'll get a deal
done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees and the Mets will be involved next week with
Kazuhiro Sasaki, a 32-year-old right-handed reliever who is a free
agent after saving 229 games in Japan. Sasaki throws hard and
possesses a hard-breaking splitter, but he also is coming off arm
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips indicated Sasaki would throw for Mets officials at Shea
Stadium on Wednesday and would be working out later in the week in
Tampa, Fla., where the Yankees' player development offices are
situated.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball officials believe Sasaki's agent will try to negotiate
a deal for between $4 million and $6 million a season. Seattle and
the Los Angeles Dodgers may also be interested. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees will eventually announce another deal that is all
but completed: the reliever Mike Stanton will sign a three-year
contract in the range of $2.5 million a season. ... The Mets
continue to try to deal Rickey Henderson. Tony La Russa, who
managed Henderson in Oakland, and the St. Louis Cardinals could be
a natural suitor for the outfielder, as they try to acquire a pure
leadoff hitter. ... Mets outfielder Darryl Hamilton has demanded a
trade. General Manager steve Phillips believes he did so primarily
to negotiate the right to a limited no-trade clause. The Mets have
until March 15 to trade Hamilton, but Phillips expects the player
to withdraw the demand before then, after some contract
discussions. ``Unless something else happens,'' Phillips said, ``I
expect him to be a Met'' in 2000. &QL;

<P>
   GROS MORNE, Haiti _ The sound of raindrops heralds fear and
sleepless nights for Nicolas Tertilus and his neighbors. They live
atop a cliff overlooking the Mancelle River, which they watch swell
with torrents of water flowing down the treeless mountain slopes.
They hear the currents rush past the cliff, gouging chunks of dirt
from the base and making the earth tremble.
</P>
<P>
   The erosion below has also worn down the 31 families who live
above. Their backyards have been reduced to a sliver of soil.
Outhouses, kitchens and bedrooms have crashed to the riverbed. The
cliff is a sheer drop, smooth as glass, topped by a ragged edge of
broken soil and tangles of tree roots and pipes.
</P>
<P>
   Some people will not sleep in their homes when it rains, seeking
shelter with relatives. Women hang their laundry on the bushes
lining the cliff's edge but keep a safe distance, tossing the
clothes onto the branches and plucking them back with a broomstick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I built a wall two months ago to protect my children from the
edge,'' said Tertilus, a tailor whose house is now just a few yards
from the edge. ``Very soon, that will go too. In two or three years
all these houses could be lost.''
</P>
<P>
   The cliffside drama is both metaphor and microcosm of Haiti's
predicament. Decades of corrupt and dictatorial rule left the
country rotting while millions of dollars in aid were snatched up
by officials. The current government is saddled with debt from
those years, and the lingering paralysis makes it difficult to
improve roads, sanitation and other public works.
</P>
<P>
   Tertilus and his neighbors belong to a committee of residents
that has written to President Rene Preval and other officials
hoping to get a retaining wall to save the houses and protect the
national highway, town square and marketplace that lie in the path
of the encroaching erosion.
</P>
<P>
   But their pleas have gone unanswered. The government has been
paralyzed since 1997 from political infighting that has left the
nation with no legislature, no budget and no access to millions of
dollars in international aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day everybody sees they have a government with no
respect for the people,'' said Jean Gaston, a teacher active in the
committee. ``Regardless of the fact that there has been no budget,
the government buys new cars. They pay their ministers. They are
spending money. So they can spend money for this too.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior government officials said they were aware of the problems
in Gros Morne, a rural region about 125 miles north of the capital.
But they said the government could not do much until elections in
March. At best, it may take temporary measures to relocate the
families, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, there are so many urgent cases to take care
of,'' said Prime Minister Jacques Edouard Alexis. ``But until we
return to a normal political situation, we cannot have access to
the funds we need to take care of the major problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by their inability to budge the government, the
townspeople resorted to a desperate measure: they decided to move
river instead. Passing the hat for gas money, they got a bulldozer
from another town and sent it to the riverbed, where for two weeks
in June they dug a new channel and pushed mounds of dirt and stone
between the water and the cliff.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we did it, it was starting to break down, because we had a
rainy month,'' said Andre Altidor, a shopkeeper whose store is on
the cliff. ``It just started to wash away. It reminded me of a
saying in Creole: `You wash your hands and dry them in the dirt.'''
</P>
<P>
   The environmental calamities and administrative neglect that
have plagued much of the country are abundantly evident in Gros
Morne, a town of 20,000. For years, people cut down trees for
charcoal, deforesting 97 percent of the nation's land. The rainy
season brings mountainside erosion, rivers gorged with water and
more erosion along the water's path.
</P>
<P>
   Public services are unreliable. Running water is rare. There are
few phones. With the town's generator sputtering since February,
the nighttime streets are saturated in a darkness broken by
hundreds of flickering candles.
</P>
<P>
   People recall a time before the cliff, when a gentle slope led
to the river, which was lined with palm trees. The cliff began to
develop about 20 years ago, soon after a hurricane whose floods
eroded much of the hillside.
</P>
<P>
   But for most of the intervening years, the problems on the cliff
were seen as a personal tragedy affecting a handful of unlucky
homeowners. A government engineer visited the town and drew up a
plan for a protective wall. But without the $133,000 needed to
build it, the plan existed only on paper.
</P>
<P>
   About two years ago, heavy rains brought down large chunks of
the cliff. By then, Martin Floristil had abandoned his bedroom
inside his parents' home. One night, as he lay in his bed in an
adjoining room, he was jolted by a troubling noise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Around 10 o'clock I could start to hear soil falling piece by
piece,'' he said. ``Then there was a loud roar, and I got up and
ran out. The house trembled, and my old room fell off the cliff.''
</P>
<P>
   All that remains of his old bedroom is a cracked slab of
concrete floor, where a rusted mattress frame juts out over the
edge. The room where he once sought shelter is now used only to
take the occasional bath, its floor and walls lined with cracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can still feel the vibrations whenever the river swells,''
he said. ``You can feel the soil moving underneath.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, the residents formed their committee to
spur the government into action. They were joined by several Roman
Catholic nuns who brought with them skills from in decades of work
in the inner cities of Washington and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Patricia Dillon, who spent 25 years in the South Bronx
organizing tenants against indifferent landlords and violent drug
dealers, encountered the challenge of her life in Gros Morne. Some
people, accustomed to years of the government doing nothing, were
grimly and helplessly resigned to fate.
</P>
<P>
   She knew how to rally communities _ becoming a link between the
town and other religious and social justice groups that began to
help with reforestation projects and petitions to the Haitian
government. The committee found reports about the wall that was
never built and began translating the documents from the official
language of French into the popular idiom of Creole.
</P>
<P>
   ``For poor people to gain power, they need information,'' the
sister said in a telephone interview from New York, where she was
undergoing medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   One encouraging sign is that the townspeople have found a sense
of civic mission, much like many other grass-roots groups emerging
throughout the country to press for public efficiency and
accountability.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people here are ready to do all we can,'' said the Rev.
Ronel Charelus, the pastor of the local Catholic church. ``We can
get to work. It's our situation. It's our lives. It's our town at
stake. But the money for this project, that is the one thing we
don't have.''

 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOLDEN, Colo. _ In the weeks before the massacre at Columbine
High School, the two teen-age killers made a videotape in which
they chillingly described the act they were about to commit and
assured future viewers that they were acting alone and that no one
knew what they were planning.
</P>
<P>
   Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris thanked two local men for helping
them obtain a weapon they would later use when they burst into the
school on April 20 and killed 13 people before killing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to ensure that none of his or Harris' friends or
family members would be charged in the shootings, Klebold, looking
directly into the camera, said: ``Let me tell you this much, they
have no clue. So don't blame them and arrest them for what we
did.''
</P>
<P>
   The remarks by Klebold and others by Harris were revealed Friday
during an emotional hearing in a district court here, where Mark E.
Manes, 22, a computer systems manager, was sentenced to six years
in prison for selling one of the guns used at Columbine to Klebold.
The sentencing guidelines could have allowed the judge, Henry
Nieto, to impose a prison term three times as long. The videotape
was not shown at the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Three months ago, Manes pleaded guilty to two felony charges,
selling a handgun to a juvenile and possessing a dangerous weapon.
</P>
<P>
   The judge imposed a sentence of six years for the first charge
and three for the second, but ordered that they be served
concurrently.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining his decision, Nieto appeared to be balancing the
interests of both the victims and Manes, saying, ``I don't believe
anything we do here today will comfort the victims.'' But referring
to the charge of selling a weapon to a juvenile, he added, ``This
crime demonstrates the maximum harm that can occur from a violation
of this statute.''
</P>
<P>
   Manes spent most of the three-hour hearing seated at the defense
table with his head down. Before Nieto imposed his sentence, Manes
stood and faced him and said, emphatically, he had no idea what
Harris and Klebold were planning when they bought the gun and
practiced shooting it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was horrified,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``There is no way I can adequately express my sorrow
to the families of the victims of Columbine. It is something I will
regret the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The sentencing followed more than an hour of wrenching testimony
by family members of nine of the victims in the shootings, many of
whom characterized Manes as no less guilty of the killings than
Harris and Klebold, and all of whom asked Nieto to impose the
longest sentence possible.
</P>
<P>
   Several broke down and cried as they spoke; and two families
used stirring musical videotaped presentations of their child who
was killed to emphasize the depth of their loss.
</P>
<P>
   In addressing the court, Kristen Townsend, whose sister Lauren
Townsend was gunned down, spoke with tears in her eyes and said:
``I want a full sentence not to seek revenge but to keep some
dignity for my sister's life and her death.''
</P>
<P>
   Some relatives used the opportunity to ask Nieto to send a
message that would discourage future illegal acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court should impose a sentence which will send a message
of deterrence to others who might consider providing dangerous
weapons to youngsters in violation of the law,'' said Betty Cook,
the aunt of another victim, Isaiah Shoels, reading a statement from
the boy's parents, Michael and Vonda.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had our way the defendant would never be allowed on the
streets again. Life is too precious for anyone to contribute in any
manner to the death of another.''
</P>
<P>
   One parent, Thomas Mauser, whose son, Daniel, was killed, said:
``I ask you clearly to make a statement that this will deter other
crimes,'' he said. ``Some would say I am scapegoating Manes for a
terrible crime. But no. I've had to think about that a lot. It is
clear to me what his role is, and his sentence should reflect what
that was.''
</P>
<P>
   In arguing for a maximum penalty, Steven L. Jensen, the
Jefferson County prosecutor, tried to convey to the judge that
absent Manes' relationship with the killers, the tragedy might not
have occurred.
</P>
<P>
   As his only witness, the lead detective in the case, Kate
Battan, recounted the chronology of how the killers, who were 17 at
the time, met Manes at a weekend gun show in January and how he
purchased for Klebold a Tec-9 semiautomatic handgun for $500 and
later _ the day before the killings _ 100 rounds of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Largely through information she obtained from an interview with
Manes, she described the transaction and three trips he and the
killers made to a target-practice range. On one occasion, she said,
Harris exploded ammunition into the trunk of a tree, destroying it,
and said, ``Imagine that in someone's [expletive) brain.''
</P>
<P>
   She also quoted the killers from a videotape that the
authorities found in one of the killer's homes days after the
massacre. It was apparently made sometime between Klebold's
purchase of the Tec-9 and the day of the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   By Ms. Battan's account, the tape was something of a suicide
note in that the two clearly left the impression they would die in
carrying out their deadly mission.
</P>
<P>
   But as a critical component of the taped message, Harris and
Klebold assertively thanked Manes, and another man, Philip Duran,
for helping them obtain the Tec-9.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I'd like to thank you, Mark and Phil,'' Ms. Battan said
Klebold said on the videotape.
</P>
<P>
   And as if to exonerate them from any culpability in the
shootings, Harris said on the tape, according to Ms. Battan,
``Yeah, you know it's not their fault.''
</P>
<P>
   And Klebold asserted that if Manes and Duran had not helped him
and Harris obtain a weapon, ``We would have found someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Duran, who worked at Black Jack Pizza with Harris and Klebold,
was with Manes when the deal for the handgun was made; he also
accompanied them all three times to the shooting range.
</P>
<P>
   He is scheduled to be arraigned in 10 days on the same charges
that Manes faced.
</P>
<P>
   Led through questions by Jensen, Ms. Battan also told the court
how the killers wanted to make it clear that they had hidden their
plans from all their friends and members of their families. As if
speaking from the grave, knowing they would die in the slaughter,
they implored the authorities they need not seek out Manes, Duran
or anyone else for involvement in the shootings to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't blame them or arrest them for what we did,'' Klebold
said on the videotape, according to Ms. Battan. ``Our friends and
family, no one had a clue.''

</P>
<P>
   FARRELL-DANCE (Undated) _ ``You see her yield completely,
fainting with a soft abandon in a supported deep back bend, and
before you see the recovery, she is already standing apart, mild
and free, as if in thought.'' The dancer was the teenage Suzanne
Farrell, in 1964. The writer was Edwin Denby, one of the great
chroniclers of the New York City Ballet, where Ms. Farrell danced.
The ballet he wrote about was ``Meditation,'' created for her by
George Balanchine, whose choosing of the young dancer as his muse
was to become a central metaphor in the lives of Ms. Farrell,
Balanchine and American ballet. Now Ms. Farrell, who retired from
the stage in 1989, has become a muse of another sort. Since 1993,
she has taught summer master classes at the Kennedy Center &UR;  &LR; in
Washington. By Jennifer Dunning. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TOPSY-TURVY-FILM (Undated) _ The Gilbert and Sullivan in Mike
Leigh's new film, ``Topsy-Turvy,'' are astonishingly realistic; and
their theater is one that contemporary playwrights, composers and
directors will find instantly familiar. By Wendy Wasserstein.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ANY-GIVEN-SUNDAY-FILM (Santa Monica Calif.) _ ``Any Given
Sunday,'' is Oliver Stone's film about pro football, which opens
Dec. 22. By Bruce Newman. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   WINONA-RYDER-FILMS (Undated) _ In the pantheon of film
actresses, Winona Ryder is becoming almost as well known for her
eyes as Bette Davis. Ms. Ryder's, of course, are brown, not blue.
At the moment, they are fixed on the poster for her new film,
``Girl, Interrupted,'' which is based on Susanna Kaysen's
best-selling memoir of a two-year stay as a teenager at McLean
Hospital, the private psychiatric clinic outside Boston. By Jennet
Conant.
</P>
<P>
   EMILY-WATSON-FILMS (Undated) _ Judging from her cinematic
repertory, one might think that the actress Emily Watson would be
tiny, vulnerable, an imperiled sprite of a woman. Her roles _ the
tormented young wife of a paraplegic in the 1997 film ``Breaking
the Waves''; the volcanic, terminally ill cellist Jacqueline du Pre
in ``Hilary and Jackie''; the impoverished Irish housewife in
``Angela's Ashes,'' opening Dec. 22 _ seem to call for someone
small whose intellectual and spiritual presence eventually
dominates the room. Surely, Ms. Watson must be tiny, doll-like and
fragile in real life, too. But she turns out to be a beanstalk,
more than 5-foot-9 in sneakers. By Alex Kuczynski. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   SLEEPY-HOLLOW-FILM (New York) _ Tim Burton, in his suite at the
Regency Hotel here, after a day of interviews to promote his new
film, ``Sleepy Hollow,'' appears to be equal parts funeral
director, mad scientist and Swifty Lazar. He does not mind jokes
about his hair looking as if it has been combed with a Mixmaster.
He's just glad he has a head. By the end of his new film, so few
cast members do. Based on Washington Irving's classic ``The Legend
of Sleepy Hollow,'' this film is Burton's chance to make the kind
of semi-cheesy horror films produced by Hammer Films in England in
the 1950s and '60s so revered by hipsters today. By Frank DeCaro.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   HURRICANE-FILM (New York) _ ``I feel good about the work,'' said
Denzel Washington, seated at one of the prime banquettes in Jean
Georges restaurant at Columbus Circle in Manhattan. That film is
``The Hurricane,'' based on the story of Rubin (Hurricane) Carter,
the middleweight boxer who spent 19 years in New Jersey prisons for
murders he insisted he did not commit, until a federal judge
overturned his conviction and freed him. The film will be released
by Universal Studios on Dec. 29 in New York and Los Angeles to
qualify for Academy Award consideration. By Rick Lyman. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MOVIES-ENDINGS (Undated) _ Movies used to end. Audiences knew
the end was near when two lovers walked into a sunset, a cowpoke
rode off into a sunset, or Gloria Swanson descended the stairs in
her mansion on Sunset Boulevard. For those who couldn't take a
hint, filmmakers invariably flashed the phrase ``THE END.'' Like a
bartender flipping the lights on after last call, ``THE END'' told
moviegoers to beat it, pal. Such endings provided a punctuation
mark, finality, what Oprah acolytes call closure. But now ``THE
END'' is in foreclosure. Movies dribble out their final moments
like an NBA point guard trying to kill the clock. By Franz Lidz and
Steve Rushin. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   HOLIDAY-MOVIES (Undated) _ Who doesn't love the holiday movies?
Who can watch ``It's a Wonderful Life'' and not feel a surge of
exultation when the friends of the desperate George Bailey pour
into his home, and we see all the good he has done in his life
abundantly repaid? Such moments leave us all aglow, reassured that
in a world of tribulation, it is possible to find good will among
men. By Jamie Malanowski. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   FILMS-CITIES (Undated) _ The movie directorial profession is
wide enough to encompass wanderers and regionalists, pastoralists
and city rats. ``We're all gypsies,'' the nomadic David Lean said
in a 1985 interview, but some directors repeatedly gravitate toward
their old metropolitan haunts, even if most eventually range beyond
them. By Graham Fuller. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   COVEN-DANCE (New York) _ The carefree, pluralistic spirit of the
1960s didn't die; it possessed the body of Ellie Covan. As
executive director of Dixon Place, a performance space she founded
in 1986, Ms. Covan provides a venue where choreographers, actors,
writers, performance artists and musicians can present works in
progress. By William Harris. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BOULEZ-MUSIC (Undated) _ Pierre Boulez will probably never shake
off the reputation he earned in his 20s as a fearsome polemicist on
behalf of the most complex contemporary music, including his own.
He emerged from Europe in the 1950s as the leading advocate of the
post-Webern school of serialism, or 12-tone music, or _ to use the
term Boulez preferred in his theoretical writings _ dodecaphonic
music. By Anthony Tommasini. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   SMETANA-MUSIC (Undated) _ Bedrich Smetana's music seems split
between public and private sectors. ``The Bartered Bride'' and ``Ma
Vlast'' are household names in every musical family, but how many
of us know that this 19th-century Bohemian composer wrote
two-thirds of his 300 compositions for the piano and that an awful
lot of them are polkas? More than 30 pieces are called just that,
and many more are polkas in everything but name. By Bernard
Holland. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   STAN-FREBERG-MUSIC (Los Angeles) _ In the symphony of famous
comic voices, Stan Freberg's is a Stradivarius. To see his rubber
mouth, off-center jaw and wild eyes in person _ and hear that
sonorous, ever-shifting voice _ is to remember hours and years of
laughter that began in his head and went straight to your ear, and
belly. Now 73, Freberg is the grand old satirist of radio and
records. He began his career in the 1950s by puncturing the
stifling conventions of the Eisenhower era and lampooning the
prevailing pop-culture effluvia of everything from ``Dragnet'' to
the wailing androgynous singer Johnnie Ray. By Todd S. Purdum.
(Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   DR.-DRE-MUSIC (Undated) _ Andre Young, better known as Dr. Dre,
hasn't exactly been silent since he released his first solo album,
``The Chronic,'' in 1992. He produced Snoop Doggy Dogg's debut
album, Tupac Shakur's ``All Eyez on Me,'' and Eminem's ``The Slim
Shady LP,'' all multimillion sellers, while rapping on their albums
and co-starring in their video clips. But on his new album, ``Dr.
Dre 2001'' (Interscope 069490486), Dr. Dre sounds defensive, as if
he's worried that hip-hop considers him a has-been. By Jon Pareles.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   VAN-DYCK-ART (Undated) _ Anthony Van Dyck's portraits, which
dominate an exhibition at the Royal Academy until Dec. 10 in London
on the 400th anniversary of his birth, provide marvelous company
while delivering a bit of a millennial comeuppance. Who knew that
portraits made in the early 16th century could feel quite so
immediate and of the moment? By Roberta Smith. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   EGYPT-IN-BOSTON (Boston) _ ``Egypt in Boston'' is what five of
this city's cultural institutions call their thematic collaboration
this year, described as a pioneering venture into ``cultural
tourism'' and ``an unprecedented look at Egyptian culture.'' By
Deborah Weisgall. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   DREAMSCAPE-ARCH (Undated) _ Compared with other art forms,
architecture has remained remarkably impervious to the influence of
Freudian ideas. For many people, buildings still represent the
world of external reality: the faces we put on in public, the
appeals to science, civility, God, gravitas, nature, the past, the
future and other authorities outside the self. Subjective states _
dreams, fantasies, memories, fears and desires _ have been largely
contained within the compass of interior design. Among younger
architects, however, there is growing determination to break out of
this binary inside-outside structure. And the computer has emerged
as a highly effective tool for achieving that goal. By Herbert
Muschamp. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-E.R. (Burbank, Calif.) _ One of the most successful and
enduring series in television history _ which barely made it to the
air in 1994 because NBC executives at the time doubted the
viability of a hospital show _ ``E.R.'' has undergone radical
surgery this season after weakening considerably last year, partly
because of the departure of George Clooney. The patient has
rebounded and maintains high ratings, but the aging process leads
to vulnerability. (Among viewers 18 to 49, the series has actually
declined this year.) By Bernard Weinraub. (Moved).

   PAPERBACKS (Undated) (Moved.)

   &UR; TRAVEL (`t' category) &LR;

<P>
   TRAVEL-MEXICO (Mexico City) _ Driving into Mexico? $800 deposit,
por favor. By Sam Dillon. (Moved).
</P>

   TRAVEL-BRIEFS (Undated) _ Scottsdale resort joins a golf messa;
In the Alps, precautions against avalanches; National Trust offers
a guide to winter sites; Newark keeps Tibetan artistry alive.

ANOTHER `E-DODGERS' IN SCOREBOOK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 &HT;     By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ And the Dodgers were looking so good for _ how
long was it? _ two whole weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The front-office takeover by Bob Daly, trusted friend of Peter
O'Malley. The trade of bad boy Raul Mondesi for nice guy Shawn
Green. The rumors of an Eric Young trade. The rumors of key
free-agent signings.
</P>
<P>
   For Dodgers fans, down on the team since the Mike Piazza trade,
it has been a citywide sugar rush. Suddenly Los Angeles was looking
forward to opening day again (April 3, 2000, at Montreal; mark your
Christmas calendar). Amazing how quickly the metropolitan mood can
change.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes news the club might lose Adrian Beltre to free agency
as punishment for breaking major-league rules by signing the
Dominican third baseman to a contract before his 16th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Any number of things might happen as a result of the accusation
by Beltre's agent and the coming investigation by the baseball
commissioner's office.
</P>
<P>
   They range from insignificant (rulebreaking found to be careless
but inadvertent, Dodgers pay a slap-on-the-wrist fine) to highly
inconvenient (rulebreaking found to be willful, Dodgers forced to
outbid other teams to keep Beltre) to disastrous (rulebreaking
found to fit a pattern of deceit, Dodgers wave goodbye to young
infield cornerstone and are barred from signing foreign players for
a time).
</P>
<P>
   But whatever happens and whomever is to blame, it's another
embarrassment for the organization, more evidence things had spun
out of control before the Murdoch regime took over.
</P>
<P>
   The latest scandal is a reminder of the Dodgers' illegal
signings of Cuban players in 1996 and 1998, the punishment for
which cost the team two prospects and a $200,000 fine in June.
</P>
<P>
   It's a reminder of the $10,000 fine the club had to pay after
neglecting to tell the commissioner's office _ as the rules require
_ that it was absorbing part of Mel Rojas' contract after trading
the pitcher to the Detroit Tigers in April.
</P>
<P>
   It's a reminder of then-general manager Tom Lasorda's ignorance
of the free-agency rules that could have left the Dodgers with
nothing to show for trading Paul Konerko and Dennis Reyes to get
Jeff Shaw in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   It's a reminder of whatever other mess shook your confidence in
L.A.'s team.
</P>
<P>
   By trading a minor-leaguer Friday to get Florida Marlins third
baseman Kevin Orie (for ``corner infield depth,'' general manager
Kevin Malone said), the Dodgers seemed to admit guilt in the Beltre
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, a number of questions remain because Dodgers executives
aren't saying much beyond a written statement that rules and
integrity are good things, and Beltre is out of touch in the
Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Did a Dodgers scout or executive dream up the deceit when Beltre
was signed July 7, 1994, filing a phony birth certificate saying he
was born April 7, 1978, a year earlier than the truth? Or did
Beltre or his family lie about his birthdate because they wanted
the $23,000 signing bonus?
</P>
<P>
   Could his true age have stayed concealed for five years without
his participation in the lie?
</P>
<P>
   What went through his mind last season when he read newspaper
stories, media guides, yearbooks and trading cards that gave his
age as 21 when in fact he was 20? Did he think, ``Oh, an
unfortunate misprint, which I must call to the intention of the
proper individual''? Did he think, ``Still foolin' 'em''? Did he
even know about the rules?
</P>
<P>
   And how long has agent Scott Boras known that Beltre's Dominican
birth certificate says he was born April 7, 1979? Did Boras sit on
the information until October to enhance Beltre's value on the
free-agent market?
</P>
<P>
   If the player and agent participated in the deception, then is
it right that they stand to profit, since Boras thinks he could get
$6-8 million a year for Beltre, who made $220,000 in 1999?
</P>
<P>
   You can try to blame the scandal on Beltre or blame the absence
of an international draft, or point out that confusion about the
true birthdates of Latin American ballplayers _ usually they lie to
make themselves !ital!younger!off! _ is hardly news.
</P>
<P>
   But that's missing the point. However it happened, it's a
Dodgers screwup, another in a series. What next? &QL;

FIGHTERS VOW TO SLUG AND NOT BE SLUGGISH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Both fighters, as well as those who run the sport,
say things will be different this time. Lennox Lewis and Evander
Holyfield meet again today at the Thomas &AMP; Mack Arena for one of
the biggest prizes in sports _ the undisputed heavyweight
championship _ and their place in history.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis says he'll be more aggressive than he was in their first
meeting, a controversial draw on March 13 in New York, when he
controlled the fight but fought too passively for his own good.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield says he'll be more like Holyfield, not the listless,
desperate fighter who looked all but shot.
</P>
<P>
   And Nevada officials have put everything in place to avoid the
disaster the first fight became _ read: terrible decision _ or
anything else that might sneak up and bite this reeling sport. The
state's best referee (Mitch Halpern) and most experienced judges
(Jerry Roth, Chuck Giampa and Bill Graham) will work the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of hope,'' said Marc Ratner, executive
director of the Nevada State Athletic Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Does Holyfield?
</P>
<P>
   Lewis (34-1-1, with 27 knockouts) dominated the fight in the
opinion of most. Using his immense height and reach advantages, he
kept Holyfield (36-3-1, 25 KOs) on the outside with his jab and
followed with what appeared to be more than enough power punches to
win easily.
</P>
<P>
   That judge Eugenia Williams stole the victory from him by
scoring it for his opponent couldn't mask reality: For the main
part, Holyfield was rendered helpless by a bigger, better fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget, Lewis (begin ital)did(end ital) outpunch Holyfield
348-130, according to computer statistics.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a flaw in Lewis' performance, it was his typical
lack of a killer instinct. It appeared he could've taken Holyfield
out had he pressed the issue but never took the chance.
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel Steward, Lewis' trainer, has been pushing him to become
more aggressive _ Steward even predicted a knockout within six
rounds _ and Lewis acknowledged that he plans to pick up the pace.
At the same time, don't expect a brawl: He said he won't fight
recklessly even though he's extremely determined to right March's
injustice and stake his claim as baddest man on earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to go in there thinking I've got to knock him
out,'' Lewis said. ``I think I'll be (begin ital)able(end ital) to
knock him out if I pick up the pressure a little bit more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in there once and it's definitely do-able.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield, who will be 37 on Friday, insists he was ill with
stomach and leg cramps going into the first fight.
</P>
<P>
   One of boxing's greatest warriors actually thought about
quitting after he failed to follow through on his prediction that
he'd knock out Lewis in the third round but, being the competitor
he is, persevered.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis dismissed such comments as excuses _ ``the cramps were due
to me punching him in the head,'' he said _ but Holyfield is
sticking with his story.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he's made some adjustments in training to cope with
Lewis' size advantage and tactics. He insists he'll find a way to
get inside the jab and, it appears, people are starting to believe
him. He remains about a 2-1 underdog but more and more experts are
predicting he'll win as fight time approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's his performances in rematches. He barely outpointed
Dwight Qawi but KO'd him in four rounds in their second
cruiserweight fight. He lost a close decision to Michael Moorer but
came back and knocked him out in eight rounds. He was outpointed by
Riddick Bowe but won a decision in a rematch few thought he could
take.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic thing is, you learn from your mistakes in life,'' he
said. ``I've made mistakes, but I've always been able to correct
them in another situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the opportunity to correct this and look forward to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   However, at what point does age become a factor?
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-seven is old for a fighter, especially one who has been
in as many wars as Holyfield. Some believe his performance against
Lewis was as much a result of age as anything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (begin ital)has(end ital) to become a factor at some
point,'' said one knowledgeable observer.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, after a series of debacles, boxing officials simply
hope Holyfield and Lewis earn the $15 million each will make and
that nothing goes wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Fans appear to be so disillusioned after the controversial first
fight, a boring Oscar De La Hoya-Felix Trinidad bout and a
no-contest when Mike Tyson met Orlin Norris, that they're staying
away from this one.
</P>
<P>
   The pay-per-view buy rate is not expected to exceed a measly
750,000, tickets remained available up to fight time and even
bettors aren't interested in putting down their money, according to
the casinos.
</P>
<P>
   An entertaining fight would certainly help ease the pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just hope,'' Ratner said, ``they come out and (begin
ital)fight(end ital), not box.''

USC LOOKING TO END SLIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PULLMAN, Wash. _ There's an old joke that you can see the end of
the world here in the Palouse, which is fitting because that's
right about where USC sees itself these days.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans (3-6, 1-5) are limping toward their season's
conclusion, with little left to play for after losing their fifth
straight game last week and being eliminated from bowl contention.
</P>
<P>
   A trip to play Washington State (2-7, 1-5) hardly sounds like an
elixir to the current ills permeating the program. But it might be
what the Trojans deserve as they try to stave off their first
six-game losing streak since 1991. Or worse, the possibility of
becoming the first USC team to lose seven straight games.
</P>
<P>
   If USC can't reverse its fortunes against the lowly Cougars,
perhaps it should set some records for futility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a three-game season and we've got to go do it,'' USC
coach Paul Hackett said. ``We can't worry about the other stuff.
When the season is over, we'll hash it out, but not now. Right now
we have to focus on Washington State.''
</P>
<P>
   That means issues like implementing the shotgun, or whether John
Fox should have been allowed to play linebacker, or whether Hackett
could have done things differently, will be put on hold.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans just want a victory, something they haven't
experienced since Oct. 2, when they defeated Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   The closest USC is getting to any apocalyptic activity is
placing all its hopes on the arm of Fox, who has gamely tried to
get his groove back after nearly two seasons away from playing
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what we need to do is focus on John Fox,'' Hackett
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox will make his second straight start today, but Hackett said
he will not be as likely to pull the senior out and insert junior
Mike Van Raaphorst, which he did early in the third quarter against
Arizona State. Fox's removal immediately became the latest Hackett
move to be second-guessed.
</P>
<P>
   Could Fox last all four quarters?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'll start and let's see how he's doing,'' Hackett
said. ``It could happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, Fox is the overwhelming choice of his teammates. Some
have even gone public with their opinions.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Van Raaphorst, you have to wait for the ball. He floats
them,'' freshman wide receiver Kareem Kelly said. ``John Fox is not
Carson Palmer, but he's the closest thing to him. John is athletic,
runs, scrambles out of the pocket and gives you a better
opportunity to make a play.
</P>
<P>
   ``John brings energy and intensity to the field and that is what
we need to overcome this barrier.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Fox is just trying to continue to acclimate
himself to game conditions after being written off by the coaching
staff last season and languishing at tight end and linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can get my completion rate up this week and
fine-tune some stuff,'' said Fox, who actually completed 15 of 24
passes for 148 yards before getting the hook. ``Obviously, I wasn't
happy. We didn't put up many points.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox might not be perfect, but the struggling Trojans don't have
any other choice today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to play at our best and I've been saying that for five
weeks and we have yet to do it,'' Hackett said.
</P>

CLARIDGE ABSOLVES USC COACHES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PULLMAN, Wash. _ USC offensive lineman Travis Claridge knows he
will not play in a bowl game for the third time his four-year
career, but he isn't willing to blame the transition period between
coaches John Robinson and Paul Hackett as a reason for the Trojans'
woes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough for us. We're kids trapped inside of men's
bodies. At 18, 19, we're not that mature yet,'' Claridge said.
``Someone was pulled away and someone was put in their place. But
there's coaching changes all the time. ``It has nothing to do with
what's on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coaches are not the ones dropping balls. Missing tackles.
Missing blocks. Making fumbles. Causing penalties. We're doing
that. Not them.''
</P>
<P>
   Claridge makes the 47th consecutive start of his career today
against Washington State and is on the verge of becoming the first
true freshman lineman to start every game of his career.
</P>
<P>
   That accomplishment means little to Claridge, however, compared
to stopping the Trojans' losing streak at five games. Other than
that, he's not looking at any other goals, including next week's
showdown with UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to end this five-game skid. Maybe we can beat UCLA,
but that game is not until next week,'' Claridge said. ``Before we
get to that game, we've got to win a game first. Just winning a
game. Not worrying about a streak. I never thought in a million
years I'd be sitting here with this many losses in my senior year
or that many losses in my USC career.''
</P>
<P>
   USC is 23-22 in Claridge's career.
</P>
<P>
   Who is this guy? Freshman tailback Deon Burnett of Claremont is
one of the few bright spots for the Cougars. His 761 yards rushing
is a school freshman record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure Paul Hackett and Bob Toledo are looking at their
assistant coaches and wondering why they weren't recruiting this
guy,'' Washington State coach Mike Price said. ``He's from right
down the road. He probably wouldn't have the chance he has right
now had we not lost two backs in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got thrown into the starting position and he's done a great
job, he's improved every game. He can run inside, outside and he's
a good pass receiver.''
</P>
<P>
   Banks commits: Fullback Jimmie Banks (6-foot-1, 240 pounds) of
Orange Coast College has orally committed to USC. He is the
Trojans' ninth commitment.
</P>
<P>
   On the subject of junior college players, Hackett has said he
would like to try to bring in at least two JC recruits to
participate in spring football, including a quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   No interceptions: Is practice performance an accurate predictor
of a game? USC's quarterbacks did not throw an interception in
practice this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans have had an interception returned for a touchdown in
each of the past three games.
</P>
<P>
   Chasing Keyshawn: Wide receiver R. Jay Soward needs 17
receptions in his final three games to surpass Keyshawn Johnson as
the No.2 all-time receiver in school history. Soward enters today's
game with 152 receptions. Johnnie Morton is No.1 with 201.
</P>
<P>
   Two QBs: USC isn't the only school with a mini-quarterback
controversy. Washington State backup Paul Mencke led the Cougars to
its only touchdown against Oregon. Senior Steve Birnbaum remains
the starter, but Mencke could see action. Mencke threw six
interceptions last season.

NEWS ANALYSIS: NEW CONCERNS ABOUT FIRST LADY'S CAMPAIGN
</HEADLINE>
   (ADDS 7th, 9th grafs with background, quote in 10th graf)

 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Among many Democrats Friday , the question was not
why Hillary Rodham Clinton had sat silently in Ramallah as the wife
of Yasser Arafat seemingly accused Israelis of poisoning
Palestinian women and children. The question was why Mrs. Clinton
had agreed to go to the West Bank in the first place _ and than why
it took her 12 hours to offer even a tentative response to Suha
Arafat's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, when Mrs. Clinton approved television advertisements
to promote her expected Senate campaign earlier this week, the
question was not over the wisdom of such an early expenditure of
campaign funds. It was instead over the fact that it was financed
with the same kind of unregulated, backdoor campaign contributions
that had clouded President Clinton's campaign in 1996, inviting
attacks by her likely opponent, New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, and critical comment by newspaper editorials.
</P>
<P>
   These two seemingly unrelated incidents might have been
separated by three days and 5,000 miles. But taken together, they
have stirred a new round of concern among many Democrats about the
state of Mrs. Clinton's exploratory campaign and the skills of this
first-time candidate. The two events have dispirited some of her
closest associates and emboldened Giuliani in what his advisers
describe as a deliberate attempt to establish an early dominance in
the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way this developed is troubling, and this needs to be
resolved,'' said one of Mrs. Clinton's advisers, who, like most of
her associates, did not want to be identified in discussing what
one described as the low point of her fledgling campaign.
``Everything she does will be viewed through the Senate lens.
There's no escaping it.''
</P>
<P>
   The events this week on the West Bank crystallized what a
growing number of Democrats has suspected: Mrs. Clinton's
underlying problem is her continuing effort to serve both as the
nation's first lady and as the likely Democratic candidate for U.S.
Senate in New York.
</P>
<P>
   She went to the Middle East at the invitation of Leah Rabin to
discuss the peace process at the center in Tel Aviv named after the
slain prime minister, Yitzak Rabin. In accepting the invitation,
Mrs. Clinton put aside the concerns of some advisers aware of the
perils that inevitably rise when New York and Israeli politics
meet.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of political creden- tials, Mrs. Clinton had
repeatedly visited the Middle East and had no need to return,
particularly now, giv- en the confluence of the start of her
campaign and a delicate moment in the peace negotiations.
 &UR;  &LR; The day she left, Mrs. Clinton pointedly described this as an
official trip, and said she did not want it viewed in the context
of a Senate race. She instructed her political staff to remain at
home, traveling instead with a contingent from the White House and
State Department.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Once she had framed her trip as an official White House visit,
she felt obligated, her aides said, to balance a stop at the
Western Wall with an appearance with Mrs. Arafat in the
Arab-controlled West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   But the difficulty in drawing such distinctions became extremely
clear this week, as television and news wires brought home her
Mideast events and her dismayed political aides closely followed
the unfolding trouble. ``If you were planning a campaign trip, this
is not the kind of campaign trip you would have planned,'' said
Howard Wolfson, the campaign press secretary, speaking from Mrs.
Clinton's headquarters in Manhattan. ``You wouldn't go to
Ramallah.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's aides said that had he found himself in a similar
position, the mayor might have stormed off, or denounced Mrs.
Arafat on the spot for making a statement that was sure to give
rise to protest among American Jews. Considering the fact that
Giuliani evicted Arafat from Lincoln Center in 1995, there seems
little reason to doubt that claim.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton and her aides offered a number of reasons for why
she, by contrast, said nothing about the remarks until she arrived
in Amman 12 hours later. She was, first off, concerned about taking
any step that might jeopardize the peace talks. The on-the-spot
translation she received was imprecise, said Marsha Berry, Mrs.
Clinton's White house press secretary, and she wanted to wait until
she got a formal written transcript before she actually offered a
response.
</P>
<P>
   And even the response exposed the dual, and dueling, roles that
she and her staffs are playing. Its delayed timing reflected the
cautious White House staff, which is often at odds with her more
aggressive, if clearly frustrated, campaign organization.
</P>
<P>
   And the sluggishness stirred concern among Democrats following
Mrs. Clinton's travels. ``If something like this happens, the first
thing you learn is fix it in the same news cycle,'' said one New
York Democratic strategist not associated with Mrs. Clinton's
campaign. ``Now you can't catch up. It's impossible to catch up.''
</P>
<P>
   A growing worry of some Democrats goes beyond her conflicting
roles to what they see as deficiencies in both her exploratory
campaign and her political skills. She has yet to hire anything
beyond a skeletal campaign staff, and what she has is scattered
between New York and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Ickes, her senior political adviser, serves as Mrs.
Clinton de facto campaign manager. But while Ickes is a native New
Yorker and well versed in city and state politics, he is based in
Washington, where he works as a private lobbyist. Until Mrs.
Clinton hires a campaign manager, there is no single force guarding
against missteps like this week's commercials and wayward trip.
</P>
<P>
   Her advisers insist that the campaign will gel once she formally
announces, and forges a separate political identity from the White
House. ``When she becomes a full candidate instead of being the
concept of the candidate, she's really going to be able to drive
her issues and her message in a way that she can't now,'' said the
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   But that quick palliative may not occur anytime soon. Before
Mrs. Clinton left for the Middle East, she and her advisers, after
some discussion, decided to push off her official announcement, yet
again, this time from January to February. Mrs. Clinton was said to
believe that January is still too early to begin officially
presenting herself as a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   From Amman Friday night, Ms. Berry, the first lady's White House
press secretary, said that Mrs. Clinton and her contingent had
monitored the tumble of events with an air of resignation. ``This
is a new process, really,'' Ms. Berry said. ``We're still working
out how to work together. We've done a pretty good job and we'll
continue to improve at it.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the days and weeks after Swissair Flight 111
plunged into the frigid waters off Nova Scotia, Michele Librett
said she turned to family and friends, neighbors and an airline
support team to make it through a period marked by shock and
denial, grinding physical pain and the grim sensation that life
couldn't possibly go on.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took care of all the things I was unable to focus on,''
explained Ms. Librett, whose husband of 14 years, Jeffrey, had been
among the 229 people killed in the crash on Sept. 2, 1998. ``I was
so devastated and so in shock, and I was not able to think about
all these little details.''
</P>
<P>
   A cadre of neighbors dropped by to take out the garbage or pick
up her two daughters at school. Another group took covered dishes
to her home in Wantagh, N.Y. Two volunteers provided by Delta
Airlines, through which Librett purchased his Swissair ticket,
ferried the family to a memorial service. And a Red Cross counselor
visited their home.
</P>
<P>
   But two months after the crash, Ms. Librett said, she still felt
isolated in her grief and desperate to connect with someone who
``understood the shock and full emotion that I was going through.''
</P>
<P>
   So she turned to Martha Rhein, a mother of four whose husband of
20 years, C. Kirk Rhein Jr., was one of 230 people who died when
TWA Flight 800 exploded off Long Island, N.Y., on July 17, 1996.
Ms. Rhein, 46, who lives in Darien, Conn., is among more than 50
people who have volunteered to serve as ``grief mentors'' through
AirCraft Casualty Emotional Support Services, a program that pairs
up people who have lost loved ones in air disasters.
</P>
<P>
   The organization, which is based in New York and referred to as
ACCESS, is one of several recent grass-roots efforts to help people
like Ms. Librett find support and solace from others who have
experienced the intense grief, shock and denial that come when an
airliner goes down.
</P>
<P>
   As family members deal with the devastation of EgyptAir Flight
990, which crashed off Nantucket, Mass., two weeks ago, the extreme
circumstances of such a calamity are once again fresh in the public
consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have experienced the aftermath of major plane crashes
know about exhaustive searches and recovery efforts, and that a
cause can remain elusive. They know that bodies are often not
recovered, and if they are, that open caskets are out of the
question. They know about the long, agonizing period of grief and
the seemingly insatiable public demand for private details. And
they agonize wondering whether loved ones suffered.
</P>
<P>
   The key for ACCESS volunteers is sharing the range of
experiences ``on the road of grief,'' as Ms. Rhein put it, while
stressing that life goes on.
</P>
<P>
   ACCESS was founded in 1996 by Heidi Snow, whose fiance, Michel
Brieistroff, a French hockey player, died in the crash of the
Paris-bound TWA Flight 800. The nonprofit group, run by Ms. Snow
out of a friend's New York City office, uses an Web site
(www.accesshelp.org) to reach mourners.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Snow said that ACCESS was born of her own experiences, when
she felt she had no one to turn to in the weeks after grieving TWA
families went home. ``When you go home is when it hits you that
they're gone and they're not coming back,'' she said. ``That's when
I found it so difficult to see that the support is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the first to seek help from the group was Lynn Ross, a
Manhattan garment merchandiser who lost the man she had lived with
for eight years, Joseph LaMotta, 49, in the Swissair crash.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ross said that after the disaster, she experienced a
hodgepodge of emotions and self-doubt. She could make herself go to
work, but she would often break down crying once there. She
couldn't listen to music. She couldn't eat. So she contacted
ACCESS, and was put in touch with Betty Capasso of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to speak to someone who's gone through it, in the
beginning, someone who can just sit and listen and say, `I know
what you're going through,''' said Ms. Ross, 48. ``You ask, Why am
I acting this way? Why am I coming home and I don't want to do
anything? I can't even write out a check. Is there something wrong
with me? And she would say, `That's exactly what happened to me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Capasso understood all too well. A decade before, her son
Greg, 21, had been killed in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over
Lockerbie, Scotland. She could also draw from her experience as a
trained counselor. ``When my son died, it was the only thing that
made sense to me,'' explained Mrs. Capasso, now director of the
Brooklyn Center for Families in Crisis, a mental health clinic.
``What I started to find out was that I started to see that I had
something to give others who experienced this kind of grief.''

CHARGES FLY IN RACE AT U.N. HUNGER AGENCY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ The Food and Agriculture Organization, a U.N. agency
headquartered in a marble and glass palace commissioned by
Mussolini, is not normally the subject of intense discussion
outside the building.
</P>
<P>
   That changed when an Argentine, Juan Carlos Vignaud, decided in
April to challenge the incumbent director general, Jacques Diouf of
Senegal, who had expected to run unopposed for a second six-year
term, following the custom at the agency.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, marked by public charges of waste and anonymous
petitions against Diouf, has suddenly raised the agency's profile.
</P>
<P>
   The election, which will take place by secret ballot on Saturday
in Rome, is drawing 175 delegates from member states. Vignaud said
last week that he believes he has the support of more than 90
members, including Britain. But Diouf, who hopes for the backing of
the United States, Canada, France and much of Africa, is seen as
the favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Established in 1945 to diagnose and alleviate the problems of
world hunger, the agency is a vast bureaucracy of 4,086 employees,
2,236 of whom are based in Rome _ whose renown has faded even as
its budget has grown. The World Food Program, a smaller and trimmer
U.N. agency which specializes in emergency work in places like
Kosovo, North Korea, and Eastern Timor, gets far more attention.
</P>
<P>
   To many, it was telling that when a tainted-food scandal
involving Coca-Cola erupted in Europe this summer, President
Jacques Chirac of France proposed the creation of a global food
safety agency, seemingly forgetting that food quality control is a
mandate of the FAO.
</P>
<P>
   Vignaud, Argentina's ambassador to Sweden, has traveled to 40
countries at his government's expense to lobby governments. In a
campaign manifesto, he complained that the agency's overhead budget
had increased to $754 million in 1999, from $652 million in 1993,
while spending on field operations tumbled to $444 million, from
$880 million. Diouf has not given interviews about the election,
but he disputed those figures and other charges in a 15-page
defense prepared by his office.
</P>
<P>
   Diouf disputed Vignaud's calculations on the main budget, saying
it had actually decreased to $650 million this year from $677
million in 1993. He conceded that spending in the field had
declined, but he blamed that on a cut in funding from the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Diouf also responded to anonymous letters sent to voting
delegates, which accuse the director general of arrogance,
excessive expense-account travel and misuse of perks. His life on
the road, Diouf said, ``is not a pleasure trip.'' He added, ``If I
were not to travel, those same people would criticize me for
staying in an air-conditioned office in an ivory tower in Rome.''
</P>
<P>
   Waste, high costs and abuse of privilege are perennial charges
lofted at many of its agencies, and that is why the United Nations
created the Office of Internal Oversight Services in 1994, to
monitor abuses.

FDA PLANS TO REQUIRE FOOD LABELS TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON TRANS
FATS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ADDS 9th graf to describe current system) 
(rk) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Faced with mounting evidence that a type of fat
often found in margarine and baked goods raises the risk of heart
disease, the Food and Drug Administration announced plans Friday to
require food manufacturers to include specific information about
these fats on nutrition labels.
</P>
<P>
   The regulation covering the fats, called trans fatty acids or
just trans fats, would be the first significant change in food
labels since the FDA began requiring them in 1993. Nutrition
experts say it is important because trans fats, which are liquid
fats that have been turned into solids, are even more unhealthy
than saturated fats. Yet consumers have no way of knowing which
products contain them.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point in time there is unanimity that trans fats are a
problem,'' said Dr. Walter Willett, chairman of the nutrition
department at the Harvard School of Public Health. ``We sometimes
refer to them as a stealth fat because you eat them and they are
not on the label.''
</P>
<P>
   The label changes will not take effect right away. The FDA
intends to publish the proposal in the Federal Register next
Wednesday, and the public will have 90 days after that to comment
on it. It could be as long as a year from now before a final rule
is published, and two years after that before consumers see any
changes, said Joseph A. Levitt, director of the agency's Center for
Food Safety and Applied Nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   Food industry representatives said they would not fight the
rule. But they are likely to raise objections to its details,
particularly a provision that would set limits on the health claims
manufacturers can make about products containing trans fatty acids.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rhona Appelbaum, chief scientist for the National Food
Processors Association, a trade group, called the rule premature.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have liked to see the science evolve further.'' she
said, adding, ``We are still looking at this proposed rule very
closely, making sure that it is truthful, useful and above all,
understandable for consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Trans fats are produced artificially, through a process called
partial hydrogenation that is used to convert liquid vegetable oils
into solid fats that are often used to make margarine, shortening,
baked goods and fast-food french fries. Trans fats are chemically
different from saturated fats, which also raise the risk of heart
disease, and have not been included in saturated fat content on the
nutrition label.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the amount of trans fats is reflected in the total
number of fat grams a product contains. For in- stance, if a
product contains 11 grams of total fat, but only 2 grams of
saturated fat and 7 grams of un- saturated fat, a consumer could
cal- culate the amount of trans fat: 2 grams. But that is not
stated explicit- ly under the current system.
 &UR;  &LR; Once in the body, trans fats behave like artery-clogging saturated
fats, increasing LDL, or ``bad'' cholesterol. In addition, Willett
said, trans fats lower HDL, or ''good'' cholesterol. He said the
evidence against trans fat had been building for a decade and had
become particularly strong in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement announcing the proposed rule, Dr. Jane E. Henney,
commissioner of food and drugs, called nutrition labels ``a
powerful tool for consumers,'' and added, ``By requiring this
information about trans fatty acids, this proposal should assist
individuals in their efforts to reduct their risk of coronary heart
disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed rule, products containing trans fats would
carry an asterisk or some other mark on the line for saturated
fats, directing consumers to a footnote about trans fats. The
footnote would be optional on foods that contain less than half a
gram of trans fat per serving.
</P>
<P>
   With respect to health claims, for instance, the rule would
require that foods advertised as low in saturated fat be virtually
free of saturated fat, containing no more than a half gram per
serving. Claims about low cholesterol would be permitted only on
food containing less than two grams or less of trans fat and
saturated fat combined.
</P>
<P>
   And there would be a new ``trans fat free'' claim, for foods
containing less than half a gram of trans fat and a half gram of
saturated fat per serving.
</P>
<P>
   Defining these health claims is just as important as providing
information on the nutrition labels, said Dr. Margo Wootan, a
senior scientist for the Center for Science in the Public Interest,
a consumer advocacy group in Washington. In 1994, the center
petitioned the food and drug agency to require disclosure of trans
fat content; Friday's announcement came in response to that
petition.
</P>
<P>
   ``A label of stick margarine boasts that it contains 70 percent
less saturated fat than butter,'' said Dr. Wootan. ``But the
additional three grams of trans fat hidden in each serving means it
doesn't do 70 percent less damage to your arteries.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Dr. Wootan and Willett, of Harvard, said they hoped the
proposal would spur food manufacturers to shy away from using trans
fats in their products. Margarine manufacturers have already begun
to make those changes, using new processing methods that eliminate
the fats, according to Richard Cristol, president of the National
Association of Margarine Manufacturers, a trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Cristol said manufacturers were anxious to post margarine's
trans fat content on nutrition labels, because they think consumers
will be surprised. He said 30 percent of margarines on the market
are made without trans fat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of feel we deserve a little bit of a pat on the
back,'' he said. ``We have made tremendous progress.''

MORE IMMIGRANTS ARE DEPORTED AS OFFICIALS' POWER INCREASES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Equipped with new powers to turn away immigrants at
the borders, and with more jail space available for those people
they arrest inside the country, immigration officials in New York
City have deported more than 4,000 people in the last year, an
increase of 12 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, nearly 177,000 people were deported or sent back to
their home countries for criminal or noncriminal offenses during
the 1999 fiscal year, an increase of 3 percent, according to a
report released yesterday by the Immigration and Naturalization
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Of those, 62,000 people had committed, at some point during
their residence in the United States, one of the crimes that are
grounds for deportation. The agency said that about half of those
deported had been convicted on drug charges. Most of the others had
been convicted of assault, burglary, and violating immigration
laws. Almost 115,000 people were deported or turned away because
they were in the country illegally or had tried to enter with false
documents.
</P>
<P>
   The higher numbers were likely to please those in Congress who
have accused the agency of doing too little to find and deport
aliens with criminal records and false documents. The immigration
service estimates that 500,000 immigrants are in the country
illegally, although it has been using the same estimated number for
more than three years.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates for immigrants said the increase seemed to justify
their fears about a 1996 law that gave the INS an array of new
enforcement tools, including the right to deport people quickly
upon their arrival at an airport or land border without allowing
them a lawyer or a judicial hearing.
</P>
<P>
   That process is called expedited removal. It is used to turn
away not only people with false documents, but also those who
request asylum when they arrive. The agency did not provide figures
for the New York region airports alone, but it said that more than
89,000 people at all the nation's borders had been the subjects of
expedited removal in the last year, an increase of 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is really frightening,'' said Elisa Massimino, director
of the Washington office of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights.
``This is an administration who opposed expedited removal and
unfortunately now embraced it to improve the deportation numbers.
We are afraid of what this portends for refugees seeking asylum
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials said that the increase in deportations was
the result in part of the success of their efforts to identify
criminals who are not citizens while they are serving their prison
sentences. Nearly 20,000 people were deported straight from state
and federal prisons in the last year, an increase of nearly 45
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In that same time period, the agency also received about $80
million in a special appropriation _ bringing its deportation
budget to $809 million _ to expand its detention beds to about
17,500 and bring its staff of enforcement officers up to 15,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greater our capacity to detain, the greater our capacity
to remove,'' said Russell A. Bergeron Jr., an agency spokesman.
``If you cannot detain, odds are you will not remove them.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the field offices that look for undocumented immigrants
generally will not initiate a raid on a workplace, for example, if
there is not enough space to detain people awaiting deportation.
</P>
<P>
   The jump in deportations in the New York district paralleled
increases at other major gateway cities. San Francisco, for
example, deported 23 percent more people and Houston 29 percent in
the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997, the agency has set annual targets for deporting
illegal and criminal aliens. Each year, it has surpassed its goal,
which for the 1999 fiscal year was 120,000.

U.S. EXTENDS TRADE TALKS IN BEIJING 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS 6th graf to note Barshefsky-Zhu meeting.) 
(mk) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ In a last-ditch effort to reach an agreement on
China's entry into the World Trade Organization, American
negotiators decided overnight Friday to stay here a fourth day for
at least one more meeting.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, the Americans, practicing high-stakes
brinkmanship, had said that the talks so far had been fruitless and
announced that they were heading home.
</P>
<P>
   But after an exchange of messages during the night, the two
sides agreed to meet again Saturday to make another try.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Chinese have balked at demands for the thorough
opening of domestic industries to foreign ownership, which the
United States insists is a condition for China's entry into the
global trade body.
</P>
<P>
   Early Saturday, Tom Tripp, the spokesman for the American
negotiating team, said, ``Although progress has been slow in the
talks so far, because of the importance of the issues, both sides
thought it would be useful to have an additional day of meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   During the night, Charlene Barshefsky, the U.S. trade
representative, was for the first time this week asked to meet with
Prime Minister Zhu Rongji. They met Saturday morning inside the
government's leadership compound, Zhongnanhai.
</P>
<P>
   In private, American officials expressed pessimism and
disappointment that, up to now, the Chinese had been unable to
match the market-opening concessions Zhu made in Washington last
April.
</P>
<P>
   One American official here said Saturday morning, ``There's been
very little progress at all toward anything that could be
considered a commercially satisfactory agreement in the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Clinton administration desperately wants to secure
China's entry into the trade body as a calming force in stormy
Chinese-American relations, it is under pressure from Congress and
American business interests to gain sweeping concessions.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese, while proceeding slowly toward a market economy,
fear the short-term social dislocations of opening industries to
outside competition and have pressed for more lenient terms of
entry.
</P>
<P>
   This week's talks, which follow more than a decade of fitful
negotiations and a near-agreement in April, have been widely seen
as make-or-break, and the administration is clearly anxious to
pursue all possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington on Friday, President Clinton said that differences
remained on a ``finite and limited number of issues'' and added,
``I have not given up.''
</P>
<P>
   Bringing China into the world organization soon has been a prime
goal of Clinton, and failure would be a setback for his strategy of
engagement with the world's most populous country.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese have been publicly silent about this week's
negotiations, and the Americans have not publicly described the
remaining areas of disagreement. One American diplomat said major
points of contention included the American demand that China allow
majority foreign ownership in the telecommunications and
financial-services industries.
</P>
<P>
   Other American officials said the negotiators had particularly
pressed China, without success, to open its securities industry to
outsiders. Garnering a foothold in China for Wall Street companies,
officials said, could broaden the political support for a deal even
if majority foreign ownership in telecommunications and certain
other sensitive sectors proved impossible.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a visit to Washington in April, Zhu agreed to open up most
industries to majority ownership by foreigners. But this week the
Chinese delegation, led by Foreign Trade Minister Shi Guangsheng,
has so far refused to match the April offer in important respects,
American officials said.
</P>
<P>
   China's backsliding may reflect not only Zhu's apparently
diminished power but a broader shift in the political atmosphere
here toward a more conservative and nationalistic stance. This
change gathered force during the Kosovo war last spring, when China
vehemently opposed the NATO bombing campaign, and it accelerated
after the bombing of China's Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, in
which three Chinese were killed.
</P>
<P>
   A failure to join the trade organization now would not mean that
China's gradual opening to outside competition, and its efforts to
overhaul hidebound state enterprises, would come to a stop,
economists here and abroad said.
</P>
<P>
   China and the United States had both hoped that an agreement
could be reached by Nov. 30, when discussions are to begin in
Seattle on a new round of global trade talks. China needs to
conclude bilateral accords with major partners before it can enter
the global body.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, administration officials privately said that an
agreement would be possible if China could match the terms it
offered in April.
</P>
<P>
   But in the intervening months, Chinese industrial and
bureaucratic interests began to lobby against such deep
concessions. Even military officers joined the fray, describing
control over the telecommunications sector, for example, as a
national security issue, said Joseph Fewsmith, a Chinese-politics
specialist at Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu, an impatient, straight-talking reformer who is popular
abroad and with ordinary Chinese, came under attack from
conservative politicians and ministers who want to preserve
national control of key industries.
</P>
<P>
   According to many reports, he no longer has control over the
trade talks or the overhaul of state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm convinced that Zhu Rongji remains prime minister in name
only,'' said Fewsmith, who recently visited China to examine trade
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu and his disciples hope that membership in the world
organization, and the resulting jolt of global competition, will
hasten the overhaul of a domestic economy still encrusted with
bloated state companies and monopolies.

TUIASOSOPO HAS McNOWN-LIKE QUALITIES 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ What concerns UCLA most about Washington quarterback
Marques Tuiasosopo is not his cannon arm or blazing speed or vast
experience or stellar pedigree. He has none of those attributes,
save the pedigree. (His father, Manu, played defensive line for the
Bruins in the 1970s.)
</P>
<P>
   Instead, what worries the Bruins most about Tuiasosopo is his
resemblance to an old friend. In instinct and toughness, in
leadership and savvy, he's the closest thing the Pac-10 has to Cade
McNown. And the last person UCLA's battered defense wants to face
is a McNown-alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing is (Tuiasosopo's) ability to make plays,''
Bruins coach Bob Toledo said, echoing McNown's greatest asset. ``He
gets away from the rush. He finds open guys. He plays hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best player in the conference.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuiasosopo's courageous performance two weeks ago against
Stanford (509 total yards despite a severely bruised behind) was
reminiscent of McNown against Oregon, when he vomited at midfield,
then led the Bruins to an overtime victory.
</P>
<P>
   Their similarities in style and productivity explain why
Tuiasosopo is heavily favored win Pac-10 Player of the Year honors
and why Washington is tantalizingly close to its first Rose Bowl
since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies' senior class is as small as UCLA's (12 members).
Their running backs and receivers are no better than seventh in the
league. Their defense is eighth in the conference. They have the
Pac-10's worst pass rush and they outscore opponents by three
points a game.
</P>
<P>
   In short, there's no tangible explanation for their success _
except they have the best player at the most important position.
Tuiasosopo is a running, passing get-out-of-jams-free card.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets us off the hook and all coaches will tell you that if
you've got somebody to do that, you're way ahead of the game,''
Huskies coach Rick Neuheisel said. ``Cade McNown did that for
several years at UCLA. Marques is doing that now for the Huskies.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins hoped he would do it for them, given the family
bloodlines. Naturally, Tuiasosopo was a huge UCLA fan growing up
the early '90s in Woodinville, Wash., which lies 30 minutes east of
Husky Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``In junior high, I'd get in fights with friends over the
UW-UCLA game, which was pretty crazy since that was when the
Huskies were so dominant,'' Tuiasosopo told the Tacoma News
Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   But proximity to home lured Tuiasosopo to Washington. (His
sister, Leslie, played volleyball for the Huskies.) He sat behind
Brock Huard for two years, then took command this season _ of the
team and the conference.
</P>
<P>
   To get win No. 4, the Bruins must stop Washington's No. 11.

DAVID GREEN WINS WINSTON CUP POLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOMESTEAD, Fla. _ David Green knows that ``the book'' on David
Green in NASCAR circles is pretty much the same old story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard it so many times: `He can qualify but he can't
race,''' Green said as the sun set on the Homestead-Miami Speedway
yesterday. ``So yeah, saying I'm `frustrated' is probably an
understatement.''
</P>
<P>
   A journeyman throughout his Winston Cup career, Green stole some
headlines for himself and team owner Tim Beverley of Texas by
winning the pole for tomorrow's inaugural Pennzoil 400. Green
toured the relatively flat 1.5-mile oval in 34.669 seconds at
155.759 mph to notch his first career Cup pole in his 72nd start.
</P>
<P>
   Green's timing could not have been better. In addition to
raising his stock in NASCAR's top series, Green also handed
Beverley some ammunition for his ongoing negotiations with primary
sponsor 10-10-345. The long-distance telephone carrier has not
decided if it will continue to sponsor Beverley's purple No. 45
Lucky Dog Pontiac Grand Prix after this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our performance, I think, will keep those phone calls
coming,'' said Green, an unlikely candidate to lead a sweep of the
first five qualifying positions by Pontiac drivers. John Andretti,
championship runner-up Bobby Labonte, Dave Blaney and Ward Burton
all challenged for the pole before Green clicked off his rather
shocking hot lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts a little bit,'' said Green, referring to criticism
that has dogged him since his championship days in NASCAR's Busch
Grand National Series. ``We had our best \RCup\S finish at Phoenix
\R12th\S last week, and the first thing I read in the paper is some
of the Chevrolet and Ford people saying basically that `anybody
could drive a Pontiac nowadays in Winston Cup.' I don't feel like
that's a fair statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``So to beat Bobby and John Andretti is pretty special.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte's five poles trail only Jeff Gordon's seven this season
in a Chevrolet. And Andretti won his first pole of 1999 on the
similarly flat Phoenix International Raceway last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'll wake up \Rtoday\S,'' Green said, ``and I'll hear the
same old story: `Well, Green's a good qualifier. \RBut\S he only
won one race the year \R1994\S he won the Busch championship. And
he's not aggressive enough.' And all that. I won 19 poles in the
Busch series but didn't win 19 races. This is good; this is
special. But my goal is to show them on Sunday that we can race as
good as we qualify.''
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup points leader Dale Jarrett will start 12th after a
wind-whipped lap at 153.833 mph in the No. 88 Quality Care
Service/Ford Credit Taurus. Jarrett, who has a 231-point lead over
Labonte, can win his first Cup championship by finishing eighth or
better in a race scheduled for 267 laps.
</P>
<P>
   This will be Green's eighth start with Tyler Jet Motorsports and
Beverley, who fired Rich Bickle after the Pepsi Southern 500 at
Darlington (S.C.) Raceway in early September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we put David in the car at New Hampshire, he's just
gotten better and better and better,'' Beverley said. ``Somebody
said, `Do you think this will get the people you're talking to's
attention?' I said, `If it doesn't, then I'm going to quit.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But we'll figure out sponsorship. We've got some people that
want to work with us. And we'll make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Hut Stricklin scored his first career Busch GN pole
during qualifications for today's hotwheels.com 300. Stricklin,
driver of the No. 38 Barbasol Ford, toured the track in 36.131
seconds/149.456 mph.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Anthony Ruiz was celebrating his 8th birthday at the
Cineplex Beverly Center, joining the hundreds of children and
parents taking in ``Pokemon: The First Movie'' on four screens at
the center, one of 3,000 theaters that presented the animated film
on Wednesday and haven't had a quiet moment since.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-minute feature earned $10.l million on its opening day, a
school day, the largest Wednesday opening of any animated film
ever, and the biggest Wednesday opening for any film in Warner
Bros. history. On Thursday, it made another $9 million. By the end
of the weekend, its earnings are expected to exceed $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby toyshops sported prominent Pokemon displays; kids
clutched their precious Pokemon figurines, some wore Pokemon
T-shirts. No doubt, some had Pokemon videogames in their knapsacks.
Ruiz struggled to explain what all the fuss was about. ``It has
these characters,'' he said. ``They come from a different world.
People collect them and they have these different battles.''
Finally, he gave up. ``It's just cool,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pokemon craze can seem impenetrable to those _ adults, for
instance _ who are not conversant with its intricate fantasy world.
Even those who are promoting the phenomenon, and reaping the
astonishing rewards, are a little stunned by how deftly it has
attached itself to the hearts of millions of American children,
especially boys between the ages of 5 and 12.
</P>
<P>
   But while luck certainly played a role, Pokemon is also the
result of a very calculated series of creative and marketing
decisions aimed at learning the lessons of previous toy crazes like
Beanie Babies, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Mighty Morphin
Power Rangers, and using those lessons to build something that will
not only resonate with children but survive longer than the 18
months to three years that these crazes normally last.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put a considerable amount of attention into that,'' said
Gail Tilden, vice president for product-acquisition development at
Nintendo and the queen of all things Pokemon, and responsible for
shepherding the Pokemon brand through its many American
manifestations.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tilden is responsible for making sure that all the Pokemon
products adhere to the basic story line behind the series, that
none of the products are marketed to preschoolers or toddlers
(because if babies play with it, older children will want nothing
to do with it), and that Pokemon characters are attached to
compatible toys (a water-related Pokemon on a water toy, for
instance). She also monitors the rolling out of new Pokemon
characters, which is done in a way intended to stimulate the
collecting side of the craze _ not so few characters that they are
too easily collected, nor so many that collecting them all, the
goal of all true Pokemoners, seems unrealizable. ``We are trying to
mirror the property very well, not just put the Pokemon theme on
anything,'' Ms. Tilden said.
</P>
<P>
   For those unacquainted with Pokemon, it is a series of products
that revolve around a fantasy world created by Japanese animators
and game creators in which there are two kinds of creatures, humans
and Pokemon. The latter are 151 animal-like creatures (three new
ones are introduced in the new film, bringing the total to 154),
each with its own personality and powers and the ability to
transform into yet other creatures. The 12-year-old hero of the
story, Ash, yearns to be a master Pokemon trainer, and to do so he
vows to capture all the Pokemons (''Gotta Catch `Em All'' is the
Pokemon tag line and the anthem of all Pokemon enthusiasts).
</P>
<P>
   Children can imitate Ash and try to capture Pokemon, as well,
either in the videogame or by buying their plastic figures or
trading cards. And there are dozens of related consumer items from
clothes to toothbrushes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very difficult for any franchise to come into prominence
in the kid world, to be forefront in their minds,'' said Gene Del
Vecchio, the author of ``Creating Ever Cool: A Marketer's Guide to
the Kid's Heart'' (Pelican, 1997) and the head of CoolWorks, a
consulting company that helps companies invent and build brands for
children. ``There are thousands and thousands of competitors for
that honored slot. Even more difficult is trying to keep within a
kid consciousness for more than the 18 months or three years these
things normally last. How do you create a mechanism whereby you can
reinvent yourself?''
</P>
<P>
   Many children's marketing experts said that the shrewd design of
the Pokemon empire _ its perfectly pitched emotional story line,
the way it stimulates social interaction, the sense of power and
belonging it gives children _ give it a good chance to avoid
craze-burnout. Others were not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really something amazing that has occurred,'' said
Steveanne Auerbach, who goes by the name Dr. Toy and reviews toys
and children's products from her Internet site, www.drtoy.com.
``But I expect Pokemon will have the normal life span of these
sorts of things. It's here until the next wave comes along.''
</P>
<P>
   While some may look at the Pokemon craze as a marvelous
marketing machine, some of those caught up in it are not as
generous in their assessments. Several schools around the country
have banned the Pokemon cards because administrators found the
frenzy over them too disrupting. Parents have complained of the
large sums of money required to satisfy a child's Pokemon habit,
and some of the children themselves have begun to resist the
brand's ubiquitousness.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, more than a dozen anti-Pokemon sites have
popped up in the last several months _ just a tiny fraction of the
pro-Pokemon sites and chat rooms on the Internet. One was started
by a 13-year-old, eighth-grade boy in Toronto whose Web name is
Evex but who refused to give his real name. ``At first, I sort of
liked Pokemon but then I thought about it and decided to create the
page,'' Evex said. ``I consider Pokemon to be some sort of scam to
take all your money, with all their marketing stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Pokemon _ which began life in the United States in September
1998 as a Nintendo videogame and quickly expanded into bean-bag
toys, action figures, comic books, T-shirts and a cartoon show _
looked as if it had reached fever pitch last spring with the
release of Pokemon collectible cards that became the currency of
choice on thousands of American playgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out that was just a warm-up.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of a new fall season of Pokemon cartoons on the
WB Network, which runs the program 11 times a week; the
staggeringly successful release of the Pokemon movie, and a
concurrent marketing tie-in at 8,000 Burger King restaurants has
succeeded in catapulting the Japanese-born phenomenon to new
heights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got home from taking five kids to the Pokemon movie and
to Burger King,'' said Lynn Rosenblum, president of Toy Power
Consulting. ``When you look at it from a marketing and a branding
perspective, it's brilliant. It covers television, it covers video,
it covers things on your computer, there's the cards, there's the
toys, there are art contests. It's really one of the products that
has done the best job of covering all those bases.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When Pokemon was initially rolled out in Japan, beginning with
the introduction of the videogame in 1996, it was a much slower
process. The first Pokemon movie did not open in Japan until the
summer of 1998, two years after the videogame debuted and the
second film (yes, there is already a second, and it is to open in
the United States next summer) opened in Japan just three months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time we were ready to import Pokemon into the United
States, all of these products were available to us,'' Ms. Tilden
said. Marketers thus could capitalize more quickly on hot moments
in the craze.
</P>
<P>
   What often happens, in cases of toy lines like Ninja Turtles,
for instance, is that by the time it becomes clear that the concept
has clicked with children, it is too late to get a movie in
production and into theaters before the craze has begun to cool.
Movies are expensive and take a long time to make, and crazes
sometimes disappear in a blink. With Pokemon, everything was ready
and could be launched whenever marketers deemed the time was right.
</P>
<P>
   So while it may look like luck that Warner Bros. has a Pokemon
movie coming out at just the moment when the fever is at its
height, it is anything but, said Brad Ball, president of domestic
theatrical marketing for Warner Bros. Pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We counseled very closely with our partners, using their
insights on how they saw the new season television episodes
impacting, and we decided that the new episodes would further raise
demand for Pokemon. So ... we decided to release the movie
following the launch of the new television season but still ahead
of the competition in a very competitive environment,'' Ball said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The toughest competition appears to be Disney's ``Toy Story 2,''
which is set for release on Nov. 24, giving Pokemon two weeks in
theaters before Buzz Lightyear returns. ``Then, we can turn the
corner into the new year and have our video division ready for a
spring release,'' Ball said.
</P>
<P>
   After that, probably in the fall of next year, there will be an
entirely new Pokemon series. The current story line, known for the
red-and-blue game cartridges, will be followed by a gold-and-silver
story line, Ms. Tilden said. It, too, will star Ash, but he will
embark on an entirely new adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the former Pokemon creatures will return, others will
have mutated and there will be new ones, too (Ms. Tilden won't say
how many, beyond ``dozens''). In the first story, the Pokemon
seemed to be of indeterminate gender. In the new one, the issue of
gender will be addressed, with some creatures having definite male
and female characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are doing is extending the fantasy,'' Ms. Tilden said.
``It's the same world, but a new story. You will be able to find
out if the one you have is a boy or a girl.''
</P>
<P>
   There are two things that a children's brand needs, Del Vecchio
said: It has to ``touch timeless emotional needs within the
child,'' and it needs a ``mechanism that would allow it to stay
fresh'' and not go the way of the Power Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Barbie did was nail the whole notion of achievement for
little girls,'' Del Vecchio said. ``Pokemon was constructed to
touch several timeless emotional needs. Part of its power comes
from the story line of good vanquishing evil, where the child
becomes part of the story and is empowered to capture his own
monsters, train them and have them fight for him. It also
stimulates the desire to collect them all, but it's competitive in
a way that helps inspire social interaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Pokemon has its own story line (as did Power Rangers and Ninja
Turtles), but it also taps into the notion of collecting that
sustained the Beanie Babies craze. While Power Rangers had the
story line without the collecting and Beanie Babies had the
collecting without the story line, Pokemon has both. All of this
augurs well for the future, Del Vecchio said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The principles they are applying indicate it will last longer
than the average kid franchise,'' he said. ``Whether it will last
30 years will depend on other factors, like how good they are going
to be as marketers and what other franchises may be introduced that
will do an even better job. You know, kids are fickle. They will
get tired of these kinds of properties and dash off to the next
one.''

HOLYFIELD, LEWIS BATTLE TONIGHT TO RESTORE BOXING'S RESPECTABILITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ He has picked himself off the canvas so many times.
We have counted him out. We've taken his belt, for what we were
certain was the final time.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone, therefore, is going to pick up boxing by its
well-chewed ears, if anyone with a set of trunks knows how to take
a punch and help lead the sport out of its current wanderings, it's
Evander Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even here, a towel's throw from the Las Vegas Strip, they're
having a hard time buying into tonight's Holyfield-Lewis II as
boxing's much-awaited elixir.
</P>
<P>
   After all, wasn't it the initial fight between Holyfield and
Lennox Lewis, staged last March 13, that opened boxing's seeping
wounds in the first place?
</P>
<P>
   Those were the 12 rounds, largely dominated by Lewis, that so
befuddled judges at ringside that they were unable to declare a
winner. That was the same fight at New York's Madison Square Garden
where none of the judges were licensed representatives of the state
athletic commission. It was the same night when one of the judges _
a city bookkeeper from New Jersey _ scoring the fight complained
that her view was distorted because photographers kept getting in
the way.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, let's see, Mike Tyson was in and out of jail, and
then returned to the ring _ yet didn't. The great new hope, Oscar
De La Hoya, froze in the headlights in what was supposed to be
boxing's ``fight of the decade.''
</P>
<P>
   And just last week, Bob Lee, the head of the International
Boxing Federation (IBF), was indicted on 32 counts, including
accepting bribes, to manipulate rankings to set up title fights.
</P>
<P>
   (I know _ slap forehead in utter disbelief here).
</P>
<P>
   The only man in town, it seems, who can look at the billboards
for Holyfield-Lewis II and not snicker _ ``Search for the Truth:
Unfinished Business'' _ is the man who created them, the eternally
shameless Don King.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a chance that it could be the kind of redemptive fight
that some people are calling it, but you cannot take such a long
string of disappointments and expect it to all be absolved in one
night,'' said longtime boxing analyst Bert Sugar.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been an ongoing thing for boxing, and a rolling stone
will gather no moss _ nor customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet King bellowed again yesterday that tonight's fight at the
Thomas &AMP; Mack Center will be a success.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are interested,'' King said, ``because of all the
negativity from the first fight. Troubled waters can be quieted
here.''
</P>
<P>
   King thereupon boldly predicted that the fight will generate 2
million pay-per-view sales (the March bout drew 1.2 million) and
that the 17,900-seat arena will be filled.
</P>
<P>
   You have to wonder. As a president _ not the current one _ once
said, you can't fool all of the people all of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are shelling out lots of money to watch these things,''
Sugar said, ``and there's a growing perception that the value
received is going down.''
</P>
<P>
   King is calling the live gate a sellout, but even that remains
in doubt. The big casinos traditionally buy large blocks of
title-fight tickets for their high-rolling best customers. But many
of those tickets have already been returned, and impromptu brokers
are selling fistfuls around the large hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, registration starts today for COMDEX, the fall
computer geekfest billed as the world's largest convention. Vegas'
expected wad of $100s, in other words, has been replaced by a
gathering of pocket protectors.
</P>
<P>
   It should still be an intriguing fight. Holyfield was woefully
unprepared and roundly outboxed eight months ago. He had predicted
a third-round knockout, but his spirits sagged as the evening in
New York went on.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield has done this before, of course, losing to the likes
of Riddick Bowe and Michael Moorer. He has a new plan for this
fight, he said this week, and he is better prepared, even training
in late evening to mimic the expected late starting time of
tonight's bout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to make everyone forget what happened,'' Holyfield
said.
</P>
<P>
   He meant the first fight, I guess. But boxing has never needed
him as much.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, the underappreciated challenger, has neither Holyfield's
resume nor his common man's charm. But he does have what would seem
to be an insurmountable edge _ a 6 1/2-inch advantage in reach over
the lighter, shorter, older Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   Together, in any case, the two will try to resolve boxing's
``unfinished business,'' as daunting as that may be.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be a tough and messy sell, with or without a pocket
protector.

RANGERS LOSE FREE-AGENT WING TO BRUINS   SETTING OFF WEIRD CHAIN OF
EVENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JASON DIAMOS   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   RYE, N.Y. _ Joe Murphy, the Rangers hardly knew you.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday morning, Murphy talked his way into a free-agent
tryout with the Rangers while the team was in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the 32-year-old right wing unexpectedly bolted to
Boston, agreeing to terms with the Bruins before allowing Neil
Smith, the Rangers' president, to even make a counteroffer.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a friendly parting of the ways. And judging by the
bizarre manner in which Murphy left the Rangers' practice complex
in Rye _ he argued with members of the front office and coaching
staff and accused Smith of throwing one of his skates into the
river (Murphy was not around long enough to know that the body of
water in Rye is the Long Island Sound) _ the Rangers felt a little
jilted.
</P>
<P>
   They also seemed to feel they would be better off without him.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Smith later said that he wished he had thought of
throwing Murphy's skate into the water. ``This should be in
Ripley's Believe It or Not,'' Smith said, referring to the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy took off for Boston as the Bruins were preparing to leave
for New York, where they will play the Rangers on Saturday night.
It should be even more interesting in Boston on Thursday, when the
Rangers and Bruins meet again.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest chapter of the feud between Smith and Harry
Sinden, the Bruins' president, the Bruins told the NHL that Sinden
had no idea that Murphy was working out with the Rangers. But news
of Murphy's tryout was reported last Monday, in both New York and
in Chicago, where Murphy lives.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, meanwhile, insisted Friday that Sinden had phoned
Murphy's father earlier this week to see if Murphy might be
interested in signing with Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy did, for a $900,000 base salary with incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the offer was a significant cut in salary from the
$3.8 million Murphy earned while collecting 25 goals and 23 assists
for the San Jose Sharks last season, he reached a deal with Sinden,
who often criticizes Smith and his free-spending ways.
</P>
<P>
   When Murphy left Chicago to train with the Rangers, he thought
he had a deal with Smith for an $800,000 base salary with
incentives.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith said Friday that he was going to offer Murphy only a
$500,000 base. In other words, the Bruins outbid the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy was incensed that he did not have an agreement with
Smith. He accused Smith on Friday of paying him only lip service
and he argued that he had to sign with Boston because he might have
got hurt skating with the Rangers and been out of luck with no
contract in place.
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday afternoon, Murphy, who was an unrestricted free
agent, phoned John Muckler, the Rangers' coach and his former coach
in Edmonton, in Chicago to ask for a tryout. On Sunday, in two
meetings with Smith, Murphy, according to the Rangers, all but
begged for a chance to be on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beg?'' Smith said of Murphy, who had not fielded any contract
offers before the Rangers allowed him to accompany them to New York
on Sunday night. ``I was going to throw him a Milk Bone. Instead, I
gave him a tryout.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy skated with a handful of Rangers at Monday's optional
workout. He participated in Tuesday's full practice and Wednesday's
morning skate.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy did not make the trip to Washington on Thursday for the
Rangers' 5-4 overtime victory.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he phoned Smith in Washington twice on Smith's cell
phone during the game, then once more early Friday morning to
inform Smith of a noon deadline the Bruins had imposed on Murphy to
decide.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Murphy arranged an 11:15 a.m. meeting in Rye. But by
the time Smith arrived, Murphy had already informed the Rangers
that he had agreed to terms with the Bruins, his sixth NHL team.
</P>
<P>
   That did not go over well with the Ranger players, who were not
high on the idea of Murphy's signing with them in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   They also were not fond of Murphy's attitude when he arrived at
the Playland ice rink to retrieve his gear.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy complained to everyone within earshot of a missing skate
and a missing set of pads (he later found that his sticks had been
sawed halfway through).
</P>
<P>
   And then, with Smith and Muckler in an office 20 feet away,
Murphy tried to plead his case with the Rangers' assistant general
manager, Don Maloney, and the assistant coaches Charlie Huddy and
Keith Acton, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Tim Taylor, who scored the winning goal in overtime in
Washington, told Murphy to take a hike after Murphy had walked into
the trainer's room to question the trainer Jim Ramsay about his
missing gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the toughest I've ever seen him,'' Taylor later said,
referring to the perception that Murphy _ an excellent skater and
accomplished scorer _ is also a little bit soft.
</P>
<P>
   Capping the bizarre week were Murphy's parting words: he asked
Huddy to tell Muckler it was nothing personal, that he ``would go
to the wall'' for his old coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a strange world,'' Muckler said. &QL;

GLOBAL TRADE HARMONY? WTO NATIONS CAN'T EVEN AGREE ON AGENDA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ The World Trade Organization was meant to usher in a
glorious new era of global trade harmony, but in the five years
since its creation, the trade body increasingly has become more of
an international agreement to disagree. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That has been amply illustrated in the current gridlock on the
agenda for negotiations at the rapidly approaching summit meeting
of the organization, which makes the rules of global commerce and
negotiates disputes among trading partners.
</P>
<P>
   Despite more than two months of effort, countries have made
little progress on figuring out a framework for negotiation. The
ministers, due to meet in two weeks in Seattle, could be facing a
big wish list from member countries that will be difficult, if not
impossible, to tackle in the four-day meeting designed to help
dismantle resilient barriers to international trade.
</P>
<P>
   The seeds of the divisiveness were sown earlier this year with
the bitter contest to select the first non-European head of the
trade group. Emerging-market economies, which comprise most of the
trade group's 135 members _ Estonia joined Friday _ flexed their
numerical muscle and stuck to demands for a developing country
choice.
</P>
<P>
   The fissures that appeared during the selection fight continue
to trouble the trade organization. In the run-up to Seattle,
countries are dodging compromise and instead setting out their
positions and refusing to budge to a degree that has imperiled a
new round of global trade talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a meeting in Seattle, but I am seriously worried
that there might not be a trade round,'' one trade envoy said.
``The chances are getting slimmer every day,'' agreed Japan's trade
diplomat, Yoichi Suzuki.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators are meeting days and some nights to thrash out an
agenda, which right now is a rambling 32-page document. Despite
high-level efforts two weeks ago in Lausanne, Switzerland, to
kick-start talks, not much has happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, we really haven't agreed on anything,'' one European
envoy said. ``Even on the motherhood paragraphs dealing with
developing countries and technical cooperation, there are two or
three points of divergence.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite two public warnings by Mike Moore, the director general
of the organization, that the impasse threatens to torpedo the
coming talks, countries continue ``to lay out their positions and
stick to them,'' according to one participant in the private
negotiation meetings at the organization's Geneva headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to work out what the playing field will be,''
said Australia's trade envoy, Geoffrey Raby. ``But this is an
extremely complex exercise that involves real national interests
so, of course, countries want to try to tilt the playing field in
their favor.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore has been convening small groups in his Green Room, a
conference room near his office, in attempts to negotiate
compromises. This week, some movement was apparently achieved in
the thorniest area _ agriculture. Although the topic is part of the
built-in agenda, meaning it has to be negotiated, delegates are
laboring to figure just what the negotiations will encompass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The European Union and Japan, which have strong farming sectors,
are battling the United States, Australia and other agriculture
exporting countries over the issue. The exporters want agricultural
goods to be treated just like any other goods, with subsidies and
other protections eliminated. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, several large farming groups said in Geneva
that they opposed giving in to exporting countries on the issue.
Australia's Trade Minister, Mark Vaile, accused the European Union
and its allies of thwarting preparations for Seattle by refusing to
give any concessions on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago, a new two-page text on agriculture emerged
informally from Green Room discussions. It dropped the reference to
multifunctionality _ allowing reasons such as farming's role in
maintaining rural life _ to be used to justify agricultural
support. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Japan, however, does not agree. ``The issue is too politically
sensitive to be decided here,'' Suzuki said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to open to the public the trade organization's mostly
closed proceedings also seem to have fallen flat, with most
countries sticking to the idea that they belong to a
government-to-government organization. Underlining this
stubbornness is a failed attempt by Canada to introduce a new
preamble to the agenda that explains in everyday English the
mission and goals of the trade body. Canada's delegation had hoped
such an approach would deflect criticism from labor and
environmental organizations, which have protested that the trade
group has enormous power and little accountability.
</P>
<P>
   With a short time left before hundreds of officials gather,
Moore has indicated he plans to come up with two more drafts in the
hope of reducing the document to a manageable negotiating size.
However, it is unclear that any new draft would look much different
from the current version _ which is the second draft _ although
basic editing would slim it down. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The key, diplomats agreed, is the political will to get it done.
No one country is to blame, most said, but the enormous differences
between the United States and the European Union have impeded
progress. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The accepted wisdom is that despite foot-dragging on
agriculture, the Europeans want a wide-ranging set of trade talks
to open markets and bolster the Continent's economies. The Clinton
administration, enjoying a booming economy, wants a more limited
agenda, especially on the verge of an election year when there is
no point in antagonizing voting constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no talk of boycotting Seattle, but there is talk of
putting off the round for a couple of years,'' a European
negotiator said. ``But that would be dangerous indeed because a lot
of momentum would go out of the trade liberalization process.''

TEEN-AGER WHO KILLED BOY DEFENDS MOLESTER AS GOOD `ROLE MODEL' 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By LAURA MANSNERUS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREEHOLD, N.J. _ Samuel Manzie, a teen-ager serving a 70-year
sentence for the murder of an 11-year-old boy, appeared in court
Friday to defend the pedophile who pleaded guilty to sexually
molesting him before he committed the crime.
</P>
<P>
   At the sentencing of Stephen P. Simmons, Manzie, now 17, said
Simmons had been a ``positive male role model.'' Manzie said he had
only cooperated in the investigation of his former lover because
the police hounded him and his psychiatrist told him he would be
arrested if he did not.
</P>
<P>
   Manzie's parents had traced their son's volatile and sometimes
violent behavior to his affair with Simmons. The relationship
between the two has been an integral part of a drama that has
played out in lurid detail since Sept. 27, 1997, when Manzie
sexually assaulted and strangled Eddie Werner, 11, who came to his
door selling candy and gift wrap for a school fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the appeal for leniency for Simmons, 45, charged with
criminal sexual contact and endangering the welfare of a child,
Judge Michael D. Farren of state Superior Court sentenced him to
the maximum term, five years. Simmons, who has served more than two
years, will be eligible for parole in four months.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons and Manzie saw each other Friday for the first time in
three years, though they had exchanged a few letters since Simmons'
trial in July. Farren dismissed sexual assault charges then, when
the teen-ager refused to testify against Simmons. As they were
brought into court, manacled and wearing prison khakis, the two
acknowledged each other with slight nods and sat impassively as
each gave his statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to shed some light on my relationship with Mr.
Simmons,'' Manzie said softly. ``It was a good one. Some say it
must have been a manipulative relationship, but how can they say so
if they weren't there?
</P>
<P>
   ``Please keep in mind,'' he told Farren, ``that he never forced
me to do more than I wanted to, and please keep in mind that I
never regretted the relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   The case centered on several encounters in August and September
of 1996, when Simmons, who lived on Long Island, N.Y., met the boy
near his home in Jackson Township, N.J. The two had met on an
Internet chat room for gay men and teen-agers; Manzie was 14, and
Simmons, who had two convictions for sexual activities involving
minors, was 42.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, however, Manzie insisted that by the summer of 1997 the
relationship was ``a fond memory.'' He said investigators from the
Monmouth County Prosecutor's Office, who were notified by
supervisors in the psychiatric day program that Manzie had just
begun, bullied him and took him out of the clinic against his
wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Manzie rebelled shortly afterward, smashing recording equipment
that the prosecutor's office had attached to his telephone for
taping conversations with Simmons. He also alerted Simmons. Later
that week, Manzie killed Eddie Werner.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement Friday, Simmons said he shared the blame with
many others who had dealings with Manzie _ prosecutors, the police,
psychiatrists and the family court judge who refused to hospitalize
the teen-ager. Referring to the slaying of Eddie Werner, Simmons
said, ``I will go through the rest of my life _ it doesn't matter
whether you let me go today or a year down the line _ with this on
my conscience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not an evil person,'' Simmons said, insisting that he
never meant to harm Manzie. ``Is it so hard to believe I actually
care about him?''
</P>
<P>
   Manzie's parents, Nicholas and Dolores Manzie, dismissed
Simmons' statement as manipulative and insincere. ``He said he's
not an evil person,'' Nicholas Manzie said. ``He had sex with a
14-year-old boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Manzie, when asked whether she could forgive Simmons, said:
``When I look at Mr. Simmons I see a lonely and sad man who has to
have relationships with children to fulfill his needs. I just don't
understand why he wouldn't want to do something for himself and get
the right help. His life has led him down a lonely street.''
</P>
<P>
   The Manzies were accompanied in court by Edward G. Werner,
Eddie's father.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor, Marc Fliedner, said Manzie's defense of Simmons
was not unexpected, but Fliedner warned the judge that ``the young
person who's going to speak to you is still a teen-ager.'' Simmons,
he said, had ``sealed Sam Manzie into a dark world.''
</P>
<P>
   After the sentencing, Alton Kenney, the first assistant
prosecutor, acknowledged that in the investigation, ``what was not
clear was the emotional commitment that Manzie had, and still has,
to Simmons.'' When asked about Manzie's allegations of misconduct
by investigators, Kenney said: ``Sam Manzie is serving 70 years for
a horrible, horrible act. It's clear Sam Manzie is looking for
someone else to blame, some other contributor.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview from the Monmouth County Jail Friday afternoon,
Simmons said, ``I'm very proud of the way Sam handled himself.''

JUDGE FINDS AIDS GROUP A VICTIM OF CITY RETALIATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In another First Amendment defeat for the Giuliani
administration, a federal judge in Manhattan ruled Friday that city
officials had improperly retaliated against an AIDS service
organization that had been critical of the mayor by moving to make
it ineligible for millions of dollars in federal money.
</P>
<P>
   The group, called Housing Works, has been a relentless opponent
of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's policies on AIDS, using guerrilla
protest tactics like blocking rush-hour traffic on bridges and
tunnels, interrupting the news conferences of city officials and
conducting sit-ins in city offices.
</P>
<P>
   The group operates two homes _ in Lower Manhattan and in the
East New York section of Brooklyn _ for homeless people with AIDS,
mental illness or drug addiction. The homes are supported through
federal grants, which are distributed by the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development to nonprofit groups through a ranking
system developed by the city. The agency has allocated $54 million
this year for such programs in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Housing Works said in a lawsuit in August that the Giuliani
administration had initially given it a favorable rating, making it
likely to qualify for a share of the federal money. But the suit
says top city officials, upset with the group's antagonistic stance
toward the mayor, downgraded its score, effectively blocking it
from obtaining $2.4 million to cover three more years of operating
expenses for the two residences.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, U.S. District Judge Allen G. Schwartz ruled that Housing
Works had established a pattern of antagonism by city officials and
had shown that they had acted with ``retaliatory intent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The court acknowledges that any mayoral administration might
reasonably resent activities such as those engaged in,'' Schwartz
said, ``particularly the militant kind seemingly favored by
plaintiff.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that Housing Works' ``right to continue to express that
criticism, however, is protected by the First Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision comes less than two weeks after a federal judge in
Brooklyn found that Mayor Giuliani had violated the First Amendment
by withholding payments to the Brooklyn Museum of Art over an
exhibition that the mayor deemed to be offensive.
</P>
<P>
   The city's corporation counsel, Michael D. Hess, said last night
that the city would appeal. ``We're disappointed in the outcome,''
Hess said, adding that the city denies all allegations of
retaliation in the suit.

CHRISTIE'S RULES OUT JOINING MASS-MARKET WEB VENTURES
</HEADLINE>
   (lh) 
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Christie's said Friday that it had decided against
joining forces with an online giant like eBay or Walt Disney Co.'s
Go.com to offer its auctions online and that it had merged its
six-month-old Internet unit into its marketing department.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's archrival, Sotheby's, announced an alliance with
Amazon.com five months ago, but after months of discussions,
Christie's officials said they had concluded that a link with a
giant online retailer risked diluting the Christie's brand name.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the officials said, Christie's will update
Christies.com, its Web site, so that over time it will be able to
offer its clients online bidding for all its auctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a decision to protect the integrity of our brand
name,'' said Edward Dolman, Christie's managing director in
America, when asked why the company chose not to link up with ebay
or Go.com. ``We made the decision not to go after high-volume,
low-value merchandise with a separate team of business-getters
because it didn't make commercial sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Christie's has decided to concentrate its energies on the high
end of the business rather than going after the mass market as the
Sotheby's-Amazon.com alliance has done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would potentially take us in the wrong direction,'' Dolman
said. ``We seek greater efficiency and market share at the top end
of the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Dolman added that he believed that the company's change of focus
would better protect the core of Christie's business, selling
multimillion-dollar fine and decorative arts. ``It will make us
increasingly more competitive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's plans could not be more different from Sotheby's, an
unusual situation for two companies that for more than 100 years
have slavishly copied each other's strategies.
</P>
<P>
   While Christie's sees the online business as an extension of its
existing auction business, Sotheby's $25 million investment in the
online business is intended to broaden its client base by offering
millions of Internet users an enormous sampling of merchandise,
from low-end poster art to jewelry and eventually even fine art.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's has put together a team of more than 100 people to
work on its Internet business, which is scheduled to start sometime
before the end of the year. It has also signed up 4,600 dealers who
have agreed to sell exclusively through Sotheby's.com.
</P>
<P>
   Its link with Amazon means Sotheby's will be starting two Web
sites before the end of the year: Sothebys.Amazon.com for
lower-priced merchandise and Sothebys.com for more traditional
auction fare. Both will offer goods vetted either by the dealers
selling online or by experts at the auction house.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's will not have to worry about vetting merchandise for
the Internet since everything it auctions has already been
authenticated by its own experts.
</P>
<P>
   Dolman declined to say just how much money Christie's planned to
invest in upgrading its Web site. But over time, he said, the firm
will not only have the capability to hold online auctions, but it
will also be able to offer multimedia viewing capabilities for
every item offered for sale, e-mail chat rooms with specialists,
and virtual reality tours of its exhibitions. To do this, Dolman
said, Christie's expects to spend tens of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's has already begun to test online auctions. In June,
it used the Internet to sell 100 guitars that belonged to Eric
Clapton, and last month, it held a live Webcast of a sale of
Marilyn Monroe's property.
