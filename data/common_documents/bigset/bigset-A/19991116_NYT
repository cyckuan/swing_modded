TOLEDO: THE PRESSURE IS ON THEM, NOT US
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Perhaps it was a calculated move to calm his young
team. More likely, he was speaking with typical bluntness.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, UCLA coach Bob Toledo fired the first salvo of
rivalry week when asked about the impact of the Bruins' eight-game
winning streak over USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a lot more pressure on them than us,'' Toledo
said Monday afternoon. ``They've got to stop the streak. We've got
the streak. There's so much pressure on, `Stop the streak,' `Stop
the streak.' ''
</P>
<P>
   However, given several chances to extol the streak or denigrate
USC, the Bruins declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like talking about the streak, because I don't want it
to change when I'm around,'' cornerback Ryan Roques said. ``I just
leave it be and try to add one more year by year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's motivation for both teams.''
</P>
<P>
   While there's pressure on USC to end the streak, there's
considerable pressure on UCLA to preserve it.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The pressure) has been there since the streak hit three or
four,'' defensive captain Pete Holland said. ``No one wants to be
the class that loses to USC.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Show of support: Toledo defended his counterpart, USC coach
Paul Hackett, who has been criticized for the Trojans' subpar
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very unfair,'' Toledo said. ``He's only been
there two years and he's trying to get the program going. I don't
know all his problems, but being a coach, you sympathize with those
things.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Bad reaction: The Pac-10 was not happy with ABC's decision to
show the UCLA-USC game Saturday instead of Cal-Stanford,
Oregon-Oregon State or Washington-Washington State _ games that
involve Rose Bowl contenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an embarrassment,'' Cal athletic director John Kasser
told the Oakland Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   ABC told the Pac-10 office that it was strictly a business
decision: Its important Los Angeles affiliate, KABC, needed the
Bruins and Trojans to boost ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the standpoint of promoting the Rose Bowl, obviously, we
disagree with the decision,'' Pac-10 assistant commissioner Duane
Lindberg said. ``They told us it was absolutely a business
decision. This year, because USC and UCLA have been down, (KABC)
hasn't had as many exposures with those teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unanimous across the board that the conference wasn't
happy and the members weren't happy, and we all voiced that.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Development of the week: The broken collarbones that claimed
UCLA's Cory Paus and USC's Carson Palmer have created an intriguing
quarterback matchup: USC's John Fox was a linebacker when the
season started, and UCLA's Ryan McCann was fourth string.
</P>
<P>
   __ Recruiting update: Sacramento tailback Albert Hollis visited
campus last weekend and attended the Washington game. One of the
nation's most-coveted players, Hollis is wavering on his summer
commitment to UCLA. He has visited Georgia and plans to see Notre
Dame, Nebraska and Texas next month.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if UCLA remained the leader, Hollis paused, then shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I guess,'' he said.

MANNESMANN STEADFAST IN FIGHT AGAINST VODAFONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (With VODAFONE-MANNESMANN) 
(mk) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ As chairman of Mannesmann AG, Klaus Esser
is hardly a stranger to take-no-prisoners pragmatism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find new things, accentuate our strengths and pull
ourselves out of weak areas,'' he remarked in a recent interview
with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
</P>
<P>
   Few executives have applied that bromide with more gusto than
Esser. As chief financial officer and more recently as chairman,
Esser sold scores of Mannesmann's old industrial businesses while
investing tens of billions of marks in the telecommunications
industry.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 10 years, Mannesmann has been transformed from a
producer of industrial pipes into the closest thing yet to a
pan-European telecommunications company.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann's D2 mobile telephone network is the biggest in
Germany, with slightly more customers than Deutsche Telekom AG. It
also controls the second-biggest cellular network in Italy and is
in the process of swallowing Orange PLC of Britain for $33 billion.
</P>
<P>
   On top of all that, Mannesmann is investing billions in
hard-wired networks in Germany and across Europe. The goal: to be a
full-service provider across Europe, from mobile telephone service
to Internet and high-speed data over fiber optic networks.
</P>
<P>
   So far, it has been a big success. Mannesmann's stock price has
quadrupled in the last three years, and analysts estimate that 90
percent of that value reflects its telecommunications businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Esser faces his biggest challenge yet: the possibility of a
hostile takeover of historic scale and audacity by Vodafone PLC of
Britain. The deal could be worth as much as $130.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Esser is determined to fight a Vodafone takeover, arguing that
the British company would bring nothing to Mannesmann shareholders
and that the two companies' strategies are fundamentally
incompatible.
</P>
<P>
   The hostile bid has also shocked at least some German industrial
leaders. Hans-Peter Stihl, president of the German Association of
Chambers of Industry and Commerce, said Monday that the government
ought to prohibit takeovers aimed at breaking up successful
companies against their will.
</P>
<P>
   But industry analysts say Vodafone has a chance of emerging
victorious, especially if it substantially improves its offer. And
even if it does not win, they say, Mannesmann could nevertheless
fall to other suitors like British Telecommunications or even an
American company like Bell Atlantic Corp. or SBC Communications.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest obstacle is that any takeover needs to win 75
percent of shareholders' votes, which means that a group with more
than 25 percent of the votes has a veto.
</P>
<P>
   One of Vodafone's big problems is that its offer is entirely in
stock, and the value of any potential offer declines if its share
price weakens.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann has some defense options. On Monday it sought to at
least disrupt any takeover by suing to disqualify the Goldman Sachs
Group, Vodafone's corporate adviser, on grounds that Goldman had a
conflict of interest. Mannesmann will also seek to persuade
investors that Vodafone's all-stock offer is inherently dubious and
that taking over Mannesmann would merely dilute Vodafone's stock.
</P>
<P>
   It can try to find a ``white knight,'' a company that would
acquire enough shares to block an unfriendly takeover. Esser has
thus far held talks with several companies, including BT and Bell
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   A more likely defense, according to some analysts, would be to
line up a core group of friendly investors. Mannesmann could agree
to sell some of its industrial units to companies that in turn
increase their stakes in Mannesmann and vote against Vodafone's
offer.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann can also try to invoke rules that prohibit any
shareholder from voting more than 5 percent of the stock. But those
rules are scheduled to expire next year.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann executives have repeatedly insisted that they are not
interested in white knights and that their top priority is
preserving the company's independence.
</P>
<P>
   The company's executives argue that Vodafone would add nothing
to their competitive position. Vodafone acquired AirTouch
Communications of San Francisco earlier this year, but it owns only
a minority stake in AirTouch's American properties as a result of a
deal it reached with Bell Atlantic Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann executives said they had little interest in the
American market and even less in minority stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Mannesmann executives argue that Vodafone would
disrupt their strategy of providing a full range of wireless,
conventional voice and Internet services. Vodafone has thus far
focused entirely on mobile phones, while the Mannesmann Arcor unit
is Germany's second-largest provider of fixed-line services.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, Mannesmann has already adopted a variant of the
``poison pill'' defense by purchasing Orange PLC for about $33
billion. Analysts say Mannesmann paid a huge premium for Orange,
and unhappy investors pushed down Mannesmann shares after Esser
announced the deal last month.
</P>
<P>
   Because Vodafone controls Britain's second-largest cellular
network, it would be required to sell Orange if it took over
Mannesmann. Given the high price Mannesmann paid and that Vodafone
would be a forced seller, analysts estimate that it might well have
to sell Orange for 10 or 15 percent less than Mannesmann paid.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone is expected to offer more than 200 euros a share.

JOHN PAUL STAPP, 89, `FASTEST MAN ON EARTH' 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS to insert day of death in 1st graf.) 
(lb) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Col. John Paul Stapp, an Air Force medical researcher who rode a
rocket-powered sled at a speed faster than a .45-caliber bullet in
an experiment to test the limits of human endurance, died on
Saturday at his home in Alamogordo, N.M. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   Stapp was known as the ``fastest man on earth'' for his 1954
ride, though the speed has since been surpassed, and it was never
accepted by auto racing officials as an official land speed record.
The speed was impressive, though. Stapp accelerated in five seconds
from a standstill to 632 mph. The sled then decelerated to a dead
stop in 1.4 seconds, subjecting Stapp to pressures 40 times the
pull of gravity.
</P>
<P>
   He became an immediate celebrity. The New York Herald Tribune
called him ``a gentleman who can stop on a dime and give you 10
cents change.''
</P>
<P>
   He won what will perhaps be even more lasting fame in a test
five years earlier, when he suffered injuries owing to a mistake by
a Capt. Murphy. The result: Murphy's Law.
</P>
<P>
   His 1954 experiment has been compared with being in an
automobile crashing into a wall at 50 mph with the shock of the
impact lasting 18 times as long. The sudden stop was accomplished
with the use of bucket scoops underneath the sled that dug into a
trough of water.
</P>
<P>
   How did it feel? ``It's like being assaulted in the rear by a
fast freight train,'' Stapp said. What did he think about as he
listened to the countdown? ``I said to myself, `Paul, it's been a
good life,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, he was blinded, but recovered his sight in a
couple of hours. He ended up with two black eyes because his
eyeballs had shot forward in their sockets.
</P>
<P>
   Before the ride he had worried that he might become permanently
blind. ``I practiced dressing and undressing with the lights out so
if I was blinded I wouldn't be helpless,'' he said in a 1985
interview.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of this and 28 other high-speed rides was to study
the effects of bailing out of airplanes at supersonic speeds and to
find ways of keeping pilots safer.
</P>
<P>
   The experiments were just the most famous chapter in Stapp's
lifelong mission of testing the limits of human tissue in order to
make transportation safer. The results of his research helped in
areas as diverse as improving seat belts in cars and developing the
medical and psychological tests for choosing the first team of
Mercury astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   He became an early advocate of seat belts and shoulder harnesses
in cars and argued unsuccessfully that airlines should seat
passengers backward so that the entire back could absorb the shock
of a sudden stop.
</P>
<P>
   Stapp's views were also sought on the question of whether
traveling at the speed of light slowed aging, as Einstein had
theorized. He thought not.
</P>
<P>
   Stapp, who was known for his razor-sharp wit, suffered an injury
in the experiment that inspired Murphy's Law, after a somewhat less
rapid sled ride in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   An assistant, Capt. Edward Murphy Jr., had designed a harness to
strap the rider in. The harness held 16 sensors to measure the
acceleration, or G-force, on different parts of the body. There
were exactly two ways each sensor could be installed. Murphy did
each one the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   The result was that when Stapp staggered off the rocket sled
with bloodshot eyes and bleeding sores, all the sensors registered
zero. He had been restrained in vain.
</P>
<P>
   A distraught Murphy proclaimed the original version of the
famous maxim: ``If there are two or more ways to do something and
one of those results in a catastrophe, then someone will do it that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Stapp was born in Bahia, Brazil, the son of Baptist
missionaries. When he was 13, his parents enrolled him in the San
Marcos Baptist Academy in Texas. At Baylor University in Waco,
Texas, he began majoring in English, but then he nursed a
2-year-old cousin with severe burns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first time I had ever seen anyone die,'' Stapp
said. ``I decided right then I wanted to be a doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   He graduated with a science degree but could not afford to go to
medical school, so he stayed at Baylor and earned a master's degree
in zoology. He then earned a doctorate in biophysics at the
University of Texas. At 29, he entered medical school at the
University of Minnesota, where he earned a degree.
</P>
<P>
   In 1944, he joined the Air Force. He became fascinated with
``aviation medicine,'' which addressed the effects that
ever-increasing speeds and heights were having on the bodies and
minds of fliers.
</P>
<P>
   This led to his assignment in 1947 to Edwards Air Force Base in
California, where he began working with a rocket-propelled sled on
rails. He used a dummy for the first 32 trial runs before
attempting his first ride. The next day he doubled his speed.
</P>
<P>
   He was eventually transferred to Holloman Air Force Base in New
Mexico, where he got an even faster sled. Though he had begun to
let other volunteers take many of the rides, he suffered broken
ribs, hemorrhages in one eye, a concussion, an abdominal hernia, a
fractured coccyx and a shattered wrist. Because of concerns about
his health, the Air Force grounded him after his fastest ride,
overriding his requests that he be allowed to try for 1,000 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Stapp served in medical advisory and staff positions with the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the National
Advisory Committee on Aeronautics, among others. His many awards
included the Medal of Technology, presented to him by President
Bush in 1991. He was president of the American Rocket Society and
wrote more than 50 technical articles.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the Stapp Foundation, he led the annual Stapp Car
Crash Conference, which brought together automotive engineers,
trauma surgeons and other experts to examine how people died in car
crashes.
</P>
<P>
   He refused to marry until the rocket sled experiments ended. In
1958, he married Lillian Lanese, who had danced with the Ballet
Russe de Monte Carlo. She survives him, as does his brother,
Wilford, of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Stapp once said that the only lasting effects of his daredevil
experiments ``are all the lunches and dinners I have to go to
now.''

COUNCIL PROPOSES BAN ON ATM FEES FOR NONCUSTOMERS
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Calif., Conn., Iowa)  (See also ATM-FEES) 
(nk) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York City Council is planning legislation to
prohibit banks from charging fees to noncustomers who use their
automated teller machines. The bill, like measures passed in San
Francisco and Santa Monica, Calif., would affect consumers who are
now often charged two fees for doing business at banks where they
do not maintain accounts, council officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Such customers are often charged $1 to $2.50 in addition to
whatever their own bank may charge for processing a transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Council Speaker Peter Vallone said the bill would be drafted
within a month and could be passed before the end of the year.
``Somebody who needs a $20 bill for something might have to wind up
paying $2 or $3 for the privilege of withdrawing his or her own
money,'' he said. ``That's absolutely wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York bill, like the laws in San Francisco and Santa
Monica and like state laws in Connecticut and Iowa, would ban the
surcharges that customers pay to the bank that owns the money
machine. Each bank now decides what, if any, fees to charge its own
customers for ATM transactions at other banks. Such charges, known
as foreign transaction fees, would still be allowed under the
proposed law.
</P>
<P>
   The banking industry has opposed all of these measures; a
federal judge issued a preliminary injunction Monday barring San
Francisco and Santa Monica from enforcing their bans. Two major
banks in California have responded to the new laws by allowing only
their own depositors to use their ATM's.
</P>
<P>
   The industry is expected to mount particularly strenuous
opposition in New York, the center of the financial services
industry. ``This whole debate is based much more on emotion than it
is on logic,'' said John Hall, a spokesman for the American Bankers
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Banks say that the fees are necessary to pay for computer
software, equipment, networking services and other expenses and
that a bank does not benefit in any way by making its money
machines accessible to customers of competing banks. Customers can
always use their own bank's machines without charge, they say, and
customers who want the convenience of using another bank's machines
should pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Michael P. Smith, the president of the New York Bankers
Association, said his organization had requested a meeting with
Vallone to discuss the proposed legislation and hoped to dissuade
him from introducing it. ``We believe the proposal would be
injurious to the city of New York and to the consumers of bank
services and to the providers of those services,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that disclosure laws require machines to notify
customers of a charge and to offer the option of canceling the
transaction. ``You have the choice to use your own bank's
machine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   John Tamberlane, president for consumer financial services of
Republic National Bank, which aggressively promotes the fact that
it does not charge ATM fees, said individual institutions should be
allowed to set their own prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we suggesting that the clients of one bank can go into
another bank's tellers and use them?'' He added, ``It's a crazy
thing to be legislating.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics say that the surcharges penalize depositors who are
simply trying to retrieve their own money and that they belie the
notion that teller machines are supposed to make banking cheaper
and more convenient. Critics say the result is often a double
charge because the banks that own the money machines may also
receive a portion of the foreign transaction fees that many
customers pay to their own banks.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, then the chairman of the
Banking Committee, proposed eliminating the surcharges. The bill
was opposed by the banking industry and was not passed.

COCA-COLA BOTTLER DISCUSSES PRICE INCREASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Insisting that there had been no fundamental shift in strategy,
Coca-Cola Co.'s largest bottler told investors and money managers
in a rare conference call Monday that its decision to raise retail
prices earlier this year should improve the company's cash flow and
profitability despite a drop in volume.
</P>
<P>
   The increases in the United States and Canada by the bottler,
Coca-Cola Enterprises, were followed in recent weeks by an increase
in concentrate prices by Coca-Cola. Both companies have said that a
marketing campaign by Coca-Cola is supposed to persuade consumers
to pay more for Coke products after years of low prices brought on
by a price war with its rival, PepsiCo, and the emergence of
private-label soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
   The changes confused many on Wall Street, who had been
accustomed to using volume as the chief measure of success at both
companies. Share prices for Coke and its bottlers, and at other
soft-drink makers, have fallen sharply this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interdependence between the Coca-Cola Co. and Coca-Cola
Enterprises is firmly established,'' said Henry Schimberg, the
bottler's chief executive, who is set to retire at the end of next
month. ``CCE can't be successful at the expense of Coca-Cola, and
conversely, Coca-Cola can't be successful at the expense of CCE.''
</P>
<P>
   Schimberg added that although volume was flat for the year,
decreases in capital spending have helped create an additional $200
million in cash flow, which will be used to buy back stock. The
company is reducing its investment in cars, trucks and fillers,
said the bottler's chief operating officer, John Alm.
</P>
<P>
   Schimberg also indicated that prices would rise at the same rate
as inflation over the next several years. ``We'll continue to move
pricing forward in a rational manner,'' he said. Earnings
improvement is expected to come from more purchases made in the
highly profitable ``cold-drink'' segment of the soft-drink market,
which includes vending machines. For the year, sales in
supermarkets have fallen 6 percent, Alm said, while cold-drink
sales have risen at a double-digit rate.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts seemed mostly reassured after the conference call,
although several said only time would tell whether the Coca-Cola
strategy was effective. ``It's still going to be, show us the
volume,'' said Caroline Levy, a beverage analyst for Schroder &AMP; Co.

O'CONNOR SENDS BISHOPS AN IMPLIED FAREWELL
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With his health uncertain and his 80th birthday
approaching, Cardinal John O'Connor, the archbishop of New York,
sat out an annual gathering of American bishops this week. Instead,
he sent a letter of gratitude that seemed a moving farewell to his
spiritual brethren.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, which was read aloud Monday morning at the annual
conference of American bishops in Washington, O'Connor alluded to
his impending retirement. Under church law, cardinals lose the
right to vote in papal conclaves at age 80, but can continue to
vote in the bishops' conference until a successor is chosen. Pope
John Paul II has yet to name a replacement for O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I have no word whatsoever from our Holy Father who,
as we know, alone makes such decisions,'' the cardinal wrote to the
bishops, ``it would seem to me to be the height of
presumptuousness, in view of my becoming an octogenarian on the
forthcoming 15th of January, to anticipate continuing in office
much longer.''
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal devoted most of the letter to thanking the bishops
for the ``wonderful associations'' he had had during more than 20
years in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot recall a single difference or conflict that we have
not worked our way through in the best interest of the church
universal and of the church in the United States,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will be in my daily Masses and prayers, and I humbly ask a
little remembrance in yours,'' the note to the bishops said. ``It's
been a great ride.''
</P>
<P>
   The message comes as O'Connor struggles with ill health, fueling
intense, if whispered, speculation about his possible replacement.
</P>
<P>
   As intriguing as what the cardinal's missive said was what it
did not say. It made no mention at all of his illness. In late
August, a tumor was removed from the surface of his brain, and he
underwent radiation treatments into October. Last month, he was
hospitalized for a blood clot in his left leg and for dehydration
caused by the radiation.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal wrote that he had asked Bishop Joseph A. Fiorenza,
president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, to read
the letter aloud on his behalf, adding, ``I must confess that I
fear that I would become emotional were I to try to express it
orally.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Zwilling, a spokesman for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese
of New York, said that O'Connor had expected to attend the
conference when he sent the letter on Saturday, but that an
``urgent matter'' arose Sunday evening that kept him from
traveling. Zwilling declined to elaborate, but said the conflict
was not related to the cardinal's health. Although the cardinal
stumbled as Mass ended on Sunday, he was not injured and the fall
had nothing to do with his decision not to attend the conference,
Zwilling said.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal did not mention his illness in the letter, Zwilling
said, because it was unrelated to his reasons for writing. More
relevant, Zwilling said, was his age. At 75, all bishops are
required to submit their resignations to the Holy See, but so far,
Pope John Paul II has not accepted O'Connor's. ``He doesn't know
when Pope John Paul II will accept his retirement and appoint his
successor,'' Zwilling said.
</P>
<P>
   Fiorenza said that after he read O'Connor's message to the
bishops Monday, it received sustained applause. But he said he did
not consider the letter a sign that the cardinal's retirement was
imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just signifies that the cardinal is nearing 80 years old,''
Fiorenza said. ``He doesn't really know what the future holds, but
it did signify that whatever the future holds, he has enjoyed
immensely his association with the American bishops.''

EDITORIAL: THE MAYOR AND THE FIRST AMENDMENT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Nov. 16:
</P>
<P>
   On matters large and small, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani seems deaf to
free-speech concerns. For more than a year, the mayor has imposed
tight restrictions on the use of New York's City Hall steps for
public demonstrations, ostensibly for security reasons. On Sunday,
Councilwoman Christine Quinn was told by police guards that she
could not hold a press conference on the steps, even though she was
there with fewer than a dozen community members to draw attention
to the killing of a young gay man in his apartment in Harlem. Only
after she called Council Speaker Peter Vallone to intervene was she
allowed to hold the press conference.
</P>
<P>
   Under current rules, no more than 50 people are allowed in
rallies on the steps. All groups are supposed to obtain permits
from the police. But surely there is something wrong with rules
that require elected council members to get permission to hold a
news conference at their place of work. The rules raise
constitutional questions because they exempt some events sponsored
by the city, thus giving the administration the ability to
discriminate in favor of certain kinds of speech.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's record on First Amendment rights looks worse with
every new court ruling against him. Last week, federal District
Judge Allen Schwartz ruled that his administration had improperly
retaliated against Housing Works, an AIDS service organization, by
making it ineligible to receive federal grants controlled by the
city. The judge found that the actions violated the First Amendment
rights of Housing Works, which has been a vocal critic of the
mayor's AIDS policies.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, federal District Judge Robert Sweet ruled that
the manner in which the city decides on requests for temporary
commemorative street signs was arbitrary and violated free-speech
rights. Two days before that, another federal judge, Nina Gershon,
ruled that the mayor's efforts to withhold funds from the Brooklyn
Museum and to evict it from its building were unconstitutional
censorship.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani is still fighting a lawsuit, also brought by Housing
Works, to end the restrictions on rallies at the City Hall steps.
The case is in court before federal District Judge Harold Baer, who
has already rejected an earlier rule that limited demonstrations to
25 people. If Giuliani loses again on this case, it will add
another judicial rebuke to his First Amendment record.

BORDERS NAMES A NEW CHIEF FROM OUTSIDE BOOK INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Borders Group, the nation's second-largest bookseller,
reached outside the book industry Monday for a new chief executive,
appointing Greg Josefowicz, a food and drugstore executive, to
preside over its chain of nearly 300 bookstores and its electronic
outlet, Borders.com.
</P>
<P>
   Borders took pains to describe Josefowicz as an avid book
reader. Most recently, Josefowicz, 47, was the president of
Jewel-Osco, a Midwestern chain of 271 food stores and drugstores
where he got his start more than 30 years ago as a 16-year-old bag
boy.
</P>
<P>
   Josefowicz will succeed Robert DiRomualdo, the chairman who has
also been acting as interim president and chief executive.
DiRomualdo assumed that position after the unexpected departure
last April of the previous chief executive, Philip Pfeffer, a
longtime book industry executive who lasted five month at the
company. At the time, Borders, based in Ann Arbor, Mich., offered
little explanation for the short tenure other than that Pfeffer was
``not a good fit.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, DiRomualdo said that the company had chosen
Josefowicz because ``there's no substitute for a guy who has 31
years of retail experience in a very complex organization.'' He
added, ``We looked for someone who is not only smart and loved to
read but had a passion for what we do and is fanatical about
customer service.''
</P>
<P>
   Josefowicz said he thought that much of his marketing experience
at Jewel-Osco could easily apply to Borders, which has bookstores
in 50 states and four countries and plans to expand next year.
</P>
<P>
   But Josefowicz will be facing a fierce competition that he has
never encountered before _ the three-way battle among Amazon.com,
Barnesandnoble.com and Borders.com for online book sales that has
left Borders in a distant third place.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 12 months, Borders stock has lost about half its
value on concerns that it was losing market share to Amazon.com and
Barnesandnoble.com. On Monday, shares of Borders rose 75 cents, to
$14.0625.
</P>
<P>
   Josefowicz described electronic retailing on Monday as ``another
channel opportunity for retailers.'' He added, ``So, I think that
while it's obviously part of our arsenal now, it's one that will be
developed and enhanced.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
It took Randy Johnson, arguably the most dominant lefthander of the
decade, to outweigh 22 wins.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lacking only a flashy won-lost record, Johnson called the past
baseball season ``the best year of his career,'' and voters agreed
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson captured the National League Cy Young Award, edging the
Astros' Mike Hampton and becoming only the second pitcher to win
the award in both leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to think this award isn't solely based on wins and
losses,'' said Johnson, who was 17-9 with a 2.48 ERA for the
Arizona Diamondbacks. ``There was a lot more to the season I had
than wins and losses.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who was well short of Hampton's league-leading 22
victories, received 20 first-place votes, 11 second-place votes and
one third for 134 points in balloting by the Baseball Writers'
Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, who went 22-4 to lead the Astros to a third straight NL
Central title, was second with 11 first-place votes, 17 seconds and
four thirds for 110 points.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Kevin Millwood was third with 36 points. The Astros'
Jose Lima and Billy Wagner tied for fourth with three points each,
marking just the third time an NL team has placed three pitchers in
the top five.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Hampton were the only pitchers named on all 32
ballots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little disappointed. That's the nature of the game; you
want to win everything you do,'' said Hampton, who broke the
franchise record of 21 victories set by Joe Niekro in 1979. ``It
gives me a little something to work harder for next year.''
</P>
<P>
   With Hampton's second-place finish, Mike Scott (1986) remains
the only Cy Young winner in Astros history.
</P>
<P>
   While his record was less impressive than Hampton's, Johnson
overwhelmed the opposition in nearly every other category in his
first full season in the NL. The Big Unit, a 6-10 lefthander who
spent the final two months of 1998 with the Astros, led the league
in ERA and the majors in strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   In 272 innings, Johnson had 364 strikeouts, the fourth-highest
total ever. He finished 19 strikeouts short of the record 383 set
by Nolan Ryan in 1973. He struck out 10 or more batters 23 times,
matching the record Ryan set with the California Angels in '73, and
had a league-high 12 complete games.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest argument against Johnson was what he didn't have _
more wins. It wasn't entirely his fault _ in seven of his losses,
Arizona scored two runs or fewer, including a stretch in which the
Diamondbacks were shut out in four straight starts by Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   He finished strong, winning seven of his last eight decisions to
help the Diamondbacks to the NL West title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I've pitched extremely well and the opposing pitcher
has pitched that much better,'' said Johnson, who had a 1.41 ERA in
the stretch in which his team was blanked four straight times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have respectable numbers outside the won-lost record.
Unfortunately, people look at the won-lost record and evaluate the
year or your career on that, and it's not really fair sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who won the American League Cy Young with Seattle in
1995, joins Gaylord Perry as the only pitchers to win the honor in
each league. Perry won with Cleveland in 1972 and San Diego in
1978.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's Pedro Martinez, the Cy Young winner with Montreal in
1997, is expected to join the exclusive club when the AL award is
announced today.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Johnson, Hampton did not have an overpowering fastball to
pile up gaudy strikeout totals, relying instead on his defense.
Hampton, 27, posted career highs in wins, ERA (2.90), strikeouts
(177) and innings pitched (239).
</P>
<P>
   From June 24 to Sept. 18, Hampton did not lose a decision,
reeling off a major-league-best 11 consecutive victories. He picked
up two of his biggest wins late in the season against Cincinnati
and Los Angeles, the latter on the final day to clinch the division
title.
</P>
<P>
   ``He throws 100 mph and strikes out a lot of batters,'' Hampton
said of Johnson. ``I'm not that type of pitcher. I have to work
hard for everything I get. I can't come out and not have good stuff
and rare back and have a 100-mph fastball to rely on. It was a
close vote, and he's definitely deserving.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson watched Hampton break into the majors at age 19 in 1993
with the Mariners and has been impressed with his progression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he was the real deal when we were in Seattle,'' Johnson
said. ``He went on to Houston (in a December 1993 trade) and
flourished. He was just as deserving for the award. Unfortunately,
there has to be a loser. I wouldn't have minded co-winners.''
</P>
<P>
   Only three times since baseball began awarding Cy Youngs in both
leagues in 1967 has an NL pitcher with as many as 22 victories not
won the award.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's Juan Marichal won 26 games in 1968 but trailed
Bob Gibson, who was 22-9 with a 1.12 ERA and 28 complete games to
win both Cy Young and Most Valuable Player honors.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, Ron Bryant went 24-12 for the Giants but was beaten by
New York's Tom Seaver, who won 19 with a 2.08 ERA and 251
strikeouts. Atlanta's Tom Glavine and San Francisco's John Burkett
each won 22 in 1993 and finished behind Greg Maddux, who was 20-10
and led the league with a 2.36 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody deserved it, Mike Hampton did,'' Astros owner
Drayton McLane Jr. said. ``His 22 wins were so important to the
Houston Astros. We didn't have any wins to spare in order to win
our division. If he won any less, we would have been in trouble. It
would have been great for him to top off his season with the Cy
Young.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros were 29-5 in Hampton's starts. The Diamondbacks went
23-12 in Johnson's starts.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton credited his teammates for giving him the confidence to
be successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt pretty comfortable on the mound, something I've wanted
to get. It took six, seven years to get that point,'' Hampton said.
``It's been a gradual progression. You just can't jump in and say
`I'm a superstar.' I'm happy the way everything went this season.
I'm young; I'm still learning a lot about myself.''
</P>
<P>
   With Lima (21-10) and Wagner (39 saves), the Astros joined the
1974 Los Angeles Dodgers and 1998 Atlanta Braves as teams placing
three pitchers in the top five in the voting.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson earned a $250,000 bonus for winning the award. Hampton
receives a $50,000 bonus for finishing second.

SUPERSONICS DEFEAT NETS, 100-92 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The New Jersey Nets inspired yet more
dreams of a miraculous comeback on Monday night at the Continental
Arena, rallying from a 22-point third-quarter deficit to get the
crowd of 12,474 excited and their victimizers, the Seattle
SuperSonics, anxious.
</P>
<P>
   But the fervent charge that saw the Nets pull within 4 points
early in the fourth quarter turned out to be fruitless, only one
more tease in this two-week-old season that is growing worse with
every game.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics, playing for the fourth time in six days and closing
out a five-game Eastern Conference road trip, defeated the Nets,
100-92, dashing whatever optimism their hosts felt after playing
well in Friday's loss to Charlotte and lessening the belief and
that New Jersey will eventually turn its season around.
</P>
<P>
   After following the pattern they set in losses to Indiana,
Cleveland and, to a lesser degree, Phoenix, the Nets (1-6) rightly
drew no encouragement from their late-game rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to play when you're down 15, 20 points going into
the third or fourth quarter,'' said Stephon Marbury, who scored 11
of his game-high 24 points in the final period to spark the Nets'
rally. ``There's no pressure any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, there is pressure mounting around this increasingly
hapless team that for the second straight season is collapsing
under the weight of playoff expectations. The frustration and
tension that is beginning to circle the Nets manifested itself in a
pregame controversy that was sparked by the return of Kerry
Kittles.
</P>
<P>
   Kittles, who drew criticism for missing the season's first six
games while recovering from surgery on his right knee, decided to
play on Monday night after an afternoon conversation with General
Manager John Nash. Keith Van Horn, who on Friday vehemently
defended Kittles's decision not to come off the injured list, was
shocked and mystified by the change that three days had made.
</P>
<P>
   Aware that some Nets officials and players had grumbled about
Kittles' inordinately long rehabilitation, Van Horn said he
believed that his teammate and good friend had been pressured into
returning prematurely. Instead of being excited about Kittles's
return, he was stone faced and disgruntled.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty minutes later, after speaking with Kittles and Nash, Van
Horn retracted his statements, albeit in a sullen mode that implied
insincerity. The dispirited look never left Van Horn's face, not
during the announcement of the starting five and not during the
game. Playing a seemingly passionless game, Van Horn floundered
after scoring 6 of his 15 points to lead the Nets to a 14-6 lead in
the opening minutes.
</P>
<P>
   From there, he missed 12 of his next 15 shots, including seven
straight in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Both Van Horn and Kittles, who made 1 of 7 shots in scoring 3
points in 7 minutes, admitted that the situation had affected Van
Horn's play, and afterward Van Horn apologized in a much more
genuine manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt somewhat out of place,'' said Van Horn, who shot 6 for
21. ``I shouldn't have made those comments. It's none of my
business actually. It's between Kerry and the organization and I
apologize for making them. It was stupid. It did bother me, but I
still have to go out and play my game.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn was not alone in his futility. Ending the first quarter
down, 28-27, the Nets missed their first 14 shots of the second as
Seattle turned it into a laugher by taking a 57-43 halftime lead.
Most of the misses were long jump shots, which allowed the Sonics
to run considerably and notch 21 of their 31 fast-break points in
the first half. The Nets shot 35.6 percent from the field for the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Neither is Van Horn alone in his frustration. Marbury, who more
often than not has been all the Nets have going offensively, spoke
with Nash before the game about his disappointment with the team.
He is not hiding his disillusionment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm frustrated,'' said Marbury, who had five assists and shot
8 of 22 from the floor. ``I think I'm at my peak as far as
frustration. I'm working on new things to get mad at. I don't know
how to explain it. I've never been in a situation like this before.
Every day is hard. I've never lost this many games before _ in a
row. Not my whole life of playing basketball. It's something that's
totally different. It's brand new and it's not something I'm going
to adjust to. It's a battle for me.''
</P>
<P>
   On the floor with Marbury and Jamie Feick during the Nets' late
surge were the reserves Elliot Perry, Jim McIlvaine and Johnny
Newman, sparking Coach Don Casey to toss out the idea of a lineup
change. ``It's disconcerting because maybe we don't have the right
people out on the floor to start the game,'' Casey said. ``That's a
thought that has to be explored when you're 1-6.''
</P>
<P>
   After three baskets by Marbury and one each by Feick, McIlvaine
and Newman, the Nets found themselves within 83-79 with more than
eight minutes left to play. But Vin Baker reopened the deficit by
sinking three consecutive jumpers in scoring 8 of his 21 points in
the fourth.

SENIORS SUFFERING FROM HMO STICKER SHOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN BAVLEY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Johanna Roth's jaw
dropped when she got the news from HealthNet, her Medicare health
maintenance organization.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beginning next year, she'll have to pay full price for her
brand-name cholesterol drug instead of the $20 co-pay she's used
to. She'll pay $5 more for each visit to her primary care doctor
and $10 more to see a specialist.
</P>
<P>
   And hospital stays, which now are free, will cost her $200.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just so shocked,'' the 72-year-old Kansas City woman
said. ``It's a big jump. It's a really big jump. We have savings
you hope will last, but you never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the nation, seniors in Medicare HMOs are being hit
with the same kind of sticker shock: Benefits are being trimmed;
premiums and co-pays are being raised. Nearly 100 HMOs are pulling
out of areas they once served, leaving several hundred thousand
seniors looking for new plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the greatest (benefits) decline in a decade,'' said
Robert Berenson, an official of the Health Care Financing
Administration, the federal agency based in Baltimore that manages
Medicare. ``It may be a premonition of what's to come in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Enrollment in Medicare HMOs has burgeoned in recent years. HMOs
typically offer benefits that aren't covered by fee-for-service
Medicare or else require steep co-payments.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more popular HMO benefits are low-cost prescription
drugs and doctor visits, free hospital stays and extras such as
eyeglasses and hearing aids.
</P>
<P>
   The trade-off is that HMOs restrict choices of doctors and
hospitals, something seniors appear ready to accept. The number of
people in Medicare HMOs has increased every year since 1985. There
are now 6.3 million enrolled, including about 57,000 in the Kansas
City area.
</P>
<P>
   But Medicare HMOs are in financial trouble: Fierce competition
has forced HMOs to maintain benefits even as costs have increased.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding these problems is the Balanced Budget Act of 1997,
which ordered the Health Care Financing Administration to scale
back its annual payment increases to Medicare HMOs. When the law
was passed, these HMOs were considered overpaid.
</P>
<P>
   According to industry estimates, these new rules will cost HMOs
about $33 billion through 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Payments to Medicare HMOs will rise next year, on average, about
5 percent. In many urban areas, like Kansas City, the increases
will be as small as 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In Jackson County, for example, the federal government will pay
HMOs an average of $535.72 a month next year for each member.
That's just $10.50 more than this year.
</P>
<P>
   With health-care inflation running about 8 percent, it's not
just Medicare HMOs that are having a hard time, Berenson said. HMOs
in the commercial market also are raising premiums and pulling out
of unprofitable areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real thing happening is the plans are now experiencing
inflation, and they can't generate additional cost savings,''
Berenson said.
</P>
<P>
   Berenson disagreed, though, with industry contentions that the
Balanced Budget Act was the main cause of its Medicare problems.
</P>
<P>
   Although some Medicare HMOs may not be paid enough, ``HCFA
doesn't believe plans in aggregate are underpaid,'' he said. ``We
simply can't pay as much as the plans say they need.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress is working on a bill that may increase Medicare
payments to HMOs and offer financial incentives for them to serve
more areas. A vote is likely this week.
</P>
<P>
   The measures won't significantly affect HMO benefits next year,
experts say. But the HMO industry is heartened by any efforts to
address what it considers to be a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very important first step,'' said Karen Ignagni,
president of the American Association of Health Plans, the trade
organization representing HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Health Care Financing Administration study found that
reductions in benefits and the withdrawal of plans from some
regions will affect millions of people in 2000:
</P>
<P>
   - For the first time, all Medicare HMOs in the nation will
charge co-payments for prescription drugs. This year, more than 1
million Medicare beneficiaries had access to plans that offered
free drugs. HMO members, on average, will pay 21 percent higher
co-payments for brand-name drugs and 8 percent higher co-pays for
generics next year.
</P>
<P>
   - About 3 million beneficiaries will no longer have access to
plans that do not charge a monthly premium. Enrollees will pay on
average $15.84 in premiums each month, almost triple what they paid
this year.
</P>
<P>
   - Ninety-nine HMOs will reduce or drop their participation in
Medicare, affecting 327,000 enrollees. Of those, 79,000 will have
to return to traditional Medicare because there will be no other
HMOs available where they live.

U.N. ACCEPTS SOME BLAME FOR BOSNIAN MASSACRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan laid out in a
somber, self-critical report Monday the tragic story of how the
United Nations allowed the Bosnian Muslim ``safe area'' of
Srebrenica to be overrun in July 1995 by Bosnian Serbs, who then
systematically killed thousands of its men and boys.
</P>
<P>
   The fall of Srebrenica became a damaging symbol of the
organization's failure at peacekeeping in a new era of brutal civil
wars, and it demonstrated the inadequacy of a system that allowed
political considerations to color military decisions when troops
were under U.N. command.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tragedy of Srebrenica will haunt our history forever,''
the report concludes.
</P>
<P>
   The fall of Srebrenica and other towns that the Security Council
had identified as safe areas, but then refused to authorize enough
troops to defend, led four months later to the U.S.-sponsored
Dayton peace agreement and the introduction of a NATO-led
international military force in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   While blame is widely distributed in the U.N. report, the
organization's examination of its own record in Srebrenica breaks
new ground by effectively damning the diplomatic nicety of trying
to remain neutral and above the fray in civil conflict.
</P>
<P>
   This conclusion comes two months after Annan, taking a more
aggressive stance on crimes against civilian populations, startled
the opening session of this year's General Assembly by saying that
national borders would no longer protect leaders who abuse people
under their control.
</P>
<P>
   With his declaration and Monday's report, the United Nations is
saying that the time has come when it will have to take sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through error, misjudgment and the inability to recognize the
scope of evil confronting us we failed to do our part to save the
people of Srebrenica from the Serb campaign of mass murder,'' a
senior U.N. official said Monday, introducing the report. ``These
failings were in part rooted in a philosophy of neutrality and
nonviolence wholly unsuited to the conflict in Bosnia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In particular,'' this official said, ``the report makes clear
the inadequacy of the entire approach of the United Nations to the
Serb campaign of ethnic cleansing and mass murder, culminating at
Srebrenica.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan was then in charge of U.N. peacekeeping; Boutros
Boutros-Ghali was the secretary-general, in overall command.
</P>
<P>
   The report, based on about 100 interviews with a range of
international figures involved in Bosnia, singles out the Bosnian
Serb political and military leaders, Radovan Karadzic and Ratko
Mladic, as the ``architects and implementers of the attempted
genocide in Bosnia'' and criticizes all those who negotiated with
them rather than using military force against them in the early
stages of the war. It demands that they be brought to trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cardinal lesson of Srebrenica,'' the report says, ``is
that a deliberate and systematic attempt to terrorize, expel or
murder an entire people must be met decisively with all necessary
means.''
</P>
<P>
   The report on Srebrenica was released on the same day that the
three joint presidents of Bosnia, speaking to the Security Council
on the fourth anniversary of the Dayton agreement, pledged to
create the first integral national institutions for Bosnia. The
country is now divided into an ethnic Serbian republic and a
federation of Bosnian Muslim and Croat areas.
</P>
<P>
   A multiethnic border patrol will be established to help curb
cross-border terrorism, smuggling and corruption. A secretariat
will be created for the joint presidency, which has had no shared
staff, and a common passport for all Bosnians will be introduced.
The three presidents have also agreed to form a peacekeeping unit
of their own to contribute to the U.N. mission.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. diplomats said that while these may seem like small steps,
it took Richard Holbrooke, the author of the Dayton accord and now
chief U.S. representative at the United Nations, six hours Sunday
night to extract agreement on them.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say that the willingness of the three presidents _
Alija Izetbegovic, a Muslim; Ante Jelavic, a Croat, and Zivko
Radisic, a Serb _ to act jointly in issuing what they call their
Declaration of New York reflects some important changes in the
political atmosphere of the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The Bosnians now see their neighbors moving toward integration
in Europe and possible membership in the European Union _ a hope
that a fragmented, frequently dysfunctional Bosnian state cannot
possibly entertain.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, U.S. officials said, the crumbling economic power and
unstable political situation in Serbia, the major republic
remaining in Yugoslavia, mean that Serbia is no longer a beacon to
the Bosnian Serb republic, which is now economically stronger in
some ways than the Serbian motherland.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The officials said that in recent months displaced people in
Bosnia, apparently feeling more secure, have begun returning to
rural areas from which they were displaced as ethnic minorities
during the four-year Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this important act,'' Holbrooke said in the Security
Council on Monday, ``the presidents have taken a major step toward
consolidating the progress of the past few years _ and in doing so,
have helped Bosnia take another step toward fulfilling the vision
of Dayton: a unified, single democratic country.''
</P>
<P>
   Bosnian Muslims now control the Srebrenica city council, though
not without considerable fears for their own safety, officials say.
Elected in 1997 but unable to venture back to the town for more
than a year, they were among the survivors of the massacres in July
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Srebrenica was then under the guardianship of 110 Dutch
peacekeepers, who were no match for the Serbs who suddenly
surrounded and assaulted the town. The U.N. report on Monday says
that the Dutch commander had asked for NATO air support on four or
five occasions but was either turned down or, finally, provided
with two patrols that dropped only two bombs and left.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch government, however, feared that its troops might be
taken hostage and at least on one occasion strongly opposed
airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   The report says that the Dutch could have been more forthright
in reporting immediately after the incident what evidence they had
that a massacre was taking place. The study also faulted French and
British commanders leading U.N. troops for their reluctance to call
on NATO.
</P>
<P>
   But at the heart of the problem of protecting the safe areas _
Srebrenica, Zepa, Goradze, Bihac, Tuzla and Sarajevo _ was the
refusal of Security Council members, including the United States,
to authorize enough troops to do the job. Boutros-Ghali wanted
34,000; the Security Council authorized only 7,400. Later, U.S.
politicians blamed the secretary-general for the capture of most of
those enclaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the international community makes a solemn promise to
safeguard and protect innocent civilians from massacre,'' the
report says, ``then it must be willing to back its promise with the
necessary means.''

SENIORS SUFFERING FROM HMO STICKER SHOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN BAVLEY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A Kansas City Star
analysis of what local Medicare HMOs will offer next year turned up
many of the same trends:
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two HMOs, Cigna HealthCare and United HealthCare of the Midwest,
are pulling out of the Kansas City Medicare market in 2000; and a
third plan, Humana, will no longer serve Leavenworth and Miami
counties in Kansas. Altogether, that will leave about 3,500 Kansas
City area HMO members looking for new plans next year.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Medicare HMOs of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas
City will remain unchanged in 2000. However, the plans are closed
to new members while Blue Cross remedies administrative problems
found by a Health Care Financing Administration audit.
</P>
<P>
   Other plans, such as those offered by Humana and HealthNet, will
raise their premiums. Members of some plans, such as Principal
Health Care and Kaiser Permanente, will pay more for prescription
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Even one of the mainstays of HMO plans, free inpatient hospital
care, has been hit.
</P>
<P>
   HealthNet will charge a $200 co-payment per visit for inpatient
stays at a general or psychiatric hospital. Principal will charge
$25 a day for inpatient psychiatric treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the erosion of benefits, Roth expects to stay with
HealthNet. It's the only plan in town that includes her doctor of
12 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where else I'd go,'' Roth said. ``But it just
gets my goat.''
</P>
<P>
   HealthNet had no choice but to cut benefits because health
expenses have risen faster than Medicare reimbursements, said
company spokeswoman Cheryl Dillard.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, the cost of providing medical care to seniors is
expected to jump by 10 percent; prescription drug costs will
increase by 30 percent, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``After three years of holding off the tide, we needed to make
some changes,'' Dillard said. ``We hated to do it. It was hard.''
</P>
<P>
   To offer a zero-premium plan and maintain the prescription drug
benefit that enrollees considered important, HealthNet ``took some
hits in other areas,'' such as coverage of hospital stays, Dillard
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But even with the 2000 increases, we are still a really good
deal compared to Medicare alone or Medicare with supplemental
insurance,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That's also how Shirley Harrison, 73, of Kansas City, views her
Humana HMO. Even though she'll have to pay a $10 monthly premium
for the first time, and the cost of an ambulance ride will double
to $50, the plan is still worthwhile, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say, knowing how prices have been going up in
medicine that this isn't too bad,'' Harrison said.
</P>
<P>
   But for low-income seniors, who have enrolled in Medicare HMOs
to defray their costs, the benefit cuts could become a hardship,
said Patricia Smith, senior coordinator for health issues of the
American Association of Retired Persons.
</P>
<P>
   Many seniors, however, may not realize the extent of the changes
until next year when they're hit by higher out-of-pocket expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't look closely (at the list of benefits), you might
not get the full sense of what the changes are,'' Smith said. ``I
think we probably will see more concern through the year as more
people recognize the changes.''

HARRY TRUMAN'S TAILOR DIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM PERRIN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Sol Stolowy was Harry
Truman's tailor for more than 20 years but was not known to boast
about it.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Status did not mean much to Stolowy, a Leawood, Kan., man who
died early Monday morning at age 91.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very humble man. He never looked for honor,'' said
Stolowy's daughter, Laurel Rogovein of Overland Park, Kan. ``It was
the friendship of Truman that he loved.''
</P>
<P>
   Stolowy, a Polish immigrant, arrived in Kansas City in the 1920s
and went to work at the Kansas City Custom Garment Co. In the early
1950s he bought the company.
</P>
<P>
   At its peak in the late '50s and early '60s, the company on 10th
Street employed more than 100 and turned out 600 suits a week.
</P>
<P>
   Truman was not Stolowy's only prominent customer. He also made
suits for Clarence Kelley, a Kansas City police chief and later FBI
director; Hank Stram, a Chiefs coach; and H. Roe Bartle, a Kansas
City mayor.
</P>
<P>
   One of Stolowy's memories of Truman was a conversation that he
recounted for a reporter more than 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day I said to him, `You know, Mr. President, I come from
Poland, and never could this happen for a Jewish boy to be making
clothes for a president. Only in America.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And he says: `In the U.S., anything can happen. I was a farm
boy, and I became president.' &UR; ''
</P>
<P>
   Rogovein said a raincoat that still hangs in the foyer of the
Truman home in Independence was made by her father.
</P>
<P>
   Truman was still president when Stolowy first made a suit for
him. Two of Truman's local friends referred him to Stolowy. In
1972, Truman died and was buried in a suit Stolowy made for him
earlier that year.
</P>
<P>
   Stolowy worked long hours in his business, habitually rising at
5 a.m. and arriving before 7. He worked late into the evenings, and
sometimes half-days on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   He closed his company in the early 1980s but opened a small
tailor shop across the street a week later. He retired in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Stolowy remained active in retirement, making vests for friends
and family members, both male and female. He also donated vests for
sale at the Truman Library.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a glow, a twinkle, a love of life and a love of
people that came forth in him,'' said Rabbi Alan Cohen, a family
friend for 10 years. ``He had a wonderful way of making people feel
comfortable and important around him.''
</P>
<P>
   Services will be at 1:30 p.m. today.

KANSAS SEEKS $1.5 MILLION FINE FROM ONLINE UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE CARROLL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The president of the
online Monticello University should be fined $1.5 million for
deceiving students, Kansas authorities say.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leslie Edwin Snell, a former Olathe resident, also should be
forced to pay damages to students, the state attorney general's
office states in a motion filed last week in Johnson County
District Court.
</P>
<P>
   The state filed a civil lawsuit in August against Snell and
about a dozen entities with which Snell is associated, including
Monticello, formerly was known as Thomas Jefferson University.
</P>
<P>
   The suit accuses Snell of violating the state's Consumer
Protection Act, its Charitable Organizations and Solicitations Act,
its General Corporation Code and its common law prohibiting the
unauthorized practice of law.
</P>
<P>
   Monticello misled students by promising ``real'' college degrees
when the degrees were not recognized by any accrediting agency
acknowledged by the U.S. Department of Education, the state said.
In addition, the state said, the university's advertisements and
brochures led students to think that the university had trained
faculty and staff when it had not.
</P>
<P>
   Snell, who put his Cedar Creek home up for sale and is thought
to have moved to Dallas, has failed to respond to the charges in
the time period allowed by law, according to the motion filed Nov.
9. Snell should be found guilty by default, the state says.
</P>
<P>
   The state's request is to go before District Judge Larry McClain
on Nov. 30. The judge could find Snell guilty and assess penalties
at that time, state Assistant Attorney General Derek Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   Snell could not be reached Monday. But he has denied wrongdoing
in previous communications with The Kansas City Star and in papers
filed with the district court.
</P>
<P>
   In a Sept. 3 fax to McClain, which has been made part of the
court file, Snell wrote that he could not afford an attorney to
defend him because the state had frozen his assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about my right to due process, my right to hire counsel,
my right to privacy, my right not to have my name defamed without
benefit of a fair judicial hearing?'' Snell wrote. All the
information in Monticello's brochures is true, Snell wrote, so
``how can this material be construed to be deceptive? How can truth
be untruth at the same time?
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that this can happen in America in our day and time
has Thomas Jefferson rolling in his grave. The American Revolution
is not over.''
</P>
<P>
   Snell says Kansas has no authority over Monticello because
Monticello did not do business in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Snell worked out of an Overland Park office building owned by
one of his entities. The building was home to Education Management
Associates, a Snell entity that provided educational services.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have not been able to find any home office for
Monticello other than the Overland Park office, which is off
College Boulevard. The Web site, www.monticelloui.org, has listed
several mailing addresses. One was in the West Indies.
</P>
<P>
   As of July, Monticello had done business with about 250
students, the state's motion says. Monticello has been incorporated
in Hawaii since February 1998. Thomas Jefferson University was
incorporated in Hawaii in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas officials, with the court's permission, have frozen
accounts related to Snell in three area banks. The accounts total
less than $40,000, court documents show.
</P>
<P>
   The court, at the state's request, has agreed that proceeds from
the sale of the Overland Park office building should be sent to the
court. The building is worth roughly $860,000, court documents say.
</P>
<P>
   Snell's Cedar Creek home, which had a for-sale sign in front of
it Monday, is listed at $549,950, according to a real-estate
agent's flier. Schmidt declined to say whether the state would try
to recover any proceeds from that sale.

 &HT;    McConaughey fined $50 for noisy bongo playing
 &HT;    By Jason Spencer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Actor Matthew McConaughey forked over a $50
noise violation fine Wednesday for his recent night of naked bongo
drumming, and prosecutors dropped more serious charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   McConaughey, 30, pled guilty to violating the city noise
ordinance _ a Class C misdemeanor _ by playing his bongos into the
wee hours of Oct. 25. In exchange, Travis County Attorney Ken Oden
agreed to dismiss a Class A misdemeanor charge of resisting
transport, punishable by as much as a year in jail and a $4,000
fine.
</P>
<P>
   McConaughey was out of the country Wednesday and could not be
reached for comment, but his lawyer said the actor was pleased with
the plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the officer had issued him this ticket from the beginning,
it wouldn't have been a problem,'' attorney Joe Turner said. ``The
only thing Matthew did wrong was some bad bongo playing.''
</P>
<P>
   The plea bargain marks the conclusion of an embarrassing few
weeks in which McConaughey's legal troubles became fodder for news
entertainment programs and talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   It started when Austin police, responding to a noise complaint,
confronted McConaughey inside his Tarrytown, Texas home. Officers
said they entered the home after spotting through a window what
they suspected to be a marijuana bong on a table and a nude
McConaughey dancing and playing bongo drums as a clothed man
clapped.
</P>
<P>
   Police accused the star of ``A Time to Kill'' and ``EdTV'' of
shoving an officer as they tried to load him in the back of a
patrol car.
</P>
<P>
   Officers initially planned to file marijuana possession charges
against McConaughey, but a municipal court judge tossed out that
complaint after determining police did not have probable cause to
enter the home without a warrant.
</P>
<P>
   In the investigation after the arrest, several of McConaughey's
neighbors stepped forward to bolster the actor's contention that he
did not resist officers' efforts to take him into custody, Oden
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The neighbors told my investigators he was angry and
back-talking the officers but was not physically resisting them,''
Oden said.
</P>
<P>
   The follow-up investigation also brought to light other
previously undisclosed facts surrounding the case, Oden said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was amused to see that the allegations of his nudity were
overstated. By the time we had seen the details of the official
reports, it turns out he was not naked. He was wearing a UT bandana
_ on his cranium,'' Oden said, anticipating the next question. ``In
this town, that might constitute a welldressed man.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan laid out in a
somber, self-critical report Monday the tragic story of how the
United Nations allowed the Bosnian Muslim ``safe area'' of
Srebrenica to be overrun in July 1995 by Bosnian Serbs, who then
systematically killed thousands of its men and boys.
</P>
<P>
   The fall of Srebrenica became a damaging symbol of the
organization's failure at peacekeeping in a new era of brutal civil
wars, and it demonstrated the inadequacy of a system that allowed
political considerations to color military decisions when troops
were under U.N. command.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tragedy of Srebrenica will haunt our history forever,''
the report concludes.
</P>
<P>
   The fall of Srebrenica and other towns that the Security Council
had identified as safe areas, but then refused to authorize enough
troops to defend, led four months later to the U.S.-sponsored
Dayton peace agreement and the introduction of a NATO-led
international military force in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   While blame is widely distributed in the U.N. report, the
organization's examination of its own record in Srebrenica breaks
new ground by effectively damning the diplomatic nicety of trying
to remain neutral and above the fray in civil conflict.
</P>
<P>
   This conclusion comes two months after Annan, taking a more
aggressive stance on crimes against civilian populations, startled
the opening session of this year's General Assembly by saying that
national borders would no longer protect leaders who abuse people
under their control.
</P>
<P>
   With his declaration and Monday's report, the United Nations is
saying that the time has come when it will have to take sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through error, misjudgment and the inability to recognize the
scope of evil confronting us we failed to do our part to save the
people of Srebrenica from the Serb campaign of mass murder,'' a
senior U.N. of come when it will have to take sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through error, misjudgment and the inability to recognize the
scope of evil confronting us we failed to do our part to save the
people of Srebrenica from the Serb campaign of mass murder,'' a
senior U.N. official said Monday, introducing the report. ``These
failings were in part rooted in a philosophy of neutrality and
nonviolence wholly unsuited to the conflict in Bosnia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In particular,'' this official said, ``the report makes clear
the inadequacy of the entire approach of the United Nations to the
Serb campaign of ethnic cleansing and mass murder, culminating at
Srebrenica.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan was then in charge of U.N. peacekeeping; Boutros
Boutros-Ghali was the secretary-general, in overall command.
</P>
<P>
   The report, based on about 100 interviews with a range of
international figures involved in Bosnia, singles out the Bosnian
Serb political and military leaders, Radovan Karadzic and Ratko
Mladic, as the ``architects and implementers of the attempted
genocide in Bosnia'' and criticizes all those who negotiated with
them rather than using military force against them in the early
stages of the war. It demands that they be brought to trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cardinal lesson of Srebrenica,'' the report says, ``is
that a deliberate and systematic attempt to terrorize, expel or
murder an entire people must be met decisively with all necessary
means.''
</P>
<P>
   The report on Srebrenica was released on the same day that the
three joint presidents of Bosnia, speaking to the Security Council
on the fourth anniversary of the Dayton agreement, pledged to
create the first integral national institutions for Bosnia. The
country is now divided into an ethnic Serbian republic and a
federation of Bosnian Muslim and Croat areas.
</P>
<P>
   A multiethnic border patrol will be established to help curb
cross-border terrorism, smuggling and corruption. A secretariat
will be created for the joint presidency, which has had no shared
staff, and a common passport for all Bosnians will be introduced.
The three presidents have also agreed to form a peacekeeping unit
of their own to contribute to the U.N. mission.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. diplomats said that while these may seem like small steps,
it took Richard Holbrooke, the author of the Dayton accord and now
chief U.S. representative at the United Nations, six hours Sunday
night to extract agreement on them.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say that the willingness of the three presidents _
Alija Izetbegovic, a Muslim; Ante Jelavic, a Croat, and Zivko
Radisic, a Serb _ to act jointly in issuing what they call their
Declaration of New York reflects some important changes in the
political atmosphere of the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The Bosnians now see their neighbors moving toward integration
in Europe and possible membership in the European Union _ a hope
that a fragmented, frequently dysfunctional Bosnian state cannot
possibly entertain.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, U.S. officials said, the crumbling economic power and
unstable political situation in Serbia, the major republic
remaining in Yugoslavia, mean that Serbia is no longer a beacon to
the Bosnian Serb republic, which is now economically stronger in
some ways than the Serbian motherland.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The officials said that in recent months displaced people in
Bosnia, apparently feeling more secure, have begun returning to
rural areas from which they were displaced as ethnic minorities
during the four-year Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this important act,'' Holbrooke said in the Security
Council on Monday, ``the presidents have taken a major step toward
consolidating the progress of the past few years _ and in doing so,
have helped Bosnia take another step toward fulfilling the vision
of Dayton: a unified, single democratic country.''
</P>
<P>
   Bosnian Muslims now control the Srebrenica city council, though
not without considerable fears for their own safety, officials say.
Elected in 1997 but unable to venture back to the town for more
than a year, they were among the survivors of the massacres in July
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Srebrenica was then under the guardianship of 110 Dutch
peacekeepers, who were no match for the Serbs who suddenly
surrounded and assaulted the town. The U.N. report on Monday says
that the Dutch commander had asked for NATO air support on four or
five occasions but was either turned down or, finally, provided
with two patrols that dropped only two bombs and left.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch government, however, feared that its troops might be
taken hostage and at least on one occasion strongly opposed
airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   The report says that the Dutch could have been more forthright
in reporting immediately after the incident what evidence they had
that a massacre was taking place. The study also faulted French and
British commanders leading U.N. troops for their reluctance to call
on NATO.
</P>
<P>
   But at the heart of the problem of protecting the safe areas _
Srebrenica, Zepa, Goradze, Bihac, Tuzla and Sarajevo _ was the
refusal of Security Council members, including the United States,
to authorize enough troops to do the job. Boutros-Ghali wanted
34,000; the Security Council authorized only 7,400. Later, U.S.
politicians blamed the secretary-general for the capture of most of
those enclaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the international community makes a solemn promise to
safeguard and protect innocent civilians from massacre,'' the
report says, ``then it must be willing to back its promise with the
necessary means.''

EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYERS FEEL THE PAIN OF RISING HEALTH-CARE
PREMIUMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIUS A. KARASH  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANAS CITY, Mo. _ Week after week,
negotiations dragged on in September and October at Mallin Bros.
Co. Inc., a 71-year-old Kansas City scrap metal company.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The subject of the negotiations was health insurance for
Mallin's 20 or so employees, who chop up discarded copper wire and
recycle it into copper pellets.
</P>
<P>
   Mallin Bros. President Jeffrey Mallin finally signed a new
policy and swallowed a premium increase of 19 percent. The company
shouldered the entire premium cost but is feeling the strain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting out of hand,'' Mallin said. ``It's a balancing
act between being financially responsible for your company and
trying to give your employees the same benefit package they've been
receiving.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Kansas City area and across the country,
thousands of other businesses are wrestling with the same dilemma.
Industry experts say corporate health-care costs will rise by 7
percent to 25 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers vary widely, with the highest rate increases hitting
small businesses and consumers who have individual policies.
</P>
<P>
   Business owners may feel compelled to offer health insurance to
attract and keep qualified workers, but crunching the numbers can
give them nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't keep up with 15- to 20-percent rate increases,''
said Mark Whiting, a principal with the Kansas City office of the
William M. Mercer Inc. benefits consulting firm. ``It's not
tolerable. It eats into their bottom lines too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Many business owners face these rising costs with resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like electricity bills,'' said Jan Fichman, owner of
the 7th Heaven music and accessories stores in the Kansas City
area, Lawrence and Sedalia.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some things businesses can do to lighten their
health cost burden a bit. Some shift more costs to employees, while
others seek out special programs.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Wilcoxson, a St. Louis-based benefits consultant with
Hewitt Associates, said employers typically pay about 80 percent of
premium costs, with employees paying the rest, though the range may
vary widely.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the split, Wilcoxson said many of his clients are
making their workers pay a bigger share of the premium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our clients want to continue covering the benefit, but as the
costs are dramatically increasing, they also have to consider their
bottom line,'' Wilcoxson said.
</P>
<P>
   However, many employers hesitate to make their workers pay more
for fear of losing those workers in a competitive labor market,
Whiting said.
</P>
<P>
   In a report issued Nov. 9, Hewitt Associates said companies are
seeing rate increases of 8 percent to 10 percent for next year.
That represents a significant boost over this year's average rate
increase of 7.8 percent, which was the highest rise since the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt, an Illinois-based management consulting firm, said that
next year, most major companies will pay an average of $4,853 in
health-care costs for each employee, up from $4,412 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts give several reasons for the revved-up rates,
including expensive medical technology, legislative mandates on
HMOs and the rising cost of prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Bowser, executive vice president and chief operating officer
of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City, said drug costs for
the area's largest insurer are going up 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some argue that new drugs, even expensive ones, save on health
care in the long run. But that argument provides little or no
comfort to those caught in the vise of rising costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's undeniable that these drugs keep people out of the
hospital and reduce the need for surgery, but those benefits are
not measurable,'' Whiting said.
</P>
<P>
   And ``lifestyle'' drugs, such as Celebrex for arthritis, may do
little to keep people out of the hospital, Whiting said.
</P>
<P>
   Also driving costs up are managed-care companies looking for
higher premiums to boost their/ bottom lines. On the provider side,
doctors and hospitals say they've been cut to the bone by reduced
fees and are demanding more compensation.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, consumers demand that health plans not limit
their choices of doctors, hospitals and treatments. More choice may
contribute to higher costs.
</P>
<P>
   There also has been some speculation that premiums will be
pushed up by a move to give doctors more control over patient-care
decisions, such as the policy announced last week by
UnitedHealthcare.
</P>
<P>
   UnitedHealthcare, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, said it no
longer would require doctors to seek approval before recommending
medical treatment or hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another year of turmoil in the health-care industry,''
Jack Bruner of Hewitt said in a statement. ``With no clear answer
to any of these issues, health-care costs will continue to rise,
leaving companies to wonder how much longer they can afford to
offer health care to their employees.''
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, some companies feel that they can't afford to
offer as much as they used to. Pete Spalitto, owner of Spalitto's
Prescription Pharmacy on Independence Avenue, said many of his
customers have been hit with higher prescription costs because
their employers have cut back on drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Spalitto said two of his customers were unable to pick up their
prescriptions recently because they had exceeded the annual limit
of what their health plans would pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were pretty upset,'' Spalitto said. ``There's a lot of
anxiety when you can't afford to get your prescription filled.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors are seeing their patients fight similar battles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past year, we have had many patients whose care was
interrupted or threatened to be interrupted because they couldn't
afford to get the insurance policy they wanted,'' said Richard
Hellman, an endocrinologist and president-elect of the Metropolitan
Medical Society of Greater Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   E.J. Holland Jr., assistant vice president for corporate
benefits at Sprint Corp., said Sprint expects its health-care costs
to go up between 9 percent and 15 percent in the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Holland said Sprint, the area's largest private employer, is
searching for better ways to buy high-quality health care.
</P>
<P>
   That search can be more difficult for small businesses, which
have less negotiating power and fewer employees to share insurance
risk.
</P>
<P>
   About half of businesses with 25 or fewer employees can't afford
to provide their workers with health insurance, said Shawne
McGibbon, assistant chief counsel for food, drug and health policy
at the U.S. Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The injustice is rather obvious,'' McGibbon said. ``Until some
sort of mechanism can be developed to control rising
health-insurance costs, it's unlikely that the rising number of
uninsured will be able to obtain health insurance in the near
future.''
</P>
<P>
   The quest for health insurance presents many tough choices.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Slosburg, president of the Daniel Slosburg Co. insurance
agency in Prairie Village, said he encourages his customers to
examine all the alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a business owner may have to choose between dental
coverage or disability coverage. Slosburg said he'd recommend a
disability plan, but many workers would prefer a dental plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you have to weigh what's best for the employees vs. what
the employees' perception is, and where the company is going to
spend its dollars,'' Slosburg said.
</P>
<P>
   Some turn to group plans designed for small businesses, such as
ChamberCHOICE, a program endorsed by the Greater Kansas City
Chamber of Commerce and operated by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Miles Ross, vice president of MHM Business Services in Kansas
City, said one of the best ways to save money on health insurance
is to use an Internal Revenue Code Section 125 tax savings plan.
</P>
<P>
   In what is known as a premium-only Section 125 plan, employees
pay their portion of insurance premiums on a pre-tax basis. The
arrangement saves money for both employees and employers, Ross
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Sprint's Holland said rising premiums will
ultimately affect everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, employees pay for all of these services,'' Holland
said. ``People think this hurts companies. It doesn't hurt
companies, it hurts consumers.''

some ways than the Serbian motherland.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The officials said that in recent months displaced people in
Bosnia, apparently feeling more secure, have begun returning to
rural areas from which they were displaced as ethnic minorities
during the four-year Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this important act,'' Holbrooke said in the Security
Council on Monday, ``the presidents have taken a major step toward
consolidating the progress of the past few years _ and in doing so,
have helped Bosnia take another step toward fulfilling the vision
of Dayton: a unified, single democratic country.''
</P>
<P>
   Bosnian Muslims now control the Srebrenica city council, though
not without considerable fears for their own safety, officials say.
Elected in 1997 but unable to venture back to the town for more
than a year, they were among the survivors of the massacres in July
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Srebrenica was then under the guardianship of 110 Dutch
peacekeepers, who were no match for the Serbs who suddenly
surrounded and assaulted the town. The U.N. report on Monday says
that the Dutch commander had asked for NATO air support on four or
five occasions but was either turned down or, finally, provided
with two patrols that dropped only two bombs and left.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch government, however, feared that its troops might be
taken hostage and at least on one occasion strongly opposed
airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   The report says that the Dutch could have been more forthright
in reporting immediately after the incident what evidence they had
that a massacre was taking place. The study also faulted French and
British commanders leading U.N. troops for their reluctance to call
on NATO.
</P>
<P>
   But at the heart of the problem of protecting the safe areas _
Srebrenica, Zepa, Goradze, Bihac, Tuzla and Sarajevo _ was the
refusal of Security Council members, including the United States,
to authorize enough troops to do the job. Boutros-Ghali wanted
34,000; the Security Council authorized only 7,400. Later, U.S.
politicians blamed the secretary-general for the capture of most of
those enclaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the international community makes a solemn promise to
safeguard and protect innocent civilians from massacre,'' the
report says, ``then it must be willing to back its promise with the
necessary means.''

EDITORIAL: SMOKE-FILLED ALBANY 
</HEADLINE>
  (xx)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Nov. 16:
</P>
<P>
   The rules for lobbying in Albany are so abysmally loose that
only occasionally does the outside world get a glimpse of how New
York state's Legislature can market its influence. Such a moment
arrived this year when the tobacco industry was forced to open its
files in state litigation around the country. The documents listed
how much money companies like Philip Morris had spent trying to
secure protection in places like Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Last week New York state's lobbying commission managed to get
Philip Morris to agree to pay $75,000, the highest fine the
commission has ever imposed, for underreporting lobbying expenses
in Albany from 1996 to 1998. The tobacco giant also agreed to bar
its chief Albany official from lobbying the Legislature for three
years.
</P>
<P>
   But Philip Morris was barely singed in the process. The state
attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, who has asked that a criminal
version of this matter be referred to his office, fumed that the
commission had been ``completely out-lawyered by Philip Morris,
bamboozled. They gave an absolution where none was deserved.''
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer may be overstating the case, since the commission can
still refer the Philip Morris matter for criminal prosecution.
Moreover, these same company documents could be used by the
secretive Legislative Ethics Committee to determine whether illegal
gifts were given by lobbyists and received by legislators with an
intent to influence legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The real travesty in Albany is the lobbying law itself. Set to
expire at the end of the year, with the commission then closing its
doors in March, the law gives the commission little power against
some of the nation's most powerful lobbyists. A strengthened law
should limit gifts and favors, impose a broader definition of
lobbying and allow the commission more freedom to levy higher
fines. A mere extension, as some state politicians want, would be a
reason for many lobbyists to take the nearest legislator out to
dinner to celebrate.

FARMLAND PLANS JOINT VENTURE WITH OTHER CO-OPS TO RUN FEED
OPERATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK DAVIS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANAS CITY, Mo. _ Farmland Industries
Inc. and merger partner Cenex Harvest States Cooperatives plan to
form a joint venture company with Land O'Lakes to own and run the
three co-ops' feed operations.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Land O'Lakes in Arden Hills, Minn., would run the feed company,
which has not taken a name, under a management contract. All three
co-ops would own the company, based on the economic interests each
brought to the company.
</P>
<P>
   The venture would include research and development, production,
distribution and marketing of formula feed and feed ingredients.
Other segments would involve animal health products and pet and
specialty products. The co-ops' feed manufacturing facilities and
other related assets would be included in the venture.
</P>
<P>
   Its sales would equal about $1.5 billion, based on the three
co-ops' 1998 operations.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary agreement on the feed venture is similar to one
the co-ops signed earlier to create a joint venture for their
agronomy operations. These include crop seed, plant food and crop
protection products. The agronomy venture, however, would be run by
co-presidents from Farmland and from Cenex/Land O'Lakes Agronomy
Co., which already combines their agronomy operations.
</P>
<P>
   Both ventures would take effect March 1. That is the same date
that Farmland and Cenex plan to merge into United Country Brands.
Their member owners will vote on the merger later this month.
</P>
<P>
   If the merger isn't approved, the joint venture agreements
``might have to be reconsidered,'' Farmland spokeswoman Sherlyn
Manson said.
</P>
<P>
   Manson said the effect on jobs was unknown at this point.
Farmland's feed division has about 150 employees at the co-op's
Kansas City headquarters. She said the feed venture's headquarters
probably would be in Arden Hills, Minn.

HELMUT NEWTON'S NEW BOOK, WITH COFFEE TABLE ATTACHED

 By CATHY HORYN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He calls her Junie and she calls him Helmie, and they
think nothing of photographing each other in the nude. But after 50
years of marriage and countless examples of their uniquely homey
intimacy _ he soaking in the family tub, she opening her blouse for
a postprandial peek _ June Newton says there's really no secret to
her union with her photographer husband, Helmut.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is one, we've never found it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Newton, a trim-looking woman in her early 70s, who
photographs under the name Alice Springs, was at Christie's on
Sunday night for a cocktail party given for her husband's latest
endeavor, a 480-page booked aptly titled ``Sumo.''
</P>
<P>
   To give an idea of just how big ``Sumo'' is, it weighs 66.1
pounds and comes with its own portable coffee table (a folding
metal stand designed by Philippe Starck), and if you had looked
down from the second-floor balcony at Christie's to the copy opened
in the lobby below, you could have, for example, clearly made out
Charlotte Rampling's right nipple.
</P>
<P>
   It also costs a whopping $1,500 (table included).
</P>
<P>
   Not that this is a deterrent. Its publisher, Benedikt Taschen,
said 7,000 of its 10,000 numbered and signed copies had already
been ordered by booksellers and individual buyers. Taschen, who
described the technical problems of producing such a mammoth volume
as a three-year headache, nonetheless gave an uncomplicated reason
for doing it in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to build a monument to the most important
photographer of the 20th century,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Newton, 79, is certainly one of the most controversial
photographers ever to apply the notion of sin to fashion and
celebrity. Born in Berlin in 1920 to prosperous Jewish parents (his
father, a dead ringer for the actor Erich von Stroheim, was a
button manufacturer), Newton didn't achieve real fame until the
1970s, when he was already middle-aged and had suffered a heart
attack.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1987 profile in Vanity Fair, June Newton said that the
heart attack somehow gave him the freedom to evoke the hedonistic
days of his youth.
</P>
<P>
   As Newton said in 1987, when his images of leather-bound
Valkyries could still rile feminists and magazine readers _
especially of American Vogue, which had more than 1,000
subscriptions canceled after a Newton shoot depicting two women, a
man and a couple of dogs in a sexual pose _ ``My generation had all
the fun in the world, because Berlin was as wild as it could be.
There was a surfeit of nice girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, of course, nobody gets terribly worked up by images of
naked women smiling cryptically through a haze of cigarette smoke
and couture veiling, largely because Newton, in his grandfatherly
status as ``the king of kink'' (to borrow a phrase that causes him
delinquent giggles), has inspired so many contemporary
photographers.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also true that Newton has always been something of an
enigma: an outsider who spent most of his early adult years in
Australia, his wife's native country; a self-described ``square''
who said he has never gotten excited by his erotic photo sessions;
a provocateur who can evoke the hidden, the unspeakable, yet who
seems to hate to be touched. When a hustling member of the
paparazzi corps working the cocktail party attempted to push him
into a cozy portrait with a young woman in a daring top, Newton
abruptly broke away, leaving the woman smiling awkwardly.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Capitan, a former Newton model who later became his
stylist, was standing near the railing, looking down at the big
book as guests slowly turned the heavy pages. ``There is always
some kind of story behind his work,'' she said. ``It's always more
than a picture.''

 NEW YORK: a picture.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As she spoke, the page turners stopped at an image of a nude
woman whose body was resting halfway inside the mouth of a stuffed
crocodile. Ms. Capitan smiled. She had been the stylist on that
shoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The girl's legs were so hairy,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Did they have to be shaved?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Capitan laughed. ``No, no,'' she said. ``He's into that.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, at the Mercer Hotel where he and his wife were staying,
Newton spoke about his big book, his marriage and his thoughts
about current fashion photography. He is a bit frail, though no
more so than one might expect for a person of his years, and he has
an unhurried, almost mischievous manner. When a visitor stopped at
a picture of a model in lingerie and remarked that she had a
similar rig, Newton smiled and said in his Good Doctor tone, ``Tell
me more.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his initial response to Taschen's monumental proposal, Newton
said: ``He was very smart. He brought a cardboard dummy of the book
to show me with several of my pictures in it. The first one was of
my wife sitting half naked in our kitchen.'' Newton laughed
hoarsely. ``Anyway,'' he went on, ``I said yes, like a fool. It
meant a year of sleepless nights worrying about the quality of the
reproduction.'' He said he was happy with the book, which his wife
largely edited from his archives, including pictures that had never
before been published.
</P>
<P>
   As the visitor stopped at another page, this one with a model in
a bra and a saddle, Newton mused, ``I've always been accused of _
what's the word?''
</P>
<P>
   Decadence?
</P>
<P>
   ``Decadence!'' he roared ``And I was very pleased about that.''
He looked at the picture. ``It's not very daring,'' he said.
``There's no nudity. Of course, the saddle was probably the most
expensive saddle there is. Hermes.''
</P>
<P>
   He isn't very impressed by current photography. ``There's a lot
of pornographic pictures taken by the young today,'' he said.
``There's a magazine, Purple.'' He frowned. ``A lot of the nudity
is just gratuitous. But someone who makes me laugh is David
LaChapelle. I think he's very bright, very funny, and good.''
</P>
<P>
   Newton has managed to be so daring within the context of a
decades-long contract with Conde Nast. He has not needed so-called
avant-garde forums like Visionaire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone from Visionaire called me up and said they couldn't
give me a lot of money but that I could do any kind of picture I
want.'' He snorted. ``I said, `Listen, I get a lot of money and I
still do what I want.''
</P>
<P>
   For many years, Newton and his wife have divided their time
between an apartment in Monte Carlo and a suite at the Chateau
Marmont in Los Angeles. He danced around the subject of his
marriage, then said: ``I'm very lucky. I mean, June's a pretty rare
woman. Intelligent. Supportive.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I never believe what young people say, that you
become a unit, that if you love each other, you become like one
person.''
</P>
<P>
   He smiled. ``It's rather horrifying to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He paused over an image of a woman walking through a darkened
Paris street in nothing but an open fur coat. Published in the
1970s in French Vogue, it was one of the images that made Newton's
reputation. Now, he said it was inspired by an old German story.
</P>
<P>
   Newton clucked his tongue. ``Every European boy,'' he said,
``lives with the notion _ maybe not anymore, but certainly in my
generation _ that he will meet that girl in the coat.''

CASINO OFFICIALS AND CUSTOMERS APPLAUD OPEN BOARDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Bonnie and Ken
Waterman did something unusual Monday morning.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The mother and son from Wyandotte County in Kansas passed
through Argosy Riverside Casino's turnstiles at 8:46 a.m., becoming
that gambling boat's first open-boarding guests and among the first
in the metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great,'' said Bonnie Waterman. ``I don't like to wait to
lose my money.''
</P>
<P>
   The open-door policy, now authorized statewide by the Missouri
Gaming Commission, allows customers to enter a casino at any time.
Gamblers still are limited to buying no more than $500 in chips or
gambling tokens every two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Under open boarding, players must have a club card that is
swiped electronically. It monitors their compliance with the $500
rule and tracks them as they gamble, exit and re-enter the casino.
</P>
<P>
   Most riverboats have added extra sign-up stations for club
cards. The process takes a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, the new club card system eliminates the need
to stand in line for a paper boarding ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a nuisance,'' Kansas City retiree John Riley said
Monday of Missouri's complex boarding rules. ``People from out of
town just didn't understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the old rule, patrons could enter a casino only during the
first 45 minutes of each two-hour ``cruise'' session. If they left,
they could not reboard until the next cruise.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Gaming Commission adopted the rule in 1994 to
equalize competition in St. Louis among Missouri-based boats that
cruised and others that were permanently docked.
</P>
<P>
   When casino boats on the Illinois side of the Mississippi River
abandoned similar boarding rules this summer, Missouri boats
lobbied the commission for a level playing field.
</P>
<P>
   Open boarding in St. Louis started in August. Admissions and
revenue are up dramatically since.
</P>
<P>
   Local gamblers will notice a few other changes.
</P>
<P>
   Station Casino's River Queen will be closed Monday through
Friday until 5 p.m. The mirror-image River King has been
reconfigured and restocked with a wider variety of games and has
more entrances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll learn as we go,'' said John Finamore, Station's Midwest
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no layoffs. We were able to shift the work force
from one boat to the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrah's smaller North Star vessel will open at 11 a.m. instead
of 9 a.m. Monday through Friday, said Harrah's marketing director,
Pucka Tomasic. That boat's last weekday cruise in the early morning
hours also will be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   In coming weeks, guests at Harrah's can also expect to be met by
an usher to answer questions about open boarding and help smooth
the club card sign-up process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipate guests whose patterns of behavior will still
mimic the top-of-the-hour rush,'' Tomasic said. ``It's going to
take a few months for the market to flatten out.''
</P>
<P>
   Open boarding is a welcome change at the single-boat Argosy and
Flamingo Hilton casinos, where the wait between sessions was 75
minutes and drove business away.
</P>
<P>
   The twin boat operations staggered their cruise schedules and
cut the wait to 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pain,'' said Erma Madck of Kansas City, North,
shortly before 8 a.m. Monday while waiting for the Flamingo Hilton
Casino to open for business.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's times I want to eat and then go back down (on the
casino floor). You can do that anywhere but in Missouri,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's wonderful,'' said Frank Payne of Basehor, who
also was in line at the Flamingo first thing Monday morning. ``I
don't like waiting in lines. I had enough of that in the Navy.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Lopez of Kansas City, North, said open boarding wouldn't
have much effect on the morning gambling expeditions he and his
wife regularly take to the Flamingo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We come early to be the first ones on board and get the (slot)
machines we want,'' he said. ``We'll have to wait (for the casino
to open) tomorrow morning too.''

KANSAS AND MISSOURI OPPOSE SWEEPSTAKES SUIT SETTLEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL WENSKE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANAS CITY, Mo. _ The attorneys general
for Missouri and Kansas joined with 19 other states Monday to
oppose a private, multimillion-dollar class-action settlement with
sweepstakes giant Publishers Clearing House.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The state attorneys general said the settlement would do
consumers ``more harm than good.'' The notice of opposition was
sent to U.S. District Judge J. Patrick Murphy, who will hear
arguments Jan. 25 in East St. Louis, Ill., on whether the
settlement is fair.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys in the private class-action case and officials with
Publishers Clearing House responded that the settlement would
benefit consumers. They questioned the motives of the attorneys
general and disputed their contentions and figures.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon, who last month filed his
own civil lawsuit against Publishers Clearing House, called the
private settlement ``fundamentally flawed.'' He said it ``sets up a
restitution pool that is far too small'' and doesn't require
adequate changes in Publishers Clearing House's marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas Attorney General Carla Stovall has not sued the company
but has cautioned consumers that the money available in the private
class action is ``approximately $4 million, and this amount is not
enough to provide a full refund to everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys general have also contended that private lawyers
will profit most from the settlement, with fees totaling up to $3
million.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Sprong, one of the lawyers who filed the private
class-action case, said Publishers Clearing House had agreed to
refund 100 cents on the dollar to plaintiffs who filed claims in
the case. He challenged the attorneys general to show how the
settlement was unfair.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that the settlement of claims probably would
surpass $12 million and that attorney fees would be separate from
that amount.
</P>
<P>
   Publishers Clearing House and other sweepstakes companies have
come under growing scrutiny. Congress has conducted hearings on the
marketing of magazines, books and other products through tactics
that lead some people to think they have won millions of dollars in
a sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Irving, a Publishers Clearing House spokesman, said
the settlement was fair and comprehensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attorneys general would have you believe we decided this
on our own when, of course, plaintiffs' attorneys agreed to it and,
in fact, a federal judge gave it preliminary approval,'' Irving
said.
</P>
<P>
   Notices of the private settlement were mailed to about 42
million people. But officials said Monday that they didn't know how
many people had filed claims or had formally opted out of the
class-action settlement by the deadline of Nov. 5.
</P>
<P>
   However, attorneys in the case said people who did not file
claims for refunds on goods they bought from Publishers Clearing
House probably would get nothing from the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they said people who did not formally opt out of
the class could not now file an individual lawsuit against
Publishers Clearing House.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys were less certain on whether Publishers Clearing House
customers who neither filed a claim nor opted out of the case could
seek reimbursement from a case filed by an attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Some consumer advocates said the notices sent to potential
claimants were complicated and difficult to understand.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Zuckerman, a staff attorney for the AARP Foundation,
which advocates for senior citizens, said her organization also
opposed the private settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was difficult for people to understand what their options
were. ... They made the process for opting out of the class more
difficult,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said a hot line set up by AARP for members to phone in with
questions was quickly overloaded.

<P>
   PHOENIX _ The Los Angeles Lakers activated a guard from the
injured list Monday, but it wasn't Kobe Bryant. That move might
happen by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, they'll see what John Celestand can do. The
6-foot-3 rookie joined the active roster to replace second-year
guard Tyronn Lue, who went to the injured list with a sore right
knee.
</P>
<P>
   Celestand, a second-round pick in June, came to training camp as
a long shot but played so well in the exhibition season that the
Lakers stashed him on the injured list. Coach Phil Jackson said he
wouldn't hesitate to play Celestand immediately. And he will have
to _ Lue was averaging 18.3 minutes per game, and Bryant isn't due
back for at least a few more days.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's impressive,'' Jackson said of Celestand. ``He grew on me
as a player that plays some pretty good defense and starting
picking up the offensive things.''
</P>
<P>
   Lue said he's been bothered by tendinitis in his right knee for
three weeks but had been playing through the pain until it became
unbearable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got worse and worse. The last four games it got worse,''
said Lue, who was averaging 6.0 points and 2.1 assists. ``When I'm
sliding or trying to make a move, that's when it hurts the worst. .
. . It's hard when I bend to shoot. My teammates were saying they
can tell I'm dragging.''
</P>
<P>
   Lue will work with trainer Gary Vitti while he sits the
NBA-minimum five games, and the injury isn't expected to be a
long-term problem.
</P>
<P>
   __ Dribbles: Rookie swingman Devean George also was out of
action Monday after coming down with the flu. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said the Lakers are not interested in signing veteran
forward Armen Gilliam, waived Monday by the Orlando Magic.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he played the defense and rebounded like he plays offense
and posts up, I'd definitely be interested in Armen Gilliam,''
Jackson said. ``He's kind of converse to what we need. We need a
plugger in the lane and a we need a guy to rebound. At this point
he's a very interesting player with a lot of experience, but our
posts are pretty well covered by Shaquille (O'Neal).''

PORT AUTHORITY APPROVES FLAMINGO HILTON SALE TO STATION CASINOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Hilton Hotels Corp.
tried to make a clean break with Kansas City, but legally it must
keep one foot in town even after Station Casinos Inc. buys its
Flamingo Hilton Casino.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Kansas City Port Authority on Monday gave its approval for
the $22.5 million sale. The deal still needs the Missouri Gaming
Commission's endorsement. A meeting tentatively set for Wednesday
has been pushed back to Nov. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's unanimous vote permits Hilton essentially to sublease
its right to operate a riverboat casino on public land and allows
Station to fulfill all of Hilton's other obligations under a
development agreement with the city.
</P>
<P>
   However, because Hilton's $3 million in annual rent payments to
the city is the financial underpinning for more than $21 million in
Port Authority public improvement bonds sold years ago, Hilton
cannot just disappear unless those agreements are rewritten to
include Station and the bonds are resold. That's not likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hilton is going to remain liable to the Port Authority,'' Port
Authority Chairman Bill Johnson said Monday. ``In essence, we have
strengthened our hand'' by adding Station as a lessee.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the bond proceeds helped pay for the
construction of Richard L. Brkley Riverfront Park on land west of
the casino site.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of both gambling companies were on hand Monday.
Hilton attorney Jerry Riffel said that because of the bond
agreements, it was difficult legally for Hilton to just walk away,
which it wanted to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy with the Port Authority's requirements,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Station now will press the Gaming Commission for a quick
approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``This needs to get done by the end of the year,'' said Troy
Stremming, Station's Midwest counsel. Station had hoped to close
the Hilton deal by Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   An Illinois-based group that issued a late bid to buy the
Flamingo has appealed to the Gaming Commission to reject the sale
to Station on grounds that the company would control about half of
the Kansas City gambling market.
</P>
<P>
   The group made no public appeals to the Port Authority for its
support.
</P>
<P>
   Documents made public Monday disclosed that Station's Missouri
subsidiary that would operate the Flamingo would be a limited
liability corporation called Front Street Station.
</P>
<P>
   However, John V. Finamore, Station's Midwest president, said the
casino itself would operate under a different name. Finamore said
he would disclose Station's redevelopment plans and the new name in
coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Other documents disclosed that Hilton's gravel valet parking lot
was in violation of city codes. It wasn't clear who will have to
pave the lot and bring it into compliance.
</P>
<P>
   The Port Authority on Monday also approved new terms for a 1996
agreement that spells out how Station is to involve minorities and
women in purchasing and ownership matters.
</P>
<P>
   Since it opened in January 1997, Station has met authority
quotas for hiring women and minorities. But both Station and the
Flamingo have fallen short of similar goals for buying goods and
services from minority- and women-owned businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The new agreement, pushed hard by the Black Chamber of Commerce
of Greater Kansas City, applies to both casinos. It calls for about
35 percent of the casinos' purchases to be from disadvantaged
firms.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Mabin, Black Chamber president, was cautiously optimistic
after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're better off than we were two months ago,'' he said. ``If
we can continue to build relationships with Station and get some
better monitoring and enforcement from the Port Authority, it could
work. ... We want to see greater opportunities for minority-owned
business.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also calls for 10 percent minority participation
in the ownership of the Front Street Station corporation and a
Missouri subsidiary that owns Station Casino Kansas City.

1954 CHAMPIONSHIP TEAM WAS BRUINS' BEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ The players congregated outside the Men's Gym and
gazed at the fading September sun. Some sat on the railing, some on
the warm concrete. It was 1954, the first day of practice, yet they
were consumed by an emptiness that had lingered for nearly a year.
</P>
<P>
   They talked about the previous season _ about the promising
start and disappointing end, about blowing a 20-0 lead to Stanford
and a 14-0 lead to Michigan State in the Rose Bowl. What went
wrong? How could they avoid a recurrence?
</P>
<P>
   They talked about coach Henry ``Red'' Sanders and his resolve
that first day of training camp. He, too, felt the emptiness; they
could see it in his eyes and hear it in his voice. They talked
about a job unfinished, about a conference to conquer and history
to make.
</P>
<P>
   It was group therapy in sweat and shoulder pads, and as the sun
faded into the Pacific and UCLA's campus grew quiet, their angst
slowly disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget the feeling that was generated in that
conversation,'' guard Sam Boghosian said recently. ``We knew we
were going to be a team of destiny. We knew we were going to be
something special.''
</P>
<P>
   They'd be much more than that.
</P>
<P>
   They would be a team for the ages.
</P>
<P>
   ++++
</P>
<P>
   Which is the greatest UCLA team of the 1900s?
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, behind future Heisman Trophy quarterback Gary Beban,
the Bruins beat No. 1 Michigan State in the Rose Bowl and finished
the season ranked fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Donahue's 1982 gang was 10-1-1, beat Michigan in the Rose
Bowl and also finished fifth.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, UCLA won 10 games and produced two dozen NFL draft
picks, including Troy Aikman, Carnell Lake and Ken Norton Jr. As
talent goes, the '87 team stands alone.
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, quarterback Cade McNown led the Bruins to 20
consecutive wins, two Pac-10 titles, a Cotton Bowl victory and
back-to-back top-10 finishes. The 1997-'98 Bruins were as close to
offensive perfection as the school has ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the best UCLA team of them all did not win 10 games, it did
not produce a first-round draft choice or Heisman Trophy candidate,
and it did not play in the Rose Bowl because of the league's
no-repeat rule.
</P>
<P>
   All the 1954 team did was finish 9-0 and win the school's only
national championship. (UCLA finished atop the coaches' UPI poll,
Ohio State atop the writers' and broadcasters' AP poll, kicking up
a big controversy.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly the best I've seen,'' said UCLA athletic
director Peter Dalis, who has seen every team for 45 years. ``What
I remember most was how physical they were and that they had a lot
of speed, even by today's standards. Just the way they dominated _
nobody could move the ball on them.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1954 Bruins are one of the best teams in conference history
_ as dominant in their time as the great USC squads and Washington
'91 were in theirs. The proof is in the numbers: The '54 Bruins
have the highest scoring differential (36.4) of the conference's
seven national champions.
</P>
<P>
   Behind two-way All-Americans Jim Salsbury (guard), Jack Ellena
(tackle) and Bob Davenport (fullback/defensive back), the Bruins
led the nation in scoring offense (40.8 points per game) AND
scoring defense (4.4).
</P>
<P>
   In consecutive weeks, they beat Stanford 72-0 and Oregon State
61-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``UCLA's only weakness is that the Bruin third team is not quite
as strong as the first team,'' Oregon State coach Kip Taylor
quipped.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were so good they won every coin flip, took the ball
every time, and scored on their first drive in eight of nine games.
They were so good they shut out four of their last five opponents,
including USC, which rushed for 5 yards in a 34-0 loss.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Trojans coach Jess Hill visited UCLA's locker
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``UCLA is the best club we've played,'' Hill said. ``They're No.
1 in the nation as far as I'm concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   +++++
</P>
<P>
   Sanders would not let them be anything less. If their focus
faltered, if they took success for granted, if they slacked for a
second in practice or a game, he intervened with an unforgettable
glance or blistering comment. After guiding the Bruins to a 16-3
record the previous two seasons, Sanders knew the championship
window wouldn't stay open forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was as single-minded and focused, as committed, as I'd ever
seen,'' Boghosian said. ``He never, not for one second, let us
forget what happened in the Stanford game in '53. He was hell bent
on not letting us a lose a game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins used the single-wing offense, which positioned the
tailback (Primo Villaneuva) 5 yards behind the center, as a shotgun
quarterback is today. He'd either pass to the ends, run behind the
dominating offensive line or hand the ball to wingback Jim Decker.
Sometimes, the Bruins would snap the ball directly to Davenport,
the fullback, who was stationed next to Villaneuva. The
quarterback, Terry Debay, was a blocker.
</P>
<P>
   It worked well. UCLA led the conference with 286.4 rushing yards
per game, a mark that stood for 18 years, and its average of 40.8
points was the highest total in the nation in six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very deceptive offense,'' said assistant Bill Barnes,
who coached the ends and tackles that year. ``People would look at
it and think it's very plain. But when you snap to the fullback,
and he pitches to the wingback, and he pitches it to the end on a
reverse, it's hard to stop. We were the only team that used it out
west.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins opened the season with a 67-0 victory over the San
Diego Naval Training Center, setting a school scoring record that
would last a month. They only had two close games that year: a 12-7
victory over No. 4 Maryland and a 21-20 escape at Washington in
which the second-half demons returned.
</P>
<P>
   Leading 21-0, the Bruins fumbled two punts and watched the
Huskies score 20 consecutive points before UCLA's defense sealed
the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``That game saved the season,'' Ellena said. ``The next week, we
played Stanford and it was the quietest week of practice of the
season. There was no rah-rah. It was like each man had his own
vendetta because of what had happened in '53.''
</P>
<P>
   Including Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I remember correctly,'' Boghosian said, ``Red had a
master's degree in English. I know you can't print his pregame
speech.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA rushed for 418 yards and intercepted eight Stanford passes
in the 72-0 victory. A few hours later, Ellena was married in the
Westwood Christian Church, then everyone got back to work.
</P>
<P>
   With history in the crosshairs, the Bruins outscored their last
five opponents 235-6.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Former UCLA coach) Tommy Prothro always said you have to
compare teams within the era in which they played,'' Ellena said.
``You can't really compare our '54 team to USC in '72. The
equipment was different. The rules were different. The players are
bigger and faster today.
</P>
<P>
   ``But within our era, we were the best there was. It was really
a magical season.'' &QL;

SUIT SAYS IMMIGRATION SERVICE UNDERCUT HONDURAN AID EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Vt.)  (mk) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lawyers accused the Immigration and Naturalization
Service on Monday of undermining a federal program that offers work
permits to Honduran immigrants so they can help relatives at home
recover from the devastation of Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   In a class-action lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in
Brooklyn, four immigrant advocacy groups said the agency's
processing center in Vermont had failed to provide short-term work
permits to thousands of Hondurans who have been entitled to them
for months.
</P>
<P>
   In early January, Hondurans living in the United States were
offered the chance to apply for temporary protected status under a
law that protects some foreign nationals from deportation when
their home country has been devastated by armed conflict or a
natural disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Mitch struck Honduras and other parts of Central
America in October and November 1998. The immigration service
immediately announced that it would suspend deportations to the
affected countries as a humanitarian gesture; when the full extent
of the damage became clear, Attorney General Janet Reno expanded
the gesture with the offer of temporary protected status.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Honduran immigrants said Monday that officials
in Vermont had improperly demanded documentation from immigrants
that was not legally required for temporary protected status,
further delaying the issuance of permits. The program for Hondurans
is set to expire on July 5, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials in Washington acknowledged Monday that
there had been problems in processing some applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, there was a misunderstanding or misconception on the
part of the Vermont Service Center,'' said Bill Strassberger, an
INS spokesman. ``Their understanding of the regulations was that
there was more documentation required than actually was necessary.
That's now been clarified and we are working to get the
applications processed.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit and the official response underscored recurrent
problems at the Vermont center, which handles immigration cases
from states along the East Coast from Maine to Virginia. Applicants
for citizenship and for green cards have waited as long as three
years _ longer than in other regions _ for the Vermont center to
locate and then process their requests. Its handling of the
Honduran program has drawn criticism from immigration lawyers for
months.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 107,000 Hondurans nationwide applied for the benefit by
the August deadline, and nearly 70,000 had received a work permit
as of the first week of November, according to the agency.
</P>
<P>
   However, of the nearly 36,000 requests for work permits received
at the Vermont center, 21,000 were sent back with a demand for more
information. No other service center in the country raised
questions about so many applications.
</P>
<P>
   To receive the legal right to live and work in the United States
while their country is rebuilding, Hondurans had to show they had
resided in the United States since Dec. 30, 1998, and had not
traveled outside the country since Jan. 5, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But many applicants to the Vermont center received letters
telling them they had to prove, instead, that they had resided in
the country before Dec. 30, 1998. Some were told they had to prove
they had not traveled outside the United States since the day they
had arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Not only were the demands illegal, the lawsuit charges, but the
agency ignored a legal obligation to issue temporary permits so
that applicants could get jobs while their files were being
processed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Temporary protected status is nothing new _ it has been used
with dozens of countries,'' said Charles Wheeler, a lawyer at the
Catholic Legal Immigration Network in San Francisco. ``The INS has
never requested this level of documentation.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Hondurans who applied for the temporary protected
status are in the country illegally, immigrant advocates said. They
may be unemployed or working at black-market jobs for low wages. A
work permit, even a temporary one, would give these Hondurans a
chance to earn more and send more to their families, Wheeler said.

   &QL; 
``MY MOVIE BUSINESS'' &QL; 
By John Irving (Random House, $19.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, New &AMP; Notable has had occasion to talk with a
number of good writers whose books have been made into movies,
including Alice Walker (``The Color Purple''), Michael Ondaatje
(``The English Patient''), Sue Miller (``The Good Mother''),
Russell Banks (``The Sweet Hereafter''), Anna Quindlen (``One True
Thing'') and David Guterson (``Snow Falling on Cedars''). Almost
without exception, the happiest among them were those who had
relinquished control, who recognized from the start that they were
writers of novels, not screenplays. They took the money, handed
over their books and waited to see what came of it. Over the years,
John Irving has chosen a different path. He declined to write the
screenplay for ``The World According to Garp,''but he was involved
enough in the filmmaking process to rankle under the changes that
Steve Tesich made in his novel. He also declined to write the
screenplay for ``The Hotel New Hampshire,'' then watched as Tony
Richardson made a farcical exaggeration of the book. Irving did not
decline to write a screenplay for ``The Cider House Rules.'' In
fact, he wrote many of them, draft after draft for director after
director. Over the course of 13 years, he worked with four
directors and wrote so many versions of the script that he learned
how to do it right. His first draft, written when he still believed
a film should be true to a novel, would have made a nine-hour
movie. The final script whittled a 500-page novel down to 136
pages. By that time, Irving knew that ``a screenplay, as a piece of
writing, is merely the scaffolding for a building someone else is
going to build.'' This memoir of his moviemaking experiences is
unabashedly self-indulgent, a chance for Irving to talk about his
novels, his children and friends, his grandfather (whose work as an
obstetrician influenced the story of ``Cider House'') and his
success. It's also a chance to plug the movie, which is set to open
here next month. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``THE ART OF THE STORY'' &QL; 
Edited by Daniel Halpern (Viking, $40) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This international anthology of contemporary short stories
includes work from 78 contributors from 35 countries. All of the
writers were born from 1938 to 1970 and were chosen by Halpern to
represent a greater sensitivity to popular culture than those
included in his earlier volume, ``The Art of the Tale.'' These
stories, he says, are ``less in `the classical mode' and more
reactive to the media in all its venues. These younger writers have
distanced themselves _ sometimes subtly, sometimes less so _ from
the influential writers practicing during the first two or three
decades of the 20th century.'' Raymond Carver just made the cut, as
did Margaret Atwood, Richard Bausch, Ian McEwan, Joyce Carol Oates,
Amos Oz, Kenya's Ngugi Wa Thiong O (EDITORS: how it's listed at
amazon.com ) and Argentina's Luisa Valenzuela. Among the younger
writers are Lorrie Moore, Ben Okri, Salman Rushdie, Bobbie Ann
Mason, Tobias Wolff, Barry Hannah, James Kelman, Richard Ford,
Deborah Eisenberg, Banana Yoshimoto, Martin Amis, Turkey's Murathan
Mungan, Ghana's Ama Ata Aidoo and Lebanon's Hanan Al-Shaykh. Also
here are writers from Cuba, Nigeria, Martinique, India, Haiti,
Vietnam, Russia, Hungary, Somalia, Uruguay, France, Tanzania,
Poland, Scandinavia, South Africa and China. &QL; 
``ENCHANTED NIGHT'' &QL; 
By Steven Millhauser (Crown, $17) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the night of revelation. This is the night the dolls
wake. This is the night of the dreamer in the attic. This is the
night of the piper in the woods.'' This passage is a sign of
ethereal things to come. Millhauser, who won a Pulitzer Prize for
``Martin Dressler,'' has written an otherworldly story in brief
passages that portray people in a Connecticut town one hot summer
night. There is Havershaw, a 39-year-old man who lives in the attic
of his mother's house and struggles to find some justification for
his life. There are ``the outlaws,'' a gang of teenage girls who
break into houses and steal unimportant things (refrigerator
magnets, toothbrushes), always leaving behind the same note _ ``We
Are Your Daughters.'' There is Janet Manning, a young woman with
sensuous thoughts of the handsome stranger she met on the beach
that day, and William Cooper, a young man with a crush on a lovely
mannequin in the window of a department store (a mannequin that
will, on this magical night, come to life). And all across town,
the old, forgotten dolls stored in attics begin to wake up and
shake their dusty limbs. Some town, huh? Millhauser's dreamlike
tale _ a mere 109 pages long _ is grounded in the familiar longing
of his characters and played out under a big, white moon on an
enchanted summer night. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``FRONTIER CHILDREN'' &QL; 
By Linda Peavy and Ursula Smith (Oklahoma, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nothing was sadder to see than the graves of children who died
along the westward trail as their families traveled with the wagon
trains of the mid-1800s. And nothing was more triumphant than news
of children who made the journey and began a new life. Peavy and
Smith, whose previous collaborations were ``Pioneer Women'' and
``Women in Waiting in the Westward Movement,'' offer a clear-eyed
view of what frontier life was like for youngsters of Chinese,
Hispanic, Native American, African-American and European
backgrounds. Because the experiences of these children were largely
undocumented, the authors have relied on stories handed from one
generation to another, the few existing letters and diaries written
by frontier children, journals kept by explorers and missionaries,
and, most important, photographs. Their text is accompanied by 206
black-and-white images, and some of them will break your heart. &QL;

EDITORIAL: MRS. CLINTON'S MISSTEPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Nov. 16:
</P>
<P>
   Many a candidate in New York has tripped over the hazardous
emotional terrain of Israel and the Middle East peace process.
Hillary Rodham Clinton faces a special problem in addressing the
subject because of her confusing roles as first lady,
administration defender and undeclared Senate candidate. The
difficulty cropped up in a different area over the summer when she
first endorsed and then opposed President Clinton's pardon of
several Puerto Rican nationalists. Last week it emerged again with
her handling of the subject of Israel's treatment of the
Palestinians, an issue that drew fire from her presumed opponent,
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. The electorate will have plenty of
opportunities to weigh such political exchanges. For now, Mrs.
Clinton needs to move quickly to clarify her views on Israel to
voters who seem perplexed about where she stands.
</P>
<P>
   The furor over Mrs. Clinton's trip was sparked by her visit to
the West Bank city of Ramallah, where Suha Arafat, the wife of
Yasser Arafat, used a joint appearance with her to attack past
Israeli policies toward the Palestinians, including what she
alleged was the use of toxic gas on civilians. Mrs. Clinton's
advisers said the simultaneous translation at the meeting had not
made it clear that Mrs. Arafat was doing anything more than making
a routine comment about past grievances. A more adroit diplomat,
however, might have been alert to the highly charged atmosphere and
weighed in with something distancing herself from the comment. Mrs.
Clinton did not do so until that night, after the controversy was
in full boil.
</P>
<P>
   More important to voters than the tactical clumsiness are her
substantive positions on Israel, the Palestine Liberation
Organization and the Mideast peace process. She has sown
uncertainty with past comments endorsing a Palestinian state and
later supporting the idea of Jerusalem as Israel's capital, a
position the White House says can be settled only by the peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Mrs. Clinton's problems may be sorted out when she gets
a campaign manager and a larger staff to handle the policy issues
that any Senate candidate needs when running.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate race is sure to have its ups and downs for both
sides. But in order to mount a competitive campaign, Mrs. Clinton
has to reassure New Yorkers that reversals and vacillations are the
errors of a novice candidate, rather than typical of her approach
to foreign policy. Since she is running on her own, she needs to
project a consistent vision that is separate from the
administration that will pass from the scene at the end of next
year. &QL;

 Huskies QB Tuiasosopo takes blame better praise  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In the land of faltering Northwest stock prices, do
not include Marques Tuiasosopo with the Microsofts, the Boeings or
the Amazon.coms. His stock remains solid, if only because
Tuiasosopo is such a solid citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, when Washington's junior quarterback set an
NCAA record by passing for 302 yards and rushing for 207 in leading
the Huskies to a made-for-TV, Pac-10 victory over league-leading
Stanford, Tuiasosopo refused to accept praise for founding the
``300/200'' club.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for any of us who have watched even a bit of big-time
sports in the last few years, when stars just can't lay off the
urge to self-aggrandize, it really merits repeating what ``Tui''
did:
</P>
<P>
   He refused to take credit.
</P>
<P>
   He denied himself even a whiff of pleasure in acknowledging that
maybe, just maybe, his amazing performance was due to his personal
brand of warrior-like competitiveness _ especially since that
particular Saturday Tui was working with sore hindquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Mind-boggling.
</P>
<P>
   Which leads us to the Tuiasosopo found Monday on the UW campus _
the dark-haired, wonderfully mannered, look-you-in-the-eye kind of
college player eating a monstrous helping of lasagna.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hungry,'' Tuiasosopo said, head bent over his plate while
admitting he had slept through breakfast and needed to make up lost
calories.
</P>
<P>
   And that wasn't the only thing he wants to make up for.
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday, after a string of victories over California,
Stanford and Arizona that gave the Huskies a 5-1 conference record,
Tuiasosopo made a fifth appearance on regional TV _ in the Rose
Bowl of all places _ and came up looking much more human than he
had in weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, as he mastered the option and earned calls from ABC
football announcers as the early favorite for the 2000 Heisman
Trophy, Tuiasosopo was gaining stature of almost mythic proportions
_ and it seemed perfectly appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   The TV camera would show Tui walking calmly to the line, calling
for the snap just as the play clock ticked down to zero, faking a
handoff and then breaking off a 17-yard run.
</P>
<P>
   In the stands, the camera would then find Tui's father, Manu
Tuiasosopo, the former Seahawk who lives and dies with every play _
especially since it became excitingly clear that as Tuiasosopo
goes, so go the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   To say that the Huskies lost to the UCLA Bruins because
Tuiasosopo could not raise his level of play and take along his
entire Husky team _ as he seems to have done most all season _
would seem unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Unless, of course, you asked Tui about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take full responsibility for the offensive part of it,''
Tuiasosopo said Monday, still trying to digest the loss and the
Rose Bowl implications and, most important, his team's psyche
heading into the regular-season finale against Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   ``As quarterback, you've got to make decisions and get the ball
into people's hands,'' Tuiasosopo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't on the field much in the second half, and as
quarterback, I take responsibility for that. A lot of what goes on
in the offense is directed by the quarterback. That's why it kills
me so much. We weren't able to stay on the ball. We weren't able to
keep the defense rested and put points on the board and let the
defense come out and fly around and hit people and have fun,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In overtime, we had a couple of chances to score, and that
didn't happen. Then I wound up ending it with an interception. I
just didn't get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 48 hours, Tuiasosopo said he has spent a ton of
time going over what happened against the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah, man. This was worse than any other weekend. There
were so many plays I'd like to have back,'' he said, reeling
through them.
</P>
<P>
   Well, there isn't anyone in the state of Washington, except for
Cougar fans, who doesn't empathize with Tuiasosopo for his
anguished mental playback over missed opportunities last Saturday
in a game the Huskies wanted, needed, could have had.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, there isn't anyone who has not watched the Huskies
this supposed-to-be-low-expectation season and not born witness to
the surprisingly wondrous emergence of Washington's option offense,
led by Tui.
</P>
<P>
   The Rose Bowl dream was a heck of a lot of fun this past week.
But Tuiasosopo vows he is not done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been raised to be competitive. I always want to be the
best. I want a team I play with to be the best. I want the guys to
be the best,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Way back when I started playing sports, my dad asked me if I
wanted to play sports for fun or if I wanted to play to play. I
said I want to play to play. I want to do it. Ever since then,
winning is the best feeling the world, especially in a team game,
and that's what's important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose Bowl or no Rose Bowl, Tuiasosopo has done his job this
season. And Rose Bowl or no Rose Bowl, there is still a reason to
anticipate what he does this Apple Cup Saturday.

RANGERS TALKING TO ZEILE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Texas Rangers could be getting close to
re-signing third baseman Todd Zeile. The process with pitcher Aaron
Sele could take longer.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have exchanged proposals with Zeile's agent, Seth
Levinson, and Zeile said they should know soon if a deal can be
reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm optimistic we're going to try and do everything we can get
to get it done,'' Zeile said. ``As I said before, I enjoyed my stay
in Texas, it was the best baseball experience I've ever had, and my
first priority is to try and get something done with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers general manager Doug Melvin said he spoke Monday with
Levinson and ``we'll continue to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal could be complicated by the Los Angeles Dodgers'
situation with third baseman Adrian Beltre. His agent, Scott Boras,
has filed a grievance asking Beltre be declared a free agent,
claiming the Dodgers signed him at age 15. Earlier this year, the
Dodgers lost two Cuban players because they signed before they were
16.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile could be interested in returning to the Dodgers because he
and his family make their permanent home in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something came up with the Dodgers, I'd certainly have to
give it consideration,'' Zeile said. ``But at this time I'm a
realist, and, looking at it more from the skeptic side of things,
it's hard to consider an opportunity lcc &QR; uhat until it comes to
fruition.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin also met with Sele's agent, Adam Katz, Monday and made a
formal offer. Melvin declined to reveal the offer but admitted the
process is only beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked, and we're going to continue to talk,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Katz was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin said he would like to get something done quickly but
added: ``Among free agents, I see a reluctance for people to sign.
I think they want to wait until somebody makes a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Two possible benchmarks for Sele's contract are the four-year,
$32 million contract that Todd Stottlemyre signed with Arizona last
year and the three-year, $24 million contract Darryl Kile signed
with Colorado two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But much depends on the demand. Several clubs have reportedly
expressed interest in Sele, most notably Seattle and Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there will be competition,'' Melvin said. ``There are
enough teams looking for pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Much also depends on other free-agent starting pitchers,
including David Cone, Kenny Rogers, Chuck Finley and Darren Oliver.
The Rangers are interested in all four, and Melvin is not waiting
on Sele.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've touched base with some of the other free-agent
pitchers,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin hasn't ruled out trading for more starting pitching.
Several starters are available, including Kile, Los Angeles' Ismael
Valdes and Darren Dreifort, Tampa Bay's Wilson Alvarez and Rolando
Arrojo, and Toronto's David Wells.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking at the possibility of a trade, but the problem is
giving up players we want to put on our team,'' Melvin said. nn

STARS SEARCHING FOR SOME POWERFUL MEDICINE
</HEADLINE>
 PLAY-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Doctor, the Stars have a problem.
</P>
<P>
   What's the problem?
</P>
<P>
   Well, they don't exactly know.
</P>
<P>
   What are the symptoms?
</P>
<P>
   They're coughing up power-play opportunities, 3-for-24 with a
man advantage in their past seven games despite plenty of good
chances. Think about what a power-play goal here or there could
have done; four of their past seven losses have come by two goals
or less.
</P>
<P>
   Can you prescribe anything, doc?
</P>
<P>
   Well, nine out of 10 doctors agree, score one or two goals, and
they'll feel better in the morning. The Stars have scored a
power-play goal in each of their past two victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all it's going to take,'' Stars winger Brett Hull
agreed, ``a fluky goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting that power-play-stoking goal has proven to be harder
than skipping through flu season unaffected, and has left Stars
players and coaches in search of alternate remedies.
</P>
<P>
   Wear teams down, Stars defenseman Sergei Zubov suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Become multidimensional, Stars coach Ken Hitchcock recommended.
</P>
<P>
   Be patient, Stars defenseman Darryl Sydor said, because sooner
or later a unit featuring Hull, Mike Modano and Joe Nieuwendyk at
forward is bound to score. That's why Hitchcock has decided to play
them together as an even-strength line against Washington on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always find when you put good players together success
happens because they work at it and stay with it,'' Hitchcock said.
``I find it doesn't work when they expect it to happen easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like he's talking about the Stars' power-play problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``A little bit,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock isn't a doctor, but he has spent a good portion of
this season trying to heal what ails their aching power play.
</P>
<P>
   His studies have, at least, pinpointed one problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are one-dimensional,'' Hitchcock said. ``You have to be
multidimensional on the power play. I really think that the power
play has to start relying on five guys individually rather than
Hull to shoot the puck and Zubie to pass it. I think you have to
have more than one threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Zubov needs to pepper the goalie with shots when left alone
at the point. Hull needs to find open teammates when defenders
crash in to try to prevent his less-than-secret slap shot from the
circle.
</P>
<P>
   Modano, Nieuwendyk and Sydor need to get jump-started because
the Stars know what those power plays can do for them. Last season,
the Stars converted 18.8 percent of their regular-season power
plays; the same numbers would rank them ninth in the NHL this
season instead of 21st, where they currently are.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something last year that put us over the edge a lot in
games,'' Modano said. ``The first four months, it was clicking at a
good rate, and it won a lot of games for us. It gave a lot of guys
confidence and the team confidence that when we were on it there
was a good chance we'd score on the majority of our opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it's been struggling, and our team has been
struggling scoring (even-strength) goals. It kind of goes hand in
hand, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   The Modano-Nieuwendyk-Hull line provides a remedy to that
problem as well as a few others.
</P>
<P>
   Modano and Hull have been looking for a linemate while Jere
Lehtinen recovers from a fractured ankle. Nieuwendyk has been
looking for a line since rookie Roman Lyashenko took his spot
centering the Stars' second line.
</P>
<P>
   So necessity and curiosity prompted Hitchcock to create his
paycheck line, bringing together players that have combined for 15
goals and 20 assists this season. They certainly have the tools to
generate more scoring for a team that has averaged slightly more
than two goals a game this season. They can handle the puck, shoot
and skate, all at high speeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of good lines in the league can do those
things,'' Modano said. ``You get other teams thinking about who
they are going to check, chances are good.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock's only concern is that the Stars' struggle to turn
skill into points on the power play might be contagious, and he
can't afford to have his top line ailing just as his power play
looks to be close to finding a cure.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel it getting better and better,'' Zubov said. ``We're
getting chances. Now, we have to get a goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Just what the doctor ordered. nn

AMAZING GALLOWAY SPARKS SEAHAWKS' GREAT ESCAPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ His stat line in the newspaper Monday made it
look like just another game for Joey Galloway: 4 catches, 88 yards,
0 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   In his first four seasons with the Seahawks, the mercurial
Galloway had 26 games where he caught more passes, 19 games where
he had more receiving yards and 27 games with at least one scoring
catch.
</P>
<P>
   But what Galloway did at the Kingdome Sunday was closer to the
extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   One week removed from playing flag football in Ohio, six days
after ending his 101-day holdout and with only three practices
under his belt, Galloway made plays that helped his team escape
with a 20-17 victory over the Denver Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what to expect,'' he said Monday. ``But I think
it worked out pretty well for me from the standpoint of getting in
there and getting my feet wet.''
</P>
<P>
   Wet feet? Galloway's up-to-his-armpits effort was a life
preserver in a game where it appeared the Seahawks had gone into
the tank in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Or as running back Ricky Watters said after the victory that
pushed the team's division-leading record to 7-2, ``We couldn't
have won it without him.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of Galloway's catches was better than the last. Each helped
turn jeers from the sold-out Kingdome crowd into cheers. Each meant
more to the team, as it struggled to overcome the Broncos' 17-10
lead.
</P>
<P>
   He opened with a modest 6-yarder on the Seahawks' opening drive
that ended with a field goal. Nothing special, except that it was
his first reception in a game since the season finale at Denver
last Dec. 27.
</P>
<P>
   He added a 15-yarder for a first down later in the quarter on
the drive to the Seahawks' first touchdown. A nice catch after
running a crisp route, but just a prelude.
</P>
<P>
   With the Seahawks facing a second-and-20 at the end of the third
quarter, and trailing by a touchdown, Jon Kitna lofted a pass along
the sideline. Broncos cornerback Dale Carter figured Galloway would
have to catch it out of bounds, if at all. But Galloway controlled
the ball and got both feet down for a 39-yard completion. Broncos
coach Mike Shanahan challenged the official's call, but it was
upheld after being reviewed. Four plays later, Todd Peterson kicked
a field goal to trim the Broncos' lead to 17-13.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on a first-down play from the Denver 48, Kitna went to
Galloway with a pass that was slightly behind him as he crossed the
middle of the field. Galloway leaped, reached back and made the
grab for a 28-yard gain. Two plays later, Kitna passed 20 yards to
Sean Dawkins for what would be the game-winning touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a guy not having training camp and catching a lot of
passes, those were tough catches,'' coach Mike Holmgren said of
Galloway's final two receptions. ``I think if he had not caught
either ball, people would say, `Well, that was a tough catch.
That's understandable under the best of circumstances.' So that was
pretty impressive, really.''
</P>
<P>
   Big plays made even bigger because of when Galloway made them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big, big, big,'' offered cornerback Shawn Springs, who also
was a teammate of Galloway at Ohio State. ``You just expect that
stuff from Joey.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Holmgren feared was Galloway getting injured if he was
rushed into the lineup too early. Galloway did take some hits
Sunday night, but wasn't showing any ill effects Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a lot better than I thought I would,'' he said. ``I did
take a couple (of hits), but I've been stretching every day with
Kent (Johnston, the strength and conditioning coach). As long as I
keep that up, then I think my body will hold up.''
</P>
<P>
   The next step for Galloway is to become more immersed in the
offense. He played 22 snaps against the Broncos and Holmgren
estimated that number could increase by 10 this week when the
Seahawks play the Chiefs in Kansas City. Galloway also needs to
expand his grasp of the playbook. Sunday night, Holmgren had a
ready-list of 110 plays, but Galloway was involved in only 20.
</P>
<P>
   But Holmgren will not force Galloway on the offense at the
exclusion of Dawson, Derrick Mayes and Mike Pritchard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the tough part really is balancing that,'' Holmgren said,
``so they all get a chance to contribute and feel good about it.''

   FREDERICKSBURG, Texas _ Ken Hall doesn't hide his
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-six years after completing one of the most successful high
school football careers ever recorded, Hall sits in a corner of his
Fredericksburg restaurant talking about his playing days, his
barbecue and his desire to help teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   The latter prompts this show of disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   When one of his national records is broken, he says, he tries to
find that player's address and write him a letter of
congratulations. He has mailed off ``three or four'' of those
letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never heard back from any of them,'' Hall, 63, said with a
what-can-you-do shrug. ``Not a dang one. Which is surprising.''
</P>
<P>
   Much has changed since ``The Sugar Land Express'' dominated
Texas schoolboy football in the early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Try to find a team running the vaunted ``Notre Dame Box''
offense employed by those Sugar Land Gators. (It was a variant of
the single-wing). Try to find Sugar Land High School, for that
matter. (It consolidated with Missouri City in 1959 to form the
Fort Bend school district.) Or the Gators' trophies from their
three Class B regional championship seasons. (Hall doesn't even
know where they are.)
</P>
<P>
   But if you want to find the star of that era, all you have to do
is head south of downtown Fredericksburg on U.S. 87 toward San
Antonio. ``Ken Hall and Company'' will be down on the left, not far
from the high school football field. And there's a good chance Hall
and wife Gloria, his high school sweetheart, will be there.
</P>
<P>
   They still come from miles around to meet the man who two
generations ago every true Texas high school football fan followed
like a recent visitor who waited in the Sulphur Springs Cafe for
newspaper accounts on Monday mornings.
</P>
<P>
   They still come from miles around to meet The Sugar Land
Express, the man whose records dwarf the legends of Earl Campbell,
Billy Sims and Eric Dickerson, even if his fame doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   [ITAL]11,232 career rushing yards. 4,045 yards rushing in 1953.
3,458 yards rushing in 1952. 3,160 yards rushing in 1951.[END ITAL]
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are overwhelming. At some point during the listing
of Hall's career statistics, the ``Wows'' give way to simple head
shakes.
</P>
<P>
   The National Federation of State High School Associations'
record book credits Hall with setting 17 national offensive
records. Five still stand. Then consider that Hall missed a lot of
second halves of games because of lopsided scores. Or that there
are no statistics for his returns of kickoffs, punts and
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   He is, without question, one of the greatest high school
football players to come from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He set a standard that all high school running backs are
trying to reach,'' said Dave Campbell, a retired sportswriter and
founder and editor-in-chief of ``Dave Campbell's Texas Football''
magazine. ``He certainly would have to rank with the great high
school running backs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The'' standard is the career rushing yardage record, the one
Hall says most people bring up first. No one has come within 2,000
yards of Hall's mark of 11,232 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth on the all-time list is a running back from Pensacola
(Fla.) Escambia High School. His name? Emmitt Smith. In seventh
place is Rodney Thomas, the former Groveton and Texas A&AMP;M back who
plays for the Tennessee Titans. On down the list are names like
Billy Sims, David Overstreet and Terry Kirby.
</P>
<P>
   Those players' accomplishments after high school and the time
passed since Hall played are conspiring to make Hall one of Texas'
lesser-known legends.
</P>
<P>
   Hall says most of the people he hears from are his age or
children of father's his age who were told of his feats.
</P>
<P>
   Missing from that group is today's generation of high school
football players.
</P>
<P>
   ``As time passes, things fade,'' said Austin Westlake coach Ron
Schroeder, who said it was ``a special treat'' when he met Hall for
the first time in August. ``Just like you might say `Roy Rogers' to
this generation, and they don't know who you're talking about.''
[ITAL]14,558 career yards of total offense. 5,146 total yards and
428.8 total yards per game in 1953.[END ITAL]
</P>
<P>
   The road most traveled is to turn Ken Hall into a history
lesson, to measure his accomplishments with yard lines. But that's
The Sugar Land Express. Ken Hall was made when the yards didn't
come so easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ups and downs he had in his career,'' said Fredericksburg
football coach Jerald Klett, ``is what makes him such an
influential individual.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Sugar Land as a 6-foot-1, 200-pound
bruising speedster in 1954, Hall went to Texas A&AMP;M to play for
first-year coach Paul ``Bear'' Bryant. But Hall and Bryant had
their problems.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Hall calls it a ``chemistry'' problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``A young coach with a job to do. A young kid with talent and
who knew how to run the ball,'' Hall said. ``Sometimes two goods
don't make a right. And perhaps that's what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall left A&AMP;M in the spring of 1956. You won't find Hall's name
on the A&AMP;M media guide's list of letterwinners. (Although you will
find it under Aggies in the professional draft, all-time Aggies
professionals and Aggies in the Texas Sports Hall of Fame.)
</P>
<P>
   Hall played two seasons for Edmonton of the Canadian Football
League because he had to wait until his college class graduated
before he could play professionally in the United States. In 1958,
while playing for the Baltimore Colts in an exhibition game, his
back was broken on a tackle by Sam Huff. He played the next season
for the Chicago Cardinals, played for the Houston Oilers in 1960
and with the Oilers and St. Louis Cardinals in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   He still holds Oilers/Titans franchise records for best kickoff
return average in a season (31.3) and longest kickoff return (104
yards). But he's not even the best-known Texas running back to play
for the Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't go on like, say, Earl Campbell and have a great
college career and have a great pro career,'' Dave Campbell said.
``If he had, he would have stamped his name more indelibly in
memory.''
[ITAL]899 career points. 395 total points and 32.9 points per game
in 1953.[END ITAL]
</P>
<P>
   Hall returned to the Houston area in 1962 to work for Imperial
Sugar in Sugar Land. In 1970, he, Gloria and sons Chuck and Mike
moved to California. In 1986, Hall returned to Texas. He was tired
of the corporate world. Barbecue, he decided, was what he really
wanted to do.
</P>
<P>
   Hall loves to talk about barbecue. When asked why he's in the
barbecue business, he responds with three one-word sentences:
``Passion. Love. Creativity.''
</P>
<P>
   But soon, his answer leads to teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This young man right here,'' Hall says, pointing to a
teen-ager cleaning up after another busy lunch session, ``and many
before him and several more now, I employ high school kids. And the
reason I do is that I feel like there are certain things that
they're not going to get in high school that they're going to learn
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can preempt that a little bit and bring them out here,
let them make a little money. They can help me. They can learn a
little something about discipline, how to get along with people,
how to work with other people, how to take rejection, how to
understand how it is to make a small living, and teach them how to
get along even with themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the kids that have ever worked here, at some time
almost every year, they'll come back and we'll stand out there and
hug for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Hall tells of two of his former employees. One, Hall would
wake up about once a week at 3 a.m. so he would get out of bed and
go to work. The second Hall got out of trouble one night, gave him
a lecture and took him to work. The pace in Hall's voice quickens
as he tells of how they would become successful in the business
world.
</P>
<P>
   Then he realizes he has ventured off the original subject of
barbecue. ``And there's a few more stories like that,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Hall remembers those stories better than his records.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're more important,'' he says.
[ITAL]127 career touchdowns. 57 total touchdowns and 4.8 touchdowns
per game in 1953.[END ITAL]
</P>
<P>
   You'll often find Hall doing something for teen-agers. He holds
an annual celebrity golf tournament that supports a $5,000 college
scholarship and a $2,000 scholarship for a vocational student.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been doing that three years and next year,'' he boasts,
``we will have eight kids in college. That's rewarding.''
</P>
<P>
   You'll also find him around Fredericksburg High School, although
he says he wants to stay out of the way because sometimes he can
``feel like I'm imposing.'' He does color commentary on radio
broadcasts of the Battlin' Billies football games. Last Thursday
night, he was helping cook at a pre-playoff game get-together.
</P>
<P>
   It's not so much the high school sports that Hall enjoys these
days as it is the kids who play them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's real involved in high school kids,'' Klett said. ``He
loves being around athletes. He's a great motivator. Having been
through the things he's been through, he kind of tells the kids how
it is. They look forward to seeing him.''
[ITAL]11 carries for 520 yards _ 47.3 yards per carry _ with seven
total touchdowns in a 1953 game vs. Houston Lutheran. 38 career
100-yard rushing games.[END ITAL]
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hall is in the second half of life. But unlike most of the
high school games he played in, he's not content to watch from the
sideline.
</P>
<P>
   He has considered that some of his records may still be around
when he no longer is.
</P>
<P>
   Even Westlake's Schroeder admitted that until this summer, he
``didn't know if he was still around. I just knew he existed as a
legend.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the accomplishments of the Sugar Land Express live on. And
so do the accomplishments of Ken Hall, but you won't find them in
any record books.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is those football accomplishments, a visitor to Hall's
restaurant tells him, for which he will mostly be remembered. Is
that OK with him?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' he said, then smiled. ``Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the kids can get something out of it, that's what it's all
about. I'm not sure they do.'' nn

JETS BEAT PATRIOTS, 24-17 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. _ It seems that no matter how good New England
gets, how much it dominates its division, or how many Pro Bowl
players adorn its roster like Christmas ornaments, when Bill
Parcells comes knocking on the door, the Patriots run into the
basement and hide. To them, Parcells is the bogyman.
</P>
<P>
   What else can explain such an inspiring performance by the New
York Jets against the Patriots on Monday night, leading to a 24-17
victory before a stunned crowd of 59,077 at Foxboro Stadium? What
else can explain Drew Bledsoe throwing three interceptions and
being outplayed by Ray Lucas? Or Curtis Martin blistering a good
run defense for 149 yards on 31 carries?
</P>
<P>
   New England did mount a furious comeback, scoring two
fourth-quarter touchdowns and putting a serious scare into the
Jets. But it was too late. In the end Parcells completely
outcoached Pete Carroll. As a result, New England, which had a
chance to take the lead in the American Football Conference East,
is fourth in the division at 6-3. The Jets, with a two-game winning
streak, are 3-6.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Ray did a pretty good job moving the team,''
Parcells said. ``He looked pretty good out there. Like I told the
team, even though we're 3-6, it's too soon to quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas, who had replaced Rick Mirer and was making his second
National Football League start, completed 18 of 31 passes for 153
yards, with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. Bledsoe, meanwhile,
was 15 for 36 passing for 170 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells's experiment involving Lucas paid off. The Patriots did
not know how to handle his athleticism and seemed shocked how
accurately he throws.
</P>
<P>
   Using a short, controlled passing game, lots of runs by Martin
up the gut and schemes that confused and pounded Bledsoe into
playing one of his worst games this year, an undermanned Jets team
scored 21 first-half points to New England's 3. The Jets had
averaged just 15.7 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' scoring drive in the second half was typical of the
way they used Lucas. It went a stunning 19 plays and lasted 11
minutes 23 seconds _ almost a full quarter. Lucas handed off to
Martin, sometimes ran the ball to the outside himself or threw to
Keyshawn Johnson for crucial first downs. The drive ended with
26-yard field goal by John Hall and gave the Jets a 24-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe, who had only four interceptions all season before
Monday night, finally led his team on a touchdown drive in the
fourth quarter. Running back Kevin Faulk caught a 13-yard pass to
cut the Jets' lead to 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   At this point Bledsoe and the Patriots woke up. When New England
got the ball back, Bledsoe threw a 31-yard touchdown pass to Troy
Brown with just under seven minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   But Bledsoe went back to his earlier form and was 1 of 9 passing
in the final minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets did suffer another blow when left tackle Jason Fabini
was lost for the season with a fourth-quarter knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the reasons that Parcells made the switch to Lucas were
obvious. Lucas provided athleticism to counter a good New England
rush. Parcells also likes the former Rutgers star.
</P>
<P>
   But there is an unspoken but equally powerful reason for the
change. Not only had Parcells lost confidence in Mirer, but Jets
players apparently had as well. Several of them said before the
game that they felt there was little chance for the offense to
perform well with Mirer at quarterback. Those are harsh words, but
not necessarily inaccurate. Though Lucas has been in the league a
far shorter time than Mirer has, it is Lucas who has a sort of
quiet cockiness.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells opened the game with an extremely conservative plan. On
the Jets' second offensive series, Martin carried the ball seven
straight times. On third-and-1, Lucas pitched the ball outside to
Martin for an 11-yard gain. But Parcells went to the well one too
many times when, on third-and-19, Martin went over left tackle for
just a 5-yard gain.
</P>
<P>
   What kept New York in the game was its defense. New England
seemed unprepared for the Jets' blitzing and coverage schemes as
the defensive coordinator Bill Belichick threw all kinds of
mind-numbing attacks at Bledsoe. The Patriots quarterback was
sacked twice in the first quarter, once by Marvin Jones (it was his
first sack of the season and first since 1997) and once by Roman
Phifer.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are Super Bowl contenders, but they often go
through dead spots in a game when they lose concentration and
almost sleepwalk. That is what was happening to the team early, and
the Jets took advantage. While New England had only 2 yards passing
after one quarter, the Jets had 70 yards rushing, mostly on
Martin's back.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the first half, New England was threatening to score,
but the Jets held the Patriots to a 22-yard field goal. Then Martin
scored again on a play up the middle from 36 yards out, and the
Jets were up, 14-3. They added another score after Bledsoe was
intercepted and the Jets converted that turnover into an 11-yard
touchdown from Lucas to tight end Fred Baxter.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets had established a tone for the game. They were on the
road. They were outgunned. But none of that seemed to matter.
Parcells was back in town, scaring his old team to death. &QL;

COWBOYS' ALLEN OUT AT LEAST TWO WEEKS WITH KNEE INJURY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Dallas Cowboys won a football game but lost
perhaps their ``best player by position in the NFL'' for a minimum
of two weeks, after magnetic resonance imaging results Monday
showed a sprain of All-Pro guard Larry Allen's right knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a sprain,'' Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said. ``We
were really pleased. He'll be out two to four weeks, hopefully
closer to two.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen, who had been playing at a ``Hall of Fame level,'' as
offensive line coach Hudson Houck said, sprained the medial
collateral ligament in his right knee in Sunday's 27-13 defeat of
Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough. Larry is the guy who makes it happen for us,''
Houck said. ``We'd really been coming around the last three
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past three weeks, the Cowboys have rushed for an average
of 4.0 (103 on 26 carries against Indianapolis), 8.5 (205 on 24
carries against Minnesota) and 4.4 (149 on 34 carries against Green
Bay) after averaging 3.5 yards in 200 rushes through the first six
games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had our offensive line intact for a few weeks in a
row,'' explained coach Chan Gailey, who was reminded by a reporter,
``Don't get used to that,'' referring to Allen's knee sprain in the
third quarter of Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get used to anything in this game,'' Gailey added
whimsically.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for the Cowboys is that in spite of their 5-4
record, they're in a three-way tie for first place in the NFC East.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that injuries to key players continue to mount.
Aside from Allen, the injuries include:
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Troy Aikman (concussion) was in Los Angeles on
Monday for further neurological testing. Gailey described the
chances of Aikman sitting out his second consecutive game as ``very
high.''
</P>
<P>
   Running back Emmitt Smith (broken right hand) will experiment
this week with a protective glove, similar to what was developed
for Tampa Bay defensive tackle Warren Sapp, who had a similar
injury. Gailey noted that Smith's chances are improved by the fact
that he carries the ball in his left hand and the fracture is to
the fourth metacarpal of his right hand. But the ``extra padding''
that could speed up his ability to play is strictly experimental at
this point.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Michael Irvin (cervical contusion/genetic
condition) continues to face a decision whether to retire, though
according to sources no decision has been reached yet. Jones said
he met with Irvin on Friday to talk about the Packers game. But
Jones said, ``we didn't talk about his future. I'm not aware of
anything right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback/punt returner Deion Sanders (strained right
hamstring/left groin) was on-again/off-again Sunday, playing when
perhaps he shouldn't, as the Packers failed to score on three plays
in which Sanders was rendered defenseless. But Gailey considered it
a ``positive'' sign that Sanders finished the game.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Kevin Mathis (hamstring) will not practice or play
again this week. This will be the third game in the last four weeks
that he misses.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' ongoing battle of attrition due to injuries has
produced a bunker-like mindset, Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a bunch of fighters now ... and that can carry you a
long way,'' said Gailey. ``This game was a starting point for us.
We just need to build on this, and go from here.''
</P>
<P>
   Against Arizona, Allen will be replaced by either rookie Solomon
Page, an offensive tackle who was converted to guard briefly in
training camp because of injuries, or veteran backup Tom Myslinski,
who played most of the second half Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The long-term possibility of losing Allen would favor Page, a
second-round pick in the 1999 draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best we got (to replace Allen),'' said Houck, adding
that Page's athletic ability allows him to bounce between his
natural position _ offensive tackle _ and guard, although this
isn't the same right guard position that Page played in preseason.
</P>
<P>
   If Aikman is out, Jason Garrett will continue to be the Cowboys
quarterback. Garrett, 6-2 as an NFL starter, has shown that the
Cowboys can win when he is called upon to replace Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quarterback is more about making good decisions than it is
about how strong your arm is or how far you can throw it or how
tight a spiral you have or how fast you can run,'' Gailey said.
``And Jason makes good decisions ... he doesn't hold the football
(too long). He anticipates what is given to him. He sees the
coverages and makes the right play. And he understands exactly what
his role (as a backup) is, so he is prepared for this.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Warren, who was benched after he fumbled twice Sunday and
was replaced by free agent Robert Chancey, will start Sunday at
Arizona if Smith is unable to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris didn't like it but he understood it,'' Gailey said of
the third-quarter benching. ``I talked to him after the game ...
(and) if we play this week without Emmitt again, Chris is our
starter.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said that Warren has no history of fumbling. But after
two fumbles in 19 carries, Gailey decided that Warren was out of
chances until next week. nn

WINNING AT HOME KEY TO A PLAYOFF BERTH, COWBOYS COACH SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Much has been made about the Dallas Cowboys'
problems on the road, especially against nondivision teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, 0-4 on the road this season, are 0-9 against
non-division opponents on the road since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The flip side is that the Cowboys have been stellar at home,
which Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said could be the key to their
playoff hopes in the parity-filled NFL in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's victory against the Green Bay Packers was the Cowboys'
12th consecutive in the regular season at Texas Stadium. They are
4-0 at home in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said it's no coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our guys do take a little extra pride playing at
home,'' Gailey said. ``Home games are important; you have to take
care of your home schedule. It's one of the factors in getting into
the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said the Texas Stadium crowd made a big difference
against the Packers and could be a big factor as the season goes
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the crowd was into it,'' Gailey said. ``If we can
keep this going, they will make a big difference down the stretch.
We've got some important games coming up at home.''
</P>
<P>
   After traveling to Arizona to face the Cardinals this weekend,
four of the Cowboys' final six games are at home.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey is not overlooking the Cowboys road troubles, saying they
need to win a couple on the road too. CUNNINGHAM SAVES HIS JOB
</P>
<P>
   A week after saying Richie Cunningham is our kicker, Chan Gailey
admitted that there had been thoughts of replacing the struggling
kicker.
</P>
<P>
   The thoughts got stronger in the first quarter against the
Packers when Cunningham missed a 22-yard field-goal attempt that
dropped him to 6-for-14 for the season.
</P>
<P>
   But Cunningham bounced back with makes of 44 and 47 yards. None
were bigger than the former, which came as time expired in the
first half after the kicking team had to be rushed on the field
with no timeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said the situation was probably best for Cunningham, as
he didn't have time to think. Gailey also praised the entire
kicking unit, namely snapper Dale Hellestrae, holder Eric Bjornson
and members of the offensive line for keeping up with the clock.
</P>
<P>
   The big winner was Cunningham, who was greeted with a huge hug
by offensive tackle Erik Williams following the kick.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said there's no doubt that Cunningham and the whole team
are relieved and that everybody wants him to do well. But he said
the key now is becoming more consistent and warned against people
getting too carried away with patting him on the back. COWBOYS WORK
OUT DBs
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys worked out two players Monday and plan on looking at
former Cowboy Wendell Davis on Tuesday in an attempt to shore up
their injury-depleted secondary.

Cowboys are looking to make a roster move. It could come as soon as
Tuesday.

Donnie Brady and Vashone Adams. Davis is looking to get back into
the league after being released by the Cowboys in the offseason. He

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
FOR whatever small consolation it may be for Mike Hampton, I can
think of three fairly decent pitchers who made it to the Hall of
Fame without winning the Cy Young Award.
</P>
<P>
   The three who come easily to mind are Don Sutton, Phil Niekro
and Nolan Ryan. Idly, you wonder how Ryan missed out in 1973, when
he rang up 21 wins for the Angels, completed 26 of his starts,
pitched two no-hitters and broke the record of Sandy Koufax with
383 strikeouts in a season.
</P>
<P>
   But the award went to Jim Palmer, who had one of his typically
brilliant years for the Orioles, going 22-9 with an earned run
average of 2.40, a league best. The choice was close, and it
bothered Nolan when he read what Palmer told the press: ``Ryan goes
for strikeouts, and I go for outs.''
</P>
<P>
   In time, Nolan realized it was simply a matter of style.
</P>
<P>
   Tricky business, this Cy Young competition. Until Randy Johnson
joined him Monday, Gaylord Perry was the only pitcher to win the
award in each league. He did it with Cleveland in 1972, then
repeated himself in 1978 when he won 21 games for a weak San Diego
team. He was 40 years old at season's end.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Valenzuela was the original Teletubby at age 20 during
a 1981 season that saw him earn his trophy. The Dodgers sent a
scout to his village in Mexico to bring back his birth certificate.
</P>
<P>
   It hardly seems fair, when so many pitchers would settle so
gladly for one, that Roger Clemens has collected five Cy Youngs
with Boston and Toronto and now he has a World Series ring with the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   But the award for the most single-minded pitcher in memory still
goes to Steve ``Lefty'' Carlton, who earned four trophies in 11
seasons and did it without talking to the press. He didn't have
much to say to the hitters, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carlton did not pitch to the hitter; he pitched through him,''
his catcher, Tim McCarver, once explained. ``The batter hardly
existed for Steve. He was playing an elevated game of catch.''
</P>
<P>
   The day after he topped Robin Roberts' record for career
strikeouts by a Philadelphia pitcher, Carlton had to call the
club's publicity office.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was that record I broke?'' he asked. ``Some lady wants me
to write it on a ball.''
</P>
<P>
   In intensity, if not in physical appearance, Hampton inspires a
comparison to Carlton. No pitcher brings to the park a more
complete package than the combative Houston lefthander. He helps
himself at bat, with the glove and with his demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers sparkle: 22 wins, four losses, an 11-game winning
streak, an ERA under 3.00. And yet the numbers don't do him
justice. He started 34 times, and the Astros won all but five of
those games.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the club has kept a candle burning in the window for
a classic southpaw starter who can stay healthy and pile up
innings, who keeps his temper and his aim under control. Now, they
have one. This was Hampton's breakout season.
</P>
<P>
   There is no shame, of course, in finishing second to Randy
Johnson, the Big Unit, the 6-10 intimidator whose tousled,
shoulder-length hair has the capacity to put hitters in a slump.
Johnson's 17-9 record failed to reflect the games when Arizona
didn't score for him or when the bullpen blew leads. But he had the
lowest ERA and the most strikeouts in the league, and he has what
Hampton has just begun to acquire: Name Brand Recognition.
</P>
<P>
   You doubt any loud protests would have been lodged if the voters
had blessed Michael, but we sense a certain irony when his Houston
teammates argue that wins should be the major criterion. When Mike
Scott captured the only Cy Young Award in franchise history in
1986, he did it with 18 wins _ but a strikeout title and a
no-hitter dripping with drama. It clinched the division title
against the Giants. Still, Valenzuela (21) and San Francisco's Mike
Krukow (20) had more victories.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching is not a stable occupation, and you never know what the
next spin of the wheel will bring. But considering Hampton is 27,
time is in his favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a lot of baseball ahead of me,'' he said. ``My
confidence is at an all-time high. I'm at a point where I feel
comfortable in everything I do.''
</P>
<P>
   With only the slightest nudge, Houston fans can recall the pain
of losing the National League championship to the Mets in 1986,
with Scott ready to start a seventh game that went unplayed.
</P>
<P>
   So more than their Cy Young finish, this is what bonds Randy
Johnson and Mike Hampton today. You suspect either pitcher would
forgo being considered for any trophy, any jewelry, for a chance to
pitch in the World Series. Of course, there is no rule that says
you can't do both.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
YOU ponder the fact that somehow the Rockets have become the
mystery meat of the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, with the addition of Scottie Pippen, they were at
least able to sit under the shrink wrap in the butcher's case and
try to pass themselves off as top sirloin.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, they are Spam, hardly tasty and barely digestible.
</P>
<P>
   We have been told so often that the chemistry of a basketball
team is as fragile as crystal, we are almost convinced. Did the
Rockets take a hammer to theirs?
</P>
<P>
   So which is it? Are they at least taking lumps now with a hazy
purpose for the future? Or is what we are seeing the stunted growth
of a stubborn three-packs-a-day smoker who will never stand tall
enough to see the top of the kitchen table?
</P>
<P>
   This 96-87 loss to the Indiana Pacers on Monday night would not
be so painful to bear if it did not look like so many of the others
in a 2-6 start. It is still just November in the television season,
and the Rockets are already showing reruns again and again that
have less character development than an episode of Baywatch.
</P>
<P>
   Stop me if you've heard this one:
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets couldn't complete the job, couldn't close the door,
couldn't find the finish line if it had been painted on the ocean
and they were falling off the deck of a cruise ship.
</P>
<P>
   They had the Pacers down but couldn't take them out. They had
plenty of hustle and enthusiasm but, like a class of
kindergartners, no idea what to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets took a 63-53 lead and spit it back up with
turnovers, bad shots and a general lack of understanding of what to
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't mind it if a team was just better than us and came
in here with a lot more talent and beat us,'' said Hakeem Olajuwon.
``That's easy to take. But that's not the case with us. I guess we
have to learn how to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that lesson would be easier to comprehend if the Rockets
took the floor every night knowing what they were really trying to
do.
</P>
<P>
   Is this truly the dawning of a new era with a commitment to the
running game and athleticism? Or barely two weeks on one arena
referendum turndown is this already a club retreating too quickly
into the shell of its familiar former self?
</P>
<P>
   This is a team that has the rookie Steve Francis capable of
doing wonderful things, as evidenced again by his 18 points, 12
assists and six rebounds. This is a team that has Charles Barkley
working with all the pride and determination of a 16-year veteran
making his last pass through the league to grab a whopping 24
rebounds to go with his 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this remains a team that doesn't appear to have a clue as to
how to get its premier free-agent acquisition Shandon Anderson
involved in the proceeding, as indicated by another four-point game
that saw him play just 17 minutes and watch all of the fourth
quarter from the bench.
</P>
<P>
   While it is true that the Rockets are not adept at handling the
ball on the run, they are surely not going to get better at it if
they don't keep the pedal to the metal and work out the kinks. This
is a club that said it was turning over a new leaf by getting rid
of the spot-up-shooting likes of Matt Maloney, Brent Price and Sam
Mack but finds itself standing under the shade of that old tree too
many times.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you play that way, it's just too predictable,'' said
Anderson. ``Teams work the whole day on how to defend the post,
defending 3-point shooting. So when you get down to the fourth
quarter, they really have the game plan down. If we had different
options, it's really hard to defend.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the coaches) make the decisions. You have to run the
plays that are called. You can't go on your own and go one-on-one
and try to beat them one-on-five. It has to be a team effort.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get better at the fast break,'' said Barkley, ``and
I don't know why we don't do it more.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, they are not doing it because they have already
talked themselves into being desperate for wins. It is so early,
and all that counts in the NBA is how you're doing late. But we are
already hearing too much about statistics and percentages and what
works.
</P>
<P>
   But let's ask this: What really is working when you're 2-6?
</P>
<P>
   When you cut off most of the running opportunities at midcourt
and settle into a half-court game, you are putting a premium on
every possession. That actually works against a bad ball-handling
team, because each turnover is more critical and there are fewer
chances to get back.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe in today's plodding, conservative NBA, it is impossible to
run every time. But you can and should look to run every time. Bill
Fitch was in the house Monday night. Maybe somebody could have
asked him how it's done.
</P>
<P>
   Before we all nod off from boredom.

20/20 VISION MIGHT BE CLEARER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Los Angeles Kings coach Andy Murray shuddered Sunday night when
reminded that he planned to evaluate this year's team in four
20-game increments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't you get back to me after 40 games,'' he said, not
wanting to get too excited that the Kings' 3-2 victory over Phoenix
tied them with Ottawa for the best record in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard not to get excited when a team with just one playoff
appearance in the last six years is tied for the Western Conference
lead, especially when many picked it last in its division.
</P>
<P>
   Kings fans should remember it is still early, but tonight's game
with Chicago at Staples Center will be their 20th this season. For
the Kings, and the rest of the NHL, the first six weeks of the
post-Wayne Gretzky era have been busy.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas and Buffalo, last year's Stanley Cup finalists, still are
fighting serious hangovers. The Stars should recover. The Sabres,
without goalie Dominik Hasek, might not.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the restricted free agents _ like Edmonton's Bill Guerin
and Boston's Byron Dafoe _ finally have re-signed. Unrestricted
free agent Joe Murphy also signed with the Bruins after the New
York Rangers appeared to have a deal done.
</P>
<P>
   But it has been that kind of year for the Rangers, who have six
victories and only five power-play goals to show for their record
$59 million payroll.
</P>
<P>
   After slow starts that caused a tremendous uproar in Boston and
Philadelphia, the Bruins and Flyers have calmed jittery fans and
front offices with long unbeaten streaks.
</P>
<P>
   In Ottawa, the Senators tied the Kings, Detroit and Toronto with
a league-high 26 points even though their top player Alexei Yashin
is sitting out the season.
</P>
<P>
   The holdout has caused some fans to sue the team and now the
Senators want to sue Yashin for breach of contract. He refused to
play this year for $3.5 million and the team says he owes them next
season at the same salary.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Senators are up for sale as they try to get the
Canadian government to cut them a deal on an arena tax. Ottawa and
Montreal pay more tax than the other 26 teams combined.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't as bad as the Canadiens' nine-game winless streak
that put them in last place long before the first snowfall. This
could be a long winter for some.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Florida, where the Panthers are in first place despite
the absence of high-scoring Pavel Bure. That team also is for sale.
At least owner Wayne Huizenga does not have plans to gut the team
the way he did with baseball's Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   Huizenga paid $50 million for the expansion franchise in 1992.
Within the past year, several teams have been sold. The Colorado
Avalanche was had for about $230 million; the Washington Capitals
were part of a $200 million deal that included the MCI Center; the
Tampa Bay Lightning was sold for $115 million.
</P>
<P>
   With numbers like that, it is not surprising that the NHL
Players Association is taking a harder line in an attempt to raise
salaries. But this is a sport that only gets $7 million per team
for its national TV contract.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Kings, with all their luxury boxes, have to deal with
red ink.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't seem so bad when you have the third-best power
play in the league. Last year, the Kings were 24th. Down in
Anaheim, though, the Ducks are the third-worst team with the man
advantage. A year ago, they were the best.
</P>
<P>
   The league is excited about the new overtime rules, where teams
play four-on-four in an effort to boost scoring. The league-wide
buzz is that the sport will go to four-on-four permanently by the
middle of the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   The fans seem to like it, much more than they like Calgary
goaltender Grant Fuhr, who might be at the end of the line after
more than 400 victories and five Stanley Cups, if the boos are any
indication.
</P>
<P>
   It's a little sad when you think of Fuhr as part of some bygone
era. He and Tom Barrasso are the last goalies to get picked in the
first round who played immediately. Fuhr was 19, Barrasso 18.
</P>
<P>
   That will never happen again. Recently, Kings GM Dave Taylor was
ecstatic after seeing young goaltender Alexey Volkov in the minors,
but admitted the kid probably is still four years away.
</P>
<P>
   Where will the league be in four years? Flourishing? Bankrupt?
</P>
<P>
   Stay tuned. It's too hard to tell even 20 games ahead. &QL;

... COWBOYS GET TASTE OF REAL TRIPLETS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``A season can turn on this kind of team performance.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's how colleague Randy Galloway ended Monday's column on the
Dallas Cowboys' 27-13 victory over the Green Bay Packers at Texas
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   All he needed for the perfect segue to Tuesday's modest essay by
yours truly was a ...
</P>
<P>
   You know: dot, dot, dot.
</P>
<P>
   To be continued, in other words.
</P>
<P>
   He is absolutely right, but don't tell him I said so. I'll even
take it a step further. I will humbly submit that Sunday's
triplet-less triumph over the staggeringly inept Packers was the
Cowboys' biggest victory of the season.
</P>
<P>
   That statement is made not necessarily because of how much the
victory meant, though it did shove the Cowboys back into a tie for
the NFC East lead with the Washington Redskins and New York Giants.
</P>
<P>
   More critical was how devastating a loss would have been.
</P>
<P>
   If ever a team needed some good news, something positive to
build upon, it was the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   A victory over the suddenly pitiful Packers is certainly not a
panacea for everything that ails the Cowboys. They're still your

O'NEAL TAKES OUT FRUSTRATIONS ON PHOENIX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ From multiple ejections to multiple rejections, the
pendulum that is Shaquille O'Neal's season stopped momentarily
Monday, then swung mightily in the opposite direction. The poor
Phoenix Suns were stuck in its path and got clobbered.
</P>
<P>
   As if to announce an end to the tumultuous week that was, O'Neal
put all the free-throw embarrassments, technical fouls,
disqualifications, fines and suspensions behind him and channeled
all that anger into one truly inspired performance.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-four points. Eight blocked shots. Eighteen rebounds. And
a 91-82 Los Angeles Lakers victory over the explosive Suns on their
home court.
</P>
<P>
   This all came with fair warning. O'Neal himself repeated several
times that he plays better when he's teed off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just an awesome game,'' coach Phil Jackson said of his
center's performance.
</P>
<P>
   And an angry game? O'Neal wouldn't say so, but his friend and
teammate Glen Rice said it was clear the big man had some tension
to unleash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, you can see it,'' Rice said. ``One of the things he's
definitely going to do is give it his all. He realizes teams are
going to take their shots at him, but he's going to stay under
control and let his game speak for himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Message received.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long to hear it coming either. O'Neal opened with
a 12-point first quarter and by halftime had 18 points, five
rebounds and five blocks _ two against Luc Longley, one each
against Clifford Robinson, Rodney Rogers and former teammate Penny
Hardaway.
</P>
<P>
   Despite logging 43 minutes and playing on a twisted left ankle,
with a sore right shoulder, O'Neal also finished strong _ 10
points, seven rebounds and two blocked shots in the fourth quarter.
He even improved his foul shooting when it counted most _ 6 of 10
in the final period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still don't think I dominated,'' O'Neal said. ``I still
missed too many (free) throws, but I hit one 1 of 2 when I was at
the line. I'm just going to keep practicing. It can't get no worse.
It can only get better. . . . I'm the type of player, I like to be
as close to perfect as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns, who trailed by as much as 10 points in the first half,
pulled within two points at the 2:16 mark. But the Lakers were able
to pull away on a Derek Fisher 17-footer, a Glen Rice free throw,
and an O'Neal block of Hardaway. Then O'Neal hit 2 of 4 foul shots
to make it 87-80 with 1:02 to go, and the Lakers had sealed a
significant win over one of the most highly touted teams in the
West.
</P>
<P>
   And concluded for now O'Neal's strange early season odyssey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't really been a roller-coaster ride,'' he said. ``We
lost two games, it was 100 percent my fault (for getting ejected).
I think we could have got one of those games if I was there, but
we're all still learning each other, we're all still having a good
time, I'm pleased with our record. We've played nine games _ 7-2,
that's good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns laid off O'Neal early, and he didn't shoot a single
free throw in the first half as he made 9 of 16 shots. That
strategy changed in the second half, and O'Neal went to the line
seven times, but made 5 of 11 field goals anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't really know what they wanted to do with him,''
Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal had plenty of support _ 23 points from Rice and 18 from
Fisher, who was 5 for 11 to post his second straight big-scoring
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher struggled, however, to contain multitalented Jason Kidd
in the second half. Jackson replaced him with the taller Brian Shaw
for a long spell but returned Fisher to the floor for the final
five minutes. He responded with five points down the stretch.

REDSKINS RECEIVERS RESORT TO PLAYING BLAME GAME AFTER LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even when things have been at their worst _ amid the
season-ending losing streaks in 1997 and 1998, and amid the
two-game losing streak they just snapped _ the Cowboys rarely were
a team that pointed fingers at one another.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Aikman and Emmitt Smith didn't single out some poor guy for
not blocking. Darren Woodson didn't single out the defensive line
for not getting any pressure on the quarterback. Michael Irvin
didn't blame the coaching staff. Team owner Jerry Jones didn't
threaten to fire the whole team if they didn't make him a bigger
return on his buck.
</P>
<P>
   But in Washington, it's the blame game. And the culprits, after
a 35-28 loss to the lowly Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday, were
big-mouth wide receivers Albert Connell and Michael Westbrook.
(Yes, the same Connell-Westbrook duo that said last month that
Deion Sanders couldn't cover them.)
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles began their winning drive against the Redskins late
in the fourth quarter after linebacker Al Harris ripped the ball
out of Connell's hands. Connell blamed his quarterback, Brad
Johnson, instead of himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to stop an interception,'' Connell said. ``It was
a bad pass. Bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   Connell also blamed the offensive line, which allowed four sacks
of Johnson. Connell said the sacks hindered the quarterback's
ability to find open receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and Mike (Westbrook) were killing their corners,'' Connell
said. ``We've got to give our quarterback time.''
</P>
<P>
   Westbrook blamed the coaching staff for allowing certain players
to make mistakes in practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain guys, it's like they can't do anything wrong,''
Westbrook said. ``No one's pointing fingers, but we need to be held
accountable for our mistakes in practice. If you're going to make
mistakes, someone needs to tell someone something. I'm told when I
make mistakes. It should be fair, is all I'm saying.''
</P>
<P>
   Westbrook's and Connell's comments all make good copy for the
media. But locker rooms are often divided when players come out in
public to point the finger of blame at someone else. The Cowboys'
locker room usually doesn't yield such spicy sound bites for the
evening news. But at least you get the feeling that people are
pulling for one another at Valley Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   You can't say the same for the folks in the nation's capital.
STUPID COACH TRICK
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Ross. Detroit Lions. With 5:26 remaining in the Lions'
loss at Arizona, Ross ordered his club to go for a 2-point
conversion after Terry Fair scored on a 35-yard fumble return. The
conversion attempt failed.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with this strategy is that the Lions, at the time,
trailed 23-19. Had Ross called on the kicking unit, then the Lions
most likely would have trailed only 23-20 when they got the ball on
their final possession of the game.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the Lions reached the Arizona 11-yard line with 1:09
to play. Down four instead of three however, the Lions had to try
to score a touchdown instead of a chip-shot Jason Hanson field
goal. The game-winning drive stalled at the 11, and the Lions'
four-game winning streak ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a card that lists all the situations, and in that
one, it says to go for one, or go for two if you want to win the
game,'' said Ross, whose club actually failed to convert ``two''
2-point conversions on Sunday. ``We didn't want to go into overtime
_ not with three games in 11 days and as banged-up on special teams
as we were.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hindsight's always 20-20. I thought we were going to play to
win it. I had thought it through. It was not a snap decision.''
</P>
<P>
   And it didn't turn out to be a smart one, either. OBSERVATIONS
</P>
<P>
   How bad is it in San Francisco? The 49ers have lost back-to-back
games against the only teams who have ``lost'' to the expansion
Cleveland Browns: Pittsburgh and New Orleans. ... Depending on what
the 49ers and Carolina Panthers do in the next two weeks, the St.
Louis Rams could conceivably win the NFC West with victories in
their next two games at San Francisco and vs. the Saints. ... Seven
AFC teams have at least six victories. One of those clubs won't
make the playoffs, but that team would have a good chance of
reaching the Super Bowl if it played in the NFC.
LYONS' TOP 5 1. Indianapolis 7-2 2. Jacksonville 8-1 3. Buffalo 7-3
4. Miami 7-2 5. St. Louis 7-2
GRADING THE NFL Lawrence Phillips: F The troubled running back has
apparently flunked with his third team. Upset because of his
limited role in San Francisco's offense, he refused to practice
last week and mocked coach Steve Mariucci. The team suspended him
indefinitely then said Monday he would never play for them again.
What a waste. Robert Smith: A The Minnesota Vikings-Chicago Bears
game wasn't the only thing ``in a tight.'' Smith, the Vikings
running back, drank a lot of water to fight off dehydration in his
first game back after a hernia injury. ``I was drinking (water)
like crazy,'' he said. ``Then, starting in the middle of the third
quarter I had to use the bathroom. When we went into overtime, I
just had to hang on.'' He did, and so did the Vikings. Jim Miller:
A The Bears thought they had a quarterback controversy with Shane
Matthews and rookie Cade McNown. Turns out, their best quarterback
might be journeyman Jim Miller, who passed for 422 yards in the
club's overtime loss to Minnesota. That was the most yards passing
in a game by a Bears quarterback since Bill Wade passed for 466
against the Cowboys in 1962.

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Larry Bird walked into Compaq Center on Monday morning, and his
eyes instinctively were drawn to the 3-point line he had claimed
almost two decades earlier.
<TEXT>
<P>
   From that spot, he recalled happily, he clinched his first
championship, beating the Rockets with a 3-pointer for the 1981 NBA
title.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, he still owns every bit of Compaq Center hardwood
that is 23 feet, 9 inches from the rim.
</P>
<P>
   A few good things have happened to the Rockets, in general and
from the 3-point line, since Bird first came to town. But with the
Pacers' coach back for one last visit, the Rockets shot themselves
out of contention Monday, losing to Indiana 96-87, their fifth
consecutive home defeat to start the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our chance,'' Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. ``We
had wide-open looks. You make them, you win. You miss them, you
sing the blues.''
</P>
<P>
   B.B. King's favorite team had led by 10 in the third quarter and
seven in the fourth. But they basically took the final quarter off.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what it's all about,'' Tomjanovich said of the fourth
quarter. ``Playing during the course of the game is good. When it
really counts, you have to make the plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played well for a lot of stretches. But when it went bad,
it went really bad. We needed someone to make a play. We made five
turnovers in a row at a crucial point. But we came back and had
another shot. We had as good or better shots. We didn't knock them
down. They did.''
</P>
<P>
   Until a pair of meaningless late bombs fell with the Pacers well
ahead, the Rockets had made just one of 15 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   After recovering from a stunning five-minute collapse, the
Rockets made the decision to live or die with their post-up game.
And for a few minutes, it worked. Hakeem Olajuwon hit a pair of
six-footers. Charles Barkley, who finished with a season-high 24
rebounds, twice followed Olajuwon misses to score inside, pulling
the Rockets within 81-79 with 2{ minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pacers double-teamed hard inside. And the Rockets went
back to bombing away from outside. Walt Williams and Cuttino Mobley
each missed 3-pointers. Olajuwon missed a jumper. Steve Francis
missed a 3, then another.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got good shots down the stretch,'' Barkley said. ``They
just didn't go in. When you get good shots that don't go in,
there's nothing you can do about that. You get a wide-open shot,
and you take it. If it goes in, everybody tells you you're great.
If you miss, everybody is (complaining).''
</P>
<P>
   While the Rockets tried to gun their way back into the game, the
Pacers made six of eight free throws and added one final turn of
the knife Bird could appreciate _ a 30-footer from Mark Jackson
that swished.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the Rockets had accurately shot themselves in the foot.
</P>
<P>
   Before their downfall, the Rockets had led since midway through
the second quarter. They held the Pacers, one of the league's best
offensive teams, to 39.8 percent shooting, the fifth consecutive
game a Rockets opponent has shot 40 percent or worse. Besides
Barkley's rebounding dominance, he, Olajuwon and Francis had 18
points apiece. Francis had a season-best 12 assists and added six
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   With just less than 10 minutes remaining, the Rockets led 71-64.
But they came up with a collapse to rival anything in their 0-5
start.
</P>
<P>
   In a 3{-minute stretch, the Pacers reeled off 15 unanswered
points, with the Rockets' offense hitting a sudden and complete
meltdown. In that stretch, the Rockets missed four shots from the
field and two from the line and committed four turnovers. It added
up to nine possessions without scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley drove the lane but had his shot blocked. Olajuwon tried
a fadeaway from the corner but left it short. Barkley posted up,
drew a double team and found Williams open at the 3-point arc.
Williams missed. Francis tried a drive but turned the ball over.
Olajuwon posted up but threw the ball away. The Rockets set up a
play for Mobley, who missed a 3.
</P>
<P>
   But contrary to their fourth-quarter fades in the season's first
week, the Rockets recovered to pull back within two.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, put the game back in the hands of their outside
touch, which failed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like in the first half we were attacking the basket
more,'' Mobley said. ``I shot 2-for-10. I feel real bad about that
one. In the second half, we were real tentative. They got us in a
half-court set, and we didn't knock down our shots. I personally
take a lot of blame. It's just shots I know I should have made.
When we run plays for our big men, we have to stay out there to get
spacing. But we should have attacked the basket.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams argued that he should get at least as much blame. He
made half of his eight shots but missed all four of his 3s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't miss outside shots. I did,'' Williams said. ``Just
let me hit a shot. I missed wide-open shots. I also made a crucial
foul trying to get a steal. That's a mental mistake. But man, we
missed wide-open shots, me and Cuttino. Those are good looks.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockets found out again that it's not the shots you take
that count. It's the ones you make.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it really counts,'' Tomjanovich said, ``we have to make
the plays.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets' tormentor on the other bench understood.

   &UR; CHINA-U.S. TRADE AGREEMENT (Moved in ``i'' or ``f''
categories) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-U.S.-ASSESS (Washington) _ A news analysis: In the end,
this was the deal Bill Clinton had to sign, both to jump-start U.S.
relations with China and to save whatever claim he has left as the
president who made trade and commercial diplomacy the centerpiece
of American foreign policy. By David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-U.S.-IMPACT (Shanghai) _ A news analysis: Although the
immediate effects of China's landmark trade agreement with the
United States may be mixed, the deal is a major victory for Prime
Minister Zhu Rongji, an advocate of reform who has been under
fierce fire from conservative opponents in recent months. By Seth
Faison.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-U.S.-CONGRESS (Washington) _ The Clinton administration
and business groups prepared an intense campaign Monday to win
approval in Congress for China's entry into the World Trade
Organization, facing opposition from conservatives who object to
almost any dealings with China and liberals who say the trade pact
would be bad for workers. Members of both parties said the deal
would most likely be approved in the key battleground, the House,
based on the solid bipartisan majority that granted China a
one-year extension of favorable trading terms earlier this year. By
Richard W. Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-U.S.-CANDIDATES (Washington) _ The Clinton
administration's agreement to support China's membership in the WTO
laid bare the deep divisions among Republican candidates for
president on the nature of relations between the United States and
China. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Sen. John McCain of Arizona
gave qualified endorsements of the trade deal, saying that bringing
China into the global trading scheme would help moderate its
economic and political behavior. But the more conservative
candidates for the Republican presidential nomination condemned the
deal, accusing the administration of ignoring gross human rights
violations in its eagerness to expand commerce with the world's
most populous nation. The two Democratic candidates, Vice President
Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley, applauded the trade
agreement, although aides said that Bradley would reserve final
judgment until he had had a chance to study its terms. By John M.
Broder.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-U.S.-BEIJING (Beijing) _ Many Chinese were pinching
themselves Monday afternoon, filled with disbelief that, after more
than a decade of false starts, China had actually taken the plunge
into the international economy, signing a landmark trade agreement
with the United States. By Elisabeth Rosenthal.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-U.S.-BARSHEFSKY (Washington) _ A woman-in-the-news profile
of the U.S. trade representative. By David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-U.S.-WINNERS (Undated) _ Corporate America, with only a
few exceptions, hailed the agreement reached Monday between China
and the United States as a wonderful opportunity to expand rapidly
into the giant Chinese market. Looking at what U.S. industries

China-related companies surged here Monday as investors concluded
that a landmark trade agreement between the United States and China
_ and the competition it promises _ would help Chinese companies
more than hurt them. By Mark Landler.

   CHINA-U.S.-MOORE (Geneva, Switzerland) _ While hailing the
accord clearing the way for China's entry into the World Trade
Organization, Mike Moore, the trade regulator's chief, also

   ATM-FEES (Santa Monica, Calif.) _ This suburb of Los Angeles
last month passed the nation's first local ordinance banning banks
from charging non-customers for using their ATMs, and Bank of
America retaliated by denying non-customers use of its machines.
San Francisco voters approved a similar measure earlier this month,
and now, legislators in other cities and states are said to be
looking at similar ordinances. New York City Council speaker Peter
Vallone said he plans to propose such a law, and the Los Angeles
City Council has instructed the city attorney to study the city's
authority to enact such a ban. By Andrew Pollack.

   LOBBY (Washington) _ When lobbying first became a serious
profession a few decades ago, the ground rules were pretty basic.
About two dozen members of Congress decreed the way most issues
were decided, and an effective lobbyist had to cultivate a personal
relationship with at least one of them to have any real influence.
But now lobbying has turned into a well-ordered global business,
with the influence game taking on a decidedly corporate look. By

Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory. The signals of
gravity waves reaching the earth from the merger of black holes and

Garwin, 71, one of the federal government's most widely respected
science advisers, remains optimistic despite one of the worst
defeats of his career, the Senate rejection of the nuclear test
treaty. An adviser to six presidents, including Clinton, Garwin
says he is now taking on the treaty's most vociferous public foes
one by one, writing letters, challenging their claims, suggesting
that they debate him publicly and generally trying to undo what he
regards as the trashing of the factual record. By William J. Broad.

<P>
   SCI-ORPHAN-DISEASES (Undated) _ About 5,000 rare disorders are
classified as ``orphan diseases,'' and at one point stood little
chance to be cured, as drug researchers ignored them, assuming
there would be too few customers to make it pay to develop
treatments. Many of the disorders are severe or fatal, and in 1983,
hoping to encourage research, the government began offering tax
credits, research grants and other incentives to companies working
on rare diseases. Now the orphans drugs prove a boon to some
pharmaceutical companies, and some have made more than $1 billion a
year as a result. By Denise Grady.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BUFFALO-DECLINE (Undated) _ As portrayed in a number of new
books, the real story of the decline of the buffalo involves a
dramatic change in climate, competition for forage and cattle-borne
disease. Another key factor, the authors say, were Indian tribes,
empowered by the horse and gun and driven to hunt buffalo for the
profits that came from hides and meat. By Jim Robbins.

   SCI-LEONID-METEORS (Undated) _ Experts forecast that the Leonid
meteor shower, which occurs when Earth travels through a plume of
dust particles from the comet Tempel-Tuttle, may provide quite a

hour arcing through the sky late Wednesday and early Thursday. By
Henry Fountain.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GIRLS (Undated) _ Girls today need not go it alone, naive or
humorless. There are sources where they can learn about their
bodies, minus the medicalese and pious homilies. At the forefront
of this female informist movement is a new book, ``Deal With It! A
Whole New Approach to Your Body, Brain and Life as a Gurl.'' Based
on a Web site, gURL.com, that three women started in 1996, the book
offers a frank, detailed and zealously nonjudgmental take on all
aspects of girlhood. By Natalie Angier.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PRESCRIPTIONS (Undated) _ When it comes to regulating
tobacco use, saving people from themselves is a tricky business,
especially when prescriptions are the means to the end. This is a
lesson that sinks in only slowly after medical school. Young
doctors think their prescriptions are sacrosanct, little pieces of
delivered wisdom. Eventually they discover their prescriptions are
just little pieces of paper. Just because you write someone a
prescription doesn't mean they will take the medication. Just
because you withhold a prescription doesn't mean they won't. The
hoary and jaded among us know that a prescription is really only a
suggestion, a word of friendly advice, nothing more. By Abigail
Zuger, M.D.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Second of two columns on what can
be done safely in pregnancy. Not so long ago, pregnant women were
almost universally warned to avoid strenuous activity. But faced
with women's growing interest in exercise and sports and their
desire to stay in shape while a new life takes shape within them,
doctors gave exercise during pregnancy a second look. And to the
surprise of many, medical research has shown that most women can
safely continue to exercise throughout pregnancy, as long as they
make some sensible adjustments to their routines. By Jane E. Brody.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-HEART-MONITORS (Undated) _ Heart monitors may be useful for
exercise, especially for beginners, some fitness experts contend.
By Liz Neporent.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BACK-PAIN (Undated) _ Researchers in Chicago report that a
nontraditional therapy for back pain seems to work as well as more
common treatments like analgesics and physical therapy, with fewer
drugs. The treatment is osteopathic manipulation, the complex set
of musculo-skeletal techniques used by osteopathic physicians. By
Alisha Berger.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Science question answered: What is
astigmatism? Could surgery have corrected it in El Greco? By C.
Claiborne Ray.

METEOR SHOWER WEDNESDAY MIGHT BE GREAT SHOW _ OR A DUD
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  A once-in-a-lifetime sky show could be on display this week if
the annual Leonid meteor shower blossoms into the full-blown storm
some experts predict.
<P>
   Then again, it could be a cosmic flop _ especially for the West
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   As happens every November, our planet is about to brush into the
dusty trail of Comet Tempel-Tuttle. The encounter creates the
appearance of ``shooting stars'' on Earth when meteors _ minute
particles of comet debris _ burn up in the outer atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   It usually takes a trained eye to notice anything unusual is
going on _ maybe 10 or 20 shooting stars per hour, all appearing to
emanate from the direction of the constellation Leo. That's barely
an increase from the usual number of meteors visible almost any
clear night.
</P>
<P>
   But this week, following a 33-year cycle traced by the comet's
path through the inner solar system, Earth will encounter a much
thicker dust cloud than usual. The peak is expected late Wednesday
night into early Thursday morning. Comet watchers will want to look
above the eastern-southeastern horizon.
</P>
<P>
   The climax of the last 33-year cycle came in November 1966.
Stunned scientists, who hadn't seen it coming, counted as many as
50 meteors a second arcing across the night sky _ roughly 144,000
shooting stars per hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all felt like we needed to put on hard hats,'' recalled one
observer at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Table Mountain
Observatory in Southern California. ``The sky was absolutely full
of meteors.''
</P>
<P>
   Earth's atmosphere creates an all-but impenetrable shield that
prevents any of the tiny particles from reaching the ground, so
hard hats are actually not necessary. But there's no such shield in
space.
</P>
<P>
   That's why military authorities, NASA and commercial satellite
operators all have taken steps to protect orbiting spacecraft that
could be hit by particles traveling at the speed of 156,000 miles
an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the storm is intense, there's a potential for damage,''
said Capt. Nicole Greenwood, a spokeswoman at the U.S. Air Force
Space Command in Colorado. Still, she added, ``we don't expect any
critical damage. We've done a lot of preparation.''
</P>
<P>
   Protecting spacecraft may turn out to be unnecessary. There
isn't a full-fledged storm every 33 years because of the peculiar
and unpredictable paths taken by cometary debris under the
influence of gravitational forces in the solar system.
</P>
<P>
   Some comet-watchers are predicting about 1,000 to 1,500 meteors
per hour this year at the peak, enough to create a nice show for
those with a good view. Unfortunately, the West Coast ``is not the
best place to be for this storm,'' said Bill Ailor, director of
orbital and re-entry debris studies at Aerospace Corp., a Southern
California think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Earth passes through the comet's orbital plane just before 2
a.m. London time Thursday. Based on the latest best guesses, that
would give Europe and North Africa the best vantage point, while
Californians will miss most of the action.
</P>
<P>
   Although the peak is expected Wednesday night or Thursday,
experts said it might be a good idea to take a look starting
tonight, after about 11 p.m., when Leo is high enough over the
horizon to be visible in the east-southeast region of the sky.

YOUNG BROADCASTING INC.'S SURPRISE BID WINS KRON
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DAN FOST 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  In a surprising move, little-known Young Broadcasting Inc. has
bought San Francisco's NBC television station KRON (Channel 4) for
$823 million.
<P>
   In buying the station from San Francisco's Chronicle Publishing
Young, a New York firm, outbid such media heavyweights as NBC's
parent, General Electric; Gannett Co.; and News Corp., the owner of
the Fox television network.
</P>
<P>
   The price is a record for a television station. Calling KRON a
``jewel,'' Young Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Vincent J.
Young said in an interview last night, ``I can't remember the last
time a No. 1 station was for sale in a top five market. It was an
incredible opportunity to build our company.''
</P>
<P>
   Young's bid consists of $650 million in cash and $173 million in
Young Broadcasting stock. The deal also includes a 51 percent stake
in the local cable station BayTV; the other 49 percent remains
owned by AT&AMP;T Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission must approve the deal
before it can be closed.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Young's 11 other stations are in midsize markets
throughout the Midwest and South, although the company also owns
KCAL in Los Angeles, the largest station in the country that is not
affiliated with a network.
</P>
<P>
   Media analyst Robin Flynn with Paul Kagan Associates in Carmel
said that with KCAL and KRON, ``Young is now a major force in
California.''
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Young said he does not plan any major changes at KRON.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing we think is most important in television stations is
the localism,'' he said. ``That's why KRON is the No. 1 station and
a news leader, because of its stress on the local community. That's
what our stations do. If we change anything, we'll just do more of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The station was put up for sale in June along with the rest of
Chronicle Publishing. KRON is the most valuable piece and one of
the last to be sold.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Chronicle Publishing also sold San Francisco's Chronicle
Books to its current editor-in-chief, Nion McEvoy.
</P>
<P>
   In August, The Chronicle was sold to Hearst Corp. for a reported
$660 million in a deal awaiting federal antitrust approval.
</P>
<P>
   The only remaining properties, television stations KAKE in
Wichita, Kan., and WOWT in Omaha, Neb., may be sold by next week.
</P>
<P>
   KRON is also the second-oldest holding in the family portfolio,
having begun broadcasting in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn, the media analyst, said she was surprised that Young
ended up winning KRON. The New York chain, the smallest of the
reported bidders, had actually put itself up for sale last June,
only to take itself off the market in September after it did not
get a satisfactory offer.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, NBC conducted a hard-charging campaign for
KRON. In a letter that leaked out last month, NBC President Robert
Wright warned Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette _ the investment bank
handling the sale of Chronicle Publishing's assets _ that any buyer
other than NBC would have to deal with a less favorable affiliation
agreement with the network.
</P>
<P>
   KRON's affiliation agreement with NBC runs until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   NBC then offered $700 million and a demand for exclusive
negotiating rights. The bid was rejected immediately, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Young has outbid NBC, it still needs the network's
programming. ``We intend to be a fabulous affiliate with NBC if the
relationship is two years or 200 years,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   Young has one other NBC-affiliated station, in Davenport, Iowa.
The firm also owns four ABC and six CBS stations.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Flynn said Young, although small compared with other
chains, is large enough to stand up to NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Young and his father, Adam Young, founded the company in
1986. According to the Web site for the Horatio Alger Association
of Distinguished Americans, Adam Young was the oldest of eight
children, and he dropped out of school at age 14 after his father
lost his job.
</P>
<P>
   He became an NBC page and was the network's first tour guide
when it moved to Rockefeller Center.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; x  &LR; He became involved in advertising and founded Adam Young
Inc., whose clients were radio stations, and then he brought his
son into the business. In 1986, they bought stations in Lansing,
Mich., and LaCrosse, Wis., and formed Young Broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Young, now 85, still serves on Young Broadcasting's
board of directors. The Young family owns nearly 60 percent of the
company. The rest is publicly traded.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn said Young demonstrated strong management abilities with
its ownership of KCAL in Los Angeles, acquiring the struggling
station in 1996 for $387 million and turning it around with a heavy
mix of sports programming, including broadcast rights to the
Anaheim Angels baseball team and the Los Angeles Lakers basketball
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the third quarter just ended, they grew revenues (at KCAL)
11 percent, which is phenomenal,'' Flynn said. ``That station has
been a real success story for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The company reported net income of $4 million (27 cents per
share) last year on revenues of $277 million.
</P>
<P>
   Young plans to announce the acquisition this morning before
trading opens on Wall Street. In Monday's trading, Young stock
closed up $1.09 at $51.78, off its 52-week high of $65.25 reached
in September.

THE REASON THE 49ERS CAN'T WIN
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ If you're cursing the 49ers these days, you're
too late.
<P>
   Eddie's been there, done that.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that's what I'm told by a guy named Bill Slayter. He
says he visited his psychic, who told Slayter that Eddie DeBartolo,
former (and still sort-of) owner of the 49ers, placed a curse on
the team as a lovely parting gift when he left town.
</P>
<P>
   (If this column had background music, right now you'd be hearing
Screamin' Jay Hawkins singing, ``I put a spell on you, because
you're mine.'')
</P>
<P>
   And there is solid proof of the existence of a curse. There's no
other way to explain the fact that the 49ers are giving serious
consideration to luring quarterback Jeff Hostetler out of
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, what about that Montana fella?
</P>
<P>
   Eddie D was knocked out as 49ers owner when he was convicted of
a felony involving shady doings associated with the Louisiana
riverboat gambling industry. The formal turnover of Eddie's team
ownership to his sister isn't complete, but he has left town,
seemingly in an ``after-all-I've-done-for-you'' frame of mind
toward the team and the city.
</P>
<P>
   In the unlikely event that Eddie D somehow manages to regain
full-powers ownership of the 49ers, I hope he can have the curse
removed. Let's hope he saved the receipt.
</P>
<P>
   WILLIE BROWN AND/OR TOM AMMIANO might want to help bury Harvey
Milk. Because it would be a nice thing for the mayor or the Board
of Supes president to do. And it might be worth some mayoral votes
in the gay community.
</P>
<P>
   The story is complicated, but here's the Reader's Digest
condensed version:
</P>
<P>
   Milk, the gay S.F. supervisor assassinated 21 years ago, has
never been fully interred. His ashes were scattered at sea, but an
urn with his ponytail, and some bits of memorabilia, was shipped to
the Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C., about 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be confused with Arlington National, Congressional is a
famed but cash-strapped cemetery. Among the celebs buried there are
John Philip Sousa, Mathew Brady and J. Edgar Hoover. Congressional
also has many cenotaphs (monuments to people buried elsewhere) of
great Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was a cenotaph for Milk, whose election to the Board of
Supes was a breakthrough for gays and gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   Problem: Not enough money was ever raised for the monument and
interment of the remains. My source says that Milk's future burial
site has a Styrofoam marker.
</P>
<P>
   Can Tom or Willie help give Harvey a proper burial? Does anyone
still care? As grass grows, the plot thickens.
</P>
<P>
   FIRST CHRISTMAS CARD, sort of, came via e-mail ad: ``It's here,
just in time for Xmas, Guaranteed Credit Cards!!!''
</P>
<P>
   Be up to your eyeballs in debt by Thanksgiving!
</P>
<P>
   Says the ad, ``You and your family will have the best Christmas
ever with Credit Express.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the road to financial hell now has an express lane!
</P>
<P>
   CURSE UPDATE: When fans turn on the 49ers, they really turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a lot of criticism of the NFL for blacking out
home TV of Raider games,'' says Warren Sugarman. ``Maybe they could
do the same for the 49ers as a humanitarian gesture.''
</P>
<P>
   Lotta Dotz says if the 49ers are going to be a doormat, they
should sell souvenir doormats, with a 49-month guarantee and a
likeness of Bill Walsh.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty soon, 49ers jokes. Why do we call 'em the 'Niners?
Because their offense is usually good for three field goals.
</P>
<P>
   SETTING STRAIGHT the record: Last week, KPIX showed a
documentary, ``Ed Sullivan's Greatest Hits: Two Decades of Rock &AMP;
Roll.''
</P>
<P>
   The program featured, as you may have guessed, musical
highlights from the old Ed Sullivan variety show. Flashed on the
screen at one point was a photo of Country Joe and the Fish, the
famed Berkeley protest band.
</P>
<P>
   The photo may have created the impression that Country Joe and
the Fish played Sullivan. Not quite. They were the only band ever
paid  &UR; not  &LR; to appear on the Sullivan show.
</P>
<P>
   They were booked in '68, but the night before they were to be on
Ed's show, they played at a beer festival in Central Park, where
they debuted their soon-to-be-famous ``Fish Cheer,'' where Country
Joe McDonald leads the audience, ``Gimme a big F! Gimme a big U!''
And so on, then, ``What's that spell?''
</P>
<P>
   Ed himself was in the audience that night. Joe and his Fish were
not only banned from the beer festival in perpetuity, but Ed
himself personally approached the lads backstage and told them they
could keep their $2,500 appearance fee, but they would never, ever
appear on his television show.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, last week there was a TV show about the Ed Sullivan
Show, and there was Country Joe and the Fish, crashing the party 31
years after the fact. The boys still haven't lost their touch.
</P>
<P>
   HOTTEST MAGAZINE anywhere has to be Bark, a quarterly published
in Berkeley and now on sale at newsstands in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a cultural arts magazine for dog lovers,'' says
editor/publisher Claudia Kawczynska.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine features original writing from top authors,
excerpts from hot books and cutting-edge design.
</P>
<P>
   The genre, I would say, is high-brow bow-wow.
</P>
<P>
   IN THIS CITY, no political angle is overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   Anonymous female caller says, ``I just want to let you know that
I'm sick of Bill Bradley's armpits. Papers and magazines keep
running pictures of him playing basketball, and you always see his
armpits. Is this his campaign logo?''
</P>
<P>
   Could be worse. Bradley could have made his athletic fame as a
nude skydiver.

FEDERAL DEFENDANT CAN'T SPEAK IN HIS OWN DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeatitng for all needing.)  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the 
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is
levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.) 
(gm) 
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   c. 1999 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune  
Imagine this: You're a juror in a criminal case. The defendant is
whisked into the room in a wheelchair. He's gagged. His attorney
follows. He's gagged, too. The federal government's prosecuting
attorneys are present at their table. They aren't gagged. The
prosecutors outline the case against the defendant. Neither the
defendant nor his attorney can respond to the charges _ because of
a ruling by the judge _ but the jury doesn't know why.
<TEXT>
<P>
   This isn't fiction; it isn't a scene from a Kafka novel. It's
real. Can the defendant expect justice in such a federal district
court?
</P>
<P>
   The defendant in this Kafkaesque scenario is best-selling author
and publisher Peter McWilliams. In 1996, he was diagnosed with both
AIDS and an AIDS-related cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. McWilliams
underwent chemotherapy and radiation for the cancer and a
pharmaceutical therapy for AIDS. The cancer treatment resulted in
complete remission. The AIDS treatment entails a mixture of
chemically derived protease inhibitors and anti-viral medications
in order to prevent the spread of the AIDS virus in his body. He
must continue his AIDS treatment in order to live.
</P>
<P>
   When McWilliams began his intensive treatment, he experienced
violent nausea from the moment the medications reached his stomach.
He couldn't hold them down long enough for the medicines to be
absorbed by his body.
</P>
<P>
   His doctor prescribed every anti-nausea medication available.
None worked. He vomited out his numerous pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   McWilliams might have died _ except he discovered that smoking
marijuana controlled the nausea long enough for his body to absorb
his medications. The amount of live AIDS virus in his blood dropped
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   McWilliams lives in the Los Angeles area. In 1996, California
voters passed Proposition 215, the ballot measure that allows
patients to smoke marijuana with a doctor's recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 215 also allows seriously ill patients or their
primary caregiver to grow marijuana for the patients' personal
medical purposes.
</P>
<P>
   McWilliams cultivated 300 marijuana plants for his own medical
use.
</P>
<P>
   But the federal government isn't about to let states legalize
marijuana, even for the compassionate use by serious and terminally
ill patients who find marijuana a palliative that eases their pain
and nausea.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1998, federal agents arrested McWilliams. He is
currently charged with manufacturing marijuana, conspiracy to
manufacture marijuana, and aiding and abetting the manufacturing of
marijuana. The terms of his bail were that he cannot use marijuana
to control his nausea and that he has to submit to random urine
tests.
</P>
<P>
   McWilliams stopped smoking marijuana. He now takes the
prescription anti-nausea drug, Marinol, that he claims only works
about a third of the time. He vomits up much of his AIDS
medications and, by the fall of 1998, the amount of live AIDS virus
in his blood had reached a critical stage. McWilliams can no longer
walk any further than 50 feet and uses a wheelchair. He often
sleeps 18 hours a day. All this since the arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The federal prosecutors found a friendly federal district court
judge in George H. King of the U.S. District Court of the Central
District of California. On Nov. 5, King ruled that McWilliams and
his attorney cannot use in McWilliams' defense: his medical
condition; Proposition 215; the National Institute of Medicine's
recent report on the medical usefulness of marijuana; a medical
necessity defense; nor may they mention the federal government's
own drug program which treats eight patients with marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the defendant and his attorney are to appear in
court, but they will be gagged. This sounds like a something out of
a Soviet court during the Cold War: Say anything in your defense
and you're guilty; say nothing and you're guilty.
</P>
<P>
   What has this nation come to? A defendant in a criminal trial is
prohibited from telling a jury his reasons for smoking and growing
marijuana, about the California law which is supposed to protect
medical use of marijuana, about how his health plummeted because he
can no longer use marijuana, about medical research that verifies
the medical usefulness of marijuana and about the federal
government's own marijuana program.
</P>
<P>
   McWilliams' attorney can't even tell the jury that he cannot
address some key issues and why he can't.
</P>
<P>
   McWilliams' health is failing, his publishing house of 32 years
is bankrupt and he faces 10 years in federal prison _ because he is
ill and followed California state law.
</P>
<P>
   McWilliams' attorney, Thomas J. Ballanco, says the federal
government is using his client as more than a test case: ``They're
making it a deterrence case. They want to hold this up to all the
other patients, in all the other states who might want to implement
the various state medical marijuana initiatives. And say look,
`We're still going to come after you. And we're still going to get
big prison sentences.'''
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 12, McWilliams and his attorney sat down with the
prosecution and a different judge to negotiate a guilty plea.
Nothing has been decided yet. But pivotal to any plea agreement,
according to McWilliams, is his right to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Under Judge King's restrictions, McWilliams doesn't feel he has
a chance to win in a trial: ``This is an issue that is hopeless in
a court of law, unless there is jury nullification _ unless
somehow, some way the jury found out what was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Jury nullification occurs when a jury deliberately rejects the
evidence of guilt or refuses to apply the law because it wants to
send a message about a social issue or because the result dictated
by the law is contrary to the jury's sense of justice, morality or
fairness.
</P>
<P>
   If ever there was a case in American law that justified jury
nullification, it's this one. The federal prosecutors, in this
case, have acted like shameless bullies _ pounding a sick man into
the ground. But their action is really aimed at all citizens who
may suffer from AIDS or cancer _ our parents, children, loved ones.

PAST

<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ With a badge and a gun and a loyal
following, Major Jan Zeman is back on duty 10 years after the end
of communist rule, in pursuit of lawbreakers and subversives who
threaten the social order.
</P>
<P>
   The fictional Major Zeman was the former Czechoslovakia's
favorite television police detective during communist times. But a
decision by Czech Television to re-broadcast the 1970s serial has
raised a fierce debate in the Czech Republic over whether the show
is propaganda or entertainment or history.
</P>
<P>
   Every Thursday night at 8 since its debut in mid-September,
Czechs in vast numbers have been tuning in for the next installment
of ``The 30 Cases of Major Zeman.'' The heroic, hard-nosed cop
always gets his man and every episode sends a subtle if
unmistakable message: the Communist regime, as embodied by Zeman,
is the common comrade's only friend.
</P>
<P>
   And that has former political prisoners, human rights advocates
and reform politicians upset. They're demanding that the show be
taken off the air, and accusing Czech TV of offering up
brainwashing propaganda in the guise of a historical TV
retrospective. It comes at a sensitive time when the present-day
Communist Party is enjoying a surge in support amid the country's
economic malaise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes those who worked for freedom look like criminals,
which of course was its original intent,'' complains Frantisek
Sedivy, 72, who served 12 years in prison in the 1950s and '60s for
spreading democratic ideology among fellow university students.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over whether there is a place for Major Zeman in
the post-communist era goes to the very heart of how this Central
European country, now a member of the NATO alliance, is struggling
to define its fledgling democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The television producers who decided to rebroadcast the serial _
with accompanying documentaries exploring how the show was a tool
of the regime _ say that their intent was to force this nation of
10 million to begin to come to terms with its past.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has stirred up the very questions we've been trying to
avoid,'' agrees Jiri Pehe, a Czech scholar who runs New York
University's campus in Prague.
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 17 marks the 10th anniversary of the ``Velvet Revolution,''
which overthrew communism in what was then Czechoslovakia. (In
1993, the Czech Republic and Slovakia mutually agreed to become
separate nations).
</P>
<P>
   However, the transition to a free-market economy has clearly
stalled in the Czech Republic, until a few years ago among the most
prosperous and fast-changing of the former Communist states.
Economic reforms were postponed in the mid-1990s, and the weak
Social Democratic government installed in 1997 elections has been
hamstrung by its lack of a majority in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, in the past decade, few officials of the former era
have faced trial for crimes and murders committed during the harsh,
41-year communist reign. Only five officials from the period have
been convicted in the past 10 years in the Czech Republic, while as
many as 300,000 people were jailed as political prisoners or
committed to mental institutions during communist times.
</P>
<P>
   And unrepentant Czech torturers and secret police officials have
gone so far as to form an Association for the Protection of those
Prosecuted by the Capitalistic Regime within the last few years. It
has even filed discrimination complaints with international human
rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   The public dialogue about the past has been clouded because of a
collective guilt over the crimes committed and what, if anything,
should have been done to change things sooner, according to Pehe.
``People will always tell you how the others were involved, but not
what they themselves were doing back then,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Czech TV officials regard the controversy over the show as
healthy, if not easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear to us that we have poked a wasp's nest. And we've
asked ourselves why people are so emotional about this,'' said Iva
Prochakova, a Czech TV producer who oversees the Zeman series.
``But the process of democracy-building requires us to look back at
our own past.''
</P>
<P>
   However, critics regard the airing of the series as highly
insensitive to the still-raw wounds of the hundreds of thousands
who suffered under communist rule.
</P>
<P>
   The Czech Confederation of Political Prisoners has filed a
criminal complaint in court charging that the series promotes
hatred and the ``repression of citizens' rights and freedoms.'' The
country's broadcast regulators have warned of possible fines for
spreading ``totalitarian ideology.''
</P>
<P>
   Pavel Bret, a deputy director of the Czech police's Bureau for
the Documentation and Investigation of Communist Crimes, compares
the Zeman series to the powerful and artful propaganda of Nazi
Germany. It glorifies an agent of the Communist regime which
systematically persecuted innocent people, he contends, and it
should not be on TV because the country's young democracy cannot
handle it.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 10 years we're assuming that society is more critical
and more sensitive to the objective truth about their history and
about their past. This is not the case,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The scripts, based on real-life events, were artful distortions
that portrayed the communist regime as generally benevolent and
just. The villains jousting with Zeman were often priests,
intellectuals, artists, students and Western spies. During
production, government handlers from the interior ministry oversaw
the scripts and shooting.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one episode deals with the murder of several
Communist Party officials in a conspiracy said to involve Western
spies and priests. Evidence uncovered since the fall of communism,
and included in an accompanying Zeman documentary, reveals that the
assassinations were an inside job carried out as part of a power
struggle within the communist ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with the country's economy faltering and the reform
government tainted by allegations of corruption, the opposition
Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia enjoys the support of 20
percent of the population, according to recent polls. It marks a
high point in public support for the communists since the regime
fell in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Party officials vow that if they came to power they would shift
the Czech Republic from its current capitalist course back to
socialism and seek to annul the country's membership in the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization, granted earlier this year along
Hungary and Poland.
</P>
<P>
   The airing of Zeman could hasten their return, by making
communism seem cool, say critics of the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``The population today could be influenced by this series. Those
who see the problems of today's society may think it was a better
time when they view this propaganda,'' said Jaroslav Runt, 77, a
deputy chairman of the former political prisoners confederation.
</P>
<P>
   The country's best-known former political prisoner, President
Vaclav Havel, who spent almost five years in communist jails,
dismissed the series as ``not the first nor the last idiocy aired
by Czech Television.''
</P>
<P>
   The show is as melodramatic and dated as an episode of Mannix.
Many viewers, it seems, are drawn to the show out of nostalgia for
their youth, not the politics of the time. Tuning in each week to
see Zeman's latest exploits is merely a walk down memory lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watching Zeman is kind of like putting on an old pair of boots
you've dug out of the closet,'' said Vera Kamenicka, 58, of Prague.
``They are kind of comfortable, but out of fashion.''

   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ With a badge and a gun and a loyal
following, Major Jan Zeman is back on duty 10 years after the end
of communist rule, in pursuit of lawbreakers and subversives who
threaten the social order.
</P>
<P>
   The fictional Major Zeman was the former Czechoslovakia's
favorite television police detective during communist times. But a
decision by Czech Television to re-broadcast the 1970s serial has
raised a fierce debate in the Czech Republic over whether the show
is propaganda or entertainment or history.
</P>
<P>
   Every Thursday night at 8 since its debut in mid-September,
Czechs in vast numbers have been tuning in for the next installment
of ``The 30 Cases of Major Zeman.'' The heroic, hard-nosed cop
always gets his man and every episode sends a subtle if
unmistakable message: the Communist regime, as embodied by Zeman,
is the common comrade's only friend.
</P>
<P>
   And that has former political prisoners, human rights advocates
and reform politicians upset. They're demanding that the show be
taken off the air, and accusing Czech TV of offering up
brainwashing propaganda in the guise of a historical TV
retrospective. It comes at a sensitive time when the present-day
Communist Party is enjoying a surge in support amid the country's
economic malaise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes those who worked for freedom look like criminals,
which of course was its original intent,'' complains Frantisek
Sedivy, 72, who served 12 years in prison in the 1950s and '60s for
spreading democratic ideology among fellow university students.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over whether there is a place for Major Zeman in
the post-communist era goes to the very heart of how this Central
European country, now a member of the NATO alliance, is struggling
to define its fledgling democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The television producers who decided to rebroadcast the serial _
with accompanying documentaries exploring how the show was a tool
of the regime _ say that their intent was to force this nation of
10 million to begin to come to terms with its past.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has stirred up the very questions we've been trying to
avoid,'' agrees Jiri Pehe, a Czech scholar who runs New York
University's campus in Prague.
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 17 marks the 10th anniversary of the ``Velvet Revolution,''
which overthrew communism in what was then Czechoslovakia. (In
1993, the Czech Republic and Slovakia mutually agreed to become
separate nations).
</P>
<P>
   However, the transition to a free-market economy has clearly
stalled in the Czech Republic, until a few years ago among the most
prosperous and fast-changing of the former Communist states.
Economic reforms were postponed in the mid-1990s, and the weak
Social Democratic government installed in 1997 elections has been
hamstrung by its lack of a majority in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, in the past decade, few officials of the former era
have faced trial for crimes and murders committed during the harsh,
41-year communist reign. Only five officials from the period have
been convicted in the past 10 years in the Czech Republic, while as
many as 300,000 people were jailed as political prisoners or
committed to mental institutions during communist times.
</P>
<P>
   And unrepentant Czech torturers and secret police officials have
gone so far as to form an Association for the Protection of those
Prosecuted by the Capitalistic Regime within the last few years. It
has even filed discrimination complaints with international human
rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   The public dialogue about the past has been clouded because of a
collective guilt over the crimes committed and what, if anything,
should have been done to change things sooner, according to Pehe.
``People will always tell you how the others were involved, but not
what they themselves were doing back then,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Czech TV officials regard the controversy over the show as
healthy, if not easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear to us that we have poked a wasp's nest. And we've
asked ourselves why people are so emotional about this,'' said Iva
Prochakova, a Czech TV producer who oversees the Zeman series.
``But the process of democracy-building requires us to look back at
our own past.''
</P>
<P>
   However, critics regard the airing of the series as highly
insensitive to the still-raw wounds of the hundreds of thousands
who suffered under communist rule.
</P>
<P>
   The Czech Confederation of Political Prisoners has filed a
criminal complaint in court charging that the series promotes
hatred and the ``repression of citizens' rights and freedoms.'' The
country's broadcast regulators have warned of possible fines for
spreading ``totalitarian ideology.''
</P>
<P>
   Pavel Bret, a deputy director of the Czech police's Bureau for
the Documentation and Investigation of Communist Crimes, compares
the Zeman series to the powerful and artful propaganda of Nazi
Germany. It glorifies an agent of the Communist regime which
systematically persecuted innocent people, he contends, and it
should not be on TV because the country's young democracy cannot
handle it.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 10 years we're assuming that society is more critical
and more sensitive to the objective truth about their history and
about their past. This is not the case,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The scripts, based on real-life events, were artful distortions
that portrayed the communist regime as generally benevolent and
just. The villains jousting with Zeman were often priests,
intellectuals, artists, students and Western spies. During
production, government handlers from the interior ministry oversaw
the scripts and shooting.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one episode deals with the murder of several
Communist Party officials in a conspiracy said to involve Western
spies and priests. Evidence uncovered since the fall of communism,
and included in an accompanying Zeman documentary, reveals that the
assassinations were an inside job carried out as part of a power
struggle within the communist ranks.

 &HT;    Y2K MOVIE NOT REALISTIC, BUT A HEALTHY SCARE, EXPERTS SAY
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (e) entertainment categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``Y2K: The Movie'' is an ``irresponsible'' spark
that could light a panic among many Americans. But it also could do
some good if it leads people to take sensible precautions for Jan.
1 computer glitches.
</P>
<P>
   That was the split verdict among a dozen government and industry
officials who gathered with a reporter this week to watch a preview
copy of the NBC suspense-thriller, which airs at 9 p.m. EST Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In two hours, the movie manages to hit virtually every Y2K panic
button, from planes falling from the sky to nuclear reactors
melting down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very irresponsible,'' said Delta Air Lines Captain Bill
Watts, a Y2K expert and pilot who plans to be flying Dec. 31 during
the rollover to 2000. After scribbling two pages of notes on the
technical inaccuracies in the movie, Watts declared the
aviation-related plot twists ``comical.''
</P>
<P>
   John Castagna, a spokesman for the Edison Electric Institute, a
trade group for power companies, said the movie will ``reinforce
beliefs'' among those who think Y2K will be a disaster, even though
the power outages portrayed in the movie are ``very, very
unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steve Horn, R-Calif., chairman of the House subcommittee
that studies Y2K, agreed that the script contains many implausible
scenarios, but said the movie could be ``very useful'' if it spurs
people to prepare for Y2K now, rather than at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   If too many people ignore Y2K until late December, they might
start a New Year's Eve panic at the grocery store and bank, as they
do in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of those things could happen,'' Horn said. His
subcommittee has long urged people to stock up on enough food,
water, batteries, blankets and prescriptions to last through
several days of Y2K-related disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   The movie depicts chaos spreading across the globe as the new
year moves from one time zone to the next. As midnight passes from
Asia to Europe, all sorts of computer-controlled equipment begins
to fail.
</P>
<P>
   Parisians panic as the City of Light goes dark. When 2000
arrives at New York's Times Square, throngs riot as the electric
power grid collapses along the Eastern Seaboard. Grocery stores
start rationing food and ATMs refuse to dispense cash.
</P>
<P>
   Before the long night is over, federal troops shoot and kill an
innocent man protecting his property and millions are ordered to
evacuate their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The movie stars Ken Olin, who plays a systems-failure expert
working for the federal government. The plot revolves around his
efforts to get planes out the air and water into an overheating
nuclear reactor.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the movie, alarms sound, things blow up and people
die, but the trouble-shooter stays calm. Meanwhile, Olin's wife,
children and father must wait for their hero to save the world and
get home.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with big-budget movies, the special effects seem
cheesy. Still, with an explosion of some sort between every set of
commercials, action-movie fans will find something to like.
</P>
<P>
   A disclaimer at the movie's start says it is not based on fact.
But concerns are very real about the Y2K bug, a software flaw that
exists because many older computer programs and chips recognize
only the last two digits of the year. When 2000 arrives on Jan. 1,
those computers may misinterpret ``00'' as 1900 and trigger massive
equipment malfunctions.
</P>
<P>
   In the nation's capital, government and industry representatives
have spent two years monitoring efforts to fix computers, and last
week, President Clinton said the nation's basic infrastructure
would work well throughout the date rollover.

 &HT;    LIFE IN AMERICA: Sleeping in the arms of nature
 &HT;    (Eds: This is another story in a series of reports on life in
small-town America _ the values, the stories and the characters _
at the end of the millennium. Photos and a sig/locator map are
available.
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALTO, Ga. _ I never knew a giant tree could rock a baby to
sleep, much less me. But it did.
</P>
<P>
   Yep. I slept in a tree. A 125-foot-tall tulip poplar. Her name
is Rachel. Sleeping in a tree isn't something to do when you need
your rest, but it's something unforgettable.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't alone. We were a tree ``village'' of five, each with
different reasons for being there, just as each would have
different responses to the night in Rachel's arms.
</P>
<P>
   My tree camping experience all started when
</P>
<P>
   I decided to follow Henry David Thoreau's 19th-century advice to
learn the value of a tree. Thoreau said you can't know a tree until
you have stopped to listen to it.
</P>
<P>
   I'd heard about tree climbers who spent the nights in trees, but
it wasn't until I ran into Genevieve Summers that I knew I wanted
to try it. Summers runs a North Georgia recreational and
educational tree-climbing outfit called Dancing with Trees. She
recently sold her chimney sweep business, Moonlight Sweeps, to
devote full time to her climbing program.
</P>
<P>
   On eight wooded acres in Banks County, a half-hour northeast of
Gainesville, the 48-year-old mother of two ties knots in thick
ropes with the dexterity of a seasoned sailor and swirls through
branches with the grace of a dancer.
</P>
<P>
   My first tree-climbing experience was in Tonya, a 60-year-old
white oak, who, Summers says, just named herself one evening when
Summers was sitting silently at her trunk. Whispered her name in
Summers' ear.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the heat that caused the beads of sweat to pop out on
my forehead the first time I wriggled into a harness attached to
Tonya and stepped into the foot loop secured to my ``hot rope.''
Hiking on firm ground is more my milieu.
</P>
<P>
   But Summers, who's spent as much time in trees and on rooftops
as on the ground, assured me that she had made tree climbers from
ages 4 to 76 love swinging in the trees. The only requirements are
good health and no fear of heights. I could meet those. But what I
loved was her promise that I'd never look at a tree, pick up a leaf
or listen to the wind the same way again.
</P>
<P>
   Summers can keep up with the best of male climbers, but for her,
tree climbing is more spiritual experience than sport. ``Trees,
like women, are nurturers, life givers,'' she says. She has
fashioned the country's only climbing merit badge for the northeast
Georgia Girl Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   After my initial lesson, she declared that I was ready for a
night in the trees. We agreed to put together a ``tree village,''
inviting Tom Watson, an experienced climber and arborist, and
photographer W.A. Bridges Jr., a novice climber like me.
</P>
<P>
   The date was set for the end of September, a Sunday night when
the harvest moon would be glowing.
</P>
<P>
   But when we arrived, clouds loomed in the sky. We tried not to
notice. Before the climb, Summers insisted that we share our
expectations for the night _ with one another and with the tree.
Watson talked about being a carefree boy again. Bridges said he
already felt that Tonya was his soul mate. I recalled a professor
who said that we give trees attributes that are too large for our
minds to grasp. I wanted to try to understand that.
</P>
<P>
   Then, up we went, each at our own speed with our own thoughts. I
was wet with sweat when I finally sank into my tree boat. It's an
insecure feeling at first. We'd all seen a few flashes of lightning
on our way up and told one another that the storm was far away. I
settled in, feeling snug and cozy as a soft wind made the leaves
swish against one another with rippling sounds you can't hear from
below.
</P>
<P>
   I adjusted my headlight and pulled out a book of poems I'd
stashed in my stuff-sack, ``A Timbered Choir'' by Wendell Berry.
There was a low roll of thunder in the distance. A light rain began
to fall. Summers said we should put our air mattresses on top of us
to keep from getting wet _ warning that we'd have to bail out if
the thunder got any louder.
</P>
<P>
   For a while I felt like a snail, listening to the raindrops fall
on my shell. Then, a loud thunderclap and a driving rain, and
Summers gave the call to evacuate.
</P>
<P>
   I was grateful for two things _ that I hadn't taken off my shoes
and that I knew where my gloves were. Without rubber-ribbed gloves,
rope burn is inevitable. I already had a blister from not wearing
them when I started up. In minutes, my tree boat felt like a
leaking boat.
</P>
<P>
   I was sitting in a puddle, feet dangling over the side, tossing
my air mattress, sleeping bag and pillow to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leave everything else,'' Summers yelled. ``Get down fast and
get away from the tree.'' Lightning flashed. Rain pounded. We
obeyed.
</P>
<P>
   I made the inevitable beginner's mistake, clutching the moving
knot as I descended, whizzing past Summers like George of the
Jungle. Fortunately, her safety loop stopped me, so that I had only
a bruised arm to show for my mistake.
</P>
<P>
   It was midnight when we gathered for hot tea in Summers'
kitchen, vowing to try it again. Watson said it was the first time
he'd ever had to bail out in a rainstorm in his 12 years of
climbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next time,'' Summers said, looking at Bridges and me, ``I
think you're ready for Rachel.'' Rachel, Summers' 150-year-old
friend, was named for environmentalist Rachel Carson, author of
``Silent Spring.''
</P>
<P>
   Yikes, I thought. Rachel's lowest branch is higher than we'd
just climbed.
</P>
<P>
   We gathered again on a clear October night more than a week
later. We were joined by Summers' neighbor, 24-year-old Melissa
Parham, an experienced climber eager to spend her first night in a
tree.
</P>
<P>
   Summers offered me ``the penthouse,'' but I deferred to Bridges,
knowing that photos from Rachel's crown would be important. I knew
it was the right decision for other reasons when I tackled the
single-rope technique, necessary because Rachel is too tall for
Summers' double ropes to reach the ground. Shinning up and moving
plastic ascenders seemed to require more upper-body strength. As I
struggled upward, wondering why my aerobics and weightlifting
rituals weren't paying off, I thought about my South Georgia
grandmother who decreed that girls weren't supposed to perspire.
</P>
<P>
   I stopped to rest along the way and to admire the ``resurrection
fern'' growing in Rachel's tree ``forks.'' This delicate plant can
look totally brown and dead, then spring to life in vibrant green
with the least bit of moisture.
</P>
<P>
   Once we settled in, the evening light accentuated Rachel's
angular black limbs, forming dark borders around the leaf patterns
that seemed pasted onto the sky.
</P>
<P>
   We all stopped talking, awed by the night's wonders. Summers
heard a pileated woodpecker. Her scarf, hung to one side of her
tree boat, reminded me of the prayer cloths I'd once seen tied to
trees in Soviet Georgia. An old Soviet woman told me in broken
English that the wind sent their messages to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   I read the Wendell Berry poem I'd started when the storm hit us
in Tonya:
</P>
<P>
   What do the tall trees say
</P>
<P>
   to the late havocs in the sky? They sigh.
</P>
<P>
   The air moves and they sway.
</P>
<P>
   When the breeze on the hill
</P>
<P>
   Is still, then they stand still.
</P>
<P>
   They wait.
</P>
<P>
   They have no fear.
</P>
<P>
   Their fate
</P>
<P>
   is faith. Birdsong
</P>
<P>
   Is all they've wanted all along.
</P>
<P>
   I dozed off for a while and awoke chilled. There's no way to zip
a sleeping bag in the tree, because of the rope attached to the
harness belt. I pulled the corners of the sleeping bag around me
until I was cozy again and gazed up at the autumn sky, hiding all
but a sliver of the moon. I decided to write my granddaughters a
letter about sleeping in a tree boat. Adults might think I was
crazy. But little children wouldn't. The girls, ages 5 and 6, would
squeal appropriately about my new friend, Rachel, and my adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Then I wrote a poem of my own.
</P>
<P>
   You cannot know the sky until you have seen it from a leafy
branch.
</P>
<P>
   You cannot know the night until you have listened to the leaves.
</P>
<P>
   You cannot know acorns until they have rained softly around you.
</P>
<P>
   You cannot be free until you have slept where birds take flight.
</P>
<P>
   You cannot know a tree until you have trusted your life to her
arms.
</P>
<P>
   When morning came, Summers' friend Parham was up first. She said
she'd never slept better, descended 80 feet in record time and
headed through the woods for her red pickup truck and a regular
workday at the Clarkesville Florist.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of us laid back for a leisurely breakfast: snack boxes
with cloth napkins, a bottle of orange juice made with spring
water, a fresh croissant with slices of cheese and, naturally, a
banana.
</P>
<P>
   Bridges swung around with his camera, taking pictures of all of
us stretching and eating in the morning sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   Then Summers put one last challenge to me. ``Wanna climb up to
that black cord?'' she asked, pointing to a marker about 35 feet
above. ``That's the 100-foot mark.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not, I thought, forgetting for a moment that my thighs and
arms were already sore.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a great climb and a spectacular view of the horizon.
The tree understory below, splotched with early fall reds and
yellows, was accented by the tip of an old persimmon tree laden
with orange fruit.
</P>
<P>
   When we finally descended, Summers had us share our thoughts as
we stood around Rachel's 13-foot trunk. Our comments reflected the
diverse life experiences we brought to the tree climb. Summers
talked about trees as equal partners in her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we climb a tree, we climb into ourselves,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bridges said Rachel connected him with African spiritual symbols
of peace. In the branches of the tree, he said, we were all
balanced and equal, and when we descended, we could do it only by
way of a single trunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the unity of the human race,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   I said the night was being a child again_a magical, unspoiled
adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Watson talked about the scientific miracle of fall, the way the
trees are silent on the outside but operating like giant fountains
on the inside, taking nutrients and water from root to branches. He
talked about how Rachel is shutting down the food supply to each
leaf now and storing it for spring.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Watson made a simple, eloquent observation: ``The strength
of Rachel just reminds me of faith. Faith in God.''

 &HT;    LIFE IN AMERICA: Sleeping in the arms of nature

at the end of the millennium. Photos and a sig/locator map are

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALTO, Ga. _ I never knew a giant tree could rock a baby to
sleep, much less me. But it did.
</P>
<P>
   Yep. I slept in a tree. A 125-foot-tall tulip poplar. Her name
is Rachel. Sleeping in a tree isn't something to do when you need
your rest, but it's something unforgettable.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't alone. We were a tree ``village'' of five, each with
different reasons for being there, just as each would have
different responses to the night in Rachel's arms.
</P>
<P>
   My tree camping experience all started when
</P>
<P>
   I decided to follow Henry David Thoreau's 19th-century advice to
learn the value of a tree. Thoreau said you can't know a tree until
you have stopped to listen to it.
</P>
<P>
   I'd heard about tree climbers who spent the nights in trees, but
it wasn't until I ran into Genevieve Summers that I knew I wanted
to try it. Summers runs a North Georgia recreational and
educational tree-climbing outfit called Dancing with Trees. She
recently sold her chimney sweep business, Moonlight Sweeps, to
devote full time to her climbing program.
</P>
<P>
   On eight wooded acres in Banks County, a half-hour northeast of
Gainesville, the 48-year-old mother of two ties knots in thick
ropes with the dexterity of a seasoned sailor and swirls through
branches with the grace of a dancer.
</P>
<P>
   My first tree-climbing experience was in Tonya, a 60-year-old
white oak, who, Summers says, just named herself one evening when
Summers was sitting silently at her trunk. Whispered her name in
Summers' ear.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the heat that caused the beads of sweat to pop out on
my forehead the first time I wriggled into a harness attached to
Tonya and stepped into the foot loop secured to my ``hot rope.''
Hiking on firm ground is more my milieu.
</P>
<P>
   But Summers, who's spent as much time in trees and on rooftops
as on the ground, assured me that she had made tree climbers from
ages 4 to 76 love swinging in the trees. The only requirements are
good health and no fear of heights. I could meet those. But what I
loved was her promise that I'd never look at a tree, pick up a leaf
or listen to the wind the same way again.
</P>
<P>
   Summers can keep up with the best of male climbers, but for her,
tree climbing is more spiritual experience than sport. ``Trees,
like women, are nurturers, life givers,'' she says. She has
fashioned the country's only climbing merit badge for the northeast
Georgia Girl Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   After my initial lesson, she declared that I was ready for a
night in the trees. We agreed to put together a ``tree village,''
inviting Tom Watson, an experienced climber and arborist, and
photographer W.A. Bridges Jr., a novice climber like me.
</P>
<P>
   The date was set for the end of September, a Sunday night when
the harvest moon would be glowing.
</P>
<P>
   But when we arrived, clouds loomed in the sky. We tried not to
notice. Before the climb, Summers insisted that we share our
expectations for the night _ with one another and with the tree.
Watson talked about being a carefree boy again. Bridges said he
already felt that Tonya was his soul mate. I recalled a professor
who said that we give trees attributes that are too large for our
minds to grasp. I wanted to try to understand that.
</P>
<P>
   Then, up we went, each at our own speed with our own thoughts. I
was wet with sweat when I finally sank into my tree boat. It's an
insecure feeling at first. We'd all seen a few flashes of lightning
on our way up and told one another that the storm was far away. I
settled in, feeling snug and cozy as a soft wind made the leaves
swish against one another with rippling sounds you can't hear from
below.
</P>
<P>
   I adjusted my headlight and pulled out a book of poems I'd
stashed in my stuff-sack, ``A Timbered Choir'' by Wendell Berry.
There was a low roll of thunder in the distance. A light rain began
to fall. Summers said we should put our air mattresses on top of us
to keep from getting wet _ warning that we'd have to bail out if
the thunder got any louder.
</P>
<P>
   For a while I felt like a snail, listening to the raindrops fall
on my shell. Then, a loud thunderclap and a driving rain, and
Summers gave the call to evacuate.
</P>
<P>
   I was grateful for two things _ that I hadn't taken off my shoes
and that I knew where my gloves were. Without rubber-ribbed gloves,
rope burn is inevitable. I already had a blister from not wearing
them when I started up. In minutes, my tree boat felt like a
leaking boat.
</P>
<P>
   I was sitting in a puddle, feet dangling over the side, tossing
my air mattress, sleeping bag and pillow to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leave everything else,'' Summers yelled. ``Get down fast and
get away from the tree.'' Lightning flashed. Rain pounded. We
obeyed.
</P>
<P>
   I made the inevitable beginner's mistake, clutching the moving
knot as I descended, whizzing past Summers like George of the
Jungle. Fortunately, her safety loop stopped me, so that I had only
a bruised arm to show for my mistake.
</P>
<P>
   It was midnight when we gathered for hot tea in Summers'
kitchen, vowing to try it again. Watson said it was the first time
he'd ever had to bail out in a rainstorm in his 12 years of
climbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next time,'' Summers said, looking at Bridges and me, ``I
think you're ready for Rachel.'' Rachel, Summers' 150-year-old
friend, was named for environmentalist Rachel Carson, author of
``Silent Spring.''
</P>
<P>
   Yikes, I thought. Rachel's lowest branch is higher than we'd
just climbed.
</P>
<P>
   We gathered again on a clear October night more than a week
later. We were joined by Summers' neighbor, 24-year-old Melissa
Parham, an experienced climber eager to spend her first night in a

</P>

 &HT;    Shallowness intensifies thirst for the new
 &HT;    By Jay Bookman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We are enamored of the new, fascinated by the new, addicted to
the new.
</P>
<P>
   We need new, more new, and we need it now.
</P>
<P>
   We need industrial quantities of new _ to feed those 500 cable
channels, to fill the 24-hour news broadcasts. New doesn't have to
be important; it need only be new. New trumps important every time.
</P>
<P>
   We also need new to sell more clothes to those with closets
already overflowing, more kitchen appliances to those already too
busy to cook, more electronics to people already buzzing and
beeping. Affluent consumers already own one or two of everything
conceivable; so they don't need stuff, they need new stuff.
</P>
<P>
   It is, as they say, a New Economy, and they are wiser than they
know in saying so.
</P>
<P>
   The human imagination was once enough to satisfy our taste for
new. It showed us new ways of looking at the world, new ways of
understanding ourselves and each other. But as our taste for new
became an addiction, as new became the fuel that drove the economy,
our imagination faltered under the burden. It couldn't meet demand.
The imagination is still a pure, clear spring of new, but what we
require these days is a raging river.
</P>
<P>
   So what do we do?
</P>
<P>
   We steal new from the old. We ``sample'' old songs to make new
songs. We plunder 50 years of television and a century of cinema.
We remake old movies, make sequels to old movies, re-create old
movies line for line and call them new. ESPN Classic shows old
football games, old boxing matches. And you know the ransacking of
our cultural closet is all but complete when Hollywood is down to
redoing ``George of the Jungle'' and ``Dudley Do-Right.''
</P>
<P>
   And oh yeah, roller derby and studio wrestling. It may be old to
you, but it's new to someone.
</P>
<P>
   So what do we do when we've run out of past, when the old made
new becomes old again? We rob our children.
</P>
<P>
   Kids look at the world fresh, taking it apart and putting it
back together in new combinations. It's always been a joy to see
the world through the eyes of a child.
</P>
<P>
   But now that joy is bought and sold. Corporations hire scouts to
prowl the nightclubs, the streets, the schools, the Internet sites,
trying to pick up the barest scent of something new and track it to
its source. Because these days, if you can deliver new, or even the
illusion of new, they'll make you a director, a producer, an
Internet billionaire.
</P>
<P>
   But kids produce new for a reason. They use it to define
themselves, to mark themselves as different from their parents, to
create a world and identity of their own. But everything they
invent, we adults steal and commodify, so that nothing new is
theirs for long. In their desperation to find someplace we won't
follow, some trend we won't co-opt, they turn to facial tattoos and
nipple rings, slam-dancing and violent fantasies too often made
real.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody want to follow them there?
</P>
<P>
   No? Well, maybe tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   The richest lode of new lies in Forbidden Territory, those
thoughts and ideas off-limits for hundreds if not thousands of
years, things that cultural taboos and simple good taste once
prohibited. Sex and bad language and crudity and cruelty, aspects
of our humanity that we long ago concluded were better off left
private if not buried, have become our most profitable source of
new.
</P>
<P>
   That territory used to be the domain of the artist, who would
mix small doses of the forbidden with bits of his own imagination
and use it to educate, to force us to think. Artists were
professional children, driven by instinct and vision to live on the
fringes, at the boundary between the acceptable and unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   But now that we've commodified the Forbidden, now that we've
enlisted the profit motive to exploit and deliver the Forbidden to
a mass audience, there's little room left for the artist. To go
where commerce dare not follow, the artist is reduced to dipping a
crucifix in urine or depicting the Madonna with elephant dung.
</P>
<P>
   And even Forbidden Territory turns out to be a finite resource
of new. I mean, once you've seen Dennis Rodman in a wedding dress
and read about Bill Clinton and his cigar, what else is left?
</P>
<P>
   It's interesting to speculate how we came to this dilemma. Maybe
it's because as our world has broadened, it has also grown more
shallow. Maybe, instead of close relationships with a few friends
and family, we have 300 or 400 casual acquaintances. New is what
makes that world possible; it is the coin of the realm, the
currency of our superficial conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you heard . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you see . . .?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you tried . . .?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you been to . . .?''
</P>
<P>
   And the velocity of new _ the time it takes for new to become
old _ is accelerating. Like any addict, we have to consume more and
more new to get our high. And we're running out. Our kids are
tapped out, our artists are desperate and the past is all but wrung
dry.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the past, did you hear about that 20,000-year-old
mammoth they found frozen in the Siberian permafrost? Scientists
are hoping to get enough intact DNA from the specimen to allow them
to clone it. If it works, we'll have brought an extinct species
back to life, which would be way cool.
</P>
<P>
   For about a week.

 &HT;    When all goes wrong, blame Martha Stewart
 &HT;    By Emily J. Minor
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Something ``medical'' happened to me
recently, and I'm pretty sure I'm going to have to pay for it
myself. I don't think the insurance folks have a code for what I
just lived through. It had to do with Pokemon, Y2K and Christmas
hype _ all of which I blame on Martha Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   Because she's Martha Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   What happened was this: I started to snatch things up like there
was, quite literally, no tomorrow. I began losing sleep about
whether the $89 Star Wars Legos set would be available in a month.
I started to hoard things like some of those grandmas you read
about who saved itsy-bitsy slivers of soap during the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when I was a dyed-in-the-wool lollygagger. If I
had to be at work by 10, I'd get up at 9:45. Birthday cards? I'd
stroll right to the ``Sorry I missed your . . . '' section. Library
books? Why do you think they print some notices on orange paper?
For me, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Then I started to pack lunches the night before. I cannot deny
that on many occasions I set the alarm for 5:45 so I could get up,
read the paper and iron a blouse. In retrospect, these were my
early-warning signs. Like thirst and diabetes. Then last weekend, I
found myself holding a toy-store flier advertising Furbies for
$27.99. ``LIMIT TWO,'' it said. And while I'd never given Furbies a
second thought, the mere chance of them not being available in case
I wanted one. . . Well. As I recall things now, that was the day I
was too confused to eat.
</P>
<P>
   Since I am apparently kneeling in the confessional this morning,
here's something else. During this sick, sick period in my life, I
also went around town sighing, complaining to anyone who would
listen about ``my son'' and his ``addiction to this stupid Pokemon
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, alone one day on Palm Beach _ Alone? On Palm Beach? Did
that really happen, or was I sick with Pokemon fever? _ I saw a
Pikachu alarm clock. I bought it right then and there, and if
you're not horrified yet, try this:
</P>
<P>
   I put my name on the waiting list for the Pikachu backpack.
</P>
<P>
   The adorable woman who runs the adorably expensive kids' store
assured me I was not alone in my suffering. She said crazed
grown-ups cruise through her store every weekend buying up all the
Evees and Squirtles and Charmanders. Every Monday, she is forced to
call her ``Pokemon dealer.'' When she told me that, I actually had
a whole complicated thought process about how this Pokemon thing is
such a miracle from Above because it just might wipe out all drug
sales on America's street corners. I know now that was the delirium
phase of my illness.
</P>
<P>
   The reason I am telling you this is I have to assume there are
others out there like me. After all, we all take our money out of
our wallets the same way: one fist at a time. So, if you're out
there and you're suffering, I've got the antidote.
</P>
<P>
   Go see the movie.
</P>
<P>
   It's painful. During my exorcism, I was lightheaded and
nauseous, and for a few confused moments, I felt as though I'd
broken into my plentiful stock of Y2K champagne. But I'm happy to
report that I am making good progress. I hate that little Pikachu.
I'm returning the Furbies. Recovery, however, has not been full. I
just called the adorable woman about the backpack.

 &HT;    Financial books abound
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The supply of new financial advice books is a gusher and
apparently a never-ending one.
</P>
<P>
   They are the fad books of the decade, much as do-it-yourself
books once were and feel-good, self-help books always are.
</P>
<P>
   Financial planning books are on the rise for several reasons.
One is that more and more Americans have investments. One recent
study showed that 52 percent of American households own stocks or
stock mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason is that we feel more responsible for building our
own financial future and less confident we can do it. In another
study, 45 percent of men and 53 percent of women said they worry
about having enough money for the future.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Americans are hungry for advice about their money,
and it explains why publishers keep on pumping out the books.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the books are silly or self-seeking. They might tell
you how your wealth depends on your feelings, for example, or why
you should invest in one particular kind of investment.
</P>
<P>
   But most of them are sound, and some of them are very good.
Among recent offerings, I like these three:
</P>
<P>
   ``Investing for Dummies''
</P>
<P>
   by Eric Tyson. $19.99.
</P>
<P>
   With the second edition of this yellow-covered guide for
beginners, Tyson continues his amiable nurturing of the intelligent
but untutored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember that all of us start with the same level of financial
knowledge,'' Tyson writes. ``No one is born knowing this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   He provides essays on types of investments, thinking about risk,
goal-setting and other aspects of investing.
</P>
<P>
   There are long chapters on real estate and small-business
ownership as ways of building wealth, which won't be of interest to
many readers. But the basic investing explanations are admirable.
</P>
<P>
   Strong point: Many will turn to Tyson's picks of the best in
various fields, including investment books, software, online
stockbrokers and Internet resources. His favorites among discount
brokers: T. Rowe Price (1-800-225-5132), Vanguard (1-800-992-8327)
and T.D. Waterhouse (1-800-233-3411).''Financial Fitness for Life''
</P>
<P>
   by Jerry Mason. $17.95.
</P>
<P>
   The author may not be as widely known by the public, but
financial planning professionals know him as a valuable teacher to
pros as well as beginners.
</P>
<P>
   Mason, a teacher at Texas Tech University, organized his book
around a series of classroom-style worksheets. That makes the
learning process an orderly, step-by-step process.
</P>
<P>
   That should be rewarding to people who yearn for coherence and
are willing to work for it.
</P>
<P>
   He covers the full spectrum of financial planning issues,
including basic but often overlooked issues like organizing your
files and getting the most from your employee benefits programs.
</P>
<P>
   Strong point: I admire Mason's belief in providing more
resources for the most diligent students.
</P>
<P>
   His book names more than 800 useful organizations and Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Savage Truth on Money''
</P>
<P>
   by Terry Savage. $24.95.
</P>
<P>
   Savage is a Chicago-based writer and pundit, the author of two
previous advice books and an online and television commentator
who's well-known to many people.
</P>
<P>
   Her approach emphasizes self-discipline and a commitment to
learning, and she takes the trouble to explain each point
carefully. The combination makes it easy to understand what you
need to do and why you must assume the responsibility to get it
done.
</P>
<P>
   She also provides many useful Web sites for serious students. My
favorite is her own, www.terrysavage.com, because she provides a
section in which she answers readers' questions.
</P>
<P>
   Strong point: Check out the many and often amusing variants of
just what the ``Savage truth'' is. Here's one of my favorites:
``There are two simple rules for amassing investment wealth: Spend
less than you make. Invest the difference _ both time and money _
to maximum advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Low-cost learning: tips for buying personal finance books
</P>
<P>
   _ Look for books at your local library. Personal finance books
are numbered 332 and are often in the subgroup 332.6.
</P>
<P>
   _ Buy your books at discount stores, such as Chapter 11, or on
the Internet. You could start at www.amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shop carefully. Don't fall for books that promise quick riches
or never-fail investment strategies.

 &HT;    Unstuffing Ma's shelves
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ ``You've got too much STUFF, Ma.'' That's me
explaining
</P>
<P>
   to my ex-husband's mother what's gone wrong in her living room.
She thinks maybe it's the blue lamp. The lamp is fine, I tell her,
but the rest of the place looks like a churchyard jumble sale on
Saturday morning. She's not listening.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simple, Ma, you can't jam 20 pounds of STUFF into a
10-pound room.''
</P>
<P>
   Ma doesn't pay a whole lot of attention to my wisecracks,
probably because she's been listening to me for 40 years. Right now
she's looking for solutions. I suggest Good Will. ``I'm an old
lady,'' she pretends to whine but I know her better than that _
she's joking, ``and old ladies collect STUFF. It'll happen to you
too.''
</P>
<P>
   I tell her no way, but just in case, I ask her please not to
will me that doll sitting atop the bookcase _ the one made of a
floor mop, a paper lace doily, and half a coat hanger.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I have to save all of this STUFF,'' she says in an effort
to justify her junk. ``What if folks come to visit and the STUFF
they gave me is gone?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Simple,'' I explain. ``Tell 'em you're getting forgetful and
you put it away so the great-grandchildren wouldn't break it, and
now you've forgotten where it is.'' Ma grabs a red-enameled wooden
horse she bought in Sweden and takes a playful swing at me with it.
But that reminds her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got this camel in Egypt,'' she says picking up a carved
figure from a cluttered shelf. I ask where the half-nekkid guy, the
one behind the crystal beer stein full of matchbooks came from. She
says Maui. And the elephant with a missing leg? Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you fix the bookcase?'' she wants to know. I tell her I
can but the surgery is going to be merciless. She looks away,
thinks for a moment, and gives me the green light. She even hauls
in a couple of empty packing boxes from the back porch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll empty the shelves and stack stuff on the floor,'' I tell
her, ``and then you can go through and determine which STUFF to
keep and what to pitch.'' She nods but I can tell her heart isn't
in it. I dig in and she starts to sort. The floor is filling up
fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gotta' save this,'' I hear her mutter. It's a do-it-yourself
electrical wiring book.
</P>
<P>
   ``You planning on rewiring the house, Ma?'' I ask. She says that
was a couple of years ago when she was younger (81). ``And what
about this thing?''
</P>
<P>
   ``What thing?'' she asks without looking up from her sorting.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing that looks like half-a-lava lamp.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's half-a-lava lamp,'' she affirms, and as soon as I find
the other half, I'll have a whole one. I hear they're back in
style.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What about these boxes of jigsaw puzzles marked: Pieces
missing?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep those. Can't tell when the missing pieces might turn
up.'' I ask how long they've been like this and she says since her
boys were little. I calculate that to be about 50 years and start
unloading the next shelf.
</P>
<P>
   There's an 1868 hymnal from the old German Lutheran church,
school books
</P>
<P>
   from the mid-1800s, in German, and Grandma Baker's collection of
leather postcards. In another stack is a daguerreotype of my late
father-in-law's father in his Prussian army uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Folded in four and stuck in an 1887 geography book is the Dec.
8, 1941
</P>
<P>
   front page of the Toledo Blade announcing we were at war with
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   A baby picture of Ma's firstborn, my ex-husband, wearing a
scalloped bonnet and screaming his lungs out, rests under the rock
our son Kristofor mailed to his grandmother from camp when he was
10.
</P>
<P>
   On the shelf above is a November 1911 Redbook Magazine. American
Radiator Company in Chicago is advertising that for $125 it can fit
a cottage with an IDEAL boiler and 175 feet of 38-inch American
radiators. American Telephone and Telegraph boasts 12 million miles
of wire and 20 million calls daily. A Hamilton railroad watch costs
$38.50, and a can of Campbell's soup (21 kinds), a dime.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some neat STUFF here,'' I confess. Ma says she already
knew that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right, but the featherless badminton bird goes, OK?'' She
agrees.
</P>
<P>
   Now we're getting somewhere.

 &HT;    Toast stew, taco glue: Top that, readers
 &HT;    By Ron Wiggins
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ My First Annual Food Invention and Weird
Snacks Contest starts NOW! with a wink and a nod of gratitude to
the Spencer family of Wellington, Fla., for their inspiring letter:
</P>
<P>
   Dear Ron,
</P>
<P>
   My family and I love to sit around the dinner table thinking of
great food inventions. Our all-time favorite is taco glue.
</P>
<P>
   Taco glue would also be great for burritos. You know how
frustrating it is when your soft taco or burrito starts unwinding
and losing its stuffing. My husband, Marc, also thought that hard
tacos would be great if they had spring-loaded hinges on them. That
way, no matter how much you stuffed in it, it would not crack.
</P>
<P>
   The Spencers (Jody, Marc, Alex, Paige and Austin)
</P>
<P>
   I salute the Spencers for addressing the structurally unsound
burrito problem.
</P>
<P>
   Not only should burrito glue be developed at once, Taco Bell
should throw in a soft tortilla patch kit with a packet of glue for
those inevitable burrito grande ruptures and the tragic loss of
sour cream and guacamole. I also commend Taco Bell for pioneering
the hard taco inside a soft taco for that unique crunch-with-squish
mouth feel.
</P>
<P>
   But back to my food invention and weird snack contest. It has
long been my contention that every kitchen is a food laboratory at
some time or another and that many a delectable food concoction
could be found between the sofa cushions of America if only folks
would own up to their offbeat food inventions. It is time to
celebrate twisted kitchen creations.
</P>
<P>
   Send me snack recipes you have invented or know about, or tell
me a food that should be invented. An example of the latter would
be a leakproof, enveloping hot dog bun that you could fill with
mustard, catsup and pureed jalapenos. Jot down those unlikely food
combinations, mail or e-mail them to me and you could win an invite
to the taste-off party.
</P>
<P>
   First, second and third places will win something really neat.
Don't press me, I haven't decided.
</P>
<P>
   To get your creative and digestive juices flowing, I will offer
some food creations I've come across over the years:
</P>
<P>
   Vernor's Ginger Ale and Bosco: A Detroit inner-city favorite.
Spoon Bosco chocolate syrup into Vernor's and for reasons unknown
to chemistry, it tastes like chocolate-covered cherries.
</P>
<P>
   Mock Angel Cake: I'm sorry to have lost the name of the
contributor, but I remember the recipe well. Take stale bread and
sop both sides in sweetened condensed milk. Flop bread in copious
amounts of shredded coconut and grill both sides in butter until
coconut is golden brown. Your fillings will sing you to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Toast Stew: Heat a can of condensed vegetable beef soup. Add
chunks of cheddar and Worcestershire to taste. As cheese melts,
drop torn pieces of toast in bowl and devour.
</P>
<P>
   Lightning Fast Popcorn Balls Without Bothering to Form Them Into
Balls: Before my metabolism took out a contract on my life, I
invented this snack and consumed with impunity. Put butter and
brown sugar in a bowl that you wouldn't mind seeing turned into a
carbonized black lump. Add a teaspoon of vanilla. Put in microwave
and heat for 30 seconds. The contents will boil up into a
caramelized froth and subside into a thin golden liquid. Drizzle
liquid over a bowl of popcorn and eat until nauseous. Warning: If
you microwave too long, don't even bother with the oven EZ-Off.
Throw away the microwave and buy another.
</P>
<P>
   Popcorn Cheese-drizzle: When I told my good friend and fellow
motorcycle enthusiast C.R. of Lantana about the caramel popcorn
trick, she said you can do the same thing with grated cheddar and
butter. Heat until soupy, drizzle on popcorn and park in front of
the TV.
</P>
<P>
   Gorilla Bob's Cheapskate Souffle, courtesy of Bob Weintraub,
West Palm Beach motorcycle shop owner: Stir a couple of eggs into a
cup of cooked rice. Toss in garlic, onion, maybe a little oregano,
cook omelette style, and you're in heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Andre's Dessert Omelette: I can't remember the local chef's last
name, but his confection passed on to me 20 years ago was pure
genius. Make an unflavored omelette, folding in Smucker's blueberry
jam. Top with powdered sugar and place under broiler just long
enough to melt sugar. In separate pan, heat a few ounces of
100-proof rum, light and let flame die down somewhat before pouring
remaining flaming liquid over omelette. Serve while on fire. You
know what I mean.
</P>
<P>
   Ruined Strawberries and Cream: I gave it that name as a warning.
A colleague assures me that the truly tasty way to serve sliced
strawberries mounded with slightly sweetened whipped cream is to
grind fresh pepper over the cream.
</P>
<P>
   Don't send me your S'mores recipe. I know about S'mores. Been
there, eaten that.
</P>
<P>
   Send your Weird Snacks (or fun food innovations) to Ron Wiggins,
Box 24700 West Palm Beach, Fla. 33416-4700. Or email me at
ronwiggins(at)pbpost.com Contest deadline is Nov. 20.

 &HT;    Proposed university 'riot fee' gives new meaning to
'extracurricular'
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Either a University of Colorado regent is taking
group punishment to the extreme, or he's hit on a new dimension in
campus life.
</P>
<P>
   We make rioting a club sport.
</P>
<P>
   Someday a varsity sport?
</P>
<P>
   A pro brawler's tour, maybe?
</P>
<P>
   Champion crowned at the Super Brawl?
</P>
<P>
   We can't be sure what regent Jim Martin was thinking. Maybe he
will give it some more thought. Maybe he ought to.
</P>
<P>
   In light of what has become a too-regular occurrence in the
college town of Boulder _ a Halloween-weekend riot _ Martin
proposed a mandatory student fee to raise $100,000 to pay for
annual damages.
</P>
<P>
   With 25,000 students, that would be $4 apiece. Students
naturally have assailed the proposal. I have to agree. Group
punishment is for cretins.
</P>
<P>
   And there's no way to know, short of chromosomal testing, how
many CU students are trash-can lighting, vehicle-overturning
out-of-control cretins and how many are there just to find meaning
in life.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the thoughtful CU junior quoted in a Boulder
publication lamenting how tough it is in '90s to find incitement:
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '50s we had racism, in the '60s we had Vietnam. In the
'90s we don't have anything to get angry about.''
</P>
<P>
   Personally, if I were a student and the college attached a $4
riot fee to my tuition, the first thing I'd do is riot.
</P>
<P>
   I'd want something for my money.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe there are wiley designs behind an idea that sounds so
dumb. The students obviously don't see the benefits inherent. Maybe
what the regent has in mind is making rioting an entitlement and a
campus-sponsored activity.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. Rather than prohibit rioting, charge a student fee
and institutionalize it. List it in the student catalog. And watch
participation sag.
</P>
<P>
   That is, except for those who are truly devoted and skilled at
rioting. They would continue to pursue their passion. With a
$100,000 annual fund bolstering their activities, riots could be
held in venues _ intramural fields first, stadiums next. Call in
corporate sponsors. Miller beer. Zima. Clearasil.
</P>
<P>
   It would be no time before ESPN2 or MTV decided to televise. Put
an ``X'' before the event and you've got something with staying
power. The X-pletive Games. The X-crement Games.
</P>
<P>
   Young people could go to college and pursue rioting specialties
to take on the pro tour. Mini-van overturning. Recreational arson.
Low-impact looting.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado U. should consider these opportunities to bolster its
more traditional sports. For a few years its football team had a
reputation for law-breaking, despite the Bible-thumping of its
former coach. If the university can institutionalize rioting, it
can recruit multi-sport talents, like Florida State speed demon
Peter Warrick, who recently pleaded guilty to a theft charge and
was sped back onto the football field.
</P>
<P>
   Under traditional standards Warrick would be considered an
embarrassment and disgrace. But if college campuses can
institutionalize rioting, looting and theft, someone like Warrick
can simply come to school as a two-sport star.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of criticizing the CU regent, students should be
taking him up on his suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Fight Club'' _ about an underground organization of
disillusioned young men who get together and beat each other into
flank steaks _ is good enough for Brad Pitt, then a Riot Club is
good enough to have its own cubicle at the Student Center.
</P>
<P>
   The university quickly would realize that a $4 riot fee is a
bargain when a first-run movie costs $7. So instead of complaining,
students should enjoy themselves at this low, low rate. They should
know that the cost of higher education will go up.

 &HT;    Financial books abound
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The supply of new financial advice books is a gusher and
apparently a never-ending one.
</P>
<P>
   They are the fad books of the decade, much as do-it-yourself
books once were and feel-good, self-help books always are.
</P>
<P>
   Financial planning books are on the rise for several reasons.
One is that more and more Americans have investments. One recent
study showed that 52 percent of American households own stocks or
stock mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason is that we feel more responsible for building our
own financial future and less confident we can do it. In another
study, 45 percent of men and 53 percent of women said they worry
about having enough money for the future.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Americans are hungry for advice about their money,
and it explains why publishers keep on pumping out the books.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the books are silly or self-seeking. They might tell
you how your wealth depends on your feelings, for example, or why
you should invest in one particular kind of investment.
</P>
<P>
   But most of them are sound, and some of them are very good.
Among recent offerings, I like these three:
</P>
<P>
   ``Investing for Dummies''
</P>
<P>
   by Eric Tyson. $19.99.
</P>
<P>
   With the second edition of this yellow-covered guide for
beginners, Tyson continues his amiable nurturing of the intelligent
but untutored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember that all of us start with the same level of financial
knowledge,'' Tyson writes. ``No one is born knowing this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   He provides essays on types of investments, thinking about risk,
goal-setting and other aspects of investing.
</P>
<P>
   There are long chapters on real estate and small-business
ownership as ways of building wealth, which won't be of interest to
many readers. But the basic investing explanations are admirable.
</P>
<P>
   Strong point: Many will turn to Tyson's picks of the best in
various fields, including investment books, software, online
stockbrokers and Internet resources. His favorites among discount
brokers: T. Rowe Price (1-800-225-5132), Vanguard (1-800-992-8327)
and T.D. Waterhouse (1-800-233-3411).''Financial Fitness for Life''
</P>
<P>
   by Jerry Mason. $17.95.
</P>
<P>
   The author may not be as widely known by the public, but
financial planning professionals know him as a valuable teacher to
pros as well as beginners.
</P>
<P>
   Mason, a teacher at Texas Tech University, organized his book
around a series of classroom-style worksheets. That makes the
learning process an orderly, step-by-step process.
</P>
<P>
   That should be rewarding to people who yearn for coherence and
are willing to work for it.
</P>
<P>
   He covers the full spectrum of financial planning issues,
including basic but often overlooked issues like organizing your
files and getting the most from your employee benefits programs.
</P>
<P>
   Strong point: I admire Mason's belief in providing more
resources for the most diligent students.
</P>
<P>
   His book names more than 800 useful organizations and Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Savage Truth on Money''
</P>
<P>
   by Terry Savage. $24.95.
</P>
<P>
   Savage is a Chicago-based writer and pundit, the author of two
previous advice books and an online and television commentator
who's well-known to many people.
</P>
<P>
   Her approach emphasizes self-discipline and a commitment to
learning, and she takes the trouble to explain each point
carefully. The combination makes it easy to understand what you
need to do and why you must assume the responsibility to get it
done.
</P>
<P>
   She also provides many useful Web sites for serious students. My
favorite is her own, www.terrysavage.com, because she provides a
section in which she answers readers' questions.
</P>
<P>
   Strong point: Check out the many and often amusing variants of
just what the ``Savage truth'' is. Here's one of my favorites:
``There are two simple rules for amassing investment wealth: Spend
less than you make. Invest the difference _ both time and money _
to maximum advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Low-cost learning: tips for buying personal finance books
</P>
<P>
   _ Look for books at your local library. Personal finance books
are numbered 332 and are often in the subgroup 332.6.
</P>
<P>
   _ Buy your books at discount stores, such as Chapter 11, or on
the Internet. You could start at www.amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shop carefully. Don't fall for books that promise quick riches
or never-fail investment strategies.

 &HT;    Artist Hibel moved by 'purest love'
 &HT;    By Loretta Grantham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The wall is pink, but a patch of
sky-blue paint peeks out. Just a tiny bit, around the light switch
in one of Edna Hibel's bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Edna Hibel. One of America's most prolific and commercially
successful artists. A celebrated woman whose work can command as
much as 100 grand a canvas. A tireless taskmaster who rises at 5
a.m., eager for her easel.
</P>
<P>
   Yet she can't slap a solid coat of latex on a bedroom wall.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, it's funny. Ironic even. But once you get to
know her, you'll understand.
</P>
<P>
   A wall has no soul. People do.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what Edna Hibel lives for _ to capture the human
spirit.
</P>
<P>
   A Portuguese mother and child. A Russian woman in a kerchief. A
bearded Japanese farmer. Ballerinas and beggars, peasants and
kings, families and loners, and then some. All painted or sketched
with soft edges, never hard lines.
</P>
<P>
   They are, Hibel says, her ``children.''
</P>
<P>
   And she tends to them while perched beside a plate-glass window
overlooking her back yard so that she can make the most of natural
light. But because the artist, 82, dampens her first brush before
dawn, fluorescent tubes in the ceiling have to suffice until
sunrise.
</P>
<P>
   The Singer Island home she shares with her husband of 58 years,
Theodore ``Tod'' Plotkin, also 82, is a modest retreat with
pea-soup green carpet, pecky cypress paneling, bright yellow
kitchen cabinets and no house number.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone needs to know what it is,'' Hibel says, laughing,
``I'll run out and stick a sign in the yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Think grandma's with lots of neat stuff to look at: china- and
wax-faced dolls in frilly floral frocks, three plaster Greek
sculpture replicas that Hibel's mom nabbed for a dollar each when
an art school went under, an old-timey heavy-as-lead metal cash
register with $1.80 popped up in the window.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not even counting Hibel's studio _ built on to the
back of the house _ which bulges with art books and supplies;
filing cabinets; paintbrushes in tarnished trophy cups (including
one she won in a 1937 tennis tournament); and unfinished creations.
</P>
<P>
   Miles of unfinished creations.
</P>
<P>
   That's because she'll dabble on one painting, put it down and
dabble on another. And another. Amazingly, she keeps track, never
fretting about what needs to be done when.
</P>
<P>
   Taking it one day at a time until she quits around 5 p.m.
Working on the same easel she's had for 60 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feel free to poke around,'' she says, not the least bit
overprotective of her lair, packed with propped-up canvases worth
thousands of dollars. ``I'd apologize for the clutter, but it never
looks any different.''
</P>
<P>
   Hibel's artistic prowess first became apparent to her mom, Lena,
who indulged her only daughter at an art store in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``She would say, `I have a talented kid, what shall I get her?'
and they'd sell her everything. That store must've thought I was
the most spoiled kid they ever met.''
</P>
<P>
   But she doesn't appear to be a spoiled adult. Far from it.
</P>
<P>
   She carries a cloth purse with a zebra on it, not a designer
label. She drives a burgundy Buick, not a Benz. And she doesn't
sport a chunky diamond _ or any wedding ring at all, for that
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shake hands so much that the ring started to hurt,'' she
says, explaining why her band is tucked away. ``I switched it to
the right hand, but that didn't work either.''
</P>
<P>
   Hibel, although unassuming, is occasionally recognized by Singer
Island townsfolk, who'll sheepishly ask for her autograph. Just the
other day at a beachside restaurant, in fact, a fawning real estate
agent came over and announced that she owned ``several Hibels.''
</P>
<P>
   The artist shook her hand.
</P>
<P>
   Hibel's only sibling _ a younger brother, William, who retired
10 years ago after working for his sister's company _ also lives on
the island.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy and I were both brought up to think we were wonderful.
Anything we wanted to do, our parents loved and encouraged.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Edna loved painting, and her mother certainly encouraged
it, but she didn't want to do it for a living.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to grow up and run an orphanage because I'd read
Little Women,'' she recalls with a smile. ``I remember playing with
other children _ we lived in an apartment building _ and I'd make
all those kids lie on the stairs and be my orphans.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, she started making 15-minute ``sitting''
appointments with those kids so she could paint them. She was 13,
the same age as her father, Abraham, when he immigrated to the
States in 1911.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother and father got married as teenagers and had nothing.
My father told me that when he was 5 or 6 in Poland, he'd think
about America and how it was filled with flowers and butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never lost that feeling of wonderment and optimism, and I
got that from him. He felt like that till he died.''
</P>
<P>
   Abraham, who became a successful furrier, died in 1960. His
wife, Lena, died 28 years later, one week before her 90th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   The artist credits Lena for her relentless attention to detail
(''if your hem was this much off, Mother would notice''), a quality
that contributed to Hibel's acceptance at the Boston Museum of Fine
Arts School in 1934.
</P>
<P>
   It was there that she made her first sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another student, an older woman, stopped me in the corridor
and said, 'Are you Edna Hibel? I'd like to buy that painting in the
design room.' I said, 'Oh, no. You can have it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``She insisted on paying, so I said, `Would $5 be too much?' and
she said, `Don't be silly. It should be at least twice that.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 17, and she wrote me a check for $10. I could've
fainted. Imagine getting paid for something you were born to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting paid would eventually come in handy.
</P>
<P>
   In a big way.
</P>
<P>
   Tod Plotkin, a Harvard grad, helped run an upscale women's
department store in Boston founded by his father. But, due to
soaring downtown rent and sprawling chains, Plotkin Brothers closed
in the late '50s.
</P>
<P>
   Hibel, meanwhile, had been a full-time mom who painted in the
attic and taught art lessons before the couple's three boys _ Jon,
Richard and Andy _ got home from school.
</P>
<P>
   Her work was often featured in exhibitions around the country,
but now it was time for Hibel to put the money where her palette
was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never thought of myself as an `artist,' and next thing I
know, my work had to pay the bills. That's when I became an
`artist.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Tod had such faith. He said, `Well, we have this great talent
between us: YOU. Let's do the best we can and see what happens.'
</P>
<P>
   ``From the moment he started working with me _ and by that I
mean driving the kids and doing the shopping and making the frames
so I could paint all day _ that was when everything took off.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, the first Hibel gallery opened in Rockport, Mass., with
Lena Hibel at the helm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The paintings ran from $50 to $150, and Mother said, `I'm
never going to have the nerve to ask that much.' Tod said, `Fine.
You can give a painting away, but you can't sell it for less than
the price.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``The first day she calls Tod and says, `Please. There's a
couple in here that wants a $50 painting for $25. They're so nice.'
He said, `Looks like you're going to have to give it away then.'
Well, he knew she wasn't about to do that. So she demanded $50 and
got it. After that, she was hooked.''
</P>
<P>
   It was at the Rockport gallery that Hibel's most devoted patrons
_ Ethelbelle and Clayton Craig, then head of the Christian Science
Church _ bought their first paintings. They would eventually own
more than 300.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an indefinable something in Edna's paintings and
drawings that attracted us to her work,'' Clayton Craig once said.
``We couldn't put our fingers on this quality until we met her.
It's her character. Her great love of people _ all people _ which
she expresses in every painting, drawing or lithograph.''
</P>
<P>
   Hibel's ``something'' lured other collectors, too, and more
galleries followed: Boston, Naples, Miami and, in 1968, Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weather up North just didn't agree with my mother,'' Hibel
says, explaining why the family moved to Florida in the '70s.
``Plus, we had trouble shipping out of Boston in the winter because
of the snow. I used to say I'd only paint on sunny days because of
the light, but I couldn't very well do that in Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palm Beach gallery moved from Worth Avenue to Royal
Poinciana Plaza, and a museum was added in 1977. In January, the
Hibel Museum of Art announced it will move to a $1.8 million
building on the Florida Atlantic University campus in Abacoa, a
Jupiter development.
</P>
<P>
   The museum, scheduled to open in 2001, will sell Hibel's artwork
_ paintings, dolls, lithographs, plates and prints _ as well as
showcase the Craigs' extensive collection. Meanwhile, starting next
month, the nonprofit Edna Hibel Art Foundation will display her
work in the former Roberts Auction House in Lake Worth. (All other
galleries have closed.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We were so worried at first when Tod lost the business, but it
turned out to be the best thing,'' says Hibel, referring to her
husband, who _ to this day _ drives to work each morning to oversee
Hibel's wholesale distribution warehouse in Mangonia Park, along
with the couple's son, Andy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't for that, I'd probably still be painting in an
attic,'' she jokes. ``Of course, I later graduated to downstairs
when my oldest son got married. I took over his bedroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Edna Hibel isn't about the money. And she can't explain how a
painting is priced.
</P>
<P>
   Deep down, she'd still rather give her stuff away. Just like
when she was in art school.
</P>
<P>
   ``That isn't my department,'' she explains. ``But if you charge
one price and people pay it, and you go up a little and people
still pay, well, I guess you just keep going up a little. I know my
things go for a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed they do, at least for paintings, which run from $5,000 to
20 times that.
</P>
<P>
   There are affordable items, too. Like lithographs, $150 and up.
Prints, from $50 to $1,000. Plates, between $30 and $300. Dolls,
$150 (assembled overseas) to $2,500 (handmade by local
seamstresses).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful feeling that people want to pay their good
money for something I believe in,'' she says. ``For the way that I
express what I see in humanity: integrity, beauty and love.''
</P>
<P>
   She jokes that, yes, she makes a lot of money, but doesn't have
a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give it away,'' she says, referring to numerous charities,
scholarship funds and family.
</P>
<P>
   Her son, Andy, 52, is executive trustee of the Hibel Museum and
lives in Palm Beach Gardens. Meanwhile, Jon, 58, owns a home around
the corner from his parents on Singer Island. (He and his wife
produce mystery theater shows.) And Richard, 49, runs an art
gallery in Hyannisport, Mass. There are five grandchildren, and
Hibel hopes for a great-grandchild soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to be pushy about it,'' she says with a wink.
</P>
<P>
   Hibel doesn't seem to be pushy about anything. Perhaps that's
why she's so soothing to be around. She listens intently when you
speak, never losing eye contact. And you can tell _ even if she's
just met you _ that she cares about what you're saying.
</P>
<P>
   You know she's itching to get back to her easel, but for her,
people come first.
</P>
<P>
   The real ones, not the ones on canvas.
</P>
<P>
   ``People tell me that when they look at one of my paintings,
they feel like they know me. That they're a better person for
having seen it. But I tell them the truth is, they were a fine
person to begin with. What my paintings bring out is what's already
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Each and every day, Hibel yearns to bring out more _ in herself
and those around her.
</P>
<P>
   She admits, at 82, that time is precious. But she doesn't rush.
</P>
<P>
   One stroke at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I open my eyes, the first thing I want to do is get to
work,'' she says. ``I'm not nervous about it. I just love doing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Painting is like breathing to me.''

 &HT;    NUTS &AMP; BOLTS: Now's time to increase attic's R-value
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was in my attic the other day, checking out the energy
efficiency, and I figure I have about half as much insulation as I
need.
</P>
<P>
   I live in a two-story house built more than 60 years ago, and
the attic has a little more than five inches of blown cellulose
insulation over the floor. That gives me an insulation R-value of
about 19, while the U.S. Department of Energy's recommended attic
insulation for our climate is R-38.
</P>
<P>
   R-value is a measure of an insulating material's resistance to
heat transmission: the higher the value, the more effective the
insulation. An R-38 rating requires about 13 inches of fiberglass
insulation or 11 inches of loose cellulose.
</P>
<P>
   If, like me, you need to upgrade your attic insulation, now's a
good time to get the job done. It typically won't take more than an
afternoon, and, at this time of year, it's neither too hot nor too
cold to work in the attic.
</P>
<P>
   Adding attic insulation is one of the easiest and most effective
ways to lower your home heating and cooling bills and to increase
the comfort level of your house.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCTS TO USE FOR ATTIC INSULATION
</P>
<P>
   If your attic floor has no insulation, start by installing a
vapor barrier. A vapor barrier can be a paper or foil facing on a
roll of insulation material or a sheet of plastic.
</P>
<P>
   The vapor barrier is placed against the ceiling of the room
below the attic and prevents moisture from the heated areas of the
house from migrating into the insulation, where it can damage the
insulation or boards in the attic structure.
</P>
<P>
   Some insulation products come in rolls with a vapor barrier,
typically craft paper, on one side. If you're using such a roll,
remember that the paper barrier goes right against the warm room
being insulated. In an attic, that means the barrier is face-down
between the floor joists and directly against the plaster or
wallboard of the ceiling underneath.
</P>
<P>
   If a vapor barrier and insulation already are in place, you can
add insulation over the existing layers to increase the R-value.
</P>
<P>
   The two types of insulation you'll see most of in hardware and
home improvement stores is fiberglass fiber and loose cellulose.
Each product has advantages and disadvantages.
</P>
<P>
   People I've talked to who have worked with both say cellulose is
usually faster and easier than fiberglass rolls. Cellulose, though,
has to be blown into place with special equipment, and it creates a
lot of dust.
</P>
<P>
   Cellulose is made of shredded recycled paper that has been
treated with chemicals to help it resist fire, insects and mildew.
It's fairly cheap, and you can buy enough loose cellulose
insulating material to add about R-19 of insulation on 1,000 square
feet for about $125. Most home-improvement stores will loan a
blower for a few hours for free if you buy cellulose from them.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Energy says homeowners using blown cellulose
should keep in mind that the product settles after it is applied.
To get a 10-in layer of cellulose, you might have to blow in about
12 inches. The package the cellulose comes in should tell you how
much the brand you are using compacts.
</P>
<P>
   Loose cellulose insulation can also be used to add insulation to
a house's outside walls if their insulation is currently less than
R-11. The job involves drilling through outside walls and plugging
the holes later. Research thoroughly before attempting such a
project. You might want to consider hiring a professional.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular form of fiberglass insulation comes in rolls
wrapped in thin plastic that reduces some of the skin irritation
associated with working with fiberglass.
</P>
<P>
   When building new houses, fiberglass insulation is usually the
top choice. It's easy to tack or staple rolls of fiberglass
insulation between wall studs and floor joists before the walls and
floors are installed.
</P>
<P>
   But fiberglass rolls also can be rolled between or across joists
in an existing attic. The rolls stay where you put them better than
blown cellulose, but using the rolls requires some measuring and
cutting.
</P>
<P>
   If you comparison shop, you probably can buy enough rolled
fiberglass insulation to add about R-25 in insulating value in a
1,000-square-foot attic for $300 to $350.
</P>
<P>
   INSTALLATION TIPS FOR DO-IT-YOURSELFERS
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  No matter what kind of insulation you're working with, it's a
good idea to wear gloves, goggles, a loose-fitting, long-sleeved
shirt and a breathing mask.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't insulate over ventilation airways.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Keep the insulation materials away from electric fixtures.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't step between attic floor joists.
</P>
<P>
   In a well-ventilated attic, air flows in naturally from the area
under the eaves and exits near the apex of the roof. If you
insulate over air inlets at the eaves, you can create serious
overheating in the attic.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly if you're using blown cellulose insulation, make
sure you protect ventilation air paths before adding insulation.
The stores that sell insulation also should sell plastic baffles
that provide an air path around insulation materials.
</P>
<P>
   Recessed light fixtures in the ceilings of rooms produce enough
heat to be dangerous if insulating materials get too close.
Maintain the clearance recommended by the manufacturers of the
light fixtures and insulation you are using.
</P>
<P>
   The ceilings in your living areas were not designed to hold much
weight. If you accidently step between the joists _ those boards
set on edge across your attic floor _ you could break through the
ceiling below, resulting in a costly repair.
</P>
<P>
   A sheet of plywood laid across the joists makes a good platform
for working in the attic.
</P>
<P>

   MONEYTALK _ Financial planning books are on the rise for several
reasons. One is that more and more Americans have investments. One
recent study showed that 52 percent of American households own
stocks or stock mutual funds. Another reason is that we feel more
responsible for building our own financial future and less
confident we can do it. In another study, 45 percent of men and 53
percent of women said they worry about having enough money for the
future. But most of them are sound, and some of them are very good.

<P>
   CONTEMPORARY _ ATLANTA _ Atlanta's influx of new people from all
parts of the world is bringing some big changes in the way
Atlantans furnish their homes. In a market once dominated by
traditional tastes _ contemporary furnishing is making noteworthy
inroads. Driving it, designers said, are a number of factors _
fashion trends, mass media design exposure, a nostalgic recall of
classic lines as a new century looms, a strong economy ripe for
risk taking, the home invasion of technology. So what is
contemporary? Think clean lines, light woods, satin metals, natural
fabric and earth colors. (Flanders, Atlanta Journal-Constitution.)

insulation is one of the easiest and most effective ways to lower
your home heating and cooling bills and to increase the comfort
level of your house. (Cummings, Dayton Daily News). 26. MOVED.

 &HT;    Math teachers: You pushed Practical Man's buttons
 &HT;    By The Practical Man
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Editor's note: Longing to win a fight with the spouse? Need
reassurance that your boss/condo president/irritating neighbor is _
how to put this delicately _ a knucklehead? Send your dilemmas to
Practical Man, Accent's appointed hero for a new millennium.
(Motto? He's so right you just want to smack him!)
</P>
<P>
   The practical man has a bone to pick with teachers.
</P>
<P>
   His sixth-grade son came home with a very special surprise last
week.
</P>
<P>
   An F.
</P>
<P>
   On a math test.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the love of God, boy!'' bellowed the practical man. ``What
do you mean by this?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get math.''
</P>
<P>
   The practical man reeled, wobbled, then sat down. He'd heard
about people who ``aren't any good at math,'' but his son could not
possibly be one of them.
</P>
<P>
   He huddled with his child. He went over the test line by line.
His heart sank. It looked like 10 minutes' work for anyone over age
9. His 11-year-old boy had spent an hour on it and scored 44.
</P>
<P>
   ``Number 7,'' the practical man said. ``What's 10 percent of 65?
How'd you come up with 23?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me get my calculator.''
</P>
<P>
   The practical man chuckled in disbelief. ``You don't need a
calculator for that, son. Do it in your head.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to have my calculator.''
</P>
<P>
   And here, teachers, is where you come in. Because in the eyes of
Practical Man Jr., the test wasn't about math at all. It was about
calculators, which are required for all kids in his class. He had
no idea what percent means, didn't have an inkling that there was
an idea behind the % sign on his junky little gizmo. To him, math
was memorizing a correct sequence of keystrokes.
</P>
<P>
   The practical man straightened him out in short order.
</P>
<P>
   Then he got angry. What was a sixth-grader doing with a
calculator in math class? Shortcuts are not for kids. For anyone
who hasn't traveled the hard road, they inevitably lead to helpless
stupidity. You become the computer dolt who twiddles his thumbs and
calls tech support when his icons disappear. Or the dorm doofus who
lives on potato chips when the microwave dies. Or the boy who
wrings his hands and whimpers over an F because he's been taught
only how to push buttons, not how to think.
</P>
<P>
   The practical man never thought he'd have to say this to math
teachers, but come on. Get practical!
</P>
<P>
   Now, on to the mail.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Practical Man: You're absolutely correct in writing that a
practical man would not keep fish or birds. And practical man
especially abhors cats! But cut dogs some slack. They are man's _
yes, even practical man's _ best friend.
</P>
<P>
   _Randall
</P>
<P>
   Pet dogs have little appeal for the practical man. They cost
money, soil the home, foul the air and produce nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the practical man arrived at this truth not by
reason, but by bitter experience. To keep his pet-loving family
happy, he owns not only two slothful canines, but three cats, four
caged birds, two ducks, six rabbits, a turtle, a tank of fish and
lord only knows how many stealth pets such as hamsters, salamanders
and gerbils that live in children's rooms without his knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   That's why he instituted the Adopt-A-Pet Program, wherein every
child is required to sponsor the pets she cares about. Sponsors are
charged with paying all pet expenses, doing all dirty work and,
most important, keeping the filthy beasts away from the practical
man.
</P>
<P>
   An age-old dilemma: My wife rails at me for scanning the TV
channels rapid-fire with the remote control. She prefers the
Stone-Age method of looking at the TV listings and choosing first.
Please tell me that my method is superior, and please, no lectures
on how I'm wasting my life watching TV.
</P>
<P>
   _Roy
</P>
<P>
   The practical man surfs. In fact, he is surfing right now,
flipping rapid-fire through his mail, searching for an intelligent
question worth more than two seconds of his . . . Click.
</P>
<P>
   Just kidding, Roy. Think of TV as a restaurant. She likes to
order from the menu, but you want the all-you-can-eat buffet. The
practical man likes the freedom and the bounty of a buffet, but he
always scans the menu first. Otherwise, he might stuff himself with
chicken tenders and Tater Tots when he could have had a steak and
baked potato for a mere buck more.
</P>
<P>

Fla. Send questions and comments to The Practical Man, Accent, The
Palm Beach Post, P.O. Box 24696, West Palm Beach, Fla. 33416. Or

<P>
   NEW-COMMENTARY _ Kids look at the world fresh, taking it apart
and putting it back together in new combinations. It's always been
a joy to see the world through the eyes of a child. But now that
joy is bought and sold. Corporations hire scouts to prowl the
nightclubs, the streets, the schools, the Internet sites, trying to
pick up the barest scent of something new and track it to its
source. Because these days, if you can deliver new, or even the
illusion of new, they'll make you a director, a producer, an
Internet billionaire. (Bookman, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   SLAVERY-COMMENTARY _ A significant number of Southerners deny
that slavery had much to do with Southern secession. They point to
states' rights, self-determination, liberty, protection of hearth
and home, everything but slavery. No historical event as vast as
the creation of a Southern nation can be explained in monocausal
terms. But there can be no doubt about the centrality of racial
slavery to the creation of the Confederacy. In fact, no slavery, no
Confederacy. (Roark, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ It is pretty much a settled matter for most
Americans that execution for juvenile murder is, like a Martha
Stewart centerpiece, A Good Thing. Indeed, if there's anything
Americans like better than executing juveniles, it is executing
just about anyone else. We're a world leader. (Teepen, Cox
Newspapers.) MOVED MONDAY.
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ (Kleinberg, Cox News Service.) Now that China
and the Clinton administration have signed an agreement that clears
the way for the Communist state to join the World Trade
Organization, Clinton is pledging an ``all-out effort'' with the
Congress for approval of the agreement. Likely he will run into
rough water, in part because of the Monica scandal. Thus has
Clinton's clout gone. MOVED MONDAY.
</P>
<P>
   ROSENFELD-SHORTTAKES _ Hillary Clinton stepped into the Middle
East the other day with little more in mind than making politically
nice. That's impossible in the Middle East. Hillary stepped on a
large, squishy cow chip placed beneath her unwary foot by Soha
Arafat, wife of Palestinian honcho Yasser. (Rosenfeld, Cox News
Service) MOVED MONDAY.
</P>
<P>
   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ It was a chore getting the
stuff off my Ma's shelves. (Schuett, Cox News Service) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ Either a University of Colorado
regent is taking group punishment to the extreme, or he's hit on a
new dimension in campus life. We make rioting a club sport. (Young,
Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MINOR-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Something ``medical''
happened to me recently, and I'm pretty sure I'm going to have to
pay for it myself. I don't think the insurance folks have a code
for what I just lived through. It had to do with Pokemon, Y2K and
Christmas hype _ all of which I blame on Martha Stewart. (Minor,
Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   EDITORIAL-CHINA _ U.S.-China relations have been so poor it is
tempting to view any change as a a boon _ the bigger the change,
the better. This week's trade deal has the potential to civilize
and enrich the world's most populous nation, to the benefit of the
rest of the world, but the deal's details and China's adherence to
them will bear watching. (Atlanta Constitution)

   MONEYTALK _ Financial planning books are on the rise for several
reasons. One is that more and more Americans have investments. One
recent study showed that 52 percent of American households own
stocks or stock mutual funds. Another reason is that we feel more
responsible for building our own financial future and less
confident we can do it. In another study, 45 percent of men and 53
percent of women said they worry about having enough money for the
future. But most of them are sound, and some of them are very good.

   CONTEMPORARY _ ATLANTA _ Atlanta's influx of new people from all
parts of the world is bringing some big changes in the way
Atlantans furnish their homes. In a market once dominated by
traditional tastes _ contemporary furnishing is making noteworthy
inroads. Driving it, designers said, are a number of factors _
fashion trends, mass media design exposure, a nostalgic recall of
classic lines as a new century looms, a strong economy ripe for
risk taking, the home invasion of technology. So what is
contemporary? Think clean lines, light woods, satin metals, natural
fabric and earth colors. (Flanders, Atlanta Journal-Constitution.)

insulation is one of the easiest and most effective ways to lower
your home heating and cooling bills and to increase the comfort
level of your house. (Cummings, Dayton Daily News). 26. MOVED.

   At the San Francisco Zoo, sensitive souls recently performed a
vasectomy on  &UR; Roy &LR; , a 5-month-old blackbuck antelope whom they
didn't want to become a father.
</P>
<P>
   The reason they didn't castrate the animal, which would have
been an easier procedure: Male blackbucks are born light brown, &LR; 
but eventually become black; castration would prevent that
darkening. Although zoo officials felt strongly about limiting his
reproductive activities, ``we still want him to look like a male,''
said zoo representative  &UR; Nancy Chan &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Because of Roy's young age, he is not fully integrated into the
blackbuck community, but when he reaches sexual maturity at 2 or
so, ``he will still be interested in females,'' veterinarian  &UR; John &LR; 
 &UR; Ochsenreiter  &LR; told Personals. Roy's possible rival for female
attentions is a rather aged male blackbuck _ also, as they say,
shooting blanks _ in residence. Although neither can become a
father, the dueling suitors will have to work out the details of
romance between among &LR;  themselves.

CHARLIE ROBISON BREAKS THE RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEY GUERRA  
 c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charlie Robison has never played by the often-constricting rules
of mainstream country music _ even when he's had the chance.
</P>
<P>
   The Austin, Texas-based singer-songwriter, who plays with his
brother, Bruce Robison, and Jack Ingram, first made waves with his
independent debut album, ``Bandera'' _ named for the small Texas
town where he grew up.
</P>
<P>
   Excited by Robison's songwriting skills and eclectic country
flavor, major labels came calling. Warner Bros. offered Robison a
contract, and he signed on the dotted line. Disappointments soon
followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just took forever,'' said Robison, 33, of making that
album, which was shelved by the label, never to be released. ``It
was kind of an unlimited-budget deal. I didn't really like that.
You had enough time to second-guess yourself and really take a lot
of the soul out of the recording.''
</P>
<P>
   When it came time for Robison to record 1998's ``Life of the
Party,'' the bigwigs came sniffing around again. Robison was
naturally wary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was real tough for me to go back (to a major label), and
when Sony offered me a deal, I was like, `OK, is this what I wanna
do?''' Robison said. ``The first time around, it wasn't a great
experience at all.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Sony subsidiary label Lucky Dog offered Robison
what his former label wouldn't: complete artistic freedom and no
push for promotion or radio singles.
</P>
<P>
   Working with co-producer Lloyd Maines, Robison made ``Life of
the Party'' in just 10 days. The result? A solid blend of
rockabilly, Tex-Mex and honky tonk, anchored by Robison's
thought-provoking songwriting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, I'm a good study of the human condition,'' Robison
said. ``The best things to write about aren't famous people or
anything like that.
</P>
<P>
   It's the small towns, the scrungiest bars, just the regular
folk.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up, Robison was heavily influenced by a number of
been-there, done-that songwriters, including Jackson Browne, Willie
Nelson and Guy Clark. It was only natural that his words would come
straight from the heart.
</P>
<P>
   He also admires the music of Bruce Springsteen and Tom Waits,
saying, ``They talked about how human beings weren't perfect. It
made you feel like you weren't the only one out there who had kinda
screwed up in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Robison showcases his brand of being human in a number of songs.
``Sunset Boulevard'' finds a man yearning for fame so he can deal
with a failed relationship (``I'd spend all my money/On caviar and
Rogaine/And I would not remember/How you broke my heart today'').
``You're Not the Best'' is an oddly affecting ode to a
less-than-perfect love (``We're gonna twist them lids and hope/Our
kids look more like me than you.'') Humor, it seems, is another
vital element in Robison's alternative to country-music radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the guys I listen to, they'd always be talking about
something real serious, and then I'd start cracking up at the same
time,'' Robison said. ``John Prine, especially, always had a way of
sneaking humor into the most serious of situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Robison is planning to head back into the studio in late
December or early January to record a new album, one he hopes will
``be along the lines of what I've always done, but I hope it still
continues to change a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Current commitments include the Lucky Dog tour, which finds the
Texas-based performers and label mates consolidating their bands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been great. We've all been really good friends, of
course, and Bruce has been my brother for a long time,'' Robison
said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``All three of us had kind of the eclectic country crowd
together. It was easier for the label, too. With tour support and
publicity and things like that, they were able to kinda kill three
birds with one stone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Robison brothers have shared many stages, and Bruce, along
with wife Kelly Willis, even pops up singing background vocals on
Charlie's ``Life of the Party.'' Robison admits the two brothers
have their share of disagreements, but he chalks it up to regular
family routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been real close throughout the whole journey. Musically,
there's just such a real close kinship there,'' Robison said.
``Plus, everybody's gotten so busy that this is like almost the
only time we get to hang out with each other. That's kind of a cool
aspect to it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the hectic schedule is due to Robison's marriage to
Dixie Chick Emily Erwin in May. The two made a few side trips as a
honeymoon during the Dixie Chicks' European tour.
</P>
<P>
   As for a possible lovey-dovey musical collaboration, Robison
said he and his wife plan to take their time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about it. That will probably happen down the line,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just so important for us to completely hammer out careers
where you're looked at separately before you do anything like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Given Robison's penchant for remaining an individual, that
shouldn't be too much of a problem.

<P>
   Far smarter than the average woman-in-peril telefilm, no doubt
because it's based on an Anna Quindlen novel, ``Black and Blue''
offers a solemn yet surprisingly redemptive take on the issue of
battered wives. As awful as one's choices in life may be,
Quindlen's book and the film ultimately decide, one's resolute
instinct for motherhood smooths the bumps along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your children make it impossible to regret your past,''
Quindlen writes at the end of her book. ``They're its finest
fruits.''
</P>

   Mary Stuart Masterson stars as Fran, married to Bobby (Anthony
LaPaglia), whose job as a Brooklyn police detective, everyone
apparently agrees, protects him from censure when he beats his
wife. One day, Fran tires of the routine bruisings and approaches a
woman at a rescue shelter, who immediately decides that counseling
or divorce are not options _ Fran must change her identity and move
away. That decision is arrived at far too quickly, but after all,
this is just a two-hour film.
</P>
<P>
   Fran, pausing idiotically to cut her own hair at home before
going on the lam _ what's the point of changing your looks if you
telegraph to the guy you're hiding from that your looks have been
changed? _ takes her fifth-grade son, Robert (Will Rothaar), with
her. Though he fears the beatings his mother takes almost as much
as she does, he's terribly conflicted about skipping out on his dad
_ the film drops disquieting hints that Robert has perhaps already
assimilated some of his father's moody traits.
</P>
<P>
   They land in a rathole in Florida and struggle to remake their
lives (the rescue center provided them with new identities). Of
course, back home, Bobby isn't reacting well to his beloved
punching bag's disloyalty, and a fairly convenient plot contrivance
assists him in his search for his family.
</P>
<P>
   Masterson _ an actress who has always been a little too
interesting and internal in her work for Hollywood to transform her
into a star _ does reliably sensitive work here. LaPaglia, in what
could easily be a thankless role, gives a finely calibrated
performance _ at times, one can almost see why Fran stays with this
lout.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast this film with ``Sleeping With the Enemy,'' the fairly
ridiculous 1991 Julia Roberts vehicle that serves up essentially
the same plot, and you'll appreciate just how much this film gets
right. ``Black and Blue'' never lapses into the overheated hokum of
its predecessor, and where the couple's final confrontation was
pure lunacy in the big-screen movie, here it's chillingly
effective, disquietingly realistic and artfully discrete. A film
like this could almost give the women-in-peril telegenre a good
name.

QUEEN OF SOUL PENS IMPERFECT AUTOBIOGRAPHY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRENDA GUNTER  
 c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (``Aretha: From These Roots''; by Aretha Franklin and David
Ritz; Villard, $25)
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's zooming who?'' Raising more questions than it answers,
Aretha Franklin's autobiography, written with David Ritz, evokes
her 1986 hit about being played for a fool.
</P>
<P>
   The story of how Franklin rose from her humble beginnings in
Memphis, Tenn., in 1942 to become the Queen of Soul is fascinating.
She warmly recalls the people and places of Detroit, where her
family moved soon after her birth. Her father, the Rev. C.L.
Franklin, a legend in his own right, set a high standard for his
three daughters and two sons to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin's mother, nurse's aide Barbara Siggers, moved to
Buffalo, N.Y., when Franklin was 6 years old. Here, in the first
chapter, the book begins an irksome pattern. Franklin explains that
her mother, contrary to what a Time magazine profile suggested, did
not abandon her family.
</P>
<P>
   Then she sets the record straight by explaining how her parents
had agreed that the children would remain in Detroit. The children
and their mother visited often for the next four years, until her
mother's death when Franklin was 10.
</P>
<P>
   Criticizing an erroneous story more than 20 years old gives it
more validity than it deserves. It also adds an awkward sense of
hostility to what otherwise serves as an engaging narrative.
</P>
<P>
   As the Rev. Franklin's church grew, numerous performers began to
call the Franklin household their second home. Gospel singers James
Cleveland and Clara Ward, not to mention a young pop sensation
named Sam Cooke, stopped by often, providing musical inspiration.
Smokey Robinson was a family friend.
</P>
<P>
   When Franklin was 13, she became pregnant with the first of her
four children. She bore a second child at 16. Here again, she
offers little insight. How did a minister's daughter become an
unmarried teen mother not once but twice? She explains it away by
saying her father considered all children blessings from God. And
she coyly refers to the children's fathers in pseudonyms such as
``Romeo.'' Although there has been speculation that one or both of
the children were Cooke's, the context of her narrative doesn't
support it.
</P>
<P>
   Groomed by her father as a singer, Franklin got a record
contract with Columbia in 1960. Legendary producer John Hammond
marketed her as a jazz singer, and she gained experience on the
nightclub circuit, supported by a four-piece band. Then, in 1966,
she moved to Atlantic, where producer Jerry Wexler turned her into
the Queen of Soul. Songs such as ``Respect,'' ``Think'' and ``Chain
of Fools'' ensured her success. She currently records with Arista.
</P>
<P>
   While telling of her journey to stardom, Franklin drops names
right and left. She engages in catty commentary, criticizing Gladys
Knight and gospel singer Cissy Houston, whose daughter Whitney
calls her Auntie Ree and credits her as her inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   She describes Barbra Streisand in all but name, telling of an
incident in which the nameless diva gestured obscenely to her in
the White House during Bill Clinton's first term. She even disses
some of the family members to whom she dedicated the book.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, ``Aretha: From These Roots'' provides no index
for the dirt-diggers among us. A more extensive discography would
have been nice, too, given her musical stature.
</P>
<P>
   Ritz, who has written biographies of Ray Charles, Marvin Gaye
and B.B.
</P>
<P>
   King, knows his subject but sometimes allows factual errors to
slip by, such as one that placed Franklin at a different stage in
her career than history indicates. As a professional writer, he
should have taken a more active role in playing down Franklin's
petty grievances and playing up the specifics of her musical
career.
</P>
<P>
   Although Franklin will always be the Queen of Soul, we may never
know quite why. ``Aretha'' does a decent job covering the basics,
but it lacks the insight that must be present to make an
autobiography a worthwhile account.
</P>

SAVVY AGENTS GOING ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HARRY SHATTUCK  
 c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Amid the competition between traditional travel agents
and upstart online services to plan and book our vacations, a new
strategy is emerging: Travel agencies in Houston and nationwide are
beginning to establish an Internet presence of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some reports indicate that almost 50 percent of all
agencies now sponsor a Web site, although these fledgling ventures
vary dramatically in quality and depth.
</P>
<P>
   This development isn't surprising given these factors: _
Research shows that travel-related Internet sites continue to grow
in terms of access and interest, a reality standard agencies can't
afford to ignore. The variety and ingenuity of online offerings _
from last-minute air-fare specials to bid sites and auctions _ also
is expanding.
</P>
<P>
   _ At the same time, Web browsing isn't necessarily translating
into Web bookings: Online reservations also are increasing but at a
slower pace, with studies showing that most travelers _ even the
majority of ``wired'' travelers _ still favor travel agents when
purchasing trip elements.
</P>
<P>
   Reasons cited most are the importance of human contact and
concern about online security.
</P>
<P>
   THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS
</P>
<P>
   Savvy travel agents hope to offer consumers the best of both
worlds: the opportunity to research and shop online, with follow-up
counseling readily available.
</P>
<P>
   While family-owned agencies don't possess the resources to rival
the scope of online giants such as Travelocity, Expedia and
Priceline or a projected new site involving several major airlines,
they can ``localize'' information, stress the variety of available
services _ and remind that visiting their office requires only a
short drive. In many instances, bookings would be available online
or at the agency office.
</P>
<P>
   So how is this online experiment faring in its infancy? A
surfing expedition last week proved enlightening.
</P>
<P>
   And frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   ACCESSING GOOD INFORMATION
</P>
<P>
   At several sites recently initiated by local agencies, I
uncovered useful information about discounted tour packages,
half-price cruises, honeymoon packages and other up-to-date
bargains.
</P>
<P>
   One site sponsored by West University Travel
(www.westutravel.com), an American Express affiliate, covers topics
as diverse as hot millennium deals, Houston-area passport
acceptance offices, descriptions of shore excursions aboard the
Houston-based Norwegian Sea cruise ship and a calendar of upcoming
area travel shows.
</P>
<P>
   Another operated by Woodlake Travel Services
(www.woodlaketravel.com), which has two offices in west Houston,
describes a wide range of trips but also provides links to currency
exchange rates, State Department Consular Information Sheets,
reports from the Centers for Disease Control, student travel
bargains _ and lodging in Scottish castles.
</P>
<P>
   Savings Travel, an agency in southwest Houston whose specialties
include consolidator air fares, offers ``Today's Specials From
Houston'' on its site at www.savingstravel.com. At
www.vacationstogo.com, operated by Houston-based Vacations to Go, a
``90-day ticker'' lists almost 200 sharply discounted cruises
available from that company for departures over the next three
months.
</P>
<P>
   Most local agencies, however, don't possess the staff or
resources of Vacations to Go, which markets nationally. And it's
evident that agencies affiliated with a national chain or
consortium hold a distinct advantage in being able to pool
resources in creating Web sites and in attracting potential
customers through a common link.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: I accessed www.carlsontravel.com, and that site
guided me to information about the 14 Houston-area Carlson Wagonlit
agencies. I learned that 12 operate Web sites, 11 are set up to
receive e-mail inquiries and two are equipped to handle
reservations online.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when I sneaked a peek at these individual sites, I found
quite a contrast. Future Travel in nearby Clear Lake City listed
about 25 discounted air-hotel special packages from Houston to
Jamaica, Cancun, Las Vegas and other destinations. Utopia Travel in
the Galleria area offered a complimentary e-mail listing of several
cruises currently available at half-price. But some Carlson
agencies merely reproduced the standard ``home page'' offered by
the parent company, providing no practical information. One
rerouted me to an agency in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   My biggest challenge was in discovering the mere existence of
other Houston agency sites. And while I'm no expert at this
search-from-scratch process, neither are many of the potential
customers agencies hope to attract.
</P>
<P>
   I was especially disappointed when I accessed www.astanet.com,
the Internet operation of the 28,000-member American Society of
Travel Agents. A consumer-friendly site in many ways, this online
service allows browsers to type the first three numbers of a ZIP
code (or a city name) and, in response, lists all member agencies
(or, if preferred, those with a special focus) within that region.
</P>
<P>
   When I typed the numbers 770 for Houston, www.astanet.com
quickly identified 180 member agencies by name, address and
telephone number.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail addresses also were provided for about half the agencies.
But only one direct Internet link _ to TransAmerica Travel (at
www.traveltata.com) in southwest Houston _ was included.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, at www.supertravel.com and www.allseasons.com, I found
a wealth of general information but no Houston affiliates' Web
addresses or direct links.
</P>
<P>
   I predict that this will soon change _ that ASTA and leading
multiagent organizations will be at the forefront of identifying
and promoting individual agency Internet projects.
</P>
<P>
   And consumers can only benefit from new options for discovering
vacation bargains.

DOG DROPPINGS NOT OFTEN FATAL TO LAWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KATHY HUBER  
 c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Q: I have heard that dog urine and droppings can
damage a lawn. Can you tell me what effect these have on a
well-maintained, healthy lawn? A: We live in a neighborhood with
lots of dogs and dog walkers, but no sidewalks. Our lawns run right
to the narrow street, and dog excreta is a daily deal. I'm not
complaining; we have dogs, too.
</P>
<P>
   But I've noted that a small amount of urine either has no effect
or results in a small brown or yellow circle ringed in dark green.
Dog urine contains nitrogen and works like fertilizer. The grass
seems to handle urine just fine in relatively small doses. The
brown/yellow spots eventually green up again.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the dog can be a factor. And because they squat,
female dogs can leave greater concentrations, which you can dilute
by watering.
</P>
<P>
   According to research I've read, it's possible that dog excreta
does greater damage to lawns already maxed out on fertilizer. It
all amounts to nitrogen overload.
</P>
<P>
   If a dog frequently visits the same spot, the grass in that area
likely will die. In this case, I would redirect the dog. But
because our growing season is so long, the spot should eventually
fill back in.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is tolerant. And I'm not happy when our male
dog lifts its leg and marks a prized perennial. While one visit may
not do much damage, continued visits will, so I grab the water hose
in an attempt to wash away the odor that triggers return visits.
</P>
<P>
   While dog urine is liquid and the nitrogen is more quickly
absorbed, dog feces break down more slowly and are less likely to
burn the lawn. Of course, if a dog messes regularly where there's
traffic, you'll likely want to remove the feces.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Since I'm not a scientist, I did a little Internet research of
my own and found quite a bit has been said on this subject. One
article listed on the Aggie Horticulture Plant Answers Web site is
a detailed report from a Purdue University veterinarian. His paper
puts a lot of lawn myths to rest. For details, see
aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/plantanswers/turf/doglawnproblems.html.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do I care for a potted thornless lime? How do I get a
potted bird of paradise to bloom again? A: The thornless lime is
pretty easy. Give it plenty of sun to maximize blooms. Provide a
good, well-draining potting soil. You can work a little sand,
perlite or large-size composted bark into the potting soil to
prevent future compaction.
</P>
<P>
   Your small tree likes moderate water but not soggy conditions.
Keep the soil evenly moist, especially for summer production. The
best results come with a biweekly or monthly application of a
balanced liquid fertilizer such as a 10-10-10 during the growing
season. Slow-release fertilizers are suitable, too. Flush the
container every six weeks or so to discourage a buildup of salts.
</P>
<P>
   Should chlorosis develop _ yellowing between veins in the leaves
_ you may be overwatering. A second possibility is low soil
fertility. The third cause is improper soil pH. Citrus fruits do
not like a too-alkaline soil, indicated by a high pH, preferring
one that is neutral to slightly acidic.
</P>
<P>
   This citrus requires minimum pruning. Remove suckers and damaged
or dead wood, and occasionally shape the tree, if needed. Avoid
fall pruning, as this will promote new growth more vulnerable to
frost.
</P>
<P>
   Repot next spring if necessary. Fifteen-gallon containers are
recommended for mature trees so the plant can become large enough
to bear good quantities of fruit.
</P>
<P>
   You're likely to find that spring brings the heaviest blooms and
fruit, but the thornless lime will continue to bloom anytime it is
warm. Fruit drop is common among citrus, and there's nothing a
gardener can do but be patient. Fruit drop should decrease with
age.
</P>
<P>
   The plant should be OK to 32 degrees, but below that pull it out
of the cold. If the plant should burn back, it likely will regrow,
unless a severe freeze kills the roots.
</P>
<P>
   Bird of paradise (``Strelitzia reginae''), native to South
Africa, grows to about 4 feet in height and prefers a
well-draining, fertile soil, moisture during the growing season but
drier conditions while dormant. Give it sun to light shade.
</P>
<P>
   Bird of paradise will not bloom until it's mature and has formed
a large clump, which may take several years. To encourage flowering
then, apply a fertilizer low in nitrogen and high in phosphorus and
potassium. Cool winter temperatures are said to help flowering once
a plant is mature, and container plants flower best if somewhat
root-bound.
</P>
<P>
   While bird of paradise may survive a dip to the mid-20s, it's
best to protect it during freezing weather.
</P>
<P>

AFTER SIX YEARS AS 007, PIERCE BROSNAN ITCHES FOR A NEW ASSIGNMENT
 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LOUIS B. PARKS   
 c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a James Bond film, it's traditional to cut to
the chase at the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   So tell us, Mr. Brosnan, Pierce Brosnan, will ``The World Is Not
Enough'' be, as rumored, your last go as Secret Agent 007? He gives
a sly, knowing grin.
</P>
<P>
   But let's not be misleading. Though movie stars have many
reasons to be cagey about their plans, Brosnan does not seem
deceitful.
</P>
<P>
   Some stars look you straight in the eye and smile, then lie.
Brosnan looks uncomfortable and chooses his words carefully before
answering a question, often with a self-deprecating comment and a
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   He's a fascinating combination: a star of obvious confidence and
knowledge of where he wants to be, yet also a regular chap eager to
please. He gives the impression he knows that, despite all his
talent and good looks, luck and timing are a great part of where he
is now.
</P>
<P>
   In this, our fourth interview, he seems much as he did for the
first, four years ago for his initial Bond film, ``GoldenEye.'' He
just seems a bit more tired today, less eager and excited than when
Bond was new for him.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he's complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can become quite tiresome living with the character (of
Bond),'' he says. ``He can become annoying, an intrusion within
your life.
</P>
<P>
   ``But get over it. I would be a complete and utter fraud if I
said I haven't had the best time in my life doing this role the
last five years.''
</P>
<P>
   If less excited, Brosnan certainly has not lost his sense of
humor.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day with a small group of journalists, Brosnan
finished a long, serious answer to a vague question with a
self-mocking comedic flurry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Round 18, Round 18,'' he said, like a punch-drunk boxer
talking to himself. ``Keep going, keep going, keep going. Stay off
the ropes, stay off the ropes, stay off the ropes, 'cause you don't
know what you're talking about. You're just an actor. Get out of
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Now as he welcomes me to his room for the interview, he is his
usual friendly self, asking polite questions and offering a drink.
For himself, he requests a beer, a Beck's. When his assistant
brings it, he gives her a big smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are a grand woman,'' he says in an appreciative tone Bond
would never use. ``Thank you very much.''
</P>
<P>
   He is dressed in a shimmering blue-gray silk shirt with large,
unusual silver cuff links.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an old clotheshorse at heart,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He also wears a Bondish black leather jacket, dark slacks, no
rings or jewelry except a heavy silver watch with a black band. He
has a two-day growth of beard that adds to the tired look.
</P>
<P>
   But back to THE question. After ``Tomorrow Never Dies,'' his
second Bond film, Brosnan was unsatisfied. Despite opening against
Titanic, the film was a huge hit, making more money ($125 million)
in North America than any other Bond film and raking up $343
million worldwide. But it offered little more than slick, overblown
action scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't do another `Tomorrow Never Dies,''' Brosnan says.
``They're just boring to do, really, when there is so much action.
You have no continuity or an emotional performance. No character.
No interaction with the other characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sound like fun and look like fun in the cinema, but to
actually do them over a period of six months, up at 5 o'clock, home
at 8 o'clock, it wears you down.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Brosnan likes to get himself into the stunts far more than
Roger Moore ever did. In a spectacular shot in ``TWINE,'' as the
new film is commonly called, with Bond racing a huge fireball down
a tunnel, that is Brosnan we see, replacing the stuntman who did it
first. And Brosnan did much of the 80-mph boat chase on the Thames
River that opens the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thames was a great scene for me because I could acquit
myself well in the boat,'' Brosnan says. ``I enjoyed doing it. I
enjoy speed and boats and cars. When you find a sequence like that,
and you can do it, and you are willing to put yourself in there, it
only enhances the whole audience's enjoyment of that piece.''
</P>
<P>
   He was contracted for three Bond films, with an option for a
fourth, so rumors began to fly that ``The World Is Not Enough''
would be his farewell.
</P>
<P>
   But before doing ``TWINE,'' Brosnan pushed for more drama and a
serious director. So the producers picked Michael Apted, director
of ``Nell,'' ``Gorillas in the Mist'' and ``Coal Miner's Daughter''
to put flesh and bones on the characters. Apted was shocked to be
asked, and Brosnan was thrilled to have him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apted and I hit chords in this movie that haven't been hit in
the last two,'' Brosnan says. ``We've come back to the original
premise of the character in some respects.''
</P>
<P>
   The characters and interaction remain thin, and the emphasis is
still on action, globe-trotting and more action. But this film does
allow Bond the most feeling since the brief Timothy Dalton era in
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Brosnan admits it's just a first step at re-establishing the
complex, self-analyzing Bond that author Ian Fleming created.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want more,'' he says of this new direction. ``More of the
character of Bond. In situations where he is tested and seen in a
different light.
</P>
<P>
   Where he lives, what he is like. What's it like after he has
killed someone?'' There is a hint of exactly that in ``TWINE,''
when Bond is forced to kill someone close to him and then shows his
pain. It was a favorite scene for Brosnan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted him to have a relationship with a (person) who really
gets to him,'' Brosnan says. ``Michael (Apted) and I talked about
that. It was constructed in a way that made sense and had the
surprise element to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the day of shooting, Michael and I didn't talk about it. It
just seemed to be the thing to do. I could have just shot and
turned and walked out, but it seemed to take the beat of going to
the body, the simple gesture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we struck a good balance, with this one, of character
and story and action. I'm not trying to detract from what we've got
going here, but it's wonderful when you have a story that opens up
and you want to know what happens next.''
</P>
<P>
   So don't start the search for a new 007 just yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bond is a wonderful thing to have in your back pocket,''
Brosnan says.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point I will have to give it up. (But) I'll do
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rumors were not started by me. You hear about people
retiring. I'm just beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   He may push to do the Bond movies every third year, instead of
the traditional every other year. If so, MGM, which bankrolls the
films, is likely to battle the idea. The Bond films have kept the
struggling studio afloat for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ambivalent,'' Brosnan says. ``There is a part of me that
wants to go toe-to-toe with the studio and push for a three-year
break.
</P>
<P>
   ``And (there's another part) thinking well, I'm 46 (he jokingly
counts on his fingers) 47, 48, 49. There's that aspect of one's own
clock ticking, as a quote-unquote male action ...'' He stops
himself from saying ``hero,'' instead finishing after a pause,
``actor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thomas Crown Affair,'' which so far has made $69 million
domestically ($107 million worldwide), was the first major film for
Brosnan's own company, Irish Dream Time. (The first film was a
small Irish movie _ Brosnan is Irish _ called ``The Nephew,'' in
which Brosnan had a role.) Being James Bond did not immediately
lead to stardom for Brosnan, any more than it did for Dalton or
Moore. Since ``GoldenEye,'' Brosnan has starred in a number of
small films and had supporting roles in big ones (``Mars
Attacks!,'' ``The Mirror Has Two Faces''), but it wasn't until
``Dante's Peak'' (1997) and this summer's ``The Thomas Crown
Affair,'' that he really began headlining big non-Bond pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crown'' has been a big boost to Brosnan's confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the bit between my teeth now having done `Thomas Crown,'
I'm excited to try other things and go further afield,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ```Thomas Crown' played safe in the actual playing of the
character.
</P>
<P>
   Not so safe in the choice of material, which was rather risky.''
</P>
<P>
   In playing Thomas Crown, Brosnan took on a role made famous by
Steve McQueen, thus opening himself up to comparison with a screen
icon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time now, I feel, to take more risks,'' he says. ``To
find material which is going to challenge me and test any acting
ability I have.
</P>
<P>
   Either in a dramatic role or going to romantic comedy. That
comes with having faith in one's self.''
</P>
<P>
   Brosnan is about to take on another challenge. Marriage.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Brosnan's first wife, actress Cassandra Harris (who had
a role in the Bond movie ``For Your Eyes Only,'' done with Moore)
died of ovarian cancer. She had a son and daughter from a previous
marriage, and the couple had a son together. Brosnan raised all
three.
</P>
<P>
   He took the loss hard and became prominent in several
organizations promoting women's health. He has since gotten
involved in environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   For the past five years, he has lived with TV journalist Keely
Shaye Smith. They have a child, 2 1/2-year-old Dylan Thomas
Brosnan. They now plan to marry, though Brosnan begged off saying
when.
</P>
<P>
   Why get married now, after all these years together? ``Love,''
he says, sitting forward and managing to sound at once
self-conscious and proud. ``Because we love each other, and I want
the world to know I love this woman, and we respect each other, and
we celebrate our love, and I don't know any better way than saying
`be my wife' and standing up there in the eyes of God and doing
that with friends. It's traditional and old-fashioned, but we've
had the most wonderful nearly six years together.''
</P>
<P>
   Brosnan remains involved in charity work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The environment and women's health care all came together at a
certain point in my life, and I followed my instincts and my heart
because of that and lent myself and my name to certain causes that
I think are necessary for us all to pay attention to.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been enriching in many ways, and should I _ maybe five
years, 10 years from now _ want to give up (acting), which comes
across my mind from time to time, then it would be maybe to work on
certain areas like that.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Brosnan has no plans to leave either movies or James
Bond.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a lovely surprise for me to see these films.
</P>
<P>
   ``(During shooting) I am concerned with who Bond is and trying
to get a performance in there of some kind. Then you see them, and
the work is pretty outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   He's happy with the way he plays Bond, but don't ask him to
characterize it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to,'' he says. ``It's too dangerous. Let the work
speak for itself. You either like it, or you don't like it. It's
not for me to say what my performance is. The history books will
say.''

A MADE-FOR-TV START BY THE JETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the Jets holding an 18-point lead over the Patriots at the
end of the first half, ABC's Al Michaels quipped, ``Isn't this a
fine kettle of Tuna?''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the funniest thing ever said on Monday Night Football,
but it was apt.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Parcells appeared every bit the curse radio talk-show
callers have made him out to be. But a curse had nothing to do with
Curtis Martin's 36-yard draw play in which he ran into the end zone
untouched. It was a perfect call that caught Chris Slade
overrunning the play. In the second half, the Jets orchestrated an
11-minute drive that resulted in a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't have scripted a better game for the Jets, so
far,'' said Boomer Esiason at the start of the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Everything went the Jets' way early. ``The 2-6 Jets came here to
the home of the 6-2 Patriots and have completely dominated the
game,'' Michaels said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Michaels and Boomer Esiason disagreed with Patriots coach
Pete Carroll's decision to go for a touchdown instead of kicking a
field goal from the Jets' 1-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Boomer was particularly baffled by Drew Bledsoe's first
interception when he threw a bomb into the wind. ``Drew has a
strong arm but the ball just hung up there,'' Esiason said.
</P>
<P>
   Boomer praised Jets quarterback Ray Lucas for his poise and
enthusiasm. Lucas scrambled out of the pocket for a nice
first-quarter gain. ``That's what football players do,'' Esiason
said. ``They make things happen. Lucas is a football player first
and a quarterback second.''
</P>
<P>
   Michaels got off a good line about the Jets' defense.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of single coverage on Ben Coates near the goal line,
Parcells had two men on the tight end, prompting Michaels to
describe the defense as ``coverage by mugging.''
</P>
<P>
   Michaels, the only one left from MNF's glory days, showed again
that he is the consummate professional. His voice is timeless,
equally at home with old-school announcers like Curt Gowdy and new
kids like Joe Buck. He has called Super Bowls, Olympics, World
Series, and the Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   Michaels is probably best known for his call of the US Olympic
hockey team's upset victory at Lake Placid in 1980: ``Do you
believe in miracles?''
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Michaels has been unafraid to criticize NFL team
owners or even television networks. During a broadcast of the
Oakland Raiders' 13-3 loss to the Denver Broncos two years ago on a
Monday night, Michaels called the Raiders ``the most underachieving
team in the league'' and derided the team's slogan, ``Commitment to
Excellence.''
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders criticized Michaels, but he responded by saying he
was simply being true to his fans.
</P>
<P>
   Using a two-man booth has allowed the game to breathe a little
more, said Michaels, and that fits perfectly with the times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Viewers are inundated with special effects,'' he said. ``Why
do I have to listen to a sound effect every time there is a
different camera shot? If producers don't use special effects
judiciously, it could turn viewers away from their television sets.
We don't want to be stodgy or anything, but viewers have become so
accustomed to so much noise and clutter that silence is almost
welcomed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Monday Night Football'' is still a fixture in the American
sports landscape, still important after all these years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just hope that people are not footballed out by Monday,''
Michaels said.
</P>
<P>
   That is not a sign of surrender. Michaels said that ``Monday
Night Football'' has maintained ``its sense of uniqueness,''
despite a slew of competition from various cable stations and prime
time network shows such as ``Ally McBeal'' and professional
wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've evolved over the years,'' Michaels said. ``We try to
entertain with more information. The viewers expect more these days
and we are, essentially, in the copycat business. Fox comes out
with a scorebox and now everyone has one. Our philosophy is to not
ask ourselves what we can do differently but what can we do to
enhance the show.''

ANOTHER MASTERFUL GAME PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ He thought it was stacked against him from
the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   A Monday night game on the road against a team that considers
his team its most bitter rival.
</P>
<P>
   And waiting for him was an officiating crew he would have
preferred not to see because of past experiences.
</P>
<P>
   But when it was all over, and he had another improbable victory
to add to his brilliant coaching dossier, the Jets' Bill Parcells
was more tired than jubilant.
</P>
<P>
   His team had overcome tremendous odds to gain its most
satisfying win of the season, but he wasn't about to gloat. He
likes too many Patriots players to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Everything was tilted the Patriots' way. At home. Two weeks off.
Friendly officiating crew. Sellout crowd.
</P>
<P>
   But Parcells had given his team a pregame message, something he
has said for weeks: ``It's too soon to quit.''
</P>
<P>
   They might be in the midst of a tremendously disappointing
season, but Monday night they fought to save some face.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to play a complementary game to win,'' said Parcells
Saturday. ``We have to run the ball on offense; take time off the
clock; keep Drew (Bledsoe) from completing any 30-yard passes. If
we do that, we have a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets did, and they won. The game wasn't as close as the
final score. They used the wind to breeze to a 24-3 lead entering
the fourth quarter, and then watched as the defense came apart
before regrouping to stop the Patriots twice in the final five
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' game plan was simple: Do everything possible to knock
down Bledsoe. They were not going to let him get comfortable in the
pocket, and they would try to have someone in his face all night.
</P>
<P>
   The first three quarters were a nightmare for the Patriots'
quarterback. He had just 73 yards passing and had thrown three
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets pressed him, knocked him down, chased him out of the
pocket, completely throwing the Patriots' passing game out of
rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets weren't even concerned with the Patriots' running game.
They never considered it a threat. Bledsoe was the target and they
zeroed in on him.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the lone mistake the Jets' defense made came in the
fourth quarter when they seemed to play soft with a 21-point lead.
When they did, Bledsoe took advantage and ignited the Patriots to
two quick touchdowns. After that, the Jets blitzed relentlessly and
Bledsoe didn't have a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Martin was a one-man gang for the Jets, who lined up and
ran power football at the Patriots' line. Most of the time they ran
Martin to the perimeter behind a cortege of pulling linemen,
letting him pick his spot to make a slashing run across the line of
scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   The wind was strong the entire evening and the Jets made better
use of it than the Patriots. New York held the ball for 37 minutes
38 seconds, more than 15 minutes longer than the Patriots (22:22),
meaning they had the ball for a full quarter more than the
Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets scored all of their touchdowns with the wind in the
second period; the Patriots didn't score a point with the wind all
night.
</P>
<P>
   The critical sequence in the game came in the third period, and
trickled into the fourth, when the Jets held the ball for for 19
plays and 11 minutes before kicking a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   That forced the Patriots to try to make up a 21-point deficit
going into the wind in the fourth period.
</P>
<P>
   With a little more than 2 minutes left, Parcells had to make a
key decison. The Jets led, 24-17, but the Patriots had a fourth and
1 at the New England 41.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about going for it right there,'' said Parcells.
``If we made it, we won the game. But I thought we would be better
off punting the ball, and having our defense stop them.''
</P>
<P>
   They did and he had another victory over the Patriots in
Foxborough, that was good, but in his words, ``nothing special.
People keep trying to say this is special. It's not. It's just
another win. I'm happy for my players. They played hard and did
what they had to do to win.''

BARROS, OTHER CELTICS SUBS, TRY TO GET STRAIGHTENED OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ _ He is a writer, known for his accurate phrasing.
There have been times when he has sat on the team bus and penned a
few verses. He shares his work, too. Last season, he thought about
the role of the Celtics' second unit and gave the group a perfect
nickname: The Bomb Squad.
</P>
<P>
   Only seven games into the season, the writer _ Dana Barros _ has
a significant task. Some of the Bomb Squad members have changed,
and the man who named them now sees some strange numbers next to
his name.
</P>
<P>
   Barros is averaging 4.6 points and shooting 42 percent in 15
minutes per game. Some of his most unpleasant days as a pro came
when he played in Seattle, but Barros still didn't have numbers
like that in any season with the Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   Is it time to panic? He might do that if he didn't have
archives. All he has to do is go through his files and stop at the
folder marked ``1999 Season, Beginning Of'' to put this in
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I was terrible at the beginning of the season,'' he
said. ``I shot something like 20 percent from 3-point range at the
beginning of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   His 3-point shooting is not a problem now. He has taken seven
shots from Faraway Land and made four of them. Being the economical
writer that he is, Barros summed up his early weaknesses in one
sentence: ``I just have to be more aggressive.'' Later, he
explained, ``Right now, I'm just a spot-up shooter and I'm a better
player than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, several members of this season's Bomb Squad are better
than they have shown. Tony Battie can be very effective when he
spots up 10 feet from the hoop and releases a high-arcing jumper.
But that hasn't happened enough and Battie is shooting 39 percent
from the floor. Walter McCarty began the season with a stunning
performance against the Raptors, including 6 for 6 from 3-point
range. Since then, he has gone 2 for 10 on his threes and is
shooting 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Williams? He has played 100 fewer minutes than Vitaly
Potapenko but has attempted five more free throws than the
6-foot-10-inch center. The problem with Williams is simply time. As
in, where does he find it playing behind Adrian Griffin and Paul
Pierce, No. 1 and No. 2 on the team in minutes played?
</P>
<P>
   Coach Rick Pitino said he was pleased with the bench play, with
the exception of Saturday night's loss at Chicago. The bench was 3
for 20 from the field at the United Center. Barros was 1 for 4.
</P>
<P>
   As the literary leader-unofficial spokesman for the Bomb Squad,
Barros said he knows what the group must do. It is nothing
complicated. Simply, the players have to depend on each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to play that way,'' Barros said. ``We don't have a
go-to guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The second unit will get some reinforcements in the next several
weeks. Calbert Cheaney will return when he recovers from an ankle
sprain. Pitino said Monday that if the team followed the examples
set by Cheaney and Griffin, the Celtics would have an outstanding
club.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a big if,'' Pitino said.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of Doug Overton also might help Barros. Overton is
a veteran point guard, so he and Barros could play together for
stretches in which Barros would be the shooting guard. That would
allow the 5-foot-11-inch Barros to concentrate more on scoring,
something the second-team Bombers seem to need desperately right
now. A long-term solution will be the return of Danny Fortson. The
power forward should be back in a month. That means either Fortson
or Griffin will become a second-teamer.
</P>
<P>
   If that role goes to Fortson, the Squad will not have to worry
about second and third chances because Fortson is a rebounder. If
Griffin goes to the bench, he has shown that he can score and
rebound _ especially rebound _ when necessary.
</P>
<P>
   While scrimmaging with the Celtics' Green Team in Monday's
practice in Waltham, Antoine Walker led a fast break. He looked to
his left and passed to his right, where Barros caught the ball and
put in a nice layup. As the players walked to the sideline, Walker
said, ``Nice finish, Dana.'' He paused and added, ``Finally.'' They
both laughed. Now Barros will try to finish like that in a real
game.

MLS CUP BECOMING A HOT TICKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The weather is cooling but ticket sales are heating up for
Sunday's MLS Cup final at Foxboro Stadium, thanks to D.C. United.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sold 2,500 tickets this morning and I would be surprised if
the crowd isn't more than 40,000,'' Revolution CEO Brian O'Donovan
said. ``This is a dream match, what everyone was hoping to see _ a
rematch of the 1996 final.''
</P>
<P>
   D.C. United qualified for the final for the fourth successive
year, taking a 4-0 victory over Columbus in the Eastern Conference
playoff Saturday. The Los Angeles Galaxy won the Western Conference
title with a 3-1 victory over Dallas Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Both United and the Galaxy have reputations for presenting an
aesthetically pleasing brand of soccer, and both teams have dynamic
attacks, though the Galaxy has changed its emphasis to defense.
</P>
<P>
   This game also will mark the potential of club soccer in the
Boston area. Though the Revolution have attracted crowds of about
17,000 per game, the largest Foxboro Stadium soccer attendances
have been for international matches. The largest crowd for a
stand-alone club match was 38,633 for Columbus's 1-0 victory over
the Revolution on Sept. 21, 1996, the final regular-season game of
the first MLS season
</P>
<P>
   ``The attendance should exceed expectations,'' O'Donovan said.
``If we had been in the playoffs and were competing to be in this
game, it would have made a huge difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we are pleased, since this is a game being played in late
November, in which the local team wasn't near this thing in terms
of generating local excitement. What other sport, other than the
Super Bowl, could have drawn this well under these conditions, with
two teams which aren't from the area? It shows how much people want
soccer here and are willing to go after it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No stopping him
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There was apparently little the MLS or the Revolution could have
done to prevent Joe-Max Moore's move to Everton FC last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I've dreamed about my whole life,'' Moore said
after stopping in Boston on the way to Marrakech to play for the US
national team in an exhibition Wednesday. ``People talk about Serie
A in Italy and the Spanish League, but for me it doesn't get any
better than the Premier League.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of good memories of playing for the Revolution.
Everyone treated me fairly. But this move wasn't about money. I
didn't want to pass up on a chance to play in the Premier League.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore is awaiting a work permit before the transfer is approved.
Moore said he fulfills the requirement of playing at least 75
percent of the US's international matches _ in fact, he has been
called up for 82 percent of the team's games, but was prevented
from playing in some games by injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the English mentality is to work hard, and I've never
seen anyone work harder than me,'' Moore said. ``So I should fit
in. Everton's players are all at a very high level and the guys
work hard every day. The fans expect that from the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their best striker is Kevin Campbell, and I spent some time
with him and he's a great guy. I think I would fit in there right
now. They also have Francis Jeffers, who is injured but is expected
to be the next big player in England. They have quite a few players
at that position, but that's normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore did not have a rewarding experience with the Revolution.
He arrived with the team in a midseason crisis in 1996 and
converted 11 goals in 14 games in nearly leading it to the
playoffs. The Revolution continued to exist on the edge of playoff
elimination the next three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everthing is in place for this to become a championship
franchise,'' Moore said of the Revolution. ``The owners are great,
so is management, and the fans are what I stayed for. But a lot of
things need to happen. Sunil (Gulati, managing director of Kraft
Soccer) knows how to work within the MLS to get players, and then
it will be up to the coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to keep saying it, but we were always close to turning
the corner. It's hard to put a finger on what went wrong. I'm not
sure it was the style of play because we played a fairly good
style; we tried to play good soccer. It just didn't come together
at the right times.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Too much fun
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Paul Scholes will miss the England-Scotland match Wednesday at
Wembley after having been cautioned for excessive celebration after
his second goal in England's 2-0 win over the Scots Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Scholes, a Manchester United midfielder, certainly was justified
in commemorating the success. England is virtually assured of
qualifying for the European Championships next summer in Belgium
and Holland.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, more than 100 fans were arrested for what amounted to
excessive celebration before and after the match at Hampden Park in
Glasgow. No major injuries were reported, and only 10 supporters
were detained overnight, indicating that law enforcement confronted
the situation reasonably well.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland, though, must ignite its offense when it visits Turkey.
The Turks scored a late penalty kick to tie, 1-1, in Dublin. The
Irish strike force will be Tony Cascarino and David Connolly, since

   The Brazil-Nike-Ronaldo connection continues to confound. Brazil
had a game scheduled against Spain in Vigo last weekend and planned
to send the Olympic team to Australia for a game Saturday and one
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   To further confuse matters, coach Wanderley Luxemburgo decided
to join the Olympic team and sent Olympic assistant Candinho to
Vigo with the senior team. Ronaldo wanted to go to Australia, where
local promoters and Nike needed him for promotional purposes, and
where, at age 23, he seemed to fit in well with younger teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Inter protested that Ronaldo was being overworked,
and FIFA upheld the appeal by decreeing that Ronaldo was eligible
for only one game in Australia. Luxemburgo refused to compromise,
saying he wanted Ronaldo for either both games or none.
</P>
<P>
   Then, local hero Harry Kewell of Leeds United failed to appear,
and Manchester United goalkeeper Mark Bosnich was injured.
Promoters ended up giving away tickets to the match. Brazil won,
2-0.

   Romario, the best Brazilian goal-scorer of the decade, could be
available. Flamengo president Edmundo Santos Silva said Romario
would be dropped from the team for _ once again _ excessive
celebration. Romario and four teammates apparently went to a disco
in Caxias do Sul after a 3-1 loss to Juventude eliminated Flamengo
from playoff contention on the final day of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will continue to go out at night,'' Romario said. ``I think
it is very normal that people go out to have fun. I like to go out
and I will always do so, wherever I am.''

CARTER FINALLY CHECKS IN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ After a slow start, things appear to be falling into
place for Anson Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Centering a checking line with Rob DiMaio and P.J. Axelsson, the
6-foot-1-inch, 185-pound Carter has regained a scoring touch that
abandoned him during an anemic eight-game stretch in which he
notched just one assist.
</P>
<P>
   He ended that drought with a goal in last Thursday's overtime
victory over the Maple Leafs and followed up with two goals and two
assists in Saturday's 5-2 win over the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Carter feels the turnaround is just a matter of playing smarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been the key,'' he said, ``I was working hard. But now
I'm playing smarter and the bounces are going my way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't jumping on the loose pucks. I was working hard,
trying to get the puck back, but I was standing around, waiting to
see what Allie (Jason Allison) or Andy (Dave Andreychuk) were going
to do, so I was standing around, not playing the way I'm capable of
playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was waiting, hoping things would happen. When I'm playing
smart, I'm not waiting, I'm attacking the puck in all three zones
and reading the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting used to a new linemate (Andreychuk) also may have had an
effect on his performance early. ``I was trying to figure out what
Andy can do and can't do on the ice, and I'm sure he was doing the
same thing with myself and Allie,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   Carter has had no problem assimilating with DiMaio and Axelsson.
The trio has accounted for five goals and 14 points in the last 10
games, despite shadowing the opponent's best scoring line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offense will come, but that's not our focus right now,''
he said. ``Now it's the day-in and day-out challenge to be prepared
and don't get embarrassed. You're playing against a team's top
players so the chance of getting embarrassed is there every single
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after his outing against the Rangers, Carter downplayed his
scoring. ``I was still trying to keep team goals in focus,'' he
said. ``My main job is to control the tempo and take away the
offense. After the game, you think about it, but during the game,
there's too much going on.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Carter has played center. He played
that position at Michigan State and for a while with the Capitals
before suffering a thumb injury that forced a move to right wing.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pat Burns switched Carter to center at the suggestion of
assistant general manager Mike O'Connell. ``It's worked out fine,''
Burns said. ``He's got the speed, he's got the size, he's got some
determination in him to play against those guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I disagree when anybody tells me anybody can check. It's a
tough role to play, you just don't put someone out there, you have
to work at checking, you have to know your game. You can be a fast
skater and it doesn't mean nothing. You have to know the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter was surprised by his move to the checking and had a rude
awakening in the Bruins' 6-2 setback at Buffalo last Wednesday. ``I
definitely wanted to redeem myself,'' Carter said. ``Coach showed a
lot of faith in me, putting me out there against (Mats) Sundin. But
not one guy makes up that line, all three guys do, that's
important.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to step up and accept the challenge. When the coach
challenges you like that, you want to be able to raise your game to
another level.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ In a span of three hours, the Patriots went
from being potentially the first-place team in the AFC East to the
fourth-place team. Their fourth-quarter comeback fell one score
short in a 24-17 ``Monday Night Football'' loss to the rival New
York Jets as the Patriots once again failed to impress the nation's
football audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best team won tonight,'' said a dejected Drew Bledsoe
after Monday's game. ``There are reasons for it. We definitely had
opportunities. We were inside the 5-yard line twice and we came out
of it with 3 points. Can't do that. Can't turn the ball over three
times and win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't run the ball effectively, didn't convert third downs
and they did. They had an excellent game plan. Al Groh and Bill
Belichick are the two best (defensive coaches) we face every year.
I've said it before: They're the best.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets forced Bledsoe into three interceptions and rode the
play of Ray Lucas, the former Patriot practice-squad receiver
making his second start at quarterback, to a 24-3 fourth-quarter
lead. Another former Patriot, Curtis Martin, ran for 149 yards on
31 carries in a splendid performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels great to come in here and beat the coach that cut
me,'' said Lucas, who passed for 153 yards, completing 18 of 31
attempts, with two touchdowns and two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots looked like a team that had had 15 days off and
couldn't quite recapture its passion _ until the fourth quarter,
when they put two scores on the board. But they were unable to
score on their final three possessions, with Bledsoe going 1 for 9
and their night ending when Tony Simmons dropped a pass on fourth
and 18 with a minute left when he would have had a first down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw it too far behind him and he couldn't turn around and
make the play,'' said Bledsoe. ``There was never a time when I
thought we were going to lose the game. I had confidence all the
way through.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we leave here and have to go to Miami and Buffalo and the
Colts. We have a tough road ahead of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are now 2-4 in Tuna Bowls. They fell into a 21-3
hole at halftime, and things didn't start much better in the third
quarter, as Bledsoe was intercepted twice in the first 6:08.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Marcus Coleman's second interception of the game, at
the Jet 12, was followed on the very next series by linebacker
Marvin Jones's first career pick, at the 15, just as Bledsoe was
driving the Patriots into the red zone.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas, who was given the nod as the fourth Jet signal caller of
the season after a miserable run by Rick Mirer, looked like a
seasoned quarterback. He put together a dream drive of 11:22 across
the third and fourth quarters, moving the Jets 62 yards on 19
plays, to set up John Hall's 26-yard field goal that gave New York
the three-touchdown advantage.
</P>
<P>
   But the Patriots began closing the gap. Bledsoe's 13-yard screen
pass to Kevin Faulk with 10:07 remaining capped a 10-play, 58-yard
drive and made it 24-10. By now, the stadium was half-empty.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots pulled within a touchdown when Bledsoe connected on
a 31-yard pass play with Troy Brown, who faked Ray Mickens at the
15 and pranced into the end zone with 6:58 left. The drive lasted
1:12 and was aided by a fourth-down interference call on Aaron
Glenn against Shawn Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our opportunities,'' said Patriots coach Pete Carroll.
``It took us a while to get adjusted to their defenses. I feared
what would happen after the bye is we wouldn't stay on the even
track we've been on. We're very disappointed we weren't able to do
that tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   In a spirited game with emotions running high, the Jets blitzed
Bledsoe incessantly, taking away his deep receivers and forcing the
Patriots to run, which they couldn't do.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots caught a break late in the first quarter when a
Lucas third-and-8 pass intended for Wayne Chrebet tipped off his
fingers into the hands of Chris Carter, his third interception of
the season, at the New England 36.
</P>
<P>
   But after three plays netted minus-6 yards, Lee Johnson had to
punt into a swirling 30-mile-per-hour wind. His 28-yard kick left
the Jets at their 42.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets, who had been running the majority of the time, went to
the air with the wind at their backs. Lucas led an eight-play,
58-yard drive, connecting with Chrebet for 8 and 26 yards and
capping it with a 1-yard pass to an uncovered Keyshawn Johnson in
the corner of the end zone. Johnson's TD made up for a questionable
interference call on him two plays earlier for pushing off on Law
in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   On the ensuing kickoff, Faulk made his best play as a Patriot to
date, taking Hall's kickoff 3 yards deep in the end zone, breaking
a tackle at the 30, and rambling 95 yards to the Jets' 8, where he
was caught by Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish he could have scored,'' said Carroll. ``We couldn't get
it in.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry Allen (14 carries, 36 yards) ran the ball to the 5 on
first down, then lost a yard on second down. A completion to Allen
got the ball to the 1, but on fourth down, the Patriots tried to
make a statement instead of taking the sure 3 points.
</P>
<P>
   Allen was stuffed by Roman Phifer and Anthony Pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   It was a momentum-turner.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a huge disappointment,'' said Carroll. ``We decided
to go for the touchdown rather than settle for the 3, and it didn't
work there.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Jets' subsequent possession, a 29-yard pass to Chrebet
was overturned on replay. Brown, returning to his punt-return role,
took Tom Tupa's kick back to the Jets' 49. From there, Bledsoe
found Terry Glenn at the 40, and Glenn made a move to the outside
and ran all the way to the 23. Bledsoe then hit Ben Coates for 7
yards, Allen ran for 2, and Jason Ferguson leaped offside on a
third and 1, giving New England first and goal at the 9.
</P>
<P>
   But the Patriots were unable to get it any closer than the 4.
Bledsoe's third-down attempt hit Phifer's backside as he had Coates
covered like a blanket. The Patriots settled for a 22-yard Adam
Vinatieri field goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets made it an extra-embarrassing first half for the
Patriots after taking over at their 42. Lucas hit Johnson on a
pretty 19-yard sideline play, and after a 6-yard loss on a pass to
Martin, Lucas hit Chrebet for 11 yards to the 36. Martin took a
handoff, started up the middle, then cut to the right and was gone,
36 yards for the score with 6:09 remaining in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing, 14-3, the Patriots were backed up to their 15 after a
holding call on Chris Floyd on the kickoff. Bledsoe tried to get it
back in one throw, had Jefferson deep down the field, but he was
throwing against the wind and the ball was knocked down enough for
Coleman to intercept it and run it back to the Patriots' 36.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas, showing great poise, engineered a quick scoring drive,
finishing it by throwing 11 yards to tight end Fred Baxter in front
of Lawyer Milloy, making it 21-3 20 seconds before halftime.

AN ESPECIALLY HUMBLING PERFORMANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Maybe that 2-point win in September wasn't
quite the exorcism Patriots fans thought it was.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night Bill Parcells waddled into Foxboro Stadium with a
team whose hopes long ago had been crushed and which was playing
football without a real quarterback. Waiting for them was a team
that believed it was the best in football. Waiting for them were
Pete Carroll and his New England Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Result? Jets 24, Patriots mystified.
</P>
<P>
   How could the 2-6 Jets come into Carroll's house and steal his
furniture from right in front of his nose with 53 of his best
employees surrounding him? How could those 53 men come off a bye
week and say goodbye to the top of the AFC East by losing to a team
that was life and death with the Arizona Cardinals?
</P>
<P>
   How do they get beat by a quarterback they didn't want, making
only the second start of his career?
</P>
<P>
   How? Because there's nothing special about them.
</P>
<P>
   How do they get run over by a running back they didn't want, a
running back they'd whispered was damaged goods three years (and
approaching three straight 1,000-yard seasons) ago?
</P>
<P>
   How? Because there's nothing special about them.
</P>
<P>
   How do they allow an offense averaging barely 14 points a game
not only to smoke them but to cap the barbecue with a 19-play,
62-yard drive in the second half that lasts 11 minutes 23 seconds?
</P>
<P>
   How? Because there's nothing special about them.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Patriots get back on the field Sunday in Miami,
Carroll and his boss, owner Bob Kraft, will have become tired of
hearing the word ``how.''
</P>
<P>
   That there is nothing special about Carroll and his Patriots is
a fact but not a condemnation. It is simply something they must
recognize and understand, because in this era of NFL mediocrity,
they still can reach the playoffs if they can just bring themselves
to see what they are and come out and play with a feverish fear of
defeat every time.
</P>
<P>
   They did not do that Monday night, and so they got their heads
handed to them by an inferior team that came in with a superior
game plan and the will to execute it. They were beaten as much by
their glowing self-image as they were by the Jets . . . although
the Jets did a pretty good job of it as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We show the mark of a good team when we're down,'' said
cornerback Ty Law. ``We show the energy to come back. But we need
to do that from the first whistle. We know we can play at crunch
time but when there's no pressure we don't play well. That's been
consistent here for several years. I'm awed by it myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Awed and mystified.
</P>
<P>
   The loss technically dropped the Patriots into fourth place in
the AFC East, but so competitive is the division that they are only
a game behind Miami and Indianapolis and a half-game behind the
Bills. Their position in the standings is of little import at the
moment, because they play all three teams in the next four weeks
and thus could right their ship well before Christmas if they can
just make themselves understand one thing.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing special about them.
</P>
<P>
   To do that they cannot go into those games the way they went
into this one. They cannot go in sure of their dominance, because
as Law pointed out and this team has proven time and time again
that the instant it starts thinking it's better than it really is,
it plays worse than it really is.
</P>
<P>
   These Patriots are a team that not only cannot stand success, it
cannot stand even the thought of success. For whatever reason,
Pete's Patriots remain unable to handle prosperity and need to
remind themselves daily of one thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing special about us, there's nothing special
about us.'' They need to keep saying it the way Dorothy kept saying
``There's no place like home'' in ``The Wizard of Oz'' until she
finally got home.
</P>
<P>
   If that becomes their mantra for the next month, they might well
end it atop the AFC East despite such a dismal performance because
there's nothing special about anybody else, either.
</P>
<P>
   There is no shame in this. The NFL has become a league of teams
about whom there is nothing special, and ultimately two of them
have to reach the Super Bowl. One of them still could be the
Patriots if they simply look at this defeat for what it is.
</P>
<P>
   It was a reminder of what a few people have been trying to tell
them for a couple of years now: They're just another team, except
on the days when they decide to fight for their lives. Then they
are more than that.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of slogans like ``We're No. 1'' posted on the locker
room walls, this team needs to put up one that says ``We'd like to
be No. 1 but there's nothing special about us.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of playing a song such as ``We Are the Champions'' on
the PA system, they need to play to ``I'm a Loser and I'm not what
I appear to be.''
</P>
<P>
   If they can do that often enough, the Patriots can survive this
unseemly defeat to Parcells's Jets.
</P>
<P>
   But if they think they got hit by a lucky punch, they're wrong.
Dead wrong, and their playoff hopes will be just as dead if they
don't realize that they got hit by a team not that different from
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   A team that had nothing special about it.

COMPLICATED DIVISION PROBLEM GETS NO EASIER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ As the eternally hapless Chester A. Riley
used to say, ``What a revoltin' development this is!''
</P>
<P>
   Bad? No, this wasn't bad. This was execrable. And why? Bye
Week-itis? Brain lock? The fix perhaps being in? (Just kidding.)
Inexplicable cosmic forces? Or was it that the 2-6 Jets were never
really all that bad and the 6-2 Patriots were never really all that
good?
</P>
<P>
   There is no definitive answer. None. In the weeks to come, we
will all know whether or not this embarrassing 24-17 loss to the
Jets was a bizarre aberration or the beginning of the end. What we
do know is that this turn of events (a) brought a smile to the
faces of Messrs. Jimmy Johnson, Wade Phillips, and Jim Mora and (b)
enabled the hard-luck Jets to salvage a little self-respect.
</P>
<P>
   The only consolation for the Patriots is this: If the Jets
really are as good as they looked in Periods 2 and 3 of this game,
they might be able to do unto others on the schedule as they did to
the stunned Patriots at Foxboro Stadium. Based on what they did
Monday night, the Jets have the capability of being a major problem
for the Dolphins, Bills, and Colts.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the whole thing could have been another kind of
aberration. Is Ray Lucas really a capable NFL quarterback? Maybe,
maybe not. But he was good enough to win a big game. The unarguable
reality is that he outplayed Drew Bledsoe in his own backyard.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers weren't dazzling. He's not going to be AFC Offensive
Player of the Week after completing 18 of 31 passes for 153 yards.
He had two touchdown passes and he had two interceptions. There was
good and there was bad. But under the circumstances it was a
reasonably heroic performance.
</P>
<P>
   Come on, consider the circumstances. Who is Drew Bledsoe? A Pro
Bowl quarterback enjoying his finest pro season, that's who. And
who is Ray Lucas? A utilityman getting his first NFL win against a
team, and coach, that had deemed him superfluous two years ago. In
the '30s and '40s, they used to make a lot of movies on far
flimsier premises than this.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did a nice job,'' said Tom Tupa, the ex-Patriot who punted
seven times for a 45.6-yard average, and who still may be the best
healthy quarterback on the Jets. ``He went out and made plays.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His presence in the huddle was what you'd expect,'' saluted
wide receiver Wayne Chrebet, who caught seven of Lucas's passes,
good for 70 yards. ``He did a tremendous job for us. I know that he
doesn't want to be a backup quarterback. He wants to lead a team.
Tonight he put that pressure on himself, and he came through. It
was a huge win for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The game got away from the Patriots in the second quarter, when
the Jets scored three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first half, it seemed like we had the ball the whole
time,'' observed Tupa.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots tried the same approach that worked many long weeks
ago against the Colts. That is to say, they fell way behind (28-7
on that particular occasion) before compressing all their goodness
into what was an extended two-minute drill. It looked as if the
madcap offensive strategy might work again when they scored twice
in the fourth quarter after falling behind by a 24-3 score. And
when Lawyer Milloy came up with a tipped interception with 5:58
remaining, they were in excellent shape with a first down at the
Jets 27.
</P>
<P>
   But that's where it ended. Bledsoe, in the midst of a Mike
Taliaferro game (15 for 36, 170 yards), threw incompletions to
Shawn Jefferson, Vincent Brisby, Kevin Faulk, and Jefferson again.
They would never again be in a position to accomplish anything on
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Shed not a tear for the home team. How can you excuse a supposed
contender that comes out so pathetically flat in the first game
following a bye? How can you excuse a team that has two separate
first-and-goals from the 5 and comes away with 3 points? You can't.
From a Patriots standpoint, this game was a thorough abomination
that raises serious questions about their overall status. Once
again, those early-season squeakers, including the gift against the
Jets in the Meadowlands, look like nothing less than early
Christmas presents from the Grid God.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets paid proper lip service to the Patriots. After all,
they've got to talk up a win like this. It's only human.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if they took us for granted or not,'' mused
Chrebet. ``They're a good team, but maybe we were a little more
prepared to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets leave here aroused. This is a team that had specialized
in fourth-quarter giveaways. Now it is a team that thinks it has
found a cure. They are looking at this game as proof that it surely
ain't over until it's over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all believe,'' declared Curtis Martin, whose 149 yards on
31 carries included a 36-yard cutback touchdown run in the second
quarter. ``We know this has happened before. Bill (Parcells) has
coached a team that was 2-6 or 3-6 and that wound up making the
playoffs. What this does for us is give us momentum, momentum to
turn the season around.''
</P>
<P>
   Great. Let a new, aggressive fox loose in the AFC East henhouse,
as if things weren't crazy enough in football's toughest division.
</P>
<P>
   Having the Jets back in the mix is bad for everyone else, and
losing this particular game is truly bad, bad, bad for the Patriots
and Pete Carroll. He is now 2-4 in Tuna Bowls. Those inclined to
question him will question him. With two weeks to get ready, his
team looked very unprepared.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, it was a revoltin' development, all right. Now the Patriots
head to Miami, where Jimmy Johnson has already declared war on
mankind. And Chester A. Riley was just a TV character. The Dolphins
are very real.

SPEAKING OF SHORT MEMORIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN LEVINGSTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; You know all is right with the world when you see that Nick
Leeson has hit the lecture circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that fine young chap Nick? He is the fella who worked
in the Singapore office of the distinguished British bank Barings.
He was the futures trader who in 1995 bet wrong on the direction of
Japanese stocks and interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Few people have bet as wrong as Nick did. Young Nick, just 26
years old at the time, ran up a debt of $1.4 billion, which in the
parlance of the casino is a bit more than betting one's shirt, or
the farm, or the ranch, or one's whiskers _ it's even a bit more
than betting one's sweet behind.
</P>
<P>
   In his roll of the dice, Nick went as far as one could go: he
bet the bank and when the numbers went against him, this fine young
chap put an end to Barings, which had been in business for 233
years.
</P>
<P>
   Nick, the working-class boy with the high school education,
wasn't just a bad arbitrageur. He also was clumsy at covering his
tracks. Though he had the doughy white face of an innocent, he
pulled a few fast ones and then, like a boy, he ran when the
authorities found out.
</P>
<P>
   He was captured in Frankfurt and imprisoned for 4 1/2 years in
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was released and returned to London in July of
this year, he'd already sold his story to book publishers and the
newspapers. He'd nearly exhausted his options for rebuilding his
life. After all, he isn't expected to jump back into the financial
casino. Due to his notorious skills, he won't likely be permitted a
license to trade on the London International Financial Futures
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   So what in the world could the fine young chap do?
</P>
<P>
   Why, hit the lecture circuit, of course.
</P>
<P>
   At first I couldn't imagine why 100 Dutch businessmen, brokers
and bankers would pay $300 each to hear young Nick speak in
Amsterdam. More astonishing was why the conference organizers would
pay the bloke $100,000 to stand up and perform.
</P>
<P>
   Then it hit me. This was no run-of-the-mill conference. This was
the Barnum and Bailey of the business big top. And Nick, sweet
Nick, was the circus freak. Step right up, folks, and see the
astounding, the marvelous, the scary, the terrible Boy Scoundrel!
</P>
<P>
   But alas, I was wrong. It was a genuine business conference. I
should never have been surprised that Nick was the honored guest.
Today, sins are committed and soon forgotten. A major life
insurance company agrees to pay a billion dollars to settle claims
it tricked policy holders. Seven of the world's largest drug
companies promise to hand over a billion dollars to resolve charges
they fixed vitamin prices for years. We quickly forget, and
business goes on.
</P>
<P>
   No, it's not surprising that Nick has a series of speaking
engagements booked in coming months. Sweet-faced Nick also will be
appearing in ads to offer his stamp of approval on selected
products.
</P>
<P>
   He even has a media adviser who boasts of his client to the Wall
Street Journal: This man is inundated with offers.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it seems pretty clear that all is right with the world now
that Nick Leeson has hit the lecture circuit.
</P>
<P>
   He committed his sin, and we've quickly forgotten. The time has
come for him to rebuild his shattered life.
</P>
<P>
   But how? He has no more books to peddle and no job. All that
this fine young chap has left is his good name.

HARDER THAN IT LOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; First Jaguar. Now Cambridge University?
</P>
<P>
   When the University of Cambridge and the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology last week announced plans to form a joint institute,
it sounded for all the world like one of those ``dynamic and
challenging partnerships'' that begin with a little shared research
and development and ends in the acquisition of one famous brand by
another.
</P>
<P>
   Impossible, of course, in the case of the two great
universities.
</P>
<P>
   But the close proximity to the deal of Alex Trotman, former
chief executive of Ford Motor Co., was an indication of just how
unusual was the agreement to exchange students and faculty (fifty
juniors a year, for example), perform integrated research, and
otherwise seek to build competitiveness in Britain on the American
model.
</P>
<P>
   Trotman, a Scot and Cambridge grad, worked half his life in the
United Kingdom and the other half in the United States. He was one
of the facilitators of the deal by which Detroit's automotive giant
in 1989 bought Jaguar, England's best car maker, for $2.5 billion.
He was one of the powers behind the MIT-Cambridge deal, and he
hailed its potential ``social and economic benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   When the government of Tony Blair swept into office in 1997, it
was armed with a slogan _ Cool Britannia _ that signaled its
determination to shake up traditional ways. As the first Labor
government in a generation, it had an unusual mandate to foster a
new entrepreneurial culture among the British.
</P>
<P>
   It has proved harder than it looks. Certain British industries
continue to dominate world markets easily enough: news, finance,
fashion, and design. But though UK companiies have promising
positions in high-tech industries from pharmaceuticals to the
Internet, new business formation and productivity gains haven't
been sufficiently forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the Blair government's determination to do something to
shake British attitudes to their roots. After Chancellor of the
Exchequer Gordon Brown visited MIT in early 1998, he set out to
promote a significant intervention in British higher education by
MIT's senior staff.
</P>
<P>
   Brown first proposed hooking up MIT with a consortium of
schools, including Bristol University and the London Business
School. MIT held out for an affiliation with Cambridge University
alone _ or nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Cambridge authorities with backgrounds in the sciences were
happy to explore a joint venture, vice chancellor Sir Alec Broers
in particular. Broers, a computer scientist who for a time was an
IBM senior fellow, has had a string of notable successes in
creating university partnerships at Cambridge _ a Microsoft
software think tank chief among them.
</P>
<P>
   But the 800-year-old university, nestled in the countryside an
hour northeast of London by train, has yet to perfect a reputation
as the central place for European research and development.
Although it was the first university in Europe to establish a
``science park'' to encourage business formation, nothing like the
profusion of new businesses characteristic of Massachusetts has
followed, much less the explosion that is Silicon Valley, and talk
of ``the Cambridge Phenomenon'' is often overblown.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of ``missing links'' in British business culture is not
difficult to find. Indeed, that its engineers are treated as
second- and third-class citizens behind its scientists has been
noted regularly by writers on development for more than a century.
</P>
<P>
   Biology professor Ricard Hynes, who has studied at both
Cambridge and MIT, described the difference this way in an MIT news
release: ``MIT is go-go-go, run-run-run. MIT students like constant
testing. In Cambridge they tend to think around and find the one
way . . . In Cambridge, there is basically one exam every three
years _ you could explore a subject. Also, you had a choice on your
exams.''
</P>
<P>
   When the pact was announced last week in London, you could all
but hear the English molars grinding. The Blair government agreed
to put up 80 percent of the $135 million that would be required for
the first five years; British industry agreed to raise the rest.
The money for the most part would flow to Cambridge, Mass., in
order that the Yanks would serve as ``torchbearers to UK's
enterprise future.'' A few Cambridge dons were furious at the
government, and one promised a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Will it work? Of course it will. Fifty undergraduates at a time.

`POKEMON' SHOVES ASIDE LEADING MEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How is it that Bruce, Brad, Nicolas, and Harrison have gotten
their $20 million butts so thoroughly kicked by Pikachu, Charizard,
Psyduck, and Togepy?
</P>
<P>
   This, after all, is supposed to be the serious season, the
season of Streep and Scorsese when so-called ``adult films''
replace the plot-deprived, big-bang movies of summer. This is
supposed be that heady time when moviegoers turn their fickle heads
toward the kinds of ambitious, thought-provoking films whose names
are expected to be called and called again come Oscar nomination
time.
</P>
<P>
   So why is the biggest film thus far this fall a silly imported
Japanese cartoon aimed at kids?
</P>
<P>
   In less than a week, ``Pokemon: The First Movie,'' has earned
more than $52 million, $32 million this past weekend. It's a
wonderful, though not entirely unexpected, box-office boost, but
make no mistake this has been the autumn of Hollywood's discontent.
</P>
<P>
   A little more than halfway through the fall movie season, and
you can practically see the sweat stains on those well-cut
Hollywood suits. At least a half-dozen heavily hyped releases have
stiffed at the box office in recent weeks. And these are films
starring such box office golden boys as Harrison Ford (``Random
Hearts''), Nicolas Cage (``Bringing Out the Dead,'' directed by
Martin Scorsese), Bruce Willis (``The Story of Us,'' also with
Michelle Pfeiffer), Brad Pitt (``Fight Club,'' costarring Edward
Norton), and Robin Williams (``Jakob the Liar''). Guess all those
positive blurbs from Ron Brewington of American Urban Radio
Networks, and WBAI's Paul Wunder _ those ubiquitous quote machines
who talk in exclamation points and who never saw a big studio
release they didn't like _ have been for naught.
</P>
<P>
   Also disappearing fast is ``Music of the Heart,'' starring Meryl
Streep. So what's the deal? Well, except for ``Fight Club,'' which
was just too gleefully nihilistic for many tastes, none of these
films were very good. (``Music of the Heart'' is OK, but it's also
relentlessly sappy.) Perhaps audiences are finally making it clear
that they need compelling stories, not just lots of star-wattage on
the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, there are still lots of buzzy big releases with big
stars on the horizon, including Jim Carrey as the late, great
comedian Andy Kaufman in ``Man on the Moon,'' Denzel Washington as
wrongly imprisoned boxer Rubin ``Hurricane'' Carter in ``The
Hurricane,'' and Tom Hanks in an adaptation of Stephen King's ``The
Green Mile.'' But, if the first half of the season is any
indication, Hollywood may be in for a long, cold winter.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rumor has it that Aussie actor Russell Crowe, so good as Big
Tobacco whistleblower Jeffrey Wigand in ``The Insider'' (and even
better in ``L.A. Confidential'') is being positioned as the next
Mel Gibson. Geez, let's hope not.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so maybe Fiona Apple can sometimes be a bit of a ninny. Her
minidiatribe at the MTV Video Music Awards a few years back is
near-legendary, and the 90-word title of her new CD, is earning
more than a few exasperated rolls of the eyes. But let no one deny
what a stunning talent she is _ and she's only 22. Her CD, ``When
the Pawn. . .'' is one of the best releases of the year. I, for
one, don't care if she lapses into occasional petulant bratspeak,
so long as she keeps making music this challenging and stirring.
</P>
<P>
   So do you think network execs have tried contacting Charles Van
Doren _ the 1950s quiz show scandal poster boy _ to host one of
these new primetime game shows?
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as part of VH1's ``Divas Week,'' the cable network
aired episodes of Cher's 1970s solo variety show. To wit, there was
Cher performing a medley of Stevie Wonder songs with the Osmonds.
And just when it seemed things couldn't get any weirder, there was
Cher singing a Beatles medley with Tina Turner and Kate Smith _
yes, that's ``God Bless America'' Kate Smith. Man, they just don't
make TV like that anymore.

IN 20 YEARS ARTE PUBLICO HAS MADE AN INDELIBLE MARK ON PUBLISHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (Photo available on NYT database)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRITZ LANHAM  
 c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Book publishing is a tough business. Small houses come
and go.
</P>
<P>
   Big houses get gobbled up by bigger ones.
</P>
<P>
   Arte Publico Press, based at the University of Houston, is one
of the publishing world's success stories. It began with a clear
mission: to provide an outlet for Hispanic authors around the
country. In its first year, it published one book.
</P>
<P>
   As Arte Publico recently celebrated its 20th birthday with a
gala, the number of titles in its catalog has swollen to 275.
``Indispensable,'' is the word respected novelist and Arte Publico
author Rolando Hinojosa uses to describe the press' impact on
Latino literature in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Nicolas Kanellos, founder and director of Arte Publico, is a
54-year-old professor of modern and classical languages at UH and a
tireless, articulate advocate for the work of American Hispanic
authors.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in his modest office, part of a rabbit warren Arte
Publico occupies in the Cullen Performance Hall, he explains that
he started the press because Hispanic authors simply weren't being
published by mainstream houses.
</P>
<P>
   The books that were being published, such as Piri Thomas' ``Down
These Mean Streets,'' were autobiographical accounts of gang life
or impoverished upbringings, describing a relatively narrow range
of experience.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, teaching in Gary, Ind., Kanellos founded a literary
magazine, Revista Chicano-Riqueno. That journal, which still exists
under the title The Americas Review, gave Latino writers an avenue
to a largely academic audience.
</P>
<P>
   But a more important development came with the late-1970s rise
of ethnic studies courses in colleges and universities. Students
and teachers needed course material, and that meant books.
</P>
<P>
   Kanellos seized the opportunity, and in 1979 founded Arte
Publico Press.
</P>
<P>
   The debut title: ``La Carreta Made a U-Turn,'' a collection of
poetry by Tato Laviera.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980 Kanellos received an offer to move to the University of
Houston and bring the press with him. That year the number of new
releases rose to three.
</P>
<P>
   Today the press publishes 30 to 35 titles a year, about 85
percent in English and the rest in Spanish. Most are released as
trade paperback originals. Unlike commercial publishers, Arte
Publico keeps virtually all of its titles in print. For example,
you can still order a copy of ``La Carreta Made a U-Turn,'' now in
a second edition.
</P>
<P>
   Although Arte Publico originally focused on literary fiction and
poetry, it has broadened its range. Today the catalog includes
detective novels, memoirs, history, reference works, books for
teen-agers and picture books for children, as well as poetry and
literary fiction.
</P>
<P>
   The nonfiction list emphasizes history and the Hispanic
civil-rights movement ``because they're areas that have not really
been plumbed and are critical for the development of Hispanic
identity in the United States,'' Kanellos says.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 the press released ``The Handbook of Hispanic Culture in
the United States,'' a much-praised four-volume reference work.
</P>
<P>
   Less weighty fare includes such crime novels as Hinojosa's 1998
``Ask a Policeman,'' set on the Texas-Mexico border, or Lucha
Corpi's series featuring the sleuth Gloria Damasco, the latest of
which, ``Black Widow's Wardrobe,'' came out in September. But
Kanellos says the press won't publish fiction that lacks literary
heft.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Lucha writes a crime novel, she sets it in a historical
context and quite often goes deep into culture. ''Black Widow's
Wardrobe`` is set during the Day of the Dead and explores myth and
history that go back to pre-Columbian Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't publish just a formula book.''
</P>
<P>
   Children's literature is an area of growing importance.
Bilingual picture books, books for families, literacy programs and
children of all ages are issued under the Pinata Books imprint,
started in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Arte Publico also tours writers in schools. In 1998 the press
sponsored 170 such visits coast to coast. In Houston, Kanellos
estimates, Arte Publico authors visit 40 or 50 classrooms a year.
</P>
<P>
   While Arte Publico's largest audience remains college students,
particularly in Hispanic history and literature courses, about 40
percent of the press's sales come from general bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I assume we're reaching general audiences, probably more
heavily Hispanic, but I don't know,'' Kanellos says. Not
surprisingly, given its large Latino population, California is the
largest market for Arte Publico books.
</P>
<P>
   This year the press has taken a big step outside traditional
academic publishing and started putting its books on spinner racks
in grocery stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in about 30 or 35 Krogers and Fiestas in Houston, and we
just went into Dallas through Kroger. Our goal is to get up to
about 300 throughout Texas and go into San Antonio and the
Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   The experiment seems to be working. About two-thirds of the
books put on the racks are sold. Wholesalers tell Kanellos that's a
very good rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could be a cash cow,'' he says cheerfully.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of the press has been gradual, though things did pick
up steam in the early 1990s as the debate grew over whether the
literary canon featured too many dead white males and too few
black, brown and female writers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wall Street Journal ran a headline stating that the great
books were being replaced by the not-so great,'' Kanellos says,
laughing. ``They were talking about our books, as well as others by
African-American and Asian-American writers. So word was getting
out that there were these books available.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over Victor Villasenor's ``Rain of Gold'' also
helped put Arte Publico on the map, in part by getting large
distributors interested.
</P>
<P>
   Dutton, a major New York house, had contracted to publish the
family saga, but insisted that Villasenor cut the manuscript,
retitle it ``Rio Grande'' and market it as fiction.

QUIET KOPIN'S TECHNOLOGY SET TO MAKE NOISE AT LAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kopin Corp. is a small technology company with no profits and a
stock that has tripled in price since June.
</P>
<P>
   An Internet company, right? Wrong. Internet companies are born
hot. Kopin, of Taunton, Mass., has been plugging away for 15 years,
mostly in obscurity. It has taken that long for the company's
scientists to find real world applications for their Buck Rogers
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our technology was ahead of the market,'' says John
Fan, Kopin's patient founder and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Fan and a handful of others left MIT's Lincoln Laboratories in
1984 to start Kopin. Their goal was to make semiconductors using a
technique with parallels to genetic engineering. Like their
counterparts in biotechnology, they found the task more difficult
than they imagined.
</P>
<P>
   The company went public in 1992 and didn't come out with its
first product until 1995; its second product debuted in 1997. Kopin
has never had a profitable year. But that may be about to change.
The small group of analysts who follow Kopin's fortunes predict the
company will mark the new millennium with its first-ever profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is real demand for what they make now,'' says Joel Pitt,
an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston. ``We are not talking
about something that is still around the corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Kopin's main product is _ take a deep breath _ a heterojunction
bipolar transistor wafer. It is called HBT for short. Kopin's
customers use the wafers in the production of semiconductors that,
in turn, are used in cellular telephones. The net result, says Fan,
are phones that have clearer signals.
</P>
<P>
   The cellular business is hotter than hot. Qualcomm, a California
wireless company and a leader in the field, has seen its stock
appreciate 1,400 percent this year. Other companies in the same
business, including some of Kopin's customers, are also basking in
the market's warm glow.
</P>
<P>
   Kopin's HBT business is heating up too. SunTrust Equitable
Securities estimates that wafer sales will reach $28 million this
year and $50 million next. The business is already profitable, say
analysts, and Kopin is in the process of quadrupling its capacity
to make wafers.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the real Buck Rogers business: cyber displays,
miniature high-resolution displays for consumer electronics. Kopin
makes a display with a 1/4-inch diagonal screen. We're talking
about a display smaller than the fingernail on your pinkie.
</P>
<P>
   Kopin has been teasing and disappointing investors for years
with prospects for this business. The goal, or what analyst J. D.
Abouchar of Preferred Capital Markets calls the ``holy grail,'' has
always been a cellular phone with a tiny display that will let the
user see all sorts of information.
</P>
<P>
   The grail is still out of reach, says Abouchar, but in the
meantime Kopin has found other markets for its products. Kopin
displays are currently being used as viewfinders on camcorders and
viewfinders on brand new digital cameras. Down the road, the
cellular phone market may yet develop. Even without it, analysts
expect good growth for Kopin's displays and possibly even profits
by later next year.
</P>
<P>
   If we were really smart market columnists, we would have told
you about Kopin in the spring. The stock has gone from 13 1/16 in
late March to 60 3/4 Monday. But hey, what do you expect for your
50 cents?
</P>
<P>
   The question to be asked now is: Can Kopin actually deliver the
results to justify its market value of close to $900 million? It is
one thing to have potential. It is quite another to win contracts,
build products, and make the trains run on time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is ever certain,'' says William Becklean of SunTrust,
who nonetheless recommended Kopin in a recent report that put a
target price on the stock of 69.
</P>
<P>
   John Fan concedes the company is facing new challenges, but he
says Kopin is ready. Fan certainly must be. At 55 he has had a
chance to watch entrepreneurs half his age make overnight fortunes.
After 15 years, Fan's stake in Kopin is worth only $15 million,
pocket change by today's high-tech standards.
</P>
<P>
   Fan laughs when asked how he feels about the Internet
multimillionaires. ``I have an Asian background,'' he says. ``We
never compare people. I am happy for those companies that are very
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   And as for Kopin, ``In general, we are happy where we are now,''
says Fan.

<P>
   After 15 years, New England ski areas make the point in winters
like the last one: Guaranteed skiing is real.
</P>
<P>
   On those slushy, foggy Fridays that seemed to doom so many
weekends last season, most fair-minded skiers who did make the trek
were forced to admit that almost every weekend the skiing was
pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   A vague term, to be sure. To some, the first scrape of steel
edge on hardpack constitutes terrible conditions. Or, regardless of
the surface, if it rains, snows, or even in flat light, some skiers
will complain that the skiing was not worth the ticket price.
</P>
<P>
   But again, those who make the extra push to get out onto the
snow throughout a New England winter will recognize that the skiing
is almost always better than bad weather leads them to expect.
</P>
<P>
   Our smattering review of New England resorts this year starts in
Vermont with the biggie in the east, Killington. To understand the
scale of this American Ski Company holding in Sherburn
(800-245-7669), imagine 300 snowmaking guns. That's how many
Killington bought this year just to beef up the system.
</P>
<P>
   If you hate crowds, the big K is not for you on weekends, though
weekdays, especially in January, skiers and boarders have the run
of the entire multi-peak, 200-trail area. Killington has by far the
most complete mix of offerings _ from cruisy, white-paved
boulevards, to VW-size moguls, steep and deep, off-piste glade
skiing without equal _ and does each extreme well.
</P>
<P>
   The apres-ski life is the biggest and most raucous it gets this
side of Aspen, as the access road fairly vibrates with rhythm into
the long winter nights. New this year is a much-needed enlarged
base lodge at the original base area. An easy drive from Boston _
Interstate 93 to Interstate 89 at Bow; at White River Junction take
Route 4 west to Shelburn.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of Stratton Mountain (802-297-2200) in southern Vermont
will be pleased to find a new lift access to the summit, one of the
major drawbacks to skier flow at this area. Both of the old slow
lifts _ Grizzly and North American _ are gone, replaced by a
high-speed six-pack that rounds out duty with the gondola.
</P>
<P>
   Also new for this year at Stratton is a beefed-up snowmaking
system, also needed, and part of the area's long-range plan to
bring total coverage to the entire mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Owned by ASC rival, Intrawest, Stratton's niche is high-comfort
resort living with groomed, cruisy skiing, spiced up by forays into
the off-piste terrain. In the main, Stratton is for skiers who like
their runs smooth, fast, and without surprises. It's fast
ego-building skiing, just the kind you want someone to catch on a
videocam. In very cold weather, one of Stratton's best features is
the Sunbowl which, like its name, is a warm pocket out of the
prevailing winter wind. One hint: Skiers wishing to avoid crowds,
drive through town and pick up the road to Sunbowl on the right.
This is a good bypass. Dining is a good range, soup'n'pizza to
gourmet.
</P>
<P>
   Sandwiched between the two giants is Okemo in Ludlow. Well noted
for its grooming and buffed surfaces, Okemo is a true intermediate
mountain with endless cruising runs, some of them steep enough to
get up to gliding speeds and long enough to give skiers a feeling
of having skied a downhill race. While some attempts have been made
to spice up the terrain offerings with relative steeps like Double
Diamond and Outrage, these are tough in name only; at bottom, Okemo
is comfortable for what it does and does better than most. This is
low-stress skiing, with a way down from every lift for every skier.
</P>
<P>
   As an accent to this skiing and boarding comfort zone one feels
at Okemo is the fact that the area has enough slopeside condo
housing to make ski-in ski-out possible for almost every visitor.
Downtown Ludlow is still a piece of lovely, authentic Vermont. The
restaurants and apres-ski establishments _ many appropriate for
underage kids _ give the village an upscale feel of Woodstock and
Stowe. Scenery around the Black River is wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying on the theme of easy, low-stress skiing in a very
comfortable environment, Bretton Woods still captures the niche as
well as any area in New Hampshire. Located just above Franconia
Notch in the White Mountains, this area is making some big-time
moves.
</P>
<P>
   First, the completion of renovations to the famed Mount
Washington Hotel _ across the road from the ski area _ adds a
sudden infusion of big-market possibilities to what was always a
genial skiing backwater.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the hotel winterization comes the first expansion to
the alpine ski area with the addition of West Mountain, which
brings the area to more than 330 skiable acres. The new terrain is
gladed and designed to give skiers somewhat steeper terrain than
one is used to at the area. This is just the beginning of an
expansion aimed at transforming Bretton Woods into the major
leagues of New Hampshire resorts. More is coming on the alpine
side, and the nordic mix _ Bretton Woods being a premier area in
New England _ makes this a future destination.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bretton Woods' proximity to Cannon and even Loon
offer alternatives to people skiing the region for several days.
Transferable and packaged ticketing is possible.
</P>
<P>
   Though years of buffing out the trail system may have taken much
of the snarl out of Wildcat in Gorham _ Pinkham Notch _ this
4,000-foot peak that looks across to Tuckerman Ravine on Mount
Washington, gives advanced skiers everything they want in a full
day of skiing.
</P>
<P>
   The 2,000-foot vertical is easily accessible by intermediate
skiers. Many of the trails have an old New England feel of narrow
switchbackers down a steep mountain side. Others take the fall line
more directly and swiftly. And Lift Lion has moguls that will take
the tuck out of the best bumpster on the hill.
</P>
<P>
   Wildcat has improved its lift capacity with a detachable quad,
has beefed up snowmaking some, and still maintains one of the more
competitive pricing structures in the region (800-255-6439).
</P>
<P>
   A short drive outside hopping North Conway lies Attitash/Bear
Peak. In a more quiet way than most of ASC holdings, this area has
also transformed itself over the years, like so many Les Otten
properties.
</P>
<P>
   Like Wildcat, the area still has plenty of terrain steeped in
the Olde New England feel _ narrow twisters through the woods, fun
to make turns on. But with the addition several years ago of Bear
Peak, the area added a whole new feel. Like flagship Sunday River
with its ever-horizontal expansion, Bear Peak did not add vertical,
but gives Attitash a wide-open cruisy feel of a more modern area.
Though 300 feet less vertical than Attitash, Bear Peak is less
chopped up, with much longer, undulating runs.
</P>
<P>
   The proximity to North Conway says it all about the dining and
apres-ski possibilities, but they can start closer to where you
kick off your boots _ at Margueritaville just down the road.
</P>
<P>
   In Maine, the two great rivals, now corporate bedfellows _
Sugarloaf and Sunday River _ (though well off the beaten path of
the New York skiers who give Vermont areas their reputations in
skier feedback magazine columns) constitute the best skiing in the
East. Sunday River consistently makes and grooms snow well enough
for early season openings, and has never forgotten its mission of
getting the product down on the hill.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most popular ski areas in New England, with a decided
Boston base, what Sunday River lacks in big boney vertical terrain,
it makes up for in horizontal expansion and tremendous terrain
variety. The eight peaks contain 126 trails and 654 acres, and it
can take half a day to ski (and ride lifts) getting from Jordan
Bowl at one end to Barker at the other.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday River has excellent slopeside housing options, improving
dining and apres-ski amenities, but not on a scale with some of the
well-established destination resorts.
</P>
<P>
   Further northwest is just such a resort in Sugarloaf. With a
2,800-foot vertical with more than 1,400 skiable acres and the only
above-treeline skiing in the East, Sugarloaf wins a prize in the
largest/highest/longest competition.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Sugarloaf, now with much improved snowmaking and its
high-speed quad, new trail additions, and this year a 1,000-foot
lift-served tubing park _ has answered many of its old critics.
Thanks to an infusion of ASC development money, the Loaf simply
improves yearly as a destination resort _ as it had to do since
it's so far from anything else.
</P>
<P>
   The expert terrain is nonpareil in New England, the cruising is
wondrous, leaving skiers to choose either skiing the upper half or
top-to-bottom runs like Tote Road than push three miles of rolling,
undulating terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Night life is spread around a number of good bars and
restaurants, ranging from spaghetti-benders like Hugs to true
four-star gourmet in One Stanley Avenue. For more info call
800-843-5623.

 HOUSTON: x x x market it as fiction.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The California-based Villasenor gave back his $75,000 advance
and took his manuscript to Arte Publico, which published ``Rain of
Gold'' in 1991 as its first hardcover. The book remains in print in
hardcover from Arte Publico and in paperback from Bantam.
</P>
<P>
   ```The Rain of Gold' experience was crucial for us, because it
taught us how to publish a hardcover release and really slug it out
with the big boys,'' Kanellos says.
</P>
<P>
   The book was a regional best seller, but the press encountered
resistance when trying to sell nationwide. Some parts of the
country simply weren't receptive to Latino literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``One wholesaler didn't take `Rain of Gold' because the cover
was, quote, too ethnic, unquote,'' Kanellos says. The lucrative
Northeast market in particular is tough to crack for Hispanic
writers, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Of the manuscripts Arte Publico publishes, about 30 percent to
40 percent are submitted by literary agents. But Arte Publico is
``one of the few presses that still opens the mail,'' Kanellos
says, which means its editors actually look at unsolicited
material. He estimates that another 30 percent to 40 percent of
Arte Publico titles come ``over the transom,'' in the phrase of the
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Graciela Limon's ``In Search of Bernabe'' (1993), winner of an
American Book Award, is one over-the-transom title that has done
well. Last spring Limon published ``The Day of the Moon,'' her
fourth book with Arte Publico.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder come from authors who have become part of the Arte
Publico ``stable.'' Poet Pat Mora, children's author Judith Ortiz
Cofer and novelist Nicholasa Mohr are among that number.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether the press gets more than 2,000 submissions each year
for its 30 to 35 publishing slots, Kanellos says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We invest in (new authors), which is hard. The hardest part of
publishing fiction is launching that first book, when nobody knows
the author.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite often that first book goes down the drain and you don't
sell anything. So when we do this we have to be thinking about the
second book, and that works out quite often.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the best-known authors who have published with Arte
Publico are poet Sandra Cisneros and novelists Ana Castillo and
Julia Alvarez.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds to three-fourths of Arte Publico books are by
Mexican-American authors. But the press is stretching into
Cuban-American literature simply because so many new young writers,
like Florida's Virgil Suarez, are producing good material.
</P>
<P>
   And the press has embarked on a project to reprint all the
fiction of Jose Yglesias, an important Cuban-American writer who
died in 1995 and who wrote more than a dozen books of fiction and
nonfiction beginning in the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   A relatively small number of titles by Puerto Rican writers
fills out the catalog.
</P>
<P>
   The press has 16 full-time and more than 20 part-time staff
members.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues from books total more than $1 million a year. The press
also receives grant support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to break even every year as a nonprofit
(organization),'' Kanellos says. ``Most years we break even and
bank a little bit. A couple years we ran a deficit.''
</P>
<P>
   Arte Publico aggressively advertises itself as ``the oldest and
largest publisher of U.S. Hispanic literature.'' Kanellos says only
two other publishers in the country share the same mission_
Bilingual Press at Arizona State University in Tempe and a Cuban
exile publisher in Miami, Ediciones Universal, which publishes only
in Spanish. (The Pittsburgh-based journal Latin American Literary
Review publishes six or seven titles a year in translation.) Among
the press' most important activities is the Recovering the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic Literary Heritage Project.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning of his career, Kanellos realized that
American Hispanics had produced a vast amount of literature over
the centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, much of it was, if not lost, at least
unavailable, sitting uncataloged in archives or squirreled away in
people's attics.
</P>
<P>
   Americo Paredes, the great folklorist with whom Kanellos studied
as a doctoral student at the University of Texas, pointed out the
importance of Spanish-language newspapers, which published stories,
essays and poetry as well as traditional journalism. Paredes
himself first published poetry in San Antonio and Brownsville
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody should try to find those old papers, Paredes said.
</P>
<P>
   But it really wasn't until the mid-1980s that the cohort of
scholars specializing in Latino culture was large enough and had
enough clout in academia to launch a major research project to
recover lost Hispanic literature. By the early 1990s the advent of
the Internet made researching this material much easier.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, funding from the Rockefeller Foundation helped launch
Recovering the U.S. Hispanic Literary Heritage Project. Its goal:
``to locate, identify, preserve and make accessible the literary
contributions of U.S. Hispanics from colonial times through 1960 in
what today comprises the 50 states of the Union.''
</P>
<P>
   One part of the project is to find, microfilm and make available
through the Internet the poetry, fiction, essays, plays and
editorials published in some 900 Spanish-language newspapers.
Altogether, Kanellos says, some 2,400 newspapers were published by
Hispanic communities between 1808 and 1960.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mission of the newspaper was greater than, for instance, a
newspaper in Mexico City or Madrid or Havana,'' Kanellos says. ``In
this immigrant or native community the mission was to preserve the
language and the culture. (That was) stated very clearly. And they
felt that the highest model was literary.''
</P>
<P>
   The project funds visits archives by scholars, who catalog and
index any written material that could classify as Hispanic
literature, from botanical treatises to novels. Kanellos estimates
that a thousand people nationwide are involved in the recovery
project.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the material will be published only in electronic form,
but Arte Publico currently has in print 15 books that also serve as
examples of recovered literature. These include Leonor Villegas de
Magnon's ``The Rebel,'' a never-published autobiography written in
the 1920s by a Mexican-American feminist who served as a nurse in
the Mexican Revolution. The manuscript was found in the Houston
home of Villegas' descendants.
</P>
<P>
   There's also Miguel Antonio Otero Jr.'s early biography of
gunfighter Billy the Kid and Mara Amparo Ruiz de Burton's novel
``The Squatter and the Don,'' published in 1885 and offering
insight into the response of California Mexicans to the U.S.
acquisition of California after the Mexican-American War.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the impact of the project, Kanellos says, ``It has
helped us understand how the (Hispanic) community organized itself
over the history of the United States and how the culture was
created and seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanellos is upbeat about the prospects of the Recovery Project
and of Arte Publico Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 20 years you know you can survive, you know you can make
up for your mistakes,'' he says. ``Our mission is clear, and there
will be a mission for us for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   That mission ranges beyond publishing books for classrooms and
general readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ultimate goal is hemispheric integration,'' he says. ``We
believe in the New World identity, rather than (the idea) of the
United States being a simulacrum of Europe. We believe that the
United States is part of this hemisphere and needs to identify and
recognize common ground with the rest of the Americas.''

SKIWEAR: HIGH-TECH YET NOSTALGIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIE HATFIELD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While ski clothes continue to move toward the millennium by
growing ever more technical, warmer, dryer, and cozier, they're
beginning to look back toward the good old things of the past as
well, embracing touches that were part of skiwear years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Parkas and pants, for example, this ski season will employ all
the bells and whistles of high-tech fabrics, becoming stronger and
tougher and withstanding more snow and sleet and wind than ever.
Obermeyer, out of Aspen, is making pants and shells and jackets in
a 3,000-miller laminate fabric that breathes so well that its
manufacturers discovered that to do it in a parka weight, which has
more insulation than a jacket, would be useless. A parka was too
warm, and too insulated, they found. Employees from the company who
tried such parkas out last January came back in, saying they were
too warm to ski.
</P>
<P>
   The best-selling men's ski parka this season at St. Moritz
Sports in Wellesley is the ``Alaska,'' made by Killy. It is a
high-end technical line with numerous panels, and the more panels a
jacket has, the better it fits. The parka, in a micro fabric in
black, silver, and white, fits like a glove and it is, of course,
waterproof and windproof and costs $598 as the top of the Killy
line. A similar Killy jacket for men sold out by the beginning of
December last year at St. Moritz. The store had ordered 30 of them.
The Alaska is the jacket that Paul Turner, clothing manager of the
store, has chosen as his ski parka for the season, which speaks
well for its success. Even the Gore-Tex in the Alaska is softer and
more supple than untreated Gore-Tex in its native state, which is
thin and crispy.
</P>
<P>
   A word to the wise concerning Gore-Tex, by the way. Now that
skiers know enough to ask for it by name, they don't need to,
because the material is now being made by any number of
manufacturers under different names. The problem is, if you ask for
it by name, you might pay as much as $100 more because of that
name, while most skiwear now has identical fabric inside. But
because other manufacturers are not allowed to use the name, they
don't charge as much. Parkas by Marmot, for example, have a
material with Gore-Tex-like qualities, but at $289 and $399, the
jackets are much less expensive than the Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The Alaska is a three-quarter-length jacket that cinches at the
waist and fits taller, thinner men better than the ``Eisenhower
cut'' Killy jacket, which is cut wider in the shoulders, is
slightly shorter, and is a better choice for the shorter, stockier
man.
</P>
<P>
   The B-line of Killy jackets is as good technologically, but at
$528 they do not have quite as much detailing. The collar that is
leather in the Alaska, for example, is made of fabric in the B-line
jackets. All of these jackets, however, have a back pleat that
makes it more comfortable for the active man who moves his
shoulders as he skis.
</P>
<P>
   Single-color parkas in navy or red are more suitable for the
35-year-old-plus conservative man who doesn't want his jacket to
scream ``skier.'' These come in the $450 and $448 range. Newer
colors from Obermeyer include bright pistachio green, mango yellow,
Dijon mustard, and columbine blue.
</P>
<P>
   Spyder, the company sponsoring the US Ski Team this year, is
known for its distinctive spider web logo on its ski clothing. The
men's Spyder jacket, with a two-tone spider web pattern on one
corner, is known as a very rugged jacket, and at $320 is selling
very well this year. Spyder also makes ``windstopper'' fleece
sweaters with snowflake patterns, consisting of an acrylic and wool
body lined with windproof material, and at $249 can be used in lieu
of a ski shell, weather permitting.
</P>
<P>
   Spyder has had great success with its spider-logo ski clothing
in women's and children's versions as well. You can find hats in
both baseball and wool skullcap style, and many parkas feature a
tiny spider encased in a hologram running across the back of the
jacket. A children's unisex item that is flying out of the stores
already is the white cotton turtleneck shirt with zip front and a
huge red and black spider web across the front. At $35, 30 of these
were sold in four days at St. Moritz Sports. Another popular
children's line is the Back Hill line of Burton Snowboards, with a
stinging hornet logo. Popular colors are lime and navy.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most popular women's Killy items is the black short
jacket with zip-off sleeves that can turn it into a vest. At $438,
Turner notes that ``I never hear a bad thing about it once it has
been sold.'' There's also a new four-way stretch pant for women
with Gore-Tex that is windproof and waterproof and, at $245, ``a
very warm pant,'' according to the manager.
</P>
<P>
   Helly Hansen's skiwear comes from a heritage of sailing, so that
it is not only windproof and waterproof but practically
indestructible. Designed in Europe, the women's jackets are ahead
of the fashion trends and are tending more to soft pastels this
year, including a beautiful baby aqua color. There's a white ski
pant, which is, as is everything else in the store, machine
washable, and there are more and more fleece items, including a
black fleece turtleneck by Marmot.
</P>
<P>
   But fleece can't be made into interesting patterns, and that's
partly why good old tight-weave sweaters are coming back into the
ski picture. Nils Skiwear makes a beautiful women's sweater in soft
blue with a border of black and white snowflakes down the zip
front. The sweater also has a black-lined wool hood, and costs
$150.
</P>
<P>
   The newest look in Obermeyer's women's skiwear is the ``Ladies
Sporto'' suit called The Enforcer, which is a flax- white suit with
a vest worn over it in different colors. The suit is in a European
cut with wide shoulders and a close fit through the body and legs.
It has a lot of features for a suit under $300, including plenty of
Thermolite, a DuPont fabric that keeps you warm.
</P>
<P>
   Another fashion forward look from Obermeyer for women is a down
parka of Luminex rubber. It comes in pistachio, columbine blue,
black, and white.
</P>
<P>
   The tried and true Norwegian sweater has returned in a big way.
Dale of Norway, which is making sweaters for both the US and the
Norwegian ski teams this year, makes wonderful ones of 100 percent
wool, with hangtags that tell stories of Norwegian explorers and
make you feel good about buying them, at $199. The Fridtjof Nansen
model, for example, is named after a polar hero and explorer who
won a Nobel Peace Prize in 1922 for his humanitarian achievement
with the Norwegian Refugee Council. Part of what you pay for the
sweater goes toward the council to support refugees and human
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Every Norwegian sweater pattern, as every Scotch plaid, tells a
story of a certain clan, and these are all in traditional Norwegian
family patterns, recognizable to those in the know, simply works of
art to those who aren't. These may look like the same ski sweaters
that your parents wore, but even Norwegian sweaters must move
forward, and you can get a windstopper version in the same
traditional patterns but with a lining for that purpose, for $280.
</P>
<P>
   The two newest items in skiwear are for the head and the feet.
Bandit Headwear makes a clever headband that keeps your head warm
and also has a slot sewn into the sides for your sun- or
eyeglasses, so that they don't slip.
</P>
<P>
   The newest things for apres-ski cold feet are the Merrell Snow
Clogs, made of Polartek, a structural fleece, with soft cushy
insides and tough rubber bumpy soles. They come in ``jungle slide''
or clog style, or ``winter moc'' style, in brown, black, or dark
green, are for men and women, and cost $55 and $65. Women who first
see the clunky shoes in the store, Turner says, remark, ``These are
the ugliest things I've ever seen.'' When they try them on, they
say, ``These are the most comfortable things I've ever worn.'' He
sold three pairs as he was putting them out on the selling floor
this fall and calls them ``a wonderful alternative to boots.''
</P>
<P>
   Obermeyer skiwear can be found at Bob Smith Wilderness House and
The Ski Market, or by calling 800-525-4203, or at

UTAH AND THE OLYMPICS: A GOOD FIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years from now the Winter Olympics return to the United
States for the first time since 1980 when Lake Placid was host. As
magical a place as that Adirondack hideaway may be, with that
steeped-in-history feel, Placid even 20 years ago seemed strained
to the breaking point as host for such a worldwide event. Memories,
however, remain warm _ Eric Heiden's five gold medals, and the US
hockey team's upset win over Russia's Red Army.
</P>
<P>
   But in 2002 when Salt Lake City hosts the Winter Games, the look
is very different, and Utah could not be a more fitting region.
Already a World Cup Skiing city, Park City has real mountains,
demanding courses, and something no other part of the world has yet
been able to guarantee _ from the Eastern United States to western
Canada to Europe to Japan: consistent snow. All the rest of the
skiing venues in the state can make the same claim.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as many Utah ski fans have pointed out the worst thing
that can happen in this part of the central Rockies is too much
snow. But compared to too much rain in Nagano and too much warm
chinook wind in Calgary, and snow droughts in Europe, we'll take
our chances with Utah's embarrassment of riches _ that is, heavy on
the champagne powder.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Utah one of the greatest prospective Olympic venues
perhaps in the whole 78-year history of the Winter Games that began
in Chamonix, France, also makes the state one of the best
destinations for winter vacationers. To be sure, much of the nearly
$800 million invested in the games will show up on the slopes.
Following are some thumbnails of Utah skiing.
</P>
<P>
   We start with The Canyons (435-649-5400) because most people
have never heard of the area _ yet. That's because in its modern
incarnation as the newest American Skiing Company resort, The
Canyons is just entering its third season. In that time, The
Canyons _ once known as Park West _ has undergone one of the most
amazing transformations ever wrought on ski country.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with the numbers, The Canyons has added 1,200 skiable
acres to a total of 3,300 acres _ one of the largest ski areas in
North America. Last season was the coup de grace for the area,
which opened 800 new acres of expert terrain served by the Ninety
Nine 90 express quad chair that will keep the terrain set aside
fairly exclusively for skiers who belong there _ truly advanced.
</P>
<P>
   So large and varied is The Canyons that every level of skier
will find, not just some terrain, but a bewildering amount of it.
Skiing spread throughout the peaks, ridges, bowls, and chutes of
The Canyons offers every exposure, terrain, and surface. There are
groomed smoothies for those intermediates still working on those
turns before kicking it up to the open bowls and glades where
skiers find the famous Utah ``cold smoke'' powder and wear bandanas
over their mouths to keep from breathing it in.
</P>
<P>
   If it's size and variety any ski group is looking for, The
Canyons, simply put, covers every possible offering with so much
terrain that no one will ever feel the repetitiveness that marks
lesser mountains and ski areas.
</P>
<P>
   Off slope, the infrastructure is coming. This year ASC will open
a new 360-unit hotel in the center of a slopeside village, with
three new restaurants ready for the pre-Olympic explorers checking
out this newest jewel in the Rocky Mountain firmament.
</P>
<P>
   Another relatively new area in the state is Snowbasin
(801-399-1135), generally known to locals in the Ogden region. But
four new high-speed lifts put in for the Olympics to access the
upper reaches of this steep area have put Snowbasin on a much
different competitive footing.
</P>
<P>
   The new lifts access enough new terrain to give this now-large
area 3,200 skiable acres, many of them in the steep and deep
country that Utah powder hounds crave. Allen's Peak, a 1,000-acre
highland once unaccessible, is now easy to reach. Same with
Strawberry Bowl with its new 1,000-plus acres.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago there was a serious lack of FIS downhill courses in
the United States, leading to an embarrassingly feeble downhill
course at Vail's 1989 World Alpine Championships. Last year, a
decade later, Vail had built the awesome Birds of Prey course, as
tough as any in the world. But not to be outdone, Snowbasin, site
of the 2002 Olympic men's downhill, has also built a croaker of a
course, one that gets the attention _ and praises _ of the toughest
Austrian flyboy. The top of the course is so steep that Hermann
Maier and the boys will accelerate to 85 miles per hour six seconds
out of the starting shed.
</P>
<P>
   But Snowbasin has more to offer recreational skiers than most
have ever discovered. When the new Olympic road is completed to the
Ogden area, it will be even easier to reach. But for a trek to new
territory, Snowbasin is a find.
</P>
<P>
   Better known _ in fact the standbys of Utah skiing _ Snowbird
(800-385-2002) and Alta (801-359-1078) are the two areas that first
brought in the planes.
</P>
<P>
   Just half an hour from Salt Lake City lies Snowbird, an area
that averages a whopping 500 inches of snow yearly. That means on
any given day, skiers headed up to Snowbird will probably have some
fresh powder to ski in. For Easterners, this is the place to rent a
pair of fatties, and get a lesson in the champagne powder. Skiing
with no bottom under foot is a whole new feel, an exhilarating one
at that.
</P>
<P>
   Located in Little Cottonwood Canyon, Snowbird also has a
world-class spa and the famous Cliff Lodge at its base. Putting on
boots here, looking out at Mount Baldy is only the first moment at
Snowbird where you suck in your breath. Your first ride up the
100-passenger tram is the second. And it only gets better from
there.
</P>
<P>
   Alta was one of the earliest Utah areas. Built in the '30s, and
loved by ages of powder hounds, Alta has the reputation for steep
cornices and bowls, hidden veins of powder always to be mined over
some newly discovered ridge.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Alta does have some really fine novice terrain. What it has
less of are those groomed intermediate runs that many Easterners
seem to like. So, come to Alta to change your approach. Go for some
untracked powder and open bowl sking. Many worldwide skiers still
count Alta, with its 2,200 acres, its moderately-priced lift
tickets, and its no-snowboard policy, as their number one place to
ski.
</P>
<P>
   Park City (800-453-1360) is the heart of the US Alpine ski
world, home and headquarters of our national ski team, and site of
the kickoff of the World Cup season each Thanksgiving time. Little
wonder that this 3,300-acre area has really kicked it up a notch in
preparation for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   What other mountain anywhere has four high-speed six packs
running up its steeps all day? And a 750-acre high adventure area
for skiers and boarders seeking some difference in the pace of
their sport. Park City offers as thorough a mix of skiing tastes as
you can find at one area, and is the most accommodating site in
Utah. But this is hardly the area to come for skiers in a
getting-away-from-it-all mood. This is the buzzing hub of the ski
world.
</P>
<P>
   Its first innovation many years ago was to greet skiers with ski
valets, and pamper them from arrival to departure. Now, a decade
old, Deer Valley Resort (800-424-3337) is still known as one of the
plushest, service-oriented resorts in ski country. This works for
some, not for others.
</P>
<P>
   Deer Valley works best for skiers who like predictability,
beauty, groomed snow, and some of the best cruising runs in the
Rockies. Apres ski life is both an epicurean and bacchanalian
delight.
</P>
<P>
   But Deer Valley is trying hard not to stagnate as the resort for
old softies, and has started coming with some tough, off-trail
skiing, as well as some hard rock down in the village at night. In
2002, Deer Valley will be home to the very youth-oriented Freestyle
events, and it's working on the transition already. A welcome one
at that.

BE A SMART PARKGOER: KEEP TO YOUR LEFT

   So much is happening so quickly in the Land of Theme Parks _ the
Orlando, Fla., area _ that Fodor's Travel Publications now updates
its ``Walt Disney World, Universal Studios, and Orlando'' guide
twice a year. Here are tips from Fodor's on easing the theme park
hassle:
</P>
<P>
   --When entering the parks, walk to the left. Everyone naturally
goes to the right, so you'll move much faster on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   --Measure your children's heights before leaving home. You don't
want them getting too excited over a ride that they're not tall
enough to be allowed on.
</P>
<P>
   --Bring your own drinks if the parks allow it. If possible,
freeze them the night before so they'll stay cold all day.
</P>
<P>
   --Consider leaving the parks in the afternoon and going to a
water park or your hotel pool, thus keeping cool while escaping the
afternoon crush.
</P>
<P>
   --Bring a change of socks daily. They'll make your youngsters'
feet (and yours, too) feel rested and put a little more oomph in
everyone's step.
</P>
<P>
   --If you're traveling with small children, add an extra day or
two _ and go on the tamest rides first. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Travel Trivia: What is the official mammal of Florida? &QL; 
 &QL; 
In a name: The Bird Emergency Aid and Kare Sanctuary on Big Talbot
Island, near Jacksonville, Fla., is also known by its acronym:
BEAKS. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quotable: ``We have a new tourism slogan: `Come Back to Miami _ We
Weren't Shooting at You' '' _ Dave Barry (who, for once, was making
that up). &QL; 
 &QL; 
Bus driver joke (on the drive from sunny Orlando to the Disney
Cruise Line Terminal in sunny Port Canaveral, Fla.): ``The ride
should take about an hour. If we encounter snow and ice, it'll take
a little longer.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Today's loopy law: Florida forbids singing in a public place while
attired in a swimsuit. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Event to remember: Next Saturday, St. Augustine, Fla., turns on the
lights _ more than a million tiny ones that outline the houses and
buildings of the historic downtown area. The ``Night of Lights''
inaugurates a holiday celebration that will run through Jan. 30. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Sign of the times: A sign in the Outback Steak House in Orlando
(and presumably other Outback locations), points toward the ``Used
Beer Dept.'' Writes Mary Powers of Gloucester: ``I laughed when I
realized it was pointing to the restrooms!'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Museum of the month: Everybody say, ``Vroom!'' The Don Garlits
Museum of Drag Racing, near Ocala, Fla., is hot-rod heaven, with
dragsters from over the years, including the record-breaking
``swamp rats'' that were driven by Big Daddy Garlits himself. There
is a variety of other vehicles, including ``muscle cars,'' and
Garlits's fellow racers are saluted. For more information, call
352-245-8661. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Alaskan pelican sighted: Outdoor sculptures for two state office
buildings in Florida and Alaska were done by the same sculptor _
eagles for Alaska and pelicans for Florida. But they were delivered
to the wrong places. Deciding this was a wonderful mistake, the
buildings kept the misdirected sculptures, leaving the pelicans on
display in Alaska and the eagles in Florida. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Snappy slogan: You've heard of ``carpe diem'' (``seize the day'').
Well, the Downtown Disney entertainment complex in Lake Buena
Vista, Fla., advises ``carpe p.m.'' (``seize the night''). &QL; 
 &QL; 
Did you guess it? The panther, one of the world's most endangered
animals.

THANKSGIVING, WHERE IT ALL BEGAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   If you haven't made plans for Thanksgiving, why not celebrate it
where it all began?
</P>
<P>
   In Plymouth, ``America's Hometown,'' visitors can not only walk
where the Pilgrims did, but feast on a traditional Thanksgiving
meal at Plimoth Plantation, a re-creation of the Pilgrims' village,
or in area restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   While Plymouth is just an hour from Boston, and can easily be
seen in a day trip, it's also well worth staying overnight to fully
appreciate all that can be seen. A visit to Plimoth Plantation can
easily take most of the day, particularly if you take time to chat
with the Pilgrims, costumed reenactors who will gladly talk about
anything as long as it is not later than the village's time of
162730.
</P>
<P>
   There's also Plymouth Rock; the Mayflower II, a replica of the
Pilgrim's original vessel; open houses at the Jabez Howland House,
the only home in Plymouth where Pilgrims actually lived; the
Richard Sparrow House, the oldest in Plymouth; Harlow Old Fort
House, built out of timbers from the Pilgrims' original fort; the
Pilgrim Hall Museum, with 17th-century artifacts of the original
colonists, and on Nov. 20 the Majestic Thanksgiving Parade.
</P>
<P>
   Along the waterfront, visit also the Ocean Spray Cranberry
Museum, where you can learn everything you ever wanted to know
about this traditional part of the Thanksgiving meal. Nearby in
South Carver is Edaville Railroad, a narrow gauge train that
travels on five miles of tracks alongside cranberry bogs.
</P>
<P>
   If you stay over, take in a Colonial Lantern Tour (508-747-4161)
where you can walk through history.
</P>
<P>
   On Thanksgiving day, Plimoth Plantation offers two meal choices:
a Victorian Dinner (three seatings), which celebrates 1863, when
Abraham Lincoln declared Thanksgiving an official holiday; and a
Thanksgiving Day Buffet. For information on these meals, call (508)
746-1622 or log on to www.plimoth.org.
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty of lodging, including the John Carver Inn, which
has a wonderful indoor Pilgrim-themed swimming pool that the kids
will love (508-746-7100 or 800-274-1620). The inn has a two-night
package at $299 for two that includes breakfasts, a dinner
allowance, and admission to Plimoth Plantation. Other choices
include the Sheraton Inn (508-747-4900), which has a $94 a night
double occupancy rate through Nov. 22; and the Governor Bradford on
the Harbour (800-332-1620), which offers an ocean view room at $80
a person.

NOW IT'S GRAND IN WINTER, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To gaze at the Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods, N.H., is
to understand the term ``grand hotel.'' The massive red-and-white
Spanish Renaissance building, with its 900-foot veranda and the
Presidential Range as a backdrop, has been nicknamed the Queen of
Mountain Resorts. And now it's a snow queen, too.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Nov. 24, the hotel, a stately summer destination since
1902, will be open four seasons. The conversion of this National
Historic Landmark to a winter-ready establishment took some doing .
. . and $2 million. More than 800 windows were replaced with
double-pane insulated glass. Thermostats were installed in the 200
guest rooms and suites, a backup boiler system was built, a backup
generator was added, and the hotel's water treatment systems were
winterized. As part of the preparation, thermometers were hung from
corridor ceilings to make sure the passageways were warm. And to
test the accommodations, general manager Anthony Ferrelli and his
wife lived in the hotel all last winter, and department heads were
invited to spend a night.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Bretton Woods Ski Area was purchased by the hotel,
so there are a variety of ski-and-stay hotel packages. This winter
West Mountain opens adjacent to the Bretton Woods Ski Area, with
snowmaking, new trails, and lifts. Bretton Woods says this gives
the area the most ski terrain in New Hampshire. And the Bretton
Woods Cross Country Ski Resort is right on the hotel grounds.
</P>
<P>
   So there should be plenty to do, both on the slopes and in the
hotel, with its restaurants, banquet rooms, and Cave Lounge, which
features live evening entertainment. Actually, just walking around
this famous hotel is entertainment of a sort. One thing, though:
Looking down the long, long corridors, you may be reminded of the
hotel in that spooky movie ``The Shining'' and assume, as many do,
that it was filmed at the Mount Washington. You're not even close _
the Stephen King book was inspired by the Stanley Hotel in Estes
Park, Colo., but for technical reasons exterior shots were filmed
at at the Timberline Lodge on Mount Hood, Ore., and interior sets
were built in England.
</P>
<P>
   (The Mount Washington Hotel will be open late November to early
April, then mid-May to mid-October. Several special events are
planned this winter, including an opening gala Nov. 24-28 and a
winter carnival Jan. 7-20. For more information, call 800-258-0330
or visit www.mtwashington.com.) &QL;

clear day, all of Lake Geneva. Leysin is also home to a challenging
new half-pipe and the World Masters Snowboard series. &QL;

DEATH-PENALTY FIGHT PULLS HISTORIAN INTO THE PRESENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ART ADV.: A photo is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers
can make individual purchases by calling 212-556-4204 or -1927.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ William S. McFeely's ``Proximity to Death''
begins with a journey from Athens to Sparta. Though it's modern-day
Georgia the Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer of Ulysses S. Grant
and Frederick Douglass is traveling in, the echo of ancient Greece
is intentional. For the subject of McFeely's book is an issue as
old as Socrates or Antigone: the morality of the state taking a
life in the pursuit of justice.
</P>
<P>
   McFeely is one of America's most distinguished historians of the
Reconstruction era. Four years ago, he found himself transported
from past to present when a lawyer representing an inmate on death
row called to see if he would be willing to testify as an expert at
a hearing. McFeely said yes, and ``Proximity to Death'' _ a book
about the death penalty and a band of Atlanta lawyers opposed to it
_ is the result.
</P>
<P>
   It makes considerable sense that McFeely, 69, should turn to
capital punishment as a subject. ``One way or another,'' he says,
``I've been teaching about race all along,'' and the US justice
system is at its most black and white _ in both senses of the term
_ where the death penalty is concerned. As of April 1, 43 percent
of death row inmates were black (a number more than three times the
percentage of blacks in the overall population), and 84 percent of
the victims in death row cases were white _ though only 50 percent
of murder victims were.
</P>
<P>
   McFeely's involvement with race extends all the way to his
kindergarten days in suburban New Jersey. He recalls how the site
of a class picnic had to be changed because one of his classmates
was black. It ended up at McFeely's house.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter century later, when McFeely was at graduate school at
Yale, the civil rights movement was cresting. That, combined with
the presence of C. Vann Woodward, the dean of Southern historians,
helped determine McFeely's destiny. He signed up for Woodward's
seminar on Reconstruction and, he says, ``I was hooked.''
</P>
<P>
   McFeely's raspy voice is well suited to his bulldog face and
energetic manner _ neither of which seems especially professorial,
though. This is as it should be, perhaps, since he took a somewhat
roundabout path to scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Amherst College, he took a job with
National City Bank (now Citigroup) in New York. ``I wasn't all that
much of a banker,'' McFeely says, ``but when I used to travel for
the bank _ my district was West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey
_ my job was really to call on the little country banks and small
companies. I'd be in a little town like Pottsville or something,
and what do you do in the evening? I'd find myself walking the
streets of the town and getting a sense of it. I have got, I think,
the kind of curiosity that makes me able to connect the formal
historical past with how people relate to it in the present.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine years as a banker made McFeely realize high finance wasn't
for him. He had vague thoughts of becoming a secondary school
teacher when an Amherst faculty member told him to call on the
chairman of the American Studies program at Yale. This was in
August, and classes were about to begin, so the chairman fobbed off
McFeely on the dean _ who let him in on probation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was too naive to know it was impossible to do what I wanted
to do,'' McFeely says. ``It was incredibly scary, looking back. I
had a wife, no money, kids, and no assurance I'd make it.''
</P>
<P>
   McFeely and his wife have been married 47 years. Herself a
historian, Mary Drake McFeely is finishing a book for the
University of Massachusetts Press called ``Can She Bake a Cherry
Pie?,'' a study of women and cooking in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   The McFeelys, who divide their time between Wellfleet and
Cambridge, have a son and daughter. The son, Drake, is president of
W. W. Norton, which makes him his father's publisher. ``Drake and I
work very hard to stay out of each other's way there,'' McFeely
laughs. ``I was there first,'' he's quick to add.
</P>
<P>
   After earning a PhD with a dissertation on O. O. Howard, the
Union general who headed the Freedmen's Bureau after the Civil War,
McFeely taught at Yale before moving on to Mount Holyoke College to
become dean of faculty and professor of history. He stayed there 16
years, until wooed away by the University of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Culturally, the Pioneer Valley is about as far as you can get
from the Deep South and still hear American English being spoken.
Of course, there are those who would argue that Athens, the site of
the university, while it may be in the South, is barely of it. It's
home not just to the Georgia Bulldogs, pride of the Southeastern
Conference, but also the rock groups REM and the B-52s. It says
something about both McFeely and the homeyness of Athens that
during his 11 years in Georgia he became both an REM fan (``The
band is really something'') and friendly with its members.
</P>
<P>
   McFeely retired two years ago. ``I do miss teaching,'' he says,
``but I'm also enjoying the luxury of just concentrating on
writing.''
</P>
<P>
   In both the new book and its immediate predecessor, ``Sapelo's
People'' (1994), a quite amiable examination of the past and
present inhabitants of one of the Sea Islands off Georgia, one can
see a writer enjoying the opportunity to take chances and use
different literary muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did switch gears,'' McFeely says. ``I do think people can
hear my voice in my biographies of Grant and Douglass, but they're
both 19th-century figures, long dead, and I took a standard,
scholarly, third-person approach. But, somehow, writing in the
first person feels comfortable to me . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun writing about the present. I don't think of myself
as a journalist, but I can understand the fascination of talking to
people who are different from you and getting to know them.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of those people McFeely came to know are convicted
murderers sitting on death row. He remains in correspondence with
them and clearly takes their plight to heart. What had been a vague
and somewhat abstract opposition to capital punishment has become,
in the four years since his appearance before that sentencing
hearing, distressingly specific and concrete.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a violent culture,'' McFeely says, ``and I have a theory
that the death penalty is the capstone of this whole sense of
violence . . . its ultimate expression.'' The passion of his
opposition has not blinded McFeely to how widespread the support
for capital punishment is in this country, but he draws on his
scholarly background for an encouraging analogy. ``The
Abolitionists must have thought theirs was a hopeless cause, but
eventually they prevailed.''
</P>
<P>
   He shrugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope (with this book) I've opened up the discourse a little
bit.''

   Here's how it starts: ``Sexx Laws'' shimmies from the speakers
like some sort of ``Hullabaloo''-style go-go revue _ all funked-up
horns, reverberating synths, boogaloo bass, jittery tambourine.
``Can't you hear those cavalry drums/Hijacking your

doctors moan,'' Beck drawls, moving on in short order to the
cokeheads, concubines, coquettes, handcuffs, and brief encounters
in expensive cars. An unnerving old-time banjo break momentarily
derails the dank pageantry. You can practically see the singer
shuck 'n' jive. On ``Midnight Vultures'' (DGC), out Nov. 16,
29-year-old Beck continues to fulfill his destiny as post-modern
geek-pimp for the surreal, curator of the slash-and-burn art of
ironic overkill, and purveyor of a brilliant, musical merging of
satire and critique.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually gone is the freaky folk-hop of 1996's ground-breaking
``Odelay''; so are the warped psychedelic noodlings that fueled
last year's ``Mutations.'' But junk culture is still his landscape,
and fractured dance music his main architectural statement. This
time around Beck finds his muse in the tacky glamour of late-'90s
Los Angeles. His musical persona is a twisted tormentor of a soul
man, brought into vivid relief by a core band of keyboards and
bass, plus a pair of computer programmers and guests who include
ex-Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr, techno-folkie Beth Orton, and
``Odelay'' producers the Dust Brothers. ``I'll feed you fruit that
don't exist/I'll leave grafitti where you've never been kissed,''
Beck sings on ``Nicotine and Gravy,'' lounging in a sonic waterbed
of sighs and cackles, percolating bass lines, and a spry, sing-song
loop imploring ``I don't want to die tonight.'' The sun seems to be
setting _ fast _ behind Beck's famously mixed metaphors.
</P>
<P>
   Song titles say a lot about the album's general state of mind.
``Hlwd. Freaks.'' ``Mixed Bizness.'' ``Peaches and Cream.'' ``Get
Real Paid.'' The latter is a space-age club tome to contemporary
society where the robotic voices drone ``we like the guys with the
bulletproof vests/we like the girls with the cellophane chests.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Debra'' is a longtime concert staple that sounds for all the
world like a laid-back R&AMP;B love ballad, replete with dazzling
falsetto vocals, but the sweet tune quickly reveals itself as a
tale of seductive lechery: ``I want to get with you/Only you/And
your sister/I think her name's Debra.''
</P>
<P>
   Twisted collage is the thing, and while the album's emphasis is
on R&AMP;B, Beck manages to channel arena rock (power chords the
consistency of shredded plutonium) and the Beatles (ooh-la-la-la
harmony vocals from ``Nowhere Man'') in one fell swoop on
``Pressure Zone.'' Unfortunately, ``Milk and Honey'' is just bad
arena rock, albeit made slightly more palatable with sampled
sounds, taped voices, and implicit irony. He introduces electronica
to the bossa nova via shades of aural paisley on ``Broken Train,''
to better, and ultra-groovy, effect.
</P>
<P>
   Beck has called ``Midnight Vultures'' his ``dumb party record.''
Which shows just how intact his sense of irony is. In the land of
cell phones and laser surgery, at a time when teen bands and
boneheads vie for pop music's crown, Beck's music is a breath of
modern-rock air: smart, risky, witty, and relevant. You can also
spaz out to it on the dance floor. Who could ask for anything more?

MIAMI BEACH ART DECO DISTRICT NOW STYLISH INTERNATIONAL GETAWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM A. DAVIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI BEACH _ There is nowhere else in America quite like the
South Beach section here. Never has been, really.
</P>
<P>
   Some of us can recall the time when what is now trendily known
as SoBe, which for a period between the world wars was a
fashionable winter haven for celebrities and the well-to-do, had
fallen on hard times. A neighborhood of deteriorating old hotels
occupied largely by elderly retired garment workers from New York,
it was derisively known as ``God's Waiting Room.'' Wholesale
demolition seemed an eventual certainty.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a few visionary and determined preservationists,
recognizing that South Beach contained the country's largest
concentration of buildings in the Art Deco style _ an international
design style that peaked in popularity in America in the 1930s and
1940s _ came to the rescue. Organized as the Miami Design
Preservation League, they restored many buildings and saved others
from the wrecker's ball. They also gave the neighborhood its own
distinctive color scheme, replacing the original shades of white on
most buildings with a rainbow of pastel colors inspired by Necco
candy wafers.
</P>
<P>
   By 1979 some 900 buildings in the area were placed on the
National Register of Historic Places, and the federal government
created an Art Deco Historic District, the first for the purpose of
preserving 20th-century architecture. The league has an office at
1001 Washington Ave. and distributes maps pinpointing the Art Deco
landmarks. It also conducts walking tours of the district during
which affable and enthusiastic guides point out both the league's
triumphs (beautifully restored buildings) and its failures (parking
lots where Art Deco gems once stood).
</P>
<P>
   Historic it may be, but the Art Deco District also makes almost
any list of hippest places in America. Most of the action is in the
10 blocks along Ocean Avenue from Fifth to 14th streets: an almost
unbroken lineup of Art Deco buildings (the majority small
bed-and-breakfast hotels) facing the ocean and Miami Beach's best
beach.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first part of the district to be restored and
gentrified and remains the most atmospheric. Also, definitely the
most photographed.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion photographers were quick to appreciate the district's
visual charms, using its sun-drenched streets, palm-tree-lined
beachfront, and colorful buildings as backgrounds for fashion
layouts in the world's top magazines. Many episodes of ``Miami
Vice,'' a popular TV show in the mid-1980s, were also filmed in
SoBe, spotlighting its charms (while exaggerating its dangers) for
viewers in some 135 countries. This exposure on TV and in glossy
high-fashion magazines, probably more than anything else, made the
Art Deco District the trendy international destination it has
become.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago the lobby area of many classic Ocean Avenue Art
Deco hotels such as the Avalon, Cardozo, Clevelander, Waldorf
Towers, and Edison housed the offices of modeling agencies or were
assembly points for fashion shoots. These days, most businesses
related to the booming fashion industry are found several blocks
inland on Lincoln Road, the upscale eight- block-long pedestrian
shopping and dining mall that claims to be ``The Fifth Avenue of
the South.''
</P>
<P>
   Today the lobbies and adjacent verandas where impossibly
good-looking male and female models used to congregate at first
light (the fashion photographer's favorite time of day) are likely
to be occupied by restaurants or cafes, and the avenue is more or
less one sidewalk eatery and drinkery after another. The lobby and
patio of the Avalon Hotel, for instance, are taken up by one of
SoBe's best seafood restaurants, A Fish Called Avalon. (To heighten
the Art Deco atmosphere, Avalon's owner usually parks his vintage
1950s' canary yellow Oldsmobile convertible right in front of the
restaurant.)
</P>
<P>
   At the epicenter of this lively strip _ and arguably its best
people-watching perch _ is the News Cafe. Although it has an indoor
area and a shop that sells sundries, books, and newspapers and
magazines from around the world, the News is essentially an outdoor
cafe and conversation pit. It's open 24 hours a day, and the buzz
of talk in most of the world's major languages rises and falls
around the clock but never stops.
</P>
<P>
   Because so many of its customers are Europeans accustomed to
having a service charge automatically included in their bar and
restaurant tabs, the cafe _ like many other SoBe establishments _
calculates a 15 percent ``suggested tip'' and puts it on the check.
</P>
<P>
   Every few years or so the Art Deco District seems to shed a skin
and become something a bit different. It also changes, sometimes
quite dramatically, throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   In early morning, crews from fashion magazines and advertising
agencies are nearly as much in evidence as joggers and dog walkers.
The sight of beautiful female models wrapped provocatively around
palm trees or tossing beach balls at each other with
near-hysterical glee is commonplace along Ocean Avenue, at least
around 6 a.m. or so.
</P>
<P>
   During the day the wide beach, which periodically has to be
shored up and resanded by the Army Corps of Engineers, fills up
with people. By midafternoon it's usually a colorful human mosaic
of swimmers, tanners, exercisers, and gawking tourists.
</P>
<P>
   In the evening the oceanfront cafe and restaurants get busy,
their kitchens scenting the humid air with delicious aromas while
competing sound systems fill it with pounding, nonstop salsa
rhythms. After midnight, the crowd gets younger and the scene tends
to shift to inland discos and clubs. However, during SoBe's
equivalent of Mardi Gras, the mid-January ``Art Deco Weekend''
organized by the Design Preservation League, the mid-section of
Ocean Avenue is closed to traffic and given over to street dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean Avenue is the Art Deco District's undisputed showcase.
However, there's also a lot to see and do nearby. Parallel Collins
Avenue, for instance, is dotted with upscale shops and boutique
hotels like the Marlin, Raleigh, and Delano, which have been
tastefully (and expensively) restored and attract celebrity guests.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Collins is a beloved SoBe institution, Puerto Sagua, a
pleasant but unpretentious restaurant at 700 Collins renowned for
massive portions of flavorful Cuban food. A typical luncheon
special _ such as fricasseed chicken served with plantains, yams,
and a small mountain of rice _ if completely consumed (not easy)
provides enough calories to keep an average person going until
lunch the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Avenue, a block in from Collins, has retained a funky
old-time South Beach feeling. There are a few upmarket shops but
many more family-run markets and fruit stands. The avenue also
boasts one of the district's few non-Art Deco architectural
landmarks: the impressively domed Miami Beach Post Office.
Acoustics beneath the great dome are so good concerts are sometimes
held there.
</P>
<P>
   Another Washington Avenue landmark is the Wolfsonian Foundation
building, an imposing Spanish baroque structure that looks as if it
was teleported from Seville. Actually, it was a storage warehouse
built in 1927 in the then fashionable Mediterranean Revival style
and converted into a design museum in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   A fascinating place, the Wolfsonian displays carefully selected
items from local multimillionaire Mickey Wolfson's collection of
more than 70,000 varied objects, including books and paper,
furniture, bric-a-brac, sculpture, paintings, and architectural
models. All represent some aspect of the cultural, political, and
technological changes that swept the globe in the century before
World War II. It's a wildly eclectic collection that incudes items
as disparate as a bentwood rocker manufactured in Gardner, Mass.,
at the turn of the century and a beautifully bound Braille edition
of ``Mein Kampf!''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to polyglot Ocean Avenue, American English and
Cuban-accented Spanish are the languages most frequently heard
along Washington Avenue. An exception is the corner of Washington
and Espanola Way, where you're likely to hear anything from Arabic
to Zulu.
</P>
<P>
   That's because this is the site of the Clay Hotel and
International Hostel, which draws its mostly youthful and
backpack-carrying guests from around the world. Built in the '20s,
The Clay was once one of Miami Beach's most fashionable hotels. It
was in its ballroom that legendary Cuban bandleader Desi Arnaz
introduced the rhumba to America. (He later became even more famous
as the husband of Lucille Ball of ``I Love Lucy'' fame.)
</P>
<P>
   Not your usual hostel, the Clay has private rooms with baths as
well as bunk-filled dormitories. An unusual amenity for an American
hostel is the Clay's sidewalk cafe on Espanola Way, which is itself
rather unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Only a block long, Espanola Way was designed as an artists'
quarter and is intentionally picturesque, paved with cobblestones
and its Mediterranean-style buildings ornamented with tiles,
brightly colored awnings, and elaborate wrought-iron balconies.
Most of the buildings have art galleries, boutiques, and craft
shops at street level with artists' studios in the upper floors.
</P>
<P>
   Many ``Miami Vice'' episodes were filmed on Espanola, which on
the television screen often echoed to the sounds of gunshots. In
real life, however, the loudest sound you're apt to hear is a
cheerful German or Aussie backpacker calling for another beer or
cafe cubano.

BARRY LEVINSON GOES HOME WITH `LIBERTY HEIGHTS' 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
Our rating:   3 stars 
(Eds: Fact box at bottom)  
By  GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; Lovingly crafted and quaint almost to the point of irrelevance,
``Liberty Heights'' marks filmmaker Barry Levinson's return to his
old Baltimore stomping grounds, and the results should please
anyone who enjoyed ``Diner'' or ``Avalon.'' The film possesses the
same full-bodied characterizations and detailed observations that
have defined Levinson's best work, even if their impact here is
more appreciated than felt.
</P>
<P>
   At its best, ``Liberty Heights'' means to overturn cliched and
bigoted assumptions made about various ethnic groups in the film's
eponymous setting. The story takes place in northwest Baltimore's
Liberty Heights neighborhood in 1954, a year Levinson signals
denotes as a cultural crossroads. Schools are being desegregated ,
and the automobile is more readily available, giving young people
greater mobility to move between the city's invisible neighborhood
lines.
</P>
<P>
   That's significant, for as the voice-over narrator states early
on, he thought the ``whole world was Jewish'' when he was a child.
This is the voice of Ben (Ben Foster, a regular on NBC's new drama
``Freaks and Geeks''), the youngest of the two sons of benign
mobster Nate Kurtzman (Joe Mantegna). Nate runs a failing burlesque
house, which is really just a front for his failing numbers racket.
He's looking for new ways to make a buck.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the film's three intertwining story lines. The
other two deal with Nate's sons, Ben and the first-born Van (Adrien
Brody). Ben has fallen for a classmate, Sylvia (Groundlings alum
Rebekah Johnson), the first African-American student in his class.
Sylvia introduces Ben to the hidden sounds of rock 'n' roll via
James Brown, Ray Charles and Big Joe Turner. But the two must keep
their burgeoning friendship a secret, because neither family would
approve.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Van, a true romantic, falls hard for the beautiful
blond-haired, blue-eyed princess Dubbie (model Carolyn Murphy)
after crashing a WASP party. Van's entry into this upper-class
enclave isn't without incident: One of his friends instigates a
fight after a perceived slur, and later they all witness an
automobile accident involving a tortured James Dean character named
Trey (Justin Chambers). Much of this borders on melodrama, and the
whole film has a kind of ``Wonder Years'' self-involvement that
those outside the boomer generation will find somewhat tedious.
After all, do we really need another nostalgic recitation of why
all things significant began in the 1950s?
</P>
<P>
   That said, Levinson has filled ``Liberty Heights'' with enough
sweet humor and heartfelt emotion to make it enjoyable. The winning
ensemble of actors has a lot to do with the film's success. Brody,
so good in Spike Lee's ``Summer of Sam,'' has magnetism to spare,
and newcomer Foster is memorable as the clever younger brother.
Murphy and Chambers, who both got their start modeling, show much
promise as well.
</P>
<P>
   If Levinson's observations concerning American mores have a
familiarity that borders on redundancy, they do come with enough
nuance and sincerity to make them palatable. ``Liberty Heights''
doesn't feel like uncharted territory, but it's a nice enough place
to spend a couple of hours. &QL;

THE COMPASSION GAP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; _ Conservatism in Texas desperately needs the
veneer of compassion, which is supplied by the ideologically nimble
George W. Bush as if he were seeking absolution, not solutions.
</P>
<P>
   There is, after all, so much to be compassionate about in the
vast policy wasteland of Texas. And from a governor whose leading
guru has a strange explanation for the societal ills that affect
Texas almost more than any other state: the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Myron Magnet's assignment of blame is not to the '60s as
experienced by the president-in-waiting _ a boozy, frat house
mediocrity that afflicted him well into the 1980s. No, it was the
``liberal'' 1960s, whose cultural and political causes deprived the
poor of their initiative and led them to fail to take advantage of
the limitless opportunities set before them years later by Ronald
Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, really.
</P>
<P>
   Magnet, one of the mainstays of the New York-based Manhattan
Institute, has been supplying Bush with conceptual drivel since the
year before Bush ran for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Another think tank has had special meaning for Bush, the
Dallas-based National Center for Policy Alternatives. Its
president, John Goodman, is also a health-care adviser to the GOP
front-runner, and was a key appointee to a Texas commission
examining a problem Texas faces like no other state _ one in four
residents has no insurance. Ideally, Goodman would privatize both
Social Security and Medicare and substitute the magic of tax
credits, as well as jettison such enemies of the work ethic as
unemployment insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Compassionate conservatism confronts an immense landscape in
Texas, which shares with other state laboratories of the true faith
an aversion to local effort where the poor, social services, and
the public health are concerned, in favor of a reliance on the
federal government for what few policy crumbs their residents
manage to get.
</P>
<P>
   Consider what requires compassion, a partial snapshot courtesy
of that most relentless of Web sites, Bushwatch.com:
</P>
<P>
   Since Bush became governor in 1995, Texas has consistently been
first in its vast population of the uninsured. It is sometimes
first, sometimes second in uninsured kids, but consistently first
among women.
</P>
<P>
   It is also first in measured releases of toxic junk into the
air, and Houston leads in the country in its annual number of
smog-alert days.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is third in the incidence of hunger and fifth in its birth
rate for kids born to teenage parents.
</P>
<P>
   Moving toward the bottom of the barrel, Texas is 45th in women's
prenatal care. It is 46th in state effort for public libraries and
protection of water resources, as well as high school completion
rates. Texas is 47th in the delivery of social services. And it is
48th in its public health expenditures per capita, as well as its
effort on parks and recreation, and the arts. It was rated the 48th
best state in which to raise children.
</P>
<P>
   The good governor's ``self-policing'' attitude toward polluters
helps account for Texas's ranking of 49th in state effort on
environmental protection. And the state brings up the rear in its
teacher salaries and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Never one to rest on laurels, Governor Bush has in the last
couple of years been a pioneer in the abuse of welfare ``reform''
to reduce health care for children even more. The replacement of an
income maintenance entitlement with work was not supposed to affect
families' eligibility for Medicaid; but it has.
</P>
<P>
   And a new, bipartisanly supported effort to supplement Medicaid
with a federal-state program to insure kids was not supposed to be
used as a cover for Medicaid-slashing, but it has been.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Texas leads.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of 12 major states by Families USA, Bush's Texas was
by far the leader in producing since 1996 a net decline in the
number of kids covered under Medicaid and the new children's
insurance program, compared to those covered undered Medicaid alone
before. The decline was a whopping 14.2 percent, and the numerical
drop in kids' coverage (193,400) exceeded California's by more than
50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman's policy wonkery will presumably help Bush cure both
Texas's and the country's health care problems. In the meantime,
like his protege, he opposes any expansion of national efforts to
help working families afford health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   This, Myron Magnet would argue, is the essence of compassion. In
his 1993 tome ``The Dream and the Nightmare: The Sixties Legacy to
the Underclass,'' Magnet explains that counter-culture
permissiveness and the War on Poverty persuaded the poor, and
especially young, black males to prefer indolence to effort. Magnet
did not explain why this persuasion was so much more successful in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In his preoccupation with black people as the core of the
underclass, Magent is also less helpful in dealing with the
country's expanding Hispanic population, which comprises half of
Texas's nation-leading uninsured ranks. How the counter-culture
destroyed the initiative of Hispanics may be a fertile field for
conservative intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the compassion proclaimed to be so widespread
in George W. Bush's Texas may look to the rest of us like official
indifference and cruelty.

 HOUSTON: x x x market it as fiction.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The California-based Villasenor gave back his $75,000 advance
and took his manuscript to Arte Publico, which published ``Rain of
Gold'' in 1991 as its first hardcover. The book remains in print in
hardcover from Arte Publico and in paperback from Bantam.
</P>
<P>
   ```The Rain of Gold' experience was crucial for us, because it
taught us how to publish a hardcover release and really slug it out
with the big boys,'' Kanellos says.
</P>
<P>
   The book was a regional best seller, but the press encountered
resistance when trying to sell nationwide. Some parts of the
country simply weren't receptive to Latino literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``One wholesaler didn't take `Rain of Gold' because the cover
was, quote, too ethnic, unquote,'' Kanellos says. The lucrative
Northeast market in particular is tough to crack for Hispanic
writers, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Of the manuscripts Arte Publico publishes, about 30 percent to
40 percent are submitted by literary agents. But Arte Publico is
``one of the few presses that still opens the mail,'' Kanellos
says, which means its editors actually look at unsolicited
material. He estimates that another 30 percent to 40 percent of
Arte Publico titles come ``over the transom,'' in the phrase of the
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Graciela Limon's ``In Search of Bernabe'' (1993), winner of an
American Book Award, is one over-the-transom title that has done
well. Last spring Limon published ``The Day of the Moon,'' her
fourth book with Arte Publico.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder come from authors who have become part of the Arte
Publico ``stable.'' Poet Pat Mora, children's author Judith Ortiz
Cofer and novelist Nicholasa Mohr are among that number.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether the press gets more than 2,000 submissions each year
for its 30 to 35 publishing slots, Kanellos says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We invest in (new authors), which is hard. The hardest part of
publishing fiction is launching that first book, when nobody knows
the author.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite often that first book goes down the drain and you don't
sell anything. So when we do this we have to be thinking about the
second book, and that works out quite often.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the best-known authors who have published with Arte
Publico are poet Sandra Cisneros and novelists Ana Castillo and
Julia Alvarez.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds to three-fourths of Arte Publico books are by
Mexican-American authors. But the press is stretching into
Cuban-American literature simply because so many new young writers,
like Florida's Virgil Suarez, are producing good material.
</P>
<P>
   And the press has embarked on a project to reprint all the
fiction of Jose Yglesias, an important Cuban-American writer who
died in 1995 and who wrote more than a dozen books of fiction and
nonfiction beginning in the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   A relatively small number of titles by Puerto Rican writers
fills out the catalog.
</P>
<P>
   The press has 16 full-time and more than 20 part-time staff
members.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues from books total more than $1 million a year. The press
also receives grant support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to break even every year as a nonprofit
(organization),'' Kanellos says. ``Most years we break even and
bank a little bit. A couple years we ran a deficit.''
</P>
<P>
   Arte Publico aggressively advertises itself as ``the oldest and
largest publisher of U.S. Hispanic literature.'' Kanellos says only
two other publishers in the country share the same mission_
Bilingual Press at Arizona State University in Tempe and a Cuban
exile publisher in Miami, Ediciones Universal, which publishes only
in Spanish. (The Pittsburgh-based journal Latin American Literary
Review publishes six or seven titles a year in translation.) Among
the press' most important activities is the Recovering the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic Literary Heritage Project.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning of his career, Kanellos realized that
American Hispanics had produced a vast amount of literature over
the centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, much of it was, if not lost, at least
unavailable, sitting uncataloged in archives or squirreled away in
people's attics.
</P>
<P>
   Americo Paredes, the great folklorist with whom Kanellos studied
as a doctoral student at the University of Texas, pointed out the
importance of Spanish-language newspapers, which published stories,
essays and poetry as well as traditional journalism. Paredes
himself first published poetry in San Antonio and Brownsville
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody should try to find those old papers, Paredes said.
</P>
<P>
   But it really wasn't until the mid-1980s that the cohort of
scholars specializing in Latino culture was large enough and had
enough clout in academia to launch a major research project to
recover lost Hispanic literature. By the early 1990s the advent of
the Internet made researching this material much easier.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, funding from the Rockefeller Foundation helped launch
Recovering the U.S. Hispanic Literary Heritage Project. Its goal:
``to locate, identify, preserve and make accessible the literary
contributions of U.S. Hispanics from colonial times through 1960 in
what today comprises the 50 states of the Union.''
</P>
<P>
   One part of the project is to find, microfilm and make available
through the Internet the poetry, fiction, essays, plays and
editorials published in some 900 Spanish-language newspapers.
Altogether, Kanellos says, some 2,400 newspapers were published by
Hispanic communities between 1808 and 1960.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mission of the newspaper was greater than, for instance, a
newspaper in Mexico City or Madrid or Havana,'' Kanellos says. ``In
this immigrant or native community the mission was to preserve the
language and the culture. (That was) stated very clearly. And they
felt that the highest model was literary.''
</P>
<P>
   The project funds visits archives by scholars, who catalog and
index any written material that could classify as Hispanic
literature, from botanical treatises to novels. Kanellos estimates
that a thousand people nationwide are involved in the recovery
project.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the material will be published only in electronic form,
but Arte Publico currently has in print 15 books that also serve as
examples of recovered literature. These include Leonor Villegas de
Magnon's ``The Rebel,'' a never-published autobiography written in
the 1920s by a Mexican-American feminist who served as a nurse in
the Mexican Revolution. The manuscript was found in the Houston
home of Villegas' descendants.
</P>
<P>
   There's also Miguel Antonio Otero Jr.'s early biography of
gunfighter Billy the Kid and Mara Amparo Ruiz de Burton's novel
``The Squatter and the Don,'' published in 1885 and offering
insight into the response of California Mexicans to the U.S.
acquisition of California after the Mexican-American War.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the impact of the project, Kanellos says, ``It has
helped us understand how the (Hispanic) community organized itself
over the history of the United States and how the culture was
created and seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanellos is upbeat about the prospects of the Recovery Project
and of Arte Publico Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 20 years you know you can survive, you know you can make
up for your mistakes,'' he says. ``Our mission is clear, and there
will be a mission for us for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   That mission ranges beyond publishing books for classrooms and
general readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ultimate goal is hemispheric integration,'' he says. ``We
believe in the New World identity, rather than (the idea) of the
United States being a simulacrum of Europe. We believe that the
United States is part of this hemisphere and needs to identify and
recognize common ground with the rest of the Americas.''

WE ARE NOT BEMUSED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The words we argue most about, at any given moment in history,
are what Bryan Garner calls ``skunked terms'' _ they're so tainted
by the debate between the traditionalists and the innovators that
it's hard to use them unself-consciously, whichever side you're on.
Hopefully is the prime example, and Garner's Dictionary of Modern
American Usage (1998) also has entries on data, decimate, enormity,
and other such troublemakers.
</P>
<P>
   While we're rooting for our favorites in these long-running
fights, though, other words are quietly slipping out of their old
meanings and putting on new ones, as secretly as caterpillars
growing into butterflies. One of these is bemused, which seems to
have taken flight almost unnoticed by the traditionalists who would
have tried to pin it down.
</P>
<P>
   Bemused is supposed to mean ``utterly muddled, stupefied,
confused, bewildered'' or, more benignly, ``preoccupied,
distracted.'' But that doesn't seem to be the intent of most
writers using it in recent decades, even the usage writers: ``When
these items are couched in truly criminal syntax, some bemused
reader is sure to send the clippings my way,'' wrote columnist
James J. Kilpatrick in 1998. And William Safire, in 1993, advised
Clinton to ``take control of the East Room. (Presidential press
conferences) are not occasions to look bemused at confusion and to
marvel at `self-selection' by shouting reporters.''
</P>
<P>
   And here are a few from the Globe:
</P>
<P>
   --``After a half-hour that focused almost exclusively on Silber,
it was left to a bemused John Moffitt, campaign manager for William
Weld, to remind the panel that Weld won the election.''
</P>
<P>
   --``It was the music that astonished audiences and critics more
than the choreography, though they were more bemused than
outraged.''
</P>
<P>
   --``As she read the story, (Virginia Buckingham, now Massport
head) was alternately `stunned and bemused.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The usage advisers who've noticed the new bemused on the wing
tend to caution against using it as a synonym for amused, but that
doesn't seem to be what's happening: Sometimes the two words are
even paired, as in the Globe story reporting that ``Dylan seemed
alternately bemused and amused by his brief foray into prime
time.'' We seem to want bemused to blend ``faintly amused'' and
``faintly surprised,'' often with a dash of irony. It's still a
work in progress, though, so opinions and usage samples that will
help refine the definition are welcome.
</P>
<P>
   But hold the objections, please. It's too late for that: Bemused
is simply doing what all our words do through the centuries,
finding the niche where it's most likely to survive. We don't need
the older bemused anymore: We have more colorful words for drunks
and daydreamers. Nor are Muse-based puns _ bemused to mean
enraptured by one's muse _ much in demand these days.
</P>
<P>
   What we do need is an agreement on the meaning of bemused, now
that we like it so much. As one usage guide noted a decade ago, the
word is ``slippery to handle''; it's time to get a grip, or some
readers will be bothered, bewildered, and not at all bewitched.

&HT;        FOOD PRODUCERS FORESEE BATTLE OVER BIOTECHNOLOGY IN TRADE
TALKS
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Alex Canizares  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Nov. 15 - For the U.S. food industry, lowering trade
barriers on biologically altered food products will prove to be a
bone of contention between the U.S. and European countries at
upcoming trade talks, a food lobby coalition said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Round Agricultural Committee, a coalition of 90 farm
industry associations that supports elimination of barriers to food
trade, represents several industries that biologically engineer
their products to modify their shape or size. The coalition seeks a
World Trade Organization ruling that would ensure that these
products get unrestricted access to foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
   But the panel of industry officials at the press conference said
they don't expect the Europeans to change their position without a
struggle in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they [the European Union] are going to be pursuing
this very hard,'' said Dean Kleckner, president of the American
Farm Bureau Federation. ``This is the toughest issue that's facing
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Under current WTO rules, member countries have the right to
block food imports they deem as risks to people's health or the
environment. While American farmers lead other nations in the
commercial application of agricultural biotechnology, some of the
15 European Union countries believe altered food is unsafe, and
uphold barriers on their importation.
</P>
<P>
   Corn, cotton, and soybean industries, which use biotechnology
for 35 to 50 percent of their total output, argue it makes for a
superior product. Representing these industries, the coalition
claims the trade barriers are politically motivated and not
scientifically sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must not allow non-science-based safety standards, which do
nothing to protect consumers, to erect artificial barriers to
international trade,'' said John Cady, president and CEO of the
National Food Processors Association.
</P>
<P>
   On the biotechnology dispute, Kleckner said he favored forming a
separate negotiating group within the talks to focus solely on t

AT THE ATLANTIC'S HELM, TWO CONTRASTING SKIPPERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The two men who recently took over the helm of The
Atlantic Monthly, Boston's 142-year-old literary landmark that was
once home to Emerson and Thoreau, could not seem more different.
</P>
<P>
   David Bradley, 46, is a disarmingly soft-spoken and idealistic
entrepreneur. Michael Kelly, 42, is a high-profile Beltway
columnist best known for his searing criticism of the Clinton White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Odds were that the first meeting between Kelly and Bradley would
be the last. It was 1997, and Bradley had abandoned his thoughts of
public office and was turning his attention to publishing. Having
just purchased the National Journal, he was looking for a name
journalist to bring some buzz to the little-known Washington
insider magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly had just been fired as editor of The New Republic after
clashing with its owner, Martin Peretz. But he was a hot commodity
who was talking to The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The
New Yorker about his next job. He agreed to meet Bradley largely as
a courtesy.
</P>
<P>
   Something clicked. The two men talked for almost 12 hours over
two days, and Kelly signed on to become David Bradley's new star
columnist. It is an unlikely team, the modest multimillionaire with
the Swarthmore and Harvard pedigree, and the combative career
journalist with a degree from the University of New Hampshire. And
now it is entrusted with the future of Boston's venerable and
vulnerable Atlantic Monthly, which Bradley bought from Mort
Zuckerman in September for about $17 million. The test is whether
they can transform the much-respected but oft-ignored Atlantic into
the highbrow magazine of the moment, perhaps filling the void
created when Tina Brown tarted up The New Yorker with S &AMP; M and
O.J.
</P>
<P>
   They face formidable obstacles. Both men are native
Washingtonians who are strangers to Boston's literary and social
culture. Bradley is but a novice when it comes to general-interest
magazine publishing, and Kelly's role as a noisy Beltway pundit
raises questions about how well he can adapt to a publication that
takes a broader view of the world.
</P>
<P>
   But they also bring assets to the table. Bradley is considered a
benevolent, generous owner who may be willing to lavish the kind of
tender loving care and resources on a magazine that clearly was not
Zuckerman's priority in recent years. And Kelly, by all accounts
the possessor of a keen mind, brings a resume that includes major
magazine duty, and that responds to the kind of varied interests
that make him, in his own words, ``a generalist . . . not a
political junkie.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, they have one huge advantage: a chemistry rarely seen
between owner and editor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have found each other and are completely sympatico,''
said Atlantic senior editor Jack Beatty, who met them after the
sale. ``They have a real singular relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   News accounts of Bradley buying The Atlantic were filled with
unlikely descriptions. The Washington Post called him ``unusually
self-effacing,'' and The New York Times went with ``sweet natured
Mr. Rogers.'' The Web site for Bradley's Advisory Board Co.
strategic research firm _ half of which was spun off in a $142
million public offering this year _ lists not only its strengths,
but, remarkably, its ``weaknesses.'' Bradley is not your typical
ego- and bottom line-driven media mogul.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep thinking there's a catch here,'' said Craig Crawford,
editor of the Hotline newsletter that is part of Bradley's National
Journal Group. ``I keep thinking he's going to turn into Howard
Hughes or Rupert Murdoch. . . . He has this very compelling,
intense, yet quiet manner that just draws you in. At first, I
thought I'd become part of a cult.''
</P>
<P>
   The product of what he calls ``a lovely, nice start in life,''
Bradley attended Sidwell Friends School in Washington, went to
Swarthmore, and then to Harvard, where he got an MBA. He served as
a White House intern during the year Richard M. Nixon resigned and
then taught economics in the Philippines on a Fulbright
scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, he started the Advisory Board Co. as part of a
master plan to strike it rich young and pursue his goal of becoming
a Maryland senator. Then, on a long plane flight to Vietnam in
1994, Bradley had an epiphany.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had this terrible moment of complete solitude'' and realized
that ``I don't have the gift,'' he said. ``There is no leadership
gift within me. There has never been an occasion where I could walk
into a room and light it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Deciding that he would have to ``audit politics without taking
the course,'' Bradley, in 1997, bought the National Journal Group
of publications and began his second career.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before he hooked up with Bradley, Kelly had a long, strange
trip. Also raised in Washington, he is the son of liberal community
activists who worked in the newspaper business. (His mother,
Marguerite Kelly, still writes a syndicated parenting column.)
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from UNH in 1979, Kelly got a job scheduling
guests for ``Good Morning America.'' In the early '80s he moved to
The Cincinnati Post and then to The Sun in Baltimore, where he
covered Michael S. Dukakis's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly met his wife, Madelyn, then a CNN producer, on that
campaign, and followed her to Chicago, where he struggled as a
freelancer until the Gulf War came along. He covered that conflict
for The Boston Globe and The New Republic, which won him a National
Magazine Award for reporting. ``It was the first time I had ever
written anything that I thought was good,'' he said. (He later
wrote a book on the war called ``Martyrs' Day.'')
</P>
<P>
   Kelly was then hired to cover the 1992 presidential campaign by
The New York Times. Two years later, he moved to The New Yorker to
write its ``Letter from Washington,'' a stint marred by fractious
relations between Kelly and a Clinton-adoring staff member, Sidney
Blumenthal, who went to work at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Peretz offered Kelly the job of editing The New
Republic, his respected journal of opinion. By that time, Kelly was
becoming known as a fierce Clinton critic, a view enunciated in a
1994 piece on the president's flawed character for The New York
Times Sunday magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly says his upbringing was ``moralistic, but moralistic in
the political sense, not the religious sense. . . . What I objected
to'' with Clinton, he said, ``was really one thing, honesty. It was
always the lying that mattered to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Observers wondered whether Kelly, who continued to pound the
White House in his New Republic column, could mesh with Peretz, who
had a well-known fondness for Vice President Al Gore. In nine
months, the answer was clear. Kelly was fired.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly says he was dismissed three days after he vetoed Peretz's
effort to insert an unsigned ``Notebook'' item into the magazine
defending Gore against allegations of campaign finance violations.
Peretz says Kelly was a very good ``line editor,'' but ``not a big
ideas person'' and ``obsessive'' in his criticism of the
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned that I loved to edit, loved to play with ideas and
writers,'' Kelly said of his tenure there.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When he sought out the former New Republic editor, Bradley knew
of Kelly's sharp-edged commentary. ``You'd assume he was sort of
nasty,'' Bradley said. Kelly ``has a gift that I could not
understand from the political writing I had seen.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, after the National Journal editor Steve Smith left for
US News &AMP; World Report and Kelly replaced him on an interim basis,
Bradley presented him with a crucial decision. Bradley had dreams
of a ``Henry Luce moment'' and of starting his own high-end
general-interest magazine. He asked for Kelly's long-term
commitment to follow him on that journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never plotted out my life in anything remotely like those
lengths of time,'' said Kelly, who waited several months before
agreeing to Bradley's request. But ``I knew he was good for his
word, I knew he was serious about building and creating magazines
and editorial businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, a month and a half ago, after lengthy negotiations
interrupted by an illness that robbed him of his voice, the largely
unknown Bradley became the surprise owner of The Atlantic Monthly.
(He now jokes how ``it's the saddest thing'' that his mother has
been able to fill only four pages of her new scrapbook with
clippings about Bradley.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very elegant moment,'' he said, ``to figure out if we
can understand this business.''
</P>
<P>
   The best reason for optimism at The Atlantic may be the National
Journal. Under Bradley, the editorial budget nearly doubled, said
the president and publisher, John Fox Sullivan. And Kelly hired 25
new editorial people in two years. Sullivan said that at the first
major strategy meeting he convened after buying the journal,
Bradley told his executives: ``Let's not worry about the money.
Let's figure out how to make it the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also seems to be talking about pouring resources into
his new acquisition _ at least for the near future. ``I think I
should be prepared, if need be, to lose a couple million a year
with The Atlantic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his new North End office, Kelly is surrounded by
manuscripts and a flow chart of The Atlantic's operations. While
trying to get up to speed, he suggests that some changes _ from
expanding the number of pages to new graphics to more emphasis on
books _ are in the offing. He walks a fine line, suggesting changes
to the magazine but promising not to alter its mission and
philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a reader's magazine,'' he said. ``It needs to be a
magazine for people who are passionate about reading and passionate
about writing. It has made a home for pieces that are allowed to
stand on their own for great writing. They're not buzz driven or
celebrity driven.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some observers wonder whether Kelly, with his Beltway
background, is a good fit for a big-ideas magazine. Peretz has
asked whether a Washington journalist with a newspaper background
understands The Atlantic ``sensibility.'' But the outgoing Atlantic
editor, William Whitworth, seems reassured. One night over dinner,
he and Kelly talked about ``the kind of journalism we admire, the
kind of writers we admire. . . . In that sense, we were in the same
ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   From when they first met, Bradley said, he sensed that what
Kelly ``really wanted was to be editor of The New Yorker.'' The
Atlantic's new owner has not quite handed his editor that
opportunity. But only a few years after engaging him in a unique
journalistic partnership, he has come remarkably close.

 HOUSTON: x x x market it as fiction.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The California-based Villasenor gave back his $75,000 advance
and took his manuscript to Arte Publico, which published ``Rain of
Gold'' in 1991 as its first hardcover. The book remains in print in
hardcover from Arte Publico and in paperback from Bantam.
</P>
<P>
   ```The Rain of Gold' experience was crucial for us, because it
taught us how to publish a hardcover release and really slug it out
with the big boys,'' Kanellos says.
</P>
<P>
   The book was a regional best seller, but the press encountered
resistance when trying to sell nationwide. Some parts of the
country simply weren't receptive to Latino literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``One wholesaler didn't take `Rain of Gold' because the cover
was, quote, too ethnic, unquote,'' Kanellos says. The lucrative
Northeast market in particular is tough to crack for Hispanic
writers, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Of the manuscripts Arte Publico publishes, about 30 percent to
40 percent are submitted by literary agents. But Arte Publico is
``one of the few presses that still opens the mail,'' Kanellos
says, which means its editors actually look at unsolicited
material. He estimates that another 30 percent to 40 percent of
Arte Publico titles come ``over the transom,'' in the phrase of the
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Graciela Limon's ``In Search of Bernabe'' (1993), winner of an
American Book Award, is one over-the-transom title that has done
well. Last spring Limon published ``The Day of the Moon,'' her
fourth book with Arte Publico.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder come from authors who have become part of the Arte
Publico ``stable.'' Poet Pat Mora, children's author Judith Ortiz
Cofer and novelist Nicholasa Mohr are among that number.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether the press gets more than 2,000 submissions each year
for its 30 to 35 publishing slots, Kanellos says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We invest in (new authors), which is hard. The hardest part of
publishing fiction is launching that first book, when nobody knows
the author.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite often that first book goes down the drain and you don't
sell anything. So when we do this we have to be thinking about the
second book, and that works out quite often.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the best-known authors who have published with Arte
Publico are poet Sandra Cisneros and novelists Ana Castillo and
Julia Alvarez.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds to three-fourths of Arte Publico books are by
Mexican-American authors. But the press is stretching into
Cuban-American literature simply because so many new young writers,
like Florida's Virgil Suarez, are producing good material.
</P>
<P>
   And the press has embarked on a project to reprint all the
fiction of Jose Yglesias, an important Cuban-American writer who
died in 1995 and who wrote more than a dozen books of fiction and
nonfiction beginning in the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   A relatively small number of titles by Puerto Rican writers
fills out the catalog.
</P>
<P>
   The press has 16 full-time and more than 20 part-time staff
members.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues from books total more than $1 million a year. The press
also receives grant support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to break even every year as a nonprofit
(organization),'' Kanellos says. ``Most years we break even and
bank a little bit. A couple years we ran a deficit.''
</P>
<P>
   Arte Publico aggressively advertises itself as ``the oldest and
largest publisher of U.S. Hispanic literature.'' Kanellos says only
two other publishers in the country share the same mission_
Bilingual Press at Arizona State University in Tempe and a Cuban
exile publisher in Miami, Ediciones Universal, which publishes only
in Spanish. (The Pittsburgh-based journal Latin American Literary
Review publishes six or seven titles a year in translation.) Among
the press' most important activities is the Recovering the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic Literary Heritage Project.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning of his career, Kanellos realized that
American Hispanics had produced a vast amount of literature over
the centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, much of it was, if not lost, at least
unavailable, sitting uncataloged in archives or squirreled away in
people's attics.
</P>
<P>
   Americo Paredes, the great folklorist with whom Kanellos studied
as a doctoral student at the University of Texas, pointed out the
importance of Spanish-language newspapers, which published stories,
essays and poetry as well as traditional journalism. Paredes
himself first published poetry in San Antonio and Brownsville
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody should try to find those old papers, Paredes said.
</P>
<P>
   But it really wasn't until the mid-1980s that the cohort of
scholars specializing in Latino culture was large enough and had
enough clout in academia to launch a major research project to
recover lost Hispanic literature. By the early 1990s the advent of
the Internet made researching this material much easier.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, funding from the Rockefeller Foundation helped launch
Recovering the U.S. Hispanic Literary Heritage Project. Its goal:
``to locate, identify, preserve and make accessible the literary
contributions of U.S. Hispanics from colonial times through 1960 in
what today comprises the 50 states of the Union.''
</P>
<P>
   One part of the project is to find, microfilm and make available
through the Internet the poetry, fiction, essays, plays and
editorials published in some 900 Spanish-language newspapers.
Altogether, Kanellos says, some 2,400 newspapers were published by
Hispanic communities between 1808 and 1960.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mission of the newspaper was greater than, for instance, a
newspaper in Mexico City or Madrid or Havana,'' Kanellos says. ``In
this immigrant or native community the mission was to preserve the
language and the culture. (That was) stated very clearly. And they
felt that the highest model was literary.''
</P>
<P>
   The project funds visits archives by scholars, who catalog and
index any written material that could classify as Hispanic
literature, from botanical treatises to novels. Kanellos estimates
that a thousand people nationwide are involved in the recovery
project.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the material will be published only in electronic form,
but Arte Publico currently has in print 15 books that also serve as
examples of recovered literature. These include Leonor Villegas de
Magnon's ``The Rebel,'' a never-published autobiography written in
the 1920s by a Mexican-American feminist who served as a nurse in
the Mexican Revolution. The manuscript was found in the Houston
home of Villegas' descendants.
</P>
<P>
   There's also Miguel Antonio Otero Jr.'s early biography of
gunfighter Billy the Kid and Mara Amparo Ruiz de Burton's novel
``The Squatter and the Don,'' published in 1885 and offering
insight into the response of California Mexicans to the U.S.
acquisition of California after the Mexican-American War.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the impact of the project, Kanellos says, ``It has
helped us understand how the (Hispanic) community organized itself
over the history of the United States and how the culture was
created and seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanellos is upbeat about the prospects of the Recovery Project
and of Arte Publico Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 20 years you know you can survive, you know you can make
up for your mistakes,'' he says. ``Our mission is clear, and there
will be a mission for us for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   That mission ranges beyond publishing books for classrooms and
general readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ultimate goal is hemispheric integration,'' he says. ``We
believe in the New World identity, rather than (the idea) of the
United States being a simulacrum of Europe. We believe that the
United States is part of this hemisphere and needs to identify and
recognize common ground with the rest of the Americas.''

 HOUSTON: x x x market it as fiction.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The California-based Villasenor gave back his $75,000 advance
and took his manuscript to Arte Publico, which published ``Rain of
Gold'' in 1991 as its first hardcover. The book remains in print in
hardcover from Arte Publico and in paperback from Bantam.
</P>
<P>
   ```The Rain of Gold' experience was crucial for us, because it
taught us how to publish a hardcover release and really slug it out
with the big boys,'' Kanellos says.
</P>
<P>
   The book was a regional best seller, but the press encountered
resistance when trying to sell nationwide. Some parts of the
country simply weren't receptive to Latino literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``One wholesaler didn't take `Rain of Gold' because the cover
was, quote, too ethnic, unquote,'' Kanellos says. The lucrative
Northeast market in particular is tough to crack for Hispanic
writers, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Of the manuscripts Arte Publico publishes, about 30 percent to
40 percent are submitted by literary agents. But Arte Publico is
``one of the few presses that still opens the mail,'' Kanellos
says, which means its editors actually look at unsolicited
material. He estimates that another 30 percent to 40 percent of
Arte Publico titles come ``over the transom,'' in the phrase of the
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Graciela Limon's ``In Search of Bernabe'' (1993), winner of an
American Book Award, is one over-the-transom title that has done
well. Last spring Limon published ``The Day of the Moon,'' her
fourth book with Arte Publico.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder come from authors who have become part of the Arte
Publico ``stable.'' Poet Pat Mora, children's author Judith Ortiz
Cofer and novelist Nicholasa Mohr are among that number.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether the press gets more than 2,000 submissions each year
for its 30 to 35 publishing slots, Kanellos says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We invest in (new authors), which is hard. The hardest part of
publishing fiction is launching that first book, when nobody knows
the author.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite often that first book goes down the drain and you don't
sell anything. So when we do this we have to be thinking about the

was the former Czechoslovakia's favorite television police
detective during communist times. A decision by Czech Television to
re-broadcast the 1970s serial has raised a fierce debate in the
Czech Republic over whether the show is propaganda or entertainment
or history. It comes at a sensitive time when the present-day
Communist Party is enjoying a surge in support amid the country's

   When famous subjects check in for a photo session with David
Lachapelle, they find themselves in a new and often bizarre
reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you stay at a hotel, you're living for one day in a place
where you don't normally live. That feeling can be true with
photographs, too,'' Lachapelle writes in his book, ``Hotel
Lachapelle'' (Bullfinch Press/Callaway; $60).
</P>
<P>
   Here you'll find Marilyn Manson working as a school crossing
guard, Madonna as a Krishna goddess, Leonardo DiCaprio becoming
Marlon Brando in ``The Wild One,'' Pamela Anderson as a saint, and
Ewan McGregor peering into a doll house while his body bleeds from
a gunshot wound fired from Barbie's diminutive gun. There are also
heads sewn onto different-colored bodies, and an overweight man
with an amazing Madonna tattoo in Lachapelle's alternate reality.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these images have been in magazines, but the
photographer has saved some of his more outrageous for the book. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Devout sports fans and casual observers alike will get caught up
in some of the greatest sports moments this century with ``And the
Crowd Goes Wild: Relive the Most Celebrated Sporting Events Ever
Broadcast,'' (book with two audio CDs) by Joe Garner, with foreword
by Hank Aaron, afterword by Wayne Gretzy and narration by Bob
Costas (Garner; $49.95).
</P>
<P>
   You'll hear how ``Monday Night Football's'' play-by-play man
made his mark when he exclaimed, ``Do you believe in miracles?
Yes,'' after the United States Olympic hockey team upset the Soviet
Union on its way to winning the gold medal in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   There's ``The Giants win the pennant! The Giants win the
pennant!'' after Bobby Thompson's dramatic home run to beat the
Dodgers in the 1951 playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   And it also includes Franco Harris making the ``Immaculate
Reception,'' Secretariat winning the Triple Crown, Babe Ruth's
World Series ``shot'' in 1932, and the dramatic penalty shootout
win in the 1999 Women's World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   This collection captures in words, images and through recordings
the essence of what makes sports so exciting.  &QL;

   If anyone can look back on the 20th century with any authority,
it's the National Geographic Society.
</P>
<P>
   In ``National Geographic Eyewitness to the 20th Century''
(National Geographic Society; $40), the last 100 years are broken
into decade-long sections, such as ``The Age of Big Business''
(1900 to 1909) and ``Challenging the Establishment'' (1960 to
1969).
</P>
<P>
   This compilation of photographs, essays and time lines
succinctly captures each era. There are a number of historical
essays by respected scholars and other experts on topics such as
``Adventure and Exploration,'' ``Mapping Our World'' and ``Earth's
Forces.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the spirit of maintaining balance between history and
popular culture, the time line section includes brief items on
everything from the moon landing in 1969 to ``Sesame Street's''
debut the same year.

   File this under something for the time capsule. Fashion designer
Rudi Gernreich in many ways pioneered the look of the trippy '60s
(think of the latest ``Austin Powers'' movie), though I'm not sure
who wore his own creations, especially the topless bathing suit.
But his frenetic-looking designs and eye-catching use of colors
remain provocative today.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Rudi Gernreich Book,'' by Peggy Moffitt and William
Claxton (Taschen; $29.99), Moffitt, who modeled most of the
clothes, provides commentary and recollections on the career of
Gernreich, who died in 1985. Well-known photographer Claxton took
the pictures, including those with Moffitt and other '60 icons such
as Steve McQueen and the Byrds. &QL;

   Thirty-seven years after her death, Marilyn Monroe still holds
sway over the public's imagination.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Marilyn Encyclopedia,'' by Adam Victor (Overlook; $55),
a 350-page volume, Victor lavishly chronicles every bit of news,
trivia and folklore involving Monroe, from what she said, to what
she read, what she listened to, and what was said about her. There
are tons of photos _ from the candid to the glamorous _ information
about her films, quotes from reviews, anecdotes, gossip and famous
sayings. All of Marilyn's relationships _ husbands, lovers, family
members, directors, co-stars _ are catalogued, as are conspiracy
theories about her death. There is a photo taken in 1961 on the set
of ``The Misfits'' with the caption pointing out that it's possible
to ``detect the first signs of aging on Marilyn's face,'' a
reminder of how her early death contributed to her legend. &QL;

   These are ``photographs of people with nothing more in common
than that they are women (and living in America at the end of the
20th century), all _ well almost all _ fully clothed,'' writes
Susan Sontag in the preface of Annie Leibovitz's latest work,
``Women'' (Random House; $75).
</P>
<P>
   Leibovitz, who in her years working for Rolling Stone, Vogue and
Vanity Fair magazines photographed hundreds of celebrities, has
turned her lens on a wide range of subjects, from those in the
arts, such as playwright/performer Anna Deavere Smith, to those in
the fields, including farmer Karen Fedrau. Also included in this
extraordinary collection of black-and-white and color portraits are
coal miners, socialites, first ladies, artists, domestic-violence
victims, an astronaut, a surgeon, a maid and Leibovitz's mother.
``Each of these pictures must stand on its own,'' Sontag writes,
but Leibovitz's collection makes some unexpected connections.

U.N. SECRETARY GENERAL DISCUSSES OUTLAWED SECT WITH BEIJING
OFFICIALS 
</HEADLINE>
 PM-CHINA-ANNAN-NYT  (gm) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Kofi Annan, the U.N. secretary general, said Tuesday
that China's foreign minister gave him ``a better understanding''
of the government's crackdown on the outlawed Falun Gong spiritual
movement in a meeting here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Annan said he had been assured that the ``fundamental rights''
are being observed of Falun Gong practitioners, thousands of whom
have been jailed or harassed in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government, with the acquiescence of the United
Nations, has restricted Annan's availability to the press during
his visit but he answered questions during a brief session with a
handful of foreign photographers, television cameramen and one
Asian newspaper reporter, who later distributed a transcript of
Annan's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before Annan's meeting with the foreign minister, Tang
Jiaxuan, some 15 Falun Gong adherents were detained in Tiananmen
Square as they unfurled a banner and began their ritual exercises,
which are said to bring good health and spiritual salvation. Groups
of believers from at least five regions of China have reportedly
sent Annan letters asking for an official inquiry into China's
branding of the group as an illegal, ``evil cult.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, before his arrival here on Sunday for a four-day
visit to discuss U.N. peacekeeping and other topics, Annan said he
planned to make inquiries about the severe crackdown on the
movement, which had attracted millions of followers in China before
it was banned in July.
</P>
<P>
   In his brief public remarks Monday, Annan was clearly loath to
offend China _ a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I leave here with a better understanding of some of
the issues involved,'' he said, adding that Tang told him ``that in
dealing with this issue, the fundamental rights of citizens will be
respected and some of the actions they are taking are for the
protection of individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to clarify Annan's remarks, a spokesman for the
secretary general, Manoel de Almeida e Silva, said Tuesday night by
telephone that in the meeting with the foreign minister, Annan had
also ``impressed upon them the importance of respecting the
fundamental rights of those involved.''
</P>
<P>
   In that meeting, Annan also offered United Nations help in
strengthening the government's capacity to deal with the Falun Gong
problem ``in accordance with international norms,'' Silva said.
Tang gave no response, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong members, whose leader, Li Hongzhi, is in exile in New
York, shocked the government last April when some 10,000 of them
gathered for an illegal demonstration in Beijing, demanding
official recognition. Since banning the group in July and calling
it a dangerous cult, the government has charged dozens of the
group's top leaders with serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands who have refused to renounce their beliefs have
suffered temporary detentions, been threatened with firings, and in
some cases, been sentenced to labor camps.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government calls the ongoing crackdown ``a violation of
international human rights standards as set forth in instruments
including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
that China has signed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no evidence that practitioners have done anything
other than peacefully exercise their internationally recognized
rights,'' a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy here said Tuesday.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: U.S. spanks world in juvenile punishment
 &HT;    (Eds: Updating with verdict in Michigan case.)
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A recent event in the U.S. Supreme Court that went virtually
unnoticed in this country would have been decried as
incomprehensibly inhumane in almost every other nation.
</P>
<P>
   The justices blew off the appeal of a Nevada man sentenced to
death for two murders committed when he was 16. His lawyers argued
that his execution would violate the International Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights, which bars capital punishment for
crimes committed before age 18.
</P>
<P>
   The court's indifference was no surprise. The justices ruled 10
years ago that execution for killings by 16-year-olds is
constitutionally hunky-dory. In ratifying the 1992 covenant, the
Senate, at President George Bush's request, specifically reserved
the right to execute the young. The Clinton administration urged
the justices to disallow the Nevada appeal.
</P>
<P>
   It is pretty much a settled matter for most Americans that
execution for juvenile murder is, like a Martha Stewart
centerpiece, A Good Thing. Indeed, if there's anything Americans
like better than executing juveniles, it is executing just about
anyone else. We're a world leader.
</P>
<P>
   And in that we're increasingly in with some very creepy chums.
The only other nations that permit death sentences for youths are
Iran, Pakistan, Nigeria and Saudi Arabia. Amnesty International
says we've executed more youth offenders _ 19 _ since 1990 than the
rest of the world combined. Seventy are on our death rows.
</P>
<P>
   And when we aren't out to kill juvenile murderers, we're
increasingly tracking young offenders to long prison terms, even
lifetimes in prisons, as if they were adults.
</P>
<P>
   The current horror story in point is Michigan's conviction
Tuesday of a 13-year-old for a shooting death committed when he was
11. Nathaniel Abraham, convicted of second-degree murder,
potentially faces a life sentence. He claims the shooting was
accidental, the prosecution said calculated, but either way, how is
it possible to hold that an 11-year-old has the same degree of
responsibility, and is capable of the same premeditation, as an
adult?
</P>
<P>
   The question is especially apt in the case of Nathaniel, found
by the state's own psychologist to have had the reasoning ability
of a 6-year-old at the time of his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan lets prosecutors seek judicial approval to try any
juvenile as an adult. Even toddlers, theoretically. Forty-six
states have adopted laws in recent years permitting some juveniles
to be tried and sentenced as adults.
</P>
<P>
   Does it surprise anyone that there's a huge racial disproportion
in the results? Black kids are 15 percent of the 10-to-17
population but 50 percent of the kids transferred from juvenile to
adult courts. The system tends to send white kids to
rehabilitation, black kids to prison.
</P>
<P>
   But black and white, we've got it in for our kids to a degree
unmatched in most of the world. Maybe we really have the world's
most dangerous children. Or maybe we just have some of the world's
most violent adults.

IT'S NO USE TRYING TO HERD BAPTISTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By PAUL HARRAL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reading about the Texas Baptists meeting in El Paso, Texas,
recently, I was reminded of a favorite Will Rogers quote: ``I
belong to no organized party. I am a Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes I feel that way: I belong to no organized
denomination. I am a Baptist.
</P>
<P>
   I like it like that.
</P>
<P>
   A favorite joke among those few who actually worry about things
like the Texas Constitution is that after Reconstruction, Texans
distrusted government so much that they deliberately designed one
that wouldn't work. The framers could have been taking their cues
from the Baptists, especially Southern Baptists.
</P>
<P>
   If you think I overstate, please consider the most recent flap
among Southern Baptists.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, the Southern Baptist Commission adopted the Baptist
Faith and Message Statement. The statement outlines the basic set
of beliefs that Baptists hold and is similar to those of many other
denominations. The Baptist statement says Jesus was born of a
virgin, died for our sins and was bodily resurrected and that the
Bible is an infallible guide.
</P>
<P>
   Some would say that the Southern Baptist Convention is locked in
a fundamentalist-vs.-liberal fight. That's not true. There are no
liberal Baptists, at least religiously.
</P>
<P>
   The most you can be is moderate, and most moderates in the
convention easily supported the 1963 statement. But when the
convention amended it in 1998 to ask Christian wives ``to submit
graciously to the servant leadership of their husbands,''
controversy erupted.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment begins: ``The husband and wife are of equal worth
before God, since both are created in God's image. ... A husband is
to love his wife even as Christ loved the church.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good. But then the amendment said: ``A wife is to
submit herself graciously to the servant leadership of her husband
even as the church willingly submits itself to the headship of
Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   As is usual in religious arguments, people on all sides of this
issue quote Scripture to support their positions.
</P>
<P>
   But there is more at work here. The Rev. Charles Wade of
Arlington said that the El Paso decision to stick with the 1963
wording without the amendment dealing with the role of wives sends
a message that Texas Baptists do not want to see radical changes in
the central statement of Southern Baptist beliefs. The national
convention recently appointed a committee to rewrite the entire
Baptist statement of faith.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to the decision in Texas _ somewhat of a maverick state
convention among Southern Baptists these days _ was immediate from
the more conservative leaders of the convention.
</P>
<P>
   So what's a poor Baptist to do when faced with obviously
conflicting opinions among the leaders of the denomination?
</P>
<P>
   The same thing that Baptists have done for most of their
history. They are supposed to figure it out for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   A treasured Baptist belief is in the ``priesthood of the
believer,'' the concept that every Baptist everywhere is ultimately
responsible for his or her relationship with God.
</P>
<P>
   Baptists are to read the Scripture, educate themselves about the
issues, and listen to their scholars and their pastors. And after
prayer, they are supposed to make their own decisions.
</P>
<P>
   One of the wonders of being a Baptist is that there is no
national or worldwide organization _ only cooperative associations.
The power in Baptist circles is vested in the local church and,
beyond that, in the individual believer.
</P>
<P>
   People commenting on the difficulty of getting a group of
independent thinkers to do anything together sometimes say it's
like trying to herd cats. You could substitute ``herd Baptists''
and have the same image.
</P>
<P>
   So, in the end, it doesn't much matter what the Southern Baptist
Convention does _ or, for that matter, the Baptist General
Convention of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   What Baptists believe is going to be settled in local churches
and by individuals.
</P>
<P>
   If I had to bet, I'd bet on Baptist women. They already do most
of the church work anyway. To which we men usually graciously
submit.

</P>
<P>
   Breckenridge is a respectable town, big enough for a couple of
banks, several feed stores and a line of merchants along the main
drag. It calls itself ``The Dynamo of West Texas'' and it is
scrubbed and cleaned, well-marked and colorful.
</P>
<P>
   But the muscular-looking Stephens County Courthouse appears
bigger than it should for a town this size. The bank with the big
``B'' on top is taller than you would expect.
</P>
<P>
   Breckenridge was once a boomtown well beyond its current size.
</P>
<P>
   Oil was discovered in the nearby Ranger field in 1916 and in the
next four years, exploration spread north. In 1920, Breckenridge
exploded from 1,500 residents to more than 10,000, and an estimated
200 wells were drilled within the city limits. The boom lasted only
a few years, and now the town has a more stable population of about
5,500. But signs of the boom are still there. You can see them
painted on the buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The largest mural is on the side of a vacant building at Court
Street and Walker, which is U.S. 180 running through the heart of
town. The painting is huge _ a half-block long and 2 stories high _
done in black and white and various shades of gray. The scene is a
football field, surrounded by townsfolk hanging on every free inch
of the fence.
</P>
<P>
   The band and student body take up the grandstands; the teams are
on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Hovering above the playing field, in a nearly transparent white,
are ghostly figures of players from the past. The mural is titled
The Spirit of the Buckaroos, in honor of the local high school
team.
</P>
<P>
   The scene, minus the ghost players, is taken from a 1924 photo.
There is a panel on the side that chronicles the Buckaroos'
successes. It says the team was state co-champion in 1929 and 1959,
and state champ in 1951, '52, '54, and '58.
</P>
<P>
   There are six murals in all. The most popular is a 1923 street
scene painted behind the drive-through of First American Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was our first black and white and it's lighted at
night,'' said Shelly Hargrove, manager of Main Street Breckenridge.
``People love that one. It is the closest to the original
photograph of any of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Older residents especially enjoy the murals, she said. ``Some of
them actually remember what Breckenridge was like back then. It
really stirs up the history of this town.''
</P>
<P>
   Breckenridge's murals were recognized Friday as the state's best
public improvement project by the Texas Downtown Association at its
conference in Houston. Artist Billy Ines painted all six murals and
although Hargrove said Breckenridge has three more planned for him,
he might be hard to pin down.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we were in Houston for the award, there was a line of
people waiting to talk to him,'' she said. ``Nacogdoches,
Gatesville, Brenham, Quanah ... and I get calls almost weekly from
places around here, Throckmorton, Graham and Eastland. They all
want him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to remind him he still has work to do right here. We
have a lot more history.''

<P>
   Q: Since student loans have been introduced, what percentage
have been paid off and what percentage of students have defaulted
altogether?
</P>
<P>
   _ R.M., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: As of November 1997, 35.4 percent of the borrowed money has
been paid off and 8.8 percent was given to recipients who
defaulted, according to congressional testimony by David A.
Longanecker of the Office of Postsecondary Education.
</P>
<P>
   Longanecker testified that the federal government had made $285
billion in higher education loans to students and parents since
1959.
</P>
<P>
   Of these loans, $101 billion has been repaid and $68 billion was
loaned to students who are still in school. In the remaining $116
billion due to be repaid, $25 billion was loaned to students who
have defaulted on their obligation.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Department of Education began removing schools from
loan eligibility if too many students defaulted, the yearly default
rate has dropped from 22 percent in 1990 to 8 percent in 1997.

   JOBS: Amid all the hand-wringing in Kansas City about the
probable and possible job losses at Sprint and Hoechst, a new
Brookings Institution report shows Kansas City enjoyed some of the
best job growth in the country at the beginning of the current
economic expansion, from 1993-96. The metro area ranked 9th among
the 30 most-populated metros. Also, data from the U.S. Bureau of
Labor Statistics shows this decade is Kansas City's best job-growth
performance in at least three decades. Jeffrey Spivak and Brad

CHINA DENIES BUYING AIRBORNE RADAR SYSTEM, DESPITE ISRAELI
ADMISSION 
</HEADLINE>
 PM-CHINA-ARMS-NYT  (gm) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ A government spokesman denied Tuesday that China's
military had bought an advanced airborne radar system from Israel,
even though Israeli officials have privately admitted it to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   At a regular press briefing Tuesday, Sun Yuxi, a foreign
ministry spokesman, was asked about recent press reports that
Israel is installing the $250 million radar system on a
Russian-built aircraft for delivery to China. ``I don't think what
you just mentioned exists,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no defense cooperation between China and Israel,''
Sun said. American defense officials say that Israel has secretly
sold China billions of dollars worth of weapons over recent years,
in part to help sustain Israel's domestic defense industry.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, The New York Times reported that Pentagon officials
had urged Israel not to sell more radar-equipped planes to China.
The early-warning radar system, said to be comparable to the
American AWACS system, would bolster China's abilities in a battle
with Taiwan, or with American forces seeking to defend Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   China is rushing to modernize its outdated air and naval forces,
which now have little capacity to fight a prolonged battle far from
shore.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis did not deny the sale, but said that no
American-supplied technology was involved in the radar system so
there was no violation of U.S. export controls, according to
Pentagon officials.
</P>
<P>
   According to Defense Department officials and press reports from
Israel, workers at Elta, a subsidiary of Israel Aircraft
Industries, have mounted the Israeli radar complex, known as the
Phalcon, on a Russian-made cargo plane for future delivery to
China. American officials say China has asked to buy at least four
more of the radar systems, also for installation on Russian-built
planes.

THE COMPASSION GAP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; _ Conservatism in Texas desperately needs the
veneer of compassion, which is supplied by the ideologically nimble
George W. Bush as if he were seeking absolution, not solutions.
</P>
<P>
   There is, after all, so much to be compassionate about in the
vast policy wasteland of Texas. And from a governor whose leading
guru has a strange explanation for the societal ills that affect
Texas almost more than any other state: the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Myron Magnet's assignment of blame is not to the '60s as
experienced by the president-in-waiting _ a boozy, frat house
mediocrity that afflicted him well into the 1980s. No, it was the
``liberal'' 1960s, whose cultural and political causes deprived the
poor of their initiative and led them to fail to take advantage of
the limitless opportunities set before them years later by Ronald
Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, really.
</P>
<P>
   Magnet, one of the mainstays of the New York-based Manhattan
Institute, has been supplying Bush with conceptual drivel since the
year before Bush ran for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Another think tank has had special meaning for Bush, the
Dallas-based National Center for Policy Alternatives. Its
president, John Goodman, is also a health-care adviser to the GOP
front-runner, and was a key appointee to a Texas commission
examining a problem Texas faces like no other state _ one in four
residents has no insurance. Ideally, Goodman would privatize both
Social Security and Medicare and substitute the magic of tax
credits, as well as jettison such enemies of the work ethic as
unemployment insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Compassionate conservatism confronts an immense landscape in
Texas, which shares with other state laboratories of the true faith
an aversion to local effort where the poor, social services, and
the public health are concerned, in favor of a reliance on the
federal government for what few policy crumbs their residents
manage to get.
</P>
<P>
   Consider what requires compassion, a partial snapshot courtesy
of that most relentless of Web sites, Bushwatch.com:
</P>
<P>
   Since Bush became governor in 1995, Texas has consistently been
first in its vast population of the uninsured. It is sometimes
first, sometimes second in uninsured kids, but consistently first
among women.
</P>
<P>
   It is also first in measured releases of toxic junk into the
air, and Houston leads in the country in its annual number of
smog-alert days.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is third in the incidence of hunger and fifth in its birth
rate for kids born to teenage parents.
</P>
<P>
   Moving toward the bottom of the barrel, Texas is 45th in women's
prenatal care. It is 46th in state effort for public libraries and
protection of water resources, as well as high school completion
rates. Texas is 47th in the delivery of social services. And it is
48th in its public health expenditures per capita, as well as its
effort on parks and recreation, and the arts. It was rated the 48th
best state in which to raise children.
</P>
<P>
   The good governor's ``self-policing'' attitude toward polluters
helps account for Texas's ranking of 49th in state effort on
environmental protection. And the state brings up the rear in its
teacher salaries and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Never one to rest on laurels, Governor Bush has in the last
couple of years been a pioneer in the abuse of welfare ``reform''
to reduce health care for children even more. The replacement of an
income maintenance entitlement with work was not supposed to affect
families' eligibility for Medicaid; but it has.
</P>
<P>
   And a new, bipartisanly supported effort to supplement Medicaid
with a federal-state program to insure kids was not supposed to be
used as a cover for Medicaid-slashing, but it has been.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Texas leads.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of 12 major states by Families USA, Bush's Texas was
by far the leader in producing since 1996 a net decline in the
number of kids covered under Medicaid and the new children's
insurance program, compared to those covered undered Medicaid alone
before. The decline was a whopping 14.2 percent, and the numerical
drop in kids' coverage (193,400) exceeded California's by more than
50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman's policy wonkery will presumably help Bush cure both
Texas's and the country's health care problems. In the meantime,
like his protege, he opposes any expansion of national efforts to
help working families afford health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   This, Myron Magnet would argue, is the essence of compassion. In
his 1993 tome ``The Dream and the Nightmare: The Sixties Legacy to
the Underclass,'' Magnet explains that counter-culture
permissiveness and the War on Poverty persuaded the poor, and
especially young, black males to prefer indolence to effort. Magnet
did not explain why this persuasion was so much more successful in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In his preoccupation with black people as the core of the
underclass, Magent is also less helpful in dealing with the
country's expanding Hispanic population, which comprises half of
Texas's nation-leading uninsured ranks. How the counter-culture
destroyed the initiative of Hispanics may be a fertile field for
conservative intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the compassion proclaimed to be so widespread
in George W. Bush's Texas may look to the rest of us like official
indifference and cruelty.

PLANT POT STAINED SEALED TILE FLOOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for Ocala, Fla. and all needing.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My sunroom's terra-cotta floor has a tinted sealer. A plant
pot was left on it, creating a white circle on the tile. How can I
remove it?
</P>
<P>
   AMY YUNES, Sharon, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Dip fine steel wool in paint thinner and rub the tile, not
too lightly but not too heavily. This will remove the spot but also
the tinted sealer, so you will have to reseal.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a door in the foundation of my house, at the bottom of
my bulkhead stairs. I would like to put a screen door in that
opening, which already has a door. It cannot open out because there
is not enough room at the bottom of the bulkhead stairs. Can I make
double doors that would open out?
</P>
<P>
   MAUREEN O'DOWD, Norwell, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, but you may have to make your own; I know of no stock
double screens that would fill a standard-width door. But you could
make your own with sturdy wood frames and well-stretched screening.
</P>
<P>
   Also there are rolling screens that you could buy. One is Mirage
Rolling Screen Door that rolls up sideways, sold by KSG Products of
Williamstown, N.J. Call 800-955-3667.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am building a house. What are the pros and cons about a
wood frame versus a steel frame; that is, one using steel studs?
What should the ``on center'' spacing be; that is, how far apart
should the studs be? I want the house to stand up to Boston winds.
How thick should the wall be? Is extra insulation worth it in walls
that have a lot of windows?
</P>
<P>
   FRANK CHASIN, Savin Hill, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Steel studs are OK to use, even for outside walls (originally
they were designed for interior walls only). The only thing you
have to do with steel studded exterior walls is to put rigid foam
insulation on the inside of such walls, because the steel studs are
notorious losers of heat; that is, without the insulation the warm
air indoors will radiate right outdoors through those metal studs.
This will happen even if regular insulation is between the studs.
As for spacing, 16 inches or 24 inches is fine.
</P>
<P>
   Six inches is OK for wall thickness, although some people feel
that there should be more insulation in the walls than the 6 inches
of fiberglass that would fit in that space. As for a wall full of
windows, you might as well have the non-window parts of the walls
highly insulated because even the best of windows are heavy losers
of heat.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Where can I find wood bifold doors 90 inches high and 36
inches wide; that is, two doors, each 18 inches wide? All I can
find is doors 78 and 80 inches high.
</P>
<P>
   JOYCE TURNER, North Reading, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. And I doubt if you will find any unless you have them made.
That would be very expensive; they are costly enough as is. But
here is what I suggest, and it is what the handyman did when he
built an extra tall closet. He reduced the opening to 80 inches
high, and build a shelf above the whole closet. You could do the
same, and put doors on the shelf as well. The handyman did not put
doors on that upper shelf, but he might. In fact, he built the
closet a year ago and has yet to put up the doors. Sh! Don't tell
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I plan to put in a new sidewalk of concrete, not asphalt. I
have heard of patterned concrete, done in the forms of stone,
brick, and other nice shapes. I have no idea of where to look. Do
you?
</P>
<P>
   JOE CALCIO, Holbrook, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yep, and that is why I filed the patterned concrete people in
my super electronic file. According to the companies' promotional
material, patterned concrete does look good. So, take your choice:
Technokrete is one brand name for decorative concrete, in Whitman,
781-447-9444, 800-236-1322; or try Increte Systems: N.E. Decorative
Concrete, Northwood, NH 03261, 603-942-9273, 800-972-9273.

<HEADLINE>
ICE, WATER SHIELD SHOULD GO OVER BARE SHEATHING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for Ocala, Fla.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am having my house reroofed, using 22 squares (2,200 square
feet) of shingles to go over one layer of old shingles. Bids ranged
from $3,200 to $4,000 and included new ridge vents. Continuous
soffit vents would be $400 more. Stripping added $1,800 to $2,000.
I am not objecting to the price, but one roofer recommended putting
Ice &AMP; Water Shield over the old shingles. Is that a good idea?
</P>
<P>
   PAT DELEO, Reading, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. In a word, no. The Ice &AMP; Water Shield is a rubberized
membrane set along the edge of the roof 3 to 6 feet up from the
roof edge, and is intended to prevent leaking from water backed up
by ice dams. The Ice &AMP; Water Shield should go over bare wood
sheathing to make it stick to the sheathing and lie flat, so enough
shingles should be removed to allow this. Even the manufacturer,
W.R. Grace, suggests that its shield go over bare sheathing.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, you certainly have no complaint about the bids;
they are all bargains. The low bid is less than $1.50 per square
foot, and the high is less than $2. If the work is of good quality,
you can't get any better. Those soffit vents for $400 are also a
good buy.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I relocated several windows and doors and, as a result, had
to reshingle around those moved windows and doors; the shingles are
white cedar Extras, and, needless to say, they differ from the
weathered shingles that remained on the house. How can I make the
new shingles look like the old?
</P>
<P>
   JACK ALDRICH, Shrewsbury, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You have three choices. No, four. The first and easiest is to
sit back and wait for the new shingles to weather. You are a little
inland for rapid weathering, which occurs fastest in a marine
environment, but in two years no one will see the difference. The
other choices require coating the entire house, or at least the
wall where the changes were made, with:
</P>
<P>
   1. Bleaching oil, which will hasten weathering and make the
color more even.
</P>
<P>
   2. Bleaching stain, which produces a rather distinct gray color,
not much like weathering.
</P>
<P>
   3. Semitransparent stain, which provides a color other than the
weathered look.
</P>
<P>
   Short of leaving everything alone and tolerating the different
colors, I suggest using the bleaching oil. Only one coat is needed
forever. The others also need only one coat, but require recoating
every five years or so.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Hi, handyman, remember me? I'm the one who was looking for
five-eighths-inch ball bearings for my glider. You found the
bearings in the McMaster-Carr catalog, and I appreciate that, but I
also found the catalog on the Net at www.mcmaster.com, and received
the needed bearings in a short time.
</P>
<P>
   CHRIS EVANS, Franklin, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Since there was no question, there is no answer, except the
handyman's appreciation of the information, which he immediately
put in his file. Thanks.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am putting in 6 inches of fiberglass insulation in my
cellar ceiling, with the vapor barrier paper up, touching the
ceiling above. What about all those wires and pipes in the ceiling;
should they be covered?
</P>
<P>
   ANTHONY COSTELLO, Melrose, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. If they are near the ceiling or between the joists, cover
them; if they are at the bottom of the joists, don't; it is simply
not practical to do so. Covering the pipes will provide insulation
so they will not freeze in the cold cellar, made colder by
insulating the ceiling. If you are concerned about no access to the
pipes and wires if they need repair, don't be. It is unlikely that
they will fail; after all, the wires and pipes in other walls and
ceilings of the house are inaccessible, and how many times have you
had to fix them? It would not hurt to insulate any exposed pipes
with foam tube insulation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My metal bulkhead doors have 7 1/2-inch-wide exterior plywood
on each side so the doors can cover the oversized opening. The
plywood does not hold paint. Can I cover it with aluminum?
</P>
<P>
   FRANK SHEA, Marblehead, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I told you on the phone that the aluminum will not hold
paint, but on second thought, you can cover the plywood with
aluminum and paint it, and keep painting it whenever it needs it.
Or, let the aluminum weather; it will turn a dull gray, which may
nor may not be acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   The plywood should hold paint, but it may not be doing so
because it is punky or because there are too many coats of paint
already on it. The second reason it is not holding paint is the
slope, which allows rain water to wear off the paint.
</P>
<P>
   One thing you can try is to replace the plywood with a 1 x 8
pressure-treated board on each side. Let the boards weather. Or,
stain them with one coat of a semitransparent stain. It will erode,
but you'll need only one coat every three to five years, and it
will not peel.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I know that driveway sealer is mostly cosmetic, but I plan to
seal my driveway to fill the cracks. Will sealer fill cracks?
</P>
<P>
   AXEL WIRTH, Amherst, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   A. Sealer will fill cracks an eighth-inch and smaller; it will
not do very well on cracks a quarter-inch or wider. Fill the wider
cracks with driveway crack filler, sold in caulking cartridges.
</P>
<P>
   Filling the cracks either way helps keep water from getting into
the cracks and then freezing in winter, making them wider. But it
is not critical to the life of the driveway.

NEW PLAYHOUSE HAS SPECIAL PLACE IN `THEATER HELL' 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Eds: Not for use before Friday,Nov. 19) 
(Eds: Fact box at bottom) 
By REED JOHNSON 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It must take a perverse sense of humor, or a penchant for
tempting fate, to open your brand-new playhouse with a work titled
``Theater Hell.''
</P>
<P>
   For David Cox, however, it's also a way of admitting a funny, if
painful, truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theater Hell is absolutely appropriate,'' says the 62-year-old
director-producer, chuckling over memories of his six-year quest to
establish a home for his 8-year-old American Renegade Theatre
Company.
</P>
<P>
   Cox's ordeal officially ended last Friday night when the
American Renegade premiered its production of ``Theater Hell,'' its
first-ever show at its new 7,500-square-foot residence at 11136
Magnolia Blvd., in the heart of North Hollywood's NoHo Arts
District. Many people credit Cox himself with spurring the creation
of NoHo, the city-sponsored confederation of small theaters, art
galleries and other businesses that has become one of the largest
such cultural enclaves in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theater Hell,'' Craig Alpaugh's comedy-farce about the
travails of a Midwestern community theater, is being used to
christen the smaller of two performance venues that occupy the
American Renegade's completely renovated two-story headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the larger, 99-seat theater will host its inaugural
show, ``The Sicilian Bachelor,'' a comedy that enjoyed a
seven-month run at the Tiffany Theaters in West Hollywood before it
was closed by the 1992 riots.
</P>
<P>
   The new building is the company's fourth residence since
January, 1994, when the Northridge earthquake leveled the American
Renegade's original home at 11305 Magnolia Blvd. For most of the
past five years, the troupe was forced to rent space in order to
produce its shows.
</P>
<P>
   The 50-member company spent two years operating out of a former
bank building at 5303 Lankershim until the clamor of MTA Red Line
subway construction forced it to relocate. It then spent 2{ years
producing shows at the Bitter Truth Theatre, _ which Cox ran in
partnership with two other producers.
</P>
<P>
   In the years between the company's devastation and its rebirth,
Cox has kept very busy. When he wasn't directing or producing
plays, or acting in them, he was wading through bureaucratic red
tape and trying to rustle up city grants and federal loans. The
bulk of the current renovation was financed with a $500,000 federal
interest-free loan, a $225,000 loan from the city's Community
Redevelopment Agency, plus another $50,000 CRA loan and a $50,000
CRA grant to repair the building's facade.
</P>
<P>
   During a tour of the building, Cox pointed out various
unfinished odds and ends and recounted the last-minute challenges
facing his staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to put a transformer in at the last minute because the
electrician left us with no power,'' he said. ``You can see we're
about halfway to where we need to be.''
</P>
<P>
   If the American Renegade is still a work in progress, Cox gives
the impression of a man whose heaviest lifting is finally behind
him. One big reason for that is J.P. Luckenbach, 24, the energetic
new associate artistic director.
</P>
<P>
   An L.A. native whose mother ran a Hollywood-connected catering
business, and whose uncle has served as director of photography for
``Friends'' and ``Mad About You'' episodes, Luckenbach met Cox last
year while hunting for a theater for an independent production. The
two men quickly hit it off, especially when Cox discovered that
Luckenbach had experience in producing and in working with lights
and computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``J.P. has been like a saving grace,'' Cox said. ``He knows all
the things I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 99- and 45-seat theaters, the company's new
building houses a 21-seat teaching facility and rehearsal space; a
small reference library; a VIP lounge; another lounge for actors'
use; and a small office occupied by the Valley Theatre League, the
umbrella organization of area theater companies and producers.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the two main theaters has separate men's and women's
dressing rooms, and there is a lobby and bar area near the main
Magnolia Boulevard entrance.
</P>
<P>
   For its debut season, American Renegade is presenting three
plays on its mainstage. After ``The Sicilian Bachelor,'' which Cox
intends to run for ``as long as we can,'' the theater will present
``The Wait,'' a drama by company member John Goff. about the
traditions surrounding a Southern shrimp-boating family. ``The
Boat,'' a play about a Queens man going through midlife crisis,
will conclude the season.
</P>
<P>
   The mainstage also will host a Dec. 8 celebrity fund-raising
event and Toni Morrell's one-woman show, ``An American Dream, Or
What the Hell Was I Thinking,'' which opens Dec. 1. The mainstage
will operate under a standard 99-seat Equity contract, Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   At present there are few events scheduled after ``Theater Hell''
at the smaller venue. But one independent company is renting the
space to produce Lorraine Hansberry's ``A Raisin in the Sun'' next
year.
</P>
<P>
   The NoHo district should get a major boost this summer when the
MTA finally opens its subway station at Lankershim and Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   Says Luckenbach: ``It should be fabulous when we get the subway
stop open because there'll be a direct link between (NoHo) and the
two theater districts,'' downtown and in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Cox, a Long Island native who has been doing theater since
he was 19, said one of NoHo's major challenges is bringing in
visitors from the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to make people see visions,'' Cox said of the NoHo
district as a whole and the American Renegade in particular. ``We
get caught up in our little worlds. But if you keep that picture
alive ...''
</P>
<P>
   He let the thought trail off without bothering to add, ``You
won't have to go through theater hell.''

COMMENTARY: A KNICK REBORN 
</HEADLINE>
   (Public Interests)  
 (af)  
 By GAIL COLLINS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Let's hear it for the athlete as president!'' said John
McEnroe to the Bill Bradley rally at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   We had to get there eventually. Every American who lived through
high school has been programmed to regard the star player as a
superior species. What's amazing is that it's taken the athletes so
long to decide that, as natural winners, they ought to be running
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bill Bradley, hopefully, has been pretty selective in
terms of the celebrities that he has asked to jump on board,'' said
Bob Cousy, the former Celtic, in an interesting example of
celebrity snobbism. ``So the point is: If we're all pretty good
guys and we've lived our lives properly, then, hey, why don't you
listen to us in this case and vote for Bill Bradley?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, it might work for motor oil.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's early presidential campaign was a long lope away from
his years with the New York Knicks. I once asked him whether he
thought the NBA players' strike would be over in time to save the
season, and he said he didn't much care. Campaigning, he gave the
impression he'd gone directly from a small town on the Mississippi
River to the Senate Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But now he's getting back in touch with his inner jock. In the
process he's putting his long arm around thousands of male fans,
some of whom began to look like teenagers gawking at Ricky Martin.
A team of all-star Bradley supporters, led by the likes of Bill
Russell, blitzed the Sunday morning talk shows to extol his honesty
and team spirit, and left Tim Russert grinning like a pom-pom guy.
Who cares who has the best health care plan? The idea of being pals
with Walt Frazier and Julius Erving is beyond ultra-cool, far
better than eight years as anybody's vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he secretly likes it or not, being a basketball player
is Bradley's unique selling point, the thing that separates him
from the other serious, intelligent Democratic senators of the
world who got their letters in high school track. Kids today have
no idea who he was, but a whole lot of middle-aged white men grew
up watching him play, identifying with the way he compensated for a
lousy jump and lack of speed. Happily for Bradley, these are now
the exact same people who run Wall Street and make campaign
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   So there he was last weekend, helping his former teammates
re-create a moment from the last game of the 1970 NBA playoffs,
passing the ball to Willis Reed for the basket. (It was not exactly
a you-are-there experience. The candidate did his dribbling in a
blue suit.) Sitting on the sidelines, he listened to testimonials
from superstars of the past _ (italics)select(end italics)
superstars, of course, like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and John Havlicek.
(Al Gore, who should really stop competing in this game, announced
Monday that he had snagged the endorsement of Michael Jordan's
mother.)
</P>
<P>
   But the pro-Bradley testimonials were not particularly
convincing, unless you're one of those people who believe
professional athletics builds character. Lots of players said they
remembered Bradley, who was not the Knicks' leader, for his
leadership. Jerry Lucas talked about how he and the candidate used
to have ``audio codes that nobody understood but us,'' in a tone
that suggested they were in communication with alien messengers.
Bill Walton delivered his own personal brand of political analysis.
(``Freedom is so much more than telling kids it's all about smoking
and carrying AK-47s.'')
</P>
<P>
   Success in sports has actually been a shortcut into politics for
some time now _ it sometimes appeared that the entire House
Republican caucus consisted of former college quarterbacks. But a
basketball player-politician is pretty unusual, and perhaps
Bradley's experience playing in what was already becoming a black
sport has made him sensitive to racial issues. The fact that his
black fellow players feel that's true may be the only important
thing that we can learn from his sports career.
</P>
<P>
   My own favorite story was Frazier's description of how, when
they shared a room in the days before TV remote control, Bradley
would sit at the end of the bed hunched over the set, obsessively
changing channels. (``He never said, `Hey, Clyde, are you looking
at that?''') If being good at basketball signifies presidential
character, what does hogging the TV set mean?

 &HT;    MANY PARENTS WON'T SEND KIDS TO A BETTER SCHOOL
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Would you rather send your child to a good school
near your home, or a better school that is pretty difficult to get
to?
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-four percent of parents chose the better school and 40
percent chose the closest school in a national survey released
Tuesday by Public Agenda.
</P>
<P>
   That surprised the pollsters, who thought that even more parents
would choose the better school, said Steve Farkas, chief researcher
at the nonprofit polling organization in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   To find out why 40 percent of the 394 parents favored
convenience, they interviewed another 208 parents this summer in
areas where many parents already have a choice of schools. The
places were Cleveland and Milwaukee, which give some parents
vouchers for tuition in private schools, and Arizona and Michigan,
where many public charter schools compete with the regular public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turned out that academic excellence is not the only thing
that parents take into account when deciding where their children
should go to school,'' Farkas said.
</P>
<P>
   He said parents gave three main reasons for settling for second
best: the child's safety, the child's feelings, and the family's
convenience.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of parents wanted a school to be close enough to let them
``show up right away'' in an emergency, Farkas said.
</P>
<P>
   Black parents in Milwaukee were wary of suggestions that they
send their children to better schools outside the city. Some
worried that suburbanites might not make their children feel
``welcome and comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The third factor was simply a matter of convenience,'' Farkas
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If both parents commute, many are already stretched getting
everything together and everybody off to the right school and
job,'' he said. ``They hesitate to take the extra hour to get up
earlier so a student can go to another school that's far away.''

LINCOLN'S PARADOXICAL THANKSGIVING VISION ECHOES THE PSALMS

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ``In everything give thanks,'' St. Paul advised in his letter to
the Thessalonians in the Christian New Testament.
 &HT;    With a booming stock market, high employment, the frontier-like
energy of cyberspace and millennial optimism, it is easy to follow
Paul's dictum as we pause for our yearly Thanksgiving celebration.
 &HT;    There's that nagging Y2K computer glitch problem, but otherwise?
This Thanksgiving seems the harbinger of a prosperous new century.
 &HT;    Americans tend to equate Thanksgiving with material prosperity.
``Dear God,'' runs our national prayer, ``Thank you for everything
we have. And bless all those poor people who don't have as much as
we do. Amen.''
 &HT;    Paul's words, ``in everything give thanks,'' serve as a
discomforting reminder for our national celebration. ``Everything''
means giving thanks in all circumstances: good and bad, rich or
poor, health or illness, peace or war. In all things, give thanks
to God.
 &HT;    Although New Englanders have celebrated it since 1630,
Thanksgiving Day only became a national holiday in 1863 when, in
the midst of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln instituted it as a
yearly celebration.
 &HT;    In 1863 the war was a stalemate. Generals won battles and lost
them. The Union gained ground in the West; the Confederacy held
firm in the East. On both sides, troops deserted the army.
 &HT;    Civilians tired of the whole thing. In the summer of 1863,
antiwar riots broke out in Boston and Richmond. Even that year's
Emancipation Proclamation failed to rally expected popular and
political support. General Sherman urged Lincoln to turn the
conflict into total war: ``If need be, take every life, every acre
of land.''
 &HT;    In his annual message to Congress that year, Lincoln himself
showed the war's strain. Ill, lacking his usual insight, and
suffering from recurring nightmares, the president stated that
``Under the sharp discipline of civil war, the nation is beginning
a new life.'' But what new life? Lincoln did not say. It was too
dark for even the usually visionary president to see.
 &HT;    Although hope was obscured, Lincoln still issued his
Thanksgiving Day Proclamation echoing St. Paul's command: ``in
everything give thanks.'' Until World War II, there was no worse
season in American history than the fall of 1863. Give thanks? For
what? Political crises, death, uncertainty, war?
 &HT;    And to whom? Certainly God could not be thanked for such
suffering. America's traditional Protestant God seemed far away.
Countless citizens turned to alternative beliefs -- such as atheism
and spiritualism -- to try to answer the difficult questions raised
by the war.
 &HT;    Lincoln, mired in his own internal religious struggles,
nevertheless believed that human affairs unfolded under the rule of
God. God's will, however imperfectly understood or recognized, was
working itself out through the conflict.
 &HT;    Lincoln did not identify God's cause with that of the Union
Army. Instead, he understood himself as a sinful servant upon whom
God's judgment rested. The only ``side'' is God's. Human beings can
only approximate it.
 &HT;    Therefore, the North should not only give thanks for great
military victories. Rather, the nation should give thanks because,
however mysteriously, God's will was being accomplished through the
suffering. From evil, good. From death, life. Give thanks because
God is found in and through all things.
 &HT;    Lincoln's paradoxical Thanksgiving vision echoes that of the
Psalms in the Hebrew Bible. ``Give thanks to the Lord, for he is
good; for his steadfast love endures forever.'' The Psalms portray
the full range of human experience. Joy, anger, love, hatred, fear,
prosperity, suffering, victory, rage. But they consistently give
thanks to God for everything from God's gracious provision to God's
presence in the midst of evil. In everything, give thanks.
 &HT;    Thankfulness places us rightly before God. By thanking God in
all circumstances, we are reminded we are not ultimately in
control. When we have much, prosperity is a gift. When we have
little, we rest in God's comfort.
 &HT;    Thankfulness is an attitude of mind that keeps us from thinking
too highly of our achievements or thinking too little of our worth
as God's children. Thankfulness breeds the contentment that,
whatever the circumstance, God is with and for us.
 &HT;    This Thanksgiving, give thanks. Not because we invested in the
right stock. But because God is with us, even in the midst of our
prosperity. God has not abandoned America to material success but
is, mercifully and persistently, calling us to remember who we
really are.

 FACE TO FACE WITH THE STARS: A dermatologist sizes up  celebrities,
warts and all, on his Web site  
 By MICK LaSALLE  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Dermatologist Vail Reese has two passions _ skin
and the movies. The result: A Web site devoted to both.
</P>
<P>
   Skinema (www.skinema.com) is a 3-year-old site on which Reese
analyzes movies and movie stars in terms of skin, hair and nails.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always loved film,'' says Reese, 35, who as a youngster
studied at American Conservatory Theater's Young Conservatory and
considered becoming an actor.
</P>
<P>
   But his Web site, he says, is more than entertainment. It serves
a medical purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in residency,'' says Reese, ``doctors always used W.C.
Fields as an example of a condition called acne rosacea _ it's an
adult form of acne which is not caused by alcohol, though it can be
made worse by alcohol. Dermatologists would say, `If we're not
aggressive about treating this, you could end up looking like W.C.
Fields.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Naming an actor gives the patient an immediate visual memory _
you know, `A picture's worth a thousand words.' So I thought, why
not use actors to illustrate other skin conditions, which I see
routinely?''
</P>
<P>
   Reese, who has been in practice for five years, goes to the
movies regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has become a cliche in movies that skin conditions are used
to show evil characters,'' he says. ``Most of the time it's
scarring, sometimes albinism. When a movie has an evil character
suffering from albinism, my patients deal with the aftermath for
weeks _ they get extra stares. Part of the point of the Web site is
to educate people.''
</P>
<P>
   Skinema has no advertising and is done as a ``nonprofit hobby,''
says Reese. ``I'd rather keep it pure.''
</P>
<P>
   What follows is the skinny on Hollywood skin, according to
Reese:
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Madonna: &LR;  ``She has adult acne. So does Cameron Diaz and
Vanessa Williams. Patients who have adult acne feel better when I
let them know that stars like Madonna and Cameron Diaz have the
same condition.''
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Robert Redford: &LR;  ``Here is a classic example of the effect of
the sun _ furrows, wrinkles, discoloration. The bumps on Redford's
chin are protuberant flesh-colored nodules, moles that have grown
inward.''
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Matt Damon: &LR;  ``He has a lot of moles _ all over his neck and
back. You can see them in `Good Will Hunting' when he takes off his
shirt. They are not skin cancer, but having so many does increase
the risk of melanoma. He needs to have them checked regularly.''
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Minnie Driver and Julianne Moore: &LR;  ``Both are fair-skinned
actresses who have sun spots that are indications of sun damage.
Moore says she is wearing sunblock these days, which is a good
idea.''
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Winona Ryder: &LR;  ``Winona Ryder, Christina Ricci and Kate
Winslet are part of a new generation going for a fair look. There
is no question these women are considered attractive. Hopefully,
they signal a new generation's attitude toward sun exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is in contrast to people like George Hamilton and Warren
Beatty, who influenced a generation to have `a healthy tan,' which
is anything but healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; James Woods: &LR;  ``He has acne scarring, which you see in a lot
of male actors who are rugged types _ Tommy Lee Jones, Dennis
Farina, Ray Liotta. It is rarely seen in actresses, though
Elizabeth Hurley has some mild acne scarring that's mostly hidden
by makeup.''
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Jean-Claude Van Damme: &LR;  ``He has a bump on his right
forehead. It's most likely a lipoma _ a benign growth of fat cells.
One wonders why he hasn't had it removed. A little scar on his
forehead might fit more with his rugged image.''
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Catherine Zeta-Jones: &LR;  ``She has a vertical line-like scar on
her neck from a tracheotomy. As a child, she had severe pneumonia
and a tube was inserted into her windpipe to help her breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Michael Jackson: &LR;  ``Vitiligo is a condition in which the
immune system attacks the skin and removes color in patches. Skin
slowly fades over the years. What Jackson has does not appear to be
vitiligo, though it could be that he does have it and uses makeup
to even out the skin tone.''

   Many people think that the whole notion of preserved ancestral
dishes exists only in Europe. But it exists here, too. In Virginia,
the traditions can still be found in the hollows and foothills of
the back country.
</P>
<P>
   Hollows _ they're called hollers locally _ are not as big as
towns, but each one has a name and 6 to 12 families in residence.
Your hollow is your cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days, I had a young country girl working for me who
talked about what she cooked for her daddy up in her hollow. I was
fascinated by her descriptions. She had an uncanny sense of taste.
In fact her palate was better than those of many graduates of
culinary school. While she was happy to do cutting and chopping,
she would not do any cooking because, she said, she cooked only for
her daddy.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after several years, I succeeded in getting her to cook
lunch for me. She made her daddy's favorite soup in about 15
minutes, using only a paring knife and a stockpot. We christened it
Turnip Comfort.
</P>
<P>
   It is really a chowder, the deeply nourishing, satisfying kind
that warms you through and through. Little cubes of turnips and
potatoes give it a rugged texture, and the broth is similarly
sturdy and rich, even though its base is water, not stock. The
turnips have a hearty sweetness that melds so well with the potato
that the soup doesn't need stock; in fact, stock would probably
just muddy the flavors.
</P>
<P>
   You can make the soup a day in advance, but it is so quick it's
good for the last minute. Just cook some diced country bacon, which
gives the broth a deep, smoky note, and then sweat a little onion,
add the turnips and potatoes and cover it all with water. In a
remarkably short time, the flavors meld and the starch in the
potato naturally thickens the soup. Some torn-up collards provide
color, and a few drops of cream marry the flavors and add a little
luxury.
</P>
<P>
   The longer the soup cooks or rests, the thicker it will be;
eventually it will turn into a porridge. I prefer it cooked only
until the turnips and potatoes are spoon tender. But it depends on
how you like it. If you make it ahead and rewarm it, you'll have to
thin the broth with a few drops of water or cream to return it to a
chowder.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the taste of Turnip Comfort is reminiscent of an
earthy European peasant soup, the kind you just can't find anymore.
</P>

THE APPETITE WAITS FOR NO BIRD 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Probably the most challenging part of cooking Thanksgiving
dinner is deciding what to serve until the turkey is carved. You
need some kind of diversionary starter for everyone to nibble at
while the lumps are being mashed out of the potatoes and whisked
out of the gravy, but it can't be anything really rich or heavy or
filling, or no one will ever make it to the pumpkin pie.
</P>
<P>
   And it certainly can't be anything that takes more than a few
ingredients and a couple of steps to assemble on a day when even
the best cook feels overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   You could just go out and buy a few sneaky convenience foods,
but the flavors would seem off before a meal that celebrates real
home cooking. A better way to give the appearance of being a
generous and caring cook without becoming a galley slave is to
choose from some quick, simple and surprisingly different starters
based on ideas borrowed from classic hors d'oeuvres.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of these takes more than 15 minutes of work, most of
them far less. They are all familiar enough to serve to
unadventurous relatives on this all-American holiday, but each one
has a little twist.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps my favorite is real onion dip, ideally served with
potato chips but almost as good with calorie-deficient raw
vegetables. Ever since Lipton took over the supermarket aisle,
onion dip has been routinely made with powdered onion soup mix.
Even in cookbooks you find recipes like, ``Stir 3 tablespoons onion
soup mix into 1 cup sour cream.'' There had to be a way to make it
simple without opening up a packet full of mystery ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed to me that the original idea was to imitate the
dominant flavor of onion soup _ caramelized onions _ so I tried
doing exactly that. I minced some onions, cooked them in oil until
they were well browned and then stirred them into sour cream.
</P>
<P>
   It was a fresh, three-ingredient dip (if you count the oil,
which you drain), with clarity, intensity and complexity of flavor.
(You can make and serve this right away, but the onion taste
intensifies if you allow it to sit, refrigerated, for about a day.)
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, I decided I could improve on the standard recipe for
shrimp cocktail sauce, which I always found thin and uninspired.
Without departing too far from the original, made with Heinz chili
sauce, I came up with a richer, tastier cocktail sauce by borrowing
an idea from the famed French chef Joel Robuchon, who adds a little
butter.
</P>
<P>
   That not only makes the sauce cling to the shrimp better, but
makes it taste equally good warm or cold. (I like it warm, just as
a contrast to the cold shrimp.)
</P>
<P>
   Three other Thanksgiving tidbits I developed are even easier,
starting with marinated olives. All you have to do is toss a
variety of olives in olive oil, garlic and herbs; let them stand an
hour; then stand back while guests ask incredulously, ``What did
you do with these?''
</P>
<P>
   The addition of a fragrant, tangy lemon cut into segments makes
them even more special. But the real key is to use an assortment of
good olives, preferably the kind produced in France, Italy, Greece
or Spain and sold in bulk.
</P>
<P>
   If possible, include some oil-cured olives, which really come to
life when marinated. You can marinate the olives up to a week in
advance if you like.
</P>
<P>
   The unusually warm fall this year inspired another super-simple
appetizer. Fresh figs are still in produce markets _ and still
ripening in California _ and they can be halved and stuffed with
any creamy, flavorful cheese. Usually I rely on a good blue, but
creamy goat cheese, drizzled with balsamic vinegar, is more
crowd-pleasing.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I wanted a simple, light dipping sauce for raw
vegetables, so I warmed olive oil with garlic, freshened the mix
with uncooked olive oil, seasoned it with lots of salt and pepper
and spiked it with lemon rind. The flavors go great with fennel,
one of the easiest of vegetables to convert into crudites.
</P>
<P>
   Just trim the bulb by cutting off the bottom half-inch or so,
then stand it up on its flat end and slice downward to make thin
strips. Stack the slices and cut into dipping sticks.
</P>
<P>
   Or you could just open up a bag of baby carrots and serve them
with that homemade aromatic oil. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   FIGS STUFFED WITH GOAT CHEESE
</P>
<P>
   Time: 15 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 ounces, approximately, of soft, fresh goat cheese
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon good balsamic vinegar
</P>
<P>
   12 fresh figs, washed and drained. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Use fingers to roll the goat cheese into 24 small balls, each
{ inch or less in diameter. Place them on a plate, and drizzle with
vinegar. Shake gently to coat evenly.
</P>
<P>
   2. Cut figs in half. Press a cheese ball into the center of each
fig; as they are stuffed, return them, stuffed side up, to the
plate where the cheese was coated in vinegar. Serve within an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: about 12 servings. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   REAL SOUR CREAM ONION DIP
</P>
<P>
   Time: 15 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup neutral oil, like canola or grape seed
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Pinch salt
</P>
<P>
   \ teaspoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sour cream. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Place oil in an 8-inch skillet, and turn heat to medium-high.
When it's hot, a minute or two later, add onion, salt and sugar.
Cook, shaking pan occasionally, until onion browns, about 10
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   2. Pour onion and oil into a fine strainer; reserve oil in
refrigerator for another use. Stir onion into sour cream. If time
allows, cover and refrigerate for 24 hours. Serve with potato chips
or raw vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 servings. &QL;

crumbled dried leaves)
</P>
<P>
   1 lemon, cut in half and pulp removed as you would from a
grapefruit. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Toss together all ingredients in a bowl. Marinate at room

</P>
<P>
   Minced zest of 1 lemon
</P>
<P>
   1 fennel bulb. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. For the dipping sauce, combine half the olive oil and garlic
in a small saucepan and turn heat to medium-low. Cook, shaking pan

<P>
   COLD SHRIMP WITH WARM COCKTAIL SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3 pounds large shrimp, peeled and deveined if desired
</P>
<P>
   1 cup ketchup
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon vinegar
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons horseradish, or to taste. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Place the shrimp in a saucepan large enough to hold them
comfortably. Add enough cold water to cover them. Turn the heat to
high and bring the water to a boil. Cover the saucepan, remove it
from the heat and let the shrimp sit 10 minutes. Drain the shrimp
in a colander or through a sieve. Place in a large shallow bowl and
chill completely. (Or, if you're in a hurry, you can just run the
shrimp under cold running water to cool them off.)
</P>
<P>
   2. To make the sauce, combine the ketchup, the vinegar and the
butter in a small saucepan. Mix them well.
</P>
<P>
   3. Cook the sauce over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally,
until the butter is completely melted. (At this point, you can keep
the sauce warm for more than an hour, but keep the heat under it as
low as possible.) Add horseradish to taste.
</P>
<P>
   4. Serve the cold shrimp with the sauce, warm or cold.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: At least 10 servings.

CONCERNED ABOUT INFLATION, FED RAISES INTEREST RATES BY 0.25
PERCENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a
quarter of a percentage point Tuesday, saying that the combination
of strong growth and low unemployment had left the economy
vulnerable to an outbreak of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third time this year that the central bank has raised
rates to check the economy's momentum, and signaled that the Fed's
growing faith in technology to improve business efficiency and
temper inflationary pressures has its limits.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining its action, the Fed emphasized a concern that Alan
Greenspan, its chairman, has raised in recent months: that the
economy is literally running out of workers, and that pressure to
raise wages and then prices will inevitably mount.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed said it was raising its benchmark federal funds target
rate on overnight loans between banks to 5.5 percent from 5.25
percent. The move completed a process of reversing the three
quarter-point reductions in the Fed funds rate last year in
response to the financial crisis that spread from Asia to Russia
and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank also said it would increase its largely
symbolic discount rates on loans to financial institutions from the
Federal Reserve system to 5 percent from 4.75 percent. It was the
second quarter-point increase in the rate this year after two
quarter-point reductions last year.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in the Fed's official short-term rates quickly
began to ripple out into the longer-term rates paid by businesses
and consumers. Banks quickly began raising their prime lending rate
by a quarter of a point, to 8.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed said the cumulative effect of this year's rate increases
should ``markedly diminish the risk of inflation going forward,''
and that it had removed its formal policy of leaning toward further
rate increases in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Investors took the statement to mean that the Fed was likely to
hold rates steady at its next meeting, on Dec. 21, and probably for
at least a month or two into the new year.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had been sharply divided over whether the Fed would
tighten policy at its meeting Tuesday. And they said beforehand
that the outcome would go a long way toward defining the degree to
which the central bank believes huge business investments in
efficiency-enhancing computers and other technology can keep costs
under control and avert an inflationary buildup of wage and price
pressures.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed did not provide any details of its internal debate. But
its statement, issued shortly after 2:15 p.m., suggested that it is
by no means ready to abandon its traditional fear of inflation,
even though by most measures inflation remains hard to find even in
the face of persistently strong growth and historically low levels
of joblessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although cost pressures appear generally contained, risks to
sustainable growth persist,'' the Fed's statement said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite tentative evidence of slowing in certain
interest-sensitive sectors of the economy and of accelerating
productivity, the expansion of activity continues in excess of the
economy's growth potential,'' the statement said. ``As a
consequence, the pool of available workers willing to take jobs has
been drawn down further in recent months, a trend that must
eventually be contained if inflationary imbalances are to remain in
check and economic expansion continue.''

CHICKEN WITH ALL DARK MEAT  
 SAVING LIMA BEAN SKINS  
 SERVING YOGURT LIQUID 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MELISSA CLARK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I spotted a ``black chicken'' for sale in Chinatown that
looked dark purple. What is it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Black chicken (zook see gai), also known as silky chicken or
black-meat chicken, is a game bird weighing 1{ to 2 pounds that
originally comes from China. The skin of the bird ranges in color
from deep gray to inky purple to black, and the flesh beneath is
dark and flavorful. In the United States, black chickens are bred
in South Carolina and Pennsylvania and can be found for sale in
Chinese meat markets.
</P>
<P>
   Black chicken is believed by the Chinese to be extremely
healthful and is often made into soup. A recipe can be found in
``The Wisdom of the Chinese Kitchen'' by Grace Young (Simon and
Schuster, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you cook dried lima beans so that they stay whole
without shedding their skins?
</P>
<P>
   A: Beans that lose their skins usually do so when they are
overcooked. A simple remedy might be to pull the beans from the
heat a few minutes earlier than you usually do. Beans should be
cooked until they are just tender all the way through, but not at
all mushy. A trick to see if your beans are done is to remove a few
with a slotted spoon and blow on them. The skins should easily
break open.
</P>
<P>
   Another idea is to skip the presoaking step, and simply cook the
dried lima beans at a slow simmer until they are just tender. It
also helps to cook beans in plenty of water so that they have room
to float around without colliding, which can loosen the skins and
cause the beans to fall apart.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does the liquid that separates out at the top of a
refrigerated container of yogurt contain any nutrients? Should I
drain it off or stir it back in?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The liquid does contain traces of the same proteins, live
bacterial cultures and nutrients found in the solid part of yogurt.
If you want to get the most from your yogurt nutritionally, stir it
back in. This will also give the yogurt a little bit of a looser,
runnier consistency. Conversely, pouring off the liquid leaves a
slightly creamier yogurt. Taken several steps further, many recipes
call for purposely draining away much of the liquid, which gives
yogurt a thick, spreadable consistency. Since the amount of
nutrients in question is small, it's really a matter of taste
whether to stir or drain.

   Minimalism is sometimes a very good thing, especially when it
comes to the pecan pie. Anne Rosenzweig's version, which she serves
at the Lobster Club in Manhattan, is the perfect example: just a
crisp square of puff pastry topped with a thin layer of molten
caramel and toasted pecans. It's served hot, right out of the oven,
with a jaunty finish _ a little cube of vanilla ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   What Ms. Rosenzweig has done, of course, is reinvent the heavy
Southern classic as a golden, fragile tart. This fall, she took a
look at the traditional pie and decided that needed to be done.

   ``There are two things that are wrong with it,'' she said.
Namely, the crust and the filling. The pecans were faultless, of
course.
</P>
<P>
   So she eliminated the crust and the filling and came up with a
version so thin and light that it shatters in the mouth and proves
once again that less can be more.
</P>
<P>
   At the restaurant the tart is $7, but it can easily be made at
home.
</P>
<P>
   The components can even be put together a day in advance: put
the baked puff pastry in plastic wrap, and leave it overnight at
room temperature. Store the caramel sauce in a plastic squeeze
bottle in the refrigerator. The next day, put the bottle into a pot
of boiling water and heat it for 5 to 10 minutes _ just until the
syrup softens. Assemble the tart, and bake.
</P>
<P>
   To get cubes of ice cream, Ms. Rosenzweig recommends using a hot
knife to cut them from a block. Lay the little cubes on a cookie
sheet, and keep them frozen until you're ready to serve.

   CRACKLING THIN TART WITH PECANS AND STICKY CARAMEL
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from the Lobster Club
</P>
<P>
   Time: 40 minutes
</P>
<P>
   For the caramel sauce:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup light brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup light corn syrup
</P>
<P>
   { cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of salt
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   For the pastry and assembly:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 5-by-5-inch puff pastry squares
</P>
<P>
   3 cups pecan pieces.
</P>
<P>
   1. Prepare the caramel sauce: In a medium heavy saucepan,
combine light brown sugar, granulated sugar, corn syrup, heavy
cream and salt. Place over high heat, and bring to a boil. Boil for
10 minutes, then remove from heat and add butter. Stir well to mix,
and keep warm. (The sauce may be prepared a day ahead of time and
stored, refrigerated, in a squeeze bottle. Reheat by placing the
bottle in a pot of boiling water until softened and warm.)
</P>
<P>
   2. Prepare puff pastry: Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Place puff
pastry squares evenly spaced on parchment paper laid on a baking
sheet. Chill for 15 minutes. Cover with another sheet of parchment
paper, and weight with another baking sheet on top. Bake for 8
minutes, remove top baking sheet and top parchment paper, and
continue to bake until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from
oven. (The puff pastry may be baked a day in advance and stored,
sealed in plastic wrap, at room temperature.)
</P>
<P>
   3. To assemble: If necessary, reheat oven to 450 degrees. Pour
warm caramel sauce over pastry squares, and sprinkle an equal
number of pecans on each square. Bake tarts until caramel is bubbly
and pecans are toasted, about 4 minutes. Serve hot, unadorned or
with a square of ice cream on top.

A TIME FOR CHARDONNAY AND CHAUVINISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   According to the earliest accounts of the first Thanksgiving,
the meal included birds, corn, peas, roast venison and beer. Beer?
Apparently there was not yet a decent wine shop in all of
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   There are probably quite a few people who still drink beer with
their Thanksgiving dinner and, given some of the delicious beers on
the market now, it could make for a delightful partnership. But
beer is filling, and with the amount of food most of us are
expected to ingest on Thanksgiving, wine is a wiser and more
festive choice.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional Thanksgiving repast is neither a delicate meal
nor a sophisticated one; it does not blend subtle, fleeting tastes
and aromas. So it is not a time to bring out great white
Burgundies, for instance. A big Champagne, like Krug or Bollinger,
will hold its own quite well with turkey. But most people are
saving their Champagne for the New Year's Eve of all New Year's
Eves.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Thanksgiving is an American event whose centerpiece,
the turkey, goes back, oh, 40 million years or so. I guess that
makes it as indigenous as an American creature can be. In my
chauvinistic view, the bird _ and the rest of us _ deserve American
wines.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing domestic wines offers an unexpected bonus. White
Burgundy may be out, but California chardonnay, which for my money
is too overwhelming for most fowl, is the perfect match for turkey.
There are some restrained, elegant chardonnays around, though for
the most part California chardonnay is a big-bodied, robust white
wine full of up-front flavor and aroma. In other words, just right
for the less than subtle taste of a roast turkey filled with a
pungent dressing.
</P>
<P>
   For a rich, powerful chardonnay, I'd suggest Chalone Vineyards
1997, a big, buttery, complex wine from the Gavilan Mountains south
of San Francisco. It will hold its own in any company, including
game. Or if you are planning a venison dinner and you prefer a
white wine, this could be the one for you. (About $30.)
</P>
<P>
   A bit less strident, perhaps, but still assertive is Fess
Parker's American Tradition Reserve Chardonnay 1997, from the Santa
Ynez Valley north of Santa Barbara. The wine has plenty of extract,
a nice touch of oak, and a remarkably long finish. (About $20).
</P>
<P>
   For something completely different, there's Tablas Creek Blanc
1997, a muscular blend of three Rhone Valley grapes: marsanne,
viognier and roussanne. Tablas Creek is a relatively new winery
near Paso Robles, in San Luis Obispo County, started in 1990 by the
Perrin family of Chateau de Beaucastel in Chateauneuf-du-Pape.
While not a replica of a blockbuster Hermitage white, this white is
both elegant and intense. (About $27.)
</P>
<P>
   Most traditionalists will want a red wine with their
Thanksgiving dinner and, if they are also patriots, they will
probably call for zinfandel, the grape America has adopted as its
own. Ridge Vineyards in Santa Clara makes a variety of zinfandels
from grapes purchased all over California, the unifying factor
being what one wine guide calls the ``classic restraint'' of the
winemaker, Paul Draper. I take that to mean the wines are rich and
intense but less rough and rustic than so many other zinfandels.
Ridge's 1996 Sonoma Station Zinfandel has zinfandel fruitiness and
classic Ridge structure. (About $20.)
</P>
<P>
   Amador County, far to the east of the Napa Valley, produces some
of the best zinfandel grapes. Ravenswood, in Sonoma County, another
winery that made its name with zinfandel, uses Amador grapes for
one of its most enticing bottlings, Ravenswood Amador County. The
scent of blackberries fills the room once the bottle is opened; on
the palette, the flavors linger on and on. (About $15.)
</P>
<P>
   For most families, the best choice is a wine priced low enough
so that opening another bottle or three or four is not going to
precipitate a post-dinner economic crisis. (``That uncle of yours
can sure put it away!''). For many savvy wine drinkers, the choice
is Marietta Cellars Old Vine Red, a blend that lets the winemaker,
Chris Bilbro in Sonoma County, use whatever he thinks will produce
the kind of wine he wants to make. Zinfandel, carignane, syrah and
cabernet may find their way into this delicious, full-bodied wine.
Different vintages may be used, which is why the wine is identified
only by lot number. Currently for sale, if you can find this very
popular wine, is Lot No. 23. (About $12.)
</P>
<P>
   By this point, there are probably quite a few people muttering,
``Where's the merlot?'' For me, most merlot is too soft and
unstructured, without enough tannin, for a main course like turkey
_ unless it is bolstered with 30 percent cabernet sauvignon. Here
is one that sort of breaks the rules. Canoe Ridge from Washington
State has merlot's softer taste, but it has good body. (About $19.)
</P>
<P>
   Not too many years ago, it would have been difficult to create a
completely American wine selection for an important meal. No
longer. A Schramsberg Blanc de Blancs as an aperitif will match any
French Champagne in its price range. (About $25.)
</P>
<P>
   Then end the day not with Cognac or grappa but with a great
American drink, Laird's 12-year-old apple brandy. (About $50).
Thanksgiving became an official holiday in 1863; the Lairds began
making apple brandy in 1780. Did somebody say something about
tradition?

   If an award were given to the most underappreciated wines,
chenin blancs would be wearing gold. Those same bartenders who pour
chardonnay in their sleep might choke at a request for chenin
blanc, even if you used one of the grape's proper French names:
Vouvray, Savennieres or Montlouis. But chenin blanc just needs half
a chance to prove its charm.
</P>
<P>
   It is an amazingly versatile grape. It can be dry enough to
pucker your mouth, or voluptuously fruity or sweet enough to drink
for dessert. Because the grape is both high in acid and rich in
flavor, well-made wines go beautifully with all sorts of foods and
have the potential to age.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that so many chenin blancs are not well made,
resulting in cheap wines that are too sharp or sweet. This has
given a bad reputation to Vouvrays in particular. But if you can
find good examples you will be richly rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   Few white wines can match the power and subtlety in a great
Savennieres, and even fewer are better values. And chenin blancs
from Coteaux du Layon make sweet, luscious dessert wines when
infected with botrytis cinerea, the noble rot mold.
</P>
<P>
   The best chenin blancs come from the Loire, where the grape,
sometimes called pineau de la Loire, may have been cultivated as
far back as the ninth century. The Loire may have history on its
side, but when it comes to quantity, France is outdone as a chenin
blanc grower by both California and South Africa, where the grape
is often called steen. Chenin is also grown throughout Latin
America, where it's called pinot blanco.
</P>
<P>
   Because the grape is sturdy and relatively easy to grow, chenin
blanc is most often used in both South Africa and the United States
for blending to produce inexpensive mass-market white wines. When
chenin blanc wines are produced in California and South Africa,
though, they are generally pleasant, and often good values.
</P>
<P>
   These six wines give a hint of the grape's range.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Poniatowski, Vouvray Aigle Blanc, 1996: $17
</P>
<P>
   Dry and refreshing with a hint of sweetness. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Domaine Deletang Montlouis, Les Batisses, Demi-Sec, 1997: $17.

   Semisweet, with a wonderful range of fruit flavors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Domaine des Baumard, Savennieres, Clos du Papillon, 1996: $20
</P>
<P>
   A luscious dry wine with a touch of citrus.
</P>
<P>
   Yves Soulez, Chateau de la Genaiserie, Coteaux du Layon
St.-Aubin, 1995: $40 (500 ml.)
</P>
<P>
   An ultrasweet dessert wine with a honeyed texture. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pine Ridge, California, 1998: $11
</P>
<P>
   Tart, dry and and pleasant. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KWV, Steen, Western Cape, South Africa, 1997: $7
</P>
<P>
   A simple, appley wine. Very good value.

`RKO 281': ORSON WELLES GIVES THEM THE WILLIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Liev Schreiber is nervous, and who can blame him?
This 32-year-old actor, who plays Orson Welles in the Home Box
Office drama ``RKO 281,'' about the making of ``Citizen Kane,''
gained 25 pounds and spent weeks reading about Welles and watching
videos of his performances and interviews. Schreiber soon began to
walk and sound like him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was I scared about playing someone who is playing someone so
imprinted in our consciousness?'' Schreiber said. ``Every single
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Schreiber is not the only one uneasy about the response to the
film, which will be shown Sunday. It focuses on the almost
Shakespearean clash between Welles and William Randolph Hearst over
the creation of Welles' 1941 masterpiece, ``Citizen Kane,'' and
depicts a Hollywood of the 1930s shadowed by anti-Semitism, a
Hollywood where the confluence of wealth and power were used _ as
they still are _ as weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``What appealed to us about doing this movie was partly to
recapture the old Hollywood, the intrigues of power and money that
were part of that world and still have echoes today,'' said HBO
chairman and chief executive Jeffrey Bewkes. .
</P>
<P>
   The drama, which takes some fictional license, is based partly
on ``The Battle Over Citizen Kane,'' an acclaimed documentary from
the PBS series ``The American Experience.'' Welles, a 24-year-old
genius, and William Randolph Hearst, the 76-year-old media titan,
clashed over the 1941 movie's depiction of the character based on
Hearst as monstrous and lonely. (RKO 281 was the production number
assigned to the film by RKO studios.)
</P>
<P>
   The HBO movie, adapted by John Logan, who has written the
screenplays for two major films opening in the next few months,
Oliver Stone's ``Any Given Sunday'' and Ridley Scott's
``Gladiator,'' was initially offered to Hollywood studios with a
cast of well-known actors who had expressed interest in it: Edward
Norton as Welles, Marlon Brando as Hearst and Madonna as Marion
Davies, Hearst's mistress. Scott would have directed it.
</P>
<P>
   But studios passed over the project because they did not view it
as commercially viable. HBO quickly picked it up. Scott and his
brother, Tony Scott, also a director, are executive producers. The
HBO film's director, Benjamin Ross, previously made the independent
movie ``The Young Poisoner's Handbook.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Schreiber, who has the title role next month in the
New York Public Theater's new production of ``Hamlet,'' the cast of
the HBO drama includes James Cromwell as Hearst, Melanie Griffith
as Marion Davies, John Malkovich as Herman Mankiewicz, the
brilliant, but alcoholic, writer who helped Welles write ``Citizen
Kane,'' and Brenda Blethyn as Louella Parsons, the gossip columnist
used by Hearst to intimidate the studio chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the film asserts that Miss Parsons terrified and
blackmailed studio chiefs like Louis B. Mayer, Harry Cohn, Jack
Warner and Samuel Goldwyn by telling them that unless they crushed
the film and destroyed every print, she would spread the word that
Hollywood was dominated by Jews. At the same time Hedda Hopper,
another gossip columnist, said she would distribute photos of the
moguls in sexual situations. The studio moguls agreed _ except for
the RKO chief, George Schaefer (played by Roy Scheider).
</P>
<P>
   Logan, the screenwriter, said the details came from books about
Hearst and Welles. Logan said earlier drafts of the screenplay also
involved FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, who was close to Hearst and
Miss Hopper. Hoover's involvement was dropped from the final
script, Logan said, because it detracted from the main story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hoover was very active as well as Louella in terms of
procuring files that were derogatory,'' Logan said. ``And the
studio chiefs were terrified of the Jewish issue. They were
terrified that if America heard that mass entertainment was
controlled by Jews, the country would be horrified. So they caved
completely.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only the support of Schaefer, the RKO chief, who was a
Roman Catholic, that led to the release of the classic film after a
plea by Welles to the RKO board. ``Schaefer had given Welles this
incredible contract of total freedom and a lot of money,'' Logan
said. ``If Welles went down, it would have reflected poorly on
Schaefer. He truly believed in this mad kid.''
</P>
<P>
   What animates the documentary and the film based on it is the
notion that Welles and Hearst, as much as they loathed each other,
were quite similar in their grandeur, in their megalomaniacal
personalities, in their ambitions. ``They both had a tremendous
need to make contact with the common man,'' Schreiber said. ``And
they felt totally dissociated from common people. Both of them came
from very privileged families, both of them were separated from
their families at an early age and both had been told they could do
no wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps surprisingly, the film depicts Hearst and Marion Davies
somewhat sympathetically; they adored each other. Hearst is
portrayed as a driven if tormented figure. ``I was actually
surprised to find myself liking him,'' said Ross, the British
director. ``The challenge was to make a film about Orson Welles and
the artistic and visual legacy of `Kane' without being swamped by
it. The danger was to make a film and become overly enamored with
the subject matter. Welles had plenty of flaws too.''
</P>
<P>
   Why Welles' career and personal life seemed to slide after
``Citizen Kane'' and why Hollywood never trusted him again are only
hinted at in the drama.
</P>
<P>
   People were offended by the size of his achievement, Ross said.
``It shamed the studios. And his claims of artistic authority and
genius were offensive to the studios. Welles was a bad winner at
that stage of his life. And he carried his brilliance badly.''
</P>
<P>
   Schreiber said that in preparing to play Welles, he was struck
by the tragedy of his life. The actor grew obese and sold products
on television. ``There was a huge void he was trying to fill,''
Schreiber said. ``As he became a deeper and deeper artist, he
became aware of that void.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy to be touted as a genius when you're 8 years old
and internationally famous in your early 20s. Where do you go after
that? Living up to that mantle is an intense and very risky
endeavor.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing Hamlet, Welles said, reminded him of playing Kane.
``Amazing parallels,'' Schreiber said. ``Both seem to be
confronting the same issue: in the service of truth, what
sacrifices do we have to make?''

   Brussels sprouts have an image problem, but it's perplexing
considering their assets. They are not difficult to cook. They have
a long season, stretching through winter. And they are not
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   For any cook with an offbeat aesthetic, brussels sprouts are a
wonderful weird little vegetable. The round, bulbous heads grow
like buds on the neck of a thick hard trunk about two feet high.
They are like cabbages in miniature, with tightly wound ruffled
leaves, and they have a pleasantly assertive, sweet and cabbagey
flavor. They are lovely when blanched and rolled in browned butter,
tossed with chestnuts or scented with bacon.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees, of course. Few people have mixed feelings
about brussels sprouts. They either love them or hate them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only place on the planet I eat brussels sprouts,''
said Raliegh Neal, a manager at the Grange Hall in New York's
Greenwich Village, when I ordered them. It is not that Kevin
Johnson, the chef, performs miracles on them. He just cooks them
properly.
</P>
<P>
   And that is often the problem with brussels sprouts. These are
not forgiving vegetables, and in the hands of an inexperienced
cook, they can turn to mush.

   There are two simple rules for success with brussels sprouts.
First, never buy any that are larger than a small plum. (It is best
to buy them at a farmers' market, where they are freshest, because
they are often sold on the trunk. But bring a shopping cart; they
are not easy to transport.)
</P>
<P>
   Second, don't overcook them. It may sound obvious, but the
perpetrators are many. Brussels sprouts are not like red cabbage.
They don't improve with long, slow cooking. They just get smellier.
</P>
<P>
   Most brussels sprouts recipes involve two techniques: blanching
and sauteing. Blanching removes the raw, green flavor, sets the
color and cooks, but not all the way through. Sauteing brings on a
richer, deeper flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking the sprouts whole is challenging. Cookbooks will tell
you that you need to cut a small ``X'' in each base. It's a fine
task if you're a surgeon, but it's about as much fun as pushing
fish mousse for quenelles through a sieve. If you must cook them
whole, press the point of a knife into the base; an entire ``X'' is
not necessary.
</P>
<P>
   It's simpler to cut them in half or quarters so they can be
braised,  &UR; quickly &LR; , without blanching first. Or you can always just
slice them, as Bill Schutz, the chef at Waterloo Brasserie in
Greenwich Village, does. In a dish with chanterelles, the sliced
sprouts are a bright accent. They are full-flavored and alive, and
they crunch in your mouth. The chanterelles melt. What makes these
seemingly disparate ingredients fuse is a creamy, smoky sauce
scented with maple syrup and bacon.
</P>
<P>
   When brussels sprouts are left almost whole, they are delicious,
too. At Babbo, chef Mario Batali serves them like jewels, on a
plate set on a starched napkin. They are browned on the edges, with
every layer of their cut halves caramelized. Crisp pancetta adds
crunch and salt; thyme and parsley, sprinkled in as the sprouts are
finished, are the first things you smell.
</P>
<P>
   The brussels sprouts and carrots with almonds served at the
Grange Hall are as unpretentious as home cooking. In fact, Johnson
doesn't even bother to peel the carrots. The dish is an ecstatic
jumble of colors and shapes _ green bulbs, angular sticks of carrot
and toasted almond slices. Each bite is sweet and nutty and
wonderful. But then brussels sprouts are lovely with nut flavors.
An easy way to get that taste is to saute blanched and quartered
brussels sprouts in butter and add a little walnut or hazelnut oil
at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking brussels sprouts shouldn't be a project. They have very
direct flavor and texture. All they need is a little coaxing, light
cooking and the absence of doubt.

A HOME FOR THE BARONESS' ART? YES, NEXT TO THE BARON'S 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain _ Some people become art collectors by birth,
which was certainly the case with Baron Hans Heinrich von
Thyssen-Bornemisza, whose grandfather collected Rodin sculptures
and whose father built up an impressive collection of Italian
primitives and Renaissance oils. The Baron then added richly to
what he inherited, so that the 800 paintings on permanent display
at the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum here since 1992 cover the 13th to
20th centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Others become collectors by marriage, which is what happened to
Carmen ``Tita'' Cervera, the former Spanish beauty queen who in
1985 became the baron's fifth wife. Thanks to gifts from her
multimillionaire husband and purchases of her own, her collection
has grown to some 600 works. And now it too is to have its own home
in two large buildings adjacent to the existing Thyssen-Bornemisza
Museum, itself just a stone's throw from the Prado Museum.
</P>
<P>
   The new deal is not unlike that made by the baron in 1988 when
the Spanish government agreed to spend $45 million on preparing the
late 18th-century Villahermosa Palace to display paintings he was
lending for 10 years. Spain then bought the collection for $350
million in 1993. Now the government is to spend $40 million
renovating space for the baroness' collection, which will initially
be on loan for 11 years, although an eventual sale or donation is
also in the cards.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Baroness Thyssen-Bornemisza (pronounced TEESS-ahn
boar-nuh-MEES-uh) has well and truly made her mark here. She was
instrumental in bringing her husband's collection to Spain from
Switzerland when several other countries were eager to receive it.
And now, she says with only a touch of irony, it is ``patriotism''
that has prompted her to settle her collection here. No wonder that
King Juan Carlos awarded her Spain's Gold Medal of the Arts in
March.
</P>
<P>
   Her collection includes works by Corot, Monet, Gauguin, Pissarro
and Sisley, although it cannot be compared in quality to that of
the baron, who filled important holes in Spain's own museum
collections with his Impressionist, Post-Impressionist, American
and modern paintings. Nonetheless, the baroness has built up a fine
collection of European landscape paintings and has gone out of her
way to buy Spanish _ and Catalan _ art of the 19th and early 20th
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``To save my husband's collection, I too became a collector,''
she explained recently. ``And luckily I understand art. I would
have done it anyway for my husband, but I love collecting. I
believe that museums of private collections are often more
beautiful than official museums because you choose your paintings
more carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for all her passion for her husband and their collections,
the baroness, now 56, has also learned it is not easy to be the
fifth wife of an extremely wealthy man 22 years her senior who has
four children from earlier marriages. Notably, complications have
arisen since the baron decided to include her and Borja, her son
from a previous relationship, among his heirs. So, in the way
things often happen when money is up for grabs, she is involved in
a messy family battle.
</P>
<P>
   A court case in Bermuda is pitting the baron against his oldest
son, Georg Heinrich, 49, for control of the Thyssen-Bornemisza
Group, an industrial giant worth around $2 billion. The baron ceded
control of the group to Georg in 1983 in exchange for an annual
payment, but he now claims to have been hoodwinked and wants to
annul the 1983 agreement. Unsurprisingly, Georg is resisting, and
the court battle in Bermuda, which is the group's legal residence,
could go on for years.
</P>
<P>
   Since the baron suffered a stroke two years ago, the baroness
has emerged as his spokeswoman and chief strategist. In a recent
conversation in the boardroom at the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, she
seemed as keen to defend her husband's position in the dispute as
she was to talk about art. ``I told my husband that everyone sees a
dollar sign on his face and they all end up with dollar signs on
their own faces,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her critics, of course, see just such a sign on her face. And
they blame her for the rift between the baron and Georg, who have
not spoken to each other for three years. Certainly, if the baron
resumes control over the Thyssen-Bornemisza Group, he will be free
to bequeath a share in the group to the baroness and Borja, his
adopted son, as well as to his four other children, Francesca,
Lorne, Alexander and Georg. For the baroness, though, the dispute
stems from Georg's refusal to pay his father his due. ``These have
been terrible years for my husband,'' she said. ``They have
destroyed his health.''
</P>
<P>
   Family tensions had already surfaced when the baron decided to
transfer much of his art collection from his Villa Favorita in
Lugano, Switzerland, to the new museum in Madrid. ``His idea was
always to keep the collection together,'' the baroness said.
Eventually, the baron's four children and his wife each created
trusts with his or her one-fifth share of the $350 million paid by
Spain for the collection, with the balance of his enormous
collection again distributed among the five. And it was at this
point, with some 200 paintings to her name, that the baroness
decided to become a collector in her own right.
</P>
<P>
   She said that it was during her earlier marriage to actor Lex
Barker that she became interested in art, thanks to his collection
of turn-of-the-century American painting. But when she first
visited the Villa Favorita, she recalled, ``I couldn't believe what
I saw.'' Subsequently she joined the baron when he went shopping
for art. ``He said he always bought through intuition,'' she said.
``He said I had the same intuition.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last three years, under the guidance of Tomas Lorens,
the chief curator of the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, parts of the
baroness' collection have traveled widely, from the new Shanghai
Museum to the Frick Collection in New York. In the basement of the
museum here, through Jan. 16, she has placed 65 of her paintings in
a show called ``Painting Nature: Genre and Landscape Paintings from
Bruegel to van Gogh.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum extension, which will house most of the Carmen
Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection beginning in October 2002, will be
linked to the Villahermosa Palace at three levels and will include
temporary exhibition galleries more spacious than the present
basement. There is evidently no need to change the museum's name
since the baroness is already present: in the museum's large
atrium, she and her husband preside in life-size paintings. The
only other portraits in the space are of King Juan Carlos and Queen
Sofia of Spain.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the flickering candlelight at Coup in New York City, the slab
of grilled meat could have easily been a pork chop or a veal chop.
It was on the bone, after all, about an inch thick, a great
15-ounce portion.
</P>
<P>
   But I hadn't ordered veal, or pork, or even steak. This was
something else entirely, something altogether improbable and a
little bit bizarre.
</P>
<P>
   They call it a turkey chop.
</P>
<P>
   I dug in, more convinced than ever that I was about to eat
anything but turkey. The meat was firm but moist, seared with a
perfect pattern of grill marks. Another bite. Mild flavor, in the
manner of veal. And another. The turkey chop may be the most novel
thing on the menu, but in the end, there was no mistaking: it was
turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, this was not just another pallid little cutlet. Somehow,
the tasteless, dry bird had been transformed into a meaty, tender
cut that you would eat happily rather than because it was
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   It was time to put on my investigative reporter's apron and
speak to the chef, Kevin Roth. He agreed to share his secret with
me, even though he had asked his butcher not to cut anyone else's
turkey the way he was cutting it for Coup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this will help me to become famous,'' Roth said. ``I
sure hope so. You want to be different from other chefs, and
hopefully it will set me apart.''
</P>
<P>
   When I found out soon after that a chef in Boston, Todd English
of Olives, was also serving turkey chops (a trend in the making!),
Roth was a bit chagrined.
</P>
<P>
   Worse still, English said he had created his version in the
1980s, long before Roth. English was also happy to share his chop
information and, in fact, had already put his recipe and butchering
directions on the Web site of the National Turkey Federation
(www.turkeyfed.org).
</P>
<P>
   ``I was butchering veal, and there was a turkey next to it.''
English said. ``If you split a turkey breast down the breast plate,
it looks similar to a veal loin.''
</P>
<P>
   English confessed that he had created his version as a joke. ``I
tell people it's from a new bird they've invented with four legs,''
he said. He often takes the chops home and cooks them on his grill.
</P>
<P>
   English's turkey chop is different: it resembles a pork loin
chop with the bone in the middle. Roth's chop has bones down the
side, and looks like a veal chop.
</P>
<P>
   But how do they carve these things? I dug deeper. I clicked on
the turkey Web site and found English talking and cutting away. I
downloaded the instructions and called Lobel's, the butcher shop on
Madison Avenue. Evan Lobel, one of the partners, had never heard of
such a thing, and was mystified by my description. Still, he agreed
to give it a try.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning I joined him for a butchering session. Even for
an experienced butcher, it was not so easy. Lobel was dissatisfied
with the chops from the first half of the breast. So, he made some
adjustments, like trimming off the ends first, leaving on more
skin, removing less bone. Eureka! Perfect turkey chops.
</P>
<P>
   First, Lobel cut the turkey breast down the middle and removed
the keel bone for the rib cage and breast. (Do not attempt this at
home unless you have a band saw.) Then the chops were cut about two
inches thick against the grain of the meat. (Band saw again.)
</P>
<P>
   Cutting across the grain is one of the two key differences
between a roasted turkey breast and turkey chops. It changes the
texture completely. But English's chops are not like Roth's,
because after English cuts the chops, he then joins the ends
together and ties them with butcher's twine.
</P>
<P>
   My investigation was almost complete. I tried the chops at
Olives, which were even more tender and juicier than the ones at
Coup.
</P>
<P>
   And I made them for myself _ and that is when I learned the
final secret to a flavorful, juicy piece of turkey: brining the
meat for 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   I believe English when he says, ``We actually have turkey chop
junkies who come just for them.''
</P>
<P>
   You, too, can make turkey chops at home and flabbergast your
guests, but first you've got some obstacles to overcome. You have
to be willing to spend more for turkey chops than you would for
veal, because there is a lot of waste. (Turkey enchiladas, anyone?)
You may have to buy the whole turkey, and if you are feeding more
than two people, you will certainly have to buy the whole turkey
breast.
</P>
<P>
   If you live in New York City, you can place an order with
Lobel's (by phone at 212-737-1373, or through its Web site,
www.lobels.com), for $16.98 a pound. Saturday is the deadline for
Thanksgiving orders.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can take the directions and pictures from the turkey
federation's Web site to you butcher, and throw yourself on his
mercy. &QL;

CARNEGIE INTERNATIONAL ART REVIEW: SAFE AMONG SEAMLESS SHADOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ The latest Carnegie International at the Carnegie
Museum of Art here confirms what was evident at the Venice Biennale
last summer: the norm for the big, international survey has become
a kind of institutionalized, make-nice subversiveness, often
expressed in installation-art form that catches the viewer briefly
in its headlights through some combination of political
correctness, environmental scale and/or dazzling technological
effects. But the thrill is always finite, comprehensible and either
fun or morally uplifting, digestible and quickly gone.
</P>
<P>
   The Carnegie International attempts to depart from this norm. It
is not as completely overrun as the Venice show with installations
and video. Neither is it top-heavy with photography, like Documenta
X in Kassel, Germany, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Most wondrous of all, the show, which has been organized by
Madeleine Grynsztejn, the Carnegie's curator of contemporary art,
has given a lot of space to painting. It is the first of these
shows in a several years to acknowledge painting as part of the
conversation in the new global art world. It also includes artists
who aren't (at least yet) part of the pool of usual suspects that,
while larger and more diverse in the newly global art world, tends
to dominate these affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all this, the latest Carnegie International (on view
through March 26) still feels surprisingly safe, predictable and
familiar, like so many shows of this kind. You would think their
organizers do little except fly around the world studying one
another's exhibitions. The theme here is the way artists deal with
our increasingly complex reality, but what you end up thinking
about is the seamless, unreal, strangely defanged shadow art world
that shows like this conjure up.
</P>
<P>
   You know there's trouble when the two works that make the
strongest impression only indirectly reflect the healthiness of
contemporary art. One is an installation piece made four years ago
by an artist who died two years ago. The other is a 19-minute film
so complex, compressed and resonant that it has the impact of a
feature and should probably be nominated for some kind of Academy
Award. Both these works have what is lacking in much of this show:
a touch of divine madness that is visually complex and free of
seductive packaging or political cant.
</P>
<P>
   The installation piece is by the German multimedia maverick
Martin Kippenberger, who died in 1997 at 43. Titled ``The Happy
Ending of Franz Kafka's `Amerika''' and inspired by that novel's
final scene in an employment office, it is a big, colorful sprawl
of mismatched, often altered desks and chairs that sits on a big
swath of bright green AstroTurf, marked like a soccer field.
</P>
<P>
   The piece occupies the museum's pride of place, its grand
columned atrium, where it evokes a riotous, energetically hand-made
painting as well as an office full of lunatic bureaucrats, so
vividly do the chairs conjure different personalities and
contretemps. One hopes that were the artist still alive, he would
have gotten the $10,000 Carnegie Prize, which is awarded by a jury
to one of the artists in the show. It went instead to William
Kentridge, a South African maker of beautiful if earnest animated
films.
</P>
<P>
   Almost equally strong is ``QM I Think I Will Call Her QM,'' a
surrealistic short film by Ann-Sofi Siden, 37, an underground
filmmaker and installation artist from Sweden. Like a
well-constructed short story (that Kafka could have written), it
portrays the disintegration of a mentally unstable psychiatrist
brilliantly played by Kathleen Chalfant.
</P>
<P>
   This woman spends her days in a squalid Greenwich Village
brownstone cursing her colleagues and neighbors and observing on
closed-circuit television a giant lizard in the shape of a woman
that she keeps locked in a small dungeonlike bedroom. Ms. Siden,
who calls the film ``a moving picture photo-play'' and directed it
with Tony Gerger, plays the lizard, slithering convincingly around
on the floor, covered to the eyelashes with dry scalelike mud.
</P>
<P>
   Her film is fascinating from an art world viewpoint because it
so deftly weaves together elements of performance, video and
installation art. The psychiatrist does things like block the
windows of the woman's home with tall stacks of books; her
second-floor office may be the best installation piece in a film
since the apartment that Gene Hackman destroyed stick by stick at
the end of ``The Conversation.'') ``QM'' is stronger than the video
installation that Ms. Siden showed at Venice last summer, but what
it is doing in an art exhibition is not quite clear.
</P>
<P>
   There are other isolated moments of madness in this show:
Matthew Barney's extravagant film ``Cremaster 2,'' with its
rhythmic sweeps of landscape, fetishistic interiors and opaque
narrative (definitely not a Hollywood feature); an installation
piece by a young German artist named Gregor Schneider that consists
of a creepy four-room fragment (Lecteresque basement included) from
his home in Rheydt, Germany, which he has been obsessively
subdividing into ever smaller rooms and passages since 1985; Kara
Walker's scathing silhouetted vaudevillian vignettes of antebellum
race relations; and Suchan Kinoshita's plywood shanties, 17 of
them, which line the museum's grand staircase. Each shanty is
outfitted with used furniture and some kind of surprising visual
experience, often scruffy little installation pieces situated on
the roof and visible through a mirror.
</P>
<P>
   In addition there is ``Ville Fantome,'' a tabletop city by the
Congolese artist Bodys Isek Kingelez that recycles bright plastics
and other materials into a carnivalesque array, similar to the
Kippenberger in its energy, that slyly mocks modern architecture
and imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   As might be expected, several of the big-show newcomers are
painters. Among them are the Americans Alex Katz, Ed Ruscha, John
Currin and Laura Owens, the Briton Chris Ofili, of ``Sensation''
fame, and the German Franz Akermann, represented by 79 maplike
watercolors.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For the most part these artists make the show look good and less
routine, although they are often at a disadvantage. Three of Katz's
four paintings are spread around the museum's stone-gray lobby;
upstairs, the paintings of other artists don't always fare so well
in the museum's arctic white-on-white galleries or get lost in the
shuffle of bigger, noisier works.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem with these big shows may be architectural.
Museum structures, built (or renovated) to accommodate large works
of art, seem to encourage bigness because it is assumed that only
bulk, or the darkness of video art, can contend with so much space.
Despite Ms. Grynstejn's efforts, the show's main accomplishment may
be the clarity with which it reveals the disturbing ways shows of
this type are affecting contemporary art.
</P>
<P>
   A prime example of the comprehensible finiteness that
characterizes the works here is ``Poetic Justice,'' a video
installation by Kendall Geers, a young South African, that bombards
the viewer with howling and brief video images of torture from
three commercial movies (including Mel Gibson in ``Conspiracy
Theory'') with his eyes taped open). The effect is briefly
horrifying and clearly on the side of right, but the images quickly
become routine, like extra-short movie trailers. Add to this the
inescapable impression that one is looking at a dumbed-down version
of Bruce Nauman's ``Clown Torture.''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem in this show and elsewhere is the exhaustion
factor, reflected in the abundance of artists who have appeared in
as many as six shows of this type and aren't represented by their
best work here. This includes Diana Thater, Kerry James Marshall,
Pierre Huyghe, Sam Taylor-Wood and Shirin Neshat. Ms. Neshat has
recently produced a streak of lyrically vehement video
installations that confront the separation of the sexes in
traditional Islamic culture with dramatic images of anonymous
groups of Muslim men and women and traditional music.
</P>
<P>
   But with ``Soliloquy'' Ms. Neshat presents a vague narrative,
starring herself, that seems to center on a woman torn between two
religions and includes stunning shots of the artist in imposing
architectural settings, one in Turkey, one in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Resuming the tiresome and simplistic narcissism that
characterized her early work, she stares meaningfully into the
camera for minutes on end and in one scene portentously washes
Persian script off her face and hands. This work exemplifies what
happens when political correctness combines with a big budget and
high production values: an initially powerful formula is repeated
to decreasing effect.
</P>
<P>
   Even outstanding works can be dogged by the familiarity that
builds when artists jet from one show to another to create the same
engaging effects. Sarah Sze's new installation, a combination of
two separate pieces titled ``Second Means of Egress'' and
``Seamless,'' is one of the show's crazier moments: a meandering
network of matchsticks, Q-tips and other modest materials and small
objects that climbs upward, loops across the ceiling, penetrates
the opposite wall through a scattering of incisions, and subsides
in a vaporizer gently blowing steam through a scroll of metal
screening. This combined work is better and certainly bigger than
the one Ms. Sze she did at Venice last summer, but ultimately it
isn't all that different.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most striking juxtapositions of the show is also one
of its more telling: a face-off between Currin's enigmatic
paintings of ivory-skinned nudes and Ernesto Neto's gauzy
ivory-colored installation, a long tunnel made of stretchy
semitranslucent fabric. With their Mona Lisa smiles, dark Northern
Renaissance backgrounds, curvaceous yet oddly chaste bodies,
challenging gazes and confusing gestures (15th-century Madonna
here, 1940s pinup there) Currin's beautifully made paintings resist
easy interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   Neto's tunnel is an undeniably sexy ``body'' of another species.
It features pink puckered holes on the outside and soft dangling
polyp-shaped bags of plastic-foam pellets on the inside. Attendants
invite you to take off your shoes, step inside, walk around a bit
and pat and push the hanging bags, an entirely pleasurable
experience. When you emerge, you may have enjoyed yourself and feel
refreshed. But Currin's nudes are still there, smiling, teasing,
refusing to be deciphered.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: It's all about Monet
 &HT;    (Eds: Third in a series from Paris.)
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIVERNY, France _ I came to see Claude Monet's home and gardens.
Claude wasn't home. He hasn't been for quite a while.
</P>
<P>
   One of the fathers of Impressionism, he died in 1926, well into
his 80s. Just as well. His eyes were gone by then and he could no
longer paint.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he cared so much about painting. The world, which cares
very much about his painting, may be surprised to hear such.
</P>
<P>
   But I have it on good authority _ in Claude's own words. To wit:
</P>
<P>
   ``Nous causerons jardinage, comme vous le dites, car pour l'art
et lat litterature, ciest la blague. Il n'y a que la terre.''
</P>
<P>
   Hard to argue with that.
</P>
<P>
   For the half-dozen or so readers who don't read French, it is to
say ...
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll talk about gardening ... because art and literature,
they're a joke. The only thing that matters is the earth.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to dirt, dirt in the garden.
</P>
<P>
   Monet painted to make a living, as much as $2,000 a canvas
toward the end of his career. These days, of course, his paintings
are worth all the money there is, and then some. Too bad for poor
old Monet. He could have had one heck of a garden, and then some.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, he didn't do so badly with Giverny. That's pronounced
``gee-ver-nee'' and loosely translated as, ``Gee, Vern. Neat.''
Maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   Monet came to this village in Normandy, northwest of Paris, in
1893, the same year he married his mistress, Alice Hoschede.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Hoschede was his second wife, the ugly one. The pretty
wife was Camille, who had died in 1879. She was the one you see in
his paintings. But you won't see her in any family photos. Alice
Hoschede tore them all up after she had the run of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Be it noted that Monet never painted any pictures of Alice
Hoschede. Probably he was doing her a favor.
</P>
<P>
   Here at Giverny, Monet concentrated on the flowers, especially
water lilies, the subject of his most famous paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Monet accumulated some 2 1/2 acres for house and garden,
orchards and lawns. A second parcel, acquired later, was where he
dug the ponds and established his water garden.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he dug the ponds himself. Not that he maintained the
gardens himself.
</P>
<P>
   Monet had a staff of seven gardeners, which is probably why he
preferred gardening to painting. The painting he had to do himself.
</P>
<P>
   Today a highway cuts through the property. Visitors _ 400,000
annually from April to October _ have to walk through a tunnel to
tour the water garden. The Japanese bridge is there, just as it is
in his paintings, though it's been reconstructed.
</P>
<P>
   Most everything about Monet's home and gardens were restored
after World War II, thanks mainly to some $14 million donated by
Americans, especially the Reader's Digest-Lila Wallace Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Each year Reader's Digest sends three American artists here to
paint. That's in keeping with a longtime tradition. There had been
an American colony of painters here since the turn of the century,
sometimes, it is said, driving Monet to distraction.
</P>
<P>
   Monet enjoyed his solitude. He liked to eat and drink, sit and
smoke. I don't think he liked to paint. Many of his paintings he
destroyed, more so toward the end of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Don't go looking for any that survived here at Giverny. His
heirs sold them all years ago. Better to visit the Museum d'Orsay
in Paris, which boasts the world's best collection of Monet's work.
</P>
<P>
   But who needs art? Give me good ol' dirt any ol' day.
</P>
<P>
   I like this place. I like what I know about Monet, that he was
stout and wore a long gray beard, handsome qualities in any man.
</P>
<P>
   I like to think I could have been Monet _ except for the
painting, of course, not to mention Alice Hoschede.

`VOYAGE TO THE NORTH STAR': A BOAT THAT'S `ALL WRONG' 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: pubication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carl Schenck is the sort of very rich guy who expects to get his
way, and we know from the very first line of Peter Nichols'
fogbound and tempest-tossed novel of maritime adventure what will
happen if he doesn't: ``On his first and only Kenya safari in 1932,
Carl Schenck was attacked by his white hunter after he
machine-gunned the heads off three loping giraffes from the open
cab of the safari truck.'' There is more than a little
foreshadowing here of the lethal sort of heedlessness that we will
see later as Nichols' first novel, ``Voyage to the North Star,''
unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   And a fiercely eventful novel it is too, an old-fashioned
adventure yarn given an impetuous, accident-prone propulsion by
Schenck, who does stupid and reckless things and assumes,
correctly, that his money will save him. The novel does not take
place on an African safari, Nichols' opening lines being all we
hear of that continent. Instead, Nichols takes us on a journey by
luxury yacht from a Gatsbyesque compound off New York's Long Island
to the barren coastline of Baffin Island, north of Labrador, where
his protagonist goes to hunt seals and polar bears.
</P>
<P>
   It is in moving from one terrain to the other, from
Depression-era New York to the coast of Arctic Canada, that
Nichols' story takes on its major themes, consciously derived from
those of Conrad and Melville. He depicts a theatrical cast of
characters morally adrift on a barren shore where some of them are
tempted to escape the normal constraints on human behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols does not write with the grandeur or the intellectual
originality of either of these great forerunners in the genre of
seaborne adventure. Nonetheless, his story pulses with action that
is given an extra measure of verisimilitude by his deep knowledge
of boats and the sea and the watery landscapes of the Far North.
</P>
<P>
   The story's main figure in many ways is not Schenck, but another
character, Will Boden, whom we first meet as a day laborer chipping
the paint off rusting hulls in New York Harbor. It is the
Depression, when jobs are hard to get and the rich are being
ruined, but we soon learn that Boden has been ruined in a different
way. He is a child of privilege who decided to go to sea, but a
seizure of mistaken judgment lost him his boat, and when that
happened, he lost his livelihood and a good deal of self-respect as
well. He has lost so much, in fact, that he doesn't have much else
to lose, and that gives him a kind of manly independence.
</P>
<P>
   Boden goes to work for Schenck, who seems to be getting richer
all the time even as other tycoons are falling into suicidal
bankruptcy. His first job is to drive an experimental speedboat
from New York to Florida for Schenck, who has teamed up with the
flier Eddie Rickenbacker in a scheme to manufacture passenger boats
that can beat the train from Pennsylvania Station to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   But Schenck, whose hero is Theodore Roosevelt, is soon
distracted by a yearning to gain fame as a hunter and explorer of
the north. He buys a 225-foot luxury yacht and hires a crew to take
him, his comfort-addicted wife and his moody daughter to the
Arctic. The boat, unsuitable for far northern conditions, already
has a captain, a former British naval officer named Percival, who
is very conscious of his rank. Schenck asks Boden to go as
navigator, but Boden refuses, showing his good sense:
</P>
<P>
   ``The boat's all wrong,'' he tells one of his friends, providing
a bit more foreshadowing. ``The skipper doesn't know where he's
going. Schenck's a madman. It's going to be a holy disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   But Boden goes anyway, as a coal stoker. Nichols tries to make
sense of this decision. He brushes in the death of Boden's mother
and his estranged wife's announcement that she has found somebody
else, an aging writer who dyes his hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking about killing myself,'' Boden tells his friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then this is for you,'' the friend replies of Schenck's
venture.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Nichols introduces others into this journey. One
is a handsome Ivy League youth, Gar Chamberlain, a former lover of
Schenck's daughter, Harriet. His father has just lost all his money
in the crash, prompting Gar to want to learn practical seafaring
skills. Harriet herself is sweet and spoiled in what would normally
be a harmless way _ but not in the territory where Nichols has
taken her.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is a young physical culture addict named Joey,
silent, sinister and slavishly devoted to Schenck. The story has
encounters with icebergs, polar bears and snowstorms. But it is a
small band of Eskimos, depicted by Nichols with marvelously earthy
exactitude, who emerge at the center of what is finally a tale of
moral transgression.
</P>
<P>
   Any sea venture, whether ``Moby-Dick'' or ``Voyage to the North
Star,'' depends on technical authenticity, and Nichols does not
fail in this regard. This is a writer who knows the difference
between a lead line and an air baffle, civil twilight and nautical
twilight, and he writes about boats and icy seascapes with poetic
pleasure. He has taken the trouble to learn about the Eskimo
language and the multiculture of Northern trading posts. Not the
least of the enjoyment of this novel of faraway regions comes from
the sense that the author has been there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voyage to the North Star'' does threaten in places to
overheat, and some of its characters straddle the vague border
between the tragic and the merely ludicrous. But at the center of
the story is a believable greed for power, which becomes
indistinguishable from evil, and when the reckoning for that evil
takes place, Nichols' novel provides a chilling Conradian dose of
ironic justice.
</P>
<P>
   In all, ``Voyage to the North Star'' is a tough-minded, exciting
debut for a writer who combines a powerful sense of elemental place
with a keen awareness of the elemental human flaws.

   Like casserole dishes, pie pans are equipment that few cooks put
much thought into choosing. Many use what was handed down to them,
or they buy something pretty, or they cheap out and go for an
aluminum pan from the grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   But these are not prudent decisions, for the pie pan is as
crucial to the finished pie as the dough. Different materials hold
heat differently, and different designs affect the way the pie
cooks. If the fit is wrong, the pie will suffer for it.
</P>
<P>
   Because a pie is served in its pan, it ought to be one that you
want to look at. And considering the effort it takes to make a pie,
you should get it right.
</P>
<P>
   A great variety of materials are available: glass, aluminum,
stoneware, nonstick and ceramic. And even more designs. Some are
deep, some are shallow. Some have wide rims, some have none. To
determine the best, I tested eight kinds, using the pumpkin pie
recipe from ``The Pie and Pastry Bible'' by Rose Levy Beranbaum
(Scribner, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO METALLIC makes a shallow aluminum pan, perforated on the
bottom. I thought the holes would help the crust bake dry on the
bottom. But that proved to be misguided optimism. The pumpkin
filling cooked through before the dough did, producing a gummy,
white, half-cooked dough and a filling on the verge of cracking.
Two 9-inch pans are $5.49 at Zabar's, 2245 Broadway (80th Street),
New York City, (212) 787-2000.
</P>
<P>
   A PYREX pie pan, similar in form to the Chicago Metallic, was
also disappointing. Again, the pan did not get hot enough to cook
the pastry before the filling. And with a wet filling like pumpkin,
which tends to weep liquid after baking, the pastry should be
completely cooked through. The 9-inch Pyrex is $3.95 at A Cook's
Companion, 152 Atlantic Avenue (near Clinton Street), Brooklyn,
N.Y., (718) 852-6901.
</P>
<P>
   A great bargain, by contrast, is the 8}-inch PROGRESSIVE
INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION nonstick pie pan, which is $2.98 at
Zabar's. It held heat well and baked evenly, producing a pumpkin
pie with a browned crust, still tender from the butter. But the
nonstick coating displayed other problems, not to mention having no
esthetic appeal. While slices were easy to remove from the pan, the
surface was so slippery that part of the crust's border simply slid
off the pie while it was baking. Next time, I would form the border
closer to the inside of the rim.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was ROSE'S PERFECT PIE PAN. Rose is Ms. Beranbaum,
the cookbook author. Her 8-inch, shallow, wide-lip ceramic pan is
made by Mudworks Pottery. It's a beautiful dish and has a recipe
printed on the bottom for her delicious cream cheese pastry. The
pan also works well. The pastry was as brown as almond skin and not
at all doughy, and the wide rim made the pan easy to transport to
and from the oven. It was not, however, perfect for pumpkin pie. A
dish this shallow seems better suited for double-crusted pies with
fruits, like apples, mounded high in the center. Ms. Beranbaum's
kind of perfection does not come cheap: the pan is $38.95 at A
Cook's Companion.
</P>
<P>
   EMILE HENRY produces classic-looking Burgundy-clay pie pans.
They come in bright, happy colors, and some have fluted rims, so
even if your pie doesn't look great, what's cradling it does. The
one I tried, a 9-inch pan, had just a single flaw: the sides of the
crust cooked quicker than the bottom. It's a problem easily solved
by baking the pie closer to the bottom of the oven or on top of a
baking stone. It's $24.95 at Broadway Panhandler, 477 Broome Street
(Wooster Street), (212) 966-3434.
</P>
<P>
   Another attractive pie pan with the same problem is the heavy
CLAY CITY POTTERY pan. An 8-inch pan is $17.50 at Broadway
Panhandler. Like Rose's pan, it has a good wide rim for lifting,
and the rim is unglazed, which prevented the pastry from weeping
into the pan. But the pan left the center less cooked than the
sides.
</P>
<P>
   The best pan was the 9{-inch CHANTAL deep-dish stoneware pan. It
has an odd design, with ridged sides that have a softer slope than
the Emile Henry and no real lip. Though it is made for thicker
pies, like double-crusted peach pies, it worked well with pumpkin
pie. I made a border for the crust on the ridge below the rim,
which provided a perfect shield from the oven heat (crusts often
brown too much before the interior of the pie finishes baking) and
allowed the pumpkin filling to puff up and bake to a soft
puddinglike texture without cracking. The gentle slope of the sides
also made it easy to lift out slices. More important, though, the
pie baked evenly. The entire crust was a deep golden brown like
bread crust and crisp but tender. This pan is $12.98 at Zabar's.
</P>
<P>
   I could not leave out grocery store aluminum foil pans.
Typically, they come three to a pack for about $2. They are so
cheap for a reason: they are incredibly flimsy. Getting the pie
with its loose filling into the oven was a near disaster: the pan
almost folded in half. The very bottom layer of the pastry cooked,
but not the rest, giving it a cardboard texture. Pie pans, even Ms.
Beranbaum's luxury version, just aren't that expensive. You might
as well splurge.

`LIBERTY HEIGHTS': ROCK 'N' ROLL AND PREJUDICE IN EVER MISTY
BALTIMORE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
(jt) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Baltimore has been awfully good to Barry Levinson. Whenever this
gifted filmmaker seems in danger of succumbing to Hollywood's
schlockiest temptations, he dips back into the personal memory bank
of his Baltimore boyhood and comes up with something sweet and
heartfelt. In ``Liberty Heights,'' his fourth Baltimore-based film,
Levinson pores over the social traumas and cultural trivia of 1950s
America as reflected in his native city with the concentration of a
diehard nostalgist minutely inspecting the still-visible scars of
his own hypersensitive adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   In remembering the virulent anti-Semitism and racism of
Baltimore in the mid-1950s, this warmly sentimental, sometimes very
funny film subscribes to the notion propagated by countless other
movies, television shows and rock 'n' roll histories that America
was more or less born in the mid-1950s; before that were the dark
ages. And in a way it's true. With the rise of television, rock 'n'
roll and the teenage car culture, the shell of America's devouring
pop fun house was already in place by 1954, the year ``Liberty
Heights'' begins.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious problems facing any movie revisiting such familiar
territory are finding a fresh point of view and coming up with
characters who transcend the pre-``Happy Days'' teenage stereotypes
we know too well. The strategy of ``Liberty Heights'' is to build
an atmosphere that is so intensely true to the period that you
can't help but dream its dreams and be caught up in its tensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Liberty Heights'' remembers this era through the eyes of two
brothers, teenage Ben (Ben Foster) and the slightly older Van
(Adrien Brody), growing up in a middle-class Jewish family in the
mostly Jewish northwest section of Baltimore. The most irritating
symbol of their uncertain status in a gentile-dominated world is a
country club with a posted sign at the entrance reading ``No Jews,
dogs or coloreds allowed.'' The boys' father, Nate (Joe Mantegna),
runs a discreet numbers racket and operates a burlesque house with
two partners. And some of the movie's wittiest moments recreate
pieces of vintage burlesque skits. Their mother, Ada (Bebe
Neuwirth), is tight-lipped, puritanical and devoted to her husband.
A meddlesome but good-hearted grandmother is also on the premises.
</P>
<P>
   Much as Levinson's 1982 film ``Diner'' did, ``Liberty Heights''
focuses on the boys' fumbling rites of passage, but here the time
is two or three years earlier. Again, Levinson shows a special
knack for capturing the boastful, clinging camaraderie and cultural
fetishes of innocents trying to invent themselves in a more
restrictive era. Masking their anxiety in foolish braggadocio and
speculation, they swap apocryphal sexual lore while pining after
forbiddingly unattainable goddesses.
</P>
<P>
   Ben develops a crush on Sylvia (Rebekah Johnson), a sensible,
well-mannered middle-class black girl in his high school, and the
pair sneak out on a chaste date in which she instructs him to
huddle below the front seat of the car so they won't be seen
together. Van pines for Dubbie (Carolyn Murphy), a haughty
horseback-riding debutante he meets at a Halloween party where she
is dressed as a fairy princess waving a wand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Liberty Heights'' is a leisurely paced series of anecdotes
that jump from character to character to create the sense of a
society in accelerating flux. The most dramatic sequence crosscuts
from a James Brown concert at which Ben discovers the thrill of
soul music to a high-toned teenage society bash attended by an
anxious Van searching for his dream girl.
</P>
<P>
   The movie has some lovely comic touches. Ben, whose voice-over
narration frames the story, is astounded to discover the existence
of a gentile world where people consume bread that isn't toasted.
In another scene, a friend of Van's, visiting an elegant WASP manor
with lavishly furnished antiques and expensive rugs, naively
assumes that a family that can't afford wall-to-wall carpeting and
Formica tables must be poor or very stingy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Liberty Heights'' pointedly compares anti-Semitism with the
far more severe prejudice against blacks, who are shunned by WASPS
and Jews alike in mid-1950s Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   In the most serious plot turn, Nate and his partners come up
with a promising new twist on their numbers racket, which backfires
when Little Melvin (Orlando Jones), a black drug dealer who has
placed 50-to-1 odds on a number that carries a bonus, unexpectedly
wins $100,000. Lacking the money to pay the prize, Nate is forced
to bargain with Little Melvin, with disastrous consequences for
Nate and his family.
</P>
<P>
   But because ``Liberty Heights'' looks back through Ben's and
Van's youthful eyes, even the harshest turn of events wears a misty
nostalgic glow. The family dynamics remain unexplored, as do the
darker aspects of Nate's profession. Mantegna's Nate is a model
father, husband and breadwinner who just happens to be operating
outside the law. His sons are just as lovingly drawn. Foster's Ben
is a likable all-American boy who even when rebelling (one
Halloween he dresses up like Hitler) is essentially sweet-natured
and pliable. Brody's Van is surprisingly soft-edged, given the
hopped-up energy that the actor effuses almost like perspiration.
</P>
<P>
   But if ``Liberty Heights'' is much too soft at its center, it
still offers a deeper immersion in that old '50s feeling than any
other Hollywood film in recent memory. As its inviting period
soundtrack fills in the background and its youthful characters
lurch through their pseudo-sophisticated rituals of rebellion and
desire, the gawky sincerity of an earlier era comes stumbling back,
a little tipsy and poignantly alive.
</P>

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   The unusually dry weather pattern of recent weeks will persist
over a large area from the Rockies to the East Coast Wednesday, but
a frontal system moving into the interior West will signal the
beginning of a gradual shift to moister conditions in much of the
nation over the next several days. Despite the shifting pattern, no
major storms or Arctic chill will invade the nation through the end
of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Variable clouds and showers will move east with a cold front
through Nevada and Idaho toward the west slopes of the Rockies. In
the wake of the front, snow levels will gradually sink below 6,000
feet late in the day and at night. Farther west, drier air will
cause clouds to break near the Pacific Northwest coast.
</P>
<P>
   Unseasonably mild conditions and plentiful sunshine will prevail
from the Rockies to the Plains states. Breezes from the southwest
will increase during the afternoon as low pressure begins to
strengthen over the interior West. Showery rain will develop
Wednesday night near the west slopes of the Rockies. By early
Thursday, the showers will change to snow over the higher
elevations of the northern Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Expansive high pressure will keep the East dry with ample
sunshine. The chill will begin to moderate over the Northeastern
states as northwesterly winds diminish, but afternoon temperatures
will stay several degrees below the seasonal average.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Lenny, with its highest winds near 110 mph, will
produce torrential rain as its center moves about 100 miles south
of Puerto Rico toward the northern Leeward Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Backward Hurricane
</P>
<P>
   Compared to a typical tropical cyclone in the Caribbean, the
eastbound Hurricane Lenny has been moving backward. Normally,
systems in the Tropics are embedded in a current of easterly winds
that carry them toward the west. The tropical easterlies result
from the circulation that forms between a broad belt of low
pressure near the equator and a high pressure zone that girdles the
globe around 30 degrees north latitude. Occasionally, especially
late in the season, the prevailing westerly winds of the middle
latitudes can penetrate south, shifting the tropical windflow into
reverse.

`BLACK AND BLUE': A BATTERED WIFE RUNS AWAY, AND THE DETECTIVE
FOLLOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: producton notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By RON WERTHEIMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Black and Blue,'' as blunt as its title, feels as immediate as
a jab in the gut. Like the bully it portrays, it knocks you to the
floor and leaves you there, stunned. You're in pain, all right, but
you haven't gone very far.
</P>
<P>
   The film, on CBS on Wednesday night, is the grim story of a
battered wife who flees Long Island with her 10-year-old son. She
covers a lot of miles, but she hasn't really gone very far either.
</P>
<P>
   You never doubt that her husband, a New York City police
detective, will track her down, even though her escape has been
choreographed by a shadowy organization that helps such victims
disappear into new identities. While you wait nervously for the
ill-tempered cop to turn up, you wonder about him and his wife,
bound so tightly by pain and regret. But they never progress from
symbols into three-dimensional people. You want to care, at least
about her, but you can only watch as the melodrama stalls this side
of tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the more fully realized novel by Anna Quindlen, ``Black
and Blue'' revolves around Fran Benedetto: nurse, loving mother to
10-year-old Robert and punching bag to her husband, Bobby. As
played by Mary Stuart Masterson, Fran is a suffering Madonna, more
icon than person. She is goodness incarnate, just as Bobby (Anthony
LaPaglia) is evil on the hoof. After he beats his wife savagely,
and she demands that he look at her bruises, Bobby sneers, ``What
are you gonna do, Frannie, call the cops?''
</P>
<P>
   These familiar actors have explored these poles before; you can
make out echoes of other performances here. But this film, written
by April Smith and directed by Paul Shapiro, strains the dedication
of both the actors and the viewer. It tells you that Fran and Bobby
were once bound by a love that has fermented into a volatile, toxic
brew. Everything she does, everything she is, just enrages him.
You're left to wonder how they could ever have stood each other.
</P>
<P>
   The other cast members must cope with one-note roles as well.
Sam Robards is all caring sunshine as the schoolteacher who finds a
place in his heart for both Robert and Fran. Joanne Merlin is all
malevolent darkness as Bobby's mother who eggs him on to vengeance
with lines like ``You gonna let a snotty little Irish girl get
you?''
</P>
<P>
   The one performance with any depth comes from Will Rothhaar, the
boy who plays Robert. He locates the stifling ambivalence that
makes him hate his mother's humiliation and still love his father.
This is no lovable tyke. His character's sarcasm, which seems to
come as naturally as breathing, is a constant reminder that as long
as Fran keeps the boy with her, she is never really rid of Bobby.
</P>
<P>
   In the film's cleverest moment, Robert refuses to hide his
disgust for the dumpy apartment to which his mother has taken him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is it?'' he demands. ``This is Florida?''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is  &UR; part &LR;  of Florida,'' Fran says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's the pool?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The other part.''
</P>
<P>
   But this lightness quickly evaporates, and the film is left to
sink.
</P>
<P>
   All concerned are to be commended for confronting a serious
subject without a hint of sugar coating. But this drama could have
had the resonance of a contemporary tragedy. Instead, it's more
like a bellyache.

   MONEYTALK _ Financial planning books are on the rise for several
reasons. One is that more and more Americans have investments. One
recent study showed that 52 percent of American households own
stocks or stock mutual funds. Another reason is that we feel more
responsible for building our own financial future and less
confident we can do it. In another study, 45 percent of men and 53
percent of women said they worry about having enough money for the
future. But most of them are sound, and some of them are very good.

TOM AMMIANO WINS KEY ENDORSEMENT FOR S.F. MAYOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund, a major financial
supporter of homosexual candidates for state and local offices,
endorsed Tom Ammiano Tuesday for mayor of San Francisco in the Dec.
14 runoff against incumbent Willie Brown, a longtime supporter of
gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   If Ammiano, 58, wins, he will be the first openly gay chief
executive of a major U.S. city.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Bond, the Victory Fund's executive director, said that
while Brown, 65, has been ``a tremendously fair-minded leader''
with a strong gay rights track record, ``our mission to elect great
openly gay and lesbian public servants is clear, even when they are
not running against anti-gay extremists.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond added, ``We must open up the political process wherever we
can until sexual orientation is no longer a barrier to public
service.''
</P>
<P>
   In explaining the selection between two pro-gay candidates, Bond
invoked the name of Harvey Milk, the gay San Francisco supervisor
gunned down in 1978 along with Frank Moscone, the city's mayor at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting Milk, Bond said, ``It is not enough to have friends
represent us, no matter how good those friends may be. We must give
people the chance to judge us by our own leaders and our own
legislators.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond said both mayoral candidates have such strong gay rights
records that he doesn't anticipate gay and lesbian public policy
issues becoming a major factor in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, formerly the Democratic speaker of the state assembly in
Sacramento, is the city's first black mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano, president of San Francisco's board of supervisors,
waged a successful write-in candidacy on a shoestring budget of
$25,000, placing second after Brown in the Nov. 2 mayoral election
and ahead of former San Francisco Mayor Frank Jordan and a dozen
other candidates. Ammiano won 25 percent of the vote to Brown's 39
percent. By holding Brown to less than 50 percent of the vote,
Ammiano forced the run-off.
</P>
<P>
   The victory fund, which endorsed Ammiano in two previous
campaigns for city supervisor, cited his work as a ``driving
force'' behind the city's domestic partnership legislation that
requires city contractors to offer domestic partners of employees
the same benefits offered to the spouses of married workers. The
fund also cited his campaign promises to bring more affordable
housing and jobs to downtrodden neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano has also been endorsed by the San Francisco Probation
Officers Association and the San Francisco Tenants Union.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has won endorsements from the city's Republican Party and
the San Francisco Apartment Association, the city's largest
landlord group.
</P>
<P>
   The Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund has generated more than $2
million for gay and lesbian candidates.

BUSH URGES TEXAS OFFICIALS TO FOCUS ON STATE BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PEGGY FIKAC  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush took a break from his
pursuit of the Republican presidential nomination on Tuesday to
encourage appointed representatives of Texas agencies to focus on
their state duties despite other demands on their time.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you know, I'm spending a fair amount of time out of the
state these days,'' Bush told about 200 people he has named to
various commissions and boards, the second such seminar he has
addressed this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm focused on Texas, though. I mean, I'm still the
governor,'' he said. ``And I've got a lot of work to do as the
governor, which I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush likened his balancing act between his job as governor and
courting voters to the demands of daily life experienced by those
on state panels.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have your families, you live in communities, you've got
your own businesses to run or your jobs to do, but you need to be
focused on this job, too,'' he said. ``So my first admonition is:
take your responsibility as seriously as I take mine. It's a big
deal to serve Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor encouraged the appointees to focus on a small
number of goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always felt government ought to do a few things and do
them well,'' he said. ``I know that if there are so many goals,
there end up being no goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said politics did not come into play in choosing the
appointed board members that oversee state agencies. ``We didn't
ask the question how capable are these people from a political
perspective. We asked the question how capable are these folks for
serving the state of Texas,'' he said.

TV NOTES: ABC'S `MILLIONAIRE'; NBC SCHEDULE CHANGES; COMEDY
CENTRAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   How to Milk A Money Cow  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The only remaining questions about the runaway ratings train
called ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' are: How big can it get?
and What does ABC do with it next?
</P>
<P>
   The answer to the first question seems to be: As big as anything
on television in decades. As for the second question, ABC is doing
what any producer does with a hit: extending its run. The network
announced Tuesday that it would add three editions of
``Millionaire'' this month.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of ``Millionaire'' on the November sweep ratings has
been nothing short of tidal. The show has laid waste to just about
everything in its path, plowing through nights like Sherman going
through Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Only two shows have been able even to hold their own against
``Millionaire'' this month, NBC's ``Friends'' on Thursday night and
Fox's ``X-Files'' on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ABC is all but certain to win the ratings race on the strength
of the night-after-night winning numbers put up by ``Millionaire,''
and the decision to add more nights is an effort to insure that
victory.
</P>
<P>
   The latest run of ``Millionaire'' was scheduled to end Sunday
night, giving ABC 15 nights of a sweep rating stunt. Now ABC is
moving programming around to accommodate editions of
``Millionaire'' next Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday nights. Each of
those shows will be on at 8 and be an hour long.
</P>
<P>
   With ABC already comfortably ahead of NBC and CBS in terms of
total viewers and NBC in terms of the young adult viewers that
those networks use as their main measuring stick, that should
easily be enough to guarantee ABC's first sweep ratings victory
since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Longer term, ABC still faces the difficult decision of how to
maximize the advantage it now has with the ``Millionaire''
phenomenon. That may mean adding the show to its weekly schedule
once or twice a week.
</P>
<P>
   But some industry executives suggest that ABC may be compelled,
even if it goes to a regular prime-time edition, to add an edition
of the show as a syndicated entry. The show could then replace
``Jeopardy'' if that syndicated game show ever moves away from its
home on the local stations owned by ABC. ``Millionaire'' also would
probably become a billionaire in terms of the profits it could make
for ABC in syndication.
</P>
<P>
   ABC executives do not expect to address the ultimate plan for
``Millionaire'' until the latest run of shows is over.
</P>
<P>
   NBC Rolls the Marbles
</P>
<P>
   NBC has announced broad changes in its prime-time schedule for
every night except Wednesday and Thursday, all to take place in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Most significant are the moves of several dramas. The promising
new ``Law and Order'' spinoff, ``Special Victims Unit,'' will move
from Monday at 9 to Friday at 10, giving its creator, Dick Wolf,
the 10 p.m. time period he coveted for that decidedly adult show.
</P>
<P>
   Another new drama that NBC is very high on, ``Third Watch,''
moves to Monday at 10, the spot that Wolf most coveted but was told
he could not have last spring.
</P>
<P>
   That was because it belonged to the NBC news magazine
``Dateline.'' But NBC has been persuaded to move ``Dateline'' after
all.
</P>
<P>
   Neal Shapiro, the executive producer of ``Dateline NBC,'' said
Tuesday that he was comfortable with the Monday move now because in
January ``Dateline'' would not have to face ``Monday Night
Football'' at 9 and mainly because in all the changes NBC left all
five weekly editions of ``Dateline'' on the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best news for us,'' Shapiro said, ``is that we move our
Sunday show from 7 to 8 p.m.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sundays many NBA basketball games on NBC last until 8 p.m.,
which is the rest of the reason.
</P>
<P>
   NBC will also try to find more viewers for its best-reviewed new
show this season, ``Freaks and Geeks,'' by moving it from the
obscurity of Saturday at 8 p.m. to a more accessible time, Monday
at 8 p.m. That displaces two comedies that viewers seem to be
aggressively avoiding, ``Suddenly Susan,'' which is being shelved
for now, and ``Veronica's Closet,'' which is, to the surprise of
many, once again being handed one of NBC's best comedy spots,
Tuesday at 9:30.
</P>
<P>
   The one new show being added by NBC is ``The Others,'' a
supernatural thriller, which is getting the Saturday at 10 slot. To
make room, ``The Pretender'' moves to 8 and ``Profiler'' to 9.
</P>
<P>
   New Cable Executive
</P>
<P>
   The Comedy Central cable channel reached a long way to find a
new creative executive for the network _ all the way to England.
</P>
<P>
   The channel yesterday named Bill Hilary, a program executive
with the BBC in London, to the new job of general manager. He will
be responsible for all programming, marketing, advertising and
promotion for the channel.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment was made by Comedy Central president Larry
Divney, , who will shift his own duties to building a business
strategy for expanding the channel.
</P>
<P>
   Hilary has had a long career in British television, most
recently as the head of the BBC's Independent Commissioning Group,
which was responsible for developing programming for that network.
Previously he worked for Channel 4 and Granada Television, mainly
developing programs for young audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the appointment of Hilary, Comedy Central announced
the departure of Eileen Katz, the channel's executive vice
president for programming, saying she had decided to leave the
company. Hilary will be assuming the programming duties previously
held by Ms. Katz.

CONSIDER THE SCRAMBLED POSSIBILITIES

   It's one thing to grow up and have your parents never stop
reminding you how they sacrificed so you could have straight teeth,
a university education and an elaborate wedding. But what if they'd
spent $150,000 on a beautiful egg from a fashion model donor just
so you would be physically gorgeous?
</P>
<P>
   Can you imagine the stress on a child who was created only for
his ideal looks? What happens the first time he falls down and goes
boom on that perfectly sculpted nose?
</P>
<P>
   If you were the result of a genetic mating based on physical
perfection, would you also get to be just a scruffy little kid?
Would you be permitted to bruise, get a pimple, freckle from the
sun? Would your parents ever stop staring at you?
</P>
<P>
   You wonder about these wannabe parents who would buy the eggs of
a fashion model off the Web from a photographer and horse breeder
just so they can get the prettiest baby. Maybe they'd do better to
save their money and buy a Lexus. Then if they didn't like its
looks after all, they could trade it in on an Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   Who would consider doing baby business, anyhow, with an egg
broker who says things like, ``It's the butterfly that's the
prettiest that gets the guys.''
</P>
<P>
   A baby bred just for looks will not get to be cute just because
he's a baby. That kid better come out smiling and ready for video,
with a dimple in his chin and eyelashes to die for. He better have
them fainting in the delivery room and running into the sides of
buildings when he goes by in his stroller.
</P>
<P>
   The designer child made from a fashion model egg or fashion
model sperm (the same egg man promises soon to have handsome sperm
for sale) will not get to have baby fat. Or appear in public with
mashed bananas on his expensive face. He will have to have
Hollywood hair, not little baby tufts, and that skin better be free
of diaper rash.
</P>
<P>
   Pity the poor designer kid when she goes to preschool, forbidden
to mess up her looks with fingerpaint and mud. Who will play with
her if she can't get dirty?
</P>
<P>
   What happens to the kid if she grows a weak chin or her teeth
come in crooked? You have to watch it with these models, you know.
They are not always what they seem. Their cheeks can be filled out
with collagen, their stomachs smoothed by liposuction. Maybe
they've had the bottom they were born with hoisted and that amazing
little waist came from having a couple ribs removed.
</P>
<P>
   Eggs don't lie and some may come with the ``before'' flaws. What
if beautiful baby has allergies that make her eyes run and her nose
get all red during pollen season? Most parents learn to cope with
what they get, but how will those who paid big money for physical
perfection adjust to not getting the look they ordered? Will they
sue?
</P>
<P>
   And what will happen when perfect child becomes perfect
teen-ager and wails that his pecs are too small and her hair not
curly enough and it's all the parents' faults for not placing an
exact order. It would seem unfair for designer parents to tell
their children, ``Nobody's perfect,'' or ``Beauty is only skin
deep.''
</P>
<P>
   This whole idea of going for the perfect 10 child is scary,
silly and easy to mock, but let us trust that Mother Nature, with
her wonderful sense of mix and match, will show who's boss in the
gene dabbling business and implant a mind of her own even in this
thing of beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the first tongue stud on that designer child. Oh, don't
you wish for a tattoo that says ``Cherry Poppin' Daddies'' etched
across one perfect flank. And won't it be deliciously just when a
child of the golden egg goes in for a little cosmetic realignment
and comes out looking real, like the rest of the family. Kind of
like Aunt Bertha.

FREE AT LAST: JOYCE MAYNARD LETS HER SECRETS GO 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BILL DeYOUNG   
 The Gainesville (Fla.) Sun   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The past 12 months have not exactly been a walk in the park for
Joyce Maynard. A year ago, she published her seventh book, a memoir
called ``At Home in the World,'' in which she retraced her steps
from precocious, unfulfilled teen to successful, smart and
(relatively) stable woman.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bumpy journey, and Maynard _ no stranger to revealing
the most intimate details of her adult life through her writing _
made herself put down some pretty hurtful stuff. Central to the
story, and to understanding the girl and the woman, was Maynard's
yearlong affair with a man 35 years her senior.
</P>
<P>
   The man was literary icon J.D. Salinger. He was 53, and Maynard
was 18.
</P>
<P>
   Salinger, who hasn't published a word or even appeared in public
since the 1950s, is a revered, almost mythical figure. When Maynard
told her story, the critics tore her to ribbons. How dare she
exploit his legendary name?
</P>
<P>
   ``In the hundreds and hundreds of outraged and indignant things
that were written about this book, no one ever said, `She lied, it
never happened,''' Maynard says in a telephone interview. ``What
they said was, `She shouldn't have talked about it.' Fascinating
distinction. `She should have kept her mouth shut.'''
</P>
<P>
   Maynard was called everything from a parasite to a hack.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the notion seemed very prevalent _ and this was deeply
offensive to me _ that the one significant act of my life was
sleeping with a famous man. You know, I feel my work sort of speaks
for itself. At the point that I published this book, I had
published six other books and supported a family, I'd been a
newspaper reporter, done plenty of other things that had absolutely
nothing to do with Salinger. You could like my books or not like my
books.
</P>
<P>
   ``But to suggest that I have lived off of Salinger all my life
is a profound disavowal of the facts. And it's basically saying a
woman's story doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Before this brouhaha began, Maynard, 46, was best known for her
novel ``To Die For,'' which became a movie starring Nicole Kidman,
and for her syndicated newspaper column chronicling the rise and
fall of her own marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the divorced mother of three lives in Mill Valley, in
northern California. She's currently on a book tour that has her
fielding questions about ``At Home in the World.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, about J.D. Salinger, mostly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I supposed for most of the past 25 years that this was a book
I would never write,'' Maynard says. ``It wasn't even a
possibility. And I was regularly confronted with the task of
explaining my experience with Salinger.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, the author of ``The Catcher in the Rye'' wrote Maynard,
then a Yale freshman, a fan letter. He had seen her essay ``An
18-Year-Old Looks Back on Life'' in The New York Times Magazine.
They became pen pals, friends, lovers. She moved into his secluded
home in Cornish, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   One day, she writes, Salinger simply told her to pack up and get
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I had this obligation to silence for a long time, so I
didn't even allow myself to entertain the thought of what the story
might be,'' explains Maynard. ``I think a lot of people have some
little drawer in their life that they don't open. It's too
uncomfortable. This one was it, for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Salinger _ ``The first man I ever loved'' _ is a
prominent figure in Maynard's book, he is just one of a cast of
characters. ``At Home in the World'' is about her children, her
ex-husband, her friends, her parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very rare that I can ever have a conversation that I
don't find myself talking about growing up in an alcoholic
family,'' the author explains. ``It's one of the core experiences
of my life. And this book, much more than it's about Salinger, is a
book about that. It's about growing up feeling like very much of an
outsider. And feeling that there was something wrong with me.''
</P>
<P>
   She is steadfast in her belief that the truth, however painful,
is a liberating thing. ``Creating work that doesn't move a reader
doesn't particularly interest me,'' she says. ``Doing work that is
just for me, that nobody read or cared about, that didn't affect
their life, seems like a fairly hollow pursuit to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really interested in the reader out there, and I believe
there are many, who also had some of these kinds of growing-up
experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as the indignation about ``At Home in the World'' was dying
down, Maynard put a collection of Salinger's letters _ those he
wrote to her while reeling her in during that long-ago spring of
'72 _ up for auction at Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
   She was again reviled, insulted and accused of exploiting
Salinger's name. But she was taking something back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would I not sell them? Why would I have some obligation to
keep a bunch of letters that for me were the record of an abusive
experience, tucked away in my drawer? That could help put one of my
kids through college? Instead I should tuck them away to preserve
the reputation of J.D. Salinger?''
</P>
<P>
   A private collector paid $140,000 for the letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have any kind of a moral problem with it,'' she adds.
``I should add that these letters are not the gooey, messy, sexual
sort of stuff that'll embarrass a person. The only thing that's
really embarrassing about those letters was already known: that a
53-year-old man wrote them to an 18-year-old girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Maynard passes no judgment on Salinger in ``At Home With the
World.'' She was, after all, a willing participant. She merely
states the facts as she saw them.
</P>
<P>
   That covers yesterday and today. As for tomorrow, ``I'm done
with this story. The next damn time somebody says `What about J.D.
Salinger?' I can hand them my book. I don't ever have to tell this
story again. I'm so ready to be free of it.''

`42 UP': AT 42, A POINT OF RECKONING FOR CHILDREN OF 1964
</HEADLINE>
 (Production notes at end)  
(nk) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Tony was 7, he was a grinning Cockney optimist from the
East End of London, spouting plans to become a jockey and cavorting
exuberantly at the playground. Now he can be seen as a 42-year-old
who dodges sour glances from his glum-looking wife, a woman who was
once filmed by Michael Apted as Tony's beaming young sweetheart.
``I must say, it's not easy being married,'' says Tony, with the
boyish scrappiness and joy long gone from his face. About his life
as a cabby with a fenced-in suburban back yard, he acknowledges:
``I think this must be the limitations for me now.''
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to watch Michael Apted's ``42 Up,'' the latest
in the series of milestone documentaries that began with ``7 Up,''
without more complex and piercing emotions than those prompted by
previous installments. When this hugely ambitious project began, it
was a longitudinal study of class divisions among English
schoolchildren. But time and persistence have turned it into much
more.
</P>
<P>
   An obvious labor of love for Apted, the series (which revisits
its original interview subjects every seven years) has moved beyond
the time-lapse sociology that gave it such fascination. With its
participants in middle age, the project has reached the point of
reckoning associated with an American 25th high school reunion,
with all the stark honesty that that implies.
</P>
<P>
   This haunting group portrait could once be watched for a sense
of how its participants were evolving, but by now there is a sense
of destiny fulfilled. Ambitions have been realized or thwarted.
Young romantics have become beleaguered single parents. Some
participants look eager and vital, while others still pay the price
for choices long since made. These 42-year-olds seem long past the
stage of letting chips fall where they may.
</P>
<P>
   A word about the courage of those seen in ``42 Up'': Imagine
subjecting yourself to this kind of unflinching scrutiny. The
series has been so widely seen that it is now part of the
42-year-olds and their evolution. So when Tony drives his cab, he
feels at least as famous as any of his passengers. And when Nick,
the farm boy who moved to the United States to teach at a
university, is asked by Apted about future plans, he says: ``My
ambition as a scientist is to be more famous for doing science than
for being in this film. But unfortunately, Michael, that's not
going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``42 Up,'' which opens Wednesday at the Film Forum and must be
seen by anyone following the series, has no need for new tricks. It
simply divides its time evenly among revealing portraits of those
still willing to talk to the camera. Two of the three most
privileged boys from ``7 Up'' have dropped out by now, even the one
who is himself a documentary filmmaker, but the others remain game
even when their circumstances are less than blissful. Jackie, who
has rheumatoid arthritis and is on her own with three young sons in
a bleak spot near Glasgow, says: ``I'm lucky. There are people who
are a damn sight worse off than I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the developments seen here are touchingly positive. The
boy who wanted to be a missionary, Bruce, is now teaching at a
girls' school in the East End and has unexpectedly found himself a
wife. (Like most of the participants who mention marriage, he uses
the practical word ``partnership'' to describe it.) And Susie, who
at 14 was a rebellious aristocrat and later settled down with a
family and a tennis court, is now providing bereavement counseling.
Most poignant, once again, the plight of Neil, who was once a
bright, handsome child, then became a troubled derelict who spoke
with unflinching candor. Now Neil has gotten himself elected twice
as a councilman and is obviously doing better. Who knows how much
Neil's role as the handsome, fragile Kurt Cobain of this series
helped him with voters?
</P>
<P>
   About class distinctions, its original concern, ``42 Up'' now
finds the expected: Prosperous 42-year-olds find the world a fair
place, while some of their childhood schoolmates struggle with debt
and find life much harder. Though that point has been proven, the
project and its goals live on.
</P>

MUSINGS ON PERSON NO. 6 BILLION
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 6 billionth person was born last month and I can definitely
tell the difference.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, traffic is much worse in South Florida now than it
was this same time last year. It is true that Floridians always say
traffic is worse this year than it was last year, and probably
would continue to do so if the cities sank into giant sinkholes and
ceased to exist. But that is just idle chitchat, a variation of
``Hot enough for you?'' and ``We sure needed this rain,'' whereas I
have proof.
</P>
<P>
   For example, I saw my first Michigan license plate on Oct. 30
this year compared to Nov. 10 a year ago. This is the kind of thing
that can happen when 6 billion people start jockeying for elbow
room: A butterfly beats its wings in Japan; a retired autoworker
from Lansing gets in his Lincoln Continental and drives to
Sarasota.
</P>
<P>
   No, wait. That's how hurricanes begin. Still, I think the same
theory could apply.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, I read in the paper that we are experiencing a severe
stone-crab-claw shortage and what few stone crab claws are
available are priced at what one would expect to pay for a tank of
gas for a Lincoln Continental. The paper blames this on hurricanes
that struck North Carolina, causing widespread flooding, which
destroyed a lot of pigs, not to mention pigs' feet, which are used
by Florida fishermen as bait for stone crabs.
</P>
<P>
   With the 6 billionth person having been born only a month ago,
the obvious question here is: Why on earth do stone crabs eat pigs'
feet? I've seen pickled pigs' feet in those big glass jars,
swimming around in some sort of unidentified red liquid _ I'm
guessing cherry Kool-Aid and vinegar _ and it's not the sort of
thing that strikes me as a gourmet delight, especially among your
high-end crustaceans.
</P>
<P>
   If pigs' feet aren't available, why can't we substitute
something else? Like a Big Mac or maybe a wad of Spam. If I were a
stone crab and I had been fed a steady diet of pink, waterlogged,
Kool-Aid-scented pigs' feet, I think I would virtually leap into
the boat if someone waved a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in front of
my nose, or whatever passes for a nose on a stone crab.
</P>
<P>
   (The fact that stone crabs are selling for $14.95 a pound is
further evidence that they are holding out for a better class of
bait. It is entirely possible that by the time the 7 billionth
human is born, stone-crab traps will have to be baited with filet
mignon.)
</P>
<P>
   Since the 6 billionth person was born, I have also noted an
upswing in TV commercials by Linda McCartney, which is doubly
strange given the fact that Linda McCartney is dead. Linda is a
(deceased) spokeswoman for People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals, an organization whose members, one must presume, are also
not big pigs'-feet eaters.
</P>
<P>
   Linda's message was that people should stop fishing because
fishing is a form of torture and/or murder, depending on whether or
not you let the fish go. She gave as evidence the fact that fish,
when removed from the water, flop around and gasp for air, a sign
that they feel pain.
</P>
<P>
   As hard as it is for me to discount the opinion of someone who
feels so strongly about her cause that she is willing to defend it
from beyond the grave, I intend to continue eating fish, preferably
grilled or sauteed in lemon butter. However, if she can prove that
broccoli emits a silent scream of agony when you throw it into the
steamer, I promise to stop eating it immediately.
</P>
<P>
   I am not saying that human being No. 6 billion is personally
responsible for early tourists from Michigan, the pigs'-feet
shortage, fussy stone crabs or Linda McCartney's reincarnation.
</P>
<P>
   But if Sarasota were suddenly swallowed up by a giant sinkhole,
I'd definitely start getting suspicious.

 &HT;    INTERNET IMAGES SHINE AT COMDEX
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Judging by the buzz Tuesday at the Comdex computer
trade show, sharing your favorite snapshots online with family and
friends or, if you like, with the whole world, will be the next big
thing to hit the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   With prices for digital cameras, scanners and ink-jet color
printers falling fast, as quality continues to improve, the
consumer market for Internet images appears ready to forge ahead.
Spurring growth, experts here say, will be faster Internet
pipelines into homes, improved compression formats and
user-friendly Web sites. The sites offer easy remote editing of
pictures while hosting free storage and retrieval services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential for huge growth is certainly there,'' said
Kristy Holch. As head of the Infotrends Research Group, a
Boston-based market consulting firm, Holch invited Bill Gates and
other industry leaders to review the latest online imaging trends
with reporters and analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Gates spoke not as Microsoft's chairman but in his lesser-known
role as the 1989 founder and sole owner of Corbis, home to some 65
million digital images, with more than 2.1 million of them
available online. The company licenses its huge library to
professionals as well as offering consumers both fee-based and free
services on its web site, www.corbis.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to browsing (online) for the photos that you're
most interested in, it's still too slow,'' Gates said, ``You'd be
better off to have somebody FedEx you a bunch of photos and then
look through those,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   But such frustrations should ease soon, Gates predicted, as U.S.
households increasingly become equipped with speedy links to
cyberspace, through new technologies that are currently entering
the broad marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Gates predicted, flat-panel screens, speakers and
wireless networks will become commonplace items in American homes.
``They are already installed in the house that I live in,'' Gates
noted, ``but of course not at a reasonable price.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll be able to go through your database and pick out
life-like images,'' he said. ``And you can put them on whatever
screen you prefer, whether it's in your living room or on the
refrigerator.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen how quickly other people catch up with the
richest man in the world in the image-capture department. ``Bill
has access at his home to stuff that even we can't look at,'' said
Peter Howe, Corbis' vice president for photography and creative
services, after Gates had left the room.
</P>
<P>
   According to Infotrends' Holch, by the end of the year, 8
percent of U.S. households will own either a digital camera, a
camcorder or a ``roving eye'' tethered to a personal computer now.
Fewer than 15 percent own a scanner, Holch said.
</P>
<P>
   But even consumers with access to only $5 toss-away cameras can
smoothly move into the digital realm if they have an Internet
account.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Kodak and America Online created a ``You've
Got Pictures'' facility that is proving increasingly popular with
AOL's 18 million customers.
</P>
<P>
   Users take their film in to be developed and pick up their
prints and negatives in normal fashion. But if they check a box and
fill in their screen name, their pictures will also be delivered
electronically to a PC via the Internet. From there, AOL makes it a
simple task for users to e-mail the pictures or to store them on a
computer's hard drive
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, both dedicated and portal-based ``photo
communities'' are sprouting on the Internet. ``Its the Poloraid
effect,'' said David Rowley, president of PhotoPoint, one such
image hosting site. ``People love to see the picture at once and to
share it quickly with others.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowley's service, at www.photopoint.com, allows its members
unlimited free storage of their photos online. They can be
captioned, cropped and linked to online auction sites, such as
eBay. Users can determine who else, if anyone, can view their
virtual albums.
</P>
<P>
   But even if sites such as PhotoPoint should blossom, they'll
still be a place for old-fashioned prints, to be largely digitally
produced in the future, said Bruce Chizen, executive vice president
of Adobe Systems, a leading supplier of image editing software.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will still want to have a piece of paper to work
with,'' Chizen predicted.

 &HT;    LEGISLATORS, CIVIL RIGHTS GROUPS OPPOSE JEB BUSH FOR ELIMINATING
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PROGRAMS
 &HT;    With photos.
 &HT;    BY SUE SCHULTZ
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington _ Federal lawmakers joined civil rights groups
Tuesday to speak out against ending affirmative action in Florida
as proposed by Gov. Jeb Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``The affirmative action law was all we had for a chance at
equality of opportunity,'' said Rep. Carrie Meek, a Democrat from
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   An executive order issued by Bush last week reaffirmed the
state's commitment to pursuing diversity, it but eliminated
affirmative actionprograms for university admissions, state
contracts and government employment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush says he wants to promote diversity, but he
doesn't want laws to enforce it,'' Rep. Corrine Brown, a Democrat
from Jacksonville, said. ``But without these laws, diversity and
opportunity won't exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said affirmative action gave her the opportunity to run
for elected office in Florida as a black woman. She held up a pie
with a sliver cut out illustrating the small number_ 2 percent _ of
state contracts that women and minorities receive from Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the pie is sliced up,'' Brown said, ``we need to all get
a piece. As it stands now, we barely get a sliver.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown sent letters alerting the Justice Department and other
federal agencies of Florida's plans to drop statewide affirmative
action last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush's decision to eliminate equal opportunity
programs in the state of Florida is a mistake, and the
repercussions will be felt for generations to come,'' said Hilary
Shelton, Washington director of the NAACP.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Alcee Hastings, a Democrat from Miramar, criticized Bush
for not consulting with black and minority lawmakers before issuing
the order.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it was a mistake for Governor Bush to fail to reach
out to the five black and Hispanic members of Congress, for it is
our communities who are to be impacted,'' Hastings said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Conyers, a D-Mich, and ranking member of the House
Judiciary Committee, called for hearings on Bush's order before the
committee, which has rejected proposals to end affirmative action
in the past.

 &HT;    CRUSADE ENDS FOR OIL'S TOP SENATE DEFENDER
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the past year and a half, Sen. Kay Bailey
Hutchison, R-Texas, resolutely defended oil companies from paying
higher royalties for drilling on public lands.
</P>
<P>
   Almost single-handedly, she shut down action in the Senate on
the annual Interior appropriation bill until her colleagues agreed
to postpone new royalty regulations for at least one more year.
</P>
<P>
   But as Congress rushed to complete annual spending bills for the
federal government this week, the Republican leadership quietly
pulled the plug on Hutchison's crusade.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., the key Interior appropriations
subcommittee chairman who had backed her before, told White House
negotiators Monday that the leadership would seek no more delays
for the royalty system, set to go into effect next March 15.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton will formalize his promise by letter or by a floor
statement, his spokeswoman, Cynthia Bergman, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison's response was resigned. ``I'm disappointed with the
agreement,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing to attack the proposed new royalty system as
``complicated and unworkable,'' she predicted, as she has for more
than a year, that it will threaten jobs created by independent oil
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remain hopeful that the new (Minerals Management Service)
director will work with Congress and the producers during this
shortened moratorium period to develop a fair and effective rule,''
she said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new system, the industry is expected to pay $66
million more a year for drilling on federal property.
</P>
<P>
   The royalty payments are designated for education, conservation,
parks, state governments and Indian reservations. Critics have long
charged that the current system is so lax that it permits companies
to short-change the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``This win shows that ordinary citizens can still prevail in
Washington,'' said Danielle Brian, executive director of Project on
Government Oversight. The Washington-based watchdog group has led
the effort to make oil companies pay the full bill owed for
drilling on the public's land.
</P>
<P>
   States, including Alaska, California and Texas, have collected
nearly $5 billion in lawsuit settlements in royalty disputes.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, Hutchison has been the energy industry's top
defender as well as its top campaign money recipient. During the
last election cycle, the oil and gas industry donated $1.2 million
to her re-election effort.
</P>
<P>
   The American Petroleum Institute Tuesday restated its opposition
to the royalty rules drafted by the Clinton administration as too
complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have consistently said that the industry wants a rule that
is fair, simple, workable and that conforms to existing statutory
and lease provisions,'' the group said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The institute called on the Minerals Management Service to start
from scratch on the royalty rules.

 &HT;    New generation of buyers discovers something different in
contemporary lines
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, Nov. 16.
 &HT;    By Danny Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Soon after moving into his condo in Midtown Atlanta
two years ago, Daylon Lutzenberger faced a dilemma shared by other
first-time home buyers.
</P>
<P>
   His furnishings, a mix of hand-me-downs and inexpensive pieces
acquired since college, were comfortable, but their traditional
look didn't reflect the fresh modern environment of a high-rise
unit with its skyline view. ``I'd gotten very tired of all the dark
woods and formal prints,'' said the 34-year-old telecommunications
manager for Ernst &AMP; Young.
</P>
<P>
   Lutzenberger wanted a more contemporary feel, but it wasn't the
radical leap to sleek surfaces and harsh lines he sought. By
working on a limited budget with an interior designer, he
discovered a warm transitional look that comes from furnishings
with clean lines, light woods, satin metal finishes and textured
fabrics _ one that fits his busy lifestyle to a T.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contemporary is something that speaks of today's time and
place,'' said Herbert Brito, Lutzenberger's designer.
</P>
<P>
   And, as young successful professionals move in on baby boomers
in the home decorating market, manufacturers are responding with
soft contemporary furnishings that create comfortable, inviting
rooms while giving buyers something a little different.
</P>
<P>
   Those furnishings became a common thread among lines shown this
month at the Chicago Design Show, the nation's top trade preview of
high-end contemporary pieces from around the world, destined for
showrooms by early 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Driving them, designers said, are a number of factors _ fashion
trends, mass media design exposure, a nostalgic recall of classic
lines as a new century looms, a strong economy ripe for risk
taking, the home invasion of technology.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, a market dominated by traditional tastes,
contemporary continues to make noteworthy inroads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think old Atlanta is still in a traditional mind-set for the
most part,'' said Atlanta interior designer Charles Gandy. ``But we
have so many people moving in here from all over the world that the
concepts of the traditional South are slowly changing and becoming
more contemporary.''
</P>
<P>
   Planning for technology
</P>
<P>
   Many contemporary consumers are transient professionals eager to
express themselves differently from their baby boomer parents. ``A
lot of the wealth in the past few years has been among young people
with Internet start-ups,'' said Mayer Rus, editor of Interior
Design magazine.
</P>
<P>
   They're not in gray suits sitting behind desks but in blue jeans
juggling laptops. ``It's a new generation trying to define itself
with a different way of showing its success,'' Rus said.
</P>
<P>
   They're opting for furnishings with clean, simple lines yet ones
that make a statement among the mass-produced ``suites'' their
parents bought. They're often turning to classic modern pieces
considered cutting edge in their day and now dubbed a collective
``retro'' by young buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's sort of the right time for them. They're young
enough to care about it,'' Julia-Carr Baylor said of the vintage
modern furnishings she sells in her Atlanta showroom, Belvedere.
``It's all about good lines and shapes. And I think, at the end of
the day, if something's designed really well it always comes back
in style.''
</P>
<P>
   While looking back, young consumers also must look forward,
because the impact that technology will have on homes can't be
underestimated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology is going to explode, and as it does it will change
how we design homes,'' said interior designer Gandy. ``No longer
will we need an armoire. We'll just hang the TV on the wall like a
picture. We used to never do home offices. Now, everybody has
one.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge will be to maintain the cozy atmosphere of home
while avoiding the harsh look of the office. To do that, more
emphasis than ever may be placed on furnishings.
</P>
<P>
   Though plenty of manufacturers at the Chicago show offered
sleek, high-tech designs, the emphasis was on soft, clean lines and
warm materials.
</P>
<P>
   In his American Revisionist collection for FreWil, Los Angeles
designer Bil Wilson created a classic yet contemporary line of
'40s-inspired furnishings that borrows elements from both a
traditionalist, Duncan Phyfe, and a modernist, Paul Frankyl.
``Until now, most of my collections have been high modern,'' he
said. ``With this, I'm going for a broader traditional market that
wants clean lines but not the same old thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The transitional pieces easily could blend with both traditional
and contemporary decors.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Brand Furniture was targeting the lure of nostalgia with a
collection that recalls the Hollywood glamour of the same era.
Chairs with gentle curves and contoured lines feature maple with
textured fabrics that make you want to snuggle, while a glasstop
coffee table offers a more contemporary feel with its mix of steel,
leather and Douglas fir.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going after the first-time home buyer who wants comfort
and style but with an almost heirloom quality,'' Brand said. ``The
pieces have contemporary refinement but are almost traditional in
nature.''
</P>
<P>
   That's just the transition designers say a growing number of new
homeowners like Lutzenberger are after.
</P>
<P>
   Making the shift
</P>
<P>
   Because his job requires him to travel so much, the Atlantan
wanted his first home to be an inviting retreat that offers
everything a hotel, office and airplane don't. He wanted a calm and
relaxing interior away from the buzz of computers and cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   His designer, Brito, helped him create such a setting that
emphasizes warm, natural materials but with simple lines that play
off the urban locale of Atlanta's Hanover House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all slowly evolved,'' Lutzenberger recalled. ``Generally,
Americans think of contemporary as black and white and chrome, very
sterile and cold. But we used warm tones, such as textured sisal
and wool rugs and a mix of leather and fabrics along with granite,
limestone and lots of maple.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he was able to take advantage of Brito's access to
products available only to the trade, most of the furnishings came
from mainstream contemporary retailers, such as Innovations and
Domus.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something done on a shoestring,'' Brito said, ``but we
kept it very simple, shopped around and then customized a few
things we couldn't find so that his money went into some special
pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   In the dining room, he designed a round glasstop table with
sapple wood base, then paired it with simple chrome and birch
Philippe Starck chairs.
</P>
<P>
   In the master bedroom, Lutzenberger needed an attractive
headboard, so Brito created a large concave square substitute and
upholstered it to pick up the lines and upholstery of a bedside
chair and ottoman. ``For someone who doesn't have an interesting
bed or can't afford the art to hang over one, you can let a
headboard like this become the focal point of the room,'' the
designer said.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkled throughout the two-story condo are remnants of
Lutzenberger's past love for traditional _ an old black trunk here,
a mahogany armoire there _ which don't seem that out of place with
his new passion for soft contemporary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been quite a journey to get to this point,'' he said,
``but now when I come home after traveling all week, this is where
I want to be. It's so fresh and clean and comfortable, it's almost
therapeutic.''

 &HT;    Greens take the spotlight in Meriwether woman's garden this time
of year
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, Nov. 18.
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRANTVILLE, Ga. _ Ellen Frances Rosser, like so many food
gardeners, never stops growing for the table. Assorted victuals
thrive even as food crops for us hot-weather growers fade into
faraway memory.
</P>
<P>
   For dabblers like me, the list of edibles is pitifully short to
begin with, as is harvest time; my tomatoes and cayenne peppers, my
1999 food output, are long gone. But, when I visited Rosser
recently at her Meriwether County home near the Coweta line, the
growing patch was so lush, it might as well have been summer.
</P>
<P>
   Collards, cabbage, several types of mustards and turnips were
fully leafed out, beckoning us _ Rosser, her south Fulton County
daughter Marsha Ramsey, and me _ to admire.
</P>
<P>
   How tender the lovely green leaves look and feel this time of
year, when so much else in the garden has shriveled and died. What
culinary memories they evoke. And what promises they make as
Thanksgiving, that greatest of all eating holidays, draws near.
</P>
<P>
   Across the yard, rose and other blooms added their own fresh,
fragrant contrast to the season of supposed decline _ most notably,
the camellia that was planted in a 1-gallon nursery container 20
years ago. It remains in that container, its roots grown through
the bottom to support its 10-foot height.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was engaged in something else,'' explained Rosser, who is 83
years old. ``I never got around to planting it.''
</P>
<P>
   Food crops always were planted, though. Ever since Rosser and
her husband, parents of 11 children, moved into this home in
November 1941. Recent crops include corn, peas and okra, one of
whose 6-foot skeletons still stood on this day, a single pod
perched atop the plant, drying.
</P>
<P>
   But greens star these days. I could just taste them on a
Thanksgiving plate, seasoned with fatback or ham hock, accented
with okra and joined by corn bread and mashed potatoes, pork chops,
duck, peas, beans _ and whatever else talented cooks make for us
eager eaters.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey, a star chef and caterer, whose sumptuous dishes of
barbecue, chicken and all manner of vegetables and pies warm the
hearts of many, was eager to get picking. So, she waded into the
greens patch and filled a bag with leaves while her mother
kibitzed, warning her daughter not to damage the tender treasures.
</P>
<P>
   Appetites whetted but still a few hours away from mealtime, the
three of us went inside to do what food lovers do when we're not
eating: We talked about eating. Dominating the kitchen and our
conversation was a luxury model Maytag gas range, now almost 50
years old, white enamel, trimmed in real chrome.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Rosser said, her children have urged, ``Mama,
get yourself a new stove.'' But she always replies: ``This stove
knows me, and I know it. I don't want to learn any new
appliances.''
</P>
<P>
   As we stood around this incredible cooking machine, mother and
daughter recalled the meals it has known, while my mouth watered at
the memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all learned how to cook on this stove,'' said Ramsey of her
brothers and sisters.
</P>
<P>
   And they all learned how to grow in the garden. As their mother
still does.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't be fall without my greens,'' Rosser said.
``They'll be here for Christmas,'' getting tender in the chills and
freezes. By then, Rosser will be thinking of spring crops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Planting is never over with me,'' she said. ``I just love my
garden year-round.''

 &HT;    MTV on Holocaust: A horrific history lesson'
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Living skeletons wander through concentration camps. Naked
corpses are thrown into a pit. Synagogues burn.
</P>
<P>
   The images of the Holocaust are profoundly disturbing, but when
they're given the MTV treatment _ whip-edited into a brain-jarring,
jangling frenzy, speeding by so fast as to be almost subliminal _
they become unbearable.
</P>
<P>
   Bear it. MTV's Holocaust special tonight is deeply righteous
television, a blend of hip style and timeless content that
shouldn't work but does. Older folks will probably hate it, but
MTV's target audience _ roughly 12- to 24-year-olds _ will get the
history lesson of their young lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``BIOrhythm'' is MTV's version of A&AMP;E's ``Biography'' series,
half-hour assemblages of snippets on pop culturati such as Britney
Spears and Jim Carrey. Producer Jeff Olde, who did a ``BIO'' last
year on the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., says he wanted to continue
to stretch the show. So he went to Steven Spielberg's SHOAH
Foundation, which tapes interviews with Holocaust survivors, and
they pointed him to Bert Strauss, 74, who was a teenage Jew in
Germany when Hitler came to power.
</P>
<P>
   ``This situation will not last long,'' Strauss recalls his
family saying as the Nazis enacted anti-Jewish laws. ``It's a
temporary solution.'' Within a few years he was in a railroad car
headed to a death camp called Stutthof, where he recalls ``the
smoke, the odor of burning flesh.'' He was 15.
</P>
<P>
   Strauss, who speaks at high schools about the Holocaust, is the
story here, but he's also a symbolic stand-in for the 6 million
Jews killed in the Holocaust, and the millions of others who died.
</P>
<P>
   The special jumps maniacally between Strauss' interview and the
archival horrors, which play like a fever dream. But Strauss'
detailed narrative, and Olde's onscreen fact-flashing, leave no
doubt that this was no dream, that this happened. And is still
happening, in its own twisted way _ one of the last images in the
show is of an American rally of neo-Nazi youth earlier this year,
giving the raised-arm salute to a giant burning swastika.
</P>
<P>
   In a half hour (22 minutes without commercials) there can be no
real depth or context given. That is for other endeavors, and
``BIO'' should not be faulted for being what it is.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    How to construct garden scales
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, Nov. 18.
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you've ever read the instructions for applying
fertilizers, insecticides or weed preventers to your lawn and
scratched your head, you're not alone.
</P>
<P>
   They typically call for spreading X amount over X area.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you don't have a spreader for putting out .5 pounds of
crabgrass preventer per 1,000 square feet, for example, how do you
measure?'' said Walter Reeves, the Georgia Extension Service's
horticulture educator.
</P>
<P>
   His fifth-grade science teacher taught him well.
</P>
<P>
   In his metro Atlanta yard, Reeves creates a makeshift set of
garden scales using a carpenter's level, heavy-gauge wire and a
pair of plastic buckets, then suspends the contraption from a tree.
</P>
<P>
   Using the baseline of 1 pint equaling 1 pound, Reeves begins
filling one bucket with water and the other with the desired amount
of material until the level indicates the scales are balanced. He
remembers the parts by reciting the old saw ``A pint is a pound the
world around.''
</P>
<P>
   The simple apparatus takes only minutes to assemble and costs
less than $10, he said.
</P>
<P>
   STEP 1: Using heavy cord and wire, Walter Reeves hangs a
carpenter's level from a tree and drills a hole in each end of the
level. He then hangs a bucket from each side, attaching it with
wire threaded through one of the holes.
</P>
<P>
   STEP 2: Pour a pint of water (16 ounces) into one of the
buckets. This will be the equivalent of 1 pound.
</P>
<P>
   STEP 3 and 4: Pour fertilizer (in this case, the granular kind)
into the other bucket, stopping when the bubble is in the center of
the level. The scales will have measured a pound of fertilizer.

 &HT;    Bradley's new TV spots makes formal introduction to voters
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Saying Bill Bradley is still largely unknown
despite 11 months of campaigning, his campaign previewed two
television ads Tuesday designed to introduce Bradley to voters.
</P>
<P>
   A 60-second biographical spot set to begin in Iowa today and New
Hampshire Thursday portrays Bradley as a ``basketball hero'' and a
straight-talking senator who tackled tax reform, race and health
care while in office.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign on Tuesday also launched a new feature on Bradley's
Web site that allows Internet users to access streaming video of
Bradley and other senators talking about his life and record.
</P>
<P>
   In campaign appearances, Bradley has sought to portray himself
as a Washington outsider who led a life outside of politics before
winning a New Jersey Senate seat in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   But the biographical ad focuses heavily on Bradley's Washington
experience, flashing views of the Capitol and including brief
interviews with Sens. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) and Bob
Kerrey (D-Neb.).
</P>
<P>
   The script includes some hyperbole. Moynihan describes the 1986
Tax Reform Act, which Bradley sponsored, as the ``first major
reform of the 20th century. . . Bill made it happen,'' Moynihan
says to the camera.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley played a central role in the bill, but he was one of
many members of Congress, including Rep. Dick Gephardt (D-Mo.), now
the House minority leader, and former Republican Sen. Bob Packwood
of Oregon, who had a hand in the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The ad also features a New Jersey woman named Maureen Drumm, who
went to Bradley when he was in the Senate and urged him to support
legislation requiring insurers to cover two days of hospital care
for childbirth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks to Senator Bradley, my daughter is alive today,'' Drumm
says in the spot. Bradley's bill ending so-called ``drive-through
deliveries'' became law in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley spokeswoman Anita Dunn also said the spots were
presented to focus groups for feedback. But she said the
focus-group input did not change the overall message of the ads.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has repeatedly said that his campaign would not rely on
polls or focus groups, but instead communicate what he believes is
right for the country.
</P>
<P>
   A second ad, set to air in both Iowa and New Hampshire next
week, features Bradley pledging to run a substantive campaign based
on issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wouldn't it be better if we had more than sound bites and
photo ops when we were choosing a candidate?'' Bradley says.
``Sometimes you'll agree with me; sometimes you won't. But at least
you'll know exactly where I stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Both ads were produced by a consortium of advertising experts
from Washington to Madison Avenue. Vice President Al Gore already
has run four different ads in the two battleground states, and Dunn
said Bradley was to some extent playing catch-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Bradley is still not as well known to people,'' Dunn
said. ``They know the vice president very well. . . . We need to
have voters get to know Bill Bradley.''

   MICH-YOUTH-VERDICT (Pontiac, Mich.) _ In a case highlighting a
recent national trend toward putting children on trial as adults, a
state jury convicted a boy here on Tuesday of second-degree murder

   YOUNG-HUNTERS (Chester, N.J.) _ Shooting programs for children
are nothing new; the NRA and private gun clubs have had them for
generations. In recent years, state wildlife agencies around the
country have run special youth hunts for an assortment of game,
including wild pigs, rabbits, ducks and deer. But a recent New
Jersey pheasant shoot was an example of a newer and growing
phenomenon _ of public state-wildlife agencies and the gun lobby
working hand in hand to promote hunting among children. By Andrew

   FED-RATES (Washington) _ The Federal Reserve raised interest
rates by a quarter of a percentage point on Tuesday, saying that
the combination of strong growth and low unemployment had left the
economy vulnerable to an outbreak of inflation. It was the third
time this year that the central bank has raised rates to check the
economy's momentum, and clearly signaled that the Fed's growing
faith in technology to improve business efficiency and temper
inflationary pressures has its limits. By Richard W. Stevenson.

CONCILIATORY WORDS FROM BOTH SIDES BODE WELL FOR PEACE IN ULSTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ The rival Sinn Fein and Ulster
Unionist parties buried decades of feuding and recrimination
Tuesday with an exchange of mutually accommodating pledges that
looked likely to end the stalemate blocking progress in the
Northern Ireland peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the political ally of the
Irish Republican Army, said his party ``wishes to work with, not
against the unionists'' and addressed their principal concern by
saying that paramilitary disarmament would be a vital part of any
political settlement and that violent conflict is ``now a thing of
the past, over, done with and gone.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement passed out at the Stormont Castle buildings where
11 weeks of talks conducted by George Mitchell, the former U.S.
senator, are ending on a surge of optimism, Adams declared, ``IRA
guns are silent, and the Sinn Fein leadership is confident that the
IRA remains committed to the objective of a permanent peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ulster Unionist leader, David Trimble, reading his
deliberately worded statement from the steps of the office complex,
said: ``We now have a chance to create a genuine partnership
between unionists and nationalists in a novel form of government.
The UUP is committed to the principles of inclusivity, equality and
mutual respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Ulster Unionists are those, mostly Protestant, who favor keeping
Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom while nationalists and
republicans, who tend to be Catholics, favor eventual union with
the Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The conciliatory words drew a comment filled with wonder from
Monica McWilliams of the Women's Coalition, which was a party to
the original peace talks that produced the April 1998 accord.
``These are kinds of statements that we thought were never possible
in Northern Ireland,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Notably, Trimble said that the deadlock over guerrilla
disarmament _ which has prevented a start-up of the political
institutions created by the accord _ would end if the IRA agreed to
name a go-between to the independent commission on disarmament
headed by a retired Canadian general, John de Chastelain. That is
precisely the pledge the IRA is expected to make in its own
statement on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The choreographed series of remarks began with statements Monday
from Mitchell, de Chastelain and various party leaders and were
intended to win over the many distrustful members of Trimble's
party.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of Ulster Unionists have adopted a
line-in-the-sand position called ``no guns, no government.'' They
insist that the proposed Northern Ireland coalition government,
structured to divide power among the Protestant majority and the
Catholic minority, can take office only when the IRA begins
dismantling its arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   As favorable as the prospects were becoming for putting the
peace agreement into effect after 19 months of stubborn delay, the
struggle to obtain the necessary Ulster Unionist support in a Nov.
27 meeting of the 850-member party council remains a formidable
obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   As the Mitchell rescue mission progressed, it increasingly
focused on Trimble and Adams, men who previously had not even been
capable of speaking to each another but who in recent weeks have
become comfortable together. The Ulster Unionist leader
consequently emerged with a belief in the dependability of Sinn
Fein promises that he will now have to put to his doubting party
members. They have had either no dealings, or exclusively hostile
ones, with Adams, a much demonized figure in their community.
</P>
<P>
   If Trimble succeeds in swaying his party, the nomination of the
members of the cabinet to run the Northern Ireland Assembly and the
passage of the legislation in the House of Commons transferring
home rule powers from London to Belfast would follow in days.
Disarmament would begin two months later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we'll be able to get to work on the real business, and I
can say for myself and for my party colleagues, we are bursting to
get at the real jobs,'' said Trimble in an ebullient appearance at
a jobs announcement ceremony in nearby Portadown Tuesday afternoon
with Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary, Peter Mandelson.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson, a close aide to Prime Minister Tony Blair, has a
reputation as a crafty and effective persuader. He has offered to
travel the province in the coming days to reassure Ulster Unionist
gatherings about sharing government with Sinn Fein even in the
absence of immediate disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   He urged critics Tuesday to examine all the statements being
made before making up their minds. ``We must not allow people to
dismiss the process,'' he said, ``before it has been completed.''

TURKS GIVE AMERICAN PRESIDENT A WARM WELCOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IZMIT, Turkey _ The red carpets were rolled out. The press
gushed with praise. And even in this devastated city, traumatized
earthquake victims lined their tent floors with colorful rugs and
poured coffee to welcome President Clinton, his wife and his
daughter on this cold, rainy day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to Clintion. I love you,'' declared a sign
hand-painted by a Turkish boy, one of about 20 kindergartners being
taught in the makeshift tent school.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children of America are thinking of you,'' Clinton told
the youngsters. Hearing the translation, the excited children
shouted ``thank you!'' in English. While one child held a US flag,
the group sang the Clinton family a Turkish children's song about a
very small bird.
</P>
<P>
   For the oft-beleaguered Clinton, his visit to Turkey has been a
welcome series of greetings, compliments and gratitude for his
promises of disaster aid and closer economic ties with the United
States. His popularity here has not been hurt by a series of
anti-Clinton protests in neighboring, archrival Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Turks have been just as effusive with the first family. At a
state dinner in Clinton's honor Monday, President Suleyman Demirel
repeatedly commented on Hillary Rodham Clinton's ``elegance'' and
lauded her ``intellectual personality.''
</P>
<P>
   At the tent city in Izmit, Turkish greeters presented Mrs.
Clinton with pink roses. While the president _ who has been on a
nonstop schedule for several days _ struggled against obvious
exhaustion, and Mrs. Clinton queried mothers about the
psychological state of their children, Chelsea exhibited perhaps
the strongest emotional connection with the sufferers of the August
quake.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest Clinton held a smitten 2-year-old in her lap.
Later, children who had been in a gym class under a large tent
broke away when they saw Chelsea, swarming around her before posing
for pictures with the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   Ismail Yoldas, a paper factory worker injured in the earthquake,
expressed his ``honor and happiness to meet the president,'' as the
Clinton and Yoldas families shared cookies and tea under the
Yoldas's tent.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's headlines in the Turkish press couldn't have been more
positive if they had been written by the White House press office.
``Like a Turk,'' two newspapers described the US leader in banner
headlines, a description meant as high praise.
</P>
<P>
   Other papers headlined Clinton's Turkey-friendly message.
``Clinton: We Are On Your Side,'' said Zaman, a religious
newspaper. ``The Future Is Turkey,'' said Ortadogu, a nationalist
publication. Most papers quoted extensively from Clinton's speech
and included photos of the smiling president.
</P>
<P>
   The reception is in contrast to the welcome Clinton is expected
to get Friday, when he travels to Greece, a military ally of both
the United States and Turkey, but long at odds with Turkey over the
fate of Cyprus and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls in Greece show that 83 percent are opposed
to a visit by the US president, a State Department official said.
Clinton already has cut his visit to Greece from three days to one
day.
</P>
<P>
   But in Turkey, the feeling is almost universally friendly toward
Clinton, whose five days in the West-leaning, Islamic nation will
be the longest stay here by any US president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's rhetoric has been encouraging to the controversial
nation, often a target of criticism for its human rights record.
While even Demirel admitted that ``clearly, there is torture'' in
Turkey, Clinton was understanding, almost apologetic, saying that
even the United States had had slavery and denied voting rights to
women and non-landowners when the nation was young.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Clinton arrive empty-handed. He promised loan guarantees
to help rebuild after the most recent quake, which hit the eastern
town of Duzce on Friday. The United States is also sending 500
tents to shelter the quake victims, who are facing a cold winter.
US disaster aid teams have already been dispatched to the area to
help.
</P>
<P>
   On trade, Clinton told Turkish and American business leaders
Tuesday that the Overseas Private Investment Corp. will ``double
its activity in Turkey'' to more than $1 billion. Further, the
Export-Import Bank will provide $1 billion in lending authority to
12 Turkish banks.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey is still reeling from the effects of the Russian fiscal
crisis of 1998, as well as two quakes in three months. Annual
wholesale inflation was 65 percent in October.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Carol Lampkin was a chatty woman with a sweeping
smile who needed a lot of medical attention. And she did not want
it from anyone but Dr. Jennifer James.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lampkin's principal complaint was reflex sympathetic
dystrophy _ pain without underlying cause, the sort of phantom limb
pain amputees sometimes suffer. She had broken her neck in a
motorcycle accident when she was 23, but it did not affect her
until she was 47, and since then she had had several surgeries.
Now, at 53, she felt numbness along her right cheek down to her
first two toes. ``I feel a burning sensation and a tingling,'' she
said. ``I feel like I've been electrocuted.''
</P>
<P>
   She used a walker or a cane. Among other ailments, she suffered
from hypertension. She had had a civilian desk job with the New
York City Police Department, but work was now out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James saw her in the outpatient clinic during her first
month of internship, and she had been back repeatedly. She always
kept her appointments and Dr. James appreciated that. Inside her
clinic exam room at St. Luke's Hospital, Ms. Lampkin glowed.
Sometimes, her pain got so bad that she had to be admitted to the
hospital. She would call to inform Dr. James, and Dr. James would
make a point of dropping in to see her.
</P>
<P>
   ``What attracted me to her was she was nice and courteous,'' Ms.
Lampkin said. ``She takes the time to listen. It's not easy to get
that, because when you're in the clinic they take your blood
pressure, talk to you for a minute and you're gone. She wanted to
know about me. And if she doesn't know something, she doesn't make
it up. She goes and reads up on it.''
</P>
<P>
   In her fidelity, Ms. Lampkin represented what the teachers meant
when they talked about ``continuity of care'' _ doctor and patient
bonding like atoms in a molecule. Caring for Ms. Lampkin was what
Dr. James had in mind way back in July, when she had said, ``What a
doctor is is being compassionate and just being there for people.''
Most of the time, especially with all the pressures brought on by
managed care, the hospital moved too erratically, too fast. Here in
the spring of her internship, though, it was that kind of bond that
made Dr. James feel happiest about medicine.
</P>
<P>
   She thought fondly of another clinic patient: The first time she
saw him, she threw him out. He told her he had once worked for the
CIA and now sold books on the street and fought unknown demons. He
drank 24 to 36 beers a day and smoked heavily. He was drunk. He got
abusive. But he returned another week, behaved properly, and Dr.
James accepted him as a challenge. He had suffered a stroke but
refused necessary surgery. She coaxed him into it. Afterward, he
told her, ``You saved my life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've almost gotten him to stop smoking,'' she said, ``and we
talk about stopping drinking. I think I'm getting closer. With him,
I feel I really did something. I was a doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   She brought in her next patient. He was new, a little
turned-inward, a little bellicose. He believed he had sprained his
ankle on a crack in the sidewalk. He said the emergency room had
told him he needed new shoes, not medical care. He walked a lot. He
was homeless. He wanted an X-ray. She said that was unnecessary.
His ankles were swollen. She told him that meant something might be
going on with his heart; she wanted other tests done.
</P>
<P>
   He said no and no and no. He was loud and brassy. ``You must
think I'm stupid,'' he said. ``You don't want to spend the money on
an X-ray. If you don't want to treat me right, I'll go somewhere
else.'' She persevered. He said no. Exasperated, she brought in her
supervisor. She watched as he knelt down and listened patiently to
the man, gave credence to his opinion but nudged him toward Dr.
James' view. The man capitulated. She wondered if it was because
the supervisor was older and a man.
</P>
<P>
   She did not let that bother her. Her next two patients failed to
show up. She had time. The man's shoes were too small and tattered.
She asked him if he wanted to go to the volunteer department to
look at the donated clothes. She and her husband both gave clothing
there. She thought his feet looked the same size as her husband's.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they sifted through bins of used shoes. She dug out a
pair of 11{ sneakers. He slipped them on. ``These feel real good,''
he said. A smile blossomed. ``Thank you, doctor,'' he told her. Out
in the real world, when would she ever have time to find a man a
pair of shoes? She did not think of it that way, just that a
connection had been made. ``That was cool,'' she said. ``It felt
really cool to do that.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   A Step Off the Treadmill
</P>
<P>
   Time sped by in the final months, more of a blur. The fatigue,
though, persisted. Even during vacation, Dr. Bryan Holland slept
poorly. His body was used to no sleep. He had deliberately stopped
watching ``E.R.,'' the staple of doctors in training. It felt like
a continuation of work. His parents had given him a keyboard for
Christmas, and he unwound by playing it, mostly Mozart and some
Beethoven. He had been reading Robert Frost.
</P>
<P>
   He worked relentlessly. He found that he was really obsessive,
always wanting everything done just so, and he knew he was probably
going to drive the interns he supervised next year crazy. He had no
patience for interns who complained endlessly about how taxing the
work was. ``I think they should suck it up and go on,'' he said at
dinner one night. ``They should feel blessed that they're in the
position.''
</P>
<P>
   One day he had a treat _ a glimpse of life beyond residency. He
spent the afternoon at the private office of Dr. Steven Wolf,
director of the pediatric neurology clinic.
</P>
<P>
   He saw a succession of cases of attention deficit disorder.
</P>
<P>
   A young boy with a wild tassel of hair came in, compulsively
talkative. He could not sit still for a moment. Holland asked him
what he watched on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watch every cartoon that has green, brown or red or gray or
blue. The cartoons in black and white, I don't think they're so
funny. Did you know the `I Love Lucy Show' used to be called the `I
Can't Stand Ethel Show?'''
</P>
<P>
   His mother said he had a lot of anger inside him. He fought
constantly with his brother. The boy then interrupted to say that
his teacher liked to punch kids and kick them and pull their hair.
``He even likes electrocuting the kids,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf came in. He asked Holland to describe the movements he saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't seem like tics,'' Holland said. ``They seem
voluntary.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf said, ``Right. Just a fidgety kid with ants in his pants.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he said, ``So Dr. Holland, would you classify him as
attention deficit disorder? Dangerous word.''
</P>
<P>
   Holland: ``He's borderline, but I wouldn't classify him as that
as yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf: ``So he has symptoms of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Wolf told the mother: ``What I'd like to do is gather more
information. I'm going to give you a teacher evaluation form for
the school so we can get more information.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy said, ``To gather more information about my family,
please contact Dumb brother.com.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf said, ``This is a clever kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Holland liked being in a real office. It was far less chaotic
than the clinic, with more involved parents with better insurance
than the Medicaid patients he usually saw. To a young doctor
learning the subtle arts of diagnosis, it was a welcome step off
the clinic treadmill.
</P>
<P>
   He admired Wolf's style. But he also saw the unmistakable
pressures. With night pressing in, Wolf's staff had gone home. He
continued seeing patients, never failing to ask for every $10 and
$15 co-payment. Insurance cutbacks were killing him, he said. His
revenues dropped year by year. Having interns do some office shifts
was one way to prop up the economics. He did other things now, like
expert testimony in court cases and patient studies for drug
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, Holland came to understand that he was treating
not just a child, but also the often incoherent effects of an
environment full of perils and mysteries. ``I've learned that you
really have two patients _ the child and the mother,'' he said. ``I
notice now when mothers are calm when they bring in a sick child.
Why isn't that mother agitated? What comes to mind is, the mother
is not attentive.''
</P>
<P>
   He very much appreciated that it was strange times. Working the
ward on his final rotation, he was stupefied by a 14-year-old girl
who said she had already had 68 sexual partners. When a week later,
a 17-year-old said she had had 13 partners, no one blinked.
</P>
<P>
   And then Holland was taking a history from a mother of a
4-year-old boy. He got to the section about relatives. The mother
said the boy's sister had been shot to death two days ago. Holland
went numb. He looked at his sheet. The next part dealt with form of
payment. He could not bring himself to ask. He left it blank. The
hospital would have to figure that out.

 NEW YORK: that out.

<P>
   A Style of One's Own &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You knew the ER was clotted with patients from the bleating
chorus of voices:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my head's going to explode.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to discharge Mr. Crazy now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there really someone in 1B with a heart rate of 24?''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edward Lathan worked with focus. Steadily, he felt he was
cultivating that sixth sense that told a doctor who was really sick
and who was not. Now, he addressed an elderly man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are you in the hospital?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because my people called the ambulance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did they call the ambulance?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I laid down on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did you lay down on the floor?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   He was refining a style. He had watched one high-strung senior
doctor who, not getting the answers he wanted from a patient, would
squeeze his gloved hands together until you could hear the
squishing noise. Lathan vowed never to do that. ``I'll touch a
patient on the arm, or, if it's appropriate, brush some hair out of
their face, to show I'm caring,'' he said. ``It's my own little
technique.''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed beyond imagination how many patients he had treated.
Some still haunted him, like the 21-year-old lifeguard who, while
practicing holding his breath under water, passed out, threw up and
gagged. He came in without a heartbeat and could not be revived.
``He was so young,'' Lathan said. ``He was about to touch his
dreams. I had been a lifeguard.''
</P>
<P>
   From the start, he had felt a special kinship with the destitute
who gravitated to the ER, and he still tried to look out for them.
But he was less tolerant of those who took advantage of him, for
there had been so many. He had a woman with leg ulcers, and when he
tried to wrap her legs, she declared every action wrong. In
exasperation, he left the supplies with her and told her to wrap
her own legs. When she was done, she hung around for a free
breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   He had learned that it was all right to hate patients who were
difficult or obnoxious, as long as you still took care of them.
Granted, you got irritated when someone got a fever at 5 a.m. or
pulled out an IV during your only nap, but you still went ahead and
did what needed doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone is sick, I don't have the right to be nasty to
him,'' explained Dr. Michael Lesch, the head of the medicine
department.
</P>
<P>
   Lesch liked to tell a story from his own internship: A fireman
brought in five children with severe burns. Their father had got
angry at the mother and set the house on fire. The father sat in
the next room with burns on his skin. Lesch had to go in and treat
him. ``We see some bad people,'' he told the interns. ``We see
people at their worst.''
</P>
<P>
   Lathan treated a man with multiple stab wounds. His girlfriend
had sliced him up. She had some minor bruises herself. She was a
vile person, cursing and spitting at everyone. ``She was someone
you wanted to hate,'' Lathan said. Nevertheless, he was prepared to
treat her, but someone else had taken her.
</P>
<P>
   `I Have Become More Detached'
</P>
<P>
   What? Statues had metamorphosed into actual people and were
marching across the adjacent roof? Alert the newspapers right away?
</P>
<P>
   So the patient insisted. She was in her 70s, chirpy, with
steel-gray hair, awaiting heart surgery. She was taking steroids
for swelling in her legs. They sometimes triggered hallucinations.
Dr. James was peremptory, assuring her the statues were inanimate.
(It could be worse. On another floor, a man complained that a
helicopter hovered in his room.)
</P>
<P>
   As she neared the July 1 state of bliss known as the end of
internship, Dr. James found that the surprises still came, but the
bigger surprise was her palpable ease in dealing with them. As the
golden light of morning poured through the hospital windows, Dr.
James traversed her world with brisk assurance. Many things that
were once challenges had become perfunctory. There was a momentum
of familiarite days.
</P>
<P>
   When she began her internship, Dr. James had been tentative and
submissive, beset by qualms about what the year would bring. Now,
she felt she could manage even the most sadistic senior doctors.
``I decide they have some psychological problem themselves,'' she
said. If someone picked on her, she could push right back. One day
she was reading a chart when a nurse's note stopped her cold:
``Unable to draw my labs. Paged Dr. James at 7 a.m. and got no
response.'' Dr. James returned fire. She wrote on the chart: ``In
response to above comment, I was in the hospital promptly at 7 a.m.
and received no pages.''
</P>
<P>
   She did still encounter jitters when a complex patient arrived
and she was alone. Recently, when she admitted someone with
multiple problems, she ordered every test she could think of _
``the works,'' she called it _ so she wouldn't miss anything.
</P>
<P>
   But she was far less convinced that she would miss things. She
saw an AIDS patient and took care of some treatment orders. ``See,
I'm getting more resident efficient,'' she said. ``I saw the
patient and I'm putting in the orders and I haven't called the
resident.''
</P>
<P>
   She took much less time with new admissions. (``The first week,
it would take me at least two hours. Now if I'm in a real hurry to
catch the bus and it's uncomplicated, I could do it in a
half-hour.'') Her diagnostic abilities had sharpened. She was more
confident doing procedures. She could take notes and write a
prescription and listen to a patient talk about what a jerk her
son-in-law was all at the same time. She could go on and on.
</P>
<P>
   One of her last rotations was the harrowing ``night float'' _
instituted a few years ago in an effort to keep interns' hours
under new limits _ when Dr. James covered for all the other interns
on the wards from 10:30 p.m. to 8 a.m. One night, she had 161
patients, most of them, fortunately, asleep. She had to do a bunch
of IV's and blood draws. She had to sign an incident report for
someone who had ``eloped'' _ simply walked off the ward. But she
was unfazed.
</P>
<P>
   With patients exiting the wards so much faster, she recognized
that it was harder to get a sense of the progress of disease
through the human body. She tried to compensate by mustering a
composite patient from different patients at different stages of
sickness. How well that worked, it was hard to tell.
</P>
<P>
   Necessarily, she had hardened. ``There's illness and disease in
the world, and some people get them and my job is to help those
people and make it the best I can for them,'' she said. ``But I
don't have this reaction of sadness for them and why they have it.
I have become more detached. When I watch TV with my husband and
there's someone on who is paralyzed, he says, `That is really sad.'
I don't feel that way. I think it's something that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   She was increasingly comfortable with herself. One day, late in
her shift with nothing going on, she ventured across the street and
had her nails done. ``I had my beeper,'' she said. ``If anything
came up, I'd be right there.''

CELEBRATING A LONE STAR CHRISTMAS

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In San Antonio, they celebrate with luminarias on the River Walk
and re-enactments of Joseph and Mary's search for shelter. In
Galveston, it's a parade of lights _ at sea. And in San Angelo,
it's an Old West party, with campfire concerts and a military
parade.
</P>
<P>
   All over Texas, the holiday season is greeted with festivities,
from jolly to sacred, traditional to bohemian. So put off the
shopping, pack an overnight bag and bring home some holiday cheer
from one of our favorite celebrations:
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO: With luminarias glowing throughout downtown, San
Antonio rivals even Santa Fe for the Southwest's warmest, most
romantic feel in its deeply cultural celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Kicking off the nearly 100 events spread out over roughly a
month is the lighting of some 750,000 lights Nov. 20 on the
University of the Incarnate Word campus, followed Nov. 25 by the
illumination of legions of snowflake lights at the Witte Museum.
</P>
<P>
   The River Walk's profusion of lights twinkle to life Nov. 26,
when the annual river parade and lighting ceremony commences at 7
p.m. The same day, the Fort Worth Dallas Ballet and the San Antonio
Symphony begin a weekend run of ``The Nutcracker'' at the Lila
Cockrell Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   The city's rich Hispanic heritage inspires a wealth of
celebrations, starting with the Fiestas Navidenas, which will kick
off Nov. 27 with a mariachi celebration and the lighting of Market
Square. The same day, Pancho Claus arrives at Alamo Plaza and the
Guadalupe Players offer a mini-performance of Los Pastores, the
Christmas story in Spanish, at the Witte Museum.
</P>
<P>
   The Fiesta de las Luminarias, Dec. 3-5, 10-12 and 17-19, is the
candlelighting of the River Walk to symbolize the lighting of the
way for the Holy Family. That's not to be confused with Las Posadas
on Dec. 12; that's the candelighted re-enactment of Joseph and
Mary's search for shelter by the local conservation society at
historic La Villita. All of which is different from La Gran Posada
on Dec. 17, when parishioners of the extraordinary San Fernando
Cathedral downtown do another re-enactment, culminating with a
musical presentation and Mexican fiesta at the cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   For details on these events, as well as holiday home tours in
the King William district and stage productions, contact the San
Antonio Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau at (800) 447-3372 or visit
www.sanantoniocvb.com.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   GALVESTON: This Gulf Coast town gets right into the holiday swim
with its annual Harbor Parade of Lights on Nov. 27, when lighted
and decorated sail and power boats cruise through Galveston Harbor
after sunset. Celebrators can participate by riding on the Colonel,
a 19th-century-style paddle-wheeler that will dock at Pier 23, or
by watching along the Pier 21 dock. Details, Galveston Island
Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau, (888) 425-4753.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, Galveston's famous Strand historic district is
transformed into Victorian England for Dickens on the Strand, Dec.
4-5. Very merry revelers deck out in period clothing and jam the
streets to enjoy the old London-style markets by day and the
rollicking street-party scene at night. Expect everything from
handbell choirs and bagpipe bands to the queen's guard of
beefeaters to wizards and sword-swallowers. Info from the
historical foundation, (409) 765-7834.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES: For a holiday celebration honoring those from
Texas' Republic days, join in the Nine Flags Festival, Dec. 3-5 and
10-11, in this East Texas town. In addition to a lighted parade,
downtown marketplace, hayrides, candlelighted tour of Victorian
homes and afternoon tea, there will be a Texian Christmas at
Millard's Crossing, a village filled with authentic period
buildings, and Dickens storytelling in Oak Grove Cemetery, the
resting place of four signers of the Texas Declaration of
Independence. For details, call (888) 564-7351 or visit
www.visitnacogdoches.org.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   LA GRANGE: Texas' early German heritage is gift-wrapped for the
season at this Central Texas burg, where the Monument Hill and
Kreische Brewery State Historical Park is aglow, Dec. 4, 11, and
17-18. Costumed living-history actors take small tour groups along
lighted pathways in the evening through the decorated 3-story home,
built in the 1850s by master stonemason H.L. Kreische.
Wassail-sipping and pastry snacking are included. For reservations,
call (409) 968-5658.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   SAN ANGELO: Probably the most rugged of holiday settings is
found in this West Texas town, where the Concho Christmas
Celebration lasts from Dec. 3 till Dec. 31. Some 2 million lights
shine along the Concho River and throughout the vintage downtown
that first weekend, outlining pathways for walking and driving
tours.
</P>
<P>
   The month's activities include a cowboy campfire concert on Dec.
3, a Dec. 4 Asleep at the Wheel concert, a campfire breakfast Dec.
5 and period military parade ceremonies at the beautifully restored
Fort Concho National Historic Landmark, Dec. 3-5. All details can
be had from the convention and visitors bureau, (800) 375-1206.

   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   A baker's dozen of holiday happenings we can't resist:
</P>
<P>
   MARSHALL: Wonderland of Lights, Nov. 24-Dec. 30. How many
twinkling lights does it take to create a fairyland in the Harrison
County seat in East Texas? Would you believe 7 million? The county
historical museum and dozens of other buildings in this vintage
downtown are strung with more lights than the eye can comprehend.
Live entertainment adds to the merriment. (903) 935-7868.
</P>

 NEW YORK: right there.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   `Managed Care Is an Enemy' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The final weeks, there were parties and luncheons. Groups
gathered for after-hours drinks. ``Liver rounds,'' the interns
called them.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of course, there were year-end evaluations. Drs.
James, Lathan and Holland all received quite positive feedback. A
colleague went in for his, on the heels of several brutal days of
work, and the summation was he was ``average.'' He was crestfallen
and angry. He was weary to the bone and he was just average! He
told some of the others he might quit.
</P>
<P>
   Around the hospital, those completing their residencies pondered
the outside world, weighing dollars against geography. Over a
sandwich in the staff room, a senior resident told Dr. James:
``Doctors can make $50,000 to $60,000 more a year outside of New
York, because there aren't enough doctors there. But doctors want
to work in the city.'' He, too, wished to risk becoming part of the
local doctor glut.
</P>
<P>
   ``The young doctors I know in the city are starving,'' he said.
When he admitted a patient without a regular doctor, he always
referred him to one of the young physicians. ``You call them at 3
a.m., and they're actually happy to hear from you,'' he said.
``They don't snarl.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the interns ruminated more and more about what they would
do once their residencies ended. They felt early planning was
requisite in these baffling times.
</P>
<P>
   If insurers expected a teaching hospital like St.
Luke's-Roosevelt to groom a generation of doctors willing to obey
the managed-care mantra, that did not seem to be happening. In the
course of their year, all three of the interns, while appreciating
some of the waste excised from medicine, had become of a piece in
their increasing resistance to cost pressures and managed care.
</P>
<P>
   Holland had begun without strong feelings about managed care.
Now, he was sure he never wanted to work for an HMO: ``I don't want
to be part of a medical bureaucracy that seems to be ruining the
health care system of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   One particular episode framed his dismay. Needing to admit a
14-year-old boy with pneumonia, Holland had called the patient's
primary-care doctor. He said he didn't have privileges at St.
Luke's, and told him to call the managed-care plan. When Holland
reached a doctor who did have privileges, the man said he only
handled patients up to age 13 and shuttled him to still another
doctor, who informed him he only covered the East Side of
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm practically screaming at the guy,'' Holland said. ``On the
fourth or fifth doctor, I got someone who was able to approve it,
and he made an exception because he was actually an adult doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   Desiring a varied experience, Holland was mulling a mix of a
standard urban pediatric practice and shifts in an emergency room.
Two weeks a year would be reserved for something special: working
at a small hospital in rural Brazil set up by the grandfather of a
good friend from medical school.
</P>
<P>
   After his residency, Lathan contemplated a one-year fellowship
in disaster medicine and then a life traveling to earthquakes and
war zones. This had always been part of his dream, but it had
become even more enticing as a path to freedom from the vise of
managed care.
</P>
<P>
   He thought of the managed-care doctors he had to argue with:
``One guy said, `Why are you doing this to me? Are you going to
admit every patient you see tonight?' It wasn't about the patient.
It was about him. Managed care is an enemy. It's not a team player.
It's going to crash. It has to.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James had started out intending to become an HMO doctor on a
9-to-5 schedule. Not anymore. ``I don't think they're run well,''
she said of HMO's. ``And I want control. I never would have thought
about a private practice before.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, her desire was to have her own women's health practice. She
only wanted to see patients in the office; when they went to the
hospital, let doctors there care for them. ``I want to narrow
myself down to what I can be really good at,'' she said. ``I like
to do procedures, and I want to do a lot of procedures. But I don't
want to lose time running to the hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   It was her way of adapting to the new climate. ``My whole life
has been about dreaming up something and then going after it,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she and the others knew that their success as doctors
would also depend on how well they juggled money and resources, on
marketing savvy and an ability to compromise. They had landed in a
world that demanded doctors reassemble themselves to see 40 or 50
patients a day, a world of supersonic speed and diminishing
remuneration and respect. They were not blind to this, but if there
was one thing they felt they had got little of this first year, it
was any explicit coaching in how to master the abstruse economics
of doctoring. There seemed to be no time to teach them how best to
use their time.
</P>
<P>
   How much had they come to understand all the new cost pressures?
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe a little bit more,'' Dr. James said.
</P>
<P>
   What was clear was that the interns were drawing definite lines
between their lives and what they gave to patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm starting to value my life outside of medicine more than I
ever thought I would,'' Dr. James said. She felt happiest on days
when she had outside activities. ``I want to be a doctor,'' she
said, ``but I want to take my Rollerblade lessons. I want to have a
relationship with my husband. I want to have kids.''
</P>
<P>
   As Lathan put it: ``So much control has been taken away from us
in practicing medicine. My own life seems like the only thing
that's truly mine.''

 NEW YORK: truly mine.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A New Year, a New Role &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is how internship ends. With the dawning of July 1, a date
of ultimate significance only inside a teaching hospital, the three
interns, as if chameleons, automatically changed identities: They
officially became PGY-II's (postgraduate year 2), entrusted with
supervising the latest batch of interns, lording over the people
they were only yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect made them edgy, but they were truly tired of life
at the bottom of the food chain. As PGY-II's, they would no longer
write progress notes or do endless IV's and blood draws. ``They say
the second year you have more time to think,'' Holland said. ``One
senior resident put it like this: `The first year you do, the
second year you learn, the third year you teach.''' Their pay crept
up to $41,840 from $39,270, and there were small niceties. In the
on-call room where the pediatric residents rested was a bunk bed.
The bottom bunk was strictly for residents. The phone was not
reachable from the top. Two interns had actually tumbled off the
bunk in pursuit of a trilling phone. Holland could not wait to
sleep on the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   July 1 was thinly overcast, but the mood of the new PGY-II's was
joyous. ``Hey, Mr. Resident,'' they greeted one another. One
ex-intern said he was going for coffee. Dr. James quipped, ``Ah,
the luxury of the resident life.''
</P>
<P>
   On this important day, Holland found himself at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, doing a bone marrow transplant
rotation. Lathan had the day off, while Dr. James was in the St.
Luke's cardiac care unit.
</P>
<P>
   Morning rounds went at a speed uncompromised for the new
arrivals. The supervisor offered the platitude: ``It's like skating
on thin ice. Speed is stability.''
</P>
<P>
   As she cast an eye on the quizzical faces and listened to the
creaking voices of the new interns, Dr. James assured them the
anxiety would dissipate in the frenetic workload and the sweet
satisfaction of making people better. She doled out some logistical
pointers _ where the cafeteria was and the on-call room. She told
them to be sure to eat breakfast before they came on duty; on her
first day, several interns had fainted. (Her own predilection for
fainting notwithstanding, she had not been among them.)
</P>
<P>
   She mentioned certain anomalies, like having to write a
discharge summary even when a patient dies. Late in the year, she
had been told that she had four delinquent charts. They were all
dead patients who, she assumed, had been adequately processed by a
higher authority.
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty to do, malfunctioning hearts to be looked
after. Lunch carts rattled past. Dr. James moved merrily about the
murmuring floor, her dutiful intern clicking at her heels, and she
knew she was one step closer in this complicated process of
maturation and self-revelation, one step closer to a broader
understanding of what sort of doctor she would become in a system
under siege.
</P>
<P>
   She took a drink of water, swished it between her teeth. What
next? Her beeper went off. She reached for the phone. Her intern
watched. A new cycle was starting.

   In your holiday road-trip frenzy, don't forget to find a place
to stay. The chambers of commerce in each location will have ideas,
but here are some of our picks:
</P>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO: The Riverwalk Inn is a marked departure from the
mansion and cottage variations found near downtown. Here, an
assemblage of five 2-story log homes dating from 1842 and relocated
from Tennessee offer a total of 11 rooms _ named for Alamo heroes,
of course, with fireplaces and private baths. There's an expanded
continental breakfast in the morning, lemonade and cookies in the
afternoon, and dessert in the evening. Rooms start around $100. 329
Old Guilbeau St., (210) 212-8300 or (800) 254-4440.
</P>
<P>
   A wonderful spot for gastronomic restoration is El Mirador, 722
S. St. Mary's St., (210) 225-9444. Excellent soups and Tex-Mex
lunch plates are complemented by an evening selection of roasted
cabrito and grilled specialties.
</P>
<P>
   GALVESTON: Inn at 1816 Postoffice is a grand Victorian home that
was fastidiously renovated in 1995 for operation as a B&AMP;B. Elegant
furnishings, formal gardens and gourmet breakfasts make this an
island star. There are four rooms with private baths, and rates
begin at $125. 1816 Postoffice St., (409) 765-9444 or (888)
558-9444.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of blocks down, find gratifying eats in the form of
shrimp or beef empanadas, grilled shrimp and other Central American
delights at Rudy and Paco, 2028 Postoffice St., (409) 762-3696.
</P>
<P>
   LA GRANGE: You'll be glad you drove the 15 miles northwest from
La Grange via Texas 159 to The Settlement at Round Top. Among the
spread of 10 restored historic buildings are an 1830s log cabin
with a stone fireplace and a Civil War-period cottage with a parlor
stove and clawfoot tub. A full breakfast is included, and rates
start at $95. 2218 Hartfield Road in Round Top, (409) 249-5015 and
(888) ROUNDTOP.
</P>
<P>
   In La Grange, order fresh, crispy fried chicken and homemade pie
at the Bon Ton, 2359 Texas 71, (409) 968-8875. On the Round Top
square, dig into burgers, plate lunches, steaks and catfish at
Klump's, (409) 249-5696.
</P>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES: A retreat deep into the countryside and near Lake
Nacogdoches is Pine Creek Lodge, about 15 minutes west of town via
Farm Road 2782. A scattering of modern cabins filled with
hand-crafted wood furniture offer a lot of privacy and escapism.
Luxurious it's not, which appeals to those wary of lace and
antiques. A full breakfast is included; rates average about $100.
(409) 560-6282 and (888) 714-1414.
</P>
<P>
   For Mexican plates, steaks and chicken, head to La Hacienda, a
renovated 1913 home at 1411 North St., (409) 564-6450.
</P>
<P>
   SAN ANGELO: Hinkle Haus Bed &AMP; Breakfast at 19 S. Park St. offers
three bedrooms with private baths near the Concho River; (915)
653-1931. If that's full, try the Best Western, La Quinta or
Holiday Inn. Slake those hunger pangs with chicken-fried steaks and
rib-eyes at Zentner's Daughter Steak House, 1901 Knickerbocker
Ave., (915) 949-2821, or home-style enchiladas and tacos at Fuentes
Cafe, 9 E. Avenue K, (915) 658-4081.

PUERTO RICO REJECTS REFERENDUM ON TARGET RANGE  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Rossello on Tuesday abruptly
abandoned an agreement with President Clinton to allow residents of
the island of Vieques to vote on a White House plan to reopen part
of the island to Navy target practice.
</P>
<P>
   Rossello acted after his advisers warned him that the proposed
White House formulation for the ballot failed to give voters a
chance to support Rossello's position that the Navy must
permanently cease using the island's target range.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonso Aguilar, Rossello's spokesman in San Juan, said the
Democratic governor accepted the recommendation of his working
group after initially agreeing to the referendum plan in weekend
telephone discussions with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor and his working group believe there is enough
consensus on Vieques for the Navy to cease bombing and leave the
island so that no further civic consultation is needed,'' Aguilar
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rossello relayed his decision to Clinton in a telephone call
late Monday. Clinton is in Turkey, three days into a 10-day foreign
trip.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials had no immediate comment on Rossello's
change of heart.
</P>
<P>
   Flavio Cumpiano, a lawyer in Washington, D.C., representing
Puerto Rican groups opposed to the Navy's use of Vieques, said
Rossello's turnabout has triggered plans by opponents of Navy
operations to step up demonstrations on Vieques and across the
country on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The date, Nov. 19, marks the seven-month anniversary of the
accidental bombing that killed a Puerto Rican guard employed by the
Navy. The Navy suspended bombing after that tragedy and is urging
Clinton to allow the resumption of live-fire training there.
</P>
<P>
   Friday is also the anniversary of the day that Christopher
Columbus landed on Puerto Rico in 1493 on his second voyage to the
new world.
</P>
<P>
   Cumpiano criticized the proposed referendum because the options
didn't include asking voters whether the Navy should leave Vieques.
Instead, the only two options were whether to resume bombing or to
approve Clinton's plan to cut bombing to 90 days a year, shift to
non-explosive inert weapons and receive sizable increases in
economic assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``That formulation is completely unacceptable,'' Cumpiano said.
</P>
<P>
   Cumpiano added: ``The governor's misstep at this crucial stage
certainly doesn't help the cause. But we are united: if Rossello
sells the cause down the river, we still have popular support for a
permanent end to bombing and Navy withdrawal.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of Navy operations announced plans in San Juan on
Tuesday to move hundreds of demonstrators to the target range on
Vieques on Friday to join dozens of protesters encamped there since
April to thwart any resumption of bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Rallies also are planned on Friday in major cities across the
United States, including Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Md.; Los
Angeles; San Francisco; Hartford, Conn.; Boston, Cambridge, Mass.;
Amherst, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon, Navy Rear Adm. Craig Quigley, a defense
department spokesman, declined to discuss ongoing discussions
between the president and the governor of Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy is seeking an immediate White House go-ahead to enable
a Navy-Marine Corps battle group led by the aircraft carrier Dwight
D. Eisenhower to conduct live-fire training on Vieques in early
December before scheduled deployment for the Persian Gulf on Feb.
18.
</P>
<P>
   The 899-acre live fire impact area and an adjacent 11,000-acre
buffer zone and maneuver area have been closed since the April
accidental death of the security guard.
</P>
<P>
   The hilltop observation post is located at 10 miles from the
nearest of the island's 9,300 civilian residents.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley said while the Pentagon awaits the outcome of the
Clinton administration's discussions with Rossello, the Navy is
preparing to formally notify Puerto Rico of plans to conduct
live-fire training before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of a 1983 agreement, the Navy provides 15-days
notice to Puerto Rico when live-fire training is planned on
Vieques, located about eight miles off the eastern end of Puerto
Rico.

 &HT;    Georgia's wealthiest woman backs Bradley after break with Gore
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democrat Bill Bradley will visit Atlanta today to
talk about health care and attend his first Georgia fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley will speak to students and faculty at the Morehouse
School of Medicine this afternoon and to members of Atlanta's
Jewish community at the Atlanta Civic Center.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore, Bradley's rival for the Democratic nomination, is
making a vice presidential visit to the city this afternoon to
speak to the United Jewish Communities General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's fund-raiser will be held at the mansion of Anne Cox
Chambers, the state's richest resident, according to Forbes
magazine. In 1998, the magazine estimated her personal wealth at
$9.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers is chairman of Atlanta Newspapers, which owns The
Atlanta Journal-Constitution, and part owner of the companies that
comprise Cox Enterprises, one of the nation's largest, privately
held media conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers, who backed Gore's failed 1988 presidential bid, was
unavailable to talk about her reasons for supporting the former New
Jersey senator. Bradley met Chambers about a year ago through
mutual friends, according to his spokesman Eric Hauser.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers, an influential player inJimmy Carter's presidential
win in 1976, supported the Clinton-Gore ticket in early 1992. But
Chambers fell out with Gore in late 1992 over government regulation
of the cable television industry, a core component of the Cox
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was the Senate co-sponsor of legislation in 1992 that
mandated reductions in cable rates and forced cable companies to
share their programming with competitors. The cable industry
opposed the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue had to do just in general with the vice president's
attitude toward the cable industry and his attitude for regulatory
burdens in a climate in which Mrs. Chambers and others believed was
unwarranted,'' said Alexander Netchvolodoff, Cox's vice president
of public policy. ``I think she just got turned off.''
</P>
<P>
   The first public hint of the rupture occurred in May 1995 when
the Georgia Democratic Party invited Chambers to attend a
fund-raising event at what was then the Hotel Nikko. Gore flew in
from Washington to headline the dinner, which raised $75,000 for
the state party and Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers declined to attend the event in a pointed note to then
Gov. Zell Miller, said Steve Wrigley, Miller's chief of staff.
Chambers wrote that she could not support Gore given his views on
the cable television industry, he said. The May 1995 fund-raiser
also came in the midst of the second congressional battle over
cable television. All through 1995, congressional leaders and the
Clinton-Gore administration fought over what was to become the 1996
Telecommunications Act.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans argued that the bill, which dealt
extensively with the telephone industry, should also deregulate
cable companies. Gore and the administration fought that position,
arguing that the industry shouldn't be deregulated before cable had
more competition.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers and her sister, Barbara Cox Anthony, Cox's other major
stockholder, wrote several letters to the administration arguing
for deregulation, said Greg Simon, who was then Gore's senior
domestic policy adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cox sisters were one of a lot of people in the cable
industry who complained about our stand for consumers,'' Simon
said. Ultimately, the administration agreed to deregulate the
industry three years after the bill went into effect.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers' break with Gore has given Bradley a small opening in a
region of the country where he is less well-known than Gore and at
a decided political disadvantage. Georgia is also one of the 12
primary states that are packed together in a group to hold
primaries five weeks after the Feb. 1 New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers has done most of her political work at the national
party level. She contributed more than $200,000 to the DNC and
Democratic candidates since 1990 and has hosted several Democratic
fund-raisers at her home. She has been less active at the state
party level.
</P>
<P>
   The host for tonight's event is Chambers' daughter, Katharine
Rayner. Chambers, who gave $1,000 to Bradley in March, is in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few of the other Georgians who are on the host committee
have a record of giving to federal political candidates. Perhaps
the biggest names on the list are Holcombe Green, CEO of WestPoint
Stevens, and Bertis Downs, the Athens, Ga., attorney for Georgia
rock artists R.E.M.
</P>
<P>
   Green was a big backer of President Clinton in 1996 and he has
contributed more than $63,000 to Democratic parties and candidates
since 1992, including a $1,000 contribution to Bradley this year.
</P>
<P>
   State Democratic Rep. Terry Coleman, who is also a member of the
host committee, said sponsors hoped to raise $150,000 to $200,000
for Bradley.

IRISH LEADERS' WORDS AIMED AT RECONCILIATION

   BELFAST _ After centuries of hatred, division, and polarizing
bloodshed, Irish nationalists and unionists who want Northern
Ireland to remain British engaged in an unprecedented exercise of
mutual reassurance Tuesday as they prepared to break the impasse
that has stalled the peace process for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   In a pair of statements that are part of a carefully
orchestrated piece of confidence building, Ulster Unionist leader
David Trimble and Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams went out of their
way to give each other the political cover they need to sell a
compromise to their skeptical grass roots.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble said his party, which represents most Protestants in
Northern Ireland, is willing to drop its demand that the Irish
Republican Army turn in its weapons before unionists form a
power-sharing government with Catholic nationalists that will
include two Sinn Fein cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said that republicans, who for two centuries have
considered it their duty to use force to seek an independent and
united Ireland, accept that the turning in, or ``decommissioning,''
of IRA weapons ``is an essential part of the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams gave his most explicit repudiation of violence yet,
including a condemnation of vigilante beatings and shootings that
the IRA and its loyalist counterparts routinely use to police the
neighborhoods they control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are totally opposed to punishment attacks,'' Adams said.
``We are totally opposed to any use of force or threat of force by
others for any political purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a public repudiation of politically-motivated violence, and
of the ongoing IRA practice of punishment attacks, was considered
crucial as Sinn Fein seeks to convince unionists that it is
committed exclusively to democratic politics.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA is expected to issue its own statement, perhaps as early
as Wednesday endorsing the Sinn Fein statement and designating a
representative to meet retired Canadian General John de Chastelain,
who heads a commission overseeing the disarming of paramilitary
groups.
</P>
<P>
   The sequence of events that is supposed to lead to a break in
the impasse was choreographed by George Mitchell, the former US
senator from Maine who brokered the 1998 Good Friday Agreement and
has spent the last 10 weeks trying to save it from collapse.
</P>
<P>
   That agreement called for the creation of political institutions
to transform the conflict, over whether Northern Ireland should
remain part of the United Kingdom or merge with the Republic of
Ireland, from a violent to a political debate. But the process
effectively stalled 17 months ago when the unionists said they
would not sit in government with Sinn Fein until the IRA began
disarming, and the republicans countered that nothing in the
agreement linked creation of the government to decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
   After more than two months of patient coaxing by Mitchell,
however, Trimble on Monday indicated that he is willing to risk his
leadership by seeking his party's backing for the compromise that
drops the party's ``no guns, no government'' policy.
</P>
<P>
   If Trimble gets approval from a meeting of the 800-member party
council tentatively set for Nov. 27, the local government could be
formed within two weeks. It remains unclear when, or if, the first
IRA weapons would be turned in, though unionists want to see some
``product'' by January.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble Tuesday made what political observers here described as
the most conciliatory statement ever by a unionist leader aimed at
a Catholic nationalist audience. Unionists have historically
regarded nationalism as treason, and one of Trimble's predecessors
had once famously described Northern Ireland as ``a Protestant
state for a Protestant people.''
</P>
<P>
   But, standing in a cold drizzle on the steps of Castle Buildings
at Stormont, Trimble held out an olive branch, saying: ``The UUP
(Ulster Unionist Party) recognizes and accepts that it is
legitimate for nationalists to pursue their political objective of
a united Ireland by consent through exclusively peaceful and
democratic methods. The UUP is committed to the principles of
inclusivity, equality, and mutual respect on which the institutions
are to be based. It is our intention that these principles will
extend in practice to all areas of public life and be endorsed by
society as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Many republicans remain skeptical that unionists are prepared to
share power with them. Adams has argued that the only way to get
the IRA to turn in weapons is to implement the Good Friday
Agreement and show that politics offers an alternative to violence.
He reiterated that theme Tuesday, using what observers said was the
strongest language ever by a Sinn Fein leader to renounce violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an unprecedented opportunity to start afresh. An
opportunity to put behind us the failures, the tragedy and the
suffering of the past,'' Adams said. ``By providing an effective
political alternative we can remove the potential for conflict.
That conflict must be for all of us now a thing of the past, over,
done with, and gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The similar and conciliatory language used by Adams and Trimble
gave credence to suggestions that Mitchell's attempts to get the
two leaders to know each other better had produced empathy for each
other's position as they battle hardliners in their constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sinn Fein wishes to work with, not against, the unionists and
recognizes this as yet another imperative. For Sinn Fein,
cooperation and accommodation is the objective of this process,''
said Adams.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble said, ``We now have a chance to create a genuine
partnership between unionists and nationalists in a novel form of
government. It offers us the opportunity to put past failures
behind us.''

<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ The house is unremarkable, a modest gray
Craftsman bungalow on a shady side street a few blocks from the
University of California.
</P>
<P>
   You know, though, that a serious cook lives there the minute you
walk into the spacious, modern kitchen. Not that the room gleams
with marble and stainless steel like a designer's fantasy, or that
it's packed with gimmicks and gadgets, or that everything matches.
Utility is the hallmark here. A bright yellow La Cornue range
stands along one wall, and a big rectangular copper sink catches
the eye, but at heart, this is a kitchen made for cooking, not
looking.
</P>
<P>
   One Tuesday morning in early November, it was dressed for
autumn. Branches of red and orange and mottled yellow leaves filled
a handsome purple glass vase, along with blowsy Cafe au Lait
dahlias and yellow English Garden roses.
</P>
<P>
   The mistress of the house had laid out big bowls of pomegranates
and persimmons, walnuts and chestnuts, Ida Rose apples and Adriatic
figs and crab apples. Quinces, too, that someone had filched from
an old tree on a vacant lot nearby. A stalk of brussels sprouts lay
on the table, and a cabbage, a Platonic ideal of a cabbage, its
outer leaves unfurled into a sort of halo, sat on a metal stand.
</P>
<P>
   Food as still life, fit for a 17th-century Dutch master.
</P>
<P>
   An oak fire, lighted at 7 o'clock, had produced a fine bed of
coals beneath the plump hen turkey that was revolving on a stout
spit. Alice Waters (for it was she, in a long striped apron and
black chef's clogs) was rehearsing for Thanksgiving 1999, reaching
into the kitchen fireplace with a long branch of rosemary to baste
the browning bird with warm olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   Why a rosemary branch?
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?'' Ms. Waters replied. ``It's pretty, and it works
well, and it adds a bit of flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time I turned up to watch, along with my wife, Betsey,
two of Ms. Waters' longtime colleagues at Chez Panisse, the
influential Berkeley restaurant she has run since 1971, had joined
her. They were trimming vegetables with the short, sure strokes of
the professional that make amateurs like me so jealous. Both of
them _ Jean-Pierre Moulle, a bearded, soft-spoken native of the
Charente region in southwestern France, and Fritz Streiff, a
Harvard man who wears Philip Johnson glasses _ have helped her to
establish the restaurant's worldwide reputation for extraordinarily
fresh, organically grown raw materials, cooked simply and superbly
in a hybrid Italo-Franco-Californian style.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first real day of fall,'' Moulle said. In the
backyard garden, pomelos and Meyer lemons still hung from the
trees, and exactly four raspberries fought against time on a bush
near the guest cottage, but there was a nip in the air that the
bright sunshine could not quite dispel.
</P>
<P>
   As they worked, the three cooks chatted about the provenance of
the ingredients that would go into Ms. Waters' Thanksgiving feast.
The unusually fine-leaved escarole and the fabulously peppery
watercress for the salad had been grown by Bob Cannard in the
Valley of the Moon in Sonoma County, northwest of Berkeley. The
sourdough bread had come, of course, from the Acme Bakery just a
few blocks away, one of the cluster of establishments that have
flourished here since the food revolution began 30-odd years ago.
The vegetables had come from various farmers' markets, and the
cranberries for the upside-down cake baked by the restaurant's
pastry chef, Charlene Reis, from the Ladybug Cooperative in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have, would have, should have made the cake, if I'd
had the time,'' volunteered Ms. Waters, an intense, pale-skinned
woman who was once a Montessori teacher. ``It's easy enough for
even me to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The cranberries really slayed me. You have to be a bit of a
maniac to conceive of organic cranberries, let alone find them, and
Ms. Waters pleaded guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you go to extremes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She has gone so far as to hire a forager, Alan Tangren, who
searches not only for wild nettles and the like in back yards, but
also for unlikely suppliers like the Ladybug Co-Op.
</P>
<P>
   What about the turkey? I asked.
</P>
<P>
   Blank looks. Eager to give credit to all her suppliers, as she
always does on Chez Panisse's menus, Ms. Waters made an urgent
telephone call to the restaurant. It turned out that Ms. Turkey, a
13-pounder, had been raised on the Diestel Ranch, a small farm on
the outskirts of Sonora, a town not far from Yosemite National
Park. The bird had grown up, Ms. Waters emphasized, not in a cage,
but free to roam, eating grass and other vegetation innocent of
pesticides, herbicides and artificial fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
   Using a method she developed several years ago, Ms. Waters
soaked the turkey for 72 hours in a well-seasoned brine before
cooking it. Doing so, she said, helps keep the bird moist, and when
we tucked into it later, it was a juicy revelation. Even the
thinnest slices of white meat held together without crumbling,
which is more than you can say for most of the turkeys I have
cooked (or eaten) in the last few centuries. The marination also
added subtle overtones of herby, spicy flavor to a bird that, let's
face it, can taste bland as blancmange.
</P>
<P>
   The turkey was stuffed with a mixture of bread, herbs and wild
mushrooms, chiefly golden chanterelles. Chanterelle stems, a few
chestnuts, poultry stock and the turkey giblets went into a silky
sauce.
</P>
<P>
   ``It works perfectly in an oven,'' Ms. Waters said, ``but I'd
rather cook over a fire when I can. I have a fascination with fires
_ the flavors, the aromas, the primal quality of the process. I'm a
rotisseuse at heart. Some people can make sauces. They're
comfortable at the stove, but this is me, here, in front of the
flames, roasting.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Moulle, a keen hunter, suggested that the brining method would
be especially well suited to wild turkey, which is even more prone
to desiccation during conventional cooking than domesticated birds.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, Moulle and his wife, Denise, and a dozen or so
others assemble for Thanksgiving with Ms. Waters at the house of
Jay and Pam Heminway, her longtime friends, which is set amidst
mountain vineyards in the Chiles Valley, northwest of the Napa. But
the Moulles will miss this year's celebration. It will take place a
continent away, at the Heminways' house in Watch Hill, R.I., so
that Ms. Waters can be with her daughter, Fanny, 16, who is
attending the Mountain School at Vershire, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about the change of venue, Ms. Waters said, would
be East Coast oysters, which she prefers to those of the West
Coast. Some other ingredients, she said, she would take with her
from Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Thanksgiving has always been a big deal for Ms. Waters, and it
has always involved a big crowd. Growing up in Chatham, N.J., she
recalled, ``that was the one time of the year when my parents had a
big party'' _ the one time they put all the leaves in the table and
asked 15 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rest of the year, my mother never made real desserts, like
pumpkin pie,'' she said. ``The rest of the year it was fruit
cups.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Always friends' wines on holidays,'' Ms. Waters said as we
started our early Thanksgiving meal with a cool glass of Chateau La
Louviere 1990, a white Bordeaux made by Mrs. Moulle's father, Andre
Lurton. Later on, with the turkey, we _ the cooks, Mrs. Moulle and
the two of us _ drank a bottle of the Heminways' lean Red and Green
Vineyards zinfandel 1998, rather reminiscent of Tuscany, and
Lurton's Chateau Dauzac 1985, a fifth-growth Margaux. A bottle of
Dauzac 1978 materialized with the cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody went to the table for the first course. In the European
manner, it was the most luxurious part of the meal. We stood around
or sat on kitchen stools to nibble on four kinds of oysters,
freshly opened and set atop a mound of shaved ice and seaweed _
Wellfleets from Cape Cod and Kumamotos, Hog Islands and
thumbnail-size Olympias from the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   With those came pork sausages, purposely made with little
seasoning other than a bit of white wine, so their blandness would
contrast with the coppery, briny taste of the oysters. The
combination is traditional not only in France but also in
Tidewater, Va., as my wife reminded me.
</P>
<P>
   Then came slices of a terrine of foie gras, made by Moulle from
Sonoma County duck livers and served on slices of sourdough toast
hot from a grill in the fireplace.
</P>
<P>
   And then came bagna cauda, an Italian dip for raw vegetables
that is also served in Provence. It is made from olive oil, garlic
and anchovies pounded in a mortar, and the anchovies, packed in
salt in Sicily in a big round can, provided the morning's only
crisis, however transitory.
</P>
<P>
   Cans are uncommon denizens of Ms. Waters' kitchen, and Streiff,
one of Ms. Waters' collaborators on the new ``Chez Panisse Cafe
Cookbook'' (HarperCollins, $34), could not for the life of him find
an opener. Neither could Moulle. But Ms. Waters rummaged around on
a shelf and came up with one, an ancient lever-action model, rusty
but serviceable.
</P>
<P>
   The vegetable plate that accompanied the bagna cauda won the
prize, everyone agreed, for sheer good looks _ purple radishes,
deep red and light green radicchio, scarlet strips of bell pepper,
brilliant orange carrot curls, and paler celery, turnips and
artichoke hearts. The sauce tasted even better, I thought, sopped
up with a chunk of an Acme Bakery baguette.
</P>
<P>
   After three hours, the turkey was done, its ivory skin now
richly dappled.
</P>
<P>
   While it rested for a few minutes, the three cooks applied the
finishing touches to the vegetables, taking care, as they had all
day, to drop small scraps into a plastic pail for composting and
bigger leftovers into a basket, to be taken to the restaurant for
use in the stockpot.
</P>
<P>
   The striking thing about the whole meal was the absence of sugar
and cream, which are omnipresent in many Thanksgiving dinners. Even
the cranberry cake was tart-sweet, unlike pecan or pumpkin pie.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of sweet potatoes, Ms. Waters served a puree of potatoes
and parsnips, boiled separately, then mashed together with a little
milk and very little butter. The other vegetable, braised fennel,
was prepared in an equally straightforward, equally satisfying way:
the fennel bulbs, cut into pieces, were stewed in a little water
and olive oil, and the feathery tops, chopped, were stirred in at
the last minute as a flavor-booster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like desserts with a little bit of a tart edge,'' she said.
``Richness is not what it's about. Cream overwhelms the taste of
vegetables, so I like to cook them in olive oil, the way the
Italians do, braising and stewing to bring out the vegetables' own
flavor. This isn't a health issue. It's a flavor issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The oval table in front of the kitchen fireplace table was set
in a minute or two with big, utilitarian napkins, sturdy cutlery,
pretty Deruta plates and a pair of well-worn brass candlesticks. A
food stylist might not have approved, but we eager eaters thought
it looked just right.
</P>
<P>
   Streiff popped a new disk of Vivaldi songs by Cecilia Bartoli
onto the stereo, and we went to work on our meal. The soprano's
swooping vocal line prompted talk of opera at Salzburg, the
director Peter Sellers, the Telluride Film Festival in Colorado,
the Adelaide festival in Australia and, somehow, eating in Naples.
</P>
<P>
   By then we had reached the salad, a great pile of airy greens on
each diner's plate, the dressing light but garlicky.
</P>
<P>
   The cheese _ a whole-milk Vacherin from the Jura, whose peak
season happily coincides with Thanksgiving _ came with music from
the Russian soprano Edita Gruberova. Last, the cake _ slim little
pieces, not much room left _ and glasses of tea made from spearmint
from the garden.
</P>
<P>
   None of us could have asked for a more delicious or more
celebratory holiday meal, and I got up from the table, I must
confess, feeling a great deal less laden than I usually do on the
final Thursday in November.

   BRINE-CURED ROAST TURKEY
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from Alice Waters
</P>
<P>
   Time: 4 hours and 15 minutes, plus 72 hours for brining  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   } cup plus 2 tablespoons kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   } cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 carrot, peeled and diced
</P>
<P>
   1 large onion, peeled and diced
</P>
<P>
   \ cup diced celery
</P>
<P>
   1 leek, white and light green parts only, cleaned and diced
</P>
<P>
   2 bay leaves
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon black peppercorns
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon coriander seeds
</P>
<P>
   \ teaspoon red pepper flakes
</P>
<P>
   \ teaspoon fennel seeds
</P>
<P>
   2 star anise
</P>
<P>
   2 or 3 sprigs fresh thyme
</P>
<P>
   1 12- to 14-pound naturally fed, free-range turkey
</P>
<P>
   Wild Mushroom Stuffing (see recipe) or other stuffing
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons olive oil or butter
</P>
<P>
   Fresh rosemary branches, optional.
</P>
<P>
   1. In 16-quart or larger stockpot, bring 2 gallons water to a
boil. Add salt and sugar, and stir until completely dissolved. Turn
off heat, and add carrot, onion, celery and leek. Add bay leaves,
peppercorns, coriander, red pepper, fennel seeds, star anise and
thyme. Refrigerate until cold.
</P>
<P>
   2. Remove giblets from turkey. Cover and refrigerate liver if
using in stuffing. Discard remaining giblets or reserve for another
use. Add turkey to stockpot. If necessary, weight it with a plate
so that it stays below the brine's surface. Refrigerate for 72
hours, then remove from brine and allow to come to room
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   3. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Loosely fill the turkey at both
ends with stuffing, and truss as you would a chicken.
</P>
<P>
   4. Place turkey in a large roasting pan, and roast until it
starts to brown, about 25 minutes. Reduce oven setting to 350
degrees, and roast for 12 minutes more per pound, until internal
temperature at deepest part of the leg reaches 130 degrees. (Total
roasting time will be about 3 hours.) Baste frequently with olive
oil or butter and pan juices, using rosemary branches as a brush if
desired. If the bird begins to darken too much, cover it loosely
with a piece of foil. Before serving, remove turkey from oven and
leave covered with foil. Allow it to rest for 20 minutes before
carving and spooning the stuffing into a serving dish. Yield: 15
servings.
</P>
<P>
   WILD MUSHROOM STUFFING
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes

and the remaining garlic. Saute until softened, about 3 minutes.
Season with salt and pepper to taste, and add to the bowl of

<P>
   3. Return skillet to medium heat, and add bacon. Cook until
crisp, then remove bacon (discard or save for another purpose),
saving fat. Add diced liver to pan, and saute over medium heat
until browned, about 2 minutes. Drain well, season with salt and
pepper to taste, and add to mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
   4. In a large mixing bowl, combine bread cubes and enough milk
to saturate them. Drain bread, squeezing gently. Add to mushrooms,
and mix gently. Add herbs and mix again. If desired, add egg to
bind stuffing.

 &HT;    Home Depot's profit tops estimates
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Home Depot's third-quarter profit rose 46 percent,
helped in part by higher-priced goods and services.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street responded to Tuesday's news by nudging the stock up
$1 to $79.75.
</P>
<P>
   Several other companies, including Dayton Hudson, Limited and
Staples, also reported better-than-expected quarterly profits as a
strong economy fueled sales across the retail sector.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterly sales for Cobb County-based Home Depot rose to $573
million, or 37 cents a share, from $392 million, or 26 cents a
share, in the year-ago period. The retailer beat analysts'
expectations by 2 cents a share, according to a survey by First
Call.
</P>
<P>
   Third-quarter sales totaled $9.88 billion, an increase of 28
percent from $7.7 billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Sales at stores open at least one year rose 10 percent from the
same period last year, topping the retailer's forecast for a gain
in the high single digits. Same-store sales are a key retail
indicator because they exclude sales from new and closed stores.
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth quarter, Home Depot expects same-store sales to
rise by a high single-digit rate, Chief Administrative Officer Ron
Brill said during a conference call. He was not more specific.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strength of the core business is providing us with the
opportunity to invest in future growth, inside and outside the Home
Depot stores,'' Brill said. Growth vehicles outside the core
warehouse realm include Expo Design Center, Villager's Hardware and
installation services.
</P>
<P>
   Sales growth in the third quarter was driven by pricier decor
items, flooring, tool rentals and installations, Brill said. Home
Depot also continued to review its merchandise mix and weed out
unprofitable products.
</P>
<P>
   The average sale was $48.75, up from $45.62 in the year-ago
period. Average weekly sales per store rose to $879,000 from
$847,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gross margin, which measures the amount of profit from each
sale, widened to 29.3 percent from 28.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   During the third quarter, Home Depot opened 32 stores, including
its first in Hawaii and its third site in Santiago, Chile. The
company ended the period with 878 stores.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot plans to open 51 stores in the fourth quarter,
including a second Villager's Hardware store in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   A replay of Home Depot's conference call with analysts is
available for five days at the company's Web site at
www.homedepot.com.

CLINTONS CONSOLE EARTHQUAKE VICTIMS IN TURKEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Spelling of `Clintion' in 7th graf cq.) 
(nk) 
 By MARC LACEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ It was a familiar scene: President Clinton
consoling disaster victims, promising a swift rebuilding effort and
pledging federal assistance. The difference Tuesday was that the
disaster in question struck halfway around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Using the same approach he employs after hurricanes, tornadoes
and other disasters close to home, Clinton visited a tent city
about 50 miles east of Istanbul, the Turkish capital, that was set
up for survivors of the earthquake that struck in August, killing
more than 17,000. Another earthquake on Friday struck Duzce, 115
miles east of Istanbul, killing 547 people and injuring 3,300, the
Turkish government said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a camp inhabited by 9,000 victims on the outskirts of the
town of Izmit, Clinton bounced a baby in his arms, sipped Turkish
coffee in one family's tent and listened attentively as survivors
described their struggles in the aftermath of the quake.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the most difficult thing about living in this tent?''
Clinton asked a woman holding an infant inside her living quarters.
She complained of the cold weather outside and humidity inside. The
green military-style tent, normally used to shelter 10 soldiers,
had become the temporary home for 17 members of the Gencenler
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're grateful for you letting us into your home,'' Clinton
said as he exited. As a steady rain fell, he strolled through the
encampment with his wife, Hillary, and the Clintons' daughter,
Chelsea. At one point Chelsea held a 2-year-old boy named Betul in
her lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a beam fall and the next thing I knew I awoke in the
hospital,'' Ismail Yoldas, the father of three children, told the
Clintons of the moment the August earthquake struck. Yoldas
expressed his ``honor and happiness to meet the president.'' His
twin daughters smiled and answered yes when Mrs. Clinton asked if
they liked the makeshift school set up in the camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to Clintion,'' said a hand-painted sign written by a
young boy in the kindergarten tent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children of America are thinking of you,'' Clinton told
the 20 youngsters packed inside for lessons. After a brief
translation from the teacher, the children thanked Clinton in
unison and then sang a Turkish children's song about a little bird.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reassured the earthquake survivors who excitedly
surrounded him that the American government would pitch in to help
them rebuild their lives. Already, the United States has donated
$14.5 million as well as thousands of tents, blankets, rolls of
plastic sheeting and portable latrines. In a grim reminder of the
earthquake's wrath, the U.S. government has also shipped 10,000
body bags.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could imagine what our lives would be like if such a thing
were to happen to us, as we have seen it happen to families in the
United States,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of last week's second earthquake further east
in Duzce, Clinton said, an additional 500 military tents were sent
along to provide thousands of victims with shelter through the
winter.
</P>
<P>
   To promote rebuilding efforts in both quake sites, Clinton said
that the Federal Emergency Management Agency would help train local
officials in disaster response and that the Export-Import Bank
would extend $1 billion in loan guarantees to companies that invest
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also used the earthquake, one aide said, to engage in
``seismic diplomacy'' to try to ease regional tensions. Large
earthquakes in both Turkey and Greece have prompted unprecedented
cooperation between the long-antagonistic states, a process that
Clinton said had created ``a genuine opportunity for fundamental
and enduring reconciliation between your two lands.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On the third day of a 10-day swing through southeastern Europe,
Clinton used every chance he could to encourage Turks to put past
animosities aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were so impressed that a total of 87 other countries came
forward to help the people of Turkey who were hurt in the
earthquake,'' Clinton told a gathering of quake survivors and
relief workers after his tour of Izmit. ``And we were very grateful
that one of the countries that came forward to help was your
neighbor, Greece. And then, when the Greeks had their earthquake,
the Turkish people came forward to help them.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's main message to the victims was similar to the one he
delivers at every disaster scene, whether it is a North Carolina
town ravaged by a hurricane, a string of communities in Arkansas
leveled by a tornado or a distant nation ravaged by a killer quake.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will stay with you and work with you,'' Clinton said. ``I
just want to urge you to keep your spirits up, keep the smiles on
your children's faces, keep helping the people who lost their loved
ones in the earthquake and know that together we will get through
this to better days.''

   COPELAND-2000 (Undated) _ Aaron Copland, born in a tenement flat
two floors above the dry goods store his Jewish Lithuanian father
ran in Brooklyn, N.Y., would have been 100 on November 14 next
year. And the country Copland loved, the only country he ever felt
comfortable in, with the possible exception of Mexico, has already
started the party. Some 200 events, presented by institutions
ranging from the Philadelphia Orchestra, to Martha Graham Dance
Company, to the U.S. Army Field Band, to the Etowah Youth Orchestra
in Gasden, Alabama will be part of an international commemoration
called ``Copland 2000,'' spearheaded by the composer's ever
vigilant and eternally grateful publishing house, Boosey &AMP; Hawkes.
By Anthony Tommasini.

<P>
   MODERN-MUSEUM-ART (New York) _ ``Modern Starts: People, Places
and Things,'' is the first of three enormous shows with which the
Museum of Modern Art is fanning the siecle, as it were, while also
examining its unparalleled collection and the way it has
historically been shaped and presented. (``Places'' and ``Things''
are on view through March 14, ``People'' through Feb. 1.) With some
additions fore and aft, ``Modern Starts,'' concentrates on
1880-1920 (the second part, opening in March, looks at 1920-1960;
the third, which arrives next fall, at 1960-2000.) Its organizing
team, headed by John Elderfield, chief curator-at-large, and Peter
Reed, the curator of the department of design and architecture,
decided to abandon the familiar narrative, or any narrative at all,
and let art history take the hindmost. By Roberta Smith.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   HOFFMAN-FILMS (Undated) _ Philip Seymour Hoffman, 32, the stocky
blond character actor from the suburbs of Rochester, N.Y., who at
the moment seems a candidate to become the last hot actor of the
20th century. OK, OK, that's sort of a trick; the clock is ticking
fast, and there's no new Skeet Ulrich with a film about to pop out
of the pipeline, and being the last anything of the century is
quite a matter of chance. But it is true that Hoffman is going to
end the year in sensational style, appearing in three
buzz-generating movies _ along with ``Flawless,'' in which he
appears opposite Robert De Niro, he is in Paul Thomas Anderson's
``Magnolia'' and Anthony Minghella's ``The Talented Mr. Ripley.''
Hoffman is not likely to cop a People magazine cover in the next
couple of weeks, but by January, an awful lot of people are going
to know who he is. By Jamie Malanowski.
</P>
<P>
   DIGITAL-VIDEO-DISC (Undated) _ It's odd about DVD. With three
million players in use, the digital video disc has emerged as the
fastest growing format ever, and that includes the audio CD and the
videocassette. Yet, according to one industry study, 40 percent of
the American public doesn't know what DVD is. By Peter M. Nichols.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PRICE-THEATER (New York) _ Though I saw the original production
of Arthur Miller's ``The Price'' with Pat Hingle and Arthur Kennedy
as the brothers, I have no memory of being as moved and as
peculiarly cheered by it as I was by the current production. As
staged at the Royal Theater by James Naughton (a Tony winner for
his grand performance as Billy Flynn in ``Chicago'', this
``Price,'' like Michael Mayer's recent production of ``A View From
the Bridge,'' realizes all of the text's dangerous tensile
strength. It is both immensely satisfying and, in a way that
straight plays are not often cited for, entertaining. By Vincent
Canby.
</P>
<P>
   LION-KING-THEATER (London) _ Of all the current theater plays in
London, what has left even The Sunday Times's intellectually
rigorous John Peter crying ``wonderful, wonderful'' is Julie
Taymor's restaging of her Broadway production of Disney's ``Lion
King'' at the Lyceum Theater: a judgment confirmed by reports that
the show is booking until next September and that some Londoners
are mortgaging their mothers to meet the prices the scalpers are
asking for seats. By Benedict Nightingale.
</P>
<P>
   TOGETHER-THEATER (New York) _ Bob Morris talks with Carol
Burnett and Ruthie Henshall, who are appearing together in the
revue ``Putting It Together,'' which opens Sunday at the Ethel
Barrymore Theater in a new production of the Stephen Sondheim song
collection.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BALLET-HISPANICO (New York) _ When Tina Ramirez established the
Ballet Hispanico school and company in 1970, it was a revolutionary
act. Hispanics not only had few dance schools, they also had
trouble getting into dance companies, an almost unimaginable
situation now with the dazzling Hispanic dancers in mainstream
ballet and modern companies. This fall Ms. Ramirez and her
groundbreaking enterprise won two major honors. In September, she
received the Hispanic Heritage Award for Education at the Kennedy
Center in Washington. Since its founding, almost 10,000 children
have studied at the Ballet Hispanico School, which now enrolls 600
students yearly for classes in Spanish, modern and jazz dance and
ballet. By Valerie Gladstone.
</P>
<P>
   AMERICAN-DANCE (Undated) _ There could be little argument that
``A Celebration of 100 Years of American Dance on Film'' was one of
the most wildly improbable dance events of 1999. But the program
also suggested profound changes in the nature of dance in America,
and in the relationship between dance and the electronic media. By
Jennifer Dunning.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   FELDMAN-MUSIC (Undated) _ After the Flux Quartet's recent
premiere performance of Morton Feldman's String Quartet No. 2 in
its complete six-hour version, the three orchestral works on a new
Feldman disc seem like Webernian essays in atomistic compression.
Feldman wrote few works for orchestra, yet in the three works here
_ ``Coptic Light,'' ``Piano and Orchestra'' and ``Cello and
Orchestra'' (Argo 448 513-2; CD) _ the more varied palette provides
an ideal entry point into his unique sound world, less daunting and
ascetic than the composer's chamber music. By Lawrence A. Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MIDNITE-VULTURES-ALBUM (Undated) _ Laughter is the immediate
response to most of the songs on Beck Hansen's fifth album,
``Midnite Vultures'' _ so much so that it could be called a comedy
record. But it's a comedy record in the sense that intelligent
directors make comedy films: it's one big aesthetic disposition,
rather than the series of bulletlike jokes on what are commonly
called comedy records by the likes of Adam Sandler and Chris Rock.
``Midnite Vultures'' is funny without making actual jokes. By Ben
Ratliff.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIAL-ART (Undated) _ Millennial thinking resonates through
American politics, from Manifest Destiny to the ``vision thing''
any presidential hopeful is still required to spin out. It has
always been there in high art: in the nationalist allegories of
Hudson River School landscape painting, in Social Realism with its
demand for a new order, in Abstract Expressionism with its
commitment to the sublime. And nowhere is millennialism more
consistently explored than in vernacular culture. This fact makes
``Millennial Dreams: Vision and Prophecy in American Folk Art,''
organized by Gerald C. Wertkin at the Museum of American Folk Art
through May 14, one of the few genuinely timely museum offerings of
the season. By Holland Cotter.
</P>
<P>
   MUFFLER-MEN-ART (Los Angeles) _ Produced by mechanics in the
shops where they work, muffler men are being made as advertising
art, proliferating as roadside attractions outside the shops
throughout the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Their makers _ most
are Hispanic _ repaint them frequently to keep them looking shiny
new. But they weather fast, lasting for no more than a couple of
years. So far, very few figures appear to have survived long enough
to show up in flea markets and art shows, and that may explain why
most people have no idea what muffler men are. Now muffler men are
moving into the world of art. In an exhibition at the Fowler Museum
of Cultural History at the University of California at Los Angeles,
``Muffler Men, Munecos and Other Welded Wonders,'' is the first
museum exhibition devoted entirely to these figures. On display
through April 28 are 34 metal images of people, space creatures and
animals. By Rita Reif.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-MARY-AND-RHODA (New York) _ From 1970 to 1977, as Mary
Richards and Rhoda Morgenstern, Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie Harper
made ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' one of the most successful
series in television history. Now they are back together making
``Mary and Rhoda,'' an ABC television movie that began as an idea
for a series and may yet lead to one. In the film, Mary and Rhoda
reconnect in New York, where they both have daughters in college.
By Peter M. Nichols.
</P>
<P>
   NY-RADIO (New York) _ As the WNYC radio station celebrates its
75th anniversary, it faces not only continued high payments for its
broadcasting license but a backbreaking 200 percent hike in charges
from National Public Radio for syndication of several programs,
including the acclaimed news and feature series ``Morning Edition''
and ``All Things Considered.'' The miracle is that they seem to be
pulling it off. By Valerie Gladstone.

 &HT;    National League MVP award likely to go to Atlanta's JonesBy
Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Braves' MVP fraternity is tiny but expanding. Its
newest pledge should be inducted today, when Chipper Jones is
expected to become only the sixth Brave named National League MVP.
</P>
<P>
   Jones stands a chance to win by the largest margin this decade.
24 voters in the Baseball Writers' Association surveyed informally,
twenty-one said they had voted Jones first on their ballots.
Thirty-two writers vote for the award, two from each National
League city.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's Jeff Bagwell might have been the favorite in July, but
Jones probably won the award when the Mets played in Atlanta in
September. They surrendered four hits to him, all outcome-dictating
home runs, in a three-game sweep that all but secured the Braves'
eighth division title in a row.
</P>
<P>
   But that series was just the exclamation point on a season in
which Jones hit the most Braves home runs since Hank Aaron. After
an offseason that was scarred by his dissolved marriage and that
preceded the final year on his contract, Jones had the kind of
season that made his boyhood baseball idol, Dale Murphy, proud.
Facing added pressure with each injury the Braves endured, Jones
gave them an offensive hero they had not seen this side of Terry
Pendleton, who helped start this decade long run in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Today, all four of those Braves will have something more in
common.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize how special it was until later on,'' said
Aaron, who won his only MVP award in 1957 at age 23.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron, when he got the call that he had won the award, was in a
hotel room in Chicago doing his offseason work of public relations
for Miller Brewing Co. Jones will sacrifice an afternoon of golf,
fishing or hunting today to address the media.
</P>
<P>
   But despite 42 years of the changes in major-league baseball,
the award means the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means you're the best in the league,'' Aaron said. ``You've
had the greatest year of any player that year. . . . I don't think
anyone was close to Chipper, as far as I was concerned, putting
together a complete year in all categories.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones became the first player in major-league history to hit
.300, score 100 runs, hit 40 home runs and 40 doubles, draw 100
walks and steal 20 bases. Jones had career-bests with a .319
batting, 45 home runs, 126 walks and 25 steals. He finished in the
top 10 in the National League in 10 major offensive categories and
set a new National League record for home runs in a season by a
switch-hitter, surpassing Todd Hundley's 41 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Both Aaron and Murphy agreed that the most impressive statistic
of the switch-hitter's season came in his power numbers from the
right side. In his first four major-league seasons, Jones had 12
homers from the right side. This year, under the tutelage of Don
Baylor, who was hitting coach, Jones had 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've watched enough to know Don Baylor helped him
tremendously,'' Murphy said. ``His right-handed production _ what
an incredible jump. It's a sign he's teachable, he wants to
learn.''
</P>
<P>
   After a relatively quiet June, an All-Star snub and a second
significant blow to the Braves lineup with the loss of Javy Lopez,
Jones heated up. He hit .413 with 11 homers in July and .336 with
10 homers and 23 RBIs in August.
</P>
<P>
   He had 69 RBIs in his last 94 games to raise his one lagging
statistic and become the first Brave to post four-consecutive
100-RBI seasons since Murphy, 1982-85.
</P>
<P>
   Jones reached base in an Atlanta-record 39 consecutive games,
spanning the entire month of July and half of August. He matched an
NL record by drawing walks in 16 consecutive games, in late August
and early September. Five times this season, he won extra-inning
games with a home run. He led the National League by hitting .367
from the seventh inning on.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Jones played 157 games at the demanding position
of third base.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron predicted that Jones' future will be as an outfielder.
``That's when you'll see a real offensive explosion,'' he said. But
wherever Jones is on the field, both Murphy and Aaron have a
feeling that he will be in this MVP position again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember meeting him when he first signed,'' Murphy said.
``Everybody said the same thing about me _ man, he's skinny. He's
just a skinny, high school kid. But he's worked hard,'' Murphy
said. ``He's certainly earned this. He has a lot of talent, but he
wants to improve and he loves to play the game. That kind of
combination will be exciting to watch. He's already fun to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is the first time he'll have this
opportunity.''

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Taking a slightly darker turn into, um, doll psychology proves
something of an inspiration for ``Toy Story 2.'' In this follow-up
to the first all-computer-animated feature, the talking toys are
more neurotic, more desperate for children's affection and
irreparably damaged inside by surface injuries, even when the
latter can be fixed.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sublimely silly strategy for a kids' movie that, coupled
with the ever-expanding graphic capabilities of industry leader
Pixar Animation, makes for supremely clever comedy. And even adults
might be touched as deeply as their tots by the film's moments of
true anthropomorphic poignance.
</P>
<P>
   Plastic has never been so affecting.
</P>
<P>
   A toy's joy, not to mention its purpose, is to be played with,
and the idea of that being curtailed is the source of much anxiety
here. It begins with our old pardner, Woody the stuffed cowboy
(voiced by Tom Hanks), frantically searching his owner Andy's room
for his missing hat. Andy is about to take off for summer camp, and
his favorite plaything can't wait to go along _ until a last-minute
arm tear gets Woody shelved.
</P>
<P>
   As if this isn't devastating enough, Woody is soon kidnapped by
Al McWhiggin (Wayne Knight), proprietor of Al's Toy Barn and an
over-age collector. He takes Woody to his penthouse lair _ in an
art deco tower conspicuously marked No Children Allowed _ where the
terrified toy soon discovers that ... he's a star! Yes, the
long-gone 1950s puppet show ``Woody's Roundup'' generated scads of
merchandise and, as part of a complete set, Woody is now an
invaluable collectors item.
</P>
<P>
   Woody meets his onetime stablemates Jessie (Joan Cusack), a
high-spirited, storage-fearing cowgirl; Bullseye the happy horse;
and Stinky Pete the prospector (Kelsey Grammer), still in his
original packaging and, though affable, warped by never having
known a child's love. These new friends convince Woody to be
perfectly sanguine about Al's plans to sell them to a toy museum in
Japan, where they'll be admired, if not played with, by generations
of kids, not outgrown by a single, ungrateful one.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, meanwhile ... space ace Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen)
leads an expedition of Potato Heads and Slinkys to save his friend.
Among other adventures, Andy's toys cross busy city streets and
make their way through elevator shafts. Most uproariously, they get
lost in Al's Barn, where they must deal with a pack of partying
Barbies and Buzz encounters dozens of doppelgangers _ including one
deluded soul who, like Buzz in the last movie, thinks he really is
an astronaut hero.
</P>
<P>
   As hyperkinetic madness ensues, director John Lasseter and his
high-tech team take every opportunity to show us how far the
medium's come in the five years since their first trip to the
playpen. The toys are more emotionally and physically expressive,
the settings and set-pieces more elaborate, and the camerawork
infinitely more mobile than in the original ``Toy Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Humor has kept pace with technology. No less than seven credited
writers have cooked up a feast of visual and conceptual gags. A
running ``Star Wars'' satire pays off brilliantly when you least
expect it, our heroes' miniature perspectives are constantly
challenged by the big real world, and the style differences between
'50s and '90s toys are, well, playfully exploited.
</P>
<P>
   But there are a few elements faster computers and quick wits
have failed to master. For one, the human characters still look
more synthetic than the toys. For another, the filmmakers struggle
to squeeze every beloved character from the first movie into this
one, whether there's really anything for it to do or not.
</P>
<P>
   And sentimentality is a bigger issue than it was the last time
out. Yet the feelings here are so heartfelt _ to say nothing of
fundamentally weird _ that that's hardly the problem it could have
been. Indeed, the wistful new Randy Newman song ``When She Loved
Me,'' sung with touching tenderness by Sarah McLachlan, supports a
beautifully visualized memorial to the exhilaration of a little
girl's affection and the sorrow of her older self's rejection. It's
every toy's tragedy _ and, with its metaphoric wallop, something
most parents will understand all too perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you never owned a doll that cried, scenes like this are
sure to moisten your eyes. &QL;

 &HT;    Bush taking on a higher profile
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Two weeks before his long-awaited first debate
appearance, and two weeks after his disastrous attempt to field an
on-camera question about world leaders, Gov. George W. Bush is
undergoing a small-screen test.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who spent part of Tuesday behind closed doors with several
hundred of his top fund-raisers, is doing an unprecedented round of
high-profile network TV interviews this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time,'' said Bush adviser Karl Rove.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP presidential frontrunner began Tuesday with a live
interview on NBC's ``Today.'' Tonight, a recorded interview with
Bush will air on ABC's ``20/20 Wednesday.'' On Thursday, he goes
live on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   And on Sunday, Bush will make his first foray into the world of
the weekend morning talk shows with an appearance on NBC's ``Meet
the Press.'' For months, other presidential contenders have
gleefully accepted invitations to get free TV time by showing up on
the Sunday morning shows. Bush, however, has declined.
</P>
<P>
   Rove said it's all been part of a strategy timed to coincide
with when Americans, rather than just the politically hyperactive,
are paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a process of building. We needed to lay out a number
of significant policy speeches and so forth as a good backdrop,''
said Rove.
</P>
<P>
   The TV appearances coincide with today's release of Bush's
autobiography, ``A Charge to Keep.'' The interviews also give Bush
a chance to deal, on camera, with reporters questions in the weeks
leading up to the Dec. 2 debate in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   In his Tuesday appearance on ``Today,'' Bush touched on a
variety of subjects, generally offering familiar answers to
familiar questions, including one about the now-infamous pop quiz
in which he could not name the leaders of Pakistan, India and
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth of the matter is I should have done what Senator
(Bill) Bradley did, and not answer the questions by saying, 'I'm
not going to play pop-quizzes,' and talked about how I intend to
keep the peace, which is what I'm going to do Friday in
California,'' said Bush, referring to an upcoming foreign policy
speech at the Reagan Presidential Library.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's foreign-policy credentials also are questioned in
tonight's taped interview on ABC's ``20/20 Wednesday.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I fully concede people can trip me up with questions,'' he
said. ``But the American people, those are the people who are going
to have the ultimate decision in this campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who had been among the more accessible governors in recent
Texas history until the presidential campaign began, now operates
inside a tightly controlled shell in which interviews are granted
selectively. Bush also has ended his tradition of always stopping
to answer reporters' questions after his public appearances.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, he opted not to talk with reporters after he spoke
at an orientation session for gubernatorial appointees.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you know, I'm spending a fair amount of time out of state
these days,'' Bush told the appointees, drawing laughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm focused on Texas, though,'' he added. ``And I mean, I am
still the governor, and I've got a lot of work to do as the
governor, which I do.''
</P>
<P>
   But after the speech, Bush went back to work on the campaign,
heading to the Hyatt Regency for a private session to thank his
campaign ``pioneers,'' supporters who have each raised more than
$100,000 for the White House race.

 &HT;    Richard Jewell settles ABC lawsuit
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard Jewell has settled, for $5,000, his libel suit against
the American Broadcasting Co. stemming from comments made by a
radio talk show host after the 1996 Centennial Olympic Park bombing
in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Hobermann, head of litigation for ABC, confirmed the
settlement, but would not comment further.
</P>
<P>
   The suit concerned comments made during the Lionel Show on WABC,
a New York radio station owned by ABC.
</P>
<P>
   ABC filed a motion to dismiss the suit on the ground that the
comments were a matter of opinion and thus not subject to a libel
claim.
</P>
<P>
   Jewell, working as a security guard, was initially hailed as a
hero for spotting the backpack that held a bomb that exploded early
on July 27, 1996, killing one woman and injuring 111 people. Within
a few days, Jewell was identified as a focus of the FBI
investigation of the bombing. He was cleared of suspicion three
months later.
</P>
<P>
   Jewell's libel suit against The Atlanta Journal-Constitution
newspapers is pending. He has obtained settlements for unspecified
amounts from CNN, NBC-TV and Piedmont College, Jewell's former
employer.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHESTER, N.J. _ Thirty-one hunters in camouflage pants and
orange vests gathered just after dawn on a recent Saturday morning
at a state preserve here, sipping from steaming cups, munching
doughnuts and talking about barrel gauges and bird dogs.
</P>
<P>
   It was a quintessential fall scene, except that the cups
contained cocoa, not coffee, and these hunters were boys and girls,
many just 10 years old and some shorter than their shotguns.
</P>
<P>
   They were waiting to follow grown-up guides into the Black River
Wildlife Management Area to shoot pheasant _ five dozen farm-raised
birds that volunteers had deposited in fields there an hour
earlier. On a patchwork of other state preserves across New Jersey,
nearly 500 other children were doing the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   It was Take a Kid Pheasant Hunting Day, an event run since 1996
by the New Jersey Division of Fish, Game and Wildlife, and partly
paid for by the National Rifle Association Foundation, an arm of
the gun lobby. (The state supplied the wardens and the land; the
gun foundation paid for the birds and the shotgun shells.
Volunteers from New Jersey hunting clubs supplied the dogs and the
doughnuts.)
</P>
<P>
   Shooting programs for children are nothing new; the NRA and
private gun clubs have had them for generations. In recent years,
state wildlife agencies around the country have run special youth
hunts for an assortment of game, including wild pigs, rabbits,
ducks and deer. But the New Jersey pheasant shoot was an example of
a newer and growing phenomenon _ of public state wildlife agencies
and the gun lobby working hand in hand to promote hunting among
children.
</P>
<P>
   The public agencies and private group say they are motivated by
the same goal: to shore up hunting's popularity, which has been
slowly declining in the 1990s, according to recent federal and
state hunter surveys. The trend has left gun groups anxious to find
new members and state wildlife agencies _ whose budgets are almost
entirely dependent on license fees and income from an 11 percent
federal tax on guns and ammunition distributed to the states _
scrambling for revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shooting sports are like any other endeavor _ youth is our
future,'' said William Poole, director of education and training
for the NRA. ``The state agencies understand that same
philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   Promoting hunting among young people, he added, ``is mutually
beneficial to all of us, and to meeting all of our missions.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun makers are chipping in, donating hundreds of ``youth-size''
shotguns over the last few years to state agencies for children's
shooting clinics and hunter training.
</P>
<P>
   But animal rights and gun control groups have sharply criticized
the state-run youth hunting programs, saying they are designed to
create new interest in guns just as the country is grappling with a
spate of shootings by children and young adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we head into a new century,''said Stuart Chaifetz, the
founder of Honor and Non-Violence for Animals, a New Jersey animal
rights group, ``do we really want to have the state teaching kids
that shooting is fun?''
</P>
<P>
   National gun control groups like the Violence Policy Center have
criticized the flow of public money to private hunting initiatives
for children. For example, in 1993, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service was widely criticized for giving a $230,000 grant to the
National Shooting Sports Foundation, a private group representing
gun makers, to create and distribute to schools a videotape
promoting the role of hunting in wildlife management.
</P>
<P>
   But there has been little public debate about the flow of money
in the other direction _ from the private NRA Foundation to public
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that the flow is still a trickle. Most youth
shooting programs sponsored by the NRA are run by private groups,
like the Boy Scouts, Jaycees or shooting clubs. But NRA grants
ranging from $1,000 to $10,000 have gone to state-run youth hunting
programs in Oregon, Texas, New Jersey and other states, NRA
officials say, and this kind of partnership is growing.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey game officials say they are happy to accept the
money. ``The NRA promotes safe and responsible gun handling,'' said
Patrick Carr, the state's hunter education administrator, ``and
members raise money so the foundation can support programs like
ours. We're showing these youths the proper way to use a firearm in
a legal activity _ hunting. If you don't show them the right way,
that's the wrong move.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission recently used a $10,000
NRA grant to help buy and develop software for a big-screen hunting
simulator that is trucked to schools and county fairs, where
children and adults can fire virtual guns at virtual game.
</P>
<P>
   The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife has received money
from the NRA and Pheasants Forever, a private pheasant-hunting and
conservation group, for its annual pheasant hunts for children.
</P>
<P>
   The pheasant group has bought farm-raised birds for the
children's hunts, while the NRA grants have been used to buy
ammunition for shotgun clinics that are offered on the same day,
said Tony Burtt, the outdoor skills coordinator for the Oregon
wildlife agency.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut and Texas are among
more than three dozen states that have received donated batches of
50 small shotguns for use in clinics and hunter education programs
from H &AMP; R 1871, a gun maker in Gardner, Mass., which specializes
in small firearms for children and women.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Sharpless, a senior vice president at the eight-year-old
company, said the donation program was focused on improving gun
safety, not on promoting gun use.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not courting kids into the shooting sports,'' he said.
``These are kids whose families are already hunting. The goal is to
facilitate safety. You wouldn't put a 6-year-old child on a 26-inch
mountain bike.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In late October, Connecticut held its annual youth pheasant hunt
on state property in East Windsor, north of Hartford. The
Connecticut program is much smaller than New Jersey's and is not
underwritten by the NRA. Even so, it generated its share of
protesters.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the 20 or so people who picketed at the entrance to the
Dr. John E. Flaherty Field Trial area outnumbered the seven hunters
between the ages of 12 and 16 who spent several hours stalking
pheasants with volunteer adult guides. As the children arrived, the
protesters chanted, ``Shame, shame.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All this does is provide living targets for these kids and
increase their comfort level with firearms,'' said William Manetti,
52, of New Haven, Conn., a founder of the Animal Rights Front, a
small New Haven group.
</P>
<P>
   David Leff, Connecticut's deputy commissioner of environmental
protection, defended the program. He said the program provided a
substitute for the kind of guidance that used to come from older
relatives but is fading.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The annual youth pheasant hunt in New Jersey, held Nov. 6, one
week before the regular pheasant-hunting season, which began Nov.
13, has been more popular every year, said Carr, the state hunter
education administrator, growing from 143 participants in 1996 to
around 500 this year.
</P>
<P>
   On this Saturday morning at the 3,000-acre preserve in Chester,
Carr and several other state officials and volunteers checked in a
steady flow of children.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone had learned of the hunts in the annual state
booklet announcing hunting regulations and season dates. Many of
the children, including several girls, said they had grown up
planning to follow their fathers into the field. Michael Meola,
from Denville, said he enjoyed taking his son, also named Michael,
on the children's hunts because they were safe and uncrowded.
``It's controlled,'' Meola said. ``Not like when you take them out
on opening day with a million guys out there.''
</P>
<P>
   All of them had junior hunting licenses pinned to the back of
their orange vests and had taken the mandatory 10-hour state
hunting education course. Several boys restlessly hefted their
shotgun cases while others were told by their fathers to not touch
their guns until cleared to pick them up.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles away, out in the fields, volunteers were opening
crates, pulling out the pheasants, then _ holding the birds by the
legs _ spinning them to make them dizzy, so they would stay put in
the grass until flushed out.
</P>
<P>
   In the parking lot, the pointers and setters owned by volunteer
dog handlers eagerly paced to and fro.
</P>
<P>
   Standing atop a picnic table, Carr gave a briefing on safety
rules. ``Keep your muzzle up,'' he said. ``Don't shoot a bird on
the ground; don't shoot cripples. The dogs will get them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have a fun day, but be safe and responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the children lined up to receive six shells apiece.
</P>
<P>
   As the last morning mist evaporated, the group headed off to the
far corner of the state tract, which winds along the Black River.
Groups of four children followed the dog handlers to separate
fields, each of which had been stocked with two pheasants for each
young hunter.
</P>
<P>
   Carr explained that the stocking helped ensure that at least a
few children would kill a bird. ``We can't pull the trigger for
them, but we can certainly put the bird out in front of them,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Konboz, 11, of Hawthorne lugged her father's full-size
12-gauge shotgun as she and her father, Anthony, and two boys
followed Scott Wardrop, of Wayne, his dog, Limestone Annie, and his
daughter Kristen, 13.
</P>
<P>
   The dog, scurrying through the weedy field, flushed out the
first bird after about 20 minutes, but it alighted in a tree before
Mary, who was given the first shot, could pull the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't we shoot it in the tree?'' asked Ray Jensen, 11, of
Brodheadsville, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Ray Sr., hesitated, then said: ``We can't. It's not
right.''
</P>
<P>
   The group hiked on, with Annie weaving ahead, nose to the
ground. Sporadic gunfire came from adjacent fields. Another
pheasant burst from the bushes. But Mary hesitated _ appropriately
_ as the bird curled around behind her over the heads of the
hunting party, eliciting a wave of quick dives for cover.
</P>
<P>
   As the morning progressed with no kills by Wardrop's group of
hunters, Konboz said their low success rate proved that this was a
sport, not a slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   During a break, the children rested on the grass, their guns
around them, drinking from cartons of fruit punch and talking about
Harry Potter.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, nobody in Wardrop's group had killed a bird, and
only one had pulled a trigger.
</P>
<P>
   When all the groups returned to check out with officials after
the two-hour hunt, the hunters learned that other groups had had
better luck. Carr noted that 11 of the 64 stocked birds had been
shot, with one more killed by a diving red-tailed hawk.
</P>
<P>
   The successful young hunters pulled their pheasants from pouches
to pose for pictures. One bird exploded to life and burst into the
bushes. It was retrieved by a dog and killed by one of the dog
handlers.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Dara, chairman of the New Jersey Federation of Sportsmen's
Clubs, a private group that provided most of the volunteers, said
anti-hunting sentiment just stiffened the resolve of hunters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just look at 30 years ago versus today,'' he said. ``Then, you
still had kids out in the field with their fathers and you had very
little violence in society, even though there were more guns per
person. Just look at things now.''
</P>
<P>
   He said animal rights demonstrators even showed up at a recent
fishing tournament sponsored by the sportsmen's federation. ``Can
you believe it _ fish rights?'' Dara said. ``But that's all right.
They just help unite us.''
</P>
<P>
   Around 11 a.m., the first round of young hunters and their
fathers headed home, some to cook their birds, others to talk about
the ones that got away.

   ``I would like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to

me to finally test my limits. ... I have stretched my capacity for
abuse and denigration as far as I can go. ... In 10 long months you

anecdotes with which to amaze and amuse my friends.'' McLaughlin is
married to  &UR; Cristina Vidal McLaughlin &LR; , vice president of the

<P>
   ``I would like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to
work on a television show. It's unlikely that any legitimate news

 &UR; Clinton &LR; . ... But you also did so much more than that. You allowed
me to finally test my limits. ... I have stretched my capacity for
abuse and denigration as far as I can go. ... In 10 long months you

anecdotes with which to amaze and amuse my friends.'' McLaughlin is
married to  &UR; Cristina Vidal McLaughlin &LR; , vice president of the
program's production company.
</P>
<P>

By JULIO MARTINEZ,  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _  &UR;  &LR; Housed at Hollywood's tiny Tamarind Theatre,
Marco Greco has brought his successful off-Broadway, one-person
reminiscence of growing up under the colorful if not always
benevolent dictatorship of his father Mike, better known as Il Duce
(The Duke), proprietor of renowned Mike's Deli in the
Italian-American neighborhood of Arthur Avenue in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The production is a loving yet unsentimental portrait of a young
man who is shaped by his father yet must eventually cast off the
older man's influence if he is to move on in his life. Greco, under
the facile guidance of Stephen Adly Guirgis, flows smoothly in and
out of Mike's larger-than-life persona as well as incorporating
many of the neighborhood characters that filled his father's world.
</P>
<P>
   Il Duce didn't converse with his son, he made pronouncements.
Such gems as, ``In, life baby, it's good to know to breaka your
ass,'' and ``You good to the mozzarella, and the mozzarella be good
to you,'' were constantly rolling off the side of his mouth that
wasn't clenched firmly onto his impressive cigar. To demonstrate
his father's fanatical commitment to his deli counter, Greco
recounts his experience at age 9 when he first went to work under
the tutelage of Il Duce.
</P>
<P>
   The audience is treated to a complete lesson in the art of
making mozzarella cheese while Greco's dad is constantly chiding
the boy to stop wincing every time he sticks his hand in the near
boiling hot water used to temper the cheese to the right
consistency. To prove the worth of the product, the cheese is
actually served to audience members during the intermission. (It
was delicious.)
</P>
<P>
   Through Greco's incisive observations of the neighborhood world
that nurtured him, the audience is introduced to Mike's many
friends and admirers, including his best friend, Joey Bananas and
the four distinctly individual ``Joeys'' working behind the
counter. It is hilarious to listen to these men observe their
coffee-break rituals, which included harmlessly macho
philosophizing about women and sex.
</P>
<P>
   One such serious conversation dealt with the preference of being
stranded on a desert island with an overweight Elizabeth Taylor or
the waiflike Brigitte Bardot. Il Duce's sense of practicality
reasoned for Taylor, stating, ``If there is any food on the island,
she is going to find it.''
</P>
<P>
   The production follows Greco through his cocky teen-age years as
a high school dropout working behind the counter, his early 20s as
a kind of deli boss clone of his dad, and his eventual awakening to
the possibilities of the world around him. But it is Il Duce who
constantly grabs the limelight in this ultimately heartwarming tale
of a post-World War II immigrant population that tenaciously
adhered to the American dream that if you were willing to work hard
you could be a success in this country. &QL;

GROUP SAYS PLAN WOULD CUT MEDICARE AID TO SOME TEACHING HOSPITALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 By JUDY HOLLAND and DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A plan before Congress aimed at bailing out ailing
teaching hospitals would actually cause 121 institutions _ many of
them in the Northeast _ to lose money, the Greater New York
Hospital Association said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under a proposal that would more evenly distribute the money
Medicare gives to train medical residents, most of the teaching
hospitals would start losing money in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   According to the health care trade association, New York would
suffer a net loss of $45 million, Pennsylvania $7 million, Maryland
$5 million, the District of Columbia $3 million, Massachusetts $2.9
million and Texas $2.6 million, the association reported.
</P>
<P>
   California would gain $21.9 million, Florida $13 million,
Minnesota $7.5 million, West Virginia $6.6 million and Tennessee
$6.5 million, according to the association.
</P>
<P>
   The association based its conclusions on an analysis of data
provided by the Health Care Financing Administration, the federal
agency that oversees Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Among the hardest hit would be two hospitals in New York City _
Montefiore Medical Center, slated to lose $10 million over five
years, and Beth Israel Medical Center, which stands to lose $8
million.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, 600 hospitals, such as Albany Medical Center in
Albany, N.Y., would see no impact, and 271 hospitals would gain.
</P>
<P>
   This reshuffling of Medicare money to teaching hospitals was
part of an agreement to restore $12 billion in Medicare payments to
health care providers. The money was cut in 1997 when Congress
balanced the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., chairman of the House Ways and Means
health subcommittee, has argued that disparities in what Medicare
pays to teaching hospitals for each resident are unfair. It amount
ranges from $20,000 to $223,000 per resident.
</P>
<P>
   The disparities arose in 1984 when Congress decided to pay
teaching hospitals money for training resident physicians based on
what the institutions calculated were their uncovered costs.
</P>
<P>
   If a teaching hospital had the support of a state legislature or
had a wealthy population of patients, Medicare paid less for each
resident.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the older East Coast institutions got four times as much
money per resident as some of the newer hospitals in the West and
Sunbelt.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan now before Congress, teaching hospitals would be
limited to getting between $48,000 and $96,000 in Medicare money
for each resident physician, according to the New York hospital
association. The plan is expected to be approved this week.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the 121 hospitals facing cuts are vowing to
fight the decreases in Medicare money.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill was not supposed to redistribute money from one
hospital to another _ it was supposed to provide relief from
Medicare cuts enacted in 1997,'' said David Rich, senior vice
president of government affairs for the hospital association. Rich
said he is hopeful that ``we can come back in the future and try to
turn this around.''
</P>
<P>
   If not, Rich predicted many of the hospitals facing Medicare
cuts would have to tighten their belts by cutting staff,
eliminating community services or reducing the number of residents
they train.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Coast Hospital, a small facility in San Francisco, will
lose $234,044 in funding from 2000 through 2005, the survey shows.

<P>
   First came corporate day-care centers. Then it was concierge
services that pick up employees' dry cleaning or deliver their
groceries for a fee. Now comes the virtual discount mall, offering
workers everything from books to car insurance at up to 10 percent
off, right on their office computer screens.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest attempt to please without giving big raises, some
of the nation's largest companies are trying to make shopping of
all kinds both cheaper and easier for their employees. It is part
of an explosion of ``soft benefits'' that, unlike the hard
perquisites of health insurance and retirement plans, cost
employers almost nothing.
</P>
<P>
   With unemployment at a 29-year low and people working longer
hours, executives see the programs as a way to lift workers'
morale. They also assume that employees who do their shopping in
cyberspace will spend less time ducking out of the office to run
errands. At the least, Susan R. Froid, a senior human-resource
manager at Microsoft, said, employees ``don't have to spend all
their free time figuring out what they're going to do _ it's an
easy decision to make.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the pull for Lisa Rose, who works on hiring and
training for Sylvan Learning Systems, an education company in
Baltimore. When she heard about the offers, she logged onto
Sylvan's Web site and bought medical insurance for her 6-month-old
Labrador, Ewing, who is named after the New York Knicks center whom
her husband idolizes. The cost, $16 a month, is deducted from her
paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   She also bought roadside insurance that covers towing, locksmith
service and travel planning for $4.16 a month, not even bothering
to compare the insurer's prices with AAA's. ``It was so easy for me
to sign up, and I don't have to pay another bill every month,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The trend has picked up in recent weeks, with such corporate
giants as AlliedSignal, Hallmark Cards, Nordstrom and Northwest
Airlines connecting to their internal Web sites virtual malls where
merchants sell everything from Hickory Farms sausage to MCI
Worldcom long-distance service. The pioneers for such plans
include, Blue Cross/Blue Shield, Boeing and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so difficult to attract employees, and the retention side
is getting more difficult,'' said Joe Demarte, the vice president
for human resources at Nordstrom, the department store chain, which
employs 40,000 people. The discounts are the latest addition to a
benefit package that includes adoption advice and discounts on
legal services.
</P>
<P>
   The virtual malls are an Internet-age remake of the old
corporate discount card that gave employees free tickets to a
nearby amusement park or a few dollars off at the local florist.
The World Wide Web, however, allows workers in far-off satellite
offices to take advantage of the discounts. It also enables
employers to negotiate deals for a much wider array of products,
including more expensive ones like insurance or even home-mortgage
rates.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet discounts are part of a wider move toward offering
more soft benefits to placate time-burdened workers. In 1994, for
example, only 8 percent of companies made car insurance available
to workers through company-sponsored plans. Next year, the portion
should rise to 35 percent, according to Hewitt Associates, a
human-resources consulting firm in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   The virtual malls are typically operated by Internet start-ups,
which charge employers nothing for the service and build
password-protected links from the corporate intranet sites to, say,
toysrus.com. In exchange for what amounts to advertising on the Web
site and in company brochures describing the program, merchants
then offer the 5 percent to 10 percent discounts and pay a few
percentage points of each sale to the Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is even creating a new niche of e-commerce.
Employeesavings.com received a $5-million investment earlier this
fall from Benchmark Partners, which previously financed eBay and
Webvan. By early 2000, Employeesavings says its plans will cover
two million workers. And Rewards Plus, which sells only financial
products, expects its annual sales to more than double to $9
million this year, as it increases its work force by 25 percent
each quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The programs are not without their downsides. Not all employees
have Internet access, and those who do not _ some Nordstrom sales
clerks or Northwest flight attendants, for example _ are often the
ones who need the discounts the most because they make less money.
(Companies say, however, that some of the discounts are available
over the phone or at local stores.)
</P>
<P>
   Web shopping is also a potential threat to productivity, giving
workers a company-approved reason to procrastinate. Already, the
peak time for Web traffic and many consumer e-commerce sites is the
middle of the workday, when people have access to high-speed
corporate Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   But human resource managers said they were not worried. ``This
isn't something where you're going to go out and play for hours,''
Demarte said. ``It probably isn't any different from what they
already do'' by making personal phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   And it may be cheaper. Robert A. Arrison, 41, a computer systems
administrator at Aramark Inc., the Philadelphia food service
company, was shopping for homeowners' and auto insurance a year
ago. He checked the rates of Allstate Insurance, which had sold him
a previous policy, and Allmerica Financial, which participated in
his company's discount plan. By going with Allmerica, he said, he
saved almost $200 a year.

ROADS (Phoenix) - Urban roads are crowded not because of explosive
population growth but because the people that live in cities drive
more than ever, a national study says. It shows that while the
metro Phoenix population grew by 68 percent from 1982-1997, the
miles driven climbed 131 percent. This left the Phoenix area with
the equivalent of an extra 1.9 million people from a driving
standpoint, according to the analysis by the Surface Transportation
Policy Project. By MARY JO PITZL. Story will move in the ``A''

 &HT;    CLINTON TO PRESS RUSSIA TO CEASE CHECHNYA BOMBING, BEGIN TALKS
WITH REBELS
 &HT;    (625&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ President Clinton hopes to use a meeting here
Thursday among his European and Central Asian counterparts to press
Russia to end its bloody two-month-old campaign against Chechen
separatists.
</P>
<P>
   He faces an uphill battle, though, trying to convince Russian
President Boris Yeltsin to enter into peace talks with Chechnya's
rebel leaders and abandon massive air strikes that have left
hundreds of civilians dead and some 200,000 others homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must be clear with Russia that its fight against terrorism
is right, but that the use of indiscriminate force against
civilians is wrong,'' Clinton said Monday in a speech to Turkey's
general assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has stressed the need for a political solution to the
Chechnya dispute, and he insisted that continuing Russia's military
campaign was ``likely to exacerbate the very tensions Russia wants
to resolve.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue appears certain to dominate a two-day summit opening
here Thursday among heads of state from the 54 countries that
belong to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old OSCE groups the United States and the countries
of Europe and the former Soviet Union. The Vienna-based
organization is meant to knit together former Cold War foes around
such civilian themes as respect for human rights, and improving
cultural and scientific contacts.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has long favored strengthening the OSCE as a sort of
civilian analog to NATO, the Western military alliance built to
stand sentry against the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to trade on Russia's affinity for the organization,
Clinton and a number of U.S. allies are expected to press Yeltsin
to invite the OSCE to play a mediating role between Moscow and
separatists in the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think OSCE is a very logical party for that,'' said White
House National Security Advisor Samuel Berger. ``It's the
institution that (the Russians) really see as embrasive of all of
Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   A few OSCE civilian observers are in parts of Chechnya,
monitoring what they can of the situation there and offering some
humanitarian aid for refugees. Activities in both areas could be
stepped up on short notice as an inducement to bring Yeltsin to the
bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly at least, he's resisted such overtures up to now.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Yeltsin has sharply hardened his public views in
apparent anticipation of being ganged up on at Thursday's summit.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin contends that Russian troops and warplanes are waging a
just fight against Chechen
</P>
<P>
   terrorists Moscow accuses of blowing up buildings and killings
civilians in Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian leader, expected to attend the OSCE summit, said
Monday that Western powers ``have no right to blame Russia for
destroying bandits and terrorists on its territory.'' He vowed to
press the fight, widely supported among Russians, ``as long as
there is even one terrorist there.''
</P>
<P>
   Chechen separatists regard their province as illegally occupied
by Russia. Generations of Chechens have been taught from an early
age to loath their Russian overlords and to adopt independence as a
bone marrow ambition.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is an explosive one for Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops suffered a humiliating setback at the hands of
Chechen rebels during fighting three years ago. Despite two years
of all-out combat, the Russian army was unable to subdue fiercely
anti-Russian Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The situation struck hard at the national pride of Russians,
already reeling from the abrupt loss of empire that came with the
Soviet Union's collapse. With Russia facing parliamentary elections
in December and a presidential vote next June, Chechnya has become
fraught with political overtones, making compromise difficult for
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Chechnya won't be the only topic on the OSCE agenda. Leaders are
also expected to:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  update the organization's charter _ for the first time since
the Soviet Union collapsed at the end of 1991 _ to reflect growing
ties among former Cold War rivals;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  agree to reductions in the number of troops and tanks allowed
to be deployed in ways that could be seen as a threat by other
countries. Those revisions would be contained in changes proposed
to the so-called Conventional Forces in Europe agreement;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  and approve the establishment of crisis prevention teams, made
up of human rights monitors, election observers and others, that
could be dispatched on short notice to try to head off the outbreak
of violence.

   LOS ANGELES _  &UR;  &LR; Legendary radio personality and social
commentator Fred Allen (1894-1956) deserves better treatment than
this woefully misconceived dramatic survey of his life and career.
Playwright Arnold Peyser and director Pamela Hall fail to establish
a viable structure for this look at Allen's 18-year radio tenure
(1932-1950) as writer and star of ``Allen's Alley,'' but the main
culprit is television actor Jack Riley, who literally stumbles and
mumbles his way through the role of Allen.
</P>
<P>
   Peyser has set the piece at an NBC broadcast studio in 1956, six
years after ``Allen's Alley'' had been canceled by the network. The
occasion is a reunion of Allen, his wife Portland Hoffa (Denise
Moses), and the ensemble of actors who had created all the
memorable characters who inhabited Allen's fictional ``alley.''
</P>
<P>
   The stated purpose of the gathering is to prepare a
retrospective memorial edition of the show, but that is just
Peyser's device to reprise memorable vignettes from the show and
rehash the events of Allen's life, including his early vaudeville
years, his lifelong romance with Portland, his made-up feud with
radio-rival Jack Benny, and his struggles with network executives,
censors and the encroaching Communist witch hunts.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Peyser's creaky expositional efforts to highlight
40-plus years of Fred Allen's life, this journey down memory lane
of the ``golden age of radio'' would be entertaining except for the
monumental miscasting of Allen, whose wry wit and nasal delivery
ruled the airwaves during the '30s and '40s. Riley, who is perhaps
best-known for his recurring role as the misanthropic Mr. Carlin on
``The Bob Newhart Show,'' appears totally uncomfortable performing
on a live stage despite the supportive efforts of a talented
ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   None of the classic ``Allen's Alley'' routines come to life.
What does work, however, are the characterizations of Allen's
repertory ensemble, including Peter Donald (Ted Schwartz), Kenny
Delmar (Glenn Taranto), Parker Fennelly (William Knight) and
Minerva Pious (Diane Botnick), bringing to life, respectively, such
legendary fictional personalities as the always inebriated Ajax
Cassidy, blowhard politician Sen. Claghorn, ultimate New England
curmudgeon Titus Moody and the hilarious Yiddish housewife Mrs.
Nussbaum. Moses is quite believable as the always perky and adoring
Portland, and Whitney Rydbeck provides a brief but effective turn
as Jack Benny.

TOM AMMIANO WINS KEY ENDORSEMENT FOR S.F. MAYOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: CORRECTS 5th graf first name of Moscone)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund, a major financial
supporter of homosexual candidates for state and local offices,
endorsed Tom Ammiano Tuesday for mayor of San Francisco in the Dec.
14 runoff against incumbent Willie Brown, a longtime supporter of
gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   If Ammiano, 58, wins, he will be the first openly gay chief
executive of a major U.S. city.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Bond, the Victory Fund's executive director, said that
while Brown, 65, has been ``a tremendously fair-minded leader''
with a strong gay rights track record, ``our mission to elect great
openly gay and lesbian public servants is clear, even when they are
not running against anti-gay extremists.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond added, ``We must open up the political process wherever we
can until sexual orientation is no longer a barrier to public
service.''
</P>
<P>
   In explaining the selection between two pro-gay candidates, Bond
invoked the name of Harvey Milk, the gay San Francisco supervisor
gunned down in 1978 along with George Moscone, the city's mayor at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting Milk, Bond said, ``It is not enough to have friends
represent us, no matter how good those friends may be. We must give
people the chance to judge us by our own leaders and our own
legislators.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond said both mayoral candidates have such strong gay rights
records that he doesn't anticipate gay and lesbian public policy
issues becoming a major factor in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, formerly the Democratic speaker of the state assembly in
Sacramento, is the city's first black mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano, president of San Francisco's board of supervisors,
waged a successful write-in candidacy on a shoestring budget of
$25,000, placing second after Brown in the Nov. 2 mayoral election
and ahead of former San Francisco Mayor Frank Jordan and a dozen
other candidates. Ammiano won 25 percent of the vote to Brown's 39
percent. By holding Brown to less than 50 percent of the vote,
Ammiano forced the run-off.
</P>
<P>
   The victory fund, which endorsed Ammiano in two previous
campaigns for city supervisor, cited his work as a ``driving
force'' behind the city's domestic partnership legislation that
requires city contractors to offer domestic partners of employees
the same benefits offered to the spouses of married workers. The
fund also cited his campaign promises to bring more affordable
housing and jobs to downtrodden neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano has also been endorsed by the San Francisco Probation
Officers Association and the San Francisco Tenants Union.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has won endorsements from the city's Republican Party and
the San Francisco Apartment Association, the city's largest
landlord group.
</P>
<P>
   The Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund has generated more than $2
million for gay and lesbian candidates.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The world economy is growing at an unexpectedly fast
pace because of surprisingly strong expansion in Japan and South
Korea, a more modest upturn in Europe and economic resilience in
the United States, an organization of the world's richest nations
said Tuesday in a semiannual appraisal.
</P>
<P>
   The group, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development, which helps coordinate policy among the affluent
nations, said it expected the global growth rate to reach 3.5
percent next year. Its assessment in May had forecast growth in
2000 of 2.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outlook for world and OECD-wide output growth has improved
substantially over the past few months,'' the organization said.
</P>
<P>
   Its report suggested that Japan's economic recovery in
particular had been more vigorous than anticipated. The
organization's earlier assessment projected that Japan would
continue to struggle next year against recession, its worst since
the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``These changes reflect mainly unexpected near-term momentum in
the United States economy, a stronger and more rapid resumption of
growth in Japan and, particularly, South Korea, as well as a
slightly better outlook for the European Union,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Europe, it said, is showing signs of expansion and in 2000 and
2001 is expected to grow 2.8 percent in the 11-nation euro currency
zone. In its last report, the OECD predicted euro zone growth next
year of 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The report also suggested that European countries would make
progress against high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   It forecast 3.1 percent growth for the United States next year,
after predicting last spring that the American economy faced a
natural slowdown and 2 percent growth after eight years of
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   And it said that Japan, the world's second-largest economy, had
emerged from recession faster than expected, but that in the long
term it faced risks from the continued appreciation of the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese currency's strength this year has already hurt
profit at many big-name corporations that derive much of their
business from exports, like Sony, Toyota and Hitachi. The yen's
rise partly reflects the increased prospect of higher interest
rates in Japan because of the heavy borrowing that the government
must undertake to stimulate growth through spending.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Japanese government announced a new package of
economic stimulants worth about $171 billion, almost twice the
amount that had been expected a few weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-member OECD, founded in 1960, was originally made up of
nations in Europe and North America. It expanded to include Japan,
Australia, New Zealand and Finland. More recently, Mexico, the
Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and South Korea have joined.

   &LR; We wanted to know what distinguishes the five actors who have
played James Bond over the years, stamping the character with
unique interpretations of the suave and deadly superspy. So we
asked the man who knows everything (and the only guy who's worked
with them all): Desmond Llewelyn, the wry, 85-year-old Welshman who
has played Q, British Intelligence's irritable master gadget-maker,
in 17 of the 19 official Bond films.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sean (Connery), being the first, was, of course, the
prototype,'' Llewelyn says. ``People who saw Roger Moore first
prefer him. He made Bond much lighter because he couldn't copy
Sean's visceral charisma, naturally. So he made him more jokey.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then poor old (George) Lazenby,'' he says, referring to
the underequipped, one-shot star of the sixth Bond film, ``On Her
Majesty's Secret Service.'' ``I mean, he just wasn't an actor. But
he wasn't that bad; if he'd behaved properly, he might have been a
very good Bond. But he acted like an idiot on the set.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we had Timothy Dalton (1987's ``The Living Daylights''
and 1989's ``Licence to Kill''), who to the Bond aficionados, of
course, is the nearest to Ian Fleming's Bond. Fleming said that
Bond was what every man wants to be but knows damn well that he
can't be, and he was a very unpleasant character. Timothy made no
concessions whatsoever to the movies, he just made him a really
hard man. So a lot of people, even if they thought they were
wonderful films, didn't think his really felt like Bond films.
There wasn't enough fantasy in them at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now Pierce (Brosnan), I think, has gone back to Sean in a way,
except Sean very seldom looked really beaten up. But Pierce does
for that second after a fight _ but then he straightens his tie and
is back to normal, which of course you have to be, you've got to
remain romantic whatever happens to you. But he does show pain. And
he has the best connections of any Bond with the opposite sex.''

GEORGIA TRIES ANXIOUSLY TO STAY OUT OF CHECHEN CONFLICT

<P>
   TBILISI, Georgia _ Capped in snow, the Shatili Mountains are
fabled for their rugged beauty. These days they are also one of the
Caucasus' more anxious borders.
</P>
<P>
   To the north is Chechnya, a brutal battleground for the Russian
military. On the southern side of the mountain divide is Georgia, a
former Soviet republic.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgians would like nothing better than to stay out of the
fighting in the rebellious Russian province to the north. But they
have had to contend with a hard-nosed Russian military, which
recently sought permission to open a new front against Chechnya
from Georgian territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very important for us to have good-neighborly relations
with Russia, but good relations do not mean saying no to our
principles,'' said Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze in an
interview. ``I am categorically opposed to having Russian and
Georgian border troops jointly defend the border with Chechnya. And
I am even more opposed to the idea of the Russian side using
Russian bases in Georgia against Chechnya in a military campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   When world leaders meet this week in Istanbul to discuss
security issues, the increasingly tense situation in the Caucasus
will be among their top concerns. Diplomats have been working
behind the scenes on conventional arms limits, energy pipelines and
the burning conflict in Chechnya to make the summit meeting a
success _ or, at least, not a disappointing embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Baltic nations during Soviet times, the Caucasus is
shaping up as an arena for East-West competition, and possibly even
a bit of Russian intrigue. The tone may have been set last week
when Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev declared that Russia
and the United States were locked in a bitter struggle for
dominance of the Caucasus, Caspian and Central Asian regions.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Georgia's leaders are worried that Russia is
determined not only to subdue Chechnya but also to try to reverse
Russia's waning influence in the neighboring region.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that Georgia would be particularly
sensitive to the political winds blowing from Moscow. Shevardnadze,
a former Soviet foreign minister, has repeatedly insisted that the
future of his country lies with the West. He has even said Georgia
intends to apply for NATO membership in 2005, which would be the
last year of Shevardnadze's next term as president, assuming he is
re-elected next spring.
</P>
<P>
   But Georgia is also a poor nation, burdened with secessionist
movements of its own and a long legacy of economic and military
dependence on its Russian neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Russia still maintains four military bases here, including the
Vaziani air base just 30 minutes from Tbilisi, Georgia's capital.
Shevardnadze's policy has been to develop Georgia's links with the
West while gradually easing the Russian troops out.
</P>
<P>
   Russia recently removed the last of its 15,000 border troops.
Georgian officials have sought to use the coming Istanbul meeting
to negotiate the closing of key Russian bases as well as to bring
about a sharp reduction in the number of Russian forces here. The
understandings are part of an updated accord limiting conventional
arms, which diplomats hope to sign in Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Georgia's relations with Russia have worsened
as a result of the Chechen war. And Georgia's officials have become
concerned that the Russians are in no hurry to leave.
</P>
<P>
   In October, for instance, Russia sought to send several hundred
border troops back to Georgia to help the Georgians patrol their
50-mile-long border with Chechnya, the only stretch of the Chechen
border that is not under Russia's jurisdiction. It is currently
guarded by 160 lightly armed Georgian border troops.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 4,000 refugees, mostly women and children, have
crossed into Georgia in the last two months to flee the fighting in
Chechnya. That is a trickle compared with the 200,000 refugees who
have fled to Ingushetia, another Russian republic bordering on
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia believes that the mountain passes to Georgia may
become an exit route for Shamil Basayev, the Chechen warlord sought
by the Russians, or some of his fighters if Russian troops continue
their march into Chechnya and seize Grozny, the capital. Russian
officials have also charged that arms have been smuggled across the
border, an allegation Georgians deny.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has also broached the idea of using some of its bases in
Georgia in the military campaign against Chechnya, the Georgians
say. Sergeyev planned to come to Tbilisi to discuss the plan, but
his trip was canceled after Georgia rejected the idea, Georgian
officials here said.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgian government fears that the Russian aim was to use
its border troops and bases to encircle Chechnya and open up a new
front in the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had we gone along with those options, we could have been drawn
into a big conflict in the Caucasus,'' Shevardnadze said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Georgia's rebuff, however, did not go down well in Moscow. Soon
afterward, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin declared that
citizens from Georgia and the neighboring former Soviet republic of
Azerbaijan would have to obtain visas to travel to Russia,
ostensibly to guard against arms trafficking and infiltration by
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Then Russian military officials unleashed a barrage of
allegations suggesting that the Georgians were in league with the
Chechen fighters. In fact, there is no love lost between the
Christian Orthodox Georgian authorities and the militantly Islamic
Basayev, who fought on the side of Muslim secessionists in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Despite the angry words, experts here doubt that Russia has a
grand strategy to reassert itself in the Caucasus. But as Russian
President Boris Yeltsin's physical and political health has
declined, rival agendas have emerged in Moscow, with the Russian
militang a particularly hard line.
</P>
<P>
   An immediate test of Russian intentions will come this week at
the Istanbul meeting, held by the Organization for Economic and
Security Cooperation in Europe, where world leaders hope to sign an
updated version of the 1990 agreement limiting conventional forces
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   As part of that accord, the Georgians want the Russians to
accept the principle that their forces in Georgia should not exceed
those of the modest Georgian military. That would force the
Russians to cut their armored combat vehicles in Georgia, for
instance, by more than half.
</P>
<P>
   Georgian officials want the Russians to agree to quit the
Vaziani air base, near their capital, and the Gudauta base, in the
Georgian Abkhazian region.
</P>
<P>
   The Vaziani base is a visible reminder of Moscow's once-dominant
role here. Gudauta is situated in the breakaway Abkhazian sector,
where Georgia has long suspected the Russians of aiding the
separatists.
</P>
<P>
   At least some Georgian officials, however, are dubious that
Russia is prepared to meet their demands and to reduce, quickly,
its military presence in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia's broad strategy is to keep their numbers in the
Caucasus and even increase these numbers,'' said Archil Gegeshidze,
the national security adviser to Shevardnadze. ``Agreeing with our
proposals and starting a process of reduction is something that is
against their long-term strategy.''

ONCE MORE UNTO THE BREACH 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Eds: Repeating for Long Beach Press Telegram) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News

<P>
   &LR; Once more unto the breach ...
</P>
<P>
   The 19th official James Bond movie, ``The World Is Not Enough,''
opens Friday, begging the not-so-burning question, so what's new?
</P>
<P>
   After all, over 37 years and 20 previous movies (``Casino
Royale'' and ``Never Say Never Again'' were the two made outside of
Broccoli family control), the British spy films have settled into a
formula as rigid as it is successful. Monomaniacal villains,
decorative babes, exotic locations, ridiculously extended stunt
sequences, bad puns and gadgets galore, shaken martinis _ it all
spells big box office. The last two outings, ``GoldenEye'' and
``Tomorrow Never Dies,'' each grossed around $350 million
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   You don't mess with that kind of success much. But for his third
outing as supersuave Agent 007, Pierce Brosnan wanted to at least,
well, feel something.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this one, we've hit a new chord, or at least one I
haven't hit in the last two movies,'' the 46-year-old Irish actor
reckons. ``I think we've gone back to what the original premise of
the character was in some respects. And at the beginning of this
one, I said that I couldn't do another `Tomorrow Never Dies.' I
wanted to do what's important to the character, what his
relationships mean to him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``World's'' plotline sends Bond out to the Caspian Sea republic
of Azerbaijan, where Elektra King (French actress Sophie Marceau),
the beautiful heiress to an oil- company fortune, is trying to
build a pipeline to the West through Asia Minor. It's presumed
Russian interests might be behind attempts to sabotage the project
and the successful assassination of Elektra's father.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever is really pulling the strings has hired the most
implacable of cat's-paws, Valentin Zukovsky (``The Full Monty's''
Robert Carlyle). The ruthless Russian has a bullet lodged in his
skull that is slowly killing him. But it also makes him impervious
to pain, which renders him a particularly hard guy to frighten or
fight. Eventually, everyone from Bond's boss M (Judi Dench) to
halter-topped American nuclear scientist Christmas Jones (``Wild
Things'' vixen Denise Richards) gets in on the action.
</P>
<P>
   But, wait! Didn't Brosnan say he wanted this film to be more
than just action? That, one reckons, is why somebody called Michael
Apted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose the reason I was brought in was to try to beef up
the drama a little bit, maybe concentrate on story a bit more,''
says the English documentarian and director of such fact-based
feature films as ``Coal Miner's Daughter'' and ``Gorillas in the
Mist.'' ``I think that's why they wanted a drama director rather
than an action director, although I still wondered why they wanted
to see me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bond franchise already had a longstanding team of
craftspeople in place, and Apted was happy to leave much of the
wide-scope action footage _ a powerboat chase down the Thames
River, the series' umpteenth ski sequence in the French Alps _ to
Terry Madden's capable second-unit crew (which shot 104 days to the
Apted unit's 109).
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, you have to deliver what people want; you can't
start changing it to Chekhov,'' Apted notes. ``After doing the
kinds of films that I've done, it was thrilling to be given these
new challenges. I was very dependent on other people _ the stunt
coordinator, the special effects coordinatior _ but once you kind
of got the hang of it, it was really exciting to add that string to
your bow, as it were.''
</P>
<P>
   The documentary-maker in Apted also influenced ``World's''
somewhat unorthodox definition of exotic locales. Instead of the
standard Mediterranean or tropical settings, he took the film to
the polluted oilfields of the former Soviet Caucasus and to Bilbao,
Spain, where the acclaimed new Guggenheim Museum could dominate the
opening scene's background.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days, exotic was being on a beach, but that's not
exotic anymore,'' Apted figures. ``When I saw these huge oil cities
built on the Caspian, and the Guggenheim, that redefined exotic for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The operating question was, however, how much redefinition can
such a formula-dependent enterprise take?
</P>
<P>
   ``You're never sure what all the elements are to a Bond movie's
success,'' admits Michael G. Wilson, who with step-sister Barbara
Broccoli has been producing Bond films since before the death of
series originator Albert ``Cubby'' Broccoli. ``It's always
difficult, especially because we look at a variety of different
territories. The United States is only 25 to 30 percent of our
income, and you never know from one territory to another what will
or won't play for different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose you learn from your mistakes, but it's a little
harder to learn from your successes,'' Wilson continues. ``The
temptation, when you do research, is to hear what people like about
the film and to give them more, and that's usually where film
series fall apart. People will tell you what they remember about
our films, and it's action and gadgets and stuff like that. But
that's all they remember; they won't verbalize the fact that you
have a good story. But I've found that if you don't have a good
story, people will say that the picture doesn't work for them,
though they won't be able to say why.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds right. Still, Apted felt obliged to shovel on all the
elements people keep going back to James Bond movies for.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, you do the best you can with it, and if my casting
Denise Richards as a nuclear scientist makes some sleazebags laugh,
then fine,'' the director says a bit testily. ``But I have to
deliver that, I have to deliver the jiggle-vision, if you will,
like I have to deliver action and gadgets and all that. The
challenge is, can I push it and make it more interesting and more
entertaining? Nonetheless, there are certain definite features I
have to deliver.''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, the not-known-for-her-rocket-science-skills
Richards is fielding the inevitable snickers good-naturedly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talk a lot about defusing bombs in the movie, and people
have been kidding me about it,'' the glamorous actress
acknowledges. ``But I was kind of expecting that. Traditionally,
though, the women in Bond films haven't just been armpieces.
They've all been smart and most of them have had great jobs _
they're either spies or doctors or scientists. That's what's fun
about it, to be able to play a smart woman who also gets to do all
of these things. It's great to be a part of the whole history of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nice for the statuesque physicist. But there are limits,
apparently, to how fully a fantasy figure such as 007 can be
humanized.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a delicate balance,'' Brosnan admits. ``You shouldn't
find out too much about Bond personally, because the great joy of
the character is the mystique of the character. If you read Ian
Fleming's books, you glean an awful lot about him in some respects.
But he is very solitary and, above all else, a survivalist. He's
always been a ruthless killer; maybe now he's a little more
vulnerable with women.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't think he's a gentler Bond,'' Brosnan is quick to
add, lest diehard fans become alarmed. ``He's been doing his job a
long time now and he's seen a lot of killing; his life is always
under threat. Maybe he's just a bit more philosophical now than he
was before.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it is, Brosnan's interest in the character has been
sufficiently renewed for him to scotch the rumors that ``World''
will be his last Bond outing. Apted, too, had enough fun to
consider directing another franchise entry, even with the attendant
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   As for the further future of the most profitable movie series of
all time, it remains to be seen if the formula's welcome will ever
wear out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It endures and keeps itself fresh because of two phenomena,''
producer Wilson reckons. ``One is that we are contemporary films,
so as we go through time the world changes and Bond changes with
it. The other thing is that we recast the series from time to time,
and that rejuvenates it because the actors are all leading men who
bring their strong personalities to it _ which, in a way, creates
new variations on the character.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing's indefinitely open-ended, though,'' Wilson concludes.
``I think we're just as good as our last movie and that's about the
way it is. We'll come to an end some time, but I think the
character will always be around because, like Sherlock Holmes or
Superman, he's just one of those fictitious characters that
captures the public's imagination.'' &QL;

CHAIR OF HEWLETT-PACKARD TO BECOME CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF WINERY

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For months the speculation on Lewis E. Platt,
who retires as chairman of Hewlett-Packard Co. at the end of the
year, has been that he would join a venture capital firm, a medical
instrument company, or perhaps an Internet start-up.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. Platt will join Kendall-Jackson Wine Estates Ltd. as
chief executive on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Hiring Platt, who is 58, is the latest and most dramatic step
Kendall-Jackson has taken to bolster its executive ranks, though
Jess Jackson, the company's founder and principal owner, is himself
regarded as one of the most savvy and aggressive managers in the
wine industry. A San Francisco lawyer, Jackson started his family
wine business in 1982. Jackson, who is 69, will continue as
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Jackson said he was creating Kendall-Jackson Wine
Estates by merging the Kendall-Jackson Winery with the Artisans &AMP;
Estates collection of ultra-premium wineries, also owned by the
Jackson family, which includes Hartford Court, Lokoya, Cardinale,
Legacy, Cambria and Stonestreet. The new company also owns a
barrel-making concern in France and a California-based distribution
company.
</P>
<P>
   Since the initial public offerings of Robert Mondavi Corp. in
1993 and Beringer Wine Estates in 1997, industry analysts have
suggested that Kendall-Jackson, based in Santa Rosa, Calif., would
be next. Though the company keeps saying that no deal is imminent,
Tuesday's announcement was broadly interpreted to mean just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is obviously part of a plan to dress up the company for
Wall Street,'' said Marvin R. Shanken, editor and publisher of The
Wine Spectator, a wine magazine. ``Whatever the reason, it's a
big-time show of strength and commitment. The level of expertise
and experience of Platt is unprecedented for a California winery.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, wineries have tended to recruit from a fairly narrow
range of beverage and hospitality industry executives; up until
now, Kendall-Jackson has been no different. In September, Alfred W.
Rossow, 66, joined the company as chief financial officer from
Boston Beer Co., makers of Samuel Adams. And in September 1998,
Leonard Cairney, 53, joined the winery from Beaulieu Vineyards as
president. He continues as chief operating officer of the new
company.
</P>
<P>
   For Platt, joining Kendall-Jackson turns an avocation into a
second career. ``Ever since coming to California in 1980, I
developed an interest in wine, which has grown over time and
actually become a big part of my nonwork life,'' he said in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes to help Kendall-Jackson build its sales outside the
United States, and, not surprisingly, to use information technology
to improve the company's internal operations.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding an initial public offering, Platt said, ``no decision
has been made. But obviously, that will be something that we will
be looking at as a way to continue to let the company grow. They
have been acquiring properties and expanding, and we would like to
continue the growth while maintaining the quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall-Jackson hiring Platt ``is a sure indication that this is
now a very important industry,'' said Tom Pirko, president of
Bevmark, a beverage industry consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall-Jackson, including the Artisans brands, sold 3.7 million
cases of wine in 1998, for estimated revenue of about $360 million.
For 1999, the company estimates that case volume will be slightly
down, because of a short grape harvest, but revenue will remain
flat because the company was able to raise prices on some wines.
</P>
<P>
   At Hewlett-Packard, Platt will be succeeded as chairman by
Richard Hackborn, a former Hewlett executive and board member. He
was replaced as president and chief executive by Carleton Fiorina,
who joined Hewlett in July.

   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ It was a familiar scene: President Clinton
consoling disaster victims, promising a swift rebuilding effort and
pledging federal assistance. The difference Tuesday was that the
disaster in question struck halfway around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Using the same approach he employs after hurricanes, tornadoes
and other disasters close to home, Clinton visited a tent city
about 50 miles east of Istanbul set up for survivors of the
earthquake that struck in August, killing more than 17,000. Another
earthquake on Friday struck Duzce, 115 miles east of Istanbul,
killing 547 people and injuring 3,300, the Turkish government said
Tuesday.

   In a camp inhabited by 9,000 victims on the outskirts of the
town of Izmit, Clinton bounced a baby in his arms, sipped Turkish
coffee in one family's tent and listened attentively as survivors
described their struggles in the aftermath of the quake.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the most difficult thing about living in this tent?''
Clinton asked a woman holding an infant inside her living quarters.
She complained of the cold weather outside and humidity inside. The
green military-style tent, normally used to shelter 10 soldiers,
had become the temporary home for 17 members of the Gencenler
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're grateful for you letting us into your home,'' Clinton
said as he exited. As a steady rain fell, he strolled through the
encampment with his wife, Hillary, and the Clintons' daughter,
Chelsea. At one point Chelsea held a 2-year-old boy named Betul in
her lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a beam fall and the next thing I knew I awoke in the
hospital,'' Ismail Yoldas, the father of three children, told the
Clintons of the moment the August earthquake struck. Yoldas
expressed his ``honor and happiness to meet the president.'' His
twin daughters smiled and answered yes when Mrs. Clinton asked if
they liked the makeshift school set up in the camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to Clintion,'' said a hand-painted sign written by a
young boy in the kindergarten tent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children of America are thinking of you,'' Clinton told
the 20 youngsters packed inside for lessons. After a brief
translation from the teacher, the children thanked Clinton in
unison and then sang a Turkish children's song about a little bird.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reassured the earthquake survivors who excitedly
surrounded him that the American government would pitch in to help
them rebuild their lives. Already, the United States has donated
$14.5 million as well as thousands of tents, blankets, rolls of
plastic sheeting and portable latrines. In a grim reminder of the
earthquake's wrath, the U.S. government has also shipped 10,000
body bags.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could imagine what our lives would be like if such a thing
were to happen to us, as we have seen it happen to families in the
United States,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of last week's second earthquake further east
in Duzce, Clinton said, an additional 500 military tents were sent
along to provide thousands of victims with shelter through the
winter.
</P>
<P>
   To promote rebuilding efforts in both quake sites, Clinton said
that the Federal Emergency Management Agency would help train local
officials in disaster response and that the Export-Import Bank
would extend $1 billion in loan guarantees to companies that invest
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also used the earthquake, one aide said, to engage in
``seismic diplomacy'' to try to ease regional tensions. Large
earthquakes in both Turkey and Greece have prompted rare
cooperation between the longtime antagonists, a process that
Clinton said had created ``a genuine opportunity for fundamental
and enduring reconciliation between your two lands.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On the third day of a 10-day swing through southeastern Europe,
Clinton used every chance he could to encourage Turks to put past
animosities aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were so impressed that a total of 87 other countries came
forward to help the people of Turkey who were hurt in the
earthquake,'' Clinton told a gathering of quake survivors and
relief workers after his tour of Izmit. ``And we were very grateful
that one of the countries that came forward to help was your
neighbor, Greece. And then, when the Greeks had their earthquake,
the Turkish people came forward to help them.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's main message to the victims was similar to the one he
delivers at every disaster scene, whether it is a North Carolina
town ravaged by a hurricane, a string of communities in Arkansas
leveled by a tornado or a distant nation ravaged by a killer quake.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will stay with you and work with you,'' Clinton said. ``I
just want to urge you to keep your spirits up, keep the smiles on
your children's faces, keep helping the people who lost their loved
ones in the earthquake and know that together we will get through
this to better days.''

 &HT;    Georgia Baptists oust 2 churches
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MACON, Ga. _ In an unprecedented move, Georgia Baptists meeting
at the Coliseum in Macon, Ga., expelled two Atlanta churches
Tuesday for ordaining homosexuals and condoning same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   In separate actions, messengers to the annual meeting of the
Georgia Baptist Convention voted 2,086 to 262 to exclude Decatur's
Oakhurst Baptist Church and 2,111 to 228 to remove Atlanta's
Virginia-Highland Baptist Church from convention rolls. The
convention represents 1.3 million Baptists in more than 3,415
congregations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Georgia Baptist Convention encourages, indeed urges, our
churches to minister to everyone including homosexuals,'' the Rev.
Robert White, the convention's executive director, said in
explaining a recommendation by the convention's executive committee
to cut ties to Oakhurst and Virginia-Highland. ``The problem is
what is the church's disposition toward the sin of homosexuality?
Does your church minister to homosexuals . . . or does your church
go beyond that to honor the sin of homosexuality?''
</P>
<P>
   At Oakhurst, gays and lesbians serve as Sunday school teachers,
choir members, deacons and ministers. Virginia-Highland was once
the site of a same-sex blessing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that honoring homosexuality in this way is an
error,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Oakhurst and Virginia-Highland pride themselves on their
openness, which their pastors say is a response to the urban
communities in which they are located.
</P>
<P>
   ``This community of faith owes an apology to no one for its
ministries and for its witness as a church on mission,'' the Rev.
Timothy Shirley, pastor of Virginia-Highland, told the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ministry that lesbian and gay Christians offer so joyfully
to our church is a blessing and a crucial part of the life of this
congregation,'' said the Rev. Lanny Peters, pastor of Oakhurst.
</P>
<P>
   The votes for expulsion came after messengers refused a request
by Peters for a period of reconciliation and conversation among the
state's Baptist churches about the issue of homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our church has been in dialogue for 20 years about
homosexuality,'' he said. ``We do not believe such an important
matter should be dealt with in 10 minutes at this convention.''
</P>
<P>
   Urging the convention to ``draw a line in the sand, written in
blood,'' the Rev. James Merritt, pastor of First Baptist Church in
Snellville, said, ``The issue before us is not homosexuality. . . .
The issue before us is fidelity to the truth of the word of God.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Rev. Chris Graham, pastor of the Church of the Savior in
Roswell, cautioned, ``There are people here today who have gay
children, gay grandchildren and who work with people who are gay.
They will go home with the question where, in this great body of
Christ that we uphold, where will those children, those
grandchildren, those friends find a home?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oakhurst and Virginia-Highland need the Georgia Baptist
Convention,'' he said, ``but you are mistaken today if you don't
think this convention needs Virginia-Highland Baptist Church in
Atlanta and Oakhurst Baptist Church in Decatur.''
</P>
<P>
   After the vote, Harris told a news conference, ``What we have
done today has been a grevious thing for all of us to go through.''
But, he said, ``we need to love people enough to correct them and
encourage them and discipline them.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris said he knows of no other churches facing action by the
convention. ``We don't have anyone who is monitoring churches or
looking for churches to exclude,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both ministers and lay members of Virginia-Highland and Oakhurst
said the convention's decision will make little practical
difference in their operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our church will go on. Our ministries will continue,'' said
Shirley.

PETER F. DRUCKER: AN OLD MASTER, STILL SLAMMING THE CORPORATE
ORDER

 By FRED ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Corporate America and Dr. Peter Ferdinand Drucker have fallen
out of favor with each other. Drucker still has his disciples, but
at the bleeding edge of business the old master's lifework is
commonly seen as simplistic, portentous, off the mark, idealistic,
out of date. Not for 20 years have the corporate world's heavy
hitters hung on his every word.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, The Man Who Invented Corporate Society (a
biographer's apt label) disdains a corporate order that is in
thrall to stock prices and that rewards its chief executives as
though they were power forwards. ``Earnings per share'' does not
exist in Peter Drucker's vocabulary. The religion of shareholder
supremacy has him shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's right, I am not very happy with the unbalanced emphasis
on stock price and market cap and short-term earnings,'' Drucker
said in an interview last week. ``The most critical management job
is to balance short term and long term. In the long term, today's
one-sided emphasis is deleterious and dangerous.'' (The saving
grace, he added, is that many companies pay lip service to
short-term shareholder interests. ``Actually, they are much better
managed,'' he said.)
</P>
<P>
   To his thinking, two personages, the customer and the highly
skilled employee, are at least as precious as the investor.
Increasingly, as pension beneficiaries, owners of stock options or
mutual fund investors, they are one and the same person. Learning
to balance these divergent but ultimately shared interests is ``the
challenge of the next 10 years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some 45 years ago Drucker declared a celebrated premise. ``There
is only one valid definition of business purpose: to  &UR; create a
customer &LR; .'' Does that premise still pertain? ``What else?'' he
asked. ``Who else pays the bills?'' From that conviction has come
his creed: Value and service first, profit later. Maximizing
profit, perhaps never.
</P>
<P>
   Drucker will turn 90 on Friday. If he lived in Japan (where he
has many devoted adherents), he might be denominated a living
National Treasure. What he has lost among the business elite as a
guru, he has picked up among the public as a civic essayist. For 30
years, he said, he has been writing as much for those who manage
the nonprofit world as for those in the corporate ranks.
</P>
<P>
   At latest count, he has written 31 books, most still in print.
In his 90th year, he has published a vigorously prescriptive book
(``Management Challenges for the 21st Century,'' HarperBusiness,
1999), graced The Atlantic's cover and was the featured essayist in
The Economist's annual issue on the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, Drucker gave the global bankers the back of his hand:
They have introduced not ``a single major innovation in 30 years,''
he said. Rather, the financial industry has turned inward to
perfecting ``supposedly `scientific' derivatives,'' in a
shortsighted hope of wringing the risk out of financial
speculation, like Las Vegas gamblers futilely trying to devise
``systems'' to beat the house.
</P>
<P>
   Drucker's intellectual vitality is breathtaking. His earliest
management study, ``The Concept of the Corporation,'' a scholarly
reflection on General Motors, dates back to the Truman presidency.
His latest reflections, in the Atlantic cover essay, take aim at
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Drucker knows how to put a high gloss on things. He writes that
only now, with the explosive emergence of e-commerce as a sales
channel for goods and services, is ``the truly revolutionary impact
of the Information Revolution beginning to be felt.'' Like the
railroad at the industrial dawn, e-commerce is ``totally new,
totally unprecedented, totally unexpected.''
</P>
<P>
   In its day, the railroad drastically altered the conception of
distance that people carried in their heads. ``In the mental
geography of e-commerce, distance has been eliminated,'' Drucker
writes. ``There is only one economy and only one market.'' That's a
game effort, but ``portentous'' may be the right word: ``full of
unspecifiable significance; exciting wonder and awe.''
</P>
<P>
   Drucker has been chucking for half a century. Like Orel
Hershiser, sometimes the fading champion has his stuff, sometimes
he hasn't. Like others in his line of work, Drucker draws lessons
from his consulting engagements. He is not above ``improving'' on
the facts to sharpen a point.
</P>
<P>
   Yet nowhere today is there a business prophet as inspirational
as Peter Drucker in full stride. This is a man who absorbed
management across the desk from Alfred P. Sloan, the General Motors
patriarch, who invented the modern corporation. Drucker's widely
influential work, ``The Practice of Management,'' was published
during Eisenhower's first term. His opus, ``Management: Tasks,
Responsibilities, Practices,'' became a best seller three decades
ago, before OPEC's ascendancy, before the Japanese auto invasion.
(Though it deals respectfully with Japan, the 839-page tome does
not mention Toyota.)
</P>
<P>
   To young business readers of earlier decades, he seemed a
halogen intellect, original and erudite, supremely confident,
applying a searchlight to the ordinary routines of business. Though
his grand models were Sears, Marks &AMP; Spencer, General Motors and
IBM, Drucker was capable of a lyrical riff on the 19th-century
Indian Civil Service, the 1,000 or so young Englishmen who brought
order to India in a triumph of middle management. The very quality
of his attention elevated management to a calling, ``the most
important function in American society.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Drucker taught that a manager's success lay in an acute grasp of
what the business was really all about, usually a grasp of its
contribution to the public good. One hero was Theodore Vail, father
of the Bell System, who was unusual among his turn-of-the-century
colleagues in concluding that fighting public regulation was a
no-win tack. He understood that the phone company's true product
was service. The Bell System flourished for more than half a
century because it provided that service with a dedication far
superior to anything conceivable in a state-owned enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, the trademark erudition and the organ music are
less lasting than the immense common sense. ``The Practice of
Management,'' pathfinding in its time, now reads musty and
antiquarian, with its instructive references to Packard Motor Car
Co. But a decade later, in ``Managing for Results,'' Drucker
chiseled a management guide for all seasons.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Results are obtained by exploiting opportunities, not by
solving problems. &LR;  What advice could be hoarier than that? Yet how
many established companies have embraced the opportunity of the
Internet, rather than feared the threat?  &UR; Any leadership position
is transitory and likely to be short-lived. ... What exists is
getting old. &LR;  Drucker was already preaching that a successful
company must cannibalize its own products, before the competition
does. The apostles of our New Economy were yet unborn.
</P>
<P>
   The pertinent question for managers, he wrote, ``is not how to
do things right but how to find the right things to do.'' It is
pure Drucker: Effectiveness always trumps efficiency. And this was
(and is) close to his heart: ``The one truly effective way to cut
costs is to cut out an activity altogether. There is little point
in trying to do cheaply what should not be done at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Drucker has kept abreast (or ahead) of the changing tides in
business. In 1985, he published ``Innovation and
Entrepreneurship,'' an entirely respectable treatment that by
today's IPO standards seems impossibly conservative. In a typical
page or so he ropes together 3M Co., the University of Berlin, the
Mayo Clinic and the March of Dimes. All that under ``Fustest with
the Mostest,'' a strategy the Internet has labeled ``first mover
advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the deepest pool of Druckerites is undoubtedly in the
social sector, a lifelong interest of increasing importance to
Drucker. In the nonprofit world, participants openly pursue the
greater good. And the social sector _ churches, hospitals, schools,
community service groups _ grows by leaps and bounds. With its
woeful management practices, the field was ripe for his
intellectual rigor. ``I see results,'' he said in the interview.
``The impact is much more direct. They need me more. They start out
from so much lower base.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the discipline of innovation,'' he lectured a
convocation of his followers. ``It means having a clear mission. It
means defining what you mean by results. It means the ability and
willingness to abandon where you don't get results. And then when
you find the real opportunity, the  &UR; unique &LR;  opportunity where you
can make the greatest difference,  &UR; zone &LR;  in on it, and reassess and
reassess and reassess.''
</P>
<P>
   Generous with his time and energy, Drucker has devoted a
substantial time to pro bono consulting. (Jack Beatty writes in
``The World According to Peter Drucker'' that to be taken
seriously, he has always charged nonprofits his usual fees, then
donated the check.)
</P>
<P>
   Most prominently he serves as guiding light to the Peter F.
Drucker Foundation for Nonprofit Management (www.pfdf.org), a group
in Manhattan that encourages effective management by recognizing
accomplishments by community organizations across the land. Its
work is impressively concrete and practical. Most likely it is
where we will find Peter Drucker's lasting monument.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Breakfast cost $1,000 inside the Texas Ballroom
at the Austin Hyatt, but the 300 or so well-tailored men and women
wearing ``Bush for President'' name tags Tuesday didn't seem to
mind.
</P>
<P>
   They are the top national fund-raisers for Republican
presidential candidate Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, and, not
surprisingly, many of them happily brought their checkbooks. ``Next
to my church,'' said John Mahaffey, the wealthy owner of a string
of radio stations, ``the most important thing I'm doing this year
is working for George W. Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Political fund raising is sometimes compared to squeezing water
out of rocks, but Bush's campaign has made it seem like the easiest
job in the world. With nearly $60 million raised so far, the Bush
team is already the most successful in political history. And
Tuesday, the campaign brought its financial supporters together for
the first time to say thank you in a day of private meetings that
seemed equal parts pep rally and strategy session.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is to recharge us to get out there and raise more
money,'' said Donna Tuttle, a former deputy secretary of commerce
under President Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   These might be considered rough times for the Bush campaign,
which to date has known few of them. The governor's commanding lead
in different polls has eroded in recent weeks, particularly in New
Hampshire, where Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has gained on him. And
he remains the butt of late-night TV jokes about his knowledge of
world leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But if they were not swaggering down the hallways of the Hyatt,
the people whose fund-raising efforts have been critical in helping
Bush establish his front-runner aura didn't appear very worried.
The word coming from the lips of men in the dark suits was
``energized.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the message is, `You've done a good job, keep it
up,''' said Matt Fong, a former U.S. Senate candidate in California
who is co-chairman of Bush's campaign there.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For a campaign rolling in money, a gathering of its biggest
rainmakers might be reason for extravagance. And though some of the
bell-hops pocketed nice tips, excess was hard to find. Each guest
got a signed copy of Bush's recently released autobiography, ``A
Charge To Keep,'' a video copy of upcoming campaign commercials and
a list of recommended local restaurants. For those who arrived on
Monday night, there was a reception at which Bush worked the room.
</P>
<P>
   Ray M. Goodman, a New York state senator who is also Manhattan
Republican Party chairman, said the thriftiness theme was
appreciated, even by an audience accustomed to corporate jets. In a
briefing Tuesday morning, officials said they had kept down costs
on salaries so that none of Bush's campaign employees were among
the 40 highest paid people working for any of the presidential
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advertising people were saying they don't even have
carpeting in the agency that has been set up,'' Goodman chuckled.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, campaign officials told the audience of plans to spend
the money on a sweeping media campaign that will initially target
12 states, including New Hampshire. In the briefing, the officials
said that even if McCain runs a close second in New Hampshire, or
possibly wins, they doubted he had enough money and resources to
significantly carry the fight into other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy looks like he's running on empty right now,'' Goodman
said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In conversations with several fund-raisers from different
states, nearly all of them said their jobs had been surprisingly
easy this year. Many had raised money in the past for the
governor's father, former President George Bush, or even Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask a lot,'' Ms. Tuttle said, ``let's face it, someone
says, `Omigosh, here comes another letter.''' But in the case of
Bush, she said her biggest problem was finding donors who hadn't
already given.
</P>
<P>
   The government limits contributions to an individual candidate
to $1,000 per person. But Tuesday's breakfast offered people who
have given the maximum to do it again, and do it legally, by
contributing to the campaign's general election legal and
accounting fund.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Edenfield, who worked as state campaign finance chairman in
Georgia for President Bush, said fund-raisers in Georgia had
already raised $1.7 million for the governor, more than double the
goal. He said 150 members of a state committee for Bush were asked
to ``exert best effort'' in raising $10,000 each, while the
governor has also appeared at three fund-raisers in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Edenfield dismissed the suggestion that Bush's coffers have
mostly been filled by wealthy donors and people tied to corporate
interests. He said the average donation in Georgia is $450, and he
said the fund-raising represents ``a pocketbook poll.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's ahead in fund raising because some people want him to be
president,'' he said.

   I have come to accept the fact that not all mice eat cheese.
Some of them crawl across computer screens and nibble at my icons.
</P>
<P>
   I have accepted the concept of glassless Windows, sneezeless
viruses, juiceless Apples, meatless spam and a fishless Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   But I cannot accept the proposition that a computer-driven robot
is capable of squeezing an avocado without leaving a bruise.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that is the apparent mission of corporations with names like
</P>
<P>
   Cabbages-for-Kings.com. These computer-driven companies are
supposed to do the shopping for homemakers who are otherwise
occupied walking their poodles, rearranging their Beanie Baby
collections or inventing a cure for the common cold.
</P>
<P>
   Well, they may do Bill Gates' grocery shopping, but they won't
do ours.

   Can you guess how long it takes Alice the Artist to complete her
shopping just in the produce section of her favorite supermarket?
It's a minimum of 30 minutes and she's not spending the time
watching the spray turn on and off over the lettuce bin.
</P>
<P>
   Say she is shopping for bananas. She wants one or two ripe
enough to eat that day but she'll add four or five unripe ones, for
future consumption. No, she doesn't buy green-green bananas. As an
artist she is looking for a banana that is phthalo yellow-green on
the outside, cadmium lemon-yellow in the center. Set your shopping
bag down. This may take awhile.
</P>
<P>
   I don't buy ``a pound of fresh mushrooms.'' I'm looking for 20
or 30 beauties with clear complexions and short stems, each
whispering ``take me'' as I browse through the bin.
</P>
<P>
   I may juggle 10 or 15 yellow onions, before I select two of
them.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the easy part of shopping. Alice sometimes thinks she
will have to put my picture on a milk carton after I have wandered
off into the cheese section. When I am looking for inexpensive
pinot noirs, merlots or cabernets with decent Wine Spectator
ratings, it may take longer than a liver transplant.

   If you think this sounds like work, then you should do your
shopping on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping can be pure entertainment. You've heard of ``The Joy of
Cooking.'' It has been said that ``joy'' is 90 percent
anticipation, 10 percent realization. Every step down a shopping
aisle, I'm anticipating. Some days I may anticipate some:
</P>
<P>
   Pizza Mac
</P>
<P>
   1 pound lean ground beef
</P>
<P>
   1 large onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 green pepper, chopped
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon garlic salt
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon Italian herbs
</P>
<P>
   \ teaspoon black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 14-ounce jar pizza sauce
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces uncooked macaroni
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces pepperoni, sliced
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese
</P>
<P>
   Every supermarket has a special on ``our leanest ground beef.''
OK, how lean is it? You have to closely inspect the label for fat
content. Is the meat red, gray or some obscene shade in between?
You have to ``be there,'' man! You can't leave a decision like this
to computer clerks.
</P>
<P>
   After you have made the big decision go home, get out a large
skillet, then moosh together the ground beef, onion and green
pepper in the pan. Cook over high heat until meat is no longer red.
Pour off any pan fats.
</P>
<P>
   OK, add to the pan the garlic salt, Italian herbs (oregano and
basil), the black pepper and the pizza sauce. Simmer everything,
covered, 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Cook the macaroni in boiling water, according to package
instructions. Drain the pasta and add it to the contents of the
skillet. Stir everything around and then pour into a lightly
greased 8-by-12 oven dish. Scatter the pepperoni over the top.
</P>
<P>
   Shove the casserole into a 350-degree oven for 25 minutes.
Remove, scatter the cheese over the top, and return casserole to
oven for 5 minutes more.
</P>
<P>
   Serves four to six.
</P>
<P>
   Banana-Chocolate Chip Cookies
</P>
<P>
   1{ cups flour
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon baking soda
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon ground cloves
</P>
<P>
   { cup canola oil
</P>
<P>
   1 firmly packed cup brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 eggs
</P>
<P>
   2 ripe bananas, mashed
</P>
<P>
   1 cup uncooked oatmeal
</P>
<P>
   { cup raisins
</P>
<P>
   { cup chocolate chips
</P>
<P>
   { cup chopped walnuts
</P>
<P>
   The bananas in this recipe have to be ``mashable.'' If this
stumps you, call Alice. She'll run down to the market and pick out
a couple for you.
</P>
<P>
   Dump the first five ingredients into a mixing bowl. Well, don't
just stand there. Mix!
</P>
<P>
   Combine the sugar and canola oil in a beater bowl. Well, don't
just sit there. Beat, until creamed. Dump in the eggs and mashed
bananas and beat again, until ingredients are thoroughly combined.
</P>
<P>
   Stir in the flour mixture, plus the oatmeal, raisins, chocolate
chips and walnuts.
</P>
<P>
   When everything is combined, drop tablespoons full of batter 1{
inches apart on a greased cookie sheet. Or you can make the cookies
larger, if you want.
</P>
<P>
   Bake at 350 degrees for about 15 minutes, or until browned
around the edges, then enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   What you have here is science with a smile.

BOY CONVICTED OF SECOND-DEGREE MURDER IN KILLING COMMITTED WHEN HE
WAS 11 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTIAC, Mich. _ A state jury on Tuesday found a boy guilty of
second-degree murder for a killing he committed when he was 11. He
is believed to be the youngest American ever tried and convicted of
murder as an adult, in a case that has highlighted a national trend
toward putting children on trial as adults.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, all but six states have adopted new juvenile justice
laws that allow more children to be tried as adults, with Michigan
adopting one of the toughest statutes of all in 1996. Civil
liberties and human rights groups have opposed these laws,
contending that treating children as adults will turn them into
hardened criminals.
</P>
<P>
   But many state-level Republican politicians have led campaigns
for adult trials and long prison sentences for juvenile offenders,
using the slogan, ``adult crime, adult time.'' Michigan Gov. John
Engler, a Republican, welcomed Tuesday's verdict, saying that
11-year-olds were mature enough to understand the seriousness of
firing a gun.
</P>
<P>
   The convicted boy, Nathaniel Abraham, was 11 years and 9 months
old when he went out on a hillside here in this northern suburb of
Detroit on the evening of Oct. 29, 1997. He used a borrowed,
.22-caliber rifle to shoot a stranger who was walking out of a
convenience store, killing him with a single bullet in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel could receive a sentence of up to life in prison. But
prosecutors said they would ask that he be incarcerated initially
in a juvenile detention center and reassessed at ages 19 and 21 to
determine whether he had been rehabilitated enough for release or
should be sent to a prison for adults.
</P>
<P>
   The jury acquitted Nathaniel of first-degree murder, which would
have required the prosecution to prove him guilty of planning the
killing. But while the judge in the case, Judge Eugene Moore, gave
the jury the option of finding Nathaniel guilty of involuntary
manslaughter, the jury ended up choosing instead the charge of
second-degree murder, which requires proof that the killing was
intentional.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that he knew the firearm was dangerous,'' said jury
foreman Daniel Stolz. The jury deliberated for four days before
reaching a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel, who was impassive during the trial, appeared shaken
but did not cry when the verdict was read. ``He doesn't understand
it, he literally never has,'' said Geoffrey Fieger, a prominent
lawyer who defended Nathaniel for free. Fieger contended during the
trial that Nathaniel lacked the mental capacity to be held
responsible for his actions. Court-appointed psychologists found
that Nathaniel had below-average intelligence for his age and
limited ability to control anger.
</P>
<P>
   Fieger said his law firm had checked with officials in all 50
states and found that Nathaniel was the first American ever tried
for murder as an adult and convicted for a killing at such a young
age. But Melissa Sickmund, a senior research associate at the
National Center for Juvenile Justice, a non-profit group in
Pittsburgh, was more cautious about declaring Nathaniel the
youngest, citing a paucity of state and federal statistics on very
young offenders. A federal report earlier this autumn on juvenile
justice noted that children as young as seven were tried as adults
during the eighteenth century.
</P>
<P>
   The jury here in Oakland County Circuit Court acquitted
Nathaniel, who now 13 years old, three other charges, including
felony possession of a firearm during the murder. Fieger said he
would file a motion within a week asking Moore to overturn the
guilty verdict on the second-degree murder charge, on the grounds
that Nathaniel should not be found guilty of fatally shooting
someone while acquitted of possessing a gun to fire the shot.
</P>
<P>
   But Patricia Mell, a professor of criminal law at Michigan State
University, questioned whether the motion would be successful.
``Just because verdicts are inconsistent doesn't necessarily mean
that they're overturned,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary hearing on the sentencing was scheduled for Dec.
14. But Lisa Halushka, the assistant Oakland County prosecutor who
handled the case, said that it was likely to be postponed because
various trial records needed to be prepared and Nathaniel might
need to be interviewed again by a court-appointed psychologist.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Fieger said he believed that race had played a role in the
prosecution and conviction of Nathaniel, who is black. Oakland
County is only 8 percent black, and was mainly settled in the 1960s
and 1970s by whites fleeing Detroit, which is now three-quarters
black. There was only one black, an elderly man, on Nathaniel's
jury; the jury had seven women and five men.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Halushka strongly denied that race had played any role.
</P>
<P>
   Fieger indirectly acknowledged during the trial that Nathaniel
had fired the shot that killed the stranger, Ronnie Greene Jr., who
was 18 at the time of his death, and who was black. Fieger said
Nathaniel had been shooting at trees, and that Greene's death had
been a tragic accident.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, Fieger contended that Nathaniel was 288 feet
from Greene at the time of the shooting, and could not have hit him
deliberately at such a distance with the rifle, which was 30 years
old and missing its stock. Defense witnesses also suggested that
the bullet entered Greene's head so far above the hairline that the
bullet must have ricocheted off a tree branch overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Halushka offered a very different account during the trial.
She said that Nathaniel was only 200 feet from Greene, and that
Nathaniel had used balloons for target practice during the days
before Greene's death. Prosecution witnesses also contended that
Greene's bullet wound was consistent with his having tilted his
head at the moment of impact, and did not indicate that the bullet
had struck him from above. Nathaniel was firing from a steep
hillside overlooking the convenience store.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Michigan is one of the leaders in a move by Republicans to allow
ever younger children to be tried as adults with a judge's
permission and for an ever lengthening list of crimes. A
three-year-old state law allows prosecutors to ask judges for
permission to try any youth as an adult, no matter how young. Until
the law was passed, children had to be at least 14 to be tried as
an adult with a judge's permission. Other states have also been
lowering this age to as young as 10.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan has long mandated that anyone 17 or older be tried
automatically as an adult, unlike many other states and the federal
government, which require that a defendant be at least 18 to be
automatically considered an adult. While Michigan once had a
reputation for liberalism, the state's increasingly conservative
Republican Party now controls the state's House and Senate, as well
as the governor's mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Halushka said that Tuesday's verdict would make sure that
Nathaniel would receive treatment and not pose a risk to society.
But Fieger predicted that Oakland County would be ridiculed for
Tuesday's decision, adding, ``The rest of the world will rightfully
scorn this and hold us in contempt.''
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International U.S.A., the American arm of the global
human rights group, condemned Tuesday's verdict. ``As America
exhorts other nations to uphold basic human rights principles, we
should begin with the ABC's of human rights and treat our own young
offenders as children _ not as adults,'' said Curt Goering, the
American group's senior deputy executive director.

 &HT;    EGYPTAIR PILOT'S FAMILY OUTRAGED AT SUGGESTION OF SUICIDE
 &HT;    With Photo.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ Still in disbelief that her pilot husband is
dead, Omyama Mahmoud Fahmy says it is unimaginable the he would
bring down an airplane on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm shocked. I don't believe he would do anything like that. I
don't doubt. I know it. Not him. Not any pilot,'' Fahmy said.
</P>
<P>
   Fahmy's husband, Gamil Hamid El-Batouty, is among the pilots
suspected by authorities considering whether a murder-suicide
solves the riddle of the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990, which killed
217 people.
</P>
<P>
   Television news reports late Tuesday showed Batouty as the focal
point of the probe by National Transportation Safety Board
investigators. The mere suggestion, however, outrages members of
his family, who call it everything from an anti-Islam insult to a
cover-up by the airplane's manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators Tuesday were keying on a recording from the
cockpit that reportedly indicates the pilot left the cockpit and
someone else uttered a Muslim prayer before the airplane began a
fatal dive.
</P>
<P>
   Without an apparent mechanical or weather-related cause of the
crash, the NTSB Tuesday considered handing the case over to the FBI
as a possible criminal matter but delayed its decision so Egyptian
experts can have more time to review the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Batouty had been in a first-class seat as part of the crew that
would take over midway through the New York-Cairo flight.
</P>
<P>
   Cairo newspapers Wednesday morning slammed those making
accusations against the pilots. It was quickly turning into a point
of national pride.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Egyptians, members of the Batouty family are outraged
at what they say is a rushed conclusion that a Muslim saying must
be a prelude to an act of terror.
</P>
<P>
   To them and others, the supposition smacked of an anti-Islam
bias and a national insult. Perhaps, they say, the Muslim
invocation came after pilots learned of a mechanical problem.
Muslims commonly repeat a prayer when faced with even small perils
or uncertainties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know these men. I know them very well. They are good pilots
and good men. None of them would be capable of this,'' said
EgyptAir pilot Roshdy Zakaria, who trained all five pilots on board
the flight. ``How do we know the prayer was not the prayer of a man
who was about to die.''
</P>
<P>
   NTSB chairman Jim Hall told a press conference Tuesday that his
investigators were building backgrounds of all five pilots on board
Flight 990.
</P>
<P>
   Fahmy, however, said she has not been contacted by any
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Though her husband was approaching his 60th birthday in
February, at which point he would have to retire, family members
said he had too many plans to take his own life.
</P>
<P>
   They say he had asked a son to meet him at the Cairo airport to
help carry two Michelin tires he had bought before leaving New
York. He had promised his 10-year-old daughter Aya a special gift.
</P>
<P>
   And there were the long-range plans. Batouty had invited friends
to a New Year's Eve party, marking also his 35th wedding
anniversary. He wanted to spend his retirement in a villa he had
bought in a Cairo suburb.
</P>
<P>
   In their apartment in the upscale Heliopolis neighborhood
Tuesday, the women of the family were dressed in black as they had
been since the crash. A picture of Batouty was on the wall and
another in a frame above the television. The living room was
decorated with a Asian vases and framed photos of the Batouty's
five children.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Fahmy, sat in a black dress and a gold necklace with a
turquoise scarab, the mythical Egyptian beetle meant to keep away
evil. Batouty gave it to her for their last anniversary. She wept
and said she will wear black the rest of her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have hope that he will come knock on my door,'' she
said through tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved flying,'' she said. ``He didn't take any days off
except when he went on the Haj.''
</P>
<P>
   The Haj is the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia, and
Batouty made it twice. As do most religions, Islam considers
suicide a shameful death.
</P>
<P>
   Fahmy said her husband was ``always happy,'' and never had so
much as a tooth pulled.
</P>
<P>
   Family members scoffed at the notion that Batouty ever had
psychological problems. He was, they said, a healthy, six-footer
with a barrel chest. He was also the son of a wealthy Nile Delta
family whose family name was now being smeared by what they called
a cover-up by airplane manufacturer Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Family members urged reporters to call his friends. They showed
two other tires he had brought from New York on a previous trip,
noting that he had stripped the label off one so he could match
them on his next trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a family man. He would never do this to his family,''
said Walid El-Batouty, a close cousin of the pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Family members of another suspect, co-pilot Adel Anwar, 37, were
not available Tuesday. But, he was headed home Oct. 31 for his
wedding, scheduled just a few days later.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmad al-Habashi, the pilot who may have left the cockpit
shortly before the flight went awry, was also hailed as a skilled
captain.
</P>
<P>
   Even the night after the crash, al-Habashi's brother Mohammed
sought out television cameras to offer apologies to family members
of the victims. He assured them that his brother was the ``most
disciplined pilot in this company.''

DUAL ROLES IN CONFLICT

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It wasn't supposed to work this way.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton's national visibility as first lady was expected
to provide her pending New York Senate campaign with invaluable
publicity that could not be matched by her Republican rival, a mere
mayor of New York City. Her initial forays into the state were
greeted with the adulation found most often these days only among
youthful readers of Harry Potter.
</P>
<P>
   But Rudolph Giuliani is making more political points in his own
day job thus far than Clinton has managed to do in hers.
</P>
<P>
   He is cleverly manipulating the task of running a big city by
taking policy positions that appeal to identifiable groups of
voters across the state. She, by contrast, has not yet mastered the
correct balance between fulfilling her public responsibilities as
the wife of a president and defending the interests of New York
state.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's dilemma was painfully evident during her
meeting on the West Bank last week with Suha Arafat, wife of the
Palestinian Authority leader. Clinton remained silent during
Arafat's inflammatory diatribe against Israel and only denounced
the remarks a day later, after clearing her reaction with the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani , with an eye on the Jewish 10 percent of New York's
population, sharply criticized her temporary timidity.
Traditionally, Democratic candidates need about two thirds of the
Jewish vote to win statewide in New York. (Jews were 12 percent of
the statewide vote in last year's U.S. Senate race and 23 percent
of the vote in the 1997 New York City mayoral race.) Recent polls
show Clinton getting about half of their vote despite the fact she
is in tune with more Jews on domestic issues than the mayor,
</P>
<P>
   Her West Bank gaffe promptly produced a round of stories about
sagging morale in her campaign, lethargic support among her allies
and such a lack of political savvy that she might not run after
all. The latter speculation comes mostly from people who didn't
want her to run anyway and can be dismissed as such.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact remains that Giuliani has been running an
aggressive, productive pre-campaign and she has not. He has the
advantage of not having to clear anything with anyone.
</P>
<P>
   He's on his own, which gives him the freedom to make decisions
based more on his campaign needs than on the interests of New York
City. Clinton, by contrast, is still linked to the Clinton
administration and caught between the conflicting pulls of loyalty
and independence.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is in its early days. Neither candidate has
officially declared, and although most polls give him an edge, it
is within the margin of error so that the two are in a statistical
dead heat. Surveys indicate so many people have already made up
their minds that the struggle could be over the hearts and minds of
fewer than 10 percent of the voters.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton has not lived up to her early promise. Perhaps a sag
in her standing was inevitable as reality set in. In March, when
her dominant image was that of noble, wronged wife, her statewide
approval rating stood at 52 percent. Now that she is seen as a
self-promoting candidate it has fallen to 37 percent in the latest
New York Times/CBS poll.
</P>
<P>
   She has had to fend off complaints about her lack of residence
in the state; the financing of her new house in New York, her
television commercials and campaign trips, and her waffling about
the president's clemency offer for convicted Puerto Rican
terrorists. Good news has been rare.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Giuliani has been busy. He has alienated some groups
but strengthened his image as a tough leader with others.
</P>
<P>
   His demand that the city withhold funds from the Brooklyn Museum
of Art for its display of a dung-splattered Virgin Mary was popular
with Catholics although a court ruled it unconstitutional
censorship. His crusade to force taxi drivers to pick up blacks and
travel to high-risk neighborhoods has been cheered by civil rights
groups.
</P>
<P>
   His insistence that the City Hall steps be closed to most
rallies has been challenged in court as violating the First
Amendment right to free speech, but many voters like the idea of
sustained order and calm at the doors of government.
</P>
<P>
   These actions affect only the city that he runs. But the
symbolism of a guy in charge who gets things done reaches the rural
counties and small towns of upstate New York, where both he and
Clinton are still essentially strangers.
</P>
<P>
   And although Giuliani has been sharply critical of her at every
opportunity, she has not responded with equal ferocity. If this is
a slugfest, she has yet to learn the right moves.
</P>
<P>
   The role of first lady normally calls for a demure manner and a
ladylike approach. But she must now be a candidate first and White
House spouse second.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, she has been sharp-tongued in defense of her
husband and his policies. But this is a different battlefield. To
win, she must carry her own banner and never let it fall, as she
did in the unfortunate West Bank episode.

SEPARATELY, STATE AND FEDERAL OFFICALS WEIGH OPTIONS ON MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mcd) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sometime in the next two or three months, a diverse
alliance of state and federal officials _ some elected, some
appointed, some Democrats, some Republicans _ must reach agreement
on one of the thorniest public policy issues of the day: What to do
with Microsoft Corp. if, as expected, a federal judge finds the
company guilty of violating the nation's antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most optimistic among them, Iowa Attorney General Tom
Miller, places the odds that all of them will agree at only
``something better than 50-50.'' After taking a back seat to the
Justice Department for most of the trial, some attorneys general
for the 19 states that are co-plaintiffs in the case may no longer
be content to let the federal lawyers drive the case solo through
the remedies stage.
</P>
<P>
   With the publication of Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's
exhaustive findings of fact on Nov. 5, a guilty verdict on at least
some of the counts seems inevitable. And the judge published a
schedule making it clear that he would hold a separate proceeding
of some sort to establish a remedy, which could range from forcing
Microsoft to rewrite some of its contracts to breaking up the
company.
</P>
<P>
   To get ready for that, the Justice Department and the attorneys
general are deliberating and investigating their options. While the
partner-plaintiffs have said they agree that the remedy must deal
in some way with the Windows operating system monopoly, there are
many paths that might achieve that goal. And while they are talking
to one another, they are operating on two wholly separate but
parallel tracks.
</P>
<P>
   If in the end, the Justice Department and the attorneys general
do not agree, most likely they will give the judge different,
possibly conflicting recommendations for a remedy _ hardly the most
effective way to present their case.
</P>
<P>
   For the states, the effort to reach consensus is complex.
Nineteen attorneys general are equal partners in the states' suit,
which was filed at the same time as the federal suit and combined
with it for trial.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys general are elected officials with the same pressures
and ambitions as any other pubic-office holder. And among the 19
are representatives of both major political parties and most every
possible political viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously it's a diverse group,'' said Miller, who is
directing the effort at devising a recommendation. ``But consensus
is important to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller holds a conference call every Monday with some of the
other attorneys general or their assistants to discuss developments
in the Microsoft case. Most of the discussion in the last few weeks
has involved remedy proposals.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the states have hired their own academic
consultants, ``and we talk to a fairly wide range of people
representing the best thinking we can find,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, he added, is for the states that participate in the
calls to try to reach a consensus on a remedy sometime early next
year. The judge's verdict is expected in February, with a remedy
proceeding shortly after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can reach a consensus,'' Miller said, ``we will take it
to the other attorney generals'' for a group discussion and vote.
That is the first hurdle, the one Miller said holds just better
than 50-50 odds for success.
</P>
<P>
   The next goal will be to take the states' recommendation to the
Justice Department to see if it can be made to work with the
federal government's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said, ``it's important that we not get in an adversarial
position with the federal government.''
</P>
<P>
   That may not be easy. Some of the attorneys general and their
aides, while grateful for the effective prosecution of the case,
say they no longer want to take a subordinate role to the Justice
Department and David Boies, the department's lead trial lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more tension between the states and Justice on
remedies than there was during the trial,'' said a senior aide to
one of the attorneys general. ``During the trial, we were mostly
just passengers, but now there are two different trains running on
parallel tracks.''
</P>
<P>
   Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor at the University of Iowa College
of Law who is advising the states, said be believed that the
attorneys generals generally face political pressures ``to propose
something different from what the federal government does.
Otherwise they will seem superfluos.'' He said those pressures may
surface in this case, too.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some of the states have the power to request
monetary damages on behalf of their citizens, something the Justice
Department cannot do. Some attorneys general have said they intend
to use that power.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said he often speaks informally with Joel Klein, head of
the antitrust division, and other department officials. But he
insisted that in those calls he cannot speak for the other
attorneys general.
</P>
<P>
   For the Justice Department, reaching a conclusion on a remedy
recommendation is made difficult principally because the issue is
complex. Every proposed remedy has its own significant attributes
and liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The department has been soliciting opinions from academics and
other anti-trust experts for more than a year. Timothy F.
Bresnahan, an economics professor at Stanford University, took a
leave from his job this summer to join the Justice Department staff
and help devise a remedy proposal.
</P>
<P>
   While still at Stanford, he solicited opinions and analyses on
remedy proposals from other economists and antitrust experts. The
inquiry had to remain informal because any organized effort would
run afoul of federal rules governing the establishment of advisory
committees.
</P>
<P>
   Now a small group of senior Justice Department officials is
studying these opinions and others, weighing their options. Before
making a decision, officials said, the White House will probably
want to be involved, since the recommendation is a major policy
decision, not a law enforcement matter. Until now, administration
officials said, White House officials have had no involvement in
the Microsoft case.
</P>
<P>
   If, in the end, the states and the federal government cannot
agree, the two plaintiffs will probably submit separate
recommendations to the judge. Trying to put the best face on that
possibility, Miller said: ``That wouldn't necessarily be bad. Maybe
our side will get two shots at it while Microsoft gets only one.''

GETTING TO KNOW THE SIGHTS AND SOUNDS OF DVD  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 21) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (af)  
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's odd about DVD. With three million players in use, the
digital video disc has emerged as the fastest growing format ever,
and that includes the audio CD and the videocassette.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, according to one industry study, 40 percent of the American
public doesn't know what DVD is. ``My mother doesn't,'' said Karen
Stetler, a producer at the Criterion Collection, a New York company
that turns out DVD special editions at the high end of a market
that is filling with thousands of titles.
</P>
<P>
   With that kind of an acquaintance gap, perhaps a primer is in
order, and for that there is no better authority than Criterion.
Years ago, operating in a former ballroom on the beach in Santa
Monica, Calif., the company made laser discs, those grand 12-inch
silver platters that brought films, often classic ones, to video
with superior clarity and sound and accompanied by supplemental
information _ interviews, documentaries, essays and the like _ that
helped explain the movie and how it was made. Now Criterion makes
five-inch DVDs, laser's advanced successor.
</P>
<P>
   Obscured in the '80s and '90s by the rise of the videocasette,
laser never became more than a niche for film buffs. By contrast,
DVD is regarded as the eventual replacement for the cassette. As
such it has the full attention of the studios, which are sprucing
up their films, new and old, for a digital format that not only
makes most tapes look like mud but, with vastly more space for
added features than laser disc, radically expands video for the
average viewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now there is a broader audience being introduced to this kind
of work,'' said Peter Becker, Criterion's president. Digital
compression has opened the possibilities. ``We're now able to do a
level of restoration and supplemental work that exceeds anything we
were able to do on laser,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously some films are better candidates for special treatment
than others. Criterion chooses classics and older movies from the
library of Janus Films, which includes the likes of Fellini,
Kurosawa, Renoir, Godard and Bergman.
</P>
<P>
   From its laser days the company has cultivated ties with
prominent directors like Martin Scorsese and, before his death in
1990, Michael Powell, and young ones like Kevin Smith (``Chasing
Amy'') and Paul Thomas Anderson (``Boogie Nights''), who studied
laser disc as a virtual adjunct to film school.
</P>
<P>
   Criterion divvies up its work among 30 producers and technical
experts in video, sound, design, compression and other areas.
``We're interested in good contemporary films that deserve special
treatments,'' Ms. Stetler said. For her, one example is David
Cronenberg's ``Dead Ringers,'' about a pair of identical twin
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The film moved to DVD with all its special laser features
reformatted for the digital disc, down to drawings and photographs
of the medical instruments and sculptures designed for the film.
Cronenberg, a notably private man, contributed an audio commentary.
``I thought his audience would be really interested in hearing from
him,'' Ms. Stetler said.
</P>
<P>
   At any one time, Criterion projects swing from, to name some
current examples, Alfred Hitchcock's ``The 39 Steps,'' Carol Reed's
``The Third Man'' and Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's ``The
Red Shoes'' to Scorsese's ``The Last Temptation of Christ'' and Wes
Anderson's ``Rushmore.''
</P>
<P>
   The first task is to locate the best film elements _ various
negatives and positives _ to work with on the transfer to a digital
master. ``Most of the films we do are old,'' said Maria Palazzola,
Criterion's ranking expert on the move from film to disc. ``I get
an itemized list from all over the world as to what elements
exist.''
</P>
<P>
   If some are missing, she jumps on a plane and goes looking. ``We
try to find as much as we can because if something is mislabeled or
has been in a vault a long time and is assumed to be good but
isn't, we're stuck,'' she said. Now and then even good material can
be improved upon. Renoir's ``Grand Illusion'' is an example. ``We
thought we had the best elements when we did the transfer for laser
disc,'' she said. ``Then for the DVD we found some better elements,
so we went to Paris and did a new transfer.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Directors and cinematographers often work at her shoulder during
the transfer. The cinematographer Jack Cardiff was on hand for the
transfer of ``The Red Shoes'' in London. ``That was a case where he
came in and made the film look like what he wanted on the theater
screen,'' Ms. Palazzola said.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Kubrick, who didn't travel, received ``rushes'' of each
day's transfer work on the laser discs of ``Lolita'' and ``Dr.
Strangelove.'' Scorsese sent his film editor, Thelma Schoonmaker,
to work on the DVD of ``The Last Temptation of Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schoonmaker also happens to be Michael Powell's widow, and
she and Scorsese supplied a trove of supplemental items for ``The
Red Shoes'' DVD, along with advice on where to find other
materials.
</P>
<P>
   Supplements, Ms. Stetler said, are primarily derived from four
sources: the filmmaker, the studio, libraries, archives from
museums and organizations like the British Film Institute. ``We
look for things that will enhance understanding of the movie,'' she
said. Directors often contribute the most. ``Scorsese saves
everything, so on `Last Temptation' he gave me huge amounts of
stuff,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Red Shoes'' comes with commentary by Cardiff and two stars
of the film, the dancer Moira Shearer and Marius Goring; many
stills from the set; a reading of the Hans Christian Andersen fairy
tale by Jeremy Irons, and an animated film of Hein Heckroth's
painted storyboards, which can be played split screen with the
film.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best aspects of DVD is sound. Up to nine soundtracks
are available on a disc. Becker stressed that each be used
appropriately or not at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Third Man'' includes a reading of Graham Greene's
treatment that became the film. For ``The 39 Steps,'' the Criterion
producer Susan Arosteguy went to Marian Keane, a Hitchcock expert
and former film professor of hers, for a commentary. ``Sometimes we
do a more scholarly reading of a film, rather than anecdotal,'' Ms.
Arosteguy said. ``It's a nice way to get you into Hitchcock's work
differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on the disc is the 1937 broadcast of the Lux Radio Theater
adaptation of the film, starring Robert Montgomery and Ida Lupino;
it is introduced with wonderful panache by Cecil B. DeMille.
</P>
<P>
   Sound work is a separate specialty. For newer films it generally
concentrates on making the film sound its best on the latest home
theater equipment. For older films, a forensic machine (the same
one that takes distortions out of wiretaps) is used to remove hiss,
crackle and clicks. ``The first principle is to do no harm,''
Becker said.
</P>
<P>
   All that is left, then, is to make sure that the viewer can
maneuver around the disc efficiently. For that there is the disc
designer's true pride and joy: the menu, or index of features.
Materials can be organized in many ways. ``What to do should be
clear, easy, geared to the film,'' Becker said. ``We don't want our
discs to be difficult.''

   LOS ANGELES _ Muffler men are the cigar-store Indians of the
late 20th century, trade figures made to stand in front of shops to
advertise what is sold inside.
</P>
<P>
   Both are considered forms of folk art, but the skinny metal
figures with shimmering muffler heads and torsos and pipe-thin legs
found outside auto repair shops are wittier, more imaginative and
flamboyantly painted than the stolid carved Indians of yesteryear.
</P>
<P>
   Today's metal icons depict cartoon characters, space creatures,
robots, cowboys, bikers, boxers, guitarists, devils and pop culture
images like John Lennon and Uncle Sam.

men are being made as advertising art, proliferating as roadside
attractions outside the shops throughout the Los Angeles
metropolitan area. Most are not for sale, and to deter theft, most
are either welded to a post or chained down.
</P>
<P>
   Their makers _ most are Hispanic _ repaint them frequently to
keep them looking shiny new. But they weather fast, lasting for no
more than a couple of years. So far, very few figures appear to
have survived long enough to show up in flea markets and art shows,
and that may explain why most people have no idea what muffler men
are.
</P>
<P>
   Now muffler men are moving into the world of art, in two
exhibitions at the Fowler Museum of Cultural History at the
University of California at Los Angeles. One of them, ``Muffler
Men, Munecos and Other Welded Wonders,'' which was organized by the
Fowler, is the first museum exhibition devoted entirely to these
figures.
</P>
<P>
   On display through April 28 are 34 metal images of people, space
creatures and animals. There are also two muffler figures at the
Fowler in ``Recycled, Re-Seen: Folk Art From the Global Scrap
Heap,'' a traveling exhibition organized in 1996 by the Museum of
International Folk Art in Santa Fe that closes on Jan. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't expect art in an auto repair shop,'' said Patrick A.
Polk, a curator of the ``Muffler Men'' show. ``But these figures
have been seen all over this country and beyond its borders. I have
personal reports of them in Brazil, Mexico, El Salvador, Senegal
and South Africa. It's an international phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   Polk, a graduate student who is the archivist for the
university's folklore and mythology program, organized the show
with another graduate student, Timothy C. Correll.
</P>
<P>
   The two became interested in muffler men two years ago while
researching storefront decoration in the Los Angeles area. Polk
said: ``I had been aware of these figures but never paid very much
attention to them until the day we came on a spectacular scene
where a dozen figures were lined up out front of a shop by the
owner, Frank Afra, who had made them. We stopped and took a closer
look, and after talking with Afra, we decided that muffler men were
worth further study _ possibly even a show or a book.''
</P>
<P>
   The curators produced both. (The museum catalog costs $59 in
cloth, $29 in paper.). But the history of muffler men they
uncovered is, at best, spotty. The earliest, and tallest, muffler
man they found is an eight-foot giant with bright green legs that
stands at the entrance to the ``Muffler Men'' show.
</P>
<P>
   Made in 1970 by Joe Luria, the owner of a shop in Carson,
Calif., it is called the ``Carson Muffler Robot'' and is based on
one that he had devised in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   Polk and Correll have never found any evidence of muffler men
made before 1970, even photographs. But they have been told that
many existed in the 1950s and '60s, and they are certain that
muffler men have been around for most of this century.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition was being planned while a smaller one _ of 14
figures _ was taking place late last year at Gallery 414 in Fort
Worth, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as there were auto mechanics, there were auto
mechanics making things with reused parts of cars,'' Polk said.
``When they were first produced at the turn of the century,
automobiles were loud, raucous things. The mufflers we have today
were not developed until the 1920s or '30s.''
</P>
<P>
   The form has evolved little since then. But makers represented
in the show vary their figures by the features they paint on the
faces and the things they add: simulated musical instruments,
ersatz vacuum cleaners, robot jetpacks, goggles, clothing and bar
stools.
</P>
<P>
   Space creatures come with silvery wings made from heat shields,
claws of spark plugs and alternator wiring connecting packs on
their backs. A minimalist fantasy figure combines two kinds of
mufflers: a canlike type for the bright yellow torso and a
rod-shaped glass pack muffler for the red sausagelike head, the
work of Manuel Rodriguez and Efran Castillo.
</P>
<P>
   A different approach is seen in ``Recycle, Re-seen.'' A muffler
man, made in 1992 by Jack King of Des Moines, sports a bright red
ribbon for a tie with light-bulb eyes in a hubcap face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Muffler men are a grass roots form of folk art expressing our
car culture,'' said Aarne Anton, a New York dealer in 20th-century
folk art. ``If one person makes muffler men in a garage in a
prominent place, it inspires so many others to come up with their
own special version.''

MARTINEZ GARNERS SECOND CY YOUNG, UNANIMOUSLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was unanimous, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Measuring Pedro Martinez against his peers was only incidentally
about comparing him with the other pitchers in the American League
last season. That's what made Tuesday's announcement that Martinez
was the choice on all 28 ballots for the AL Cy Young Award so
anticlimactic.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone understood that the Red Sox righthander was in a league
of his own last season. The barometer for gauging his performance
was provided not by such contemporaries as Mike Mussina of the
Baltimore Orioles or Aaron Sele of the Texas Rangers, but by a roll
call of the all-time greats, Hall of Famers such as Sandy Koufax
and Steve Carlton, Bob Feller and Bob Gibson, Juan Marichal and
Nolan Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pretty much expected this,'' Martinez conceded Tuesday in a
conference call from the Dominican Republic, where he received
confirmation that he had become just the third pitcher to win the
Cy Young Award in both leagues, joining Gaylord Perry and Randy
Johnson, the Arizona Diamondbacks lefthander who Monday was named
the National League winner.
</P>
<P>
   When Martinez won the NL award for the Montreal Expos in 1997,
he gave the trophy to Marichal, who after his glory years in San
Francisco briefly pitched for the Red Sox and is now sports
minister in the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   This one, Martinez said, he intends to place in his own trophy
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to take it home to my people,'' he said. ``Enjoy it
with my family and friends.''
</P>
<P>
   He may need additional space in that trophy room come Thursday,
when the AL Most Valuable Player will be announced. Martinez would
appear to be a leading candidate, along with countryman Manny
Ramirez, the Cleveland Indians outfielder who knocked in 165 runs.
But as many as eight players have a legitimate shot at the award,
including Texas DH Rafael Palmeiro; Cleveland second baseman Robbie
Alomar; Texas catcher Ivan Rodriguez; New York Yankees shortstop
Derek Jeter and closer Mariano Rivera; and Red Sox shortstop Nomar
Garciaparra, the AL batting champion.
</P>
<P>
   Asked for whom he'd cast his vote, Martinez showed some hometown
favoritism.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to pick, I'd probably pick Nomar,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Martinez also made it clear how much it would mean to him to
win the MVP, something no AL starting pitcher has done since Roger
Clemens was a dual winner (Cy Young, MVP) for the Red Sox in 1986.
Some are biased against voting for a pitcher as MVP, though
Martinez was dismissive of that argument.
</P>
<P>
   If you're going to exclude pitchers from consideration, he said,
then why not exclude other part-timers like designated hitters,
too?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 25 of us on a roster,'' he said. ``We're all
qualified. There shouldn't be any discrimination against anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I win it, fine. If I don't, that's fine, too. There's no
crying in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Try telling that to the hitters rendered helpless on a regular
basis by Martinez last season. His 23 wins were five more than the
three AL pitchers with the next-most: Mussina, Sele, and Bartolo
Colon. Mussina and Colon were second and third in the Cy Young
balloting.
</P>
<P>
   His ERA of 2.07 was 1.37 points lower than the 3.44 of league
runner-up David Cone of the Yankees, and 2.80 lower than the league
average.
</P>
<P>
   There have been just two other occasions _ Dazzy Vance in 1930
and Greg Maddux in 1994 _ when the pitcher with the league's best
ERA was more than a run better than the runner-up.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez struck out 313 batters, 113 more than runner-up Chuck
Finley of the Angels. Opponents batted a league-low .205 against
him, 70 points below the league average. He averaged 13.2
strikeouts per nine innings, more than five more a game than
runner-up Finley, and his 1.6 walks per nine innings were just
behind Gil Heredia of Oakland, 1.5.
</P>
<P>
   He did for pitchers what Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa have done
for sluggers, but given the homer-happy times in which the game is
now played, what he did may have been even more impressive.
</P>
<P>
   He becomes just the fourth AL pitcher to be a unanimous
selection, joining Detroit's Denny McLain (1968), the Yankees' Ron
Guidry (1978), and Clemens (1986 for the Red Sox, 1998 for the Blue
Jays).
</P>
<P>
   How do you improve on a season for the ages?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I'm able to do it again,'' he said. ``I hope to improve
on it. I don't see why not. I'm still young, I'm still healthy, I
expect to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox go into next season with a great deal of uncertainty
in their rotation beyond Martinez. Bret Saberhagen's rotator cuff
surgery may sideline him until at least midseason, lefthander Kent
Mercker elected to become a free agent rather than exercise his
contract option to return, and the Red Sox made Pat Rapp a free
agent rather than exercising the option they held on his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was undaunted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could be good enough,'' he said. ``We did it last year. We
finished in first place in pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Saberhagen is down, we'll have to pick him up. Hopefully
one of the young people will do the job, Brian Rose or Juan Pena.
Ramon (Martinez, his older brother) is coming back healthy,
hopefully. Wakie (Tim Wakefield) we can use any time as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have kids. We need to be healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   His own health, which became an isuue when he strained a back
muscle in the postseason, is fine, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing a lot of swimming,'' he said. ``It feels completely
normal right now.''
</P>
<P>
   There can be no better news for the Sox than that: All is well
in the universe of Cy Martinez.

ANALYSIS: CHINA TRADE ACCORD IS NOT A DONE DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (With CHINA-TRADE-DEAL, CHINA-ASSESS and related stories) 
(bl) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It took three U.S. presidents, two Chinese leaders and dozens of
negotiators 13 years of sometimes dramatic brinkmanship to clear a
path for China to join the World Trade Organization. Now, to listen
to proponents and critics of the measure, the hard work begins.
</P>
<P>
   The trade accord announced Monday is perhaps the most sweeping
agreement of any kind between the United States and China since the
two nations resumed normal diplomatic relations a generation ago.
But unless Congress agrees to forgo the right to review China's
trade status each year, a debate that has become an annual ritual
in Washington, U.S. companies will not enjoy any new trade
advantages, and this week's agreement could become a milestone of
another kind: How politics trumps diplomacy when it comes to China.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that this has been going on long enough that Congress
can separate trade and all the other concerns about China, which we
all have,'' said Rep. Robert Matsui, D-Calif., who has been a
proponent of international agreements on free trade. ``But if
experience is any guide, the Chinese are likely to do something
provocative _ like lobbing missiles off Taiwan _ and that's going
to be a factor in the debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Potential congressional opposition is one reason that China's
accession to the trade body is not a done deal. The European Union,
Canada and several major nations still face negotiating their own
bilateral trade agreements with China. European Union officials had
allowed the United States to take the lead in negotiations, but
Clinton administration officials have been careful to speak only
for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Few expect the European Union or Canada to derail China's bid to
join the global trade body, given that other countries are eager to
take advantage of the broad concessions China has made to reduce
tariffs and allow foreign banks, farmers and telecommunication
companies more access to its huge market. China is expected to try
to complete side agreements with other nations before the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Even if that process goes smoothly and China does become a WTO
member, some U.S. businesses say many of the headline benefits of
the accord will take years, and considerable sweat and tears, to
realize.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that its easier to negotiate and agreement like
this than to make it work in practice,'' said Brad Smith, general
counsel for international affairs at Microsoft, who has long pushed
China to protect copyrights on foreign computer software. ``The
agreement is an important milestone in the sense that it gives us a
solid foundation, but now we have to get busy doing the hard
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   And all this assumes that China's leadership, which has faced
domestic pressure to protect Chinese industry and jobs, will remain
firmly behind the agreement. The accord Monday was seen as giving a
boost to Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, a plain-spoken reformer, but
Chinese politics are notoriously hard to read, and few dismiss the
possibility of a political backlash against trade concessions
there.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the trade agreement still give it good odds of
winning congressional backing and, longer term, being fully carried
out. Bolstering their case is an outpouring of support from
American businesses, which have promised the strongest lobbying
campaign on a trade issue since Congress approved the North
American Free Trade Agreement in 1994. Administration officials
also promised an intensive effort to push the agreement through the
remaining hurdles.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers set the tone Tuesday by
promising to mount a vigorous defense of the benefit of trade and
globalization for average Americans. ``This means more jobs for
Americans,'' he said. ``It means larger export markets for American
producers to provide high-wage jobs. It means a more stable,
competitive, global economy. It means better opportunities for
American consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   But labor union leaders were equally vigorous Tuesday in their
vows to block approval in Congress, with some predicting that they
could stop this deal the way they have blocked other administration
trade initiatives. Teamsters president James P. Hoffa denounced the
pact as a ``slap in the face not only to workers in America, but to
their counterparts in China.''
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders predicted that they could block approval of the
deal by mustering an unusual coalition Democrats, labor-friendly
Republican moderates and some conservative Republicans angry about
human rights violations in China.
</P>
<P>
   Congress will likely take up the issue in February, shortly
after the beginning of the new session. Though proponents of the
measure would prefer to keep the debate focused on the merits of
increasingly trade with China and broadening access to its market,
a battle they think they can win, China's critics will surely seek
to make the debate as wide-ranging as possible. Critics say China
spies on the United States, ships sensitive weapons to troubled
regions, often breaks its word after sealing international treaties
and suppresses all kinds of political and religious opposition at
home.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who has opposed granting China
low-tariff treatment in the United States in the past, said the
broad aspects of the China relationship weighed on President
Clinton's decision to seal a trade deal now, and will weigh on
Congress when it considers whether to give up its right to review
China's trade status each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is inevitable that we will consider the full range of
issues about China because it goes to China's credibility _ whether
they can honor a deal,'' said Ms. Pelosi.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the uncertainty in Washington is that past turning
points in the bilateral relations, like state visits and the annual
trade review, have prompted an outpouring of damaging revelations
about China's international behavior, including allegations about
its theft of U.S. nuclear secrets and infiltration into the 1996
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the pattern,'' said Huang Yasheng, a China expert at
the Harvard Business School. ``As soon Congress starts
deliberating, you can bet that some kind of bad news will leak
out.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Huang said he suspects that China's willingness to
grant broad concessions on trade was motivated, in part, by its
desire to deny critics in the United States a annual forum to
attack China and keep relations in a deep freeze. But to achieve
that goal, China will have to endure at least one more round of
intense attacks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Matsui said supporters of the China agreement will likely
prevail, though previous votes on extending China's trade status
suggest the tally could be close. ``Probably the most likely reason
this will go through is that if we don't give China permanent trade
status, all other countries will get tariff reductions and we
won't,'' Matsui said, drawing a scenario in which China enters the
WTO but Congress doesn't approve the terms that the United States
negotiated to make accession possible.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the trade deal clears the congressional hurdle, U.S.
business could face years of hard bargaining, court fights and
diplomatic lobbying before that get the advantages it promises.

 &HT;    Rumors of plant's closure have politicians trying to work dealBy
Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rumors that Lockheed Martin Corp. is considering
shutting down its Marietta, Ga., plant are fueling political
support for a plan that would give the defense contractor $150
million to keep its cargo plane line open.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Georgia's congressional delegation strongly support
the plan, saying it would stabilize the C-130J cargo plane until
2002 when the Air Force plans to start buying at least 150 of the
$50 million planes.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's lawmakers say the plan defies the speculation that
Lockheed Martin has placed its Marietta plant on the chopping
block. If Lockheed were seriously considering selling or closing
the plant, they ask, would the company have worked out such a
long-term plan with the Air Force?
</P>
<P>
   The plan essentially gives Lockheed Martin a down payment on
future orders in an effort to keep the company from eliminating the
assembly line because of a lack of orders, Sen. Paul Coverdell
(R-Ga.) said.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force has estimated it would cost some $680 million to
reopen the Marietta facility if Lockheed shuts down its cargo plane
line. In addition, the price of the plane would increase to as much
as $70 million, according to congressional documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is putting a downpayment down to make sure that this
center of intelligence and capacity is there to build the plane
that the Air Force wants,'' Coverdell said. ``If you jeopardize the
line, you jeopardize the aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan, called an Economic Order Quantity, is similar to the
way the federal government pays farmers not to harvest certain
crops. The difference is that this proposal would allow Lockheed to
begin work on at least two of the aircraft that the Air Force
intends to purchase starting in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The plan to give Lockheed money to keep the line ``warm'' came
after a meeting between Coverdell and Air Force Secretary Whitten
Peters in July.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of that meeting, Peters sent a team to Marietta to
assess how many planes the company needed in its production cycle
to keep the C-130 line open.
</P>
<P>
   Peters presented Coverdell and other members of the Georgia
delegation with the proposal in August. Coverdell said he told
Peters that he wasn't interested in the Air Force buying planes
that it didn't want. ``I also told him I'm not interested in having
the Air Force shoot itself in the foot by not buying the planes
now,'' Coverdell said.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is now under consideration at the Air Force, which is
drafting its spending plan for 2001. Coverdell and other members of
the delegation have met with Defense Secretary William Cohen in an
effort to make sure the plan is in the Defense Department's budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is certainly not a handout,'' said Jim Grant, Lockheed's
director of government acquirement. ``The $150 million in fact puts
us to work. It gives us the opportunity to build planes a little
earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Max Cleland (D-Ga.) strongly supports the plan, but he is
taking no chances.
</P>
<P>
   Cleland and Sen. Tim Hutchinson (R-Ark. ), a fellow member of
the Senate Armed Services Committee, are creating a bipartisan
commission of lawmakers in the Senate and the House who want to
ensure the future of the C-130J program.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force has assigned a liaison to the commission, as have
the Air Guard and Air Force Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   The fleet of some 600 C-130Js is aging; some aircraft are 40
years old. The demand for the aircraft is high, Cleland said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you chopped Marietta, you'd have to recreate it and that
would be next to impossible,'' said Cleland, noting that the plane
is almost entirely produced at the Marietta plant where some
families have two generations working.
</P>
<P>
   ``This aircraft cuts across the depth and breadth of our
nation's armed forces,'' Cleland said.
</P>
<P>
   If the plan is not included in the Defense Department's proposed
budget, Cleland said he would continue to try to sell the aircraft
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators are working on a deal to sell as many as six
aircraft to the Kuwait government, but it is not signed. The
Italian government has also expressed an interest in four planes.
</P>
<P>
   Not to move forward with the plan would be a major mistake, said
Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.), whose district includes the Marietta plant
with its 8,000 workers. Barr said it made no sense to allow the
cargo plane line to be ``mothballed'' when there will be a high
demand for the plane in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a phenomenal waste of money to allow the line to
be shut down only to be restarted in a few years,'' Barr said. He
has sent Cohen a series of letters urging approval of the plan in
next year's budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe that the rumors of the demise of the C-130J line
and Lockheed Martin's plant in Marietta are greatly exaggerated,''
Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the House Armed Services have also given the plan a
nod. Rep. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), a committee member, said the
plan is not the same as giving a farmer a subsidy to let a field go
fallow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lockheed will not be paid to delay production of aircraft,''
he said. Rather, the plan would allow Lockheed's contractors and
subcontractors to continue operations and deliver airplanes to the
military sooner, he said.

 &HT;    1918 Spanish flu virus may now be studied
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving to (a) General news and (l) Lifestyle categories.)

<P>
   Six bodies unearthed last year in the Norwegian Arctic have
unexpectedly yielded a scientific prize: They hold part of the
virus that caused the Spanish influenza of 1918, which killed at
least 40 million people in one of the worst disease outbreaks in
history.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at a scientific meeting in London said Tuesday that
they have identified fragments of the long-sought virus in the
brains and organs of six young men who died in October 1918 on
Svalbard, an island less than 800 miles from the North Pole.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies were unearthed in August 1998 by a multinational
research team who had traveled to the Arctic in hopes of finding
frozen corpses in which the flu virus had been preserved. But the
bodies were found thawed and decayed, and scientific gossip over
the past year had dismissed them as worthless to research.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out the gossip was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tissue samples that people had dismissed as so bad are
yielding very good results,'' a jubilant Kirsty Duncan, the team's
leader, said in a phone interview from London. ``We have fragments
of the flu's genetic material, the RNA, from the lung, the kidney,
the liver and the brain.''
</P>
<P>
   Science has never been able to understand the 1918 flu. The
disease attacked, circled the globe and died out within a year.
While it flourished, it was horrific: It killed quickly, with high
fevers and severe inflammation of the lung that caused victims to
drown in their own body fluids.
</P>
<P>
   It has never returned _ but because flu is a constantly mutating
virus, researchers have feared that a similar flu could recur. And
since the 1918 flu vanished decades before science gained the
ability to analyze viruses in the laboratory, there is no data that
would help researchers recognize an equally lethal virus.
</P>
<P>
   The need to understand the 1918 flu has recently become acute.
Worldwide epidemics of flu, called pandemics, occur in roughly
30-year cycles, and the last confirmed one was in 1968. The
re-emergence of a killer flu could be a global catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to understand why the 1918 virus was so
lethal,'' said Dr. Nancy Cox, chief of the influenza branch at the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, which is
charged with pandemic planning. ``We want to know why it was able
to kill so many people, and we want to know whether there are
particular anti-virals we could prepare in case a similar strain
should emerge.''
</P>
<P>
   Parallel efforts to recover the 1918 flu have already yielded
results. A Washington research team led by Dr. Jeffery Taubenberger
has isolated significant amounts of the flu genome from samples of
bodies found in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Taubenberger's work is based on lung tissues salvaged from
autopsy samples in a military archive and from a partially frozen
corpse found two years ago in Alaska. If the results disclosed in
London Tuesday are confirmed, they could be an important complement
to that research.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most interesting thing about the reports that I have heard
_ if they are confirmed _ is that they indicate the 1918 virus may
have been able to replicate in tissue other than in the respiratory
tract,'' Cox said. ``This may be a clue as to why the virus was so
lethal, because usually it replicates in the respiratory tract, and
is not found in the kidney, spleen and brain.''
</P>
<P>
   Initial analyses presented at the London virology gathering
suggest that the virus, which is believed to have appeared first in
the United States, had mutated by the time it reached Norway. Dr.
Rod Daniels, a virologist who analyzed the Arctic samples, said
Tuesday that viral fragments he found ``are slightly different, but
are definitely related'' to those found by Taubenberger.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels recovered the viral fragments from 92 samples of bone,
brain and organ that were taken from the Norway bodies and flown to
the National Institute for Medical Research in London, the closest
lab outfitted with high levels of protection against accidental
release of disease organisms.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement reached by the multinational team _ led by
Duncan, a Canadian, and including scientists from the U.S., United
Kingdom and Norway _ the samples were to be examined first in
London and then shared with labs in the other team-members'
countries.
</P>
<P>
   That distribution has not yet taken place, and in the past few
days charges of miscommunication and scientific misconduct have
swirled around the 7-year-long effort. Duncan, who teaches
geography at two Canadian universities, flew to London at the last
minute after leaks in the British press suggested another team
member, Dr. John Oxford, was being given credit for the
discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get credit for my team-members and for Norway,''
she said. ``The community where these bodies were buried gave
something precious to us, and we have not yet given them anything
in return.''

GORE REACHES OUT TO ENVIRONMENTALISTS WITH NEW TRADE REQUIREMENT 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Seeking to win the active support of environmental
groups that have so far failed to muster much enthusiasm for his
presidential campaign, Vice President Al Gore announced Tuesday
that President Clinton was signing an executive order requiring
that environmental reviews be part of all new trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``America can and should use its trade policy to strengthen
environmental protection both at home and abroad,'' Gore said in
front of cameras at the airport here before returning to
Washington, D.C. ``This is really a significant, watershed event
for the relationship between trade and the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The order will require the U.S. trade representative to conduct
full scale environmental reviews early in all major trade
negotiations, Gore said, ``so that we can use that information to
shape emerging trade agreements and to better protect our own
environment and the global environment.''
</P>
<P>
   But the executive order does not apply to the environment in the
countries with which the United States enters into trade
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the order begins to put environmental concerns on a par
with business concerns in international agreements, a step that
environmental groups hailed Tuesday as significant, if only a start
in the long-time struggle between businesses and environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   It comes at a crucial time, as the world's trade ministers
prepare to meet in Seattle at the end of the month to discuss
international trade rules, and it sends a signal that the United
States considers environmental standards important.
</P>
<P>
   It also comes at a crucial time for Gore in his campaign for the
Democratic presidential nomination. He has failed so far to stir
the passions of the environmental community on his behalf. The
administration's decision to let Gore make Tuesday's announcement
was a reflection both of his need to make some headway with this
important constituency and also of his push to make the
administration more sensitive to environmental concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the vice president's hand behind this,'' said Daniel
Seligman, director of the Sierra Club's trade program. ``It
distinguishes him from the rest of the pack.''
</P>
<P>
   Seligman described former Sen. Bill Bradley, Gore's rival for
the nomination and someone who has received strong marks from
environmentalists on other matters, as ``missing in action'' on
this subject.
</P>
<P>
   Annie Petsonk, international counsel for the Environmental
Defense Fund, welcomed the action as a good first step in bringing
the environmental impact of trade agreements before the public. She
said the executive order essentially codified the routine practice
during the Bush administration of making such assessments and that
the order now puts the burden on any future president to undo it.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's announcement Tuesday followed an hour-long closed-door
session with about a dozen environmental leaders here Monday night.
They have expressed concerns about the administration's commitment
to an array of environmental issues, from protection of salmon in
the Pacific Northwest to the permanent placement of a tug boat in
waters here to try to steer oil barges clear of hazards that could
result in spills.
</P>
<P>
   Participants in the meeting described Gore's posture as
unusually pleading. He told his listeners that he and Clinton could
not have won in 1992 without their support and that while they may
have been disappointed with some administration actions, he needed
their active involvement now.
</P>
<P>
   Participants also said Gore distanced himself from some of
Clinton's environmental actions. For example, when asked about a
strip-mining provision that is being sought by Sen. Robert Byrd,
D-W.Va., but is opposed by environmentalists, Gore said he had been
``on the road'' and was not up on the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   He also told them that environmental reviews would be a central
topic at the World Trade Organization talks here later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Seligman of the Sierra Club said the spirit of Gore's remarks
was encouraging. ``The core concern of environmentalists on trade
agreements has been the way trade rules restrict countries like us
from enforcing environmental standards,'' he said. ``We're not
trying to inject environmental standards into WTO; we want to
prevent WTO from weakening the standards we already have.''

 &HT;    Waddell patient despite losses
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Even scouting prospects in Slovakia and Finland, Don
Waddell never was far from his hockey team last week.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone provided direct updates from his wife, his coach
or team counsel. It also provided a hookup to the Internet for
long-distance broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I listened to two games on Real Audio,'' the Thrashers'
general manager said. ``I was up until 4:30 in the morning both
nights.''
</P>
<P>
   Waddell is home now, but not quite on a rescue mission. Although
the Thrashers return home for tonight's game against Tampa Bay
after getting swept on a four-game road trip, Waddell is not
preparing to drop the roster in the office shredder.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where your patience is tried,'' he said. ``You have to
be careful and not let your emotions get carried away with this.
The last few nights, don't you think I've been tossing and turning,
wondering, `OK, how can we get better? Is calling up (Andreas)
Karlsson going to make us better?' But if we won in Montreal, we'd
be sitting here thinking, `We're going in the right direction.' You
can't let a few losses dictate what you're going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Waddell said he has no plans now either to swing a trade or call
up a prospect from Orlando (IHL) in an attempt to help a team that
scored six goals during the road trip.
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers' last victory came against the Lightning two weeks
ago. But they followed that with losses to Boston 4-2, Florida 4-1,
New Jersey 5-1 and Montreal 4-2. However, the game against the
Devils was the only one the Thrashers never were in, which helped
persuade Waddell to hold off on any moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were losing every game 5-1, 6-1, I'd just say, `We're
not good enough,' '' Waddell said. ``But there's been games we
could've won, so you're hoping the players are using this as a
learning experience. You're hoping you don't go through games 60
through 70 like you did these last four.''
</P>
<P>
   Karlsson, a 6-foot-3 center with five goals and four assists
with Orlando, probably will be the next call-up from Orlando. Dean
Sylvester, a 6-2 winger with four goals, and defenseman Brett Clark
also could be summoned.
</P>
<P>
   The league has no shortage of trade speculation, particularly
with high-profile forwards Alexei Yashin and Keith Primeau still
out of camp and New Jersey's Brendan Morrison reportedly having
asked to be traded. But the Thrashers don't have the veteran
resources to make a deal and probably aren't going to part with any
of their younger players, prospects or draft picks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day my phone rings, and every day I'm on the phone,''
Waddell said. ``That's my job. If something makes sense, I have to
do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there anything out there right now that makes sense? Not a
thing. . . . You don't make change for the sake of making change.
You make a change if it's going to help your hockey club. You don't
make a change to shake things up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers will play four of their next five games at home,
which Waddell hopes will be positive. The team has recorded six
points (2-2-1 with one regulation tie) in its past five home games.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I'm banking on,'' he said. ``We have a homestand,
and we need to win some games. You stay focused, you stay positive,
and you tell yourself you're still moving forward. It's not a
situation like, `We have to win tonight to make the playoffs.' ''

ANALYSIS: CHINA'S CONTRADICTORY IMPULSES 
</HEADLINE>
  (With CHINA-TRADE and related stories) 
(mk) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ On Monday, President Jiang Zemin warmly played host to
American officials at his residence to celebrate a major trade
agreement that commits China to far-reaching economic reforms and
broad international ties.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, on the other side of Chang An Avenue, Jiang's
security police forcibly detained more than a dozen members of the
banned Falun Gong spiritual movement who had dared to unfurl a
yellow banner and meditate in Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   The two events, only 24 hours apart, illustrated the
contradictory impulses now driving China, a country that one moment
seems to be hurtling toward a more open future and the next seems
mired in narrow communist orthodoxy and intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, one day after the announcement of a trade deal that
is likely to lead to membership in the World Trade Organization,
China's state-controlled news media uniformly gushed over the
deal's benefits for business as well as foreign relations. The pact
will ``improve relations with other major powers, particularly the
U.S.,'' said the Beijing Youth Daily, a newspaper that just four
months ago was castigating the United States as an imperialist
invader for its bombing campaign in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of paradoxes in China now that are difficult
to resolve,'' said Minxin Pei, a senior associate at the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts in and outside China, as well as President Clinton,
have predicted that the opening of the economy required for entry
into the WTO would ultimately push China to liberalize in
non-economic spheres as well _ promoting, for example, more freedom
of the press and the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, the contradictory facets of China remain mostly
uncoupled, creating the odd juxtapositions of the past 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economic dimension of China has been transformed to allow
for market forces and private property,'' said He Qinglian, a noted
author and economist from Shenzhen. ``But the other dimensions _
politics and ideology _ have changed very little. The political
system has changed only as much as demanded by economic change. And
in ideology, there's been very little change at all.''
</P>
<P>
   This is partly because China's leaders are much more unified on
the need for economic reform than for political reform, said Pei of
the Carnegie Endowment. And Chinese citizens are, for the moment,
far more concerned with improving their living standards than with
voting, he added.
</P>
<P>
   But other experts point out that there is a unifying impulse
behind the leaders' seemingly contradictory actions: to maintain
the power of the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The furthering of reform and opening characterized by the WTO
deal and the intensified crackdown on the sect and dissidents are
both fully in line with Deng Xiaoping theory, which calls for `both
hands being aggressive,''' said a researcher at the Institute of
Marxism, Leninism and Mao Tse-tung Theory of the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   He said the leaders hoped that the trade deal would bring
foreign investment to maintain high economic growth, which would in
turn promote stability. ``If they can achieve these goals, it can
help consolidate the rule of the Communist Party, which _ remember
_ is the most important of Deng's four cardinal principles.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, the Chinese government has grown increasingly
at home living in this divided world, making little effort to link
liberalizing economic and social policies with politics at home.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 and '98, in the months preceding the exchange of state
visits by Jiang and Clinton, the Chinese routinely released
dissidents as a goodwill gesture, held only a few political trials
and even tolerated the development of an embryonic democratic
party.
</P>
<P>
   But this fall, even as Jiang toured Europe and chatted on the
phone with Clinton in pursuit of a trade agreement, Chinese courts
were sentencing pro-democracy activists to long prison terms after
brief trials without lawyers. And the Chinese police were detaining
thousands of Falun Gong members for practicing the form of exercise
and meditation that the government had banned.
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong is an idiosyncratic blend of traditional Chinese
exercises and Buddhist and Taoist religious beliefs that was widely
popular _ before it was banned in July _ among middle-aged Chinese
for its supposed health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, the government has been conducting an old-style
Maoist propaganda campaign to wipe out what it has labeled an
``evil sect,'' complete with re-education for members and detention
or labor camps for those who have publicly continued its practices.
</P>
<P>
   But in a China now filled with Internet cafes and Hong Kong
cable television, campaigns do not work as they used to, and this
one has fallen flat both among more devoted practitioners and among
the many Chinese who see the group as mostly harmless.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Tuesday, on a crisp fall morning in Tiananmen Square, a dozen
or so practitioners unfurled a banner reading ``The Great Law of
Falun'' and held out their hands to begin their exercises, a small
protest to attract the attention of the U.N. secretary-general,
Kofi Annan, who is visiting Beijing this week.
</P>
<P>
   Police in uniforms and plain clothes _ on bicycles, in vans and
on foot _ were out in large numbers and the protesters were kicked
and then shoved into vans, which sped out of the square, witnesses
said, apparently lightly injuring a bystander.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say it is unclear how long China's leaders can
aggressively open their economy to the outside world while pursuing
a totally closed political system at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the whole process of economic pluralism inevitably
leads to pluralism in ideology and other spheres, because it leads
to diversity of economic interests which in turn produces
distinctive needs and values,'' said Ms. He, the author and
economist.
</P>
<P>
   She said that at a time when China is changing so rapidly, the
country's sustaining value systems, Confucianism and communism, are
both collapsing _ leading to the rise of groups like Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
   ``China still adheres to a monolithic ideology,'' she said.
``But a specialized professional society like China is becoming
requires a more innovative, pluralistic ideology.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, as China's stock prices, after an initial surge in
response to the trade agreement, tapered off Tuesday, investors and
economists in China seemed uncertain that opening the economy
would, by itself, lead to the economic growth that the Communist
Party wants and needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kind of paradoxes we see today can last for some time,''
said Pei of the Carnegie Endowment. ``But no society can tolerate
that kind of dissonance forever.''

CHINA DENIES BUYING ADVANCED RADAR SYSTEM FROM ISRAEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS. NOTE: This story was filed as PM-CHINA-ARMS-NYT at 3 p.m.

<P>
   BEIJING _ A government spokesman denied on Tuesday that China's
military had bought an advanced airborne radar system from Israel,
even though Israeli officials have privately acknowledged to the
United States that the sale took place.
</P>
<P>
   At a regular press briefing on Tuesday, Sun Yuxi, a Foreign
Ministry spokesman, was asked about recent published reports that
Israel is installing the $250 million radar system on a Russian
aircraft, for delivery to China.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think what you just mentioned exists,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no defense cooperation between China and Israel,''
Sun said. American military officials say that Israel has secretly
sold China billions of dollars worth of weapons over recent years,
in part to help sustain its domestic military industry.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials have urged Israel not to sell more
radar-equipped planes to China. The early-warning radar system,
said to be comparable to the American AWACS system, would bolster
China's abilities in a battle with Taiwan, or with American forces
seeking to defend Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   China is rushing to modernize its outdated air and naval forces,
which now have little capacity to fight a prolonged battle far from
shore.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis did not deny the sale, but said that no
American-supplied technology was involved in the radar system so
there was no violation of U.S. export controls, Pentagon officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Defense Department officials and press reports from
Israel, workers at Elta, a subsidiary of Israel Aircraft
Industries, have mounted the Israeli radar complex, known as the
Phalcon, on a Russian-made cargo plane for future delivery to
China. American officials say China has asked to buy at least four
more of the radar systems, also for installation on Russian-built
planes.

&HT;        TEXAS REPS. APPLAUD OPENING CHINA MARKET TO FARMERS
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Alex Canizares  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Nov. 16 -- Texas congressmen gave a collective nod
to a U.S.-China trade deal that chops in half duties placed on farm
products that Texas has had trouble exporting.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which all but ensures China's membership in the
World Trade Organization, cuts tariffs on cotton, rice, wheat and
corn products, and permits trade between private companies for the
first time ever.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas representatives who oversee agriculture policy in the
House, Agriculture Committee Chairman Larry Combest, R-Amarillo,
and Ranking Member Charles Stenholm, D-Stamford, cautiously
supported the deal, saying it appears at first glance to be
favorable to U.S. farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agreement is an important step towards an improved
trading relationship with China,'' Stenholm said in a press release
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, signed Monday by U.S. and Chinese trade
officials, China will reduce tariffs from an overall average of
22.1 percent down to 17 percent, and slash even more from
agricultural duties -- from 31.5 to 14.5 percent on average by
2004. U.S. exporters of wheat, corn, rice and cotton would enjoy
greater access to China. China promised to eliminate export
subsidies, opening the market for U.S. cotton and rice producers.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, the agreement all but secures China's entry into the
World Trade Organization, the international trade policing body,
opening up international markets to China's textile and electronics
industries.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Pringle, a lobbyist for the Texas Farm Bureau, said
</P>
<P>
   the China deal is good news for Texas rice farmers. Texas makes
a long-grain rice that the Chinese would buy, he said, even though
that country already produces large amounts of rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``[With] the reduction in tariffs for corn and wheat and feed
grains such as rice, it's going to be a big plus for Texas,''
Pringle said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the U.S. sold $1.3 billion in agricultural goods to
China, including cow hides, grains and feeds, according to the
Agriculture Department.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. exported $118 million of cotton to China last year, out
of $2.5 billion in total world cotton exports.
</P>
<P>
   Texas exports much less in food goods to China than to Mexico
and Latin America, both due to the high tariffs, as well as the
distance.
</P>
<P>
   Texas exported $42.7 million in crop and livestock commodities
to China last year, and $32.1 million for processed foods. By
contrast, Texas sold $1.1 billion in crop and livestock to Mexico,
the state's largest trading partner, and $1 billion in processed
foods.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some room for growth there,'' said Beverly Boyd,
spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Agriculture. ``As the
leading cattle and cotton state in the nation, anything that
provides markets is definitely going to help Texas agriculture.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress will vote on whether to grant China permanent ``normal
trade relations'' status next year. Without permanent NTR status,
China's application to join the WTO next year would not open up
Chinese markets to U.S. businesses.
</P>
<P>
   As Washington's relations with China consistently have remained
tense over human rights and campaign finance issues, Farm Bureau
Lobbyist Steve Pringle foresees a battle among the Texas delegation
over the NTR vote.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran free-trader Rep. Bill Archer, R-Houston, who chairs the
Ways and Means committee that will vote on China's ``normal trade
relations'' status, said the administration did a ``good job'' of
securing the trade deal.
</P>
<P>
   Archer will vote to give China NTR status, which would benefit
South Texas, said Archer's spokesman Sean Rushton. ``Houston is, in
terms of tonnage per year, the biggest U.S. port; from that
perspective trade can help,'' Rushton said.

 &HT;    Bowden hopes history won't be repeated
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ The sequence of events from two years ago is
sharp in the 70-year-old mind of Bobby Bowden. The thrill of
success fades with time, the Florida State football coach said.
Heartache, however, remains clear forever.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden has had a lot of success. On Oct. 23, he became the fifth
Division I-A coach in history to win 300 games. In his 33 years as
a head coach, he has lost 85 games. None of them, Bowden said
Tuesday, caused him more pain than the 32-29 loss to Florida in
Gainesville in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took Daddy a long time to get over that one,'' said son
Terry, the former Auburn coach who now is an analyst for ABC. ``In
some ways, I still don't think he's gotten over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida State was 10-0 and ranked No. 1 that day. The loss
knocked the Seminoles out of a date with Nebraska in the Orange
Bowl, where they would have played for at least a share of the
national championship. Losing such an opportunity was bad enough.
Losing it to the Gators was unbearable.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 game was on the minds of Bowden and his Florida State
players as the No. 1 Seminoles prepared to play at No. 3 Florida on
Saturday. As was the case in 1997, a win puts Florida State into a
game _ the Sugar Bowl _ that will decide the national championship.
But also as in 1997, a loss would be a bitter failure and render
the season a failure by Florida State standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is that I cried after the 1997 game,'' defensive
tackle Jerry Johnson said. ``I don't want to do that again.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Florida State appeared to be in pretty good shape
late in the game. It had the ball and the lead, 26-25, with 4:58 to
play. Grind it out, Bowden told offensive coordinator Mark Richt.
We don't want to give the ball back to these guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the plan,'' Richt said. ``We did not want their
offense to touch the ball again.''
</P>
<P>
   When Travis Minor burst off left tackle for 36 yards to the
Florida 6-yard line, the Seminoles were poised to put the game
away.
</P>
<P>
   But three plays later, Florida State was on the Florida 3-yard
line. Bowden decided to kick the field goal to give his team a
four-point lead, 29-25, with 2:38 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping to score a touchdown and put the thing away,''
Bowden said. ``But we had to kick the field goal to get a
four-point lead. Now they have to move the ball 80 yards in just a
little time.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida took over on its 20. On the first play from scrimmage,
Gator quarterback Doug Johnson and wide receiver Jacquez Green
pulled a trick they had worked out on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson went to the line of scrimmage and gave a hand signal to
Green, indicating a short curl route about 10 yards over the
middle. Knowing that the Florida State secondary probably knew
their signals by then, the two had agreed that when Green saw the
sign, he would change his route and go long.
</P>
<P>
   It worked. Cornerback Samari Rolle rushed up to cover the short
route, and Green blew past him and hauled in a pass that covered 63
yards, to the Florida State 17-yard line. Two plays later Fred
Taylor scored to put Florida ahead 32-29 with 1:46 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of plays that caused us to lose that game,
but that's the one people remember,'' defensive coordinator Mickey
Andrews said. ``I sure know I remembered it.''
</P>
<P>
   Three plays later, FSU quarterback Thad Busby was intercepted
and the game was over.
</P>
<P>
   So, as Florida State enters Florida's Swamp on Saturday, the
Seminoles are determined that such painful history will not be
repeated. Nobody should have to go through that twice in a
lifetime, Bowden said. Not even a 70-year-old coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a long time after that game before I was right with the
world,'' Bowden said. ``I do not want to go through that again.''
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA STATE AT FLORIDA
</P>
<P>
   _ When, where: 3:30 p.m. Saturday, Florida Field, Gainesville,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   _ TV: CBS.
</P>
<P>
   _ Series: Florida leads 26-15-2.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: Florida State won 23-12.
</P>
<P>
   _ Records, rankings: Florida State 10-0, No. 1; Florida 9-1, No.
3.
</P>
<P>
   _ At stake: If Florida State wins, it will play in the national
championship game in the Sugar Bowl. If Florida wins, and also wins
the SEC championship game on Dec. 4, it has a good chance to reach
the Sugar Bowl.

BISHOPS URGED TO DELAY VOTE ON CATHOLIC COLLEGE CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- As the nation's Catholic bishops sequestered
themselves to debate a proposal that would tighten church control
over Catholic colleges, educators and theologians urged Tuesday
them to put off a vote on the issue, saying there are still too
many unresolved concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The bishop's vote, expected Wednesday, caps a year of debate on
a document drafted by a relatively conservative group of bishops
that attempts to strengthen the Catholic identity of colleges.
Known as Ex Corde Ecclesiae, the document would require colleges to
make sure a majority of their faculty and trustees be ``faithful''
Catholics, ask the presidents of institutions to take an oath of
fidelity, and require theology professors to have a mandate from
the local bishop saying they were teaching an approved version of
Catholic doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   The bishops are facing pressure from the Vatican, which first
asked for the document nearly 10 years ago, and rejected as too
weak the version the bishops overwhelmingly approved in 1996. But
many Catholic colleges insist that the current version of Ex Corde,
written more along Vatican lines, will end up hurting the church
and the colleges by launching them into divisive debates on how to
define ``faithful,'' what to do with professors who refuse to seek
a mandate, and how much sway bishops would have over day to day
decisions like what speakers or student groups to allow on campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in the academy are afraid the bishops will vote hastily
when there are still a number of unresolved issues,'' said Father
Thomas Rausch, head of the theology department at Loyola Marymount
University in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was to come this morning, and approval requires
two-thirds of the bishops here, which Tuesday totaled 283. The
bishops can vote to approve the document, or they can simply vote
to table it, sending it back for more consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents took as a sign of hope that the bishops had requested
a secret ballot, as opposed the more usual voice vote or show of
hands. This way, they said, the bishops could vote their true
feelings without fear of recrimination from the 10 cardinals, most
of whom have been vigorous supporters of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the conference of bishops went into private session for
the afternoon, in which they were expected to spend much of their
time debating Ex Corde. Outside the vote, observers predicted that
the 10 cardinals would try to assess the document's chances of
success based on the discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the leadership thinks it won't get two-thirds, rather than
embarrass themselves and the Vatican, they'll just send it back for
more study,'' said Father Thomas J. Reese, editor of America, the
Jesuit magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Ex Corde Ecclesiae came out of the concern that Catholic
universities would go the way of their Protestant cousins: as
places like Boston College, Notre Dame, and Georgetown became more
national universities, they would also become more secular. The
Vatican first approved it in 1990, and it was to be adapted, or
``normed'' to each region of the world within a few years. But no
other region has approved it, and the US region, as the largest, is
expected to set the standard. The US conference of bishops approved
a set of norms in 1996 by a vote of 226-4. But the Vatican sent
back that version, asking for a legal interpretation. A revised
version that came out of the bishops meeting here a year ago
prompted wide complaint from colleges.
</P>
<P>
   The opponents support defending their institutions against
creeping secularism. But what's at stake, they say, are principles
key to the tradition of higher education in this country: academic
freedom and institutional autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the concerns were addressed in yet another revision that
came out in the early summer. But that version, Rausch said, simply
put the worrisome passages into the footnotes.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the difficulty of the vote, though, is that no one among
the bishops or colleges seems to know exactly how the document
would play out. Much, supporters and opponents agree, depends on
particular relationships between college presidents and bishops.
</P>
<P>
   Still, supporters say, Ex Corde is a necessary step to
protecting the colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't preserve, as Catholics, the gift the church has
given to the world through our universities, then who will,
Harvard?'' said Manuel Miranda, head of the Cardinal Newman
society, which has been one of the strongest supporters of the
version of Ex Corde approved last year. ``The universities, left to
themselves, are not doing it.''

OH, FOR THE GOOD OLD DAYS OF 1998
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a time when the USC-UCLA game would inspire the
passions of the local citizenry.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when the USC-UCLA game would decide the Pac-10
representative for the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when the USC-UCLA game was shown on national
television and actually was awaited with breathless anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, for the good old days when the schools believe it or not
actually fielded winning football teams that routinely were in the
Top10 rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Why, I can remember way back to 1998 when the Bruins came into
the game undefeated and needing a victory to preserve a shot at the
national championship.
</P>
<P>
   They got it, of course my memory isn't quite good enough any
longer to recall the last time the Bruins actually suffered the
indignity of losing to USC but, alas, that would be the last
important victory in the UCLA program.
</P>
<P>
   Well, anyway, for better or for worse, they're going to stage
this country's most renowned college football city rivalry again
this Saturday when the Trojans and Bruins stumble into each other
at the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   As you might have heard, USC and UCLA are the latest to become
ensnared in the Great L.A. Sports Curse of the 1990s that has
featured such ugly phenomena as the Raiders and Rams bolting the
area, the Dodgers deteriorating into a low-rated Fox comedy show,
the Lakers making it a sacred spring custom of getting swept in the
NBA playoffs, the Clippers being, well, the Clippers, the Angels
getting everyone fired, etc., etc., etc.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are all sorts of riveting questions surrounding
Saturday's pillow match between the Bruins and Trojans even though
both teams enter it with 4-6 records and both have inspired
dizzying levels of indifference among their loyalists this bitterly
disappointing season:
</P>
<P>
   Will R. Jay Soward, the Trojans' notoriously brash receiver,
make a Joe Namath-like victory guarantee for his team, which,
considering that the Trojans have lost eight straight times to the
Bruins, might not be such a brash proclamation?
</P>
<P>
   Will the Trojans' goofy second-year coach, Paul (Can't) Hackett,
finally put the finger of blame on himself rather than on his
players and coaches as he's done in the past if the six-point
favorite Trojans are upset?
</P>
<P>
   How will the Bruins' coach, Bob Toledo, explain to disgruntled
alums his reasons for keeping quarterback Ryan McCann hidden all
season if McCann is able to continue the magic against USC that he
displayed against Washington?
</P>
<P>
   If the Trojans are playing horribly and losing at halftime not
exactly out of the realm of possibility will their voluble
athletics director, Mike Garrett, storm into the dressing room and
give his best Rockne impersonation, as he's been known to do in the
past?
</P>
<P>
   Will Paul (Can't) Hackett wear his sunglasses even if it's an
overcast day, as he did in South Bend during the Trojans' glorious
loss to Notre Dame?
</P>
<P>
   Will the retired broadcaster, Keith Jackson, who actually came
out of retirement this fall to work again for ABC until he decided
to re-retire this week in lieu of working the USC-UCLA game, watch
the proceedings on television, or will he participate in a lawn
bowling tournament?
</P>
<P>
   Will Soward and Kareem Kelly storm off the field in protest if
Paul (Can't) Hackett decides to replace his quarterback, John Fox,
with Mike Van Raaphorst, as he's been known to do in the past?
</P>
<P>
   Will John Papadakis, the 300-pound beloved father of injured
Trojans' running back Petros Papadakis, invite the team over to his
San Pedro restaurant for the traditional pregame Greek repast, or
will he skip the annual ritual and, instead, Fed-Ex a crate of feta
cheese to the Trojans in protest of their lousy record?
</P>
<P>
   Will the Trojans win one for dear old Travis Claridge, their
senior right tackle who has started every game at USC since his
freshman season, meaning he has suffered unspeakable agony?
</P>
<P>
   Will Chad Morton score more touchdowns than DeShaun Foster?
</P>
<P>
   Will and this is on the lips of every fan in L.A. John Fox throw
more touchdown passes than Ryan McCann?
</P>
<P>
   What UCLA defense will show up, the one that yielded 55 points
to Oregon State or the one that shut down the Washington Huskies so
effectively last Saturday?
</P>
<P>
   What kind of trick plays does the tricky Bob Toledo have in
store for the Trojans?
</P>
<P>
   What kind of trick plays that the not so tricky Paul (Can't)
Hackett have in store for the Bruins?
</P>
<P>
   Where will the bus bringing the Bruins' players to the Coliseum
park?
</P>
<P>
   Is it true that Terry Donahue would savor a Bruins loss even
more than Trojan fans will?
</P>
<P>
   If the Trojans blow another one to the Bruins, will some wealthy
Trojan alum from Orange County step gallantly forward and offer to
buy out the remaining three years on Hackett's contract to save the
USC football program from imminent ruin?
</P>
<P>
   Does anyone other than the coaches, players, cheerleaders, band
members, alums and ADs oh, I'm sure UCLA's Peter (Principle) Dalis
is quaking in his bureaucratic Guccis even care about a about a
game whose unimportance this season is exceeded only by its
insignificance?

HEAD OF BRADLEY'S AD TEAM UNDER FIRE FOR JOE CAMEL WORK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Exclusive) (nk) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE and JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bill Bradley unveiled his first round of television
commercials Tuesday in his presidential campaign, but he came under
immediate attack from Vice President Al Gore's advisers for relying
on an advertising executive who once worked with the tobacco
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Kroll, the head of Bradley's advertising team, had
extensive contacts with tobacco industry executives when he was
chief executive officer of Young &AMP; Rubicam, one of the world's
largest advertising agencies. During Kroll's tenure, Young &AMP;
Rubicam handled the account that was responsible for the Joe Camel
commercials that marketed cigarettes to young people.
</P>
<P>
   While there are many documents linking Kroll to the tobacco
industry, it is not clear the degree of his relationships. In a
letter to Kroll in 1987, E.A. Horrigan Jr., then the vice chairman
of RJR Nabisco, thanked Kroll ``for agreeing to take time out of
your busy schedule to meet with me to discuss the unprecedented
assault on tobacco advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   And an internal RJR memorandum in 1991 showed that executives of
the tobacco company viewed Kroll as an official to turn to to
defend the Joe Camel account. The memorandum specifically suggested
that Kroll be given talking points to respond to criticism of the
campaign, which used cartoon renderings of a camel to pitch the
Camel brand.
</P>
<P>
   Kroll said in a telephone interview that he had had meetings
with tobacco executives, but insisted that he had no direct
involvement in the Joe Camel advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have had tobacco accounts since the beginning of
advertising,' ' Kroll said. ``It's highly irrelevant that I was
CEO. And that that in some way relates to the Bradley campaign is
preposterous. I was CEO of a company with 5,000 clients _ one of
which was R.J. Reynolds.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Did I have some meetings with these clients to
solicit their business? I'm sure I met with them at some time or
another. But this is eye opening to me that it's relevant. I wasn't
the creative director of the account. I wasn't the leader of the
account.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Gore campaign officials said they may pounce on Kroll's
links to the tobacco industry. In particularly one campaign
official, who spoke on the condition that his name not be used,
said it was hypocritical for Bradley to campaign on a promise of
protecting young people, particularly the poor, while working with
``a guy who was responsible for trying to sell tobacco products
right to inner city kids.''
</P>
<P>
   By criticizing the Bradley campaign, Gore officials might also
neutralize their own connections with tobacco. One of Gore's top
media consultants, Carter Eskew, has been widely denounced by
health organizations for helping the Philip Morris Cos. develop
television advertisements that sought to undercut support for a
planned federal lawsuit against the tobacco industry. He also
helped create a $40 million advertising blitz last year by the
cigarette industry that has been credited with helping defeat
federal anti-tobacco legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Anita Dunn, Bradley's communications director, suggested that
Eskew's involvement with the tobacco industry was far more serious
than Kroll's.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is really very little comparison to be made between
someone who years ago headed an advertising agency that happened to
have a client, and having as one of your top paid advisers someone
you hired while he was still working for the tobacco industry
having killed what the vice president called one of his top
legislative priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   The Joe Camel campaign, which was discontinued in 1997, was
highly successful for R.J. Reynolds. But it also was highly
controversial. Reynolds had said the campaign was intended to
appeal to younger adult smokers. But anti-smoking groups complained
that the cartoon appearance was designed to appeal to children.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Kroll was head of Young &AMP; Rubicam when it took over the Camel
account in 1989. About two years later, the agency lost the
account, with an estimated $30 million in annual advertising
spending, to an agency started by two former employees who had
worked on the account. Kroll retired from Young &AMP; Rubicam in late
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in the interview whether he had qualms _ then or now _
about the Joe Camel campaign, Kroll said: ``I can't answer that.
You're asking me to remember my feelings 15 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Kroll became friends with Bradley when they worked together in
1996 on the Advertising Council, the nonprofit organization that
produces public-service announcements. He is advising Bradley for
free, and has played a central role in recruiting other advertising
executives to help Bradley shape his message and image.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the Bradley campaign unveiled its first two
commercials, which feature the closing refrain: ``It can happen.''
The two spots will begin airing in New Hampshire on Wednesday and
in Iowa on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The first commercial is a 60-second biographical sketch that
attempts to cast Bradley as a caring, influential and experienced
politician with a diverse background.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat surprisingly, the commercial skips quickly across the
parts of Bradley's resume that he dwells on most in his stump
speeches _ his small-town upbringing in Crystal City, Mo., and his
experiences as a star basketball player _ while focusing on
Bradley's 18-year tenure as a senator from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bradley has sought to portray himself as a political
outsider, the commercial includes a shot of the Capitol dome and
has two veteran senators, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York and
Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, both Democrats, praising him as a fighter
for tax fairness and against racism.
</P>
<P>
   The second advertisement lasts 30 seconds and features Bradley
speaking directly into the camera about how he is attempting to run
a ``different campaign'' that concentrates on issues instead of
sound bites.

 &HT;    More firefighting help arriving to battle Georgia blazes
 &HT;    By Rick Badie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Another 100 firefighters are expected to join a
massive national effort today to stop wildfires raging in three
rain-deprived northeast Georgia counties.
</P>
<P>
   The specially-trained ``Hot Shot'' crews arriving today bring to
375 the number of firefighters from across the country who since
Monday have joined local firefighting efforts. The initial fires
started Saturday in the Blood Mountain Wilderness area, but since
then others have ignited in the volatile region. Forest Services
officials say the fire were deliberately set.
</P>
<P>
   Now six fires are burning about 2,500 acres, the most worrisome
being Rich Mountain in Gilmer County. One of three fires on that
mountain continued to burn late Tuesday, threatening about 700
acres.
</P>
<P>
   Uncontrolled fires continue to burn at Stanley Gap in Fannin
County and on Blood Mountain, southwest of Neels Gap. Another three
fires in Lumpkin County and one in Gilmer County were contained
Tuesday, but still burned.
</P>
<P>
   Forest Service officials worry that upslope winds, forest
foliage and dry conditions may spark fresh fires or rekindle
smothering ones. Firefighters will work through the night to
prevent the fires from spreading.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dealing with a pretty tough situation,'' said Mike
Melton, a commander overseeing the effort. ``This is rugged,
remote, tough terrain. We're dealing with the wilderness, some
private land and some federal land. And we've had a dry summer. We
need rain.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday morning, forest officials closed a 13-mile stretch of
the Appalachian Trail as well as access routes between Woody Gap
and Neels Gap. Two of the contained fires are located near Blood
Mountain, southwest of Neels Gap in Lumpkin County.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, smoke from the Rich Mountain fire was visible at
Woody Gap, about 10 miles north of Dahlonega. Firefighters spent
Tuesday battling blazes ranging from 6 to 10 feet high in rugged,
breath-taking terrain.
</P>
<P>
   ``That fire is going pretty good,'' said Dennis Daniel, a
district ranger with the U.S. Forest Service in Blairsville. ``And
it has the potential to get bigger. It's going to take significant
resources to get it under control.''
</P>
<P>
   The firefighters arriving today from the West will join their
colleagues in working 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily. That will allow
more crew members to be on hand in the middle of the day, ``when
everything is hottest,'' Melton said.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 firefighters battled the initial blaze on Blood
Mountain over the weekend.Three fires started about the same time
Saturday afternoon in the 7,800-acre wilderness area, which sprawls
across the Lumpkin-Union county line. Blood Mountain is Georgia's
highest point on the Appalachian Trail.
</P>
<P>
   No firefighters have been injured since crews from the
Chattahoochee National Forest, National Park Service, Georgia
Forestry Commission first began battling the blaze over the
weekend. Out-of-state firefighters hail from California, Puerto
Rico and New Mexico.

TORVALDS BUILDS EXPECTATIONS ABOUT NEW `SMART' CHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ For years now one of the most closely guarded
secrets in California's Silicon Valley has concerned what goes on
inside a one-story building in Mountain View known for its
dark-tinted windows.
</P>
<P>
   The company inside is Transmeta Corp., but few could say what it
did. Speculation about its motivations heated up when Transmeta
hired Linus Torvalds, developer of the Linux computer operating
system and a folk hero among many programmers.
</P>
<P>
   Then, speaking here Monday night before a crowd of 7,000 at
Comdex, the world's largest computer trade show, Torvalds began to
spill the beans. But not all of them.
</P>
<P>
   Transmeta, Torvalds said in the course of his talk, makes a
``smart'' microprocessor, the first built with software. But then,
when an audience member dared to ask Torvalds to elaborate, he
clammed up. He said he couldn't comment further. The company, he
said, would disclose full details on Jan. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Not unlike the ambiguous, adrenalin-charged teasers that
Hollywood produces for its untested blockbusters, the computer and
software industry is well known for building marketing buzz as it
labors to iron out kinks in new products.
</P>
<P>
   In Transmeta's case, this strategy is working.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's created hype by not creating hype,'' said Kevin Krewell,
senior analyst with MicroDesign Resources in Sunnyvale, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The computer elite at Linux Business Expo, a sideshow at Comdex,
say Torvald's comments, along with clues provided in four patents
Transmeta has filed with the US Patent Office since Nov. 3, 1998,
suggest the announcement may be worth the wait.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, microprocessors are providing the brainpower to
drive portable devices such as palm-size organizers and cellular
phones. Until now, they haven't been made to hold software, which
must sit separately on a computer's hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Transmeta, it seems, is out to change that, but exactly how
remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's controllable through software, you can download
upgrades directly onto the chip'' without having to physically
remove the chip from the computer and replace it with a new one,
said John Sherman, chief executive at Sherman &AMP; Associates, a
software developer in San Diego. ``Imagine having a Pentium II and
being able to just download software to change that chip to a
Pentium III.''
</P>
<P>
   Programmable microprocessors potentially mean the chip would
also morph from one type, say a chip made by Intel to run Microsoft
applications, to a Motorola chip that runs Apple Macintosh
software, said Christopher Bohan, an analyst with Headwaters
Capital, a securities trading firm in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``You already have software emulators that let you run an Intel
program on a Mac and vice versa, but that's very inefficient,''
said Bohan. ``This would make the transition a lot faster, and
that's one of the things that makes this a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   In the computer world where speed is a premium, anything that
makes software run faster is seen as a valuable commodity, making
the Transmeta microprocessor concept a potential milestone, said
Phil Hughes, publisher of Linux Journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know what they're doing, and they know they've got a
serious product,'' said Hughes, who believes the secrecy
surrounding Transmeta had to do with its desire not to tip its hand
to competitors. ``They see this as revolutionary, and they don't
want someone else to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   With its product now close to launch, Transmeta apparently
believes it is safe to release a few crumbs through Torvalds.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the company's one-page Web site, which previously was
blank, added another scrap for the hungry. Displaying the product's
name, ``Crusoe,'' the page proclaims: ``We rethought the
microprocessor to create a whole new world of mobility,''
suggesting that its new chip would be used in small, mobile
computing devices such as cellular phones or pocket-size ``Internet
appliances.''
</P>
<P>
   The site also has a ``secret message'' that can be accessed by
looking at the site's source code. The brief message said: ``Crusoe
will be cool hardware and software for mobile applications. Crusoe
will be unconventional, which is why we wanted to let you know in
advance to come look at the Web site in January, so that you can
get the full story and have access to all of the details as soon as
they are available.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Transmeta may be unconventional, its investors are
anything but. Among those who have banked on the company's future
are Vulcan Ventures, owned by Paul Allen, a founder of Microsoft
Corp. Others who have reportedly poured hundreds of millions into
Transmeta include Soros Funds, BankBoston Robertson Stephens, and
Institutional Venture Partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is: Will Crusoe live up to this level of
anticipation?'' said Krewell of MicroDesign Resources. ``The
Transmeta folks will say they haven't created expectations, because
they haven't said anything.''
</P>
<P>
   But here in Las Vegas, where the dice roll all night, they
certainly have created anticipation.

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a
quarter of a percentage point on Tuesday, saying that the
combination of strong growth and low unemployment had left the
economy vulnerable to an outbreak of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third time this year that the central bank had raised
rates to check the economy's momentum, and the move clearly
signaled that the Fed's growing faith in technology's ability to
improve business efficiency and temper inflationary pressures has
its limits.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining its action, the Fed emphasized a concern that Alan
Greenspan, the central bank's chairman, has stressed repeatedly in
recent months: that the nation is literally running out of workers
and that, as it does so, wages and then prices will inevitably be
pushed higher, endangering an economic expansion that is about to
become the longest in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed said it was raising its benchmark federal funds target
rate on overnight loans between banks to 5.5 percent from 5.25
percent after two other quarter-point increases this year, in June
and August. Tuesday's increase took back the last of three
quarter-point reductions made last year in response to the global
financial crisis and left the rate back where it was 14 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank also said it would increase its largely
symbolic discount rates on loans to financial institutions from the
Federal Reserve system to 5 percent from 4.75 percent. It was the
second quarter-point increase in the rate this year after two
quarter-point reductions last year.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in the Fed's official short-term rates quickly
began to affect the rates paid by businesses and consumers. Banks
started raising their prime lending rate by a quarter of a point,
to 8.5 percent, a move that will in turn lead to higher rates on
credit card, automobile and other consumer loans. Rates set
directly or indirectly in the bond market, like those for mortgage
loans, also edged up.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed seemed to leave open the possibility that it could raise
rates further next year if the economy keeps roaring along and
unemployment keeps falling. But for investors, the good news was a
hint from the Fed that it does not plan to raise rates again at
least for the rest of this year. The central bank said the
cumulative effect of its three rate increases this year ``should
markedly diminish the risk of inflation going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed also removed its formal stance toward higher rates,
moving instead to a neutral one that analysts said all but ruled
out a rate increase at the next monetary policy meeting, which is
on Dec. 21.

   The Dow Jones industrial average rose immediately after the
central bank's announcement Tuesday afternoon, fell back sharply,
then surged again to finish at 10,932.33, up 171.58 points.
</P>
<P>
   It was the highest level for the index in more than two months
and suggested that investors see no more rate increases coming
before the Fed's first meeting of 2000, on Feb. 1 and Feb. 2.
</P>
<P>
   The American economy has been growing steadily for more than
eight and a half years, driving unemployment down to 4.1 percent
last month _ the lowest level in nearly three decades _ while
allowing workers to enjoy higher wage gains than they have in
years. Yet there has been no solid evidence that inflation is
building, casting doubt on traditional economic models that predict
a trade-off between falling joblessness and rising wages and
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists have sought to explain the situation by
asserting that huge investments by businesses in computers and
other efficiency-enhancing technology are yielding substantial
improvements in productivity, or output per hour for each worker.
As productivity growth accelerates, it helps companies keep their
costs under control even if wages rise, making it possible for them
to maintain profit margins without increasing prices.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan and other Fed officials have increasingly come to
accept that recent gains in productivity are more than a temporary
blip, and they have been increasingly optimistic in their public
statements about the economy's resiliency and long-term growth
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   But in raising rates on Tuesday _ at a time when the economy is
already showing signs of slowing and price increases are well
contained _ Greenspan showed that he is not ready to abandon the
notion that low unemployment plus robust growth is a recipe for
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although cost pressures appear generally contained, risks to
sustainable growth persist,'' the Fed's Federal Open Market
Committee said in a statement released soon after 2:15 p.m.
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite tentative evidence of slowing in certain
interest-sensitive sectors of the economy and of accelerating
productivity, the expansion of activity continues in excess of the
economy's growth potential,'' the statement said. ``As a
consequence, the pool of available workers willing to take jobs has
been drawn down further in recent months, a trend that must
eventually be contained if inflationary imbalances are to remain in
check and economic expansion continue.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Economists had been sharply divided before Tuesday's meeting
about whether a rate increased would be justified, and the Fed's
decision led some of them to assert that the central bank was
failing to take account of the economy's improved capacity to grow
without inflation. They said the Fed should have taken more time to
let its previous two rate increases this year slow the economy and
ease pressure on labor markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this was a football game, I think I'd throw a yellow flag
for piling on,'' said Martin Regalia, an economist at the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Regalia said that while the Fed's ``rhetoric seems to have
shifted to an acceptance of productivity gains, their actions are
clearly more consistent with the traditional labor market tightness
arguments.''
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts said the economy was continuing to grow at a rate
greater than the 3 percent to 3.5 percent annual rate that is
widely viewed as a ``speed limit'' beyond which inflation can take
root.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fed believes, as I do, that the economy's speed limit is
higher than we thought it was a few years back, but that doesn't
mean in any sense that the economy does not still have a speed
limit,'' said Richard Berner, an economist at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter in New York.
</P>
<P>
   With growth exceeding that limit and showing no clear signs of
moderating, Berner said, ``the balance of inflation risks still
lies to the side of higher rather than lower inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before Tuesday's statement suggesting that the Fed will be
on hold for the rest of this year, analysts had expected the
central bank to leave rates untouched for several months because of
the uncertainty about how the Year 2000 computer problem will
affect the economy and the financial system.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, economists expect that it could be difficult
for the Fed to draw conclusions about the economy's path over the
next few months because statistics may be distorted by businesses
building extra inventory and consumers holding on to more cash than
they otherwise would. As a result, some analysts think the Fed
might shy away from raising rates at its February meeting even if
growth seems to remain strong.

 Simple Side Dishes Complement Turkey  &HT;       
 These recipes all come from ``The San Francisco Chronicle 
 Cookbook,'' by Michael Bauer and Fran Irwin (Chronicle Books,  &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; No Thanksgiving is complete without a tableful of
side dishes to accompany the traditional holiday turkey. The trick
is picking dishes that complement the bird without competing but
that are also wonderful in their own right. Picking and choosing
cooking method is important, too, since oven space is often at a
premium.
<P>
   Oven-Fried Sweet Potatoes are a great twist to grandma's sugary
sweet potato casserole. The addictive sweet potatoes caramelize in
the oven, giving off a natural sweetness.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bauer's Drunken Beans are a great alternative to plain
steamed green beans. Beans are added to a vodka reduction, which
glazes them beautifully. (All the alcohol is cooked off.)
</P>
<P>
   The pleasant bitter flavor of Braised Bitter Greens tempers the
richness of the rest of the holiday meal. And the combination of
fennel, orange and red onion make for a refreshing salad.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; MICHAEL BAUER'S DRUNKEN BEANS
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 medium onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/2 tablespoon freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup vodka
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon white vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 pound green beans
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat.
Add the onion, 1/2 teaspoon or so of the pepper, and a little salt.
Saute about 3 minutes. Turn heat to high and add 1/4 cup vodka and
the vinegar. Reduce to a glaze and add more vodka, salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Repeat with the final 1/4 cup of vodka. When the liquid has
evaporated, add the green beans and cover with water. Add more salt
and pepper and let boil over high heat until all the cooking liquid
has evaporated and forms a glaze on the vegetables. This should
take about 35 to 40 minutes.

</P>
<P>
   The slices of sweet potatoes become crispy and slightly
caramelized in the hot oven, bringing out their natural sweetness.
Pile them on a heated serving platter and let guests help
themselves. Some people, you will find, may enjoy eating them with
their fingers. This recipe, from Georgeanne Brennan, makes a nice
change from the traditional candied yam dish.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   5 pounds sweet potatoes (12 to 15 potatoes)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup + 3 or 4 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped fresh marjoram or thyme
</P>

   11/2 teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   11/2 teaspoons freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 475 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Peel the potatoes and cut them in half across the middle, then
cut the halves lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Put the
slices into a bowl and add 1/2 cup oil, the marjoram or thyme, salt
and pepper. Toss several times to coat the slices with oil and
seasonings.
</P>
<P>
   Spread the slices evenly in a single layer on baking sheets.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, then turn the slices and bake until
slightly crisped and tender, 5 to 7 minutes longer.
</P>
<P>
   Scoop the hot slices back into the bowl. Add the remaining 3 or
4 tablespoons oil and turn the slices until they glisten.

 LEARNING TO COOK: Cake Shines With Sprightly Cranberries  By Marion Cunningham  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  This old-fashioned recipe from 1920 still beats
most cakes for the simplicity of preparing it and wonderful texture
and taste. It looks festive served slightly warm with the cranberry
topping and whipped cream on the side and is a perfect choice for
the holidays.
<P>
   A good tool to have for making this cake _ and many other
recipes _ is a hand rotary beater. It is inexpensive and is easily
found in hardware stores and kitchen shops.
</P>
<P>
   This cake also freezes well, but wrap it in several sheets of
plastic wrap so it doesn't absorb other flavors from the freezer.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; CRANBERRY UPSIDE-DOWN CAKE
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   Topping
</P>
<P>
   21/2 cups fresh cranberries
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup light brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Cake Batter
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup vegetable shortening
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla
</P>
<P>
   2 eggs
</P>
<P>
   12/3 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   Whipped Cream
</P>
<P>
   1 cup heavy whipping cream
</P>
<P>
   3 or 4 tablespoons granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Making the Cake Topping:  &LR; Use a skillet with a 2-quart
capacity. If your skillet has a wooden or inflammable handle, wrap
it in several layers of aluminum foil.
</P>
<P>
   Put the cranberries in a colander and rinse under cold running
water. Remove any soft or shriveled cranberries and discard. Shake
the colander to get rid of excess water. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Melt the butter in the skillet over medium heat. Don't walk
away, stand and watch, giving a stir often. This only takes a
couple of minutes. As soon as the butter is melted, stir in the
brown sugar. Continue to cook, stirring until the sugar melts and
is bubbling a little. Remove from the burner and add the
cranberries, spreading them in a single layer in the sauce. Set the
skillet aside while you prepare the batter.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Making the Cake Batter:  &LR; Put the shortening into a mixing bowl
and add the sugar. Using the back of a large spoon, press and
smooth the shortening and sugar together. Keep blending until the
sugar and shortening are a single mass. (If you have an electric
mixer, this can be done quickly.) Add the vanilla and eggs. Beat
the mixture until it is all one color and smooth (again, an
electric mixer does this quickly, or a hand rotary beater will
smooth out lumps).
</P>
<P>
   Combine the flour, baking powder and salt in a bowl. Stir with a
fork to blend. Add the flour mixture to the creamed mixture, along
with the milk, beating until the batter is smooth and free of
lumps. Again, use a large spoon or a hand rotary beater.
</P>
<P>
   Spread the batter evenly over the cranberries.
</P>
<P>
   Bake for about 30 minutes, but check the cake for doneness after
25 minutes by inserting a straw or toothpick into the center of the
cake. If it comes out clean, the cake is done.
</P>
<P>
   Remove from the oven and let sit for 10 minutes, then put a
large serving plate over the skillet and turn the skillet upside
down. The cake will drop onto the platter.
</P>
<P>
   This is a lovely cake served slightly warm with whipped cream.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Whipped Cream:  &LR; Combine the cream and 3 tablespoons of the
sugar in a bowl. Beat, using a hand rotary beater or electric
mixer, only until soft peaks form. Taste the whipped cream for
sweetness and add more sugar if you like. Serve with the cake.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6 to 8.

FED RATE INCREASE REASSURES INVESTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve Board raised the federal funds and discount
rates Tuesday by a quarter of a percentage point to cool down the
economy, saying the nation is expanding in ``excess of its growth
potential.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq market index leaped to a record after the news, while
the Dow Jones industrial average staged a surprise rally, gaining
more than 170 points after the Fed's Open Market Committee
announced its decision at about 2:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Investors seemed reassured by the Fed's statement that it does
not intend to raise rates again in the near future, a promise it
had made in June after the first of the current round of increases
in the federal funds rate. Markets seemed to trust that this would
be the last rate increase for a while, given that the vote came on
the heels of recent government reports that inflation is low and
productivity is accelerating.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is saying, `We don't care if the Fed raised rates.
We just don't want it to do it again,' '' said William Rhodes, a
vice president in Boston for Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   He cautioned that if the government's report on the consumer
price index, to be released Wednesday, is ``really ugly, people
will begin to second guess what they said.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed, seeking to slow an economy that grew at a 4.8 percent
annual rate in this year's third quarter, said it would raise the
federal funds rate a quarter point, to 5.5 percent. That reinstated
the interest rate banks charge each other for overnight loans to
its level in 1998, before a money-loosening policy was instituted
to avert financial crises abroad and on Wall Street. The full
reversal was cited as another reason investors were confident
another rate hike is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed Tuesday also raised the discount rate that it charges
member banks by a quarter point, to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than focus on inflation _ the traditional reason for
raising rates _ the Fed tilted its reasoning subtly to focus on the
risks of a fast-growing economy. The gross domestic product, which
grew 4.3 percent in 1998, gained speed during the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although cost pressures appear generally contained,'' the Fed
statement said, ``risks to sustainable growth persist.'' Despite
strong productivity gains, ``the expansion of activity continues in
excess of the economy's growth potential.'' The excess growth has
drained the economy of workers, a trend that must be ``contained if
inflationary imbalances are to remain in check.''
</P>
<P>
   The rate increase, economists said, was inevitable, if not now
then early next year. Economists for months have predicted that the
Fed members would be compelled to take back all of the rate
reductions instituted during last year's global crisis, from which
the world economy has rebounded.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street was optimistic it had seen the last of the rate
hikes. The Dow rose 171.58 points, up 1.6 percent to a 10,932.33
close. The Nasdaq index gained 25.64 points; the 1.84 percent rise
in the technology-heavy index pushed it to a new record, 3293.05.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the time being there's a closure here,'' said Dick Rippe,
economist for Prudential Securities Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Reading the tea leaves in the Fed's statement, economists noted
that it contained some ambivalence _ even confusion _ about what to
do in this unusual period of rapid growth and low, low inflation.
</P>
<P>
   In this booming economy, extremely high productivity, due to
investment in computer technology by corporate America, has been a
key force in keeping inflation in check. Productivity rose at an
astonishing 4.2 percent rate in the July-September quarter,
continuing a trend started more than a year ago that is credited
with keeping wage costs, a component of inflation, in check. The
Labor Department also reported recently that producer prices in
October fell by 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of the argument the United States is experiencing a
technology-driven boom _ the ``New Economy'' _ criticized the Fed
for its latest rate hike. Wayne Angell, a former Fed governor and
now senior managing director at Bear Stearns &AMP; Co., said, ``We have
a huge rate of return on capital in the United States, which is
giving us a wonderful world that is benefitting everyone.'' Yet, he
said, ``the Fed seems dissatisfied with this near-utopy condition
that has developed.''
</P>
<P>
   With inflation relatively low, Nicholas Perna, an economist with
Perna Associates, said the Fed gave other arguments for its rate
increase. In order to increase rates, he said, the Fed ``said if we
continue to grow as fast as we are we'll have a problem,'' Perna
said.
</P>
<P>
   This does not, he warned, preclude the Fed from raising rates
again next year.

 &HT;    Business entities like sound of U.S.-China trade pact
 &HT;    By Ben Sutherly
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TROY, Ohio _ The trade accord reached Monday between China and
the United States is drawing measured but hopeful reactions from
commodity groups and brokers hungry for more details.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it positive? Yes. To what extent? I think it's too early to
tell,'' said Bob Linkhorn, president of Limaco Inc., an Urbana cash
grain broker and agrimarketing consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Linkhorn said the deal will be no ``short-term fix'' for low
soybean prices. But he said hopes for long-term Sino-U.S. trade
relations underpin the agreement, which would reduce beef and pork
tariffs from 45 and 20 percent, respectively, to 12 percent for
both products by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   News of the accord pleased American Soybean Association
officials, who said China and Hong Kong took in about $890 million,
or 12 percent, of U.S. soy exports last year _ just four years
after China exported some of its soybean products.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a major leap forward. We think China will continue to be
our largest growth opportunity for U.S. soybeans,'' said Bob
Callanan, ASA communications director.
</P>
<P>
   Callanan said China's booming economy and increased per capita
spending are fueling unprecedented demand for soybeans and other
soy products. He said China already consumes more U.S.-processed
soybean oil than any other country.
</P>
<P>
   Callanan said ASA will urge Congress to grant China permanent
``normal trade relations'' status if the country becomes part of
the 135-nation World Trade Organization. Currently, uninterrupted
trade with China requires annual congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   The pact with China also is raising hopes within Delphi
Automotive Systems Inc.,
</P>
<P>
   Delphi spokesman Peter Rowe said, ``Delphi is eager to review
the details of the agreement to assure it will open up
opportunities for our company.''
</P>
<P>
   He said company officials are ``delighted'' that negotiators for
the two countries reached an agreement and hope the other World
Trade Organization members will do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Membership in the WTO will help China continue economic
reforms, accelerate their progress into the market economy and
improve the living standards for all Chinese citizens,'' Rowe said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.-China trade agreement will likely help NCR Corp.'s
efforts to sell automatic teller machines, cash register and store
systems and data warehousing systems, said Sajid Malhotra, NCR's
investor relations vice president.
</P>
<P>
   NCR opened an ATM manufacturing plant in Beijing last month and
has plans to sell ATMs and other products in emerging markets such
as China and India, Malhotra said. ``We have no doubt ATMs will
present huge opportunities in India and China because these are
both cash-based economies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While there is one ATM for every 15,000 people in the U.S.,
there is only one ATM for every 1 million people in China and one
for every 10 million in India. China and India make up one-third of
the world's 6 billion people.
</P>
<P>
   NCR has been doing business in China for 10 years and holds 40
percent of the ATM market.
</P>
<P>
   Malhotra said ATM deployment in China depends more on acceptance
by local banks than the new trade agreement. But as foreign banks
move in and offer ATMs, it may prompt Chinese banks to use them
too, Malhotra said.
</P>
<P>
   NCR has some customers in China that have NCR data warehouses _
large computer systems to track vast amounts of information, he
said. However, China lacks national or regional retailers similar
to Wal-Mart or Home Depot so it is more difficult for NCR to sell
cash register and retail computer systems to smaller stores and
operations, he said. _ Staff Writers Lynn Hulsey and Laura A.
Bischoff contributed to this report.

EDITORS NOTE: Each week, wine editor Gerald Boyd discusses a
variety of wine topics.  WINE POTPOURRI: Light and Fruity Goes Great With Thanksgiving 
 &HT;       
 Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Thanksgiving ranks high on the list of popular
American holidays. Why? My guess is that people like Thanksgiving
because it has no political or religious connection. Instead,
Thanksgiving is a day for families and friends to come together and
celebrate the American way of life.
<P>
   Of course, that American way of life often means eating, eating
and more eating. Thanksgiving meals are personal, with favorite
dishes showing up on the table year after year. Although the meal
usually revolves around the traditional bird, the range of side
dishes bring on a variety of flavors and seasonings that challenge
even the most creative wine drinker.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you could wimp out and go for the safe-three: a
simple semi-dry white, a fruity ros &LR; e &LR;  and a user-friendly red.
You'd have all the bases covered but the easy way out doesn't say
much for your wine choices.
</P>
<P>
   The meat _ turkey, ham _ whatever, is not as important as the
side dishes. Turkey breast meat on its own is fairly bland and
lightly flavored, usually calling for a light white or red wine.
Dress up the meat with gravy, a scoop of seasoned dressing and some
cranberry sauce and a light white disappears under flavor overkill.
</P>
<P>
   What's needed is a wine with more guts and maybe a little
sweetness, like Riesling, Chenin Blanc or a light red such as
Beaujolais or a California Gamay. Another ideal choice with this
menu is a dry to semi-dry fruity rose, especially if the meat of
choice is ham. As for the candied yams; lose the wine and buy a
bottle of sweet apple cider instead.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you can't get through the day without Cabernet Sauvignon
or Chardonnay, leave those wines for another meal. Most popular
Chardonnays are too oaky and most Cabernets are too young and
tannic, setting up serious confrontations with traditional
Thanksgiving side dishes. Keep the wine simple and fruity,
including Merlot and Zinfandel, unless you can find a light and
fruity example of either wine where oak is not the dominant
component, as it is in many of the young reds now on retail
shelves.
</P>
<P>
   The main thing is to relax, enjoy the day and the meal and don't
worry about the wine. A traditional Thanksgiving meal is not the
time to bring out your best bottles.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Other Wine Choices &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Two wines that pop up this time of year is Beaujolais and
sparkling wines. Both are good choices with Thanksgiving dinner.
</P>
<P>
   French Beaujolais Nouveau, the first red wine of the new vintage
is released the third Thursday of November and on store shelves
soon after. Nouveau is the ultimate quaffing wine, fruity, grapey
and very drinkable, just the kind of red wine to complement a range
of Thanksgiving flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Sparkling wines are more problematic, since some people find the
bubbles get in the way of a good meal. And a good match is needed
so the delicate fruit of most sparklers isn't overwhelmed. If
bubbly is your choice for Thanksgiving meal, stay with California
Blanc de Noirs or Extra Dry, Italian Asti Spumante or French
sparkling Vouvray.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Peter Mondavi Rare Wines &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Peter Mondavi Family, owner of Charles Krug Winery in the
Napa Valley, has released a selection of 4000 bottles of Charles
Krug Vintage Selection Cabernet Sauvignons dating back to 1974.
Bottle sizes range from 750 ml to 18 liter, with an emphasis on
larger bottles. All wines have been stored in the winery's cellar.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, contact Andy Fromm at (707) 967-2214.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Wine Q &AMP; A &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In September, a reader asked about a wine reviewed in the
Chronicle Wine Selections, called Buffalo Ridge Syrah. We had the
wine but not the producer. Then, thanks to alert readers, the
mystery was solved. The Buffalo Ridge brand is owned by winemaker
Tom Eddy, with the Syrah grapes coming from the French Camp
Vineyard in the Central Coast. You can reach Eddy in Napa at (707)
462-7196.
</P>
<P>
   Sasikala Devi of McKinleyville wrote to say she thinks wine is
``bloody sour grape juice,'' and it's ``too trendy and too pc.''
Devi enjoyed a recent Potpourri on Sherry and asked if I would ever
consider writing about other fortified wines like Port and Madeira?
You bet. In fact, I've written about both Port and Madeira and plan
to write more about these two excellent, but often ignored, wines
in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Plan for the Future &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If you like Australian wines, especially reds from the Barossa
Valley, McLaren Vale and Coonawarra, set your sights on the red
wines of the excellent 1998 vintage. A vintage chart, based on a
scale where 10 is perfection, published by the Australian Wine
Export Council gives a 10 to Coonawarra reds and a 9 to red wines
from the Barossa Valley and McLaren Vale.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Mixable Cognac &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to crack the growing market of generation x-ers,
Cognac producers are also spending a lot of time, effort and money
on promoting the ``mixability'' of Cognac. Not since the first
Cognacs were sipped in the 15th century has there been much
interest in serving Cognac any other way but straight, as an
after-dinner drink.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a refreshing drink is a blend of Cognac and tonic. The
Cognac producers enjoy Cognac with crushed ice, ginger ale and
tonic.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Refreshing News &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't happen often, but a California winery is dropping
Chardonnay from its line in favor of a lesser-known white wine.
</P>
<P>
   Napa Valley's Swanson Vineyards has decided to stop making
Chardonnay and concentrate on Pinot Grigio. The 1997 vintage of
Swanson Carneros Chardonnay is the winery's last. Swanson also
produces Syrah, Merlot, Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon.

 texture in perfect ending for Thanksgiving feast 
 &HT;

 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  Tony Gulisano may have his heart in Italy, but he
has a way with American desserts.
<P>
   At his new Park Chow, a sister restaurant to his moderately
priced Chow in the Castro, the chef serves a spectacular version of
pecan pie.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with most pecan pie recipes is that they are so rich
and sweet that the nuts seem like an afterthought. Gulisano doesn't
skimp on the ingredients; the filling is cooked giving it a silken
texture. During baking the pecans rise to the top.
</P>
<P>
   This is only one of the homey pies he serves at his
Italian-style restaurant; it could be butterscotch banana or
coconut cream.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Guliasano makes a great roast chicken and an
old-fashioned spaghetti and meatballs. Few dishes are more than
$10.

<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; _ &UR; Boiling the filling. &LR;  Pecan pie filling is rarely cooked before
being poured into the shell and baked. It's a technique usually
reserved for chess pies.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Freezing the pie shell. &LR;  The unbaked pie shell is placed in
the freezer briefly so when the filling is poured in, the crust
will stay firm.
</P>
<P>

reliable flavor and texture.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; BUTTER PECAN PIE
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   The Crust
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour + additional flour for
rolling pastry
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon sea salt
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup (6 ounces) chilled unsalted butter, cut into cubes
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup ice water
</P>
<P>
   The Filling
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups pecans (halves and pieces)
</P>
<P>
   1 cup C &AMP; H golden brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 scant cup light corn syrup
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon sea salt
</P>
<P>
   3 eggs, lightly beaten
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla
</P>
<P>
   Vanilla ice cream or lightly whipped cream
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the crust:  &LR; Combine the 11/2 cups flour and the salt in
a food processor and mix briefly. Gradually add the butter to the
flour mixture while pulsing the processor on and off, until the
butter is cut into pieces the size of small peas. With the
processor running, gradually add the ice water and process until
large clumps form. Remove the dough from the processor, shape into
a ball, and flatten into a disk. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate 1
hour.
</P>
<P>
   Let the dough soften slightly at room temperature. Roll the
dough on a lightly floured surface into a 13-inch round. Carefully
transfer the dough to a 9-inch pie pan. Trim any dough hanging over
the edge. Crimp the edges decoratively. Freeze for 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the filling:  &LR; Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Combine
the pecans, brown sugar, corn syrup, butter, flour and salt in a
heavy saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, stirring
constantly. Remove from heat. Cool 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Whisk together the eggs and vanilla. Stir about 1/2 cup of the
hot sugar mixture into the eggs to temper them, then stir this
mixture into the hot sugar mixture. Pour the filling into the pie
shell.
</P>
<P>
   Bake 10 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 325. Bake until
the custard has set and the nuts rise to the top, about 30 to 40
minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool.
</P>
<P>
   Serve with ice cream or whipped cream.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 8.

COMMENTARY: NEXT, IT'S E-DUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The two most telling stories about the 10th anniversary of the
fall of the Berlin Wall actually ran in the business sections of
The New York Times and The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   One was a short article in the back pages of The New York Times
that reported that the number of adults using the Internet in the
United States had surpassed 100 million, meaning that roughly half
the U.S. population is now online.
</P>
<P>
   The other article, in The Post, noted that Amazon.com was
shipping an extraordinary number of copies of Adolf Hitler's racist
manifesto, ``Mein Kampf,'' to buyers in Germany. It is illegal to
sell ``Mein Kampf'' in bookstores in Germany or publish it there.
But as we move from the world of Borders books to the world of
borderless books, a k a Amazon.com, Germans can order ``Mein
Kampf'' online and have it delivered by mail, and their government
is powerless to stop it. Indeed, Amazon shipped so many copies of
``Mein Kampf'' to Germany that over the summer Hitler made Amazon's
top 10 best-seller list among German buyers.
</P>
<P>
   What these two little stories tell is that 10 years after the
fall of the Berlin Wall a whole other set of walls is starting to
fall, as we move deeper into the Internet revolution. And this is
not simply an American phenomenon, nor, as the ``Mein Kampf''
example illustrates, will it automatically bring out the best in
people.
</P>
<P>
   So what comes next? With the first phase of this wall-destroying
Internet revolution _ the e-mail and e-commerce phase _ now fully
under way, I posed that question to John Chambers. Chambers runs
Cisco Systems, which makes the routers that run the Internet.
Beware: He has an obvious stake in touting the Internet. But note:
His past predictions have proved extremely accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers argued that the second phase of the Internet revolution
_ businesses absorbing the Internet and using it to relate to one
another _ was now just getting under way, and that this was going
to be a monster market. There is barely a CEO in the developed
world who in the last six months hasn't said to himself: ``Oh my
God! This Internet thing is real. Somebody call me an Internet
doctor and wire me up.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a CEO understands that absorbing the Net into every aspect
of his or her business ``is the only way they are going to
survive,'' said Chambers, ``they are going to be spending big bucks
on it. That's why I believe that Y2K will be short-lived, and after
that we are going to see one of the best years the computer
industry has ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   So now that commerce has moved to the Net, and the Net is moving
into business, what comes after that?
</P>
<P>
   ``Education,'' said Chambers. ``The next big killer application
for the Internet is going to be education. Education over the
Internet is going to be so big it is going to make e-mail usage
look like a rounding error'' in terms of the Internet capacity it
will consume.
</P>
<P>
   What will drive it will be the demands on companies, in an
intensely competitive global economy, to keep improving
productivity. E-learning, insists Chambers, if done right, can
provide faster learning, at lower costs, with more accountability,
thereby enabling both companies and schools to keep up with changes
in the global economy that now occur at Net speed. Schools and
countries that ignore this, he says, will suffer the same fate as
big department stores who thought e-commerce was overrated.
</P>
<P>
   If universities move properly, they will offer the ideal
combination of online and instructor-led learning, argues Chambers.
But if universities don't reinvent their curriculums and how they
deliver them, for an increasingly Net-driven economy, many
students, particularly in information technology fields, ``will go
to schools online,'' he says. Many big firms _ Cisco, GE, IBM, AT&AMP;T
_ are starting online academies to train new employees and to
constantly upgrade the skills of existing ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike in the industrial revolution when you had to be in the
right country or city to participate, in this new era capital will
flow to whichever countries and companies install the best Internet
and educational capabilities,'' says Chambers. Governments and
unions will be powerless to stop this capital flow, which will
affect the global balance of economic power. Although the
technology exists today, this revolution will take about 10 years
to be fully in place. But, insists Chambers, ``it's coming next.''

 COOK'S BOOKS: Restaurant Recipes Inspire Boulud's Cookbook  &HT;     By Karola Saekel  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Some famous-chef cookbooks dazzle with extravagant
victuals and preparations. Celebrated chef Daniel Boulud's
just-published book shines with a simple love of food and respect
for ingredients.
<P>
   The book is modeled after the menus of his New York restaurant
Caf &LR; e &LR;  Boulud, where dishes are listed in four categories _ La
Tradition (classic French), La Saison (pick of the seasonal
provender), Le Voyage (garnered from cuisines around the world),
and Le Potager (from the garden). Diners at Caf &LR; e &LR;  Boulud are
encouraged to skip from category to category with their taste buds
as the only guide. The chef invites readers of ``Caf &LR; e &LR;  Boulud
Cookbook'' to do the same, and it's splendid advice.
</P>
<P>
   Boulud admits he takes a few liberties with traditional recipes.
He embellishes &LR;  garbure &LR;  (thick French peasant soup, usually based
on potatoes and cabbage) with lobster and duck confit _
unquestionably more  &LR; haute &LR;  than the hearty dish served at Caf &LR; e &LR; 
Boulud near Lyon, which was started by his great-grandparents. But
he says the spirit and soul of the original farmhouse dish are
intact.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, many of the book's recipes seem complicated,
but the reason is not that many orchestrate a kitchen tour de force
(some do), but rather Boulud gives us the whole dish, including
side dishes and garnishes. This is a fine idea: If you wish, you
can recreate the whole experience of a meal; if you are not that
ambitious, you can simply cull the main part from the description.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Veal Gremolata with Kale Polenta is an inspired
combination, but either the veal tournedos with their savory
gremolata topping or the fried polenta cakes could be paired with
other, simpler foods. The three chocolate mousses layered in a
martini glass at the cafe could be served without the additional
chocolate sauce and garnish. For that matter, any one of them would
be delicious by itself.
</P>
<P>
   The chef/author's practical bent will endear him to home cooks.
He has you prepare a simple scallop and tomato gratin in individual
gratin dishes _ unless you just want to put the whole dish for six
into one pie plate. He details many classic techniques, but also
makes frequent use of labor-saving devices like the blender and
food processor. And he writes that Clams Casino are a great party
starter, because who could be standoffish when everybody is sitting
there licking their fingers?
</P>
<P>
   Boulud comes across as a man who harmoniously blends his French
past and his American present. Take Sea Scallops on Crushed
Potatoes, Sauce Charcuti &LR; e &LR; re: The scallops are an American
standby, as are the potatoes, baked, their flesh coarsely crushed
with lots of butter, shallots and parsley. But he finishes the dish
with sauce  &LR; charcutiere &LR; , a traditional French sauce of wine,
vinegar, ham and cornichons usually accompanying pork. The
juxtaposition of the sweetness of the seafood and the savory
acidity of the sauce is superb. We can barely wait for spring to
try the Chilled Spring Pea Soup made with English sweet, sugar snap
and snow peas, fava beans and leeks and onions, highlighted with
bacon and cream. But we celebrated autumn with a marvelous chicken
dish with pearl onions, apples and quince that's virtually a
one-dish meal.
</P>
<P>
   For a thoroughly practical finale, Boulud and co-author Dorie
Greenspan include a glossary of terms, ingredients and techniques,
a source list, a guide to kitchen tools and a handful of base
recipes _ stocks, vinaigrette, a tomato confit of many uses and the
recipes for several pastry crusts, including an aptly named P &LR; a &LR; te
Sublime that yields three crusts. No freezer should be without one.

</P>
<P>
   6 ounces pearl onions, peeled and trimmed
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 cinnamon stick
</P>
<P>
   1 sprig rosemary
</P>
<P>
   1 Granny Smith apple, peeled, cored and cut into 1-inch chunks
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon honey
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup unsalted chicken stock, store-bought low-sodium broth,
or water
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Bring 2 quarts of salted water to a boil in a medium pot. Add 1
tablespoon of the vinegar and the quince and boil gently for 10
minutes. Drain the quince well and set aside to cool; pat dry
between paper towels if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a large oven-proof saute pan or skillet over
high heat. Season the chicken with salt and pepper and add the
pieces to the pan, skin side down. Brown the chicken for 5 to 7
minutes, then turn the pieces over and brown the other side for 5
minutes. Transfer the chicken to a plate and reserve.
</P>
<P>
   You need about 2 tablespoons oil for the next step, so pour off
any excess from the pan. Lower the heat to medium and add the
onions, sugar, cinnamon and rosemary to the pan. Season with salt
and pepper and, turning often, brown the onions evenly, 8 to 10
minutes. Return the chicken to the pan along with the quince, apple
and honey. Turn to coat the ingredients with the honey, then cook
for another 8 to 10 minutes to lightly caramelize everything. Add
the remaining 1/2 cup vinegar, stirring and scraping up any bits
that may have stuck to the bottom of the pan.
</P>
<P>
   Slide the pan into the oven and roast the chicken for 10
minutes. Transfer the pan to the stove-top again, turn the heat to
medium and add the chicken stock or water, bringing it just to the
boil. Stir to blend.
</P>
<P>
   Discard the cinnamon and rosemary and spoon the chicken, fruit
and sauce directly from the pan at the table.

EDITORS NOTE: Each week, The San Francisco Chronicle's panel of
professional tasters tries a different product available in
supermarkets.   TASTER'S CHOICE: Upbringing Makes Diestel Winning Bird  
   
 By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Now that you know the best way to cook a turkey
(see related story), which brand of turkey should you start out
with to get the best result? Or does the brand make no difference
at all?
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some people swear by fresh turkeys; others insist that frozen
turkeys preserve the bird's flavor at its peak. Then there's the
question of free-range.
</P>
<P>
   Today's panel tasted nine brands of turkey, including frozen,
fresh and free-range, ranging in price from 79 cents per pound to
$2.79 per pound.
</P>
<P>
   All weighed between 11 and 15 pounds. They were cooked
simultaneously at the California Culinary Academy in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   When the turkeys came out of the oven, they all looked the same.
Each sported crispy looking, nicely browned skin. But flavor was
another story.
</P>
<P>
   The turkeys were allowed to rest for 15 to 20 minutes before
being carved. Then each panelist was given dark meat and center
cuts of breast meat _ the breast was removed from the bone after
roasting and cut crosswise into slices so each panelist received
meat close to the skin as well as close to the bone.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the fresh turkeys fared much better than the frozen
birds. Only one of the frozen turkeys scored above 50 points.
</P>
<P>
   Those who believe that more exercise for turkeys means more
flavor may be right: three of the top four spots went to free-range
turkeys.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture allows turkeys to be labeled
and marketed as free-range if they are allowed to roam outside
(still within a confined area). That doesn't mean that the birds
actually  &LR; do &LR;  walk around, but they must be given the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it may be something other than just the
free-range label that makes a great turkey. What the free-range
distinction does  &LR; not &LR;  define is how much space the birds have in
which to roam, what they eat, whether they have been given
antibiotics or how they have been slaughtered and processed.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Diestel of Diestel Turkey Ranch in Sonora says two other
components make a big difference in the flavor of turkeys: the feed
and how old turkeys are when they're slaughtered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We give the turkey time to grow up naturally,'' she says. They
refer to it as ``real flavor from real time.''
</P>
<P>
   Diestel turkeys are raised on vegetarian feed, made up primarily
of corn, and soybeans, with no added fat. The birds are 20 to 24
weeks when they're slaughtered, as opposed to most commercially
raised turkeys which are 10 to 12 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   According to the panel, what Diestel is doing makes a big
difference. &UR; Diestel Turkey Ranch &LR;  ($1.59-$2.79 per pound at many
supermarkets) outscored its closest competitors by a large margin.
</P>
<P>
   All of the panelists commented on Diestel's exceptional
moistness _ two pointed out that it was even juicy when cold. Two
panelists also commented that the flavor was exceptional. Another
described it as ``everything a turkey should be.'' All would buy
it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Willie Bird  &LR; ($1.89-$2.09 per pound at many supermarkets) _
another fresh, free-range turkey _ took second place. Three
panelists enjoyed the turkey flavor; one described it as a ``clean
turkey flavor.'' Two others liked it less, finding it lower in
flavor than Diestel and not as moist. Three would buy it, one might
buy it, one would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Foster Farms &LR;  ($1.39 per pound at Cala) came in third, ranked
just below Willie Bird (which is as much as 70 cents more per
pound). Three tasters found this fresh turkey particularly moist
and liked the flavor. However, one dissenter described it as
virtually flavorless. Three would buy it, one might buy it, and one
would not.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth place went to  &UR; Norbest &LR;  (89 cents-$1.89 per pound at some
supermarkets), which is free-range but frozen. One panelist thought
the meat was moist and dense although somewhat tough. Another said
gravy might moisten it nicely. Three liked the flavor, but all
noted it was not as flavorful as Diestel and Willie Bird. Two would
buy it, one might buy it, and two would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Zacky Farms &LR;  ($1.29-$1.59 per pound at many supermarkets) came
in fifth. Panelists found this fresh turkey (not free-range) to be
dry. One panelist also described the texture as ``powdery.'' But
two tasters found it just as full-flavored as the top-scoring
brands. One would buy it, two might buy it, and two would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Butterball &LR;  ($1.29 per pound at some supermarkets) came in
sixth. Three panelists described this frozen (not free-range)
self-basting turkey stringy. One liked the flavor and juiciness,
but another described the meat as ``firm and tough.'' One would buy
it, two might buy it and two would not.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also tasted Empire, Safeway Select and The
Californian, but these turkeys were not ranked.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Panelists were John P. Carroll, cookbook author; Donna Katzl,
chef-owner, Cafe For All Seasons, San Francisco; Roland Passot,
chef-owner of La Folie in San Francisco and Left Bank in Larkspur
and Menlo Park; Kim Severson, Chronicle staff writer; and Kirk
Webber, chef-owner, Cafe Kati, San Francisco. All products are
tasted blind. &QL;

 &HT;    Delphi employees will not get negotiated raise
 &HT;    By Lynn Hulsey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Workers at one of three unprofitable Delphi
Automotive Systems plants will not receive proposed salary
increases negotiated by their national labor union, but employees
represented by a different union are getting pay increases.
</P>
<P>
   A Delphi spokesman and officials of the United Auto Workers of
America and the International Union of Electronic Workers sought to
minimize the difference, saying the plants face different
competitive issues and so have different ``fix-it'' agreements with
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Delphi spokesman Jim Hagedon and Gary Hill, president of the UAW
Local 696, confirmed that the 2,600 Delphi employees at brake
plants on Wisconsin and Needmore roads will receive the 3 percent
annual salary increases the UAW negotiated for members in
September's four-year contract agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But the 2,200 workers at Delphi's Kettering, Ohio, suspension
plant will not receive the 3 percent annual increases negotiated as
part of the tentative four-year contract agreement announced Monday
by the IUE.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had to do what they had to do to keep the plants open,''
said Denny Thomas, secretary/treasurer of the IUE District Council
7.
</P>
<P>
   Delphi spokesman Peter Rowe said the company does not make
public the average worker's salary, nor does it break out wages by
union representation. But the average Delphi employee earns $43.71
an hour in wages and benefits, he said.
</P>
<P>
   IUE negotiators were successful in getting Delphi to add one
year to the existing three-year ``no close'' pledge for the
Kettering plant and to give those employees the $1,350 signing
bonus negotiated for other IUE members.
</P>
<P>
   The Kettering plant and those on Wisconsin and Needmore roads
are working under local contracts with ``fix-it'' plans designed to
save them from sale or closure. The company has said the three are
on target for becoming profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Union and company officials have refused to divulge details
those agreements, but Hagedon said the ``fix-it'' plans recognize
the plants produce two different products and need different
agreements to compete.
</P>
<P>
   The IUE tentative four-year contract announced Monday also
covers General Motors workers. Ratification is expected to be
completed by Nov. 23. It covers 20,000 workers nationwide and 9,600
locally. In addition to the pay raise and bonus, the pact offers
better job security provisions and improves pensions and the
cost-of-living formula.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors officials could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The 450 workers at the GM Moraine engine plant scheduled to be
replaced by the new Isuzu-GM engine plant will be covered under the
new pact until their union negotiates a new deal, said Stephen
Trent, IUE Local 801 shop chairman at the engine plant.
</P>
<P>
   Isuzu is the majority owner in the new engine plant, known as
DMAX, but a bargaining agreement reached in 1998 will continue to
protect workers' GM pensions and retain retirement rules and some
other benefits. He said workers won't move off the GM payroll until
the second quarter of 2000, so an agreement needs to be in place by
then.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would rather remain a GM employee, but the union
needed to work with the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ultimately better than no jobs,'' said Trent.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike area Delphi and GM plants that are covered by both
national and local contracts with the companies, Local 801 is
likely to negotiate a single master agreement for the DMAX plant,
Trent said.

AS DEADLINE PASSES, FEW OVERDUE BANK LOANS IN PAKISTAN REPAID 
</HEADLINE>
  (mcd) 
 By BARRY BEARAK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan _ A deadline for some of the most wealthy
deadbeats here expired on Tuesday, with only a pittance in overdue
bank loans repaid and leaving the nation to wonder whether its new
military government will _ as promised _ begin putting a who's who
of the high and mighty behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   By early Wednesday morning, just after the midnight time limit,
no announcements of arrests had been made. ``Details are still
being worked out,'' said a top official who insisted on anonymity.
``Dozens of willful defaulters will go to jail. But remember, our
object is not to fill the prisons or close down businesses, but to
recover money.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, the effort has so far been a failure. According to
bankers, 1 percent of the $4.2 billion in bad loans has been
collected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the defaulters do their defaulting with finesse,'' the
area manager here in Islamabad for Emirates Bank International,
Akbar Alam, said. ``They don't keep the money in their own name,
and many don't even keep it in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after seizing control in a bloodless coup on Oct. 12, Gen.
Pervez Musharraf declared war on high-level corruption. Leading his
list of evildoers were the well-connected wealthy who are accused
of having borrowed money that they had no intention of repaying.
The general, trying fist-pounding populism, gave them a month to
make good on their debts.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week, lists of prominent debtors have been appearing
in newspapers. At the top was a family that owed $66.8 million.
Close behind was the family of the ousted prime minister, Nawaz
Sharif, whose arrears were placed at $42.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Banks have been taking out advertisements that announce, ``The
last day for settlement'' is drawing near. Working hours were
extended to have loan officers available for borrowers who were
gripped with fear or stricken with conscience.
</P>
<P>
   But as the deadline approached, the pressure seemed to diminish
rather than grow. The new government itself began to hedge.
</P>
<P>
   Shaukat Aziz, who gave up a job as a Citibank vice president to
be finance minister, declared on Nov. 5, ``The cancer of corruption
has reached a point where it is now eating away at the vitals of
our societal body.''
</P>
<P>
   But by last weekend he was saying that ``only a small group''
had willfully deceived the banks and that the law had to proceed
with ``equity, justice and reasonableness.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere along the way, the new government realized that
although there was abundant financial skulduggery, the greater
amount of the debt stemmed from genuinely honest-to-goodness
failures. What is more, there was a worry that the net effects of
the crackdown would make businessmen heed the wisdom of
Shakespeare, neither a borrower nor lender be, a conservative
financial strategy that does not make for a very dynamic economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this hue and cry is not good for Pakistan,'' said M.
Masood Ahmed, who is in charge of loan recovery for the United Bank
in Islamabad. ``The government is destroying the culture of
banking, with every Tom, Dick and Harry getting their names
published as defaulters. Foreign investors are not going to be
interested in Pakistan now.''
</P>
<P>
   The nation itself is at the cliff's edge of bankruptcy, owing
$32 billion to international creditors. About 57 percent of all
revenues, Aziz said, goes toward servicing the debt.

 CHRON  
EDITORS NOTE: The Chronicle regularly features ``Best Way'', a
column in which the Food staff tries to establish the most reliable
way to cook many of our favorite foods.  The Turkey Bunch: Here's the story, of a flock of turkeys  
 That were cooked up almost 30 different ways...  
   
 By Lynne Bennett  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Thanksgiving means tempting turkeys with brown
crispy skin, luscious rich dark meat and succulent white meat.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But talk to a dozen people and you'll get a dozen opinions of
how to roast the perfect bird _ low, high or variable heat; basted,
brined or stuffed; draped with butter-soaked cheesecloth, breast
down then up or up then down; roasted in a bag; deep-fried, grilled
or smoked. And we won't even go into how the Pilgrims might have
cooked their turkeys.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle Food staff set out to determine the best way to
oven-roast a holiday turkey. We also delved into deep-frying,
smoking and grilling methods.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight turkeys and a dozen tryptophan-laced days later, we
have a winner that takes less time to cook than most standard
recipes and will make a perfect centerpiece to your Thanksgiving
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   In testing the methods, we looked for the best overall result,
best appearance, best skin, best taste and best texture. To keep
the test as reliable as possible, we used the same brand and size
of turkeys throughout _ Safeway Manor House frozen turkeys,
weighing an average of 12 pounds _ and roasted them straight from
the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   Our first step was determining what internal temperature was
best for ``doneness.'' We roasted several turkeys at 325 degrees
since most recipes call for that oven temperature. After tasting
birds cooked to an internal thigh temperature of 180 degrees
(turkey-jerky), 170 degrees (acceptable but better with gravy), 160
degrees (juicy white meat but softer, dark meat that was pinkish
near the thigh bone), we decided 165 degrees produced the best
overall white and dark meat. The juices ran clear and there were no
traces of pink near the bone.
</P>
<P>
   Most sources recommend cooking poultry to an internal thigh
temperature of 180-185 degrees, but U.S. Department of Agriculture
standards say 160-165 degrees will kill contaminants, including
salmonella. The temperature also continues to rise several degrees
when the turkey is allowed to rest the recommended 20-30 minutes
before carving. (A good way to double-check is that the meat should
not be pink and the juices should run clear.)
</P>
<P>
   The thigh usually takes longer to cook than the breast, as our
tests confirmed, so temperatures of the breast are generally higher
than the thigh.
</P>
<P>
   Once we found 165 degrees as the best internal temperature, we
looked at which roasting temperature would be the best way to get
there. We roasted turkeys at 350, 375 and 400 degrees, and took
each bird out of the oven when their thighs reached 165 degrees.
Although all were acceptable, one staffer summed up comments on the
400 degree bird: ``By far the best turkey (so far)! Loved the dark,
white and skin.'' A 12-pound bird will take 13/4 to 2 hours to
cook.
</P>
<P>
   The 400-degree oven temperature is fine on a turkey up to 16
pounds (which will take about 21/2 hours to cook). Larger turkeys
should be roasted at a lower temperature (see Big Bird section
below).
</P>
<P>
   The next breakthrough was discovering that varying the oven
temperatures from high to low or low to high or starting the bird
breast-side down didn't make the difference, and moister, juicier
white meat came at the expense of an evenly brown, crisp skin.
</P>
<P>
   Our next step was to maintain the 400 degrees oven temperature,
leave the turkey breast-side up the entire time, and try various
basting solutions to improve the bird.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Basting is Better &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Basting strictly with butter resulted in a wonderful, buttery,
evenly browned and crispy skin. Basting another turkey (No. 15)
with 1/2 cup stock to start and pan drippings after the foil was
removed was even better _ it helped deglaze the roasting pan and
gave this turkey great skin and a richer, complex flavor. This
became our new Best Way (and was repeated as No. 17).
</P>
<P>
   Then we tried stuffing the turkey and cooking it the same way.
But roasting it at 400 degrees until the thigh reached 165 degrees
turned the turkey into toast before the stuffing got to the
recommended safe temperature. For a stuffed turkey, it's best to go
with the standard lower roasting temperatures recommended in the
chart elsewhere in this section.
</P>
<P>
   Our last step to try improve our Best Way unstuffed bird was to
brine it before roasting. We eliminated salt from the basic
seasoning since the salty brine had already penetrated the meat.
This was a turbo-charged turkey that had Food department staffers
and visitors from other departments waxing poetic poultry prose and
planning their Thanksgiving turkeys.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; THE BEST WAY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Best Way to prepare a smaller turkey is to brine it before
cooking _ turkey No. 21. Brine it according to the accompanying
recipe for 12 to 24 hours, then rinse and dry it well. Spread 2
tablespoons of softened butter over the skin and sprinkle with 11/2
teaspoons of ground black pepper over the skin and in the cavity.
Tuck the wing tips under, tie the legs together, and place the
turkey breast up on a V-shaped roasting rack in a shallow roasting
pan. Cover the breast tightly with aluminum foil and place in an
oven preheated to 400 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Roast the turkey 50-60 minutes, then remove the foil and
immediately baste with 1/2 cup of turkey stock. The stock should
help deglaze the roasting pan and provide additional pan drippings.
Leave the foil off and baste with pan drippings every 20-30 minutes
until the internal thigh temperature reaches 165 degrees; a 12- to
16-pound turkey will cook in about 2-23/4 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Start checking the internal temperature after about 11/2 hours
of roasting time. If the legs begin to get too brown, cover loosely
with foil. Let the turkey rest at least 20 minutes before carving.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; AN APPEALING ALTERNATIVE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If you do not want to brine, roasting the turkey according to
the No. 17 method is the way to go. Sprinkle it with a mixture of
41/2 teaspoons of kosher salt and 11/2 teaspoons of ground black
pepper over the skin and in the cavity before roasting. Roasting
time for a 12- to 16-pound turkey is about 13/4-21/4 hours; a
16-pound turkey will take about 2-23/4 hours.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; THE BIG BIRD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Not every large family wants to cook two 12-pound turkeys so we
wanted to translate this Best Way method to a bigger bird. A
22-pound turkey that was cooked at 350 degrees with the breast
tightly covered with foil for the first half of cooking and then
basted with stock and pan drippings was wonderful. Remember to
cover the legs loosely with foil if they begin to get too brown.
Total roasting time is about 31/2 hours. Brining would have made it
even better.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; OTHER ALTERNATIVES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   We also tried deep-frying, grilling and smoking turkeys. Any of
these would free up the oven for cooking the rest of the holiday
meal, but they do require additional equipment and probably an
extra set of hands or two to prepare.
</P>
<P>
   Many people swear by the deep-frying method,  &LR; the &LR;  way to cook
turkey in Louisiana and other parts of the South (for more details
on deep-frying, see the story elsewhere in this section). A
deep-fried turkey with dry rub on the skin, under the breast skin
and in the cavity was quickly dubbed ``Chernobyl Bird'' for its
overly dark, inedible skin. However, the firm-textured meat was
surprisingly good.
</P>
<P>
   The deep-fried turkey that was first injected with a
butter-garlic-herb marinade and allowed to marinate for 12 hours
was better. The meat remained moist and juicy even though several
tasters described at as ``too rich'' and the marinade flavor too
predominant. The skin of this deep-fried turkey (No. 25) was
wonderfully brown and crisp without any greasy reminders of
deep-fried food.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Food staff said they preferred the traditional
turkey and would not go to the extra trouble and (equipment)
expense for a deep-fried fowl _ not to mention having to deal with
several gallons of very hot oil.
</P>
<P>
   Turkeys No. 26 and 27 were both brined before being grilled and
smoked. While the grilled turkey was fine, the one smoked over
indirect heat with soaked applewood chips added to the briquettes
was the hands-down winner. The skin was not as nice as the grilled
bird, but the flavorful, moist meat and mild smokiness more than
compensated. It took about 21/4-3 hours to cook.
</P>
<P>
   And even after tasting 28 turkeys most testers confided that
they were  &LR; not &LR;  tired of turkey, and were even looking forward to
preparing their own Thanksgiving turkey _ according to our Best Way
for cooking it to perfection.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Begin optional trim. &QL; 
 &QL; 
For those who are not yet on turkey-information overload, here are
some additional insights learned during our turkey adventures:
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Basting &LR; . Use the top portion of the pan drippings to baste.
It contains a larger proportion of fat and oil, which helps brown,
moisten and flavor the skin. Avoid the solid specks at the bottom
of the pan. These can darken more than the skin and even burn.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Brining &LR; . Variations on brine may be made by varying the
spices and herbs. If you don't want to brine the bird in your
refrigerator, use an ice chest. Place the turkey and brine into a
double-layer of garbage bags. Smoosh out all the air pockets, close
the bags up and pack in the chest with ice. The bird will happily _
and safely _ brine away. All that extra space freed up in the
refrigerator will make the cook happy, too.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Deep-Frying &LR; . Because of the mess and the danger of a grease
fire, deep-frying should be done outdoors. Another caveat: This
method requires an investment in special equipment.
</P>
<P>
   You'll need a high-BTU (over 100,000) propane burner with jet
flame, which will keep 4 to 5 gallons of cooking oil at 360
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Other items include: an aluminum pot (about 28 quarts) large
enough to hold the turkey and oil, a long-stem (12-inch)
deep-frying thermometer, a fire extinguisher and metal wire (we
used 16-gauge galvanized) to raise and lower the bird in the oil.
We also purchased an injector for the marinade and a vertical
poultry roaster to help with handling and draining the bird.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller birds are easiest to deep-fry. We fried our 11-pound
turkeys 3 minutes per pound.

</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Defrosting.  &LR; Don't wait until the last minute to defrost a
fully frozen turkey. Our hard-as-rock, 12-pound birds took longer
than package instructions indicated, both when defrosting in the
refrigerator and in cold water.
</P>
<P>
   Turkeys cook more evenly when fully defrosted, so take the extra
time and don't try the oven-defrosting method. On two earlier
attempts, we tried putting a turkey that was extra cold into the
oven. The first bird had to cook too long to reach 165 degrees,
which resulted in drier meat. The other bird, when carved, revealed
some residual pinkness at the thigh bone.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Equipment.  &LR; We used a V-shaped nonstick rack in a standard
18-inch oval enameled roasting pan. Our 12-pound turkey just fit
without hanging over the sides.
</P>
<P>
   A rectangular roasting pan would work well, too, but whatever
size pan you use, most of the turkey should be above the sides of
the pan to assure even cooking and browning.
</P>
<P>
   A big help in all the testing were the digital thermometers (see
What's New) with probes and the magnetic oven thermometers that
stuck to the inside wall of the oven, helping ensure the oven heat
matched the temperature selected on the control.
</P>
<P>
   Another must was the standard plastic bulb-baster for the
turkey.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; The Seasoning.  &LR; We kept the basic seasonsing simple: Two
tablespoons of softened unsalted butter rubbed on the skin,
followed by 41/2 teaspoons salt mixed with 11/2 teaspoons ground
black pepper (a 3 to 1 ratio).
</P>
<P>
   Even though this is more salt than is called for in many
recipes, we wanted to have a flavorful skin and great pan
drippings. The gravies made with the pan drippings did not require
any additional seasoning. The amount of salt may be reduced, if
desired. Adding celery, onions, fresh herbs, etc. to the cavity,
would provide moisture and flavor, especially to the pan drippings.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Taking the Temperature &LR; . It does take practice to hit the
spot in the thigh just right the first time. Aim for the fleshiest
part, just below the leg-thigh joint, and deep enough to probe the
middle of the thigh. Or, insert the thermometer into the thigh from
the breast. Whichever way you use, stay away from the bone, which
carries and holds the heat faster than the meat.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, test both thighs to make sure the turkey has cooked
evenly. Allow several seconds for the thermometer to fully
register. Rotating the pan while cooking the turkey will help it
cook evenly.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, you may want to calibrate your thermometer so you
are sure it is reading the temperature accurately. Place it in an
ice slush that is half ice, half cold water and deep enough to
cover about 2 inches of the thermometer. Temperature measurement
occurs where the ``dimple'' is on the stem. Since water freezes at
32 degrees, any difference in the actual thermometer reading should
be taken into account when taking the temperature of your turkey.
Alternately, an instant-read thermometer can be adjusted by turning
the small calibration nut at the back of the dial.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; GRAVY FROM BRINED PAN DRIPPINGS: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  Making gravy from the pan-drippings of brined and roasted turkey
takes extra care because the salty brine carries over into the
drippings. The heat from oven roasting also reduces the pan
drippings, increasing the saltiness even more.
</P>
<P>
   To successfully make gravy from a brined bird, strain the pan
drippings and defat them by putting the drippings in the freezer
after they have cooled. The fat will rise to the top and can be
lifted off.
</P>
<P>
   To thicken the gravy, make a roux with equal amounts of unsalted
butter and flour. Cook it over medium heat, stirring occasionally,
until the roux begins to look ``grainy,'' about 3-4 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Put turkey stock in a separate pan, and heat. Add a bit of roux
to the warm stock while whisking. Allow to come to a simmer to
thicken. Add more roux, whisking, until the gravy comes to desired
thickness.
</P>
<P>
   Taste the defatted pan drippings to determine the saltiness.
Then add a tablespoon at a time to the gravy to balance the
seasonings. Add herbs, wine or pepper to taste, if desired.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CHEZ PANISSE'S BRINE FOR TURKEY
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   21/2 gallons cold water
</P>
<P>
   2 cups kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 bay leaves, torn into pieces
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch fresh thyme, or 4 tablespoons dried
</P>
<P>
   1 whole head of garlic, cloves separated and peeled
</P>
<P>
   5 whole allspice berries, crushed
</P>
<P>
   4 juniper berries, smashed
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Place the water in a large pot that can easily hold the liquid
and the turkey you intend to brine. Add all ingredients and stir
for a minute or two until the sugar and salt dissolve.
</P>
<P>
   Put your turkey into the brine and refrigerate for 24 hours. If
the turkey floats to the top, use a plate or other weight to keep
it completely submerged in the brine.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Note: &LR;  The recipe may be halved or doubled; the important thing
is to have enough brine to completely cover the turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Before roasting, remove the bird from the brine and drain well.
Pat dry. Follow The Best Way instructions. &QL;

MIXING A COCKTAIL OF DISCONNECTED PARTYGOERS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 21) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 Bob Morris' most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was about the
playwright Christopher Durang.  
 By BOB MORRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was late last month, a week before the first
preview of the Broadway revue ``Putting It Together,'' a collection
of Stephen Sondheim songs, and Carol Burnett was still figuring out
how to tug Ruthie Henshall's earrings off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to pull your hair,'' said Ms. Burnett, who opens
in the show Sunday night with Ms. Henshall at the Ethel Barrymore
Theater. ``But if I pull your earlobes off, that's OK, I guess,
right?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Henshall, the young musical-comedy star who came over from
London last summer to play Velma Kelly in the musical ``Chicago,''
laughed. Ms. Burnett winked. Then the two actresses went back to
working out Bob Avian's on-the-verge-of-violence blocking for
``There's Always a Woman,'' a dueling-dames tour de force from the
musical ``Anyone Can Whistle.''
</P>
<P>
   On the attack in three-quarter time, they danced around while
flashing fake smiles at each other and enunciating invective
complex enough (especially when combined with the composer's
elaborate syncopation) to keep stopping them in their tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a woman, the counterfeit check,'' they sang in
counterpoint, ``the snake in the woodpile, the pain in the neck.''
Suddenly they came to a halt. ``This is so tricky,'' Ms. Burnett
confided to Eric D. Schaeffer, the director who worked with her on
the original production produced by Cameron Mackintosh at the Mark
Taper Forum in Los Angeles last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like you have to learn each line phonetically,'' added
Ms. Henshall. The number is just one of many tongue-twisting songs
in an evening set at an uptown dinner party filled with tension,
passion, separation and, ultimately, redemption.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of two hours, the host couple, played by Ms.
Burnett and George Hearn, watch their faltering marriage unravel
and realign itself, as the older man goes after the younger woman
(Ms. Henshall), who arrives on the arm of John Barrowman, while
Bronson Pinchot portrays the narrator.
</P>
<P>
   Putting across the psychological tinderbox-tone of this scenario
and the convoluted Sondheim lyrics (Ms. Burnett also tackles the
acid-tinged ``Ladies Who Lunch'' and the famously frenetic ``Not
Getting Married Today'' from ``Company'') requires precision,
perspicacity and perseverance.
</P>
<P>
   After their rehearsal, Ms. Henshall and Ms. Burnett (whose role
will be played by Kathie Lee Gifford on Tuesdays) took a break to
breathe, drink bottled water and talk in prose.
</P>
<P>
   BOB MORRIS. Art isn't easy, is it?
</P>
<P>
   CAROL BURNETT. It's not a walk in the park. But Sondheim never
is. The music is hard to learn and attention must be paid to his
lyrics. He's always surprising you.
</P>
<P>
   RUTHIE HENSHALL. Carol, I'm just amazed. How do you deal with
``Not Getting Married Today''?
</P>
<P>
   BURNETT. I sing it slower than most. I want audiences to
understand the words. If you sing too fast, they can't.
</P>
<P>
   HENSHALL. It sounds pretty fast to me.
</P>
<P>
   BURNETT. When Julie Andrews did this show in 1993, she told me
she rehearsed the number with a pencil in her mouth. I told her I'd
try it. I never did. Maybe I should call her and ask what she
meant. I mean, where would you put the pencil? Under your nose?
Between your teeth?
</P>
<P>
   MORRIS. Sondheim tends to depict parties as arenas for social
warfare. And there is a good deal of forced civility in this show.
Can you relate to that off the stage?
</P>
<P>
   HENSHALL. I'm not a party person, if that's what you mean. And
as I get older I get worse at surface talk. It's a problem because
so much networking in New York is done at parties, at least that's
what I'm told. If that's really so, I'm going to be out of work
soon.
</P>
<P>
   MORRIS. Clive Barnes once described Sondheim's characters as
people you'd go out of your way to avoid at a cocktail party. Is it
hard playing such unhappy archetypes?
</P>
<P>
   BURNETT. After you strip away the layers to these characters,
you realize they're as decent as the rest of us, and they're all
looking for the same things we are _ love and happiness.
</P>
<P>
   HENSHALL. John and I play this couple at the beginning stages of
a relationship, when it's romantic and passionate, and you don't
have to work hard at it at all.
</P>
<P>
   BURNETT. That never lasts, does it?
</P>
<P>
   HENSHALL. No, it doesn't. When you really love somebody, you
have to work at the bumps you come up against.
</P>
<P>
   BURNETT. You mean mountains.
</P>
<P>
   HENSHALL. My character finds it hard watching an older couple
and seeing what a marriage can become. George sings this
heartbreaking ``Follies'' song, ``The Road You Didn't Take,'' which
is about the regret you have later in life. It's very touching. In
a show like this, you really connect to your emotions.
</P>
<P>
   BURNETT. This is what Sondheim's about _ relationships and
getting through life. But it's not all darkness, either. There are
laughs, too. And opportunities to be bitchy in a very funny kind of
way. You can really get your feelings out in this show.
</P>
<P>
   HENSHALL. It's marvelous to be an actress and get paid to do
that.
</P>
<P>
   BURNETT. In ``Could I Leave You?'' I get to do a lot of
screaming. It feels like doing the Tarzan yell on my old television
show. I feel totally purged when I walk off the stage, so when I
get home I don't feel like kicking the cat. Not that I'd ever
actually kick my cat.
</P>
<P>
   HENSHALL. Of course not, Carol.

THINNING SEA ICE STOKES DEBATE ON CLIMATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By WILLIAM K. STEVENS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The great ice cover that stretches across the top of the globe
has become about 40 percent thinner than it was two to four decades
ago, scientists have found after analyzing data collected by
nuclear submarines plying the Arctic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Since the ice is already floating in the water, no rise in sea
level has accompanied its melting, as happens when land-based
glaciers shrink. But the finding raises anew the question of
whether climatic changes observed in recent decades are the result
of the atmosphere's natural behavior, or a global warming caused by
human activity, or some combination of the two.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists found in a new study that over the period 1958
through 1976, the average thickness of the Arctic sea ice was about
10 feet. Over the period 1993 through 1997, it was about six feet.
In the 1990s, according to the researchers, the thinning appeared
to be continuing at a rate of about four inches a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a startling result,'' said Dr. D.A. Rothrock, an
oceanographer at the University of Washington in Seattle who is the
leader of the study, which is being published in the December issue
of the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
</P>
<P>
   The research involved measurements of sea ice thickness made by
upward-looking sonar aboard naval submarines operating under the
ice sheet. The first period of data began in 1958 with the first
nuclear submarine, the USS Nautilus, and concluded with a cruise by
HMS Sovereign in 1976. The second data set was collected by
American vessels from 1993 through 1997. Rothrock and two
colleagues, Y. Yu and G.A. Maykut of the University of Washington,
compared data from the two periods at 29 points where the courses
of submarines in the 1990s intersected with the courses of those in
the earlier period.
</P>
<P>
   Substantial evidence has emerged that the climate of the Arctic
and sub-Arctic region is warming, at least in some seasons. The
area covered by sea ice has diminished and the duration of the
cover has shortened in many places. Mountain glaciers in Alaska
have shrunk, as has the Greenland ice cap.
</P>
<P>
   The average surface temperature of the earth has risen by about
1 degree Fahrenheit or a little more over the last century, and by
several times that amount in northern regions. Mainstream
scientists expect that the global average will rise by about
another 3.5 degrees by the year 2100 if emissions of heat-trapping
waste industrial gases like carbon dioxide continue at present
levels. By comparison, the earth's surface temperature has risen by
5 to 9 degrees since the depths of the last ice age, 18,000 to
20,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Rothrock believes that a shift in prevailing natural patterns of
atmospheric circulation in the Arctic may be responsible for the
warmer North and the thinning sea ice. Other scientists say that
the shift in natural patterns may have been touched off or enhanced
by global warming, and Rothrock agrees that it is possible a
warming climate could be related in some way.
</P>
<P>
   The key is a seesaw sort of winter circulation pattern in which
prevailing westerly winds in the Arctic, sub-Arctic and North
Atlantic vary between two basic states, one stronger and one
weaker. In this Arctic oscillation, as it is called, one pattern or
another has been dominant for decades at a time before switching to
the opposite mode.
</P>
<P>
   In one mode, which has been dominant since about the mid-1970s,
stronger westerly winds blow surface water away from the Arctic and
toward the southeast. This, said Rothrock, could carry cold surface
water away from the Arctic, bearing chunks of sea ice with it.
Other observations have established this.
</P>
<P>
   As the chunks depart, areas of open water enlarge, presenting
more ice edges to melt should a source of warming appear. One
source, said Dr. Drew Shindell, an atmospheric physicist at the
NASA Goddard Center for Space Studies in New York City, is warm,
deep water that flows upward to replace the departing surface water
that has been chilled by the winter. In addition, said Rothrock,
the stronger winds may also bring warmer air to the Arctic,
furthering the melting.
</P>
<P>
   Computer modeling studies, said Shindell, indicate that the
present situation is ``not a natural thing.'' According to the
models, the buildup of heat-trapping greenhouse gases is largely
responsible. The reason, he said, is apparently that one effect of
global warming is to increase the temperature contrast between the
tropics and polar regions at critical altitudes, thereby
strengthening the westerly winds. He suggests that this pattern
will prevail for the next 30 or 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the present state will persist or the Arctic oscillation
will swing back to its alternate condition is going to be
``extremely interesting,'' Rothrock said.

   PARIS _ The world economy is growing at an unexpectedly fast
pace because of surprisingly strong expansion in Japan and South
Korea, a more modest upturn in Europe and economic resilience in
the United States, an organization of the world's richest nations
said Tuesday in a semiannual appraisal.
</P>
<P>
   The group, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development, which helps coordinate policy among the affluent
nations, said it expected the global growth rate to reach 3.5
percent next year. Its assessment in May had forecast growth in
2000 of 2.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outlook for world and OECD-wide output growth has improved
substantially over the past few months,'' the organization said.
</P>
<P>
   Its report suggested that Japan's economic recovery in
particular had been more vigorous than anticipated. The
organization's earlier assessment projected that Japan would
continue to struggle next year against recession, its worst since
the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``These changes reflect mainly unexpected near-term momentum in
the United States economy, a stronger and more rapid resumption of
growth in Japan and, particularly, South Korea, as well as a
slightly better outlook for the European Union,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Europe, it said, is showing signs of expansion and in 2000 and
2001 is expected to grow 2.8 percent in the 11-nation euro currency
zone. In its last report, the OECD predicted euro zone growth next
year of 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The report also suggested that European countries would make
progress against high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   It forecast 3.1 percent growth for the United States next year,
after predicting last spring that the American economy faced a
natural slowdown and 2 percent growth after eight years of
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   And it said that Japan, the world's second-largest economy, had
emerged from recession faster than expected, but that in the long
term it faced risks from the continued appreciation of the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese currency's strength this year has already hurt
profit at many big-name corporations that derive much of their
business from exports, like Sony, Toyota and Hitachi. The yen's
rise partly reflects the increased prospect of higher interest
rates in Japan because of the heavy borrowing that the government
must undertake to stimulate growth through spending.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Japanese government announced a new package of
economic stimulants worth about $171 billion, almost twice the
amount that had been expected a few weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-member OECD, founded in 1960, was originally made up of
nations in Europe and North America. It expanded to include Japan,
Australia, New Zealand and Finland. More recently, Mexico, the
Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and South Korea have joined.

 &HT;    E-Texas to study state services
 &HT;    By Erik Rodriguez
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The chore of waiting in line to renew a driver's
license or motor vehicle registration could be a thing of the past
in Texas, courtesy of a plan introduced by Comptroller Carole
Keeton Rylander Tuesday that would integrate government commerce
with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The plan's ultimate goal is to offer recommendations that would
eliminate obstacles and lower costs for services the state
provides. For Texans, it would mean being able to perform many
government-related transactions, including license renewal, sales
tax payments and permit applications, over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Rylander, who is serving her first year as comptroller, said the
project evolved out of work performed in her office. ``It really
hit home with my staff when they showed me how much paper we were
using for some taxpayers to report that they owed no taxes,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rylander unveiled e-Texas, a commission that will oversee 14
separate task forces that will explore ways to streamline state
government.
</P>
<P>
   Project officials said the initiative is overdue and would allow
the state to keep up with advancing technology. ``Government by its
very nature doesn't have competitive pressures (like) other
businesses competing to tell you when to change,'' said Wendy
Gramm, co-chairman of the e-Texas commission and wife of U.S. Sen.
Phil Gramm, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Officials could not put a specific price tag on the venture or
identify how much money could be saved, but Rylander said the
funding would come from a mixture of public and private funds. The
comptroller's office has a $9 million research budget.
</P>
<P>
   The new project will be considered a joint effort with the Texas
Performance Review, one of the hallmarks of the tenure of former
Comptrollers John Sharp and Bob Bullock. Although most functions of
the new commission will be relegated to offering suggestions in the
next legislative session, Rylander said other proposals, such as
the license-renewal plan, could be implemented much sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The task force will get busy on that immediately,'' she said.
``That's something that we have the authority to do; we just need
to use the technology to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The project is similar to one Rylander had proposed in the
Citizen's Waste Fighting Commission while on the campaign trail
last year. E-Texas' 14 committees will review specific functions of
Texas government and offer suggestions for improvement.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Rylander created a task force to investigate
public schools _ a move that, as the state's chief tax officer,
went beyond the scope of any comptroller before her.
</P>
<P>
   Rylander disagreed with speculation that e-Texas' oversight
committees would overstep her boundaries as comptroller, asserting
that the project is one built out of necessity and not a
re-creation of the Texas Performance Review.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see it as overlap or duplication,'' Rylander said. ``I
see it clearly as my responsibility and my authority to make sure
dollars are being used effectively and efficiently in this state.''

MARKET PLACE: EXPLAINING THE INVESTOR EUPHORIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also FED-RATES) 
(mk) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Interest rates may rise, the Federal Reserve Board
may fret, but there's just no keeping a good bull market down.
</P>
<P>
   Voicing concerns that the economy is too darn hot and employment
is way too tight, the Federal Reserve Board on Tuesday raised
short-term interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point. Stock
investors generally dislike interest rate increases because, in the
broadest sense, they raise the cost of operating a business. Rising
rates also make bonds more attractive than stocks as investments.
</P>
<P>
   So it was not too surprising that the Fed's rate increase
spooked stocks after it was announced. A quick blip upward could
not be sustained, and the Dow Jones industrials fell about 140
points on the news.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, stock traders got their bearings and roared with
approval over the move. The white-hot NASDAQ composite index gained
73.51 points on the day, a 2.28 percent increase. The Dow Jones
industrial average raced ahead 171.58 points, or 1.59 percent. At
the end of the trading day, the Dow stood at 10,932.33, just 3.8
percent below its high reached last August.
</P>
<P>
   The investor euphoria following the Fed's action seemed to be
based on two assumptions. Most compelling was the view that the
Fed's action was the last rate increase for the foreseeable future.
The next meeting of the Fed's Open Market Committee takes place on
Dec. 21, an unlikely occasion for anyone except Ebenezer Scrooge to
raise rates. The meeting after that, in early February, is expected
to feature economic statistics distorted by year 2000 anomalies. As
a result, many economists have concluded that the Fed will not move
again on rates until next spring regardless of what the economic
data say.
</P>
<P>
   Stock investors also liked Tuesday's decision by the Fed to
shift into neutral on any future moves. Before the meeting, the Fed
had assumed a stance that favored tightening.
</P>
<P>
   The increase Tuesday in the federal funds rate, the Fed's third
increase since June, raises the overnight rate charged by banks
lending excess funds to one another. The Fed also raised the rate
at which banks can borrow from the central bank, called the
discount rate, to 5 percent, a quarter-point move. Some banks
responded by raising the prime rate, a benchmark for what they
charge some of their best customers, with others likely to follow.
</P>
<P>
   But even as stock investors celebrated, bond investors took up
their worry beads. Bond prices fell, pushing up the yield on the
30-year U.S. Treasury bond to 6.06 percent on Tuesday, from 6.024
percent on Monday. Bond investors chose to read the Fed's statement
that accompanied the rate rises as a warning that further rate
increases will follow if the economy does not start to cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to see growth slow down to insure that this is in fact
going to be the last tightening move,'' said Stephen Slifer, chief
U.S. economist at Lehman Brothers. Slifer pointed out that recent
hints of a slowdown, flattening retail sales and a decline in the
housing sector had to be echoed in other data for the Fed to relax
on rates. ``If this turns out to be another fakeout and growth
continues to be 4 to 5 percent,'' Slifer said, ``the Fed will be
back.''
</P>
<P>
   In its comments, the Fed gave clues to what economic data it
will be watching most closely in coming weeks to help it decide
where to go on interest rates. A prime cause for alarm is the low
unemployment rate, the central bank said. With unemployment falling
to a 29-year low of 4.1 percent last month, many fear that the
United States is running out of employable workers. Such low
unemployment cannot continue indefinitely without leading to higher
labor costs and rising inflation.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, overall economic growth is running well ahead of
the rate the Fed would prefer to see. The initial estimate on gross
domestic product growth in the third quarter is an increase of 4.8
percent; economists say this figure may be revised up to 5.5
percent. Either number is far above the Fed's target growth rate of
3 percent or even 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Fed's statement made no mention of elevated stock
prices and the ensuing ``wealth effect'' from investors who feel
freer to spend, Greenspan has telegraphed to investors that rising
stock prices have become a factor in his decisions on rates. In a
speech before the Business Council on Oct. 28, Greenspan alluded to
the wealth effect when he remarked upon the ``expanding net worth
of households relative to income.'' If the nation's households are
seeing their net worths rising faster than their incomes, much of
this is driven by stocks.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the strong rally seen in stocks on Tuesday may have
the unintended consequence of increasing the likelihood of future
rate boosts. This is also a risk because a rising stock market
translates very closely to increased retail sales and other
measures of economic strength.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   According to International Strategy and Investment, an
investment advisory firm, the stock market and Christmas sales are
inextricably linked. Last year, for example, the market was up 17
percent in the fourth quarter from the third quarter, and retail
sales grew at a strong 11 percent rate from the previous quarter.
Conversely, in 1997, the stock market rose 3 percent in the fourth
quarter, and retail sales moved up at exactly the same rate.
</P>
<P>
   Slifer agreed that the stock market acts as a great force on the
economy. ``If the stock boys keep revving it up here and stock
prices go up again,'' he said, ``then budding signs of a slowdown
will disappear and GDP growth will continue.'' Another rate
increase would probably follow.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's focus on the domestic economy in its statement, and
the absence of any mention of the international economic situation,
is also revealing. The message, said William Dudley, chief U.S.
economist at Goldman, Sachs, is that the Fed is far from finished
with raising rates. ``I think it's telling you that they're going
to keep tightening as long as the economy is too strong,'' Dudley
said. ``If the economy keeps going along at this pace, the Fed is
going to have to do more.''
</P>
<P>
   Dudley added that the Fed said that its action Tuesday ``should
markedly diminish the risk of inflation going forward.'' But
investors who see a sign of no further rate increases should recall
that the same statement was made the last time the Fed raised
rates, in August.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the stock market seemed to welcome Tuesday's action
by the Fed as its final move for a while, additional economic data
could quickly change the picture. Wednesday's announcement of the
Consumer Price Index for October is expected to show an increase of
.2 percent from October 1998. If the number checks in much higher
than that, all bets are off, traders say.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Late last Friday evening in Beijing, an angry and
frustrated Charlene Barshefsky declared to the Chinese on other
side of the negotiating table, ``You are wasting my time.'' Then
she pulled out the oldest pressure tactic in a negotiator's bag of
tricks: She demanded to see the country's prime minister, Zhu
Rongji, and declared that the next morning she would head for
airport.
</P>
<P>
   It worked. At 3:10 a.m. Saturday, Barshefsky's team was awakened
by a call inviting her to Zhongnanhai, the walled, lakeside complex
next to the Forbidden City where China's top leaders live and work.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later they were escorted in to see the 71-year old
Zhu, the champion of Chinese economic reform who U.S. intelligence
agencies had concluded was quickly losing power after a failed
meeting on trade in April with President Clinton in Washington. He
volunteered that China's leaders had met until 2 a.m. to decide how
high a price they were willing to pay for entry into the World
Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' said Zhu, according to Barshefsky, the U.S. trade
representative, and other American participants in the week of
high-tension negotiations, ``I am going to tell you what we can do,
and what we can't do.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty-eight hours later _ after two more threats by Barshefsky
to leave town and another critical intervention by Zhu _ the
world's most populous nation and its most powerful nation closed a
deal that leaders of both countries needed, for very different
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   What was at stake for Zhu and for President Jiang Zemin was the
future of their own effort to complete one of the most astounding
economic reform programs in history while preserving the Communist
Party's absolute political control. Only by allowing in foreign
competition, Zhu has long argued, will China's giant, inefficient
industries be whipped into shape and prepared to compete around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton, a deal would mean he could leave office claiming to
have taken the biggest single step toward integrating China with
the West _ admitting it to the club of capitalist economies, and
winning its agreement to live under the rule of international law.
</P>
<P>
   Barshefsky knew what she had to deliver. ``It's the legacy
thing,'' she told friends at a birthday party for her husband in
Washington a few days before she left for Beijing. For the
president, she said, ``there's nothing bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   The winding road the two countries took to Monday's
groundbreaking agreement was strewn with obstacles. There were
cultural miscues, furious arguments within the White House, a
divided leadership in Beijing, a bombed Chinese embassy in
Belgrade, and constant political calculations about how the AFL-CIO
and dispirited Chinese steel workers might react.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Clinton paid a price: China backed away from its
April offer to allow American telecommunications companies and
insurance firms to take a 51 percent stake in Chinese companies,
allowing only a noncontrolling stake of 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The give and take had all the ingredients of any modern trade
negotiations between great powers: secret phone calls between
presidents, the constant tension between geo-strategy and domestic
politics and an endgame that turned into a weeklong game of
chicken.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing it worked,'' said Gene Sperling, Clinton's
national economic adviser, who was against a deal in April, and for
it once his boss made it clear that the April rejection was a huge
mistake. But the hard work may be just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Once China makes it into the World Trade Organization _ months
of work are still ahead _ Sperling and others expect a long, hard
slog as China's domestic interests try to undo on the ground what
negotiators just signed on the table.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the strangest aspect of these talks is that China was a
founding member of the very organization it just spent 13 years
negotiating to re-enter.
</P>
<P>
   Though a civil war was under way in China, the Nationalist
government was among the first to ratify the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade in 1948. After the Nationalists fled the mainland
for Taiwan the next year, and Mao Tse-tung created the People's
Republic of China, it was unclear which China inherited the seat.
Taiwan held it for a year, then withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1980s, as Deng Xiaoping began China's rapid march to
a market economy, China's leadership realized that it needed to
re-enter the club. It was a matter of national prestige. But it was
also a hard-headed issue of economic advantage. As long as China
remained outside the treaty, countries were free to place high
tariffs on Chinese-made goods _ or to to block their entry
unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
   The talks began in July 1986, and a deal seemed within reach
three years later _ until the the student protests in Tiananmen
Square were crushed. Everything froze.
</P>
<P>
   There were a few signs of progress after Clinton's election in
1992, but he was focused on the passage of the North American Free
Trade Agreement, then the Senate battle to ratify a new accord that
created the World Trade Organization, the earlier agreement's
successor, as a truly powerful enforcer of world trading rules.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, China's enthusiasm for opening its economy waxed and
waned.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until Clinton and Jiang began exchanging state visits
two years ago that the talks became serious. And then the magnitude
of what China would have to do _ open its telecommunications
market, allow the distribution of American movies, dramatically
lower protections for its car industry, let American insurance
companies sell policies around the country _ seemed more than the
Chinese leadership could bear.
</P>
<P>
   By April, though, Zhu was ready to deal. He came to Washington
determined to seize the moment and cut a deal. He carried with him
some breathtaking proposals: American firms could take up to 51
percent of Chinese telecommunications companies and insurance firms
_ two strategic industries for China. Detroit's automakers could
have full access to China within 5 years, with low tariffs. U.S.
negotiators were astounded.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The problem was that Bill Clinton was not ready.
</P>
<P>
   Washington was awash in charges that China had stolen nuclear
secrets. Clinton was still recovering from the allegations _ never
proven _ that the Chinese government secretly contributed to
Democratic campaigns. Moreover, Zhu's offer was missing an
agreement that the United States could continue to act unilaterally
if China ``dumped'' steel or other products selling them below cost
to gain a U.S. market share. It was a huge issue for the American
labor movement.
</P>
<P>
   The day Zhu was arriving, Clinton gave a speech warning that
America should fear an economically weak China, not a militarily
strong one. Many took that as a sign that he was ready for a trade
deal. But his advisers were deeply divided.
</P>
<P>
   Barshefsky, National Security Adviser Sandy Berger and Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright all favored the deal. Sperling, White
House Chief of Staff John Podesta and political aides who focus on
domestic issues were against it. And so was the biggest heavyweight
in the administration, the Treasury secretary at that time, Robert
Rubin. ``We judged it couldn't pass in Congress,'' he said. ``And
that would be a bigger embarrassment for the Chinese.''
</P>
<P>
   When Zhu arrived, Clinton invited him for a nighttime talk in
the White House family quarters. It was a meeting full of miscues.
Clinton said he could make a deal _ but it would be politically
hard for him, and could be politically difficult for Zhu.
</P>
<P>
   It would be better, he said, to announce ``major progress.'' The
prime minister was confused, but did not insist. And so the visit
stumbled on, with Clinton ``only half focusing on it,'' said one
participant.
</P>
<P>
   Then the White House published a 14-page list of Zhu's
``concessions'' _ which many of China's industrial and political
leaders had not seen. They were outraged at what was being given
away. So were American executives, but for different reasons. At a
meeting at the White House the next week, they cheered Barshefsky _
and screamed at Sperling. Clinton had an explosion of his own over
the breakdown. ``I've rarely seen him as angry as he was after Zhu
left town,'' said one.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called Zhu, who by that time was in New York, and asked
him to restart talks. But Zhu said he could not do so until he got
back to Beijing. And as soon as he returned, he was under attack
there.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks later, the CIA delivered an analysis to the White House
declaring that Zhu had been politically undercut by the failed
trip, and that his political enemies were using the list of trade
concessions to bury his economic reform program. Berger later told
a colleague that the April meeting was ``one of the biggest foreign
policy mistakes of the second term.''
</P>
<P>
   It might have been fixable, but the bomb that blew up the
Chinese embassy in Belgrade in early May also blew up the talks.
The wave of nationalism that followed left China's leaders in no
position to make concessions.
</P>
<P>
   In late August, Clinton wrote Jiang a letter, hand-delivered by
Sen. Diane Feinstein, D-Calif. He asked to get the talks started
again at an Asian summit meeting in New Zealand. But the meeting
was a dud. ``The president kept saying, `All our negotiators are
here, let's get going,''' recalled one White House official. ``And
Jiang would nod, say something noncommittal, and nothing would
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton kept pushing. On Oct. 16, he called Jiang and said he
would soon send a ``bottom line'' offer and would follow it up _ if
Jiang wanted _ with a visit by Barshefsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jiang's response was not very revealing,'' said one silent
participant allowed to listen in to the call. ``But we thought that
there was a serious division in the Chinese leadership, and the
only way to resolve it was to force the issue.'' The hope was that
China would decide it wanted to be a a major player at the opening
of global trade talks in Seattle in late November.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a downside. In April, China was the supplicant,
looking for the deal. Now Clinton looked like he wanted it more
than Beijing did. ``It's never good to look too eager,'' warned
Barshefsky.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 8, Clinton called again, wondering if Jiang had read the
U.S. offer. He had, Jiang responded, sounding interested but
noncommittal. Barshefsky, he said, should come to Beijing. But
Clinton ended with a caution: ``I don't want to send Charlene to
fail.''
</P>
<P>
   Barshefsky brought political protection with her: Sperling, who
came to assure the Chinese that the once-divided White House now
wanted the deal _ but that there were some political concessions
Clinton could not live without.
</P>
<P>
   Once the talks began, Barshefsky and Sperling realized the
Chinese side was treading water. ``They clearly didn't have
instructions from the top,'' Sperling said. The deal they offered
was far less than what Clinton turned down in April. After three
days, Sperling, taking a prearranged cue from Barshefsky, blew his
top. Soon after that, Barshefsky did her take-me-to-your-leader
routine.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu offered the Americans the right to buy up to 49 percent of
telecommunications firms, and extend protections against Chinese
import surges for 10 years after the agreement takes effect. But he
said there were political limits to what he could do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Control of information was clearly their sensitive point,''
Sperling said. ``The whole idea of letting foreigners take 51
percent control of the telecommunications network _ Zhu made it
clear he couldn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   He sent the negotiators back to the table. But by Sunday night,
lower-level Chinese officials were clearly fighting a rear-guard
action, raising anew issues that the Americans thought were long
settled. On Sunday night, Barshefsky called Clinton to report that
the talks were ``in a downward cycle'' and that she planned to
leave Monday morning unless there was a sudden break.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, she recalls, said, ``If you can't break the cycle, come
home.'' But clearly he was disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, back in the negotiating rooms in the Ministry
of Foreign Trade, things looked worse. Then, Sperling and
Barshefsky were told that Zhu _ who does not make a habit of
visiting drab Chinese ministry buildings _ wanted to see them
upstairs. There, he talked about the political pressures on China.
Barshefsky leaned over and wrote on Sperling's legal pad, ``This is
like a Seinfeld episode.''
</P>
<P>
   But after a few minutes, Zhu made the concessions necessary for
the Americans to claim they got a respectable deal: foreigners
could take up to 50 percent of telecommunications firms, and the
United States could continue invoking its anti-dumping laws against
Chinese imports for up to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Relieved, the two Americans decided to take the deal. But first,
they needed a private place where they could place a call to
Clinton. There was only one: the women's bathroom. ``It wouldn't
have been so bad,'' said Barshefsky. ``Except that Gene wanders
around a lot when he's talking on a cell phone.''

45,000 NAZI-ERA SWISS BANK ACCOUNTS FOUND, COMMISSION REPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (mcd)  
 By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ A commission that is seeking Holocaust-era accounts in
Swiss banks has found nearly 45,000 accounts in addition to the
5,570 already published, said a person who has read a draft of the
group's report.
</P>
<P>
   Expected to be released in a few weeks, the report is being
prepared by the panel, headed by the former Federal Reserve
chairman, Paul A. Volcker. The group met on Monday in Zurich to
review the draft.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which has been three years in the making, is not
widely expected to recommend payments in addition to the $1.25
billion for Holocaust victims and their heirs that two major Swiss
banks agreed to in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Whether some or all the additional 45,000 accounts will be made
public and what language will be used to describe the bankers'
handling of the accounts have been sticking points in trying to
arrive at the final report. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Underlying those questions has been the bankers' fear that in
the face of the considerable number of accounts, the commission
might recommend additional sums to settle claims that Swiss banks
hoarded money belonging to Jews who died in the Holocaust and
profited from dealings with Nazi Germany. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In August, two high-level Swiss bankers and the president of the
Association of Swiss Banks sent a letter to Volcker and his aide,
Michael Bradfield, expressing that concern. The settlement,
separate from the Volcker panel, is generally viewed here as bowing
to threats to boycott Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
   When news of the banks' role in World War II began emerging, the
banks said they had just 755 accounts that could be linked to World
War II-era victims. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some 500 auditors scoured hundreds of Swiss banks looking for
accounts established from 1933 to 1945. The four auditing groups of
the commission have checked millions of names for possible links to
accounts and turned up 44,747 accounts with such links and an
additional 1,934 that appear to belong to senior Nazi officials or
Nazi collaborators. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The information in each account's records varies from just the
name of the account holder to complete written transactions over a
period of years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The World Jewish Congress, which has been pushing for full
disclosure of Switzerland's wartime activities, wants information
on all accounts to be public to help survivors and heirs to reclaim
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to have all accounts published,'' the secretary
general of the congress, Israel Singer, said. ``But we are, of
course, concerned that if we unleash a wave of interest that we
also do justice. This has to be weighed.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the bankers' association, James Nason, said:
``Our position is that banks have seen the individual audits and
basically accept them. We hope the final report accurately reflects
the findings of the individual audits.''

CASES OF PILOT SUICIDE ARE RARE, BUT NOT UNKNOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (With AIRCRASH) 
(sw) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is extremely rare for an airline pilot to crash a plane
deliberately. But it has happened.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1997, a SilkAir Boeing 737 was cruising at 35,000
feet in clear weather over Indonesia when it suddenly went into a
steep dive and crashed into a river, killing all 104 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Though a definitive finding has yet to be released by Indonesian
authorities, investigators believe that Tsu Way Ming, the jet's
captain, disconnected the cockpit voice recorder and flight data
recorder to mask his actions and then forced the plane into a dive.
Tsu had recently been demoted and disciplined by the airline and
had large gambling debts.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also believe that the crash of an Air Morocco
commuter airplane in 1994 that killed 51 people was a deliberate
act by the pilot. And the co-pilot of a Japan Airlines DC-8 that
crashed in Tokyo Bay in 1982, killing 24, was subsequently
institutionalized.
</P>
<P>
   Airline executives and representatives of pilots unions said on
Tuesday that the current battery of medical and flying requirements
that airline pilots must meet are good enough to weed out those who
might be mentally unstable. But some critics countered that
relatively little is being done by airlines and aviation
authorities to screen pilots for psychological distress.
</P>
<P>
   About half the major airlines give pilots a psychological test
as part of the hiring process, but few if any ever follow up, said
Dr. Robert Pressman, a clinical psychologist with Strategic
Outcomes, a company in Providence, R.I., that specializes in
selecting personnel for sensitive professions like flying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is doing ongoing screening right now to my knowledge,''
he said. ``It's scary.''
</P>
<P>
   To fly a commercial jet in the United States, a pilot must get a
medical checkup every six months from a doctor approved by the
Federal Aviation Administration. Though the examination is designed
mostly to ensure that the pilot is physically fit, the aviation
agency said that the doctors are also trained to discern whether a
pilot might be under psychological stress or depressed.
</P>
<P>
   The complementary standard set by the International Civil
Aviation Organization for its 185 member countries requires a
medical checkup every 12 months. The authorities have yet to prove
that suicide was the cause of the EgyptAir crash on Oct. 31, but
Egypt, as a member of the international organization, has agreed to
meet that minimum standard, although its civil aviation authority,
like the FAA, could require more frequent checkups.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots in the United States are also required to have their
flying skills evaluated by a pilot instructor on a simulator at
least once a year. And they are subject to surprise checks by FAA
inspectors and random drug tests by their employers. In addition,
the aviation agency says that it keeps a record of all pilots'
driver's licenses, which the agency compares to a national registry
of people arrested for drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
   Some airlines go further than the agency rules. United Airlines,
for example, the world's largest airline, requires pilots to
undergo an annual company physical that includes questions about
their personal lives. Both American Airlines and Delta Air Lines,
the nation's second and third-largest carriers, declined to comment
on their policies.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots' unions oppose the expansion of psychological testing
because they say the current tests are unreliable and the problem
is extremely rare.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the various requirements, individual pilots are able
to hide problems like drug abuse and alcoholism that would bar them
from flying. One pilot at a major airline continued to fly, even
though he had had his driver's license revoked for drunken driving
and had been arrested for beating his girlfriend while he was
drunk.

TRIAL ON 1996 VALUJET CRASH OPENS IN MIAMI 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ One thing became clear Tuesday, as federal prosecutors
and defense lawyers made opening statements in a criminal trial
that accuses a maintenance company and two employees of shoddy work
and an ensuing cover-up in the handling of explosive oxygen
generators implicated in the crash of Valujet Flight 592.
</P>
<P>
   No matter whom the jury ultimately believes, the 110 people who
departed Miami International Airport on that flight of May 11,
1996, were doomed as they took their seats.
</P>
<P>
   Either they died from criminal negligence, in the handling and
packaging of the explosive oxygen generators, as prosecutors
claimed, or they died from problems with the plane itself, a
27-year-old aircraft with faulty mechanics and wiring that should
never have been in the sky in the first place, as defense lawyers
argued.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 592 crashed into the Florida Everglades just after
takeoff, killing all aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors say Sabretech, a now-bankrupt aircraft
maintenance company, and two employees _ a former head mechanic and
a subcontractor doing mechanic work _ disregarded safety to rush
through their work on the oxygen generators, which prosecutors said
caught fire in a cargo hold and caused the plane to crash. The
company and the two workers are charged with causing the transport
of hazardous materials, falsifying documents and conspiring to lie
to federal investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Caroline Heck Miller said in her opening
statement that the generators, which provide emergency oxygen when
planes lose cabin pressure, were loaded into the plane's cargo hold
for transport to Atlanta without being fitted with safety caps.
</P>
<P>
   The missing caps were sacrificed for expediency, prosecutors
will try to prove.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emphasis was on getting the paperwork done, as opposed to
the task,'' Ms. Heck Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   But defense lawyers described a much different company, one in
which no one intentionally neglected safety procedures with intent
to cause a crash. But even they conceded that the maintenance
workers did not know how to handle the generators.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one at Sabretech intended for that plane to crash,'' said
Martin Raskin, a lawyer for Sabretech, which did maintenance for
Valujet.
</P>
<P>
   But Raskin did not paint a safety-inspiring picture of the
handling of the generators. While maintenance workers had neglected
to put the safety caps on the generators, they carefully packaged
them in cardboard boxes and wrapped them with bubble wrap, he said
in his opening statement.
</P>
<P>
   The generators, when triggered, can reach temperatures of 400 to
500 degrees, according to crash investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The generators were not labeled as hazardous, Raskin said. ``A
bottle of bleach,'' he said, ``will tell you more about its
dangers.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is the ensuing cover-up, federal prosecutors said, that
proves the mechanics knew they were putting people at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the caps were not installed, Eugene Florence, a
mechanic for Sabretech, signed a maintenance record saying they had
been. He is on trial here, along with his supervisor, Daniel
Gonzalez, the head mechanic and chief of hangar operations.
</P>
<P>
   A third Sabretech employee, Mauro Valenzuela, was also charged,
but is a fugitive from justice.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, the defendants could be imprisoned for up to 55
years and fined more than $2 million. Sabretech, which went out of
business after the crash, could be fined up to $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company has also been charged in state court with
third-degree murder and manslaughter, although no individuals are
named.
</P>
<P>
   Though federal investigators have pointed to the generators as
the likely cause of the crash, Raskin pointed to the plane itself,
a DC-9 with numerous mechanical and electrical problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plane that crashed was an old plane, with old wiring,''
Raskin said. Neither the plane's auto pilot nor its intercom
worked. Flight attendants had to use a bullhorn to make
announcements to passengers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Valujet, a discount airline based in Atlanta, eventually merged
with Airtran.

SPORTS COLUMN: SOMETIMES CHARACTER PAYS OFF 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's nice to see a team get one right. Bill Parcells' faith in
Ray Lucas was a joy to behold Monday night. The spectacle had
nothing to do with rooting for the Jets, but rather seeing a
blatant case of respect and admiration pay off.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells saw something in Lucas beyond the gleaming intelligence
and ambition that made Lucas a willing member of the special teams.
More important, Lucas saw something in himself throughout a
teasingly inconsistent season.
</P>
<P>
   What a change from the foolish team officials who keep recycling
obvious bad actors like Lawrence Phillips and Isaiah Rider and
Derrick Coleman and, to some degree, a certain Rent-a-Met left
fielder we could name.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody around the Jets knows Parcells wants Lucas to succeed
at quarterback. Parcells is so pragmatic and driven that he rarely
seems to have loyalty or kindness toward anybody, except maybe a
small cadre of coaches and players who live with his blustering
ways.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells is not such a raging egomaniac that he would casually
stick a personal favorite at his game's most important position.
Lucas has been different. The coach saw beyond the hard-working
Jersey guy _ no small consideration, probably _ who played
quarterback for Rutgers but was not projected as more than a
special-teams prospect as a professional.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him when I got him that I didn't know what do with
him,'' Parcells said Tuesday. ``Now I know.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells was looking for a quarterback who could produce on a
cold Monday night in New England. The prospect of this likable and
versatile young player getting a chance brought me to the tube at 9
p.m., probably the first time in 5 or 10 years that I consciously
sat down for a Monday night football game.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a compelling mix of emotion and skill from Lucas,
artfully angled passes and impromptu dashes. The Jets hung on for a
24-17 victory that can fill their entire season highlight film,
which has been looking for content since Vinny T. went down.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the defense and the blockers made it possible for Lucas to
have his wonderful night. Yes, Keyshawn Johnson and Wayne Chrebet
saved drives with their acrobatic catches. But quarterback is the
key position, and Parcells saw something in Lucas that everybody
could savor, oh, for at least a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to work on his fundamentals,'' Parcells was insisting
Tuesday afternoon. ``The only thing he doesn't have to work on is
his desire to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The player had made the plays that won the game, but the coach
had the right to be proud of his faith. General managers and
coaches are often stunned that the man-with-a-history they just
brought in to energize a franchise winds up loafing in practice,
dogging it in games, even playing cards in the clubhouse during a
big game the way Rickey Henderson did this fall with the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't character count for something? You want to scream when
the Atlanta Hawks trade a solid citizen like Steve Smith for a
problem like Isaiah Rider. The Atlanta management must now put up
with Rider's antisocial acts the same way the Charlotte Hornets
must put up with Derrick Coleman's, and insidiously the Knicks are
putting up with Latrell Sprewell's so-far-benign solipsism.
</P>
<P>
   All too often, the club misses the signals for disaster or
confusion. The Yankees, for example, may indeed be trying to obtain
Ken Griffey Jr., which would not only intrude on a team that has
won two straight World Series but also ignores Junior's own history
of loathing the very ground on which the Yankees play.
</P>
<P>
   As everybody knows by now, Junior was frightened at an early age
by every child's idea of the bogeyman, an angry Billy Martin, when
he was playing in the clubhouse. Junior has always implicated
George Steinbrenner in his grudge against the Yankees. Why would
George even think of offering a nine-digit contract to Junior?
</P>
<P>
   Are the Yankees missing Griffey's suspicion of the Big City? His
nervousness with questions from the press? What about the
inevitable conflicts with the owner himself?
</P>
<P>
   Junior does not poison a clubhouse like Albert Belle, does not
antagonize people like Barry Bonds, but he has given clear signals
that he prefers an adoring framework. If smug Seattle couldn't hold
him, he might do well in Cincinnati or Atlanta, where seldom is
heard a discouraging word.
</P>
<P>
   Teams need to observe the clues from players. Sometimes the
attention to character pays off in addition by subtraction.
Sometimes it pays off with a compelling victory on a cold night on
the road, the way a hopeful young quarterback Ray Lucas lived up to
his dreams Monday night.

EGYPT SPECIALISTS TO REVIEW FLIGHT 990 COCKPIT TAPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS AND CHARLES SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The FBI was poised Tuesday to take over the investigation into
the downing of EgyptAir Flight 990 because officials believe the
crash was a deliberate act _ and perhaps the largest mass murder in
American history.
</P>
<P>
   While top officials in US Government agreed to the formal
transfer from the National Transportation Safety Board to the FBI,
it was delayed repeatedly Tuesday by concerns of the Egyptian
government, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   At a briefing late Tuesday, NTSB Chairman James E. Hall praised
the Egyptian government as a ``partner'' in the ongoing
investigation, and said it will send ``experts and officials'' to
help analyze the information from the cockpit voice recorder.
</P>
<P>
   While there was ``no sign of a mechanical or weather-related
event that could have caused this accident,'' Hall said, there are
``differences in cultural interpretation'' of some crucial remarks
on the recorder.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said they still expected the FBI to assume control of
the investigation in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the expected shift, officials still don't know why a
member of the EgyptAir flight crew _ believed to be a co-pilot _
might have deliberately pushed the jet into a terrifying,
near-supersonic dive from its cruising altitude of 33,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   EgyptAir officials said Captain Ahmed El Habashi and First
Officer Adel Anwar were scheduled to fly the first leg of the
11-hour flight from New York's John F. Kennedy International Aiport
to Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Los Angeles Times reported that co-pilot Gamil El
Batouty asked to fly the first leg and was at the controls when the
jet went down. Batouty, 59, was nearing retirement; sources said;
his daughter was critically ill, and the Los Angeles Times said he
was worried about paying for her lupus treatments.
</P>
<P>
   A relative of Batouty called the allegation outrageous.
</P>
<P>
   The expected criminal investigation will now focus on the
members of the flight crew and what they did in the hours, days and
weeks before the flight. The investigation will also explore their
beliefs, relationships, political ties, finances and any criminal
histories.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators hope to discover if the death dive of the Boeing
767-300ER was a suicidal act or a politically-motivated mission
targeting the more than 100 Americans on board, or Egyptian
military personnel, including three generals.
</P>
<P>
   One high-ranking official familiar with the investigation, said
evidence points to ``someone who had personal problems'' rather
than an act of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said investigators believe the crash was deliberate
because, a half-hour after takeoff early on Oct. 31, one pilot left
the cockpit and the remaining pilot talked of ``going into death,''
according to some reports.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe he made the remark just before the plane's
auto-pilot was disconnected.
</P>
<P>
   But if the utterance, which has been described as a prayer, was
made after the plane began to dive, the words may instead represent
``the pious act of a Muslim recognizing he is in great danger,''
said Vince Cannistraro, former CIA head of counter-terrorism
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The brother of co-pilot Batouty reacted vehemently Tuesday to
the direction the investigation was taking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes us very angry to hear the media saying that a man was
praying and therefore he must be either committing suicide or be a
terrorist,'' said Walid Batouty,.
</P>
<P>
   Walid Batouty said his brother, 59, and the father of five, was
scheduled to fly the second leg of the trip once the jetliner
reached the coast of Europe. He expressed disgust at suggestions
that his brother would kill himself and 216 others so his family
could claim insurance money.
</P>
<P>
   ``EgyptAir insurance covered (his daughter's) medical bills and
would do so when he retired,'' Walid Batouty said. ``Why aren't you
focusing on three Boeing airplanes, TWA, Swissair, and EgyptAir
taking off from JFK and crashing?''
</P>
<P>
   There are indications that a battle to control the airplane was
being waged inside the cockpit, when the other member of the flight
crew returned.
</P>
<P>
   Because the elevators on the horizontal stabilizer were in
opposite directions _ one was pointed up, the other down _ aviation
specialists said that indicates a struggle for control of the
airplane in the twin-yoke cockpit, with one pilot pulling on the
yoke to get the plane to climb as the other pushed the other yoke
forward, to make the plane dive.
</P>
<P>
   The voice recorder captures the pilot, who returned to the
cockpit, saying ``pull with me, pull with me,'' one source said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI's expected investigation faces daunting obstacles: there
are no eye-witnesses, the pilots are all dead, those who knew them
best live in the Middle East and speak another language, and much
of the evidence lies deep beneath the Atlantic Ocean, some 60 miles
south of Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said he has asked the Navy to contract for a large ship
with heavy lift capabilities to assist in recovery. Investigators
want to examine the jet's cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   Though investigators are focusing on the men inside the cockpit
that night, those who knew them say none had an obvious reason to
commit such a horrific act.
</P>
<P>
   There were five pilots on board the airplane, but only two were
assigned to be flying the first leg of the 11-hour flight.
</P>
<P>
   According to EgyptAir Captain Roshdy Zakaria, deputy chief pilot
of the Boeing 767-300 for the airline, Capt. Habashi and First
Officer Anwar were at the controls on the first leg of the flight.
Two other pilots, Captain Raouf Noradin and First Officer Batouty,
were the relief crew and sat in an area outside the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   Relief crews are common on long intercontinental flights. Also
on the flight as a passenger was Hatem Rushdie, EgyptAir's chief
pilot for the Boeing 767.
</P>
<P>
   Zakaria doubted that any of the pilots could have intentionally
crashed the plane as a form of suicide, or that one of them could
have been an extremist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know these men well,'' he said. ``They are good pilots, and
they are good men. None of them could be capable of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Anwar, a co-pilot, was a deeply religious man, Zakaria said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would describe him as a devout Muslim, a traditional and
very religious man,'' he said. If it was his voice captured on the
recorder, ``How do we know that this prayer was not the prayer of a
faithful man who knew he was about to die?''
</P>
<P>
   Habashi, 57, was the father of four children and had flown for
38 years. His brother, an air-traffic controller in Cairo, said
Habashi was also a traditional and a devout Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a good father and a good husband and the most
disciplined pilot in the company,'' said Mohammed Habashi.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had no problems in his life,'' said Zakaria. ``He was a
nice guy. . . . I cannot predict what happened, but I don't believe
this talk about a suicide. I know these people too well.''
</P>
<P>
   Anwar was engaged and had asked Zakaria if he could fly the next
New York trip on Friday, Nov. 5, so he and his bride could
honeymoon in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does that sound like someone preparing to kill themselves, and
all of the passengers on a plane?'' Zakaria asked.

UNION LEADERS TO OPPOSE CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL OF CHINA DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Union leaders on Tuesday vowed to try to block congressional
approval of the Clinton administration deal for China to join the
World Trade Organization, predicting that they could stop the
accord the way they had blocked other administration trade
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Several labor leaders said they felt betrayed that President
Clinton, after having promised to ``put a human face on the global
economy,'' would reach a trade-liberalization pact with a country
that has suppressed unions and imprisoned labor leaders.
</P>
<P>
   AFL-CIO president John Sweeney cited a case in which several
Chinese labor leaders were jailed after having led a demonstration
by workers who were demanding back wages.
</P>
<P>
   The director of the AFL-CIO's international department, Barbara
Shailor, said: ``In China, the labor-rights situation is
particularly egregious. It's not only that they can't have unions,
but attempts to form unions will put them in prison and, sometimes,
put them before an execution squad.''
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders predicted that they could block approval by
mustering a majority in the House that would include most
Democrats, labor-friendly Republican moderates and conservative
Republicans angry about what they called China's human rights
violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a very serious fight for us,'' the chief lobbyist
of the AFL-CIO, Peggy Taylor, said. ``This will certainly be as
serious as any trade fight we've been in. The consequences of this
deal are huge.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest concerns is that by letting China join the
WTO, the United States would give up its ability to punish China
unilaterally over trade violations, because the 135-nation group
would adjudicate trade disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders said the accord made it all the more important
that ministers at the trade group's meeting in Seattle in two weeks
agreed to allow trade penalities against countries that violated
fundamental labor rights by, for example, not allowing unions or by
tolerating child labor.
</P>
<P>
   Several union officials said they feared that the trade group
would never approve such penalties after a giant country like China
with extensive labor-rights violations joined.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to fight this big time,'' Mark Levinson, director
of policy at the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile
Employees, said. ``It's an outrage that a country with China's
record on labor rights is allowed into the WTO without any attempt
to improve its record. Once a country as big as China is in the
WTO, that may forever doom the WTO as a forum where progress can be
made on labor rights.''
</P>
<P>
   In condemning the agreement, Sweeney used unusually harsh
language toward an administration that he usually treats as an
ally. Calling the accord ``a grave mistake,'' he said, ``It is
disgustingly hypocritical of the Clinton White House to invoke the
need to `put a human face on the global economy' while prostrating
itself in pursuit of a trade deal with a rogue nation that
decorates itself with human rights abuses as if they were medals of
honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Several union officials said the deal would probably soften
support for Vice President Al Gore, whom the AFL-CIO endorsed for
presidency in October.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1997, the labor movement dealt Clinton one of his
worst legislative blows when it persuaded the House not to approve
a ``fast track'' bill to extend his authority to negotiate trade
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see this as a much bigger fight than fast track,'' Levinson
said. ``The consequences for the U.S. economy are much greater.''
</P>
<P>
   Several labor leaders said they thought that Sweeney would fight
the agreement especially hard, because other labor leaders have
criticized him for not being tough enough on trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to stop this, it's going to be in the House,''
said Teamsters political director Michael Mathis. ``It's going to
be very close.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's economics adviser, Gene Sperling, said that
Washington had won concessions on several labor demands, among them
protections against a surge in imports. Sperling said that China
would not agree to some labor demands and that if the
administration had insisted on them, the agreement would have been
scuttled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pulling China into a rule-based global trading system,''
Sperling said, ``and getting much more involvement by the United
States and other democracies in their economy will in the long run
do more for labor and human rights than making demands that China
wouldn't go along with and would have blown up the agreement.''

SURPRISE CLAIMS COULD COST HANCOCK $32 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. expects to pay
out an extra $32 million this year to cover surprise claims by
newly found heirs of burial policies whose owners the insurer never
knew had died.
</P>
<P>
   In a rush to find scores of missing customers as it converts to
a publicly traded company, the Boston insurer said Tuesday it
expected to find 10 percent of some 400,000 missing policyholders
deceased. That means Hancock must immediately give policy heirs
benefits, typically $1,000 or less.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's 13th-largest life insurer is under fire for losing
track of one-quarter of its customers as it reorganizes from a
mutual company owned by policyholders into a stock company owned by
shareholders. Most missing policyholders who turn out to be alive
are owed stock in the new company, cash, or beefier policies as
part of the transformation. Heirs of policies whose original owners
died get regular death benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that it probably won't succeed in tracking everyone
down before it issues first-time stock Jan. 28, Hancock said
Tuesday it would give missing policyholders up to seven years after
its $2 billion initial public offering to come forward and claim
compensation due under the change. Most policyholders are owed at
least 17 shares, estimated to be worth at least $340. Some
policyholders are owed far more.
</P>
<P>
   The 2.4 million policyholders that Hancock has kept tabs on have
until Nov. 30 to choose stock or cash. Some 2.8 million out of
Hancock's total 3.3 million policyholders are eligible for
compensation under the ``demutualization'' process.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock said beneficiaries, or heirs, typically come forward to
claim money when policyholders pass away. But the insurer admitted
it had lost track of more customers than usual.
</P>
<P>
   To solve its missing persons dilemma, Hancock has enlisted
credit-reporting agencies, address search firms, and state
officials to track customers. The task is tough because many
policies in question were sold earlier this century, before easily
traceable Social Security numbers became commonly used on
documents.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock, which will spend at least $250 million on
demutualization, says it is also hamstrung by privacy laws that
prevent it from seeking policyholders by publishing personal
details, including names, in newspapers and Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   But Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin, whose office
is using voter registration lists to look for customers, said
Hancock is obligated under state law to regularly publish lists of
unpaid dividends _ a procedure that could have helped Hancock track
missing customers had it been followed, Galvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Unusual for the insurance industry, Hancock is making cash, not
stock, the automatic compensation unless policyholders elect to
receive shares. Hancock had hoped to cash out most of its smaller
policyholders, who are an expensive administrative hassle.
</P>
<P>
   But in a big surprise, the insurer is finding that twice as many
people as expected have opted for shares. About 60 percent of
policyholders so far have elected stock, with more than one third
of customers reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials now estimate that nearly one in three
policyholders, or around 900,000, will initially wind up with stock
in the new firm. Previous estimates had projected one in five. The
revised ratio may widen, since some small shareholders will likely
sell their stock. The change means Hancock could have extra cash
from its IPO, since a lesser chunk will used to cash out
policyholders.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Hancock is debating whether to set aside up to 5
percent of shares in the new company for stock option programs,
including 401(k) pension plans, for its 7,500 employees. Top
executives and directors will get hefty stock awards under other
plans in 2001, whose details Hancock has not announced.
</P>
<P>
   The insurer's top brass will not be awarded any form of stock
for one year following the IPO. Hancock executives also can't buy
shares at the IPO price, and thus can't benefit from the bounce
that new shares typically make. Senior executives wanting an
immediate piece of the action can buy stock on the open market 21
days after the IPO.

U.N. SECRETARY - GENERAL DISCUSSES OUTLAWED SECT WITH BEIJING
OFFICIALS

<P>
   BEIJING _ Kofi Annan, the U.N. secretary-general, said Tuesday
that China's foreign minister gave him ``a better understanding''
of the government's crackdown on the outlawed Falun Gong spiritual
movement in a meeting here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Annan said he had been assured that the ``fundamental rights''
are being observed of Falun Gong practitioners, thousands of whom
have been jailed or harassed in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government, with the acquiescence of the United
Nations, has restricted Annan's availability to the press during
his visit but he answered questions during a brief session with a
handful of foreign photographers, television cameramen and one
Asian newspaper reporter, who later distributed a transcript of
Annan's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before Annan's meeting with the foreign minister, Tang
Jiaxuan, some 15 Falun Gong adherents were detained in Tiananmen
Square as they unfurled a banner and began their ritual exercises,
which are said to bring good health and spiritual salvation. Groups
of believers from at least five regions of China have reportedly
sent Annan letters asking for an official inquiry into China's
branding of the group as an illegal, ``evil cult.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, before his arrival here on Sunday for a four-day
visit to discuss U.N. peacekeeping and other topics, Annan said he
planned to make inquiries about the severe crackdown on the
movement, which had attracted millions of followers in China before
it was banned in July.
</P>
<P>
   In his brief public remarks Monday, Annan was clearly loath to
offend China _ a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I leave here with a better understanding of some of
the issues involved,'' he said, adding that Tang told him ``that in
dealing with this issue, the fundamental rights of citizens will be
respected and some of the actions they are taking are for the
protection of individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to clarify Annan's remarks, a spokesman for the
secretary-general, Manoel de Almeida e Silva, said Tuesday night by
telephone that in the meeting with the foreign minister, Annan had
also ``impressed upon them the importance of respecting the
fundamental rights of those involved.''
</P>
<P>
   In that meeting, Annan also offered United Nations help in
strengthening the government's capacity to deal with the Falun Gong
problem ``in accordance with international norms,'' Silva said.
Tang gave no response, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong members, whose leader, Li Hongzhi, is in exile in New
York, shocked the government last April when some 10,000 of them
gathered for an illegal demonstration in Beijing, demanding
official recognition. Since banning the group in July and calling
it a dangerous cult, the government has charged dozens of the
group's top leaders with serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands who have refused to renounce their beliefs have
suffered temporary detentions, been threatened with firings, and in
some cases, been sentenced to labor camps.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government calls the ongoing crackdown ``a violation of
international human rights standards as set forth in instruments
including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
that China has signed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no evidence that practitioners have done anything
other than peacefully exercise their internationally recognized
rights,'' a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy here said Tuesday.

 Lawrence A. Johnson writes about music for The Chicago Tribune, The
New Criterion and Opera News.  
 By LAWRENCE A. JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After the Flux Quartet's recent premiere performance of Morton
Feldman's String Quartet No. 2 in its complete six-hour version,
the three orchestral works on a new Feldman disc seem like
Webernian essays in atomistic compression.
</P>
<P>
   Feldman was a Brooklyn-born original for whom traditional forms
and unfolding musical development held little interest. Rather, he
was fascinated by the sounds of individual notes, the long
silences, expansive structures, isolated chords and spare timbral
combinations, a sonic counterpart to the visual works of artist
friends like Mark Rothko and Jackson Pollock.
</P>
<P>
   For some, Feldman's distinctive brand of musical stasis can be
the equivalent of aural water torture; others find a hypnotic
concentration and enigmatic mystery to his music, which become more
compelling with repeated listening.
</P>
<P>
   Feldman wrote few works for orchestra, yet in the three works
here _ ``Coptic Light,'' ``Piano and Orchestra'' and ``Cello and
Orchestra'' (Argo 448 513-2; CD) _ the more varied palette provides
an ideal entry point into his unique sound world, less daunting and
ascetic than the composer's chamber music.
</P>
<P>
   Written for the New York Philharmonic in 1986, a year before
Feldman died, ``Coptic Light'' takes its title from the composer's
interest in oriental carpets, the intricate patterning of which
provided the impetus for this 30-minute work. Feldman's largest
composition for orchestra, ``Coptic Light'' is characteristic in
its nonlinear progression, proceeding in quiet undulating waves,
though here the textures are more resplendent, the patterns more
complex.
</P>
<P>
   Gentle billows of string chords and rippling piano notes crest
and recede, the interweaving musical textures coalesce and
fragment. Over the long span, the repeated notes in ``Coptic
Light'' become more angular and insistent, later relaxing into a
cascade of harp figures. Like the Eastern textiles from which
Feldman draws his inspiration, there is no beginning or discernible
destination, and it is the concentrated musical tones and
instrumental coloring that sustain the listener's interest.
</P>
<P>
   The two concertante works are more anti-concertos than
traditional solo and orchestra showpieces, and both again show
Feldman's interest in sonic painting with individual notes and
subtle hued timbres. ``Piano and Orchestra'' begins with a single
note from the soloist, to which the strings respond, and for the
next 22 minutes, the cryptic beauty of Feldman's music casts its
spell.
</P>
<P>
   Rare triple fortissimo chords are like seismic upheavals, yet
most of this music derives from its quiet hypnotic power. A change
in piano chording or isolated events like a single swish of a
maraca or a shimmering cymbal assume great significance in this
elliptical, infinitesimally subtle music.
</P>
<P>
   A later motif for double-basses has an undeniable jazz flavor,
and grinding woodwinds present unsettling conflict before the
reprise of the introductory piano chords provide a slight yet
palpable sense of returning to a safe harbor.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Cello and Orchestra,'' the soloist's phrases are longer and
more lyrical in profile, set against an orchestral backdrop of
ominous pedal-points pizzicato passages for the solo cello elicit a
sense of dark drama, as does a rocking two-note repeated passage in
the cello's highest register, which becomes an important part of
the musical flow.
</P>
<P>
   Again, those looking for a linear sonata-form development will
search in vain, but there is a sense of subtle progression and
unfolding progress to these works that reveals itself with close
and repeated listening.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Tilson Thomas, a friend of the composer, shows himself a
superb advocate of Feldman's music in incisive, fully committed
performances with the New World Symphony Orchestra. Throughout, the
conductor brings out the luminosity of this music, allowing
Feldman's iridescent textures to be revealed naturally without any
special pleading.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Feinberg, the pianist, and Robert Cohen, the cellist, prove
equally skillful solo partners in these interpretively difficult
works, and the orchestra's alert and sensitive playing is all one
could wish for.
</P>
<P>
   The excellent recording allows every note of Feldman's music its
full value and color, in an acoustic that ideally blends clarity
and refinement.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ Peace has come to Bosnia, but is
it here to stay?
</P>
<P>
   The American officer who led the 32,000 NATO peacekeepers here
for the last year, Gen. Montgomery Meigs, thinks that it is too
early to say. ``There has been progress,'' he said in a recent
interview here. ``Three years ago they wouldn't even talk to each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian barricades on the road between Sarajevo, where
Muslims are a majority, and the Bosnian Serb Republic, where almost
all the Serbs live, disappeared after the peacekeepers arrived.
Today, driving between the two places is no more eventful than
crossing the border between New York and Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Even in hardline Bosnian Serb villages where graffiti express
support for Arkan, a paramilitary leader charged with crimes
against humanity, some people give a friendly wave to NATO patrols.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the sandbags and concrete brick walls that protected
people in Sarajevo from snipers in the Serb-controlled
neighborhoods across the river during the war, between 1992 and
1995. Brightly painted trolley cars packed with passengers now run
past the gutted, almost totally collapsed concrete headquarters of
the newspaper Oslobodenje, whose basement presses never stopped
rolling.
</P>
<P>
   The ruins of the newspaper's tower, a prime target for the Serbs
during the war, are being preserved as a monument to past
suffering, like the blasted steeple of the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial
Church in West Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   But Oslobodenje is more a symbol of successful Bosnian defiance
than a witness of repentance and reconciliation, as the Berlin
tower is. Those feelings do not yet seem to have taken root among
the Bosnian Serb, Muslim and Croat populations here, driven apart
by the war and still wary of each other.
</P>
<P>
   Radovan Karadzic and Gen. Ratko Mladic, two of the most
notorious Bosnian Serb leaders, both later indicted by an
international tribunal in the Hague on war crimes charges, are
still exercising power behind the scenes, and the peacekeepers have
not arrested them.
</P>
<P>
   Mladic is believed to have fled to Serbia, but Karadzic is said
to be in hiding in a sector of Bosnia that is under the supervision
of French peacekeepers. French and American officials have publicly
batted responsibility for the failure to arrest him back and forth
in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Officials here explain that NATO's prime mission in Bosnia is
not to arrest indicted war criminals but to maintain a safe and
secure environment.
</P>
<P>
   Peacekeepers from 37 countries, their numbers to be reduced to
20,000 after elections next spring, can arrest war crimes suspects
they run across during the normal course of their duties, but only
when they believe that it is prudent and when no bystanders would
get hurt. They have arrested 13 so far.
</P>
<P>
   Meigs, choosing his words carefully, said, ``I wish we had
encountered more persons indicted for war crimes during the course
of our business.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrested war crimes suspects include Gen. Radislav Kristic,
a Bosnian Serb army commander seized last December, and Radislav
Brdanin, a member of the Bosnian Serb parliament, taken in July.
But NATO troops have sometimes treated others differently when they
thought it necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Momir Talic, chief of staff of the Bosnian Serb army, was
secretly indicted in March but not arrested until Aug. 26, while he
was attending a military conference in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   Talic, according to international officials here, was helpful in
keeping Bosnian Serb resentment over the NATO bombing of Kosovo
last spring from soaring out of control. He also supported the
current Bosnian Serb prime minister, Milorad Dodik, a man both the
United States and Russia still believe they can do business with in
Bosnia. Meigs and other NATO officials met with him more than once
to discuss security issues.
</P>
<P>
   Some NATO officials concede that nothing will change
fundamentally in the Serbian part of Bosnia until Karadzic and
Mladic, with their ties to the Yugoslav security apparatus of
President Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade, are taken off the
chessboard.
</P>
<P>
   Meigs, who after a year here turned over command of the force on
Oct. 18 to Lt. Gen. Ronald E. Adams, another American officer, went
back to his overall assignment as commander of the U.S. Army in
Europe, but Adams will also have his work cut out for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next couple of years have to see a lot of developments
here,'' Meigs said. ``The umbilical cords of the various ethnic
communities to Belgrade, Zagreb and the Middle East have to be
cut.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The top Bosnian Muslim leader, President Alija Izetbegovic,
toured Iran, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia last month, and Saudi Arabia
has a big aid mission in Sarajevo, but allied officials are more
worried about Islamic fundamentalist fighters from other countries
who came here to back Bosnian Muslims during the war.
</P>
<P>
   Some apparently can still float in and out. Mehrez Amdouni, a
suspected associate of Osama bin Laden, who is believed to have
been the architect of the attacks on American Embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania last year, turned out to have a Bosnia-Herzegovina
passport when he was arrested last month in Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers here have since been asking the government whether
bin Laden might have one, too, but have so far received no answers.
</P>
<P>
   With municipal elections here expected next spring, Meigs said
there was a chance for democratic institutions to develop, and
perhaps for the return of more than a few tens of thousands of
refugees from other ethnic groups into the homogeneous areas
controlled by Bosnian Muslims, Croats and Serbs that emerged from
the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to help these people define what is an ethical,
controllable state intelligence apparatus,'' Meigs said. ``All of
the mechanism that was built up during the communist years here to
control the population needs to be rooted out, and it hasn't
been.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And the amount of money that's spent on defense in this
country is a scandal,'' he added, with 40 percent of the federal
budget still spent on the military even though fighting among the
Bosnian Serb, Muslim and Croat armies stopped four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   NATO is now trying to get the three factions to reduce their
armed forces from 30,000 in the Serbian part of the country, and
30,000 in the Muslim-Croat federation by 15 percent, as they agreed
to do after an international summit meeting in Sarajevo July 29.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent meeting with Ante Jelavic, the Bosnian Croat member
of the tripartite presidency of this tortured country, Meigs urged
faster progress. ``The extent to which you can attract
international institutions and investments here will depend on the
momentum of improvement,'' the general told him. ``One of the
things I am extremely worried about as I leave is how you build a
court system that all of you can trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Meigs said, true peace might come to the Balkans
only after there is democratic change in Belgrade. ``Until the
people of the former Republic of Yugoslavia change their
government,'' he said, ``things are going to remain pretty
precarious.''

CRUISE SHIP OFFICER FACES CHARGES IN DUMPING CASE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   When Royal Caribbean's newest and biggest ship, Voyager of the
Seas, arrived in Miami last week on its maiden voyage, the
welcoming ceremony included a surprise. Agents of the Immigration
and Naturalization Service boarded the ship and arrested one of its
chief engineers, accusing him of ordering crew members on another
vessel to dump untreated oily waste water into the Pacific Ocean
and the Inside Passage of Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The engineer, Oystein Larsen, 52, was indicted by a federal
grand jury in Los Angeles on charges of conspiracy and causing
false statements to the U.S. Coast Guard about illegal discharges
from the Royal Caribbean ship Nordic Prince in 1994 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   If he is convicted, Larsen will face a maximum of 15 years in
prison and a $750,000 fine. He is free on $250,000 bond pending
arraignment.
</P>
<P>
   For Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., the second-largest cruise line
after Carnival Corp., the arrest was the latest chapter in a long
government investigation into the company's dumping practices.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1998, the company pleaded guilty to discharging
contaminated water from its fleet in the mid-1990s and agreed to
pay $9 million in fines. This year, the company pleaded guilty in
July to six more illegal dumping accusations, including discharging
hazardous waste, and agreed to pay $18 million more in fines.
</P>
<P>
   But the arrest of Larsen was a clear signal that the
government's 5-year-old investigation is continuing. The focus has
shifted from the company to individual Royal Caribbean officers and
employees suspected of participating in the scheme, which involved
using concealed pipes to bypass waste treatment systems and pump
contaminated water overboard in seas from New York to Alaska to
save money.
</P>
<P>
   Documents filed in U.S. District Court in New York and Miami
this month and other records unsealed by a federal judge in Miami
shed new light on the ongoing inquiry and raised accusations that
Royal Caribbean's outside lawyers wrongfully concealed
incriminating information from the government.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Martenstein, a Royal Caribbean spokeswoman, said the
company was cooperating with the authorities in the investigation
of crew members and has instituted strict new environmental
policies.
</P>
<P>
   At sentencing in Miami this month on the line's July guilty
plea, prosecutors praised Royal Caribbean for adopting new
practices, including placing an environmental officer on each of
its ships, installing new waste treatment systems and increasing
training for employees.
</P>
<P>
   But the plaudits contrasted with the picture painted by
government documents of how the company and its lawyers behaved
before the final plea agreement was reached in July.
</P>
<P>
   In a sentencing memorandum for the judge in Miami, prosecutors
said Royal Caribbean, instead of trying to get to the bottom of the
conduct, carried out a shadow investigation of the government's
initial criminal inquiry in an attempt to learn what investigators
were discovering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever the government sought to interview an RCCL employee
or began to focus the investigation upon certain individuals, RCCL
helped to retain, and paid for, a separate attorney to represent
the employee,'' the memo stated. Corporations routinely provide
lawyers for employees, but prosecutors contended that Royal
Caribbean's tactics were defensive and have made it more difficult
to obtain information for the ongoing inquiry into the actions of
unnamed individuals.
</P>
<P>
   What is more unusual, Royal Caribbean agreed to pay an
additional $1 million fine in July because the government said it
had improperly withheld documents. In court papers, the government
accused lawyers from a prominent Washington firm, Venable, Baetjer,
Howard &AMP; Civiletti, of improperly withholding incriminating
documents sought by subpoena in the criminal investigations.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers represented the company in the initial
investigations of dumping in Puerto Rico and Miami, which resulted
in the 1998 pleas.
</P>
<P>
   In an addendum to the sentencing memo, prosecutors Thomas
Watts-FitzGerald and Richard Udell said the outside lawyers learned
that a former Royal Caribbean employee had filed a suit in Norway
that included photographs of a pipe used to bypass the treatment
systems on the line's Sun Viking. Royal Caribbean also provided its
lawyers with a 1996 e-mail that contained specific accusations by a
former employee of illegal dumping by the Sun Viking.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, prosecutors were focusing on two ships and were
unaware of the extent of Royal Caribbean's dumping. The
incriminating material was not turned over because the lawyers said
it was protected by attorney-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   But last summer the information was provided to prosecutors
after the Washington lawyers were replaced by Robert Fiske.
FitzGerald praised Fiske in court for recognizing that the
documents were not privileged and turning them over. As a result of
the delay, however, Royal Caribbean paid an additional $1 million
fine.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Donald Middlebrooks of U.S. District Court in Miami
unsealed the addendum over the objections of Benjamin Civiletti,
chairman of the Venable firm and a former U.S. attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the judge, Civiletti said the decision to
withhold the information was part of a legitimate legal strategy
and argued that it was unfair to impugn the firm and its lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Civiletti made only one appearance in the case; two other
lawyers from the firm, Judson Starr and Jerry Block, were the main
representatives of Royal Caribbean. James Shea, the firm's managing
partner, said the government was exaggerating the episode and could
have challenged the privilege claim during its investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Grand juries in at least two cities, Miami and Los Angeles, are
continuing to examine the role played by individual Royal Caribbean
employees in the illegal dumping.

EGYPT SPECIALISTS TO REVIEW FLIGHT 990 COCKPIT TAPE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS AND CHARLES SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The FBI was poised Tuesday to take over the investigation into
the downing of EgyptAir Flight 990 because officials believe the
crash was a deliberate act _ and perhaps the largest mass murder in
American history.
</P>
<P>
   While top officials in US Government agreed to the formal
transfer from the National Transportation Safety Board to the FBI,
it was delayed repeatedly Tuesday by concerns of the Egyptian
government, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   At a briefing late Tuesday, NTSB Chairman James E. Hall praised
the Egyptian government as a ``partner'' in the ongoing
investigation, and said it will send ``experts and officials'' to
help analyze the information from the cockpit voice recorder.
</P>
<P>
   While there was ``no sign of a mechanical or weather-related
event that could have caused this accident,'' Hall said, there are
``differences in cultural interpretation'' of some crucial remarks
on the recorder.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said they still expected the FBI to assume control of
the investigation in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the expected shift, officials still don't know why a
member of the EgyptAir flight crew _ believed to be a co-pilot _
might have deliberately pushed the jet into a terrifying,
near-supersonic dive from its cruising altitude of 33,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   EgyptAir officials said Captain Ahmed El Habashi and First
Officer Adel Anwar were scheduled to fly the first leg of the
11-hour flight from New York's John F. Kennedy International Aiport
to Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Los Angeles Times reported that co-pilot Gamil El
Batouty asked to fly the first leg and was at the controls when the
jet went down. Batouty, 59, was nearing retirement; sources said;
his daughter was critically ill, and the Los Angeles Times said he
was worried about paying for her lupus treatments.
</P>
<P>
   A relative of Batouty called the allegation outrageous.
</P>
<P>
   The expected criminal investigation will now focus on the
members of the flight crew and what they did in the hours, days and
weeks before the flight. The investigation will also explore their
beliefs, relationships, political ties, finances and any criminal
histories.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators hope to discover if the death dive of the Boeing
767-300ER was a suicidal act or a politically-motivated mission
targeting the more than 100 Americans on board, or Egyptian
military personnel, including three generals.
</P>
<P>
   One high-ranking official familiar with the investigation, said
evidence points to ``someone who had personal problems'' rather
than an act of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said investigators believe the crash was deliberate
because, a half-hour after takeoff early on Oct. 31, one pilot left
the cockpit and the remaining pilot talked of ``going into death,''
according to some reports.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe he made the remark just before the plane's
auto-pilot was disconnected.
</P>
<P>
   But if the utterance, which has been described as a prayer, was
made after the plane began to dive, the words may instead represent
``the pious act of a Muslim recognizing he is in great danger,''
said Vince Cannistraro, former CIA head of counter-terrorism
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The brother of co-pilot Batouty reacted vehemently Tuesday to
the direction the investigation was taking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes us very angry to hear the media saying that a man was
praying and therefore he must be either committing suicide or be a
terrorist,'' said Walid Batouty,.
</P>
<P>
   Walid Batouty said his brother, 59, and the father of five, was
scheduled to fly the second leg of the trip once the jetliner
reached the coast of Europe. He expressed disgust at suggestions
that his brother would kill himself and 216 others so his family
could claim insurance money.
</P>
<P>
   ``EgyptAir insurance covered (his daughter's) medical bills and
would do so when he retired,'' Walid Batouty said. ``Why aren't you
focusing on three Boeing airplanes, TWA, Swissair, and EgyptAir
taking off from JFK and crashing?''
</P>
<P>
   There are indications that a battle to control the airplane was
being waged inside the cockpit, when the other member of the flight
crew returned.
</P>
<P>
   Because the elevators on the horizontal stabilizer were in
opposite directions _ one was pointed up, the other down _ aviation
specialists said that indicates a struggle for control of the
airplane in the twin-yoke cockpit, with one pilot pulling on the
yoke to get the plane to climb as the other pushed the other yoke
forward, to make the plane dive.
</P>
<P>
   The voice recorder captures the pilot, who returned to the
cockpit, saying ``pull with me, pull with me,'' one source said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI's expected investigation faces daunting obstacles: there
are no eye-witnesses, the pilots are all dead, those who knew them
best live in the Middle East and speak another language, and much
of the evidence lies deep beneath the Atlantic Ocean, some 60 miles
south of Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said he has asked the Navy to contract for a large ship
with heavy lift capabilities to assist in recovery. Investigators
want to examine the jet's cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   Though investigators are focusing on the men inside the cockpit
that night, those who knew them say none had an obvious reason to
commit such a horrific act.
</P>
<P>
   There were five pilots on board the airplane, but only two were
assigned to be flying the first leg of the 11-hour flight.
</P>
<P>
   According to EgyptAir Captain Roshdy Zakaria, deputy chief pilot
of the Boeing 767-300 for the airline, Capt. Habashi and First
Officer Anwar were at the controls on the first leg of the flight.
Two other pilots, Captain Raouf Noradin and First Officer Batouty,
were the relief crew and sat in an area outside the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   Relief crews are common on long intercontinental flights. Also
on the flight as a passenger was Hatem Rushdie, EgyptAir's chief
pilot for the Boeing 767.
</P>
<P>
   Zakaria doubted that any of the pilots could have intentionally
crashed the plane as a form of suicide, or that one of them could
have been an extremist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know these men well,'' he said. ``They are good pilots, and
they are good men. None of them could be capable of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Anwar, a co-pilot, was a deeply religious man, Zakaria said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would describe him as a devout Muslim, a traditional and
very religious man,'' he said. If it was his voice captured on the
recorder, ``How do we know that this prayer was not the prayer of a
faithful man who knew he was about to die?''
</P>
<P>
   Habashi, 57, was the father of four children and had flown for
38 years. His brother, an air-traffic controller in Cairo, said
Habashi was also a traditional and a devout Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a good father and a good husband and the most
disciplined pilot in the company,'' said Mohammed Habashi.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had no problems in his life,'' said Zakaria. ``He was a
nice guy. . . . I cannot predict what happened, but I don't believe
this talk about a suicide. I know these people too well.''
</P>
<P>
   Anwar was engaged and had asked Zakaria if he could fly the next
New York trip on Friday, Nov. 5, so he and his bride could
honeymoon in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does that sound like someone preparing to kill themselves, and
all of the passengers on a plane?'' Zakaria asked.

CELLUCCI BACKS OFF ON CAMPAIGN REFORM VETO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS AND MICHAEL CROWLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a suprise move, Governor Paul Cellucci Tuesday
backed off on his threats to veto money for a new campaign reform
law and struck down language inserted by legislative leaders that
reformers say would have gutted the law.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said he ultimately decided voters' approval of the law
last year must be respected, and okayed $10 million for a fund to
to publicly finance elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``To substantially change what the voters have approved would be
wrong,'' Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   But well-placed Beacon Hill sources said the governor's switch
was in part driven by an increasingly bitter feud with Senate
President Thomas Birmingham, which intensified after Birmingham
threatened to nix a $45,000 pay raise for Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's announcement, which jolted Beacon Hill, came as he
unveiled 346 vetoes totalling $250 million from the Legislature's
$20.9 billion budget.
</P>
<P>
   The vetoes included striking $94 million of $245 million set
aside for local education reform money, a move which touched off
anger from school and municipal officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is the education governor, let him go get another
cause,'' said James A. Caradonio, superintendent for Worcester
schools, which stand to lose $2.5 million for new textbooks,
computers and building upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino called Cellucci's move
``short-sighted'' and charged the state ``is not really serious
about improving our schools.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci also added an amendment to a $60 million early
retirement plan for teachers, calling for a study of how public
schools system will replace the teachers. Supporters say Cellucci's
language will kill the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci also vetoed millions in other education programs,
including $10.1 million for early childhood education grants and $3
million in kindergarten expansion grants.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the governor eliminated vetoed $10 million for
expansion of anti-smoking programs, $6.5 million in raises for
low-paid human services workers, and legislative language that
would have halted the phase out of the capital gains tax.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of the vetoes are likely to be overriden before the
Legislature adjourns for the year at midnight Wednesday. It was
still not clear Tuesday whether the Legislature would reconvene for
a special session if it runs out of time to override all the
vetoes.
</P>
<P>
   Birmingham said he was ``absolutely speechless'' over the
governor's veto of the education reform money, which he called mean
spirited.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci shot back, calling Birmingham ``a big-spending
liberal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted last week to suspend its rules and return if
necessary, but House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran has resisted
efforts to extend its session, although he has not ruled out the
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's vetoes would chop the budget increase over last
year's spending from 7 to 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   His switch on the campaign finance funding created the biggest
political stir, because early in the week word leaked out from the
administration that the governor had decided to veto the funds
because he did not believe in public funding of campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The Clean Elections law, a ballot question passed by 67 percent
of voters last year, provides public funds to candidates who agree
to limit their campaign spending.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference where he signed the budget, Cellucci said,
despite his personal opposition, that he concluded a veto of the
money that will go toward funding the new law would undercut faith
in the initiative petition process.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci cited his own campaign now under way to use the ballot
to cut the state income tax back to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But State House sources said Cellucci has grown irritated at
Birmingham, because the Senate leader was threatening to stall the
payraise bill for the governor and other constitutional officers.
The bill, which would give Cellucci a more than 50 percent increase
in pay, has passed the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Birmingham is trying to personalize the pay raise issue,''
said one top Democratic source.
</P>
<P>
   The sources suggested Birmingham and Finneran expected Cellucci
to jettison the money, which would severely undermine the new
system and discourage possible candidates from challenging Beacon
Hill incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci also vetoed the language slipped in by Birmingham and
Finneran that would have permitted incumbents to raise huge amounts
of money during most of their terms, then still receive public
campaign funds in the final six months of the election cycle.
Proponents of the new law said that would have been a fatal blow.
</P>
<P>
   Birmingham said he welcomed the governor's decision to keep the
$10 million funding in the budget, and suggested he did not feel
strongly about Cellucci's veto of the language change he and
Finneran inserted.
</P>
<P>
   But administration sources said Birmingham had lobbied strongly
over the weekend for Cellucci to keep the language changes.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci aides are convinced the governor has called
Birmingham's bluff by sending the langauges changes back to the
legislature with a veto.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Birmingham and Finneran will be forced to take up the Clean
Elections issue again, in full public view, if they seek to
override Cellucci.

 &HT;    More can join UGA lawsuit
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Now that hundreds of students can join a reverse
discrimination lawsuit against the University of Georgia's
admissions program, lawyers will begin to try and find them.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge B. Avant Edenfield of Savannah, Ga., granted
class-action status Monday to a lawsuit challenging UGA's
admissions program.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed by four white females who were denied
admission, claims the university unconstitutionally discriminated
against them by providing preferences to male and African-American
applicants.
</P>
<P>
   UGA no longer uses gender as a factor, but it continues to give
added weight to applications filed by prospective African-American
students.
</P>
<P>
   Edenfield ruled the class-action case can include students
unconstitutionally denied admission to future freshmen classes, as
well.
</P>
<P>
   UGA spokesman Tom Jackson expressed disappointment in the
ruling, but noted, ``It's not an entirely unexpected development.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great news,'' said Atlanta lawyer Lee Parks, who
represents the women plaintiffs. He renewed his call for UGA to
stop using race as a factor in admissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think now that they've seen the judge has certified this as
a class action, they'll reconsider it,'' Parks said. ``Every time
you reject somebody based on race at this point, you're just adding
another zero to the check. You can't do it prudently. This is tax
money we're talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks said damage claims against UGA could be significant.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the students with potential claims would have
qualified for the HOPE scholarship, he said. When denied admission
to UGA, many attended private schools and now pay tuition costs of
as much as $25,000 a year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Parks said he will put together a letter, to be approved by
Edenfield, that will be mailed to potential class action
plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   They include any students who claim to have been denied
admission because of their race or gender in the freshman classes
of 1997, 1998 and 1999. The cutoff is the 1997 academic year due to
the statute of limitations on damage claims, Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   He estimated the potential number of eligible plaintiffs to be
100 to 200 for each year.
</P>
<P>
   The number of legitimate claims could be much smaller. When
deciding how many plaintiffs have a viable claim, the lawyers would
have to consider the number of freshman class openings. Also to be
taken into account would be how many students benefited from an
admissions formula called the Total Student Index. The formula
gives added weight to an applicant's academic standing if the
applicant were a minority or a male.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the names and prior addresses of potential class members
should be accomplished quickly, Parks said. He predicted UGA may be
required to begin admitting wrongly denied applicants as early as
January.
</P>
<P>
   While Edenfield did not address the issue of whether UGA's
admission policy is constitutional, the judge has made it clear
that he thinks the use of race and gender cannot be legally
justified.
</P>
<P>
   UGA has said it modeled its admissions program on the 1978 U.S.
Supreme Court decision, Regents of the University of California v.
Bakke. In that decision, the late Justice Lewis Powell wrote ``the
interest of diversity is compelling in the context of a
university's admissions program.''
</P>
<P>
   Edenfield conceded the Bakke ruling is still the law of the
land. But in light of more recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings, he
noted, ``there is indeed strong doubt as to whether Bakke's
reasoning remains sound.''

WHITE HOUSE AND GOP LEADERS SEEK TO PUT FINISHING TOUCHES ON
BUDGET 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House and the Republican Congress
struggled on Tuesday night to pay for nearly $7 billion in new
spending with using money from excess Social Security contributions
to cover the costs.
</P>
<P>
   Once an agreement is reached, Republicans will try to pas the
remaining five budget bills in one $390 billion package.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very, very close,'' said the House majority whip, Tom
DeLay of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But they are still demanding that the White House agree to an
across-the-board cut of .42 percent in all the spending bills, and
so far, the White House has not budged. President Clinton vetoed a
.97 percent across-the-board cut passed by Congress two weeks ago,
calling it a ``blind'' and ``mindless'' way to make a budget.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on its size, that cut could recoup some or most of the
$7 billion the Republicans have added in recent weeks, some of it
on their own, some at the president's behest.
</P>
<P>
   The rest could be made up with accounting maneuvers, like
delaying the last paycheck for Pentagon personnel in September 2000
until after Oct.1, the beginning of the next fiscal year, which
would shift more than $2 billion from this year's budget into next.
</P>
<P>
   There was one encouraging sign as night fell on the Capitol:
Jack Lew, the White House budget director, was carrying a small
notebook instead of a bulging briefcase when he entered the
chambers of the Senate Appropriations Committee to talk with the
Republican negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those Republicans, like the chairmen of the Senate and
House Appropriations committees, Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska and
Rep. C.W. Bill Young of Florida, say they hate the idea of an
across-the-board cut, because it trims spending indiscriminately.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, they have to support it. Their leaders have
demanded it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be some across-the-board cut,'' promised the House
majority leader, Rep. Dick Armey of Texas. Stevens said on Tuesday
night that the idea was ``on the table,'' but ``on the edge of the
table,'' where it has been pushed by Democrats' opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans say that either the White House must make the
cut or come up with nearly $7 billion in savings by some
combination of specific cuts and accounting mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
   The $7 billion in savings is necessary for the Republicans to be
able to claim the final budget will not dip into Social Security
surpluses. That vow has been their rallying cry in Congress this
year.
</P>
<P>
   But to keep that promise, they have used a budgetary device
making close to $20 billion in spending disappear from the federal
ledger _ a device calculated by the Republicans to make their
numbers come out the way they want.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office puts the total cost of the
year's 13 spending bills at roughly $610 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That is $30 billion more than the spending limits, or caps, that
Congress swore to uphold in this year's budget when it passed the
Balanced Budget Act of 1997. It is at least $15 billion more than
the surplus of general government funds, which would mean that the
rest would have to come from the Social Security reserves.
</P>
<P>
   In the final analysis, said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the
Republican-controlled Congress ``spent money from the Social
Security trust fund, and we busted the caps that were agreed to in
1997. It's all very, very regrettable,'' he said in an interview
with CNN. ``And we may pay a heavy price in not being able to make
Social Security whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the other Republicans in Congress fervently deny
this. ``Republicans have balanced _ will have balanced the budget
without raiding Social Security,'' DeLay said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The different tenses he used show that Republicans may have to
rely on higher-than-expected tax revenues in the coming months to
ensure that their fiscal 2000 budget will not use the retirement
reserves.
</P>
<P>
   If that does not happen, they may have to find a way to cut the
budget in midyear, said DeLay, who has been the chief Republican
spending strategist in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is,'' DeLay explained, ``we will have a mid-course
correction come January or February, and if it looks like we're
going to spend the Social Security surplus, we'll cut spending to
make sure we don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the spending bills tap into surplus Social
Security revenues has absolutely no effect on the long-term fiscal
health of the retirement funds, according to almost every
independent budget analyst and fiscal expert.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the political contest over which party is the truer
guardian of the Social Security system has become one of the big
symbolic struggles in this session of Congress.

CLINTON PLEDGES MORE AID 
TO TURKISH QUAKE VICTIMS 

</HEADLINE>

c. 1999, Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ President Clinton toured a tent city filled
with earthquake survivors Tuesday, promising more U.S. aid to a
nation devastated by back-to-back temblors.
</P>
<P>
   The president, accompanied by first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
and daughter Chelsea, strolled from tent to tent in nearby Izmit
during a steady cold rain to comfort families who lived through the
Aug. 17 earthquake that claimed 17,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to know that we in the United States will do
everything we can to help you until your lives return to normal,''
Clinton told a crowd. ``We will stay with you and work with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the United States would send another 10,000 tents
in response to a second earthquake last week in nearby Duzce. The
United States initially provided 6,000 tents after the Aug. 17
quake left 300,000 people homeless. Turkey also will be eligible
for $1 billion in Export-Import Bank loan guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton urged the Turks to take the opportunity presented by
warmer relations with Greece to move toward a permanent
reconciliation. Both countries momentarily suspended their rivalry
to help the other with earthquake aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the ordinary people in Greece and Turkey who have
suffered from these terrible natural disasters can send a clear
message to the leaders that the people of this region can get
along, and they should get along, and when they do get along, our
children's lives and futures are better,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president touring a disaster area has become a common scene
in the United States where he often surveys the damage caused by
floods or hurricanes, and meets with those who lived through it.
</P>
<P>
   For the Turks, it was all rather new.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the devastation, families greeted the Clintons with a
``welcome'' sign and pink roses for the first lady. The Clintons
ambled down a double row of cotton-lined, olive-green tents,
entering the new home of the Gencenler family. Seventeen people,
down from 21, live amid seven mattresses, two small sofas, two
electric space heaters, a refrigerator and a television set.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the most difficult thing about living in this tent?''
the president asked a woman holding a small baby. ``The hard days
of winter,'' she responded. ``And the humidity in the tent. The
heat makes a lot of humidity.''
</P>
<P>
   They were among 9,000 people living in 1,200 tents in this
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   A 2-year-old named Betul crawled into Chelsea Clinton's lap.
``We're grateful for you letting us into your home. We wanted to
listen and think about what the next steps are, how we can restore
you to a normal life,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are grateful to God and our government,'' the woman
responded.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also spoke to Ismail Yoldas, a paper-factory worker
injured by a falling beam. His family rushed cookies and tea to the
Clintons. The Clintons also toured a makeshift school, where one
boy held up a misspelled but well-intentioned sign: ``Welcome to
Clintion. I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   Another boy called out, ``We want to thank the American children
for their support.'' The students sang a Turkish children's song.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the rubble in the city has been cleared away, and
hundreds lined the street to see the president.
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Guarnieri, a member of the National Security Council
humanitarian staff, said the people in Izmit felt the tremors from
the earthquake last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really shook people up emotionally,'' she said. Duzce is
about 70 miles from Izmit. ``Shelter is really critical,'' she
said, noting the temperature falls below freezing at night.
</P>
<P>
   She estimated the residents would live in the tent city through
the winter. ``Clearly, a lot needs to be done,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Two rescue teams from the United States helped locate survivors
and the dead after the Aug. 17 incident. The United States
government also provided three ships, 2,200 Marines and 22
helicopters to assist people. U.S. officials helped restore the
water system in Izmit. They also provided 10,000 body bags.
</P>
<P>
   The twin earthquakes have many of this city's residents on edge.
Wire services reported many citizens near panic this week amid
fears of a third disaster. Some people spent the night in parks or
in their cars, afraid to stay in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   So far, earthquake concerns have had little effect on the
president's schedule. He will attend a two-day summit here of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe beginning
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, on day three of a 10-day tour of southeastern Europe,
also went sightseeing in this historic city, once a major hub of
the Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman empires.

   NETHERLANDS: CHIEF JUDGE PICKED
</P>
<P>
   Judge Claude Jorda of France was picked as the new president of
the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in
The Hague. Chosen from among the panel's 14 judges, he succeeds the
American Gabrielle Kirk McDonald, who chose not to extend her
expiring term. Jorda, 61, has criticized the panel's backlog of
cases and has said he plans reforms.
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE: SUED OVER BEEF
</P>
<P>
   The European Union's executive decided to bring legal action
against France because it continues to ban British beef in defiance
of a ruling ordering the ban lifted. France has said mad cow
disease still poses a threat to consumers of British beef. Paris
officials said they were close to lifting the ban. Other countries
also still bar British beef, including Germany.
</P>

<P>
   A parliamentary committee approved a government proposal to
award $2 million to the families of each of the 20 ski tourists
killed when a U.S. military jet cut the cables of a ski lift in
northern Italy in February 1998. The bill now goes to the Senate
for approval.

   BRITAIN: CANCER RULING
</P>
<P>
   In a landmark decision, Britain's Court of Appeal ruled that a
hospital was negligent when it failed to diagnose cancer in three
women. Each will receive damages ranging from $32,500 to $48,700,
their lawyer said, paving the way for other cases in Britain, which
has one of the worst cancer-related death rates in western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY: SLAVE TALKS STALL
</P>
<P>
   Two-day talks in Bonn on compensating Nazi-era slave workers
have stalled over how much money survivors should get. Wolfgang
Gibowski, spokesman for a group of German companies, described as
``absolute nonsense'' a statement by the victims' lawyer that
companies and the government had increased their joint offer to
$5.3 billion from $3.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY: U.S. NEWSMAN RULING
</P>
<P>
   A court told an American journalist charged with slandering the
Turkish army that the charge would be dropped if he committed no
other offense in the next three years. The journalist, Andrew
Finkel, who wrote the article for an Istanbul newspaper, said he
had hoped for a full acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   SPAIN: PROTEST ON NEO-NAZIS
</P>
<P>
   The Simon Wiesenthal Center urged the government to halt
neo-Nazi activities in the formerly deserted village of Los
Pedriches in southeast Spain. The center said neo-Nazis are
organizing paramilitary camps in the village. News reports said two

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A detailed analysis of the voice and data recorders
aboard EgyptAir 990 indicates that a crew member, possibly a relief
pilot, seized the controls of the passenger jet and forced the
plane into a steep dive toward the Atlantic Ocean, government
officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the new information, investigators theorize that the
veteran captain of the Boeing 767, Ahmed el-Habashy, who had
briefly left the cockpit and returned, struggled in vain to regain
control of the aircraft after the other pilot calmly uttered an
Arabic expression about putting his trust in God, switched off the
autopilot and pitched the Boeing 767 into the high-speed plunge.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the relief pilot at the center of the inquiry
was Gamil al-Batouti, a veteran EgyptAir employee and former Air
Force aviator. Batouti was not assigned to fly the plane at the
time of the crash, but the officials said they believe he is the
man in the co-pilot's seat whose remark about God can be heard
seconds before the plane began its fatal descent.
</P>
<P>
   The expression apparently uttered by the relief pilot was,
``Tawakilt ala Allah,'' which is a common phrase that can mean, ``I
put my faith in God,'' or ``I entrust myself to God.'' In the Arab
world, the phrase is used often, especially at the start of a
journey or a task. It can be used by someone about to begin
something as simple as cooking a meal.
</P>
<P>
   EgyptAir representatives familiar with the voice of the
airline's crews listened to the cockpit voice recorder and
identified the voice of Batouti, the officials said. But the
officials cautioned that they have no other verification of
Batouti's voice and warned that further analysis of the information
might lead them to different conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The increasing likelihood that the relief pilot, or another
EgyptAir crew member, deliberately brought down the aircraft led
the authorities Tuesday to prepare to transfer the inquiry to the
FBI. The agency's director, Louis J. Freeh, has been eager to take
over the case from the National Transportation Safety Board, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But with the hand-off to the FBI imminent, Egyptian officials
complained bitterly about the move, the officials said. It became a
matter of serious diplomatic concern as the Egyptian ambassador,
Nabil Fahmy, met with Undersecretary Thomas Pickering at the State
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that the Egyptians asserted that the American
authorities might have misread the evidence and too quickly
dismissed the possibility that the plane crashed as a result of a
mechanical failure or some other problem.
</P>
<P>
   In the Egyptian scenario, the co-pilot's comment could have been
a worried response to some as-yet undetermined mechanical breakdown
that a few seconds later caused him to disengage the autopilot. The
Egyptians said that the pilot's urgent words to his co-pilot,
``What's going on?'' could have referred to his concern over the
same undetermined problem.
</P>
<P>
   But, the chairman of the safety board, Jim Hall, said Tuesday
evening that investigators have ``so far found no sign of a
mechanical or weather related event that could have caused this
accident.'' Nevertheless, Hall stopped short Tuesday of turning the
case over to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said that in the next few days, Egyptian investigators and
senior EgyptAir representatives familiar with the Arabic used in
the cockpit would evaluate the tape from the voice recorder. Other
administration officials emphasized that they did not view the
Egyptian concerns as an effort to slow down the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said that in many crashes involving American crews, safety
board experts often cannot agree about what the pilots were saying.
``It is made slightly more difficult in this situation because the
expressions and conversations are in Arabic,'' he said.

WITH AGREEMENTS IN SIGHT, 
CLINTON CHEERS CASPIAN PIPELINES 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c. 1999, Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Ignoring continued agitation by Russia,
President Clinton embraced proposed Caspian Sea oil and gas
pipelines Tuesday as critical to the region's future and security.
</P>
<P>
   ``These will help to diversify our sources of energy and help
the newly independent countries of the Caucasus and Central Asia
stand on their own feet. They will put Turkey, our trusted ally,
front and center in the effort to create a secure energy future,''
Clinton told executives at the Turkish Business Council.
</P>
<P>
   Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey will sign an agreement this week
offering promises of financial support plus a legal framework for
the project when 54 nations gather here for the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   They hope the accord will prod an 11-member oil company
consortium to construct a $2.4 billion, 1,240-mile oil pipeline
from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku, through Georgia, to the
Turkish port city of Ceyhan on the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   A second agreement for a $2.5 billion gas pipeline will be
signed by the same three countries and Turkmenistan to bring gas
from Turkmenistan to Turkey. Clinton will witness the signings on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As part of that accord, Turkey agrees to cover cost overruns
associated with construction inside its borders. But the oil
company partners have not yet committed to the deal. U.S. officials
are hoping the gas pipeline will be in place by 2002 and the oil
pipeline by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   For six years the Clinton administration has pushed the idea of
the Caspian Sea pipelines to counter efforts to construct a system
through Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. plan has upset Russia, which accuses the United States
of attempting to take advantage of its weakened status and control
the reserves. The U.S.-backed plan would loosen the hold Russia has
over former Soviet states, but the United States contends it will
foster democracy in those emerging nations.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Mike Hammer said the political goal of the
United States is to avoid placing a pipeline across Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Kremlin envoys traveled to Baku last weekend to urge Azari
officials to back away from any deal that bypasses Russia and Iran.
Russia contends its proposed alternative across the Black Sea is
more feasible. But a U.S. official said Azerbaijan remains
committed to the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made great strides toward the proposed Baku-Ceyhan oil
pipeline and the trans-Caspian gas pipeline,'' Clinton told the
Turkish business executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll bet if you polled the citizens of the United States and
Turkey, over 90 percent of them would never have heard of the
Baku-Ceyhan oil pipeline or the trans-Caspian gas pipeline. But if
we do this right, 20 years from now, 90 percent of them will look
back and say, thank you, for making a good decision at a critical
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkish President Suleyman Demirel called the pipelines
``pivotal projects'' for the region. ``These projects offer the
most economic, shortest and safest alternative for energy
transportation,'' Demirel told the Turkish executives.
</P>
<P>
   Oil reserves also are a key factor in Russia's efforts to quash
any Islamic rebellion in Chechnya. Its bombing of civilians also
will be a major topic of discussion at the OSCE sessions.
</P>
<P>
   The oil pipeline project is spearheaded by the Azerbaijan
International Operating Co., led by London-based BP Amoco. The
consortium plans to spend upwards of $10 billion to produce an
estimated 4 billion barrels of oil from Caspian Sea fields off the
coast of Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium currently is exporting about 100,000 barrels of
Caspian crude, primarily through a relatively small pipeline that
runs from the Azeri capital of Baku to Supsa, a Georgian port on
the Black Sea, a consortium spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium has a second pipeline that extends to the Russian
Black Sea port of Novorossiysk. But that pipeline traverses
Chechnya. And the Russians, who must take possession of the oil
once it crosses the border, have been unable to do so in recent
weeks as the fighting in Chechnya has raged.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials have assured officials in Baku they could
build a bypass around Chechnya within six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since they've been saying that for quite a while, there's not
really any evidence of that happening,'' said Michael Townshend, BP
Amoco's director of international affairs in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, BP Amoco threw its support behind the Baku-Ceyhan
route, but the other partners must still be persuaded.
</P>
<P>
   Oil companies long have been reluctant to commit such a
substantial amount of money to construct a pipeline, in large part,
because the reserves discovered in the Caspian have fallen short of
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium partners have been looking for companies
exploring other fields in the region to help cover the cost of the
pipeline. The agreement to be signed this week will give potential
participants the legal and commercial framework they will need to
evaluate the project, Townshend said.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium partners have long argued that if government
leaders believe a Baku-Ceyhan line is so vital to the stability of
the region, then the governments should provide subsidies to help
defray the cost of construction.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration already has promised to provide
support for the project through the Export-Import Bank, the
Overseas Private Investment Corp. and the Trade and Development
Agency.

TALKS IN CUBA PROVIDE OUTLET FOR DISSIDENTS

<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA _ The business card of Elizardo Sanchez, a leading
dissident here, has a curious caveat next to his phone number: ``if
it works.''
</P>
<P>
   It currently does, and then some. At his home, where the living
room is arrayed with pictures of him with the likes of Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass., and the Czech president, Vaclev Havel, Sanchez
has been contacted by at least nine of the delegations that came to
Havana to attend a summit meeting of Spanish and
Portuguese-speaking countries.
</P>
<P>
   He is not alone. At least 14 other Cuban human rights advocates
and relatives of political prisoners have held meetings with
visiting heads of state and other dignitaries, including the
Spanish prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar, and the Mexican foreign
minister, Rosario Green.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban participants in these meetings said discussions included
issues like multiparty democracy, open markets, freedom of
expression and _ they pointedly added _ an end to the U.S. embargo
against Cuba. They said the meetings were held at the request of
the various delegations, and passed without incident or impediment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never before have we seen so many dignitaries coming to our
country to meet with dissidents and opponents of the government,''
Sanchez said, moments before he was whisked off in a van to meet
with a delegation from Brazil. ``This is a great acknowledgement of
a sector of our country, whose government said for many years we
did not exist or were nonpersons.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings come one week after Cuban officials not only
criticized the dissidents for wanting to hold a parallel meeting,
but detained several dozen of them for hours, and kept another 15
under arrest on suspicion of planning acts of sabotage to disrupt
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to allow Sanchez and others to meet with the
foreign dignitaries appeared to be a calculated move by the
government to allow some openness and to avoid public conflicts
that would mar the country's moment in the spotlight as host to a
meeting of presidents, prime ministers and other officials from 21
Latin American nations, Spain and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials do not view the dissidents as a monolithic
group, which may also explain whey they have not interfered with
the meetings. They distinguish between those like Sanchez _ who is
seen as a thoughtful, if ideologically opposed, figure _ and others
who are viewed as puppets of the exile community, dedicated to
destabilizing the regime.
</P>
<P>
   They insist that the groups do not present a real challenge or
an alternative to the current government.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Green said in a prepared statement that her meeting with
Sanchez did not constitute a change in Mexico's policy against
intervening in the affairs of other nations. Sanchez said that the
Mexican government can nevertheless play a helpful role in Cuba, as
it has in helping to resolve the regional conflicts in Central
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though there is no civil war in Cuba, there is still a
strong confrontation between Washington and Havana,'' he said.
``Due to the good relations Mexico has with both countries, it
could make a bigger contribution to normalizing relations between
Havana and the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   While not explicitly condemning the Cuban government, several of
the dignitaries who met with the dissidents expressed carefully
worded support for their concerns. Aznar, the Spanish prime
minister, said he met with the dissidents because he was not a
``part-time democrat'' and that he always wanted to make as many
contacts as possible wherever he traveled.
</P>
<P>
   Even before this week's meetings, four jailed dissidents
received a letter of solidarity signed by 43 human rights advocates
and political leaders from Eastern Europe, including Havel; former
President Lech Walesa of Poland, and Yelena Bonner, the widow of
the Russian dissident Andrei Sakharov. The letter invoked the
memory of Jose Marti, the nationalist leader who is still revered
in Cuba for his fight against Spanish rule.
</P>
<P>
   In his opening remarks Tuesday morning, Castro ignored the
dissidents, and declared that he remains committed to the path he
chose decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke of the first such meeting in Guadalajara, Mexico, eight
years ago, when Cuba was widely urged to shed its communist system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advice rained down from everywhere,'' he said. ``But we
thought of another way and decided to struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials now say that after several harsh years of a
subsistence economy following the end of support from the former
Soviet Union, the economy is growing. Tourism has contributed
greatly, and the country is getting better credit terms, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting has given the government a chance to project an
image of its society different from the one offered by Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Modest crowds turned out to greet King Juan Carlos of Spain as
he toured the restoration of elegant buildings in Old Havana. The
visitors also went to inaugural ceremonies at the new Latin
American School of Medical Science, where 1,929 students from
Central and South America are studying medicine. Enrollment is
expected to reach 8,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   But the highlight of the week has already come for Hector
Palacios, a dissident who founded the Democratic Solidarity Party,
an act that led to a prison term. Like Sanchez, he said his morale
was improved by the visits with the foreign dignitaries. Yet he was
also realistic about the lasting effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we won a lot in expectations and hope,'' he said.
``Hope that we will become stronger. Hope that we will have other
doors to knock on. Hope that other eyes will look out for us. But I
do not have hope that the government will change or make a gesture
of flexibility soon.''

MEXICAN POLLSTERS CHALLENGE SIZE OF TURNOUT IN PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Several independent pollsters have challenged
official results of the governing party's Nov. 7 presidential
primary that showed a huge turnout of voters.
</P>
<P>
   Two pollsters suggested that party may have exaggerated the
turnout, perhaps greatly, to enhance the image of the party's
invincibility going in the presidential race next year. But they
did not question the outcome of the primary, won by Francisco
Labastida Ochoa, the candidate of the power structure.
</P>
<P>
   The pollsters' findings have added to an uneasy sense in the
country over figures published by the Institutional Revolutionary
Party showing that 9.72 million people voted in its first
competitive primary, which was open both to party members and
outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   Party leaders, including President Ernesto Zedillo, pointed to
the robust turnout to say that the primary drew an enthusiastic
response and demonstrated that the party is going strong despite
years of economic crises and corruption scandals.
</P>
<P>
   For the party, known as the PRI, proving that the primary was
clean and fair is crucial to rebuilding its credibility. The party
has dominated Mexican politics for seven decades, but has been
famous in the past for winning elections by buying votes.
</P>
<P>
   Party officials vigorously defended the accuracy of the primary
vote count. ``We did not invent these figures,'' Felipe Solis
Acero, a top official of the party commission which ran the
primary, said Tuesday. ``Behind every vote, there is a ballot that
has been marked.''
</P>
<P>
   The pollsters say they do not doubt that Labastida won a
crushing victory over his closest opponent, Roberto Madrazo
Pintado. According to the final results Labastida won the most
votes in 272 of 300 electoral districts while Madrazo came out
ahead in only 21.
</P>
<P>
   The district results were based on a reported total of 5.33
million votes cast for Labastida and 2.76 million for Madrazo. The
remaining 1.63 million were divided among two other contenders and
invalid votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was inflated,'' said Daniel Lund, who conducts
polls for Mori de Mexico, an affiliate of a British public opinion
firm. ``The total is just not credible.''
</P>
<P>
   Lund said the candidates' percentages appeared to be correct,
but he estimated that no more than 5 million votes were cast in
all. Lund did not conduct a complete exit poll, but had observers
posted at polling stations around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we saw in the polling places was that roughly half of the
people reported as having voted actually appeared so we could count
them,'' Lund said.
</P>
<P>
   Alejandro Moreno, who conducted a nationwide exit poll Nov. 7
for the newspaper Reforma, said, ``It appears that there were a lot
more votes than voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreno said many of his poll-takers called in during the day to
report that they could not get his required minimum of 15 voter
interviews at a polling station. He said he was astonished to see
that the final results for the same polling places showed 150 or
more voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers don't check out,'' Moreno said. Both pollsters
acknowledged that their information is incomplete and both said
they intended to conduct new studies.
</P>
<P>
   Both men, and a third pollster from a separate firm who
expressed similar doubts but asked not to be identified, presented
their views Monday to a group of American portfolio investors at a
closed-door conference organized by Warburg Dillon Read, the
investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   Another pollster, Warren Mitofsky, who conducted a exit poll at
5,000 voting stations for the Televisa television network, disputed
his colleagues' contentions. Based on what he called ``an enormous
national sample,'' he estimated on the night of the primary that
just over 10 million people had voted.
</P>
<P>
   After casting his ballot in a desolate polling station in
northern Mexico, one of the losing candidates, Humberto Roque
Villanueva, lamented that the turnout had been ``less than
expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, in the hours after the results were announced, frustrated
followers of Madrazo complained of vote-buying and ballot-box
stuffing by Labastida across the country.
</P>
<P>
   But Madrazo, faced with a decisive defeat, surprised his
followers by deciding not to challenge the honesty of the primary.
Instead he closed ranks with the party to help it win the election
next year.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI will face the most competitive presidential contest in
its history next July, when Labastida will stand against two other
strong candidates, the more conservative Vicente Fox Quesada and
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, who is left-of-center.

   FED RAISES INTEREST RATES ON CONCERN ABOUT INFLATION
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate by a quarter
of a percentage point, to 5.5 percent, saying that the combination
of strong growth and low unemployment had left the economy
vulnerable to inflation. It was the third time this year that the
central bank has raised rates to slow the economy, and the move
clearly signaled that the Fed's growing faith in technology's
ability to improve efficiency and temper inflationary pressures has
its limits.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks jumped as investors bet that the Fed is done with raising
interest rates in the near future. The Dow Jones industrial average
rose 171.58 points, or 1.6 percent, to 10,932.33. The Nasdaq
composite index climbed 73.51 points, or 2.3 percent, to 3,293.05,
and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index increased 25.64 points,
or 1.8 percent, to 1,420.03, a record.
</P>
<P>
   COMCAST TO BUY LENFEST FROM AT&AMP;T
</P>
<P>
   Comcast agreed to buy the cable television company Lenfest
Communications from AT&AMP;T and the Lenfest family for $5.21 billion
in stock, adding 1.25 million subscribers in the Philadelphia area.
AT&AMP;T agreed in May to sell cable systems and provided an option on
others to Comcast in exchange for withdrawing from the bidding for
MediaOne. Class A shares of Comcast rose $2.6875, to $44.

   PFIZER STEPS UP HOSTILE CAMPAIGN

   Pfizer stepped up its effort to acquire Warner-Lambert,
beginning its attempt to oust Warner's board and outlining the

   KENDALL-JACKSON NAMES PLATT CHIEF
</P>
<P>
   For months the speculation was that Lewis Platt, who retires as
chairman of Hewlett-Packard at the end of the year, would join a
venture capital firm, a medical instrument company, or an Internet
start-up. Wrong. Platt will join Kendall-Jackson Wine Estates as
chief executive on Jan. 1.

   GENENTECH SEEN IN PATENT ACCORD
</P>
<P>
   Genentech, the pioneering biotechnology company, has agreed to
settle its long-running patent battle with the University of
California over genetically engineered human growth hormones. The
university's board of regents is scheduled to consider the
agreement this week.
</P>
<P>
   SHIPLEY TO LEAVE CHASE ON JAN. 1
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of Chase Manhattan, Walter Shipley, will retire on
Jan. 1. He will be succeeded by William B. Harrison Jr., the chief
executive of Chase, the nation's third largest bank. Shipley is
leaving 11 months before he reaches the mandatory retirement age of
65. Shipley, who has worked in the banking industry for 43 years,
became chairman in March 1996 after the merger between Chase
Manhattan and Chemical Bank. Under Shipley, Chase's stock has risen
135 percent.

   INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION RISES 0.7 PERCENT
</P>
<P>
   Industrial production climbed a bigger-than-expected
seven-tenths of 1 percent in October, its fastest rate in seven
months, as utilities and factories rebounded from a dip in
September, the Federal Reserve said.
</P>
<P>
   RETAILERS' PROFITS BEAT FORECASTS
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot, Dayton Hudson and Limited reported
better-than-expected third-quarter profits as a strong economy
fueled sales of everything from tools to housewares to clothing.
J.C. Penney said its profit fell 24 percent as it lost shoppers to
low-price stores, but its results still beat revised forecasts by a
penny.

JACKSON ARRESTED IN PROTEST OVER EXPULSIONS IN DECATUR 
</HEADLINE>
  (mcd) 
 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The Rev. Jesse Jackson was arrested Tuesday in a
protest over the expulsion of seven students in the Illinois city
of Decatur for a melee at a football game.
</P>
<P>
   Although the protests have been imbued with the language of the
civil rights movement, the conflict centers less on race than on
the strict zero-tolerance disciplinary policies. Such codes suspend
or expel students for any act of violence and became widely used in
the wake of school shootings in Colorado and Arkansas, among other
places.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has said the issue is not racism, but unfairness in the
school board's expulsion of seven students, all of them black, for
a melee that involved no weapons.
</P>
<P>
   While defenders of such policies say strict rules are needed to
ensure a safe environment for learning, critics say the policies
are often unduly harsh, affect minorities disproportionately and
have led to a soaring expulsion rate that sets many troubled
students adrift.
</P>
<P>
   ``We seem to have this illusion that once a child has been
dropped from school, they simply disappear,'' said Donald Moore,
the executive director of Designs for Change, an education research
organization in Chicago. ``Well, they don't disappear. They're on
the streets, they're shoplifting.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the perception that schools have become violent, Moore
said, the crime rate in classrooms has been falling in recent
years. Between 1993 and 1997, school-related offenses fell to 102
crimes for every 1,000 students, from 155 crimes for every 1,000
students.
</P>
<P>
   But defenders of strict discipline, including many school
administrators, say it is needed for students to learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's critical to have rules and structure so kids know where
they stand,'' said Charles Chieppo, a spokesman for the Pioneer
Institute, a conservative research group in Boston that promotes
charter schools. ``It's especially important to have structure in
schools where many of the students come from homes without much
structure.''
</P>
<P>
   The involvement of Jackson has clearly annoyed many residents of
Decatur, a city of 83,000, with schools that are nearly 40 percent
black. A group of students Tuesday stood with a banner that read,
``Honk if you support the school board.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and school officials met Tuesday morning, but neither
side budged. A few hours later, Jackson slowly pushed his way
though a mob of reporters and cameras to get to the edge of school
property, where he was handcuffed and led away.
</P>
<P>
   School officials have made plain they resent Jackson's presence.
Kenneth Arndt, the school superintendent, told protesters, ``Go
home _ you're definitely not going to get through our doors.''
</P>
<P>
   When Jackson last week vowed to march on the school, officials
canceled classes, fearful of a confrontation. They also met with
Jackson and offered to reduce the initial two-year expulsion for
the students to one year, with an option for the students to begin
attending an alternative school for troubled students immediately.
</P>
<P>
   That offer was rejected by Jackson, who called for the students
to be allowed to return to their own school in January.

WASHINGTON: Arabic,'' he said.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hall said that the authorities would soon bring a large vessel
to the scene that could continue the search, even in rough winter
weather, for human remains and wreckage of the plane. Aviation
experts said that no matter who was in charge, authorities must
still recover more sections of the aircraft from the sea floor.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said that retrieval of the cockpit area would be a
priority. In some previous crashes, information stored in on-board
computer chips yielded valuable data about the condition of the
aircraft in the seconds before impact. Unlike older planes, most
cockpit instruments in the 767 are displayed on video screens that
preserve no information after a crash.
</P>
<P>
   As federal authorities reconstructed the final horrifying
seconds of the flight, safety and law enforcement officials said
that everything was normal on Oct. 31 as the flight reached its
33,000-foot cruising altitude. Then just after 1:49 a.m., things
went terribly wrong in less than 90 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual events began seconds after the pilot, el-Habashy,
briefly left the cockpit, the officials said. The other pilot
repeated quietly and calmly, ``Tawakilt ala Allah,'' according to
the officials. Intelligence officials said that the phrase has no
known connection to any political or terrorist groups.
</P>
<P>
   At about this time someone shut off the autopilot. The officials
said that the voice recorder's cockpit microphones picked up
el-Habashy saying in Arabic, ``What's going on?'' or ``Let's fix
this.'' Seconds later the plane began its steep descent to less
than 17,000 feet. It is unclear at exactly what point in the flight
that the two men spoke, but the flight data recorder showed that 8
seconds after the autopilot was disconnected, the plane began its
plunge.
</P>
<P>
   During the steep dive, the two parts of the tail that control
whether the plane dives or climbs moved in an unusual fashion.
Although in normal flight operations the two parts move in tandem,
investigators said they were initially baffled by the movement of
the left and right parts of the tail in opposite directions. The
officials now hypothesize that one pilot may have been desperately
trying to pull out of the dive while the other pilot was pushing
the plane's controls down. Such an action would overcome the link
that usually moves the two surfaces in tandem and would position
them in opposite ways.
</P>
<P>
   Near the bottom of the dive, someone turned the engine control
levers to the cut off position _ a possible, but not definitive
clue that a struggle was underway in the cockpit that ended when
someone shut down the engines.
</P>
<P>
   After reaching the bottom of its dive, the plane regained
altitude, climbing several thousand feet until it stalled _
reaching a speed too slow to remain airborne. The aircraft then
apparently broke and fell into the Atlantic, killing all 217 people
on board.
</P>
<P>
   The emerging evidence indicates that while recovery operations
will continue at the site of the crash, 60 miles south of
Nantucket, American and Egyptian investigators will compile highly
detailed biographical accounts of the EgyptAir crew members, all of
whom had recently undergone medical and psychological evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, it was unclear whether investigators had gleaned most
of what they expect to extract from the voice and data recorders.
They initially said there was nothing on the tape to indicate a
criminal act. But in more thorough analysis and evaluations by
Arabic speakers, their conclusions have changed dramatically. And
some officials cautioned that further analysis might lead them to
still different theories about the cause of the crash.

DR. KING'S WIDOW TESTIFIES IN A CIVIL TRIAL

<P>
   MEMPHIS _ Coretta Scott King testified before a jury for the
first time Tuesday about the assassination of her husband, the Rev.
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., here 31 years ago. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. King was the first witness in the wrongful death civil
trial of Loyd Jowers, a Memphis cafe owner, who once claimed on
television that he had been part of a conspiracy to kill the civil
rights leader. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. King testified that her family believes the trial might
solve mysteries she believes still surround her husband's death.
``We're concerned with having the truth come out in a court of law
so that it can be documented for all,'' she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages from Jowers and ``unknown
parties.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   James Earl Ray was convicted in the 1968 killing after pleading
guilty in 1969. He later recanted his confession, and spent the
rest of his life trying to get a new trial. Ray died in prison in
1998. His lawyer for the last 10 years of his life, William Pepper,
is representing Mrs. King and her four children in the trial.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, the Kings have embraced Pepper's
theories, which point toward an intricate alleged conspiracy
involving a Memphis produce dealer, the Mafia, the Memphis police
and the Army. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jowers' lawyer, Lewis Garrison, in his opening statement, did
not refute the conspiracy claims, just the extent of his client's
involvement. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some who have studied the King assassination say this trial is
not a sincere effort at finding the truth. &QL;

MODERATE REPUBLICAN GROUP ADMONISHES FORBES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ATTN: Iowa, N.H.)

<P>
   In a dispute that pits Steve Forbes against the Republican
Leadership Council, a moderate group that includes many supporters
of George W. Bush, the Forbes campaign said on Tuesday it would
file a complaint with the Federal Election Commission over
television advertisements by the council that are critical of
Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   The council is airing the advertisements, a spokesman said
Tuesday, because it fears that Forbes will attack other Republican
candidates, as he did Bob Dole in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve Forbes has a track record of running negative ads which
proved, four years ago, to hurt the entire Republican Party,'' said
Mark Miller, executive director of the council, which raises money
for moderate Republicans. ``We do not want to see that happen to
Republicans this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements feature a woman who says that when Forbes ran
in 1996, she ``kind of liked him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But then he spent all his money tearing down his opponents,''
the woman says. ``He hurt the Republican Party.'' After warning
that Forbes ``might start it again,'' the woman says, ``Someone
needs to tell Steve Forbes that if he doesn't have anything nice to
say, don't say anything at all.''
</P>
<P>
   While the council does not endorse candidates, many on its board
are Bush supporters and Miller estimated that 60 to 70 percent of
its members back Bush. Forbes is aligned with the conservative wing
of the party.
</P>
<P>
   A council official, who asked not to be named, said: ``We had
reports that Forbes was going to go with ads critical of Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   But Forbes has no attack advertisements on the air. He is
currently running three commercials _ one promoting his views on
taxes, another on Social Security and the third is biographical.
They do not mention any other candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes campaign said it would file a complaint saying that
the council's $100,000 advertising campaign represents an ``excess
contribution'' to the Bush campaign. The council said the ads are
not campaign contributions, but ``issue advocacy'' advertising,
which are permitted by federal law as long as they do not directly
advocate the election or defeat of a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The advertising is airing in Iowa, New Hampshire and Washington
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the advertisements Tuesday on the Today show,
Bush said he had not seen them, nor read about them.
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican candidate, John McCain, sent a letter to the
council criticizing the advertising as a violation of campaign
finance law and urged that it be halted. ``I do not believe that
either Steve Forbes or his campaign have conducted themselves in
such a matter as to require your admonishment,'' he said.

INDIAN COLLEGE FOR THE ARTS FACES LOSS OF U.S. MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mcd) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. _ As a White Earth Chippewa, now 59 years old,
Catherine Ryker grew tired of minimum wage jobs and wanted to
become an art teacher. So she enrolled here in the Institute for
American Indian Arts, the only college of its kind in the country,
where Indians teach art and culture to Indians as a way to preserve
their ethnic heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter Jessie Ryker-Crawford, a former waitress who is 37,
has the same ambitions. On any given day, she sits beside her
mother in painting and drawing classes.
</P>
<P>
   But years from now, it remains a lingering question to Ms.
Ryker-Crawford, as well as to faculty members and other students at
the institute, whether Ms. Ryker-Crawford's children, Jason, who is
10, and Tonya, 7, will have the same opportunity as their mother
and grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say the budget now being finalized in Congress will
be the last to include support for the institute, $2.12 million for
2000. As a federally chartered two-year college now under the aegis
of the Interior Department, it has received taxpayer dollars since
opening as a high school in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the college has produced scores of artists,
curators and tribal leaders _ graduates who have earned higher
degrees, some of whom have helped Indian art become a $500 million
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ralph Regula of Ohio, chairman of the Interior
appropriation subcommittee, has vowed to end all federal support
for the institute. He insisted he has ``no personal animus'' for
the college.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've spent a lot of money on Indian culture, in many
different ways,'' he said by telephone from Washington. ``It comes
to a point, do you assume it's in perpetuity or do you develop a
program that's self-sufficient?''
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee decision has stung students, staff and faculty,
fueling bitterness and, as some see it, reinforcing an image of
American Indians as a throw-away culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't hate them for their beliefs of who native people
are,'' Ms. Ryker-Crawford said. ``But there are a lot of
misconceptions. It angers me, but it saddens me more. I've never
seen students and staff work so hard in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Others took sharper aim at lawmakers. ``What they're saying is
that this school isn't valid; our culture isn't valid,'' said Mary
Young Bear, a Meskwaki from Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The institute's loss of federal support comes as administrators
are fighting to fulfill Regula's vision of a college that has a
broader appeal, offering a greater variety of courses in a more
spacious setting. A local business group has donated 140 acres for
a new campus.
</P>
<P>
   But growth has been a struggle. Annual enrollment remained
around 220 for a decade through the early 1990s. Then, the budget
cuts and management problems forced administrators to lay off more
than half the faculty and staff, which affected recruiting. This
year, about 135 students, who pay annual tuition of $10,000, take
classes from 11 full-time teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Construction has begun on buildings that will allow the college
to double its enrollment at the new location. Private donations,
like a recent $3 million gift from the American Indian College
Fund, are helping.
</P>
<P>
   But Della Warrior, president of the college, says she worries
that further belt-tightening could affect the quality of education
the college provides and discourage enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he really recognizes how integral art and
culture are to native American people to make a living and give
them future potential,'' Ms. Warrior said of Regula. ``Unless we
get major endowments and gifts, I don't see how we can continue to
operate.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Lomahaftewa, a Hopi-Choctaw and a well-known American
Indian artist, was one of the institute's first students. After
receiving a master of fine arts degree from the San Francisco Art
Institute, she returned in 1976 to teach and remains on the
faculty.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me,'' she said of the federal budget cuts and the lawmakers
who enact them, ``this is like another broken treaty. Native
peoples have always been guaranteed education and health, but then
the programs are all cut back. They don't recognize native people
for who we are, America's first people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look how we're treated,'' she added. `'We take 10 steps
forward, then 20 steps back. To me, nothing has changed.''

A CENTURY OF PARTNERING BY AN ART AND A MEDIUM  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 21) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There could be little argument that ``A Celebration
of 100 Years of American Dance on Film'' was one of the most wildly
improbable dance events of 1999. But the program also suggested
profound changes in the nature of dance in America, and in the
relationship between dance and the electronic media.
</P>
<P>
   The two-hour event, presented in mid-October at the Juilliard
Theater, scampered from late 19th-century films by Thomas Edison of
antic and elegant black dancing to the cool hyper-acrobatics of
Elizabeth Streb in the 1990s. Blurring the distinction between art
and archive, the program featured mainstream film dance and
recorded dance, from early film experimentation with movement to
dance filmed for television.
</P>
<P>
   The film and video clips represented an adroit balancing of
social and theatrical dance, and of anecdote and history, by the
dance writer Marian Horosko and the Broadway choreographer and
director Donald Saddler, who put the program together with Theodore
S. Bartwink, the executive director of the sponsoring Harkness
Foundation for Dance.
</P>
<P>
   The event was also sponsored by the Dance Collection of the New
York Public Library for the Performing Arts. But what, as some in
the audience asked at the end, was it all in aid of?
</P>
<P>
   One of the great pleasures of ``A Celebration of 100 Years of
American Dance on Film'' was its rag-bag nature. The scraps got
decidedly less vivid and consequential toward the end, when Ms.
Horosko and Saddler seemed suddenly to feel that there was a
balance sheet to be filled with the names of all the worthy dance
enterprises of the 1980s and '90s.
</P>
<P>
   But there were gorgeous scraps of bright silk and nubbly wool to
be plucked from that bag in the first half of the evening, which
brought the program into the 1950s. The sheer volume and range of
dance represented in more than 70 film and video clips and
photographs was stunning. ``We've done so much,'' one dance
aficionado said simply as he left the theater.
</P>
<P>
   A century ago, ballet was the only show in town. But it was a
foreign show, a matter mostly of exotic imports. There were few
American-born ballet stars and until the 1930s no ballet companies
founded by Americans. Modern dance was born, in America and Europe,
a decade or so into the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the pioneers and major artists who made all this
possible were represented in ``A Celebration.'' There were also
rich revelatory glimpses of less familiar artists like the
modern-dance choreographer Helen Tamiris and the German
Expressionist Harald Kreutzberg. A purported Isadora Duncan wafted
among columns at an apparent garden party.
</P>
<P>
   And footage of solemn young women in 1930s classes at the
Bennington School of Dance, the forerunner of the American Dance
Festival, affirmed the do-or-die seriousness of the enterprise of
American modern dance a few decades later.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Celebration'' gave equal time to popular dance, from
ballroom and dancing parties to artists that ranged the hilarious
vaudeville artist Joe Frisco to James Cagney, a dancer of
exhilaratingly casual grace. Only in recent years, however, with
the elevation of indigenous and popular dance to high art, would a
performer like Frisco be considered an artist.
</P>
<P>
   There were hoedowns as choreographed by Michael Kidd in the 1954
film musical ``Seven Brides for Seven Brothers'' and as danced,
with charming sedateness, by Eleanor Roosevelt with young soldiers.
Frisco's gyrating legs and ground-hugging moves could be seen in
Bob Fosse's ``Steam Heat'' and in a Michael Jackson music video.
</P>
<P>
   A beautifully photographed film view of Bill ``Bojangles''
Robinson, that stage and film star of the 1920s and '30s, attested
to the technique and artistry of tap, reiterated in video of a
1990s performance by the Brooklyn-based Young Hoofers.
</P>
<P>
   The glories of film dance as conceived by Busby Berkeley and
Fred Astaire, whose ideas about dance and film were in themselves
so suggestively different, are a world apart from the cool,
deceptively dispassionate evocations of dance that survive from the
heyday of the Public Broadcasting System series ``Dance in
America'' in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Dance was once considered a comfortable part of popular culture,
at least in film. Anna Pavlova played a major role in a 1915
Hollywood-produced silent feature film. The dancing of the Nicholas
Brothers helped sell film musicals, and dance was the whole point
of film musicals by Berkeley, Astaire and Gene Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   Every major American city may have its own ballet troupe today,
and often a few modern-dance groups as well, but as Kidd has
pointed out, choreography in today's mass-market films is mostly a
matter of the staging of shoot-'em-ups in action movies.
</P>
<P>
   Ballet was once filled with glamorous international stars, many
of whom were shown in ``A Celebration.'' That era has ended for
dance, paradoxically in a time when American culture has become
increasingly driven by larger-than-life personalities. The program
offered other reasons to mourn, among them the loss of the Joffrey
Ballet as the major and frequent rescuer of lost glories like
``Parade'' and ``The Green Table.''
</P>
<P>
   Public television is no longer able to afford the kind of
comprehensive recording of modern American dance history
exemplified by ``Dance in America.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also an increasing closeness between the dance and the
electronic media of film, video and, now, computer-generated
imagery. The use of film as a decorative component of live dance is
certainly not new. And the haunting ``Poem for the Theater No. 6,''
revived in September by Beverly Blossom, suggests that the
integration of dance and film was being imaginatively explored in
the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   But seldom has electronic imagery been used with such
sophistication and profundity as in Merce Cunningham's ``Biped,''
presented this summer at the Lincoln Center Festival, and in the
central solo of Pina Bausch's ``Danzon,'' performed earlier this
month at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
</P>
<P>
   Electronically produced imagery were one with the movement,
intimately extending and reinforcing the central themes of the
choreography and of the essential, defining physicality of dance.
The appropriation of dance by film, as an equal partner in the
production of art and entertainment, was a glorious part of ``A
Celebration of 100 Years of American Dance.'' Today, perhaps, it is
dance that is appropriating film.

DEFENDANT TAKES STAND IN EAST TEXAS DRAGGING DEATH CASE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ A pale but clear-speaking Shawn Allen Berry
testified Tuesday that he initially lied to investigators about
running away when a black man was chained to his pickup because he
wrongly believed that merely being at the scene made him guilty of
murder.
</P>
<P>
   Insisting that he was now telling the truth, Berry admitted
driving James Byrd Jr., 49, out to a remote logging road with two
avowed white supremacists to drink beer. But Berry said he tried to
intervene when the other two attacked Byrd, then backed off and
offered no more help to Byrd because of ``paralyzing fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, when the battered victim was pushed toward Berry at one
point, he was able to jump out of the way by ``human nature,'' the
24-year-old cinema manager said during cross examination.
</P>
<P>
   Berry's is the third capital murder trial to stem from a 1998
torture slaying that has rocked this East Texas community of 7,100.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Ku Klux Klansmen John William King Jr., 25,
and Lawrence Russell Brewer, 32, were convicted and sentenced to
death for chaining Byrd behind a pickup and dragging him three
miles along a bumpy rural road.
</P>
<P>
   Closing arguments in Berry's trial are expected today.
</P>
<P>
   Berry testified that while guzzling beer and cruising at 2:30
a.m. on June 7, 1998, he didn't think King posed a danger to Byrd
because his friend's threats and big talk over the years were never
followed up with action.
</P>
<P>
   Berry said that at one point he rushed between Byrd, who was
sitting in the passenger seat, and King, who was reaching in from
outside the truck. At that point, King warned Berry that he could
face the same fate if he tried to intervene, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Berry backed off, taking his friend's threat seriously because
King was now following through and actually assaulting someone, he
said. Fear paralyzed him, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't do anything more to stop it,'' Berry said, pausing
a moment with his head down before adding: ``I couldn't move. I've
never been in a position where I couldn't move before.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the most emotional turn of his 41/2 hours of testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Berry spoke evenly, not losing composure when District Attorney
Guy James Gray expressed disbelief in his account and noted
inconsistencies. Berry was polite in his responses and referred
unerringly to the victim as ``Mr. Byrd.''
</P>
<P>
   In the high-ceiling courtroom, the defendant wore a white shirt
and muted pinstripe shirt. He had neat, close-cropped hair and a
pale baby face. Gone were the scruffy goatee and unruly hair shown
in his jail-house mug shot. His clothing covered several tattoos
but, unlike those of King and Brewer, they carried no racist
symbolism.
</P>
<P>
   The youthful-looking defendant testified about his star-crossed
life. His biological parents never married and he hadn't met his
Ohioan father until two weeks ago. Whereabouts of his mother,
described as wild, are unknown.
</P>
<P>
   His stepfather committed suicide when Berry was 17. He ran away
from an overbearing step-grandmother and dropped out of school
before completing 9th grade. At 17, he was arrested with King while
burglarizing a vending machine company and spent 90 days in jail
boot camp.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested in the Byrd slaying two months before he was to
wed a former beauty queen and the mother of his 2-year-old son, who
had twice filed, then disavowed, domestic violence charges against
him.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney noted that Berry used the pronoun ``we''
45 times in his statements to investigators about the killing, but
in a ``60 Minutes II'' interview and on the stand, he used the word
``they.'' Berry said he always used ``they'' but contended that
interrogators who wrote out his accounts employed the word ``we.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry insisted that no one smoked at the scene where Byrd was
beaten and chained behind the pickup, and that cigarette butts
found with the DNA of the three whites apparently fell out of the
truck's ashtray at some point.
</P>
<P>
   Gray later said to reporters that butts found close to a circle
of Byrd's blood suggested that all three participated. Berry, while
not an avowed racist like the other two whites, might have been
drawn in by the sheer emotional force of a ``pack'' attacking its
prey, a variation of a thrill-seeking murder, Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor also questioned whether Berry was so scared that
he ``wet his pants,'' as the defendant testified. Under
cross-examination, Berry said he nonetheless continued to wear the
same sodden Polo jeans and underwear until the next afternoon. An
FBI forensic expert testified earlier for the prosecution that he
detected only a ``dribble'' of urine on the jeans.

<P>
   But it's a comedy record in the sense that intelligent directors
make comedy films: it's one big aesthetic disposition, rather than
the series of bulletlike jokes on what are commonly called comedy
records by the likes of Adam Sandler and Chris Rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Midnite Vultures'' is funny without making actual jokes. (It's
last track, ``Debra,'' is the only song with something resembling a
narrative.) Beck has a pitch-perfect ear for pop-music convention,
but ``Midnite Vultures'' presents a kaleidoscope of folly; it
doesn't stand still long enough to make single punch lines.
</P>
<P>
   If it had to be compared to a particular film comedy, it might
be Quentin Tarantino's ``Pulp Fiction,'' with its vivid language,
cartoonish exaggerations, sendups of eroticism and self-importance
and sequences of script and action that leave your jaw hanging.
</P>
<P>
   ``Midnite Vultures'' (Geffen DGC 0694904852) is inscribed with
all of the above. And as with that movie, there are bound to be
critics soon accusing Beck of racialist caricature; he has never
gone so far before in the direction of mockery.
</P>
<P>
   But here, at last, is a rock star who is using irony the right
way. His appropriations from pop history are so precise that he
forces you to admire, rather than snicker at, the materials he is
working with.
</P>
<P>
   If you're going to satirize something, one can assume that
there's something good in it, and through Beck's junk-shop overlay
of nonsense rhymes and funny sounds, you can feel the grooves; you
know he's paying respect. Above all this hovers a thesis that you
don't feel Beck is pushing on you, but it's there: most American
pop musicians these days, whatever their skin tone, are all in
pursuit of the same archetypes of sound and character. Race, as a
definer of what sort of song a person should sing, is more
meaningless than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, to be too hung up on this issue _ which really leaps out
at you by the album's fifth track, ``Hollywood Freaks'' _ is to
ignore what the album accomplishes. ``Midnite Vultures'' is a
ricochet ride through American pop from around 1975 to around 1995
(he seems to hesitate at lampooning the present), and somehow it
all arrives with one man's stamp.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Beck Hansen got to ``Odelay,'' his commercial and
critical breakthrough of 1996 in his mid 20s, he had created his
own style _ blithe, capricious folk songs joined to hip-hop
backbeats, with his messily-played acoustic guitar roughing up the
edges and shrewd samples offering the listener a thousand paths to
follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mutations,'' from last year, took a left turn _ a mellower
mood, no samples and a few songs straightforward enough to be
covered by other, less pointedly ironic singers. But ``Midnite
Vultures'' makes all that came before sound primitive.
</P>
<P>
   You put on ``Midnite Vultures'' and you laugh, but what are you
laughing about? Is it karaoke-show laughter? Beck keeps a running
list of pop styles you haven't thought about for years, creating
loving quasi-parodies that enhance your memory of the styles and
thereby makes any casual radio listener over 25 feel like a
connoisseur. (You recognize them as styles, not as particular
songs: there's the slow-rolling mid-'90s West Coast funk in
``Hollywood Freaks,'' the robotic electro of Kraftwerk and Zapp in
``Get Real Paid,'' the voluptuous, passe beats of Tone Loc in
``Pressure Zone,'' the Mick Jaggerish falsetto in ``Debra''.)
</P>
<P>
   Is it a nervous laughter? Beck seems self-aware enough to
realize the danger in playing with stereotype yet still goes ahead
and appropriates some of Prince's most flamboyant musical gestures.
Or are you laughing because Beck is a Roberto Benigni-type _ a guy
with such strong charisma that he can't move a muscle without
seeming funny?
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To get a better reading on Beck, we have to look at what's
around him. This has been a year of style-swapping in what we used
to refer to as the categories of black and white music. Many of the
new R-and-B songs by black artists are held together by
acoustic-guitar lines that sound lifted from James Taylor albums.
</P>
<P>
   Garth Brooks made a record (``Chris Gaines: Greatest Hits'')
that is more in keeping with black radio than any of Kid Rock's
kitschy pimp posturing. The white rap-metal bands Limp Bizkit and
Korn have gone multiplatinum by refashioning hip-hop as
stressed-out cries for help; they're using psychosis to try to top
their favorite music's boasts and beats.
</P>
<P>
   Beck's own mission of appropriation is broad, knowing, a little
bit sly. He doesn't have to worry about whether a certain phrase or
style fits his persona, because his is a persona of accretion, a
thousand voices bottled inside one guy's throat.
</P>
<P>
   There's a (italics)huge(end italics) amount of information
passing before your ears on ``Midnite Vultures.'' Produced by Beck
(with contributions from the Dust Brothers, Mickey Petralia and
Tony Hoffer), the album has sonic depth; with its samples and
background vocals and overlaid rhythms, it approximates the
experience of gazing at a stained-glass window.
</P>
<P>
   Beck has taken cheesiness-spotting to previously unscaled
heights: he revels in outdated rhythm-machine sounds, ``Sanford and
Son'' keyboards, an electronically altered chipmunk-voice asking
``do you want to feel this?'' But where all that ought to sound
shallow, he sees a greater purpose for it. He turns the details
into great pop: it makes you move, makes you sing.
</P>
<P>
   (This record will be a favorite at parties for a long time; some
of its choruses are as strong as any in pop.) He seems to want to
keep showing you how some cultural appropriation is natural and how
some is artificial, and puts both examples next to each other as
often as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Beck is a slippery character. He seems to have a congenital
horror of appearing pretentious. (Last year, when he was still
making the album, he said that he was avoiding end-of-millennium
bombast by making a ``big, dumb pop record with dumb lyrics.'') He
never seems altogether serious about anything, but he knows a great
deal about what he doesn't want to be.
</P>
<P>
   So he doesn't invest his persona in any particular style; he's a
master at undercutting the grandeur of his own grand gestures.
Throughout ``Midnite Vultures,'' he'll be at work on a fairly
straightforward lyrical image or an acceptably soulful musical
gesture and then something steps in the way _ a word he thinks
hilarious, like ``garbageman'' or ``hot dog,'' a silly effect like
a psychedelic guitar squiggle. He'll throw a phrase at you that
seems to signify, then you realize it's just an exercise in trying
on someone else's voice.
</P>
<P>
   But as the best film comedies deal with something of substance
on a lower level _ middle-age unhappiness in ``Groundhog Day,''
delusions of grandeur in ``Rushmore,'' the tangle of American
interracial antagonism and jealousy in ``Pulp Fiction'' _ so does
``Midnite Vultures.''
</P>
<P>
   The substance is the funk, which is real; whatever Beck sings,
he sounds persuasive. He's working on a new paradigm in popular
entertainment: an ironist who serves the public instead of himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to know if I'm worth your time,'' he pleads in ``Get
Real Paid,'' and wouldn't you know, he seems to mean it.

 By JOYCE WADLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ We would have to get to this eventually, so we might
as well get it out of the way now. The sibling rivalry thing.
</P>
<P>
   Ric Burns is the filmmaker who directed ``New York: A
Documentary Film,'' a 12-hour series on the history of New York,
which is being shown on the public broadcasting system this week.
He is the younger brother of Ken Burns, the better known
documentary filmmaker who gave us ``Baseball'' and ``The Civil
War.'' How do they get along?
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother lives in New Hampshire,'' Burns says.
</P>
<P>
   OK. But are they close?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in a funny way. We're both so involved in our work. He
has an office in New York across from mine. We can go four months
without seeing each other. You can't not be close if you grow up in
the same room and are 18 months apart, but we're each reasonably
willful people and have in some ways gone our own way.''
</P>
<P>
   He seizes on something that sums it up, and which, in happy
addition, has to do with the subject he is trying to promote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Philip Lopate had a great expression we used in the film. He
said New Yorkers cultivate a benign indifference for each other.
That's the way Ken and I are right now. It's kind of good to be
left alone and do what you each do. Like New Yorkers say: `Don't be
my friend. Leave me alone. Do whatever it is you want to do. Other
than that, get out of my face.'''
</P>
<P>
   Is it a surprise that a filmmaker who spends 12 hours on a
subject cannot give you a short, snappy, answer? Ric Burns, 44, who
spent many years pursuing a Ph.D., cannot respond to anything in a
cursory manner. His, you might say, is the graduate student style:
The way he dresses (blue work shirt and chinos) the way he comes at
a subject (more than you need to know, orally foot-noted, but
fascinating). Even his apartment, where his wife, Bonnie, a former
Canadian Broadcasting Corp. journalist, is amusing their young son,
Simon, is in student country, near Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a Burns _ actually a Burns brothers _ documentary
style: sepia photo stills; period film clips, evocatively spotted
or faded; boldface names for narrators. Ken Burns went into the
business first, bringing Ric in later. (The younger Burns was the
co-producer of ``The Civil War.'') Since 1990, Ric Burns has worked
with other partners on several critically acclaimed documentaries,
including ``Coney Island'' and ``The Way West.'' ``New York,''
which Burns directed, co-produced (with Lisa Ades) and wrote (with
James Sanders), is his most ambitious project.
</P>
<P>
   ``It emerged out of a conversation James and I had 10 years ago,
when we got drunk in the Algonquin,'' Burns says. ``I had been
struck, ever since reading Robert Caro, with the idea that a city
could be a story. What was so remarkable was to discover there
 &UR; was &LR;  a story, the story of capitalism and democracy rising in
America. The Dutch came here not to practice religious freedom, but
to get rich, and because of that they didn't have any rules for
excluding people.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference between a Ric Burns documentary and a Ken Burns
documentary?
</P>
<P>
   Younger siblings, he said, probably ``tend to market themselves
as gloomier and more brooding.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued, ``Ken is more attracted to stories that are
eventually triumphant: the Brooklyn Bridge. I was more interested
in the Donner Party: darker, more catastrophic.''
</P>
<P>
   The spelling of Burns' first name isn't an adorable affectation.
His given name is Eric, but his family called him Ric. Burns'
father was an anthropologist and professor at the University of
Delaware, as well as ``an obsessive photographer''; his mother was
a biologist. Ric Burns brings out a visual, a carefully preserved
issue of the National Geographic from 1959. It contains the one
story his father ever published, about an Alpine village in France.
There is also a picture of Burns' mother, holding Ken, who was then
2. She was given a diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer when Ric
Burns was 3, and she died when he was 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, Ken and I were constructed twins,'' Burns says. ``I
think because my mother knew she was dying, my parents were very
eager to bring me along as rapidly as they could. My mother taught
me to read at 4, I skipped second grade and went into the same
grade as Ken.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, I found myself literally behind Ken. The most
ludicrous thing is a series of photographs of us in little gray
short pants and red bow ties. I think what we now know about child
rearing, they should have dressed Ken in purple corduroy and me in
orange plaid. It would have been better for individuation.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns had planned an academic life. He received a B.A. in
English literature from Columbia, a master's degree in philosophy
from Cambridge. Eventually, however, he found the academic world
claustrophobic. His brother invited him to work with him on ``The
Civil War.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked together five years,'' Burns says. ``If you wanted
to go to the best university and learn how to make a film, go and
make a film with my brother. It was the greatest experience in the
world, but having gone through it, you would not want to not
control the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ken is not going to work for me and I'm not going to work for
him. Unfortunately, that rules out, for the near term,
collaboration. Though maybe each of us will change. It would be
interesting.''

11-16 -- America and Dr. Peter F. Drucker have fallen out of favor
with each other. Drucker still has his disciples, but at the
bleeding edge of business the old master's lifework is commonly
seen as simplistic, portentous, off the mark, idealistic, out of

cancer, near the end of the runway at the former South Weymouth
Naval Air Station, about 600 yards from his house. The EPA says the
station is contaminated with volatile organic compounds and heavy

called Primative Neuroectodermal Tumor and in remission after two
years of treatment, suspects a link to increased cancer rates in
the area. (Tom Herde/Boston Globe Photo)

School, have been treated for leukemia. They are, from left, Kim
Tolnar, class of '82, Jami Cummings, class of '93, and Amanda

11-16 -- Range Officer Glen Morin walks past UXOs (Unexploded
Ordinance) of mortar and anti-tank rounds on the firing range at
the Massachusetts Military Reservation. The EPA closed the range to
artillery and mortar fire in 1997. An estimated 50 million acres of
land in the United States have been used as bombing and target
ranges by the military. Cleaning up just five percent of the land
would cost $15 billion, according to the Defense Science Board, a
Pentagon advisory group. (Tom Herde/Boston Globe Photo)

COMMENTARY: LIVING LA LOCA TRUMPA 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABOARD AIR TRUMP _ Melania Knauss pulls up her black Calvin
Klein sheath to show off her supermodel knees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never wear skirts this long,'' says the girlfriend of Donald
Trump, with a pretty grimace, standing in the aisle of his plane,
stocked with gilt fixtures, French impressionist paintings, a
double bed and the creme-filled finger cookies the real estate king
decrees ``the greatest.''
</P>
<P>
   But politics requires sacrifices. And Monday's trip to Miami was
a dress rehearsal for Trump's potential White House bid. So the
amiable Miss Knauss was doing her bit, wearing conservative gray
and black Calvins chosen by a publicist for the Trump modeling
agency. But the Slovenian's stilettos by Manolo Blahnik gave her
away as someone blissfully unfamiliar with rope lines.
</P>
<P>
   Trump was making his maiden foreign policy speech to
Cuban-Americans who adore his Castro-bashing. ``I'd have,
personally, two words for him: `Adios, amigo!''' he told a large,
cheering crowd, adding that he wanted the first hotel in free Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The flirtation of the Trumpster, as he calls himself, is the
apotheosis of our Gilded Age. Our politics is warped by money,
celebrity, polling and crass behavior, and our culture is defined
by stock-market high-rolling, boomer narcissism, niche marketing
mania, rankings and a quiz show called ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Regis,'' Trump says.
</P>
<P>
   Why shouldn't billionaires play ``Who Wants to Be a President?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already got my own airplane,'' he says. ``We could save
money on Air Force One.''
</P>
<P>
   You gotta love a guy whose economic platform runs all of a page
and a half and is a $5.7 trillion squeeze-the-rich tax plan that
would make the Donald at least $750 million poorer. And there are
more provocative plans to come.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, given so many years of Trump plastering Trump on every
available surface, the builder and casino owner actually looked a
bit shy when he saw the Trump 2000 posters, with his own pouty
kisser staring back, and Cuban-American fans at the Bay of Pigs
Museum yelling ``Viva Donald Trump!''
</P>
<P>
   He gave a tentative wave to his first rope line, but soon
recovered enough to note that Steve Forbes never had so many
cameras at the airport or a supermodel by his podium.
</P>
<P>
   Trump does not live an examined life. He lives a quantified
life. He keeps track of all numbers, the sentinels of success _ the
number of magazine covers his girlfriend is on this month and the
number of men who are dripping with lust for her; the number of
zoning changes he has finagled; the number of stories he was able
to stack on his building near the United Nations; the huge amount
of money he was paid to do a clever ad for an online company, in
which he looks down a girl's shirt, and the short amount of time it
took him to do it; the number of favorable mentions in a Palm Beach
publication about a club he has started at Mar-a-Lago; the number
of working-class guys who call out to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am just very popular with the black populace,'' he says.
``When Puff Daddy has a party, when Russell Simmons has a party,
I'm the person they call.''
</P>
<P>
   He uses a kind of ego arithmetic. About the candidates, he
demands: ``Did they make billions of dollars in a short period of
time? No. Could they ...? No.'' And: ``Hey, look, what's so good
about these people? I do `Face the Nation,' `Meet the Press,'
`Larry King.' I think I do better than they do. They're boring as
hell. They get no ratings and everybody turns off the set.''
</P>
<P>
   He refers to W. as the anointed ``son of the president who
should have finished the war'' and says he looks ``vacuous.'' He
thinks Bill Bradley is ``not exactly Cary Grant.'' Al Gore has made
``dreadful mistakes,'' including Alpha Girl.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of his first day as an exploratory guy, Trump was
very tired. Almost too tired to brag. But he rallied enough at
midnight, in a limo from the airport back to Trump Tower, to check
out a big poster with his name on it and to muse about how much of
Third Avenue he had built.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the only difference between me and the other
candidates,'' he summed up, ``is that I'm more honest and my women
are more beautiful.''

MEN IN COCKPIT OF EGYPTAIR 990 HAD SOLID EXPERIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (With AIRCRASH, moved in `w' news file) 
 (nk) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ As EgyptAir Flight 990 left New York's Kennedy
Airport shortly after midnight on Oct. 31, the three men in the
cockpit of the Boeing 767 covered a wide spectrum, and each
appeared to have solid credentials.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, Ahmed el-Habashy, 57, was a family man who had two
wives, three children and a 26-year career spent entirely with
EgyptAir. The co-pilot, Adel Anwar, 36, was single, and had flown
for the airline for just five years. He was hurrying home to Cairo
to prepare for a marriage planned for the coming Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The third man, Gamil al-Batouti, 59, was not at the controls but
sitting in an observer's seat. He was nearing the customary
retirement age of 60, and was to end his career in March.
</P>
<P>
   Less than an hour into the flight, however, something went
wrong, and investigators are now concentrating their efforts on
determining whether it was Batouti, the veteran pilot who had
trained many of his country's pilots, who set into motion the
events that ultimately brought the plane crashing into the ocean,
killing all 217 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have said that they have identified
Batouti's voice as that of the person in the co-pilot's seat, the
person who is heard on the cockpit voice recorder making a
reference to God. Investigators now strongly suspect that Batouti,
shortly after the plane's pilot briefly left the cockpit, then
initiated a set of actions that sent the plane into a dive.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have cautioned that they are far from reaching
conclusions, and they have acceded to the wishes of the Egyptian
government that the voice recorder be analyzed further and that the
significance of the reference to God be interpreted more fully.
Certainly no one has offered any reason why Batouti or any other
member of the crew would have wanted to crash the plane.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference last week, Mohammed Fahim Rayan, the
chairman of EgyptAir, said that both the pilot and co-pilot,
habashy and Anwar, had been pronounced fit within the past five
months after undergoing what Rayan called rigorous psychological
checkups within the past five months. The airline executive was not
asked directly about Batouti, whose name surfaced as the focus of
the investigations only early Tuesday in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   But Rayan said that all pilots and other crew members are
required to submit to the test as part of an annual procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Relatively little is at the moment known about the crew members
aboard, including Batouti. Batouti was married with E five
children, the eldest of whom was 21. He was scheduled to retire on
March 4, when he would have turned 60, and had been ``a little
depressed'' at the fact that he had never been promoted to captain,
according to Mark Abdelazim, a concierge at a Manhattan apartment
building who had befriended Batouti, as well as other EgyptAir
pilots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard not to have made it, but he was a happy person,''
Abdelazim said.
</P>
<P>
   Batouti, a former Air Force aviation instructor who joined
EgyptAir only in 1987, had told friends that Flight 990 would be
his last before retirement, according a report Tuesday in the
Egyptian newspaper Al Akhbar.
</P>
<P>
   Batouti was seated in the cockpit along with habashy and Anwar
at the time of takeoff, according to Abdelazim Sedki, who is
director of media and marketing for EgyptAir. But habashy and Anwar
were acting as pilot and co-pilot, while Batouti was sitting in one
of two observer's seats, Sedki said.
</P>
<P>
   Only two men are required to pilot a 767, under standard
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to habashy, Anwar and Battouti, the Egyptair crew
members traveling on the plane included five other qualified
pilots, three of whom were simply hitching a ride back to the
airline's home base.
</P>
<P>
   In all public statements so far, EgyptAir officials have said
they saw no reason to suspect wrongdoing by any of the assigned
pilots. At the news conference last week, Rayan, the chairman of
the state-run airline, said that Habashy had been declared to fit
to fly on Oct. 10 and that Anwar had passed his most recent exam,
sometime last summer.
</P>
<P>
   In requiring that the pilots and other crew members undergo
annual tests, Rayan insisted, the airline treats employees in
sensitive positions with the same kind of prudence that it does
bomb threats. ``They have to be checked,'' Rayan said.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming days, investigators will be seeking to learn
everything they can about Batouti, as well as the other crew
members. Family members will be interviewed. Flying records will be
checked. For the moment, though, investigators have no solid notion
of why Batouti might have taken the action they think the voice and
data recorders indicate he did.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed Wasef, a cook at a restaurant near the Manhattan hotel
where many EgyptAir pilots stayed when in New York, said he had
known Batouti casually. He said Batouti had brought his wife and
young daughter to the United States early last summer in an efort
to get medical care for the young girl.
</P>
<P>
   Wasef said he was aware of Batouti's pending retirement, but
that he had seen him briefly the day of the flight and noticed
nothing remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was willing to live another life of doing nothing but
taking care of other business,'' Wasef said. ``He had plans.''

IN SEEKING MANNESMANN, VODAFONE CONTEMPLATES 2-TIER STRATEGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Brushing aside a legal challenge to its advisers and
the rejection of a $106.4-billion offer over the weekend, the
mobile phone giant Vodafone Airtouch PLC said Tuesday that it would
present a sweetened bid for Mannesmann AG later this week, and was
prepared to make a hostile move on the German company if that
failed.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, sensing that a hostile bid was looming, drove down
Vodafone's stock price in heavy trading more than 7 percent, to
2.7175 pounds, or $4.40. But Mannesmann's shares soared intraday to
2.175 euros _ 14.5 euros above Vodafone's previous offering price _
before falling back to end the day's trading in Frankfurt at 207.65
euros, or $214.46.
</P>
<P>
   The market behavior of the two stocks presented Vodafone chief
executive Christopher Gent with what analysts regarded as a tricky
choice. A takeover of Mannesmann would make Vodafone _ already the
global wireless leader _ one of the world's biggest
telecommunications companies with dominance in Europe's
fast-growing wireless market and powerful positions in the United
States and the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
   But the cost could make that sort of move perilous, since a
slide in Vodafone's stock price would render a hostile bid more
expensive and would risk alienating its own investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weaker Vodafone Airtouch shares are, the deeper it will
have to dig and the less attractive the deal will look to its
existing shareholders,'' said Nigel Hawkins, an analyst with the
brokerage firm Williams de Broe. ``It's a desperately difficult
decision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Wight, an analyst with Commerzbank in London, said a
hostile bid was ``not going to be very pretty in the near term, but
the strategic rationale for doing it is so strong that it's the
price they may feel they have to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a fear that Vodafone will have to pay a heavy
premium,'' said John Jensen of Salomon Smith Barney. ``If their bid
doesn't succeed, it'll be negative, and if it does and it's too
expensive, that will be negative, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone and Mannesmann have been partners for years in Germany,
Italy and France. But when the German company reached an agreement
to acquire Orange PLC, Britain No. 3 wireless operator, last month,
it became a competitor on Vodafone's home territory. Gent
complained at a news conference Tuesday that Mannesmann had not
consulted him about that deal.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann's $33 billion purchase of Orange led to speculation
that a hostile bid by Vodafone was imminent, particularly after
Mannesmann rejected the $106.4 billion proposal made Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   As the battle intensified, Mannesmann sought a High Court
injunction preventing Vodafone's main advisers, the Wall Street
powerhouse Goldman, Sachs, the leading investment banker in Europe,
from advising it. Goldman's objections to an injunction are to be
heard Thursday and it has voluntarily suspended its service until
then.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Tuesday, Gent argued that a combination of
Vodafone and Mannesmann had ``compelling logic'' because it would
mean control of Europe's biggest wireless markets with 30 million
customers and would create savings of $800 million in 2003 and $970
million in 2004.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While Vodafone's initial bid was made directly to Mannesmann
chief executive Klaus Esser, Gent said a new bid would be presented
to Mannesmann's supervisory board Friday.
</P>
<P>
   German supervisory boards include labor representatives,
managers and outside directors, and they set the broad outlines of
company policy. Vodafone executives indicated that they believed an
approach to Mannesmann's supervisory board might elicit a more
sympathetic response than Esser's outright rejection of the earlier
offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would hope that the supervisory board sees the logic of
putting the businesses together,'' Peter Bamford, chief executive
of Vodafone's British division, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Arun Sarin, chief executive of Vodafone's U.S., Asia and Pacific
division, said in an interview that ``we would very much like for
this to be a friendly transaction,'' adding, ``There is no need for
this to be hostile.''
</P>
<P>
   If the approach to the supervisory board failed, Gent told
reporters, ``We're prepared, if necessary, to proceed with an
unsolicited bid.''
</P>
<P>
   There has never been a successful hostile takeover in Germany,
and Mannesmann is protected by a company regulation that no
shareholder can control more than 5 percent of voting rights.
</P>
<P>
   Gent said he would canvass his company's shareholders over the
next two days before deciding at a Vodafone board meeting on
Thursday how much to bid.
</P>
<P>
   The offer made Sunday valued Mannesmann at 203 euros a share, or
$209.65 at current rates, and offered 43.7 Vodafone shares for each
Mannesmann share. Analysts now forecast that Vodafone's revised
offer will have to be in the region of 240 euros, or $247.87, a
share to interest Mannesmann stockholders. That would value
Mannesmann in the region of $130 billion, making an offer the
largest hostile bid ever.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in Mannesmann's share price has partly reflected
speculation that other companies might join with Vodafone to make a
bid, possibly Bell Atlantic Corp., a Vodafone partner in the United
States. But Bell Atlantic chief executive Ivan Seidenberg said
Tuesday that his company was not interested.
</P>
<P>
   Gent disclosed his intentions Tuesday as Vodafone announced a
113 percent gain in first-half earnings, to $1.42 billion. The
results exclude the costs of Vodafone's merger in January with
Airtouch of San Francisco.

MYERS HAS FOUND NICHE WITH GALAXY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ When the Los Angeles Galaxy's Roy Myers' name
came up in trade talks earlier this season, the last place the
former New York/New Jersey striker wanted to play was in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to mention his name, but someone on the team in
New York told me, `Don't go to L.A. because there are too many
cliques on the team,' '' Myers said. ``They said it would be
difficult to break in.''
</P>
<P>
   Myers didn't get his wish and struggled early with his new
teammates. But in L.A., he's back playing his familiar midfield
position and producing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a striker,'' Myers said. ``My physical build doesn't
permit me to be a forward; you have to be a little stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in the midfield, I can see everyone in front of me.''
</P>
<P>
   The trade certainly has paid off. The Galaxy is 14-5 since
acquiring Myers, who finished the season with four goals and seven
assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I have a lot of confidence from the players and the
coaches,'' Myers said. ``I'm feeling better and better each week.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's even formed his own clique, albeit one that only
operates on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy midfield playmaker Mauricio Cienfuegos struggled after
fellow playmaker and defensive specialist Martin Machon left to
play in Mexico. Cienfuegos already was a marked man, but without
any help, he also was an easy man to mark.
</P>
<P>
   That changed when Myers arrived in July.
</P>
<P>
   After a slow start in Los Angeles, Myers has adjusted and become
a perfect complement to Cienfuegos.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has definitely given me a helping hand,'' Cienfuegos said.
``I was one of the happier people when he arrived because he helped
me with the attack, and we complement each other well.''
</P>
<P>
   With two playmakers in the middle, United's Richie Williams, who
is responsible for shutting down the opposing team's top player,
could be in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Roy is very skillful one-on-one,'' said Galaxy coach Sigi
Schmid. ``He can beat people on the dribble and make something out
of nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's on defense where the 30-year-old Myers' work is often
overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been saying all along that the one guy who really doesn't
get a lot of mention and is a very, very key player and maybe the
key in this game is Roy Myers,'' said Galaxy assistant coach Ralph
Perez. ``We know what he can do offensively, but it's the little
things he does on the other end that make him complete.''

ARMY GENERAL DEMOTED 2 RANKS IN SEXUAL HARASSMENT CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the first time in history, the Army on Tuesday
demoted a major general two ranks and forced him into retirement as
a colonel for having adulterous affairs with the wives of his
subordinates.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. John Maher, until recently a vice director for the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, was demoted by Louis Caldera, the secretary
of the Army. The demotion will include a reduction of $18,000 in
Maher's annual pension, which could cost him hundreds of thousands
of dollars over a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two-grade reduction from major general to colonel should
send a very clear, strong signal that there is no place in the Army
for this behavior,'' Caldera said.
</P>
<P>
   Maher, 51, was found guilty of conduct unbecoming an officer in
an administrative hearing in September and received the maximum
sentence: loss of one-half his monthly pay for two months and a
letter of reprimand. Besides his affairs with two officers' wives,
Maher also tried to have ``an improper personal relationship'' with
an enlisted soldier.
</P>
<P>
   The far more severe punishment of losing his two stars was
applied by Caldera in a review of the general's retirement. In
explaining the severity of this action, an Army official pointed
out that the admiral and general commanding the forces at Pearl
Harbor received the same punishment for their failures in the face
of the Japanese attack.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time in three months that the Army has
demoted a general for sexually harassing the wives of subordinates.
In September, in an unprecedented action, Maj. Gen. David Hale, who
had already retired, was reduced by one rank for having adulterous
affairs with the wives of four subordinates.
</P>
<P>
   Hale had been allowed to retire even though charges against him
were under investigation. The Army was immediately accused of
employing a double standard. Members of Congress, in particular,
contended that senior officers were allowed to escape punishment
for sexual misconduct that could have led to more rigorous
prosecution of a junior officer or enlisted soldier.
</P>
<P>
   Having learned their lesson from that episode, Army officials
said they denied Maher's request for an early retirement while his
case was under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   While Army officials said that these two demotions of generals
demonstrate that such behavior will not be tolerated at any rank,
critics complained that Maher should have faced a court-martial,
not an administrative hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, this was a heavy price to pay, but much lower-ranking
people would have gone to court-martial for such an offense, and
they could have lost everything,'' said Tod Ensign, director of
Citizen Soldier, a nonprofit advocacy group for soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Maher, who is married, escaped a court-martial and possible
prison sentence for several reasons, an army official said. The
women in the case wanted to avoid a trial, the official said, and
there was a question of the statute of limitations. Moreover,
officials said, the general did not contest the investigation or
the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Maher's adulterous affairs began in 1991 and did not end until
1998, said Army officials who declined to provide any more details.
During that time he rose from colonel to major general, in
positions including assistant chief of staff for operations and
plans at Fort Lewis, Wash., and commanding general of the 25th
Infantry Division (Light) at Schofield Barracks in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   He was vice director of operations on the staff of the Joint
Chiefs when he learned in February that he was under investigation
for sexual harassment. He was then sent to Fort Gillem, in Forest
Park, Ga., where the commander, Lt. Gen. John Riggs, oversaw his
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Through his lawyer, Maher said he would not comment on the case.
Maher will retire within the month, Army officials said.

IT'S UNANIMOUS: MARTINEZ WINS AL CY YOUNG AWARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez became only the third pitcher to win Cy Young
awards in both leagues when he was given the American League honor
unanimously Tuesday. Martinez figured that would happen, after he
went 23-4 with a 2.07 earned run average for the Boston Red Sox and
established himself as the game's most dominant pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   The real mystery is whether he will win the most valuable player
award, something that pitchers have done only 18 times before. The
results of that voting will be announced Thursday; Martinez is
considered a front-runner, along with Cleveland's Roberto Alomar
and Manny Ramirez, Ivan Rodriguez of the Texas Rangers, Boston's
Nomar Garciaparra and the Yankees' Derek Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Eckersley was the last pitcher to win both the Cy Young
and the MVP in the same season, in 1992; only nine pitchers have
done so since 1956, the first season of the Cy Young award.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who seemed headed for a 30-victory season before he
was sidelined by shoulder soreness in July, received all 28
first-place votes for the Cy Young award this year, for 140 points.
Mike Mussina of the Baltimore Orioles finished second with 53
points, and Mariano Rivera, the Yankees' closer who did not allow a
run for the final two and a half months of the regular season, had
27 points for third place. Two writers in each of the 14 American
League cities vote on the award, picking first, second and third
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pretty much expected it, but it's always nice to receive an
award like this,'' said Martinez, who won the National League Cy
Young award in 1997 with the Montreal Expos. Randy Johnson _ who
was named the NL Cy Young award winner for 1999 on Monday _ and the
Hall of Famer Gaylord Perry are the only other pitchers to win the
award in both leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's earned run average was nearly one and a half runs
lower than Mussina's 3.44, which was second in that category, and
nearly three runs lower than the league ERA of 4.86. He averaged
13.2 strikeouts per nine innings; Anaheim's Chuck Finley was
second, with 8.44. When Martinez struck out 17 batters in a game
against the Yankees in September, allowing one hit and no walks _
the most strikeouts ever in a game pitched against the Yankees _
David Cone and others remarked that it was the best pitching
performance they had ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope I'm able to do it again, and improve on it,'' said
Martinez, who turned 28 in October. ``I don't see why not. I'm
still young.''
</P>
<P>
   After Martinez was introduced as the Cy Young award winner
Tuesday, in a conference call with reporters, many of the questions
he answered were about Thursday's MVP announcement. Martinez
himself said the MVP award ``would mean a lot, probably more than
the Cy Young award.''
</P>
<P>
   Many players _ particularly position players _ believe that
pitchers should not be considered for the MVP award, because the
best pitcher can be honored with a Cy Young award, and because
pitchers do not play every day.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez disagrees with the premise that pitchers cannot be the
most valuable player. ``I don't see why not,'' he said.
``Otherwise, we should be erased from the roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I win it, fine. If I don't, fine. There's no crying in
baseball. But they shouldn't discriminate against anyone for their
position.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox went 24-5 (.828) in games started by Martinez; their
record in the games he did not start was 70-63 (.526). Only three
NL pitchers have won both the Cy Young and MVP awards _ Don
Newcombe in 1956, Sandy Koufax in 1966 and Bob Gibson in 1968 _
while Denny McLain (1968), Vida Blue (1971), Rollie Fingers (1981),
Willie Hernandez (1984), Roger Clemens (1986) and Eckersley have
done so in the AL.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said that if he were voting, he would pick Garciaparra
for MVP. The Boston shortstop was the anchor of the Red Sox lineup,
winning the batting title with a .357 average, driving in 104 runs
and collecting 190 hits even though he played in just 135 games.
</P>
<P>
   Alomar appeared to play with joy for the first time since his
spitting incident with Umpire John Hirschbeck in 1996. He batted
.323, with a league-high 138 runs, as well as 120 RBI., and played
defense worthy of another Gold Glove award.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez, the Indians' cleanup hitter, drove in 165 runs, best in
the league, and hit .333. Rodriguez won another Gold Glove for his
defense and hit .332. The Yankees had the best record in the league
and Jeter was the team's best everyday player, topping the league
with 219 hits and finishing second to Garciaparra with a .349
batting average.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez strained his back pitching in the playoffs, dominating
the Yankees in Boston's only victory in the AL Championship Series
in spite of his ailment. He said he has been getting regular
treatment for his injury in the off-season, indicating that he will
be ready for the start of next season.

THREE BIG AIRLINES JOIN OTHERS ON PRICELINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mcd) 
 By JANE L. LEVERE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Priceline.com, the online company that lets consumers bid for
everything from airline tickets to cars and groceries, has signed
up three of the nation's top six airlines, in effect doubling the
number of airline seats it can sell.
</P>
<P>
   By signing up the carriers _ No. 1 United Airlines, No. 2
American Airlines and No. 6 US Airways _ Priceline is now working
with eight of the nine largest U.S. carriers. Other U.S. carriers
working with Priceline are America West, Delta, Continental,
Northwest and TWA; 20 foreign lines also participate.
</P>
<P>
   Airline tickets were the first merchandise Priceline sold when
it began operations in April 1998. Prospective buyers submit an
offer for a ticket online; if their price is accepted, they must
purchase the ticket. Buyers also must be flexible about their
departure time, and be willing to make a connection en route. Those
conditions have made Priceline's service far more practical for
leisure travelers than for those flying on business.
</P>
<P>
   Although Priceline has insisted from the start that its ticket
program would help airlines get rid of unsold seats, most major
airlines resisted cooperating with the company, supposedly because
they were unwilling to turn over control of their inventory to a
third party. Initially, only TWA and America West, among the
smallest of the nation's major airlines, worked with Priceline.
Then last summer, Delta joined up, and was followed by Northwest
and Continental.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Braddock, chairman and chief executive of Priceline,
said the decision by American, United and US Airways to join forces
with the online company represented an endorsement of Priceline's
success. According to Braddock, Priceline's weekly sales of airline
tickets have increased tenfold since January; the company sold
5,000 tickets a week at the beginning of the year and now sells
more than 50,000 a week.
</P>
<P>
   Braddock, who said Priceline's airline program generated 80
percent of the company's total revenues, also predicted the
addition of the new airlines would create ``dramatically better
results'' for the airline program. And he said the expanded airline
program would lure more customers and create more opportunities to
sell them Priceline's other services.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Harris, airline analyst for Salomon Smith Barney, said the
decision by American, United and US Airways to participate proved
that the company was ``an important distribution channel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past airlines felt they could ignore it,'' he said,
``but that hurt them, and now they want in on it.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of its agreements with the three airlines, Priceline has
restructured warrant agreements with all its U. S. airline
participants to give them equity positions close to the size of
their share of the domestic market.

<P>
   CHESTER, N.J. _ Thirty-one hunters in camouflage pants and
orange vests gathered just after dawn on a recent Saturday morning
at a state preserve here, sipping from steaming cups, munching
doughnuts and talking about barrel gauges and bird dogs.
</P>
<P>
   It was a quintessential fall scene, except that the cups
contained cocoa, not coffee, and these hunters were boys and girls,
many just 10 years old and some shorter than their shotguns.
</P>
<P>
   They were waiting to follow grown-up guides into the Black River
Wildlife Management Area to shoot pheasant _ five dozen farm-raised
birds that volunteers had deposited in fields there an hour
earlier. On a patchwork of other state preserves across New Jersey,
nearly 500 other children were doing the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   It was Take a Kid Pheasant Hunting Day, an event run since 1996
by the New Jersey Division of Fish, Game and Wildlife, and partly
paid for by the National Rifle Association Foundation, an arm of
the gun lobby. (The state supplied the wardens and the land; the
gun foundation paid for the birds and the shotgun shells.
Volunteers from New Jersey hunting clubs supplied the dogs and the
doughnuts.)
</P>
<P>
   Shooting programs for children are nothing new; the NRA and
private gun clubs have had them for generations. In recent years,
state wildlife agencies around the country have run special youth
hunts for an assortment of game, including wild pigs, rabbits,
ducks and deer. But the New Jersey pheasant shoot was an example of
a newer and growing phenomenon _ of public state wildlife agencies
and the gun lobby working hand in hand to promote hunting among
children.
</P>
<P>
   The public agencies and private group say they are motivated by
the same goal: to shore up hunting's popularity, which has been
slowly declining in the 1990s, according to recent federal and
state hunter surveys. The trend has left gun groups anxious to find
new members and state wildlife agencies _ whose budgets are almost
entirely dependent on license fees and income from an 11 percent
federal tax on guns and ammunition distributed to the states _
scrambling for revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shooting sports are like any other endeavor _ youth is our
future,'' said William Poole, director of education and training
for the NRA. ``The state agencies understand that same
philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   Promoting hunting among young people, he added, ``is mutually
beneficial to all of us, and to meeting all of our missions.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun makers are chipping in, donating hundreds of ``youth-size''
shotguns over the last few years to state agencies for children's
shooting clinics and hunter training.
</P>
<P>
   But animal rights and gun control groups have sharply criticized
the state-run youth hunting programs, saying they are designed to
create new interest in guns just as the country is grappling with a
spate of shootings by children and young adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we head into a new century,''said Stuart Chaifetz, the
founder of Honor and Non-Violence for Animals, a New Jersey animal
rights group, ``do we really want to have the state teaching kids
that shooting is fun?''
</P>
<P>
   National gun control groups like the Violence Policy Center have
criticized the flow of public money to private hunting initiatives
for children. For example, in 1993, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service was widely criticized for giving a $230,000 grant to the
National Shooting Sports Foundation, a private group representing
gun makers, to create and distribute to schools a videotape
promoting the role of hunting in wildlife management.
</P>
<P>
   But there has been little public debate about the flow of money
in the other direction _ from the private NRA Foundation to public
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that the flow is still a trickle. Most youth
shooting programs sponsored by the NRA are run by private groups,
like the Boy Scouts, Jaycees or shooting clubs. Since 1993, the NRA
Foundation has awarded more than 3,000 grants totaling $21 million
to such groups. But since 1996, NRA grants ranging from $1,000 to
$10,000 have gone to state-run youth hunting programs in Oregon,
Texas, New Jersey and a few other states, NRA officials say, and
this kind of partnership is growing.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey game officials say they are happy to accept the
money. ``The NRA promotes safe and responsible gun handling,'' said
Patrick Carr, the state's hunter education administrator, ``and
members raise money so the foundation can support programs like
ours. We're showing these youths the proper way to use a firearm in
a legal activity _ hunting. If you don't show them the right way,
that's the wrong move.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission recently used a $10,000
NRA grant to help buy and develop software for a big-screen hunting
simulator that is trucked to schools and county fairs, where
children and adults can fire virtual guns at virtual game.
</P>
<P>
   The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife has received money
from the NRA and Pheasants Forever, a private pheasant-hunting and
conservation group, for its annual pheasant hunts for children.
</P>
<P>
   The pheasant group has bought farm-raised birds for the
children's hunts, while the NRA grants have been used to buy
ammunition for shotgun clinics that are offered on the same day,
said Tony Burtt, the outdoor skills coordinator for the Oregon
wildlife agency.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut and Texas are among
more than three dozen states that have received donated batches of
50 small shotguns for use in clinics and hunter education programs
from H &AMP; R 1871, a gun maker in Gardner, Mass., which specializes
in small firearms for children and women.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Sharpless, a senior vice president at the eight-year-old
company, said the donation program was focused on improving gun
safety, not on promoting gun use.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not courting kids into the shooting sports,'' he said.
``These are kids whose families are already hunting. The goal is to
facilitate safety. You wouldn't put a 6-year-old child on a 26-inch
mountain bike.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In late October, Connecticut held its annual youth pheasant hunt
on state property in East Windsor, north of Hartford. The
Connecticut program is much smaller than New Jersey's and is not
underwritten by the NRA. Even so, it generated its share of
protesters.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the 20 or so people who picketed at the entrance to the
Dr. John E. Flaherty Field Trial area outnumbered the seven hunters
between the ages of 12 and 16 who spent several hours stalking
pheasants with volunteer adult guides. As the children arrived, the
protesters chanted, ``Shame, shame.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All this does is provide living targets for these kids and
increase their comfort level with firearms,'' said William Manetti,
52, of New Haven, Conn., a founder of the Animal Rights Front, a
small New Haven group.
</P>
<P>
   David Leff, Connecticut's deputy commissioner of environmental
protection, defended the program. He said the program provided a
substitute for the kind of guidance that used to come from older
relatives but is fading.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The annual youth pheasant hunt in New Jersey, held Nov. 6, one
week before the regular pheasant-hunting season, which began Nov.
13, has been more popular every year, said Carr, the state hunter
education administrator, growing from 143 participants in 1996 to
around 500 this year.
</P>
<P>
   On this Saturday morning at the 3,000-acre preserve in Chester,
Carr and several other state officials and volunteers checked in a
steady flow of children.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone had learned of the hunts in the annual state
booklet announcing hunting regulations and season dates. Many of
the children, including several girls, said they had grown up
planning to follow their fathers into the field. Michael Meola,
from Denville, said he enjoyed taking his son, also named Michael,
on the children's hunts because they were safe and uncrowded.
``It's controlled,'' Meola said. ``Not like when you take them out
on opening day with a million guys out there.''
</P>
<P>
   All of them had junior hunting licenses pinned to the back of
their orange vests and had taken the mandatory 10-hour state
hunting education course. Several boys restlessly hefted their
shotgun cases while others were told by their fathers to not touch
their guns until cleared to pick them up.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles away, out in the fields, volunteers were opening
crates, pulling out the pheasants, then _ holding the birds by the
legs _ spinning them to make them dizzy, so they would stay put in
the grass until flushed out.
</P>
<P>
   In the parking lot, the pointers and setters owned by volunteer
dog handlers eagerly paced to and fro.
</P>
<P>
   Standing atop a picnic table, Carr gave a briefing on safety
rules. ``Keep your muzzle up,'' he said. ``Don't shoot a bird on
the ground; don't shoot cripples. The dogs will get them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have a fun day, but be safe and responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the children lined up to receive six shells apiece.
</P>
<P>
   As the last morning mist evaporated, the group headed off to the
far corner of the state tract, which winds along the Black River.
Groups of four children followed the dog handlers to separate
fields, each of which had been stocked with two pheasants for each
young hunter.
</P>
<P>
   Carr explained that the stocking helped ensure that at least a
few children would kill a bird. ``We can't pull the trigger for
them, but we can certainly put the bird out in front of them,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Konboz, 11, of Hawthorne lugged her father's full-size
12-gauge shotgun as she and her father, Anthony, and two boys
followed Scott Wardrop, of Wayne, his dog, Limestone Annie, and his
daughter Kristen, 13.
</P>
<P>
   The dog, scurrying through the weedy field, flushed out the
first bird after about 20 minutes, but it alighted in a tree before
Mary, who was given the first shot, could pull the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't we shoot it in the tree?'' asked Ray Jensen, 11, of
Brodheadsville, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Ray Sr., hesitated, then said: ``We can't. It's not
right.''
</P>
<P>
   The group hiked on, with Annie weaving ahead, nose to the
ground. Sporadic gunfire came from adjacent fields. Another
pheasant burst from the bushes. But Mary hesitated _ appropriately
_ as the bird curled around behind her over the heads of the
hunting party, eliciting a wave of quick dives for cover.
</P>
<P>
   As the morning progressed with no kills by Wardrop's group of
hunters, Konboz said their low success rate proved that this was a
sport, not a slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   During a break, the children rested on the grass, their guns
around them, drinking from cartons of fruit punch and talking about
Harry Potter.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, nobody in Wardrop's group had killed a bird, and
only one had pulled a trigger.
</P>
<P>
   When all the groups returned to check out with officials after
the two-hour hunt, the hunters learned that other groups had had
better luck. Carr noted that 11 of the 64 stocked birds had been
shot, with one more killed by a diving red-tailed hawk.
</P>
<P>
   The successful young hunters pulled their pheasants from pouches
to pose for pictures. One bird exploded to life and burst into the
bushes. It was retrieved by a dog and killed by one of the dog
handlers.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Dara, chairman of the New Jersey Federation of Sportsmen's
Clubs, a private group that provided most of the volunteers, said
anti-hunting sentiment just stiffened the resolve of hunters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just look at 30 years ago versus today,'' he said. ``Then, you
still had kids out in the field with their fathers and you had very
little violence in society, even though there were more guns per
person. Just look at things now.''
</P>
<P>
   He said animal rights demonstrators even showed up at a recent
fishing tournament sponsored by the sportsmen's federation. ``Can
you believe it _ fish rights?'' Dara said. ``But that's all right.
They just help unite us.''
</P>
<P>
   Around 11 a.m., the first round of young hunters and their
fathers headed home, some to cook their birds, others to talk about
the ones that got away.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House and the Republican Congress
struggled on Tuesday night to finish the long overdue budget by
finding a way to pay for nearly $7 billion in new spending.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations broke on Tuesday night without agreement. The
two sides will try to strike a deal on Wednesday. Once that is
done, Republicans will pull the remaining five budget bills into
one $390 billion package and then bring them to a vote, first
before the House then before the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very, very close,'' said the House majority whip, Tom
DeLay of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans are still demanding that the White House agree
to an across-the-board cut of .42 percent in all the spending
bills, and so far, the White House has not budged. President
Clinton vetoed a .97 percent across-the-board cut passed by
Congress two weeks ago, calling it a ``blind'' and ``mindless'' way
to make a budget.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on its size, that across-the-board cut could recoup
some or most of the $7 billion the Republicans have added in recent
weeks, some of it on their own, some at the president's behest.
</P>
<P>
   The rest could be made up with accounting maneuvers, like
delaying the last paycheck for Pentagon personnel in September 2000
until after Oct.1, the beginning of the next fiscal year, which
would shift more than $2 billion from this year's budget into the
next.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Republican negotiators, like the chairmen of the
Senate and House Appropriations Committees, Sen. Ted Stevens of
Alaska and Rep. C.W. Bill Young of Florida, say they hate the idea
of an across-the-board cut, because it trims spending
indiscriminately.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, they have to support it. Their leaders have
demanded it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be some across-the-board cut,'' promised the House
majority leader, Rep. Dick Armey of Texas. Stevens said on Tuesday
night that the idea was ``on the table,'' but ``on the edge of the
table,'' where it has been pushed by Democrats' opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans say that either the White House must make the
across-the-board cut or come up with nearly $7 billion in savings
by some combination of cuts and accounting mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
   The $7 billion in savings is necessary for the Republicans to be
able to say that the final budget will not dip into Social Security
surpluses. That vow has been their rallying cry in Congress this
year.
</P>
<P>
   But to keep that promise, they have used a budgetary device
making close to $20 billion in spending disappear from the federal
ledger _ a device calculated by the Republicans to make their
numbers come out the way they want.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office puts the total cost of the
year's 13 spending bills at roughly $610 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That is $30 billion more than the spending limits, or caps, that
Congress swore to uphold in this year's budget when they passed the
Balanced Budget Act of 1997. It is at least $15 billion more than
the surplus of general government funds, which would mean that the
rest would have to come from the Social Security reserves.
</P>
<P>
   And that does not include $15 billion in spending in this year's
budget that Congress has decided to tap out of the budget for
fiscal 2001, which begins next Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In the final analysis, said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the
Republican-controlled Congress ``spent money from the Social
Security trust fund, and we busted the caps that were agreed to in
1997. It's all very, very regrettable.'' he said in an interview
Monday night with CNN. ``And we may pay a heavy price in not being
able to make Social Security whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the other Republicans in Congress fervently deny
this. ``Republicans have balanced _ will have balanced the budget
without raiding Social Security,'' DeLay said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The different tenses he used show that Republicans may have to
rely on higher-than-expected tax revenues in the coming months to
ensure that their fiscal 2000 budget will not use the retirement
reserves.
</P>
<P>
   If that does not happen, they may have to find a way to cut the
budget in midyear, said DeLay, who has been the chief Republican
spending strategist in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is,'' DeLay explained, ``we will have a mid-course
correction come January or February, and if it looks like we're
going to spend the Social Security surplus, we'll cut spending to
make sure we don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the spending bills tap into surplus Social
Security revenues has absolutely no effect on the long-term fiscal
health of the retirement funds, according to almost every
independent budget analyst and fiscal expert.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the political contest over which party is the truer
guardian of the Social Security system has become one of the big
symbolic struggles in this session of Congress.

 By BILL SULLIVAN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Coming in second in the Pan Am Games was a warning sign. A
last-place finish at the gymnastics world championships confirmed
suspicions that something was amiss.
<TEXT>
<P>
   What to do, then, with the 2000 Summer Olympics coming up fast?
</P>
<P>
   ``What we needed was to draw on the most experienced, most
successful coach in the world,'' Bob Colarossi, president of USA
Gymnastics, said Tuesday. ``We're lucky we had that available to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: Bela Karolyi is back, and the next 10 months figure
to be lively as the road to Sydney comes through Houston after all.
</P>
<P>
   Karolyi, 57, returns in a different capacity, not as coach but
as national team coordinator. That new role was announced Tuesday
by USA Gymnastics, which has turned to the Romanian-born,
Houston-based legend to resurrect a program that has fallen on hard
times since winning team gold at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Karolyi will design the overall training program and oversee
preparations for the U.S. effort in Australia. He also will serve
as adviser to the individual coaches, direct the team's final
preparations and have a key role in determining the composition of
the team.
</P>
<P>
   So much for that retirement he announced after Atlanta. Now,
with less than a year to get ready, Karolyi will attempt to whip a
young, inexperienced team into shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm expecting 2000 to be the greatest year of my coaching
career,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Karolyi has been a member of the U.S. coaching staff at the last
four Olympics. Since Atlanta _ where he directed a group that
included Dominique Moceanu and Kerri Strug to the team title _ he
has managed grass-roots gymnastics camps and clinics at his
500-acre ranch near Houston.
</P>
<P>
   In his absence, the individual coach system the United States
employed so successfully in '96 has produced fractious philosophies
and subpar results. After finishing last among six teams at worlds,
USA Gymnastics acknowledged a different approach was needed.
</P>
<P>
   Karolyi might not have the title of coach, but it is clear who
is in charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``From now on, the athletes will be directed toward the same
goal,'' Karolyi said. ``We'll coordinate their effort, not
chaotically go that way or that way. We want to guide based on a
common understanding: Our focus is not exclusively national or
Olympic trials, but the Olympic Games.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Karolyi will conduct periodic camps in the months
leading to the Olympics. He'll hold an introductory session in
Tulsa, Okla., next month for the 14 to 16 top prospects and their
coaches, with subsequent gatherings at his ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Given his bombastic nature, Karolyi's presence makes him the
dominant personality in just about any undertaking.
</P>
<P>
   But Colarossi and Karolyi insisted Sydney is not bound to become
Karolyi's show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the concerns of the individual coaches would be
exactly that question,'' Karolyi said. ``They deserve credit for
their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not even a question that I'm going to step on the floor
and take anything away from them. What I'm ready to do at this time
_ what I consider very important _ is to coordinate the coaches'
efforts, to bring them together, to make them understand certain
situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I'm called `coordinator,' not `national team
coach.'''
</P>
<P>
   Karolyi said he had been approached a year ago about assuming
some role with the struggling national team but had rejected the
idea because, ``At that time, I didn't feel there was so much
need.'' The continued demise of the program changed his mind, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Karolyi rose to international prominence as coach of 1976
Olympic gold-medal winner Nadia Comaneci, who scored the sport's
first perfect 10. Over the years, he has produced 28 Olympians,
nine Olympic champions, 15 world champions and six U.S. national
champions.
</P>
<P>
   His golden touch will be put to the test again as he tries to
restore the U.S. program to the heights of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``In '96, we had a very experienced, seasoned group of
athletes,'' Colarossi said. ``This group of athletes has a lot
lower level of experience, although they have great talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This system Bela is going to put into place is going to do two
things: It's going to shore up whatever deficiencies they have, and
it's going to allow them to draw from the confidence and experience
that Bela just possesses naturally.''
</P>
<P>
   Karolyi said he will not take on any full-time students in
preparation for Sydney, citing ``an immense conflict of interest. I
would not be able to do that, and I would not be willing to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic Trials are in August in Boston. After a few days
off, the team will come to Houston for a final training camp before
leaving for Australia. In the interim, Karolyi clearly has his work
cut out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The easy thing was to sit back and wait for better results in
Sydney,'' Colarossi said. ``But our feeling was that we owed it to
everyone who invests in our sport to try and step in and make a
change and make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter Karolyi, as the summer of 2000 suddenly gets a good deal
more interesting.

CONDEMNED MAN RESISTS GUARDS BEFORE EXECUTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN MORITZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas _ Desmond Jennings, condemned for a double
killing at a drug haven in Fort Worth, Texas, just after Christmas
1993, was executed Tuesday night after defiantly struggling with a
five-man team of guards who subdued him in his holding cell and
carried him to the death chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings, 27, remained unruly right up until he was strapped to
the gurney where the lethal injection was administered. He declined
to make a final statement, and was pronounced dead at 6:22 p.m.,
seven minutes after drugs were administered.
</P>
<P>
   The resistance, which began just after noon when officials
attempted to remove Jennings from his cell at the Ellis Unit to
take him to a holding cell outside the death chamber, was the first
time since at least 1982 that a condemned inmate in Texas refused
to comply with orders requiring him to prepare for execution,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Prison system spokesman Larry Todd said Jennings had warned the
Walls Unit warden that he had no intention of going quietly to his
death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not do this,'' Jennings was quoted as saying before the
five-man extraction team subdued him. The team was outfitted with
helmets, face guards, chest protectors and shin guards, officials
said. Jennings threw no punches, and no one was hurt in the
struggle, Todd said.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings, who once worked as a nurse's aide and had a
ninth-grade education, was convicted of fatally shooting Sylvester
Walton, 44, and Wonda Matthews, 27. According to court documents,
Jennings and an accomplice entered a house in southeast Fort Worth
seeking drugs on Dec. 27, 1993. Shortly after entering the house,
Jennings opened fire with a handgun.
</P>
<P>
   Walton was killed by a bullet that hit him in the nose and
traveled through his brain. Matthews was shot twice in the face and
once in the back of the head. Jennings took a pouch containing a
small amount of drugs and money from Walton's pocket before he and
his companion left the house, records show.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1995 trial, prosecutors called Jennings a drug abuser
who lusted for ``the taste of blood.'' Authorities said he also
killed at least three others in 1993 in what were described as
drug-related attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings spent his last day reading and lying on a prison bunk.
After first refusing to take a call from his son, Jennings spoke by
telephone with the youngster. He declined to eat breakfast and did
not order a final meal.
</P>
<P>
   Although the condemned man had no history of discipline problems
during his four-year prison stay, he did not leave Death Row
quietly.
</P>
<P>
   When officials came to take him from his cell at the Ellis Unit
at 12:30 p.m., he refused to budge, officials said. An extraction
team was assembled and Jennings was subdued with a pepper spray.
</P>
<P>
   He was placed in a prison van for the half-hour trip to the
Walls Unit in downtown Huntsville, and he walked from the vehicle
to a holding cell outside the death chamber without incident. He
was shackled at the ankles and wrists, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings was not in restraints after he was placed in his
holding cell. But when the team arrived shortly before 6 p.m. to
escort him to his execution, Jennings was quoted as saying he was
``ready for round two.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, the team subdued Jennings without using the chemical
spray, Todd said. The corrections officers had to carry the
5-foot-6, 185-pound Jennings to the chamber and place him on the
gurney.
</P>
<P>
   As he was carried to the chamber, he told guards, ``Thank you
for not using gas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time since 1982 (when the state resumed
capital punishment) that an incident like this occurred,'' said
Larry Fitzgerald, another prison system spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Hamza, Wonda Matthews' sister, viewed the execution and
said ``justice had been served.'' She said she felt pain for
Jennings' family.
</P>
<P>
   ``God says you have to forgive, but I don't have to forget,''
said Hamza, who declined to talk about her sister other than to say
she left three children, who are now 15, 14 and 12 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The execution, the 29th in Texas this year and the 193rd since
the state resumed capital punishment, was witnessed by 15 prison
officials, three relatives of victims, a chaplain and five news
media representatives, including one from the Fort Worth
Star-Telegram.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings was also accused of gunning down Dino Beasley, 29, and
Charlotte Dickerson, 31, who was found fatally shot on Christmas
Eve 1993 inside a drug house; and Larry Eugene Wilson, 43, who was
killed by a shotgun blast Oct. 23, 1993, at a marijuana house.
</P>
<P>
   The execution was the first of three scheduled for this week. On
Wednesday, John Lamb of Hunt County is scheduled to die, and on
Thursday, Jose Gutierrez of Brazos County is scheduled to be
executed.

A DREAMSCAPE OF MILLENNIAL FEARS AND HOPES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 21) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The public impact of the millennium has so far been pretty tame:
anxiety over New Year's party plans and mild speculation about
whether global computers will, indeed, hit a bump when midnight
strikes is about as far as it goes.
</P>
<P>
   But for most Americans not so long ago (and for many Americans
still), the idea of the turn of the millennium carried profound
weight. It wasn't just a date to scratch off the calendar. In
Judeo-Christian religious terms, it signified the end of time, the
culmination of history, when good and evil faced off once and for
all, and God's kingdom arrived on earth.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of final days comes from biblical texts, the Book of
Daniel in the Old Testament and the Book of Revelation in the New
Testament. But millennialism isn't confined to dogmatic beliefs or
an event. It is also a mood, a state of expectation, a sense that
one has a leading role to play in the cosmic drama. And America has
always envisioned itself as the millennial nation, with a destiny
to fulfill.
</P>
<P>
   The New England Puritans called themselves ``a city on a hill,''
a moral beacon for a depraved Europe. The young American republic
of the 19th century was described as the New Eden, uncorrupted,
fecund, redeemed. In the 20th century, the country's wealth and
technological power seemed to confirm that the Space Age future lay
here.
</P>
<P>
   Millennial thinking resonates through American politics, from
Manifest Destiny to the ``vision thing'' any presidential hopeful
is still required to spin out. It has always been there in high
art: in the nationalist allegories of Hudson River School landscape
painting, in Social Realism, with its demand for a new order, in
Abstract Expressionism, with its commitment to the sublime.
</P>
<P>
   And nowhere is millennialism more consistently explored than in
vernacular culture. This fact makes ``Millennial Dreams: Vision and
Prophecy in American Folk Art,'' organized by Gerald C. Wertkin at
the Museum of American Folk Art through May 14, one of the few
genuinely timely museum offerings of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Like the millennium, the show is very much about popular
religious ideas of time, and the earliest images are of the
mercurial Father Time himself, seen in photographs of New England
gravestones. On one, carved in 1681 for the Boston astronomer John
Foster, he is a protective presence, preventing death from making
full claim on the deceased. But on another, dated 1743, he turns
predatory, wielding the scythe that cuts life down.
</P>
<P>
   Just as visions of time expressed both fear and hope, concepts
of the millennium have invited two very different approaches. One,
described as premillennialist, envisions a sin-riddled world
hurtling toward destruction from which a few repentant souls might
be saved. The other, a &UR;  &LR; postmillennialist view, proposes a more
agreeable picture of paradise attained on earth, a Godly universe
gradually transformed and perfected through the strenuous efforts
of human beings.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the mid-19th century, premillennialism has found avid
champions. Prominent among them was William Miller (1782-1849), a
farmer-turned-prophet in upstate New York, who calculated that the
world would self-destruct in 1843 or 1844, and who printed up
instructional charts to get his followers over the end-of-time
hump.
</P>
<P>
   His alarmist sensibility lives on in art today. One finds it in
the manic, visionary work of the prolific Rev. Howard Finster of
Alabama. And it is there in the vivid paintings of the Pentecostal
preacher William A. Blayney (1917-1985), each of them a
diagrammatic breakdown of the Book of Daniel, filled with
apocalyptic monsters and real-life despots.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is postmillennialism, whose upbeat, messianic message
has been an important force in progressive America culture. In the
view of the late historian Alan Heimert, postmillennial optimism
helped ignite and fuel the American Revolution. It was a prime
ingredient in the religious awakenings that swept the country from
the 18th to the 20th centuries. And it has consistently been the
impetus behind the nation's great reform movements, from abolition
to temperance to civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   Both attitudes are evident in the Museum of American Folk Art
show, which is, like the biblical millennium, introduced by angels.
Gabriel sounds his horn on a Connecticut weather vane. The
archangel Michael strikes a militant pose in a devotional painting
from New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   A limestone angel with wide-awake eyes by William Edmondson
(circa 1870-1951) is backed up by an 1848 quilt stitched with
angelic words by Maria Cadman Hubbard: ``Little acts of kindness,
little words of love make our earthly Eden like our heaven above.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For American utopians, of which there have always been many,
human and divine realms were contiguous; the promised land was here
and now. This was true of Shakers, who believed that their leader,
the English-born prophet Mother Ann Lee (1736-1784), had ushered in
the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Shaker life _ communal, celibate and industrious _ was conceived
as a version of heaven on earth. Every material aspect of it, from
buildings to bonnets to furniture, was shaped to sustain the ideal
of utilitarian perfection. And certain items were thought to have
been directly conveyed, in essence and sometimes in fact, by
spirits.
</P>
<P>
   These included so-called gift drawings. Some were pictures of
symbolic trees and fruits; others were heart-shaped valentines
dense with written texts. Most were produced by women like Hannah
Cohoon and Polly Ann Reed, who experienced visions during the
dynamic, revivalist period in Shaker history known as ``Mother's
Work.''
</P>
<P>
   From the start, women have played a crucial role in pre- and
postmillennialist art. Such is the case with quilters like Maria
Hubbard and Harriet Powers (1837-1911), an ex-slave from Georgia,
whose stitched scenes of the Apocalypse incorporated textile
traditions from West Africa. And then there were painters, none
more engaging than Sister Gertrude Morgan (1900-1980), a street
preacher, singer, and founder of the Everlasting Gospel Mission in
New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, who began and ended her artistic career at the command
of a divine voice, painted narrative scenes from the Book of
Revelation on window shades, funeral parlor fans and pieces of
shirt cardboard. She also created exultant depictions of a paradise
populated with interracial angels, an apt symbol of the perpetual
harmony that defines the millennial era.
</P>
<P>
   No image of that harmony is more familiar than ``The Peaceable
Kingdom'' of the Pennsylvania artist Edward Hicks. If Morgan set
her sights on heaven, Hicks kept his trained on earth, but an earth
made new, where lions and lambs lay down together and where the
Quaker leader William Penn sealed a pact of friendship with
American Indians.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, a substantial selection of Hicks' work is on
display at the Philadelphia Museum of Art (through Jan. 2), in one
of several millennialist shows that don't bill themselves as such.
Others include ``The Shaker Legacy'' at the New York State Museum
in Albany (through Jan. 2.) and an exhibition devoted to the Virgin
of Guadalupe, a millenarian political icon for Mexican-Americans,
at El Museo del Barrio in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Is millennium-inspired thinking still active in modern America?
One can certainly locate it in the 1960s counterculture, with its
evangelical hunger for social transformation and cosmic
consciousness. It is there in New Age culture, which brings the
extraordinary into the everyday and has roots going back into the
19th century, when Spiritualism and the nascent women's rights
movement were closely linked.
</P>
<P>
   One might even look for it in contemporary art. A version of
premillennialist pessimism is detectable in the scathing moral
indictments of a polemical artist like Sue Coe. And postmillennial
perfectionism lives on in the paintings of Agnes Martin and the
luminous, perception-altering environments of Robert Irwin, such as
the one on view at DIA Center in Manhattan (through December).
</P>
<P>
   Their work, and the ardent, insistent visions of the artists at
the Museum of American Folk Art, are reminders of the many ways the
millennium might be considered. Not just in terms of Y2K
get-togethers and glitches, but in terms of what has been and might
be. Millennialism is, for better and worse, an American legacy, and
part of the wound-down but still ticking mechanism known as the
American Dream.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a recent warm afternoon, a crowd of lively boys
and girls make their way along West 89th Street in Manhattan to the
homey headquarters of Ballet Hispanico. With their book bags heavy
with dance gear, they jokingly try out ballet moves to the loud
salsa pouring from an open window.
</P>
<P>
   In a neighborhood that Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans and
many other Hispanic nationalities call home, it seems only natural
that there would be a dance school here dedicated to their
cultures.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1970, when Tina Ramirez established the Ballet Hispanico
school and company, it was a revolutionary act. Hispanics not only
had few dance schools, they also had trouble getting into dance
companies, an almost unimaginable situation now with the dazzling
Hispanic dancers in mainstream ballet and modern companies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This fall Ms. Ramirez and her groundbreaking enterprise won two
major honors. In September, she received the Hispanic Heritage
Award for Education at the Kennedy Center in Washington. Since its
founding, almost 10,000 children have studied at the Ballet
Hispanico School, which now enrolls 600 students yearly for classes
in Spanish, modern and jazz dance and ballet.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't even include the thousands who have studied in its
outreach programs around the country. In addition, the Ford
Foundation gave Ballet Hispanico a $1 million grant, an impressive
amount in these days of cutbacks to cultural institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always knew that finally we would be widely recognized,''
she says, walking though the building's lobby as students stream
through on their way to class. ``Our music and dance are so
powerful, so earthy, so rhythmic; in the end, few can resist.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ms. Ramirez has invited a few guests to see the three new
works receiving their New York premieres at the Joyce Theater
during the company's two-week season, beginning on Nov. 30. In a
spacious second-floor studio, a distance from the happy clamor
below, her 12 dancers warm up, preparing for the very different
choreographic styles of the American David Rousseve, the Cuban
Pedro Ruiz and the Brazilian Regina Miranda.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 22 nations that speak Spanish,'' says Ms. Ramirez.
``They have many similarities and many differences, although all
share Arab, Jewish, African and American-Indian influences. I
represent as many as I can, but I also commission non-Hispanics who
understand our culture.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the repertory includes works by choreographers as
diverse as the postmodernist Susan Marshall and Talley Beatty and
George Faison, both of them influenced by jazz and African dance.
This season's programs pair the American Ann Reinking's jazzy
``Ritmo y Ruido'' with the Spaniard Ramon Oller's highly theatrical
works ``Good Night, Paradise'' and ``Bury Me Standing.''
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of a Mexican matador and a Puerto Rican
schoolteacher, Ms. Ramirez, who spent her early years in Venezuela
before coming to New York, is a good example of the Hispanic mix.
``From my father I learned to appreciate grace, since the bullfight
is a dance,'' she says, ``and from my mother I learned respect for
education.''
</P>
<P>
   She takes her place at the far end of the studio. Small and trim
in black slacks and a white silk blouse, her dark gray hair pulled
back from her delicate face, in her mid-60s she still carries
herself like a dancer. Studies with the legendary Spanish dancer
Lola Bravo, the Russian ballerina Alexandra Danilova and the
Polish-American choreographer Anna Sokolow and years performing
with the Hispanic troupe of Federico Rey left their mark.
</P>
<P>
   She clicks a button on the boom box, and on comes the jazz
pianist Eddie Palmieri's rambunctious score for Rousseve's
``Somethin' From Nothin'.'' Feet start tapping. In couples and
alone, the dancers strut and slink to the center of the room,
projecting despair in spite of their robust sensuality. ``Why is
everybody so down?'' asks a dancer. Slowly, impelled by the music,
their spirits seem to soar. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rousseve's inspiration came from Palmieri's music and from
hearing parts of ``Remembering Slavery,'' a series of early
20th-century recorded interviews collected by Ira Berlin, read on
National Public Radio. ``I show how people who supposedly have
nothing find joy in very simple things, such as dancing,'' Rousseve
explains. This is his second piece for Ballet Hispanico; he
choreographed ``When Dreams Explode'' for the company in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like exploring the intersection of Hispanic and African
cultures,'' he says, ``and these dancers understand. Most
importantly, they're passionate about dancing.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the piece ends, Ms. Ramirez makes her way from one dancer
to another, offering suggestions; sometimes simply asking for a
tilt of the head or a higher extension. She takes Alessandra
Corona's hand and places it on her hip. Then, assuming the same
position herself, she thrusts her shoulder forward and immediately
adds more bravado. All this coaching is accomplished with the
utmost seriousness. But as she leaves the troupe to talk to her
guests, she's smiling. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``What's so wonderful in the last section,'' Ms. Ramirez says,
``is that you're seeing every dancer's own version of salsa.
There's Pedro's Cuban style.'' She brings her arms in close to her
chest, rises on her toes, swivels her hips and demonstrates Cuban
salsa.
</P>
<P>
   In quick succession, she follows with the Puerto Rican salsa of
Eric Rivera, the Venezuelan salsa of Hector Montero and, laughing,
the Korean salsa of Jae-Man Joo, capturing the nuances of each one.
``You don't have to be Hispanic to feel Hispanic,'' she says.
``It's an organic culture, a welcoming culture.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She picks up a notebook filled with sketches for the costumes
for Rousseve's piece, sexy wraparound dresses and hip-hugging
pants, all in vibrant colors. ``This is what kids are wearing,''
she says. ``They spend nothing and yet look great. So we're using
the same styles. We're in touch with real life.''
</P>
<P>
   Jody Arnhold, chairman of the Ballet Hispanico board, nods in
agreement. ``Tina's a part of the neighborhood, a part of the
public schools and a part of the world,'' says Ms. Arnhold. ``She's
deeply connected to society.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ramirez returns to her post at the end of the room and
starts the music for Ruiz's work, played by the Cuban groups Los
Activos and Conjunto Cespedes Vitier. A company member since 1985,
Ruiz makes his choreographic debut with ``Guajira,'' a celebration
of the hard-working women who live in rural Cuba. ``When I was a
child growing up in Havana, I'd go to the country on Sundays with
my grandfather,'' he says. ``The people there spent all their lives
on the land. Many of their traditions came from Africa. My ballet
recalls that way of life.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He paints a picture of people whose pleasures are simple but
intense; whose bodies easily combine with nature. In one scene the
men and women prepare the ground for planting, and in another the
women bend over, scrubbing clothes in a stream. Skillfully, Ruiz
conveys how work and flirtation bind the people together.
</P>
<P>
   It's a piece close to his heart. For the backdrop, he
commissioned a mural of rolling green countryside under a sea-blue
sky, ``just as I remember it,'' he says. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Ruiz's sunny piece, Ms. Miranda's takes a
clear-eyed look at the decadence of contemporary Rio de Janeiro,
using a dissonant score by Damaso Cerruti and Vinicius Brazil.
Named after one of the city's main arteries, ``Avenida Brasil,''
the work presents a series of explosively violent scenes, many
using movements from the Brazilian martial art capoeira.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to give an aerial view of the street, a glimpse of
many personal stories,'' says Ms. Miranda. ``People have a tourist
idea of Brazil; I want to show something truer.''
</P>
<P>
   Trained in dance theater, she first brought her own ensemble,
Regina Miranda Actors and Dancers Company, to the United States in
1997. It was then that Ms. Ramirez saw the company perform at St.
Mark's Church in New York.
</P>
<P>
   After the guests leave, the hard work of refining the pieces
begins. Ms. Ramirez shows no sign of flagging as she prepares to
put in a few more hours. She spent her morning handling
administration, and all week she has attended dance concerts in the
evening, on the lookout for interesting choreographers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making a connection with what's going on right now is very
important to me,'' she says. ``I think that's why audiences
everywhere are so drawn to us. We reflect what they know of life _
the difficulties and the joys.''
</P>
<P>
   A few students pause at the door to watch. As they leave, she
says, ``Dance offers them so much _ pride, discipline, focus.''
Someone in the studio turns on the Palmieri music and, subtly
moving her shoulders and hips, she walks in rhythm back to her
dancers.

   &UR; ABALONE  &LR; _ Abalone farming isn't the quickest way to make a
buck. Although the rock-clinging mollusk is in short supply and its
meat fetches $60 or more per pound, the seaweed-munching mollusks
grow at a snail's pace. It takes at least three years of care and
feeding to grow a modest 3-incher in captivity. To fetch a greater
return, US Abalone of Santa Cruz County, also known as US Abs, is
muscling into a new market with its abalone pearls. The Davenport
aquaculture company, which grows abalone in beachside tanks, has
just printed a catalog for its cultured abalone pearls fashioned by
Carmel's Crossroads Jewelers and plans to sell them from its Web
site (www.usabalone.com). By Peter Sinton

 &UR; COMDEX  &LR; _ ``Internet appliances'' are the talk of the town in Las

appliance'' _ refer to Internet-access devices that are simpler and
cheaper than PCs. The idea has been talked about for several years,
but at this week's Comdex computer trade show, it has moved front
and center. That's mainly because the biggest players in the PC
industry, starting with Microsoft, Compaq and soon Dell, are
getting into the game. Starting next year, they are hoping to
market such contraptions to the 50 percent or so of U.S. households
that have so far resisted the charms of the PC _ and to put them in
the kitchens and bedrooms of families who already have a computer

 &UR; GAS _  &LR; Gas prices in the Bay Area have come down nearly a dime in

the California State Automobile Association said yesterday. Higher
crude oil prices, meanwhile, may mean that pump prices have gone as
low as they'll go for the time being. The average price for a
gallon of unleaded regular gas in the Bay Area dropped 8 cents
since October, to $1.45, the automobile association reported. The
Northern California average fell 6 cents, to $1.43, while the
nationwide average slid only a penny, to $1.28. By David Lazarus

 New Levi's CEO Resizing Staff For a Better Fit  &HT;     By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Philip Marineau, Levi Strauss &AMP; Co.'s new chief executive, has
initiated a sweeping shakeup at the San Francisco jeansmaker.jeans
maker. &LR;
<P>
   &LR;  In an internal memo obtained by The the  &LR; Chronicle, Marineau
Marinea  &LR; outlined plans to replace top managers and to fuse some
U.S. and global functions, a process that will result in an
undetermined number of layoffs. Most of the changes are effective
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   In his six weeks on the job, Marineau said he learned that ``we
have leadership and operational issues, especially within the
Americas, that must be fixed as soon as possible to deliver next
year's business plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, ``we need to staff the organization at the
appropriate size to match our level of sales,'' said the memo,
which Levi's staff received late Monday. Levi's sales have been
falling precipitously for three years.
</P>
<P>
   Without mincing words, Marineau announced that John Ermatinger,
president of the Americas division, and Rob Holloway, vice
president of marketing for the United States, will be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``While John and Rob are both highly skilled professionals, it
is my assessment that they do not have the level of experience and
track record in their current roles to accomplish what we need to
be successful,'' Marineau stated in the memo.
</P>
<P>
   Ermatinger and Holloway did not return telephone calls
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   In a move to cut costs, Levi's will combine the U.S. and global
divisions of three departments: marketing, finance and information
systems. Other departments, such as human resources, have already
merged.
</P>
<P>
   Layoff decisions will be made within each department, so it is
not clear how many jobs will be lost, said Levi's spokesman Jeff
Beckman.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic changes initiated by Marineau demonstrate that he
``is setting a direction for this company, which has been
fundamentally directionless for quite a while,'' one former Levi's
executive said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Both the personnel changes and restructuring should strengthen
the company, said the executive, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Marineau was in meetings and unavailable for comment, Beckman
said.
</P>
<P>
   When Marineau joined the company, he told The the  &LR; Chronicle
that he planned to work as much as possible with the existing
management team. But the top ranks at Levi's are starting to look
radically different.
</P>
<P>
   Marineau will run the Americas division until a replacement
search  &LR; for Ermatinger is found.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, James Capon, a marketing vice president, has been
promoted to president of the Levi's brand in the United States U.S.
 &LR; and Bobbi Silten, marketing director for Slates, will become
president of the Dockers and Slates brands for the United
States.U.S. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Larry Ruff, the vice president of global marketing, will head
the new marketing team, while Janie Ligon, vice president of
direct-to-consumer marketing, will retire. Ruff's duties will be
expanded to include consumer relations, Web marketing, licensing
and publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Glick, the company's chief information officer, will run
the information systems effort while Tom Kasten, a vice president,
will retire.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Moreno, a senior vice president and general counsel, will
manage both the corporate and Americas legal departments. He will
also run Levi's Latin America operations until a new Americas
America's  &LR; president is found.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Goya, senior vice president of human resources, is
retiring after 30 years but will stay until her replacement is
found.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's is also searching for a head of global sourcing, a new
position that will centrally coordinate materials purchasing and
clothing manufacturing. Currently Levi's U.S., European and Asian
arms source products separately, competing against each other
instead of working together to get the best deals.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Marineau announced the impending departure of chief
marketing officer Gordon Shank, a 25-year company veteran whose job
became redundant when Marineau joined.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the personnel changes, Marineau said Levi's needs to
fix its ``go to market process,'' which includes ``everything from
product design right through to the presentation of our brands at
retail.''
</P>
<P>
   Capon and Karen Hanna, vice president of human resources in the
Americas, will develop recommendations for improving this process.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for fiscal year 2000, which Marineau helped develop, ``are
realistic and deliverable, and they will enable us to stabilize the
business, honor our financial commitments and reward employees for
their performance,'' Marineau said in the memo.

 Bay Area Prices Fall 8 Cents In Auto Association Survey  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Gas prices in the Bay Area have come down nearly a dime in the past
month, but are still well above last year at this time, the
California State Automobile Association said yesterday.
<P>
   Higher crude oil prices, meanwhile, may mean that pump prices
have gone as low as they'll go for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   The average price for a gallon of unleaded regular gas in the
Bay Area dropped 8 cents since October, to $1.45, the automobile
association reported. The Northern California average fell 6 cents,
to $1.43, while the nationwide average slid only a penny, to $1.28.
</P>
<P>
   Northern California motorists still pay the highest prices in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Competition here just isn't as intense as other places,'' said
Paul Moreno, a spokesman for the association. ``On the horizon, we
have higher oil prices, which will have an impact at the pump.''
</P>
<P>
   Crude oil hit its highest price in almost three years yesterday,
trading for $25.70 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Crude oil prices have more than doubled this year and are up 18
percent this month alone amid cutbacks in output by oil-producing
nations.
</P>
<P>
   While the automobile association's statistics won't reflect this
trend until next month, the U.S. Department of Energy said Monday
that its weekly survey showed the nationwide average gas price
rising to a six-week high of $1.25 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   The California Energy Commission, meanwhile, said the statewide
average for regular unleaded rose slightly in the last week to
$1.34.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Glaviano, the commission's petroleum analyst, said it looks
like California gas prices may settle near current levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're probably reaching a level where we shouldn't expect
prices to drop much lower,'' he said. ``They may be bottoming
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Since October, San Francisco has seen one of the steepest drops
in gas prices, with the average cost down 11 cents, to $1.51,
according to the automobile association. A year ago, the city's
drivers were paying just $1.27 at the pump.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose's average gas price slid 7 cents since October to
$1.44, compared with $1.14 a year ago, and Oakland's average also
declined 7 cents, to $1.47, compared with $1.20 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Northern California's most expensive gas is Gas is most &LR; 
expensive  &LR; in the Lake Tahoe area, where the average gallon runs
$1.56, down just 3 cents from October but still considerably higher
than last year's $1.19.
</P>
<P>
   The north state's cheapest gas is in Chico, with the average
gallon costing $1.32, down 9 cents from October but up from last
year's $1.12.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, the cheapest gas is in the Southeast, where the
average gallon sells for a mere $1.19.
</P>
<P>
   California gas prices outpace the national average in part due
to the state's stringent environmental regulations, which require
cleaner-burning fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Pump prices soared to record high levels this summer due to high
demand and a series of snafus at state refineries, which reduced
production levels.

</P>
<P>
   Several other firms have set up Internet sites to link investors
with private companies looking for capital. Hambrecht said it is
the only online company to give individuals a chance to participate
as partners in venture capital and private equity investments the
firm itself makes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not just an agent for these companies. We're principal
investors ourselves,'' said J.D. Delafield, Hambrecht's director of
private equity.
</P>
<P>
   The firm, founded two years ago by Bill Hambrecht, who
previously headed the San Francisco investment bank Hambrecht &AMP;
Quist, has already raised nearly $27 million in 16 private equity
deals. Until Hambrecht started promoting its private equity program
on it Web site recently, participation was limited to a select list
of core clients.
</P>
<P>
   Private stock deals, especially in the cases of young companies
with scant track records, are highly risky. And, because there are
no public markets for a company's stock, investors have practically
no way of converting their shares into cash if they need money in
an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, the Securities and Exchange Commission only
lets accredited investors take part in private equity transactions.
To be approved, investors must have $1million in net worth or
annual income of $200,000 for individuals and $300,000 for couples.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At WNYC's office, on the 25th floor of the handsome
old Municipal Building in Lower Manhattan, volunteers are hunched
over the telephones in the rotunda, a drab space that belies its
grand moniker, frantically responding to listeners pledging money.
</P>
<P>
   Even fortified with coffee and bagels, they look tired.
Reporters in the news department, usually out chasing down stories,
alternate with staff members like Mark Hilan, local host of
``Morning Edition,'' and Fred Child, musical and cultural director,
to plead unashamedly for desperately needed support. These are the
final hours of the station's recent fund-raising drive.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to make sure WNYC (93.9 FM and 820 AM) remains a
bastion of creative public broadcasting, and chances look good.
This was the first regular drive that broke the $1 million barrier
in contributions.
</P>
<P>
   As the station celebrates its 75th anniversary, it faces not
only continued high payments for its broadcasting license but a
backbreaking 200 percent hike in charges from National Public Radio
for syndication of several programs, including the acclaimed news
and feature series ``Morning Edition'' and ``All Things
Considered.'' The miracle is that they seem to be pulling it off.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, the last day turned out nicely, with the actor Paul
Newman phoning in on his drive into Manhattan to offer a $25,000
grant from Newman's Own, his foundation. Another listener called to
say that a musical broadcast she heard on WNYC in 1933 had inspired
her to become a concert violinist.
</P>
<P>
   Since WNYC has a history that includes coverage of a ticker tape
parade in 1927 for the Arctic explorer Richard E. Byrd, Mayor
Fiorello La Guardia reading the Sunday comics to children in the
1940s and Bob Dylan's radio debut (in 1961 on Oscar Brand's ``Folk
Song Festival,'' a show that continues to this day), it's not
surprising that fund drives inspire calls from people with
sentimental connections to the station.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone here is used to them. The drives come three times a
year, and employees seem to get a charge out of interacting with
the audience and watching the donations mount on the computer
screens.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is the price of doing exciting programs,'' says Mark
McDonald, managing editor of news and information, ``it's well
worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   There had been concern about the station since 1995 when Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani made good on his threat to sell WNYC Radio and TV
to help relieve the city's expected $2.3 billion budget gap. Dow
Jones/ITT quickly bought the television station for $203 million
but didn't take the radio station.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in an overwhelming show of support, nearly 28,000
listeners pledged a remarkable $1.4 million during a four-day drive
to keep the station independent and commercial-free.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe no one had realized just how important WNYC had become to
its audience. A board member who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, a donor of millions of dollars to WNYC since its
independence, says he wasn't willing to see ``a station so plugged
into the city and the world converted into another commercial
station with generic programming.''
</P>
<P>
   A board, including Wilma S. Tisch, Jerry Della Femina, Peter H.
Darrow and Lally Weymouth, negotiated a $20 million license
purchase to be paid over six years. In January, the fourth of six
payments comes due; so far, so good.
</P>
<P>
   The split with the New York City government carried with it
another significant change. No longer would the mayor appoint
WNYC's president. In 1995, the board elected Laura Walker, a former
Children's Television Workshop producer, to the job.
</P>
<P>
   At home in Brooklyn Heights on maternity leave until January,
she maintains regular contact with the station between feedings of
her 2-month-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walker, who is 41, has quickly made her mark, proving that
the station can be innovative, even while burdened with heavy
costs. Under her leadership, WNYC, which was already the most
popular of all local public stations has increased its listenership
from 800,000 to more than one million.
</P>
<P>
   Membership has grown by 60 percent, with contributions rising
almost 100 percent, from $5.5 million to more than $10 million last
year. She has also managed to attract a huge increase in corporate
support from institutions as diverse as Chase Bank, MBG Classics
and Talkcity.com (one of a variety of contributing Silicon Valley
firms).
</P>
<P>
   Already the development of a Web site, WNYC.org, has become an
important new way to give programming a lengthy shelf life and
attract another audience. In 1998, $19,000 was pledged via the Web;
in 1999, $51,000.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Ms. Walker initiated the station's first gala
fund-raising dinner, which brought in $750,000. Earlier this month,
three devoted WNYC listeners _ the network television news anchors
Tom Brokaw, Peter Jennings and Dan Rather _ were hosts of the
second gala, bringing in more than $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   All these gains have helped offset the loss of the city's annual
$1.5 million support and the station has balanced its $16.9 million
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Now, along with the hefty payments still due on the purchase
price, the station has to find the revenue to pay NPR's alarming
increases. In 2000, those fees jump to $1.9 million (up from
$640,000 in 1996). Once based on total station revenues, these
charges are now determined by the number of listeners. So the more
successful the station is, the more it has to pay.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To deal with NPR's new policy, Ms. Walker spearheaded the
formation of the Major Market Partnership, a group of executives
from the 10 major public stations. ``Specifically,'' she says,
``we're working with NPR to phase in the new dues structure and to
make certain the value of the local stations' audience is
understood as a part of NPR's national underwriting efforts.''
Which means making sure they recognize the local stations'
contribution to their success.
</P>
<P>
   NPR's president, Kevin Klose, says the current fee arrangement
was not meant to be permanent. ``This is not the end of the
story,'' he says. ``However, the reason we changed our policy is
that the current one more directly reflects the value NPR programs
have brought to the station in terms of listener numbers. It is
still fairer than the previous system, which was based on station
revenues. In fact, as many stations complained about the old system
as complain about this one. We're hoping to put something into
effect more satisfactory to all the stations within a year.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation with NPR may be unsettled, but the direction of
WNYC's programming is not. Proudly, Ms. Walker mentions
already-proven shows like Brian Lehrer's news programs ``On the
Media'' and ``On the Line''; Leonard Lopate's 14-year-old ``New
York and Company,'' on which a week's guest list might include
Henry Kissinger, the artist Chuck Close, the opera star Christa
Ludwig, the singer Barry White and the author John Updike; and John
Schaefer's ``New Sounds,'' created in 1982, which introduces new
music, underwrites live concerts and commissions pieces.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the changes. Jonathan Schwartz, the radio
personality who began proselytizing for Frank Sinatra and American
standards on New York radio in 1967, just joined WNYC with shows on
Saturday and Sunday nights. In the news and information division,
documentaries are becoming integral.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the reporter-producer team of Beth Fertig and
Jane Bryant Johnson are in Zimbabwe gathering material for a
documentary on how HIV-positive African immigrants to the United
States seek treatments for their relatives and friends in Africa. A
news reporter, Amy Eddings, is working on a three-part series,
``The Juggling Act,'' to be broadcast in January, about how
families cope in a world of multiple demands.
</P>
<P>
   WNYC plans three new shows in the next six months. Starting in
late January, ``Satellite Sisters'' takes to the air in four test
markets, including New York. The one-hour show, scheduled for
Saturdays, is a five-way conversation among five sisters who live
around the country and abroad, dealing with what one sister calls
``real life as the soap opera it really is.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming in the spring are ``The Next Big Thing,'' with the former
NPR cultural reporter Dean Olsher as host and producer, and a
series with Kurt Andersen, the New Yorker writer and former editor
in chief of New York magazine, as host.
</P>
<P>
   Both shows will examine culture in its broadest sense.
Andersen's show, still untitled, is being developed by Susan
Morris, who produced arts programming for the BBC and Bravo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to show how the arts are embedded in our lives,'' says
Ms. Morris. ``I learned that there's a music programmer on Air
Force One,'' she says. ``Well, I became interested in who he was
and whether Bill and Hillary had different tastes and if certain
music was played after and before certain events.''
</P>
<P>
   She paused. ``I'm also trying to find out why so many opera
singers like golf.''

 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The night view stretches forever from the terrace of
the 16th-floor duplex on Central Park West. Inside, it's the
proverbial telephone booth. In the center of a room about 20 feet
square, Mary Tyler Moore practices throwing her left hook while
she, Valerie Harper and a film crew patiently work around one
another, setting up for the next scene.
</P>
<P>
   Space is tight, but this is ridiculous. Is there room for the
camera? Furniture is removed. Lose the couch.
</P>
<P>
   From 1970 to 1977, as Mary Richards and Rhoda Morgenstern, Ms.
Moore and Ms. Harper made ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' one of the
most successful series in television history. Now they are back
together making ``Mary and Rhoda,'' a television movie that began
as an idea for a series and may yet lead to one.
</P>
<P>
   References to the possibility of a new show often enter their
talk, but for now the focus is clear. ``We want to feel we've made
the best movie we can,'' Ms. Moore said the other day.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, which ABC expects to show early next year, Mary and
Rhoda reconnect in New York, where they both have daughters in
college. Mary has lived in the city for years and is the widow of a
congressman who died five months ago. Rhoda, a native New Yorker,
has returned from Paris. Having divorced her philandering French
husband, she wants to pursue her interest in photography and be
near her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moore came up with the major plot elements herself. In fact,
she put the project together herself, which is not the kind of
thing she used to do in the old days with ``The Mary Tyler Moore
Show'' or with her company MTM Productions, which was run by her
former husband Grant Tinker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did zip,'' she said. ``I was chairman of the board.'' On the
set she was on a kind of automatic pilot. ``I never had to get
involved in the acting because the show was so brilliantly written.
It was like a perfect cake put before me every week. I never had to
reach for moments. I instinctively knew how to act them.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago she proposed a new series. ``It didn't fly,'' she
said. Even seasoned writers couldn't get by the aura and mystique
of the old show to create characters who were familiar yet totally
different people in a completely changed world facing entirely new
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the same character,'' said Ms. Moore, who will turn 63
next month. But writers kept sinking back into the old
characterizations.
</P>
<P>
   ABC turned down the series but backed the movie. ``The series
died because they never got scripts they thought were sharp enough
to bring those characters back,'' said Susan Lyne, the network's
executive vice president for movies and mini-series.
</P>
<P>
   Katie Ford, who wrote the film, said the two-hour format gave
Mary and Rhoda breathing room to re-establish themselves as new
people in fresh lives. ``To give credit to anyone who attempted it
as a series, I don't think I could have done that in a half-hour,''
she said. In a movie, the memory of ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show''
needn't hang quite so heavily. ``We're trying to move on from that,
not be reminiscent, because it's important to see who they'd be
now.''
</P>
<P>
   The film is directed by Barnet Kellman, the director of ``Murphy
Brown'' among other shows and films. ```The Mary Tyler Moore
Show,''' he said, ``gave us a character who was starting over,
taking chances. That's what energized the series. What I like about
this story is that it puts Mary in that position again later in
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Kellman and Ms. Moore credit much of the character development
to Ms. Ford, 34, who began her career as a stand-up comic at 14 and
has written for ``Family Ties'' and other series and been a writer
and producer in Canadian television. ``There was one initial phone
call from Mary,'' she said. ``We came from the same place about
where we wanted to approach it. Her instincts are unbelievable. She
gave me a lot of confidence and made me want to do it well for her
because she had such a great eye.''
</P>
<P>
   In the duplex scene Mary Richards punches the air in
satisfaction over having stood up for herself in a messy situation.
``I don't want to play familiar roles,'' Ms. Moore said. ``I want
to play people who make my palms sweat.''
</P>
<P>
   In the old days Mary Richards was an independent young woman,
but in the movie she faces a new reality in which independence
imposes an updated set of demands. The congressman, a good fellow
all around, made some bad financial decisions and now Mary needs a
job. Or as Ms. Moore put it, ``I'm 60; I haven't worked in eight
years; is there hope for me?''
</P>
<P>
   She and Ms. Ford developed the story together. ``One of the
first things I said to Mary was that I really wanted this to be a
drama, because to me that's the only way to explain the 20 years we
haven't seen and the only way the comedy will work for me,'' Ms.
Ford said. ``As a drama it's just easier to do.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In its potential for intimidation, New York is as much a part of
the story of two women, now of a certain age, starting their lives
over as Minneapolis was for Mary and Rhoda when they first became
friends in their early 30s. The entire film has been shot in the
city, a rarity for a television movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``You pay a price for the beauty and texture of New York,''
Kellman said. ``You're in practical locations. In a New York
apartment you can't move the wall. If the camera is jammed in the
corner five feet away, you have to use a wide-angle lens, which
catches everything it sees. You're dealing with reality all the
time, which is great when it gets on screen but it's hard to get it
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Mary Richards lands a position with a television news
station run by Jonah Seimeir, played by Elon Gold, a man in his
early 30s who bears absolutely no resemblance to Lou Grant (Ed
Asner), the gruff, traditional newsman whom Mary worked for on the
old show in the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's smart, glib and attractive in a way that makes him both
distrustful and substantial,'' Kellman said. At one point Mary
accuses him of hiring her to defuse claims of age discrimination
arising from a situation with Cecile Andrews, played by Christine
Ebersole, an anchorwoman in her late 40s. Jonah freely admits that
that is indeed the main reason he hired Mary.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way Mary and Lou have switched roles,'' Kellman said.
``Mary is representative of those old values she learned at that
station in Minneapolis. This kid is the product of contemporary
media savvy, cynicism and business reality. At the same time, which
is really challenging, the guy's not a fool or a cartoon.''
</P>
<P>
   And what has become of Rhoda? ``The old Rhoda was waiting for a
man to stamp her valid,'' said Ms. Harper, 59. No more. ``She has
grown much more confident over the years in that she's unwilling to
stay in a marriage that is not a good one. She's still the same
spirit, still has the New York accent. She's had her baby in her
late 30s so she's pretty well formed up. Rhoda is suffering a bit
of empty nest. She's coming home, she wants to be near her
daughter, who's seeking her own life, so that's delicate. She likes
to be needed, wants to be loved.''
</P>
<P>
   Central to the film, of course, are the two daughters, who help
their mothers bridge the more than 20 years they have been gone
from ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' and bring them into the present.
Both are loyal but strive for independence. Mary's daughter, Rose,
played by Joie Lenz, wants to leave college to be a stand-up comic.
The mothers are given formidable young women to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   ``The daughters help them be different people,'' said Marisa
Ryan, who plays Rhoda's daughter, Meredith, a pre-med student at
Columbia. ``She's trying to be on her own, get out of Rhoda's
grasp, deal with the divorce. She's very close to her dad, and
Rhoda's constantly vocalizing how she loathes him. Actually she's
more like Mary, more studious, focused, more of a go-getter. She
has the humor, but she's more strait-laced than Rhoda.''
</P>
<P>
   All told, these sound like solid characters for a new series.
ABC won't comment on the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be able to do a two-hour movie is just right,'' Ms. Lyne
said. ``It gives you a chance to see who they've become and how
they act in a world that has changed dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   Later there will be time to consider other possibilities, as
Kellman pointed out. ``The movie has to be a stand-alone,'' he
said, ``but I was also careful in the writing and casting to make
sure it worked as a setup for a series. You want to give the other
characters their due. In a movie they can be straw men or props,
but in a series they have to be interesting enough to see them in
the round, in that you'll want to see their foibles and the
difficulties they present to the central characters.''
</P>
<P>
   A bonding between the daughters might be an appropriate
development. Ms. Ford, like others around the film, is closemouthed
about details in the script. ``Part of the fun,'' she said, ``will
be the surprise of what that's like.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Michaels is managing his frustration in the back seat of a
limousine on the way to Foxboro, Mass. The ``Monday Night
Football'' announcer's trip from Boston to the Jets-Patriots game
on Monday is 90 minutes old and not over.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could have quite a story,'' he says, in his familiar,
resonant timbre. ``We went to two-in-the-booth. Tonight, could be
one-in-the-booth.''
</P>
<P>
   He scans his notes, then leafs through The Boston Herald,
reading headlines aloud _ all about Jets Coach Bill Parcells:
```Tuna on the Menu,' `Tuna Hopes to Save Face.''' He pauses. ``I
had some very nice tuna tartare last night.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he sees a distant nimbus of light. ``The good news
is, I see stadium lights,'' he says. ``The bad news is, it's the
Yale Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's shabby Foxboro Stadium, site of the 10th game in
``Monday Night's'' 30th season. Except for ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire?'' ``Monday Night'' is currently ABC's highest rated
prime-time program, and its most expensive, at $550 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the garrulous Boomer Esiason, in his second season
beside Michaels in the booth, schmoozes players on the field, then
walks briskly up a ramp toward the booth. ``Hey, Boomer, who's the
best player in football?'' a security guard asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was, until I retired,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now it's Drew Bledsoe, right?'' the guard asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure is,'' says Esiason.
</P>
<P>
   There are no apparent jitters for Michaels in his 14th season as
the lead voice of the show or for Esiason. Each game affirms
Michaels' status as one of the best play-by-play announcers in pro
football, but it is a test for Esiason as the solo analyst, no
longer the junior partner to Dan Dierdorf, whom ABC discarded last
winter in a pay dispute. If Esiason is struggling to be provocative
or to reinvent himself with a shtick, he does not admit it. ``The
game is what it's all about,'' he says. ``Not what I say.''
</P>
<P>
   The Foxboro booth is cramped, with hot lights, one camera
looking in and another looking out, cables spread on the floor like
nerve ganglia carrying the game's impulses to America and a black
curtain backlighted with ``New York'' in green lights and ``New
England'' in light red.
</P>
<P>
   Downstairs, inside ABC's production truck, the director, Craig
Janoff, and the producer, Ken Wolfe, transform a jigsaw puzzle of
22 cameras and 18 replay machines into ABC's prime-time broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   There is a desire, articulated by Michaels, to call great games,
or at least competitive ones. When he examined this season's
schedule, he thought it was the best since he moved into the
``Monday Night'' booth in 1986. But four teams _ Denver, Minnesota,
Atlanta and the Jets _ that appeared in their conference
championship games last season and were scheduled three times
apiece on ``Monday Night'' this season have been disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   Amid Wolfe's quiet pregame preparations, he is slightly
distracted by one monitor among dozens before him by
``Millionaire'' _ ``best lead-in we've ever had,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The broadcast starts with typical high energy: exploding
graphics, a short skit starring the cast of ABC's ``The Practice''
that tailors one of their signature scenes to the Jets-Patriots
matchup, and the theme song by Hank Williams Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The first quarter is scoreless, as Jets quarterback Ray Lucas
relies mainly on rushing plays by Curtis Martin. Esiason suggests
that Parcells expand to play-action passes. Excitement is limited,
except for a melee after a New England interception on a tipped
Lucas pass near the end of the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Janoff leaps from his seat to orchestrate the camera coverage,
as Wolfe views the replays and relays the best ones to Janoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had worse quarters,'' Michaels says during commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least it's 0-0,'' says Esiason.
</P>
<P>
   The game will not provide Esiason with the type of thematic road
map he followed a month ago, during the Dallas-Giants game at
Giants Stadium. Throughout, he criticized Giants Coach Jim Fassel
and Cowboys Coach Chan Gailey for timid play-calling.
</P>
<P>
   But in praising a Jets play, in which the receiver Keyshawn
Johnson catches a pass on a pattern in which he follows behind
Wayne Chrebet, Esiason says: ``Flood the zones and create
illusions. That's what Charlie Weis is doing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Reflectively,'' Michaels says, a cryptic reminder that while
Weis is the Jets offensive coordinator, Parcells calls the plays.
</P>
<P>
   In the truck, Janoff cajoles his cameramen into a heightened
alertness to on-field developments. But you would have to climb
inside his brain to comprehend his spatial vision: monitors
carrying feeds from 22 cameras, arranged in mostly illogical order,
camera 13 next to 15, camera 17 beside 11, camera 14 abutting 12,
camera 8 bordering 1. In this way, Janoff takes apart and
reassembles the field, cutting shots over a thousand times in three
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Janoff speaks a dialect known only to directors and cameramen.
He calls out cameras by their numbers, whether he is following a
play or looking for a player on the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isolate Keyshawn, 19,'' he says. ``Parcells, 5. Five, to
Parcells. Take 2'' _ a view from above the 50-yard line _ ``5, 4,
14, 1, 10, 9, 11, 7. Wide on the sideline. Someone show me
McGinest! In blue!''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Janoff's exhortations, the truck is calm. Wolfe relays
his instructions to Michaels and Esiason in tones that are nearly
inaudible three feet behind him. ``Craig's high octane because he's
moving the cameras,'' Wolfe says, ``but it's better for me to talk
in relaxed tones.''

 Genentech Offers to Settle UC Patent Row
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Tom Abate and Tanya Schevitz &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Chronicle Staff Writers &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Genentech has offered to pay the University of California $200
million to settle allegations that 20 years ago, scientists working
for the biotech giant spirited a patented DNA sample out of a UC
lab and used the specimen to develop a top-selling growth hormone
drug.
</P>
<P>
   UC and Genentech declined to comment on the proposed settlement,
which is scheduled for a vote before the UC Board of Regents
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, the deal would settle a case that UC filed in 1990
and nearly won at a trial this summer. A settlement would let both
sides avoid the risk and expense of a retrial, which was slated to
begin in January.
</P>
<P>
   Although terms of the settlement have not been released, an
informed source said UC general counsel James Holst sent out a memo
on Monday outlining Genentech's offer to pay UC $150 million in
cash and to spend an additional $50 million to erect a building on
the university's new research campus at San Francisco's Mission
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The memo calls the $50 million a gift that would let Genentech
propose a name for the building.
</P>
<P>
   Legal observers called the offer a huge victory for UC and one
of the largest patent infringement settlements in history.
</P>
<P>
   John Storella, a San Francisco patent attorney, said that for UC
to get a settlement that large ``without the risk of a trial
represents a great deal'' for the university.
</P>
<P>
   Although the agreement would cost Genentech more than its 1998
profit of $182 million, Genentech's shares rose 6 percent yesterday
as news of the settlement leaked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a significant amount of money, but Genentech can afford
it,'' said Carol Werther, a biotechnology stock analyst in New
York. ``It's better for shareholders to have Genentech put this
lawsuit behind it.''
</P>
<P>
   If the regents approve the current arrangement, it would mark
the second time this year that Genentech has made a large payment
to settle alleged improprieties involving Protropin, a drug
developed for children who are abnormally small because of hormone
deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Genentech agreed to pay $50 million to end a Food and
Drug Administration probe into allegations that during the late
1980s and early 1990s, it had encouraged Protropin prescriptions
for children who were short but otherwise healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Although UC did not file suit against Genentech until 1990, the
patent dispute traces its roots to 1978, when several scientists at
UC San Francisco discovered and patented part of the gene in the
body that is used to make human growth hormone.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after that discovery, Genentech, then a fledgling
biotech firm, hired one of those UC scientists, Peter Seeburg, to
join the company in its attempt to develop a growth hormone drug.
Seeburg testified in court earlier this year that he returned to UC
San Francisco on the New Year's Eve after his hiring and took a
sample of the DNA back to Genentech.
</P>
<P>
   Seeburg, now a biochemist at the University of Heidelberg in
Germany, further testified that he and another former Genentech
scientist, David Goeddel, later used UC's sample to help make the
growth hormone gene that became the basis for Genentech's Protropin
drug.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial that ended in June, Genentech acknowledged that
Seeburg had taken the DNA sample from UC, but it said it never used
that sample to develop Protropin.
</P>
<P>
   Goeddel, a respected scientist who left Genentech to found
another South San Francisco biotech firm called Tularik Inc.,
testified that he had independently created a human growth hormone
gene that was different and larger than UC's DNA sample _ so much
different, in fact, that Genentech was granted its own patent for
Goeddel's discovery.
</P>
<P>
   The trial that ended in June never directly addressed the two
scientists' conflicting testimony, but rather zeroed in on the
narrower legal issues of whether Genentech's DNA was substantially
the same as UC's earlier invention and, thus, was a patent
infringement.
</P>
<P>
   But the trial ended in a hung jury when eight jurors voted in
favor of UC and one held out for Genentech.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as one of the ironies of the proposed deal, Seeburg and
four other current or former UC scientists whose names appear on
the patent will earn a share of any settlement under university
rules that split the profits from patented inventions with the
inventors.
</P>
<P>
   Seeburg and the others could collect $20 million each, according
to a Los Angeles Times report that could not be independently
verified. Such a payment to the scientists would leave UC with $50
million in cash and the $50 million building pledge.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement is likely to get a hard look by the regents,
which is one reason UC officials have been tight-lipped about its
terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is nice to get the money,'' said one regent. ``But in one
sense, we came damn close to winning the whole ballgame, so I don't
know how good a settlement this is.''

 UNDATED: relaxed tones.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Upstairs, there is an exhibition of seamless coordination. On
nearly every play, Michaels adjusts his glance from the field to
the monitors and to Kelly Hayes, the spotter, whose right index
finger guides Michaels to his color-coordinated spotter's board
with players' names and statistics. The names emerge from Michaels'
mouth without pause.
</P>
<P>
   Using data from his play-by-play score card, the statistician,
George Hill, writes out yardage gained, time of possession or
timeouts remaining on white index cards that he passes to his
right, usually to Michaels, who frequently leans over during breaks
to ask for information.
</P>
<P>
   Michaels and Esiason stand throughout nearly all the game,
wearing headsets. Sometimes, Esiason turns left to Michaels, bends
his knees and spreads his arms to stress a point. Michaels rarely
turns to his partner. Their gesturing describes an ongoing chat, if
not with themselves, then with viewers. Michaels likens his
gesturing to a band leader's exertions to advance the music.
</P>
<P>
   One member of the crew whose role is a wild card is Lesley
Visser. Cautioned twice by National Football League officials last
month for encroaching beyond the dotted yellow line on the
sideline, Visser is mostly at the mercy of breaking news, injuries,
coaches' revelations _ and the elements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Duchess, how are you doing?'' Michaels asks her during a
break.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm like frozen custard,'' says Visser, who is wearing work
boots over two pairs of socks that are separated by a plastic bag.
</P>
<P>
   This night, the coldest of the season, she never leaves the
field for a break and is barely on camera. ``Better to be seen too
little than too much,'' she says, ``so people are glad to see
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Michaels is clearly the star of the first two-man ``Monday
Night'' booth since 1986. Esiason, with his career as a quarterback
with the Jets, Bengals and Cardinals, his platinum-blond hair and
hulking physique, is more recognizable. But Michaels is more
accomplished: a play-by-play announcer who is part analyst,
offering more than a terse recitation of play and yardage.
</P>
<P>
   To gain an analytic foothold, Esiason is focusing more on what
quarterbacks do, as he works on a broader vision of the field. He's
got a quick, judgmental wit. In comparing Johnson to Minnesota's
Cris Carter, Esiason says: ``Keyshawn Johnson's an arrogant Cris
Carter. He'll tell you how good he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Esiason's smartest call is his rapid detection of a pass
interference call _ in essence, an illegal pick by the Jets Richie
Anderson _ that negates a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Esiason enjoys chiding Michaels, mostly about his partner's love
of The Four Seasons hotel chain, and recently feigned offense when
the stage manager handed Michaels a hot dog before him. ``I know
he's the star and all,'' Esiason said.
</P>
<P>
   One senses that Esiason wants to be known for being
unpredictable. At halftime of last month's Giants-Cowboys game,
Michaels conducted a somber interview with Michael Irvin, the
Dallas receiver who had suffered a spinal injury a week earlier.
Just as the conversation ended, Esiason strode into the booth and
asked loudly, ``Hey, did anybody cry yet?''
</P>
<P>
   During a commercial break on Monday, Esiason says he will be
attending an event this week at the ESPN Zone restaurant. ``I'm
representing `Monday Night Football,' '' he says, with a
characteristic tone of exasperation. ``That's all I do, represent
`Monday Night Football,' without you.''
</P>
<P>
   Michaels responds, ``I'll be representing `Monday Night
Football' at the Canyon Ranch in Tucson.''
</P>
<P>
   The absence of Dierdorf is turning Michaels and Esiason into an
increasingly viable team. They appear to like each other. At one
point, Michaels asks Esiason how long his throat needed to heal
from last week's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wednesday,'' Esiason says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not bad. What did you take for it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe it or not,'' Esiason says, ``I just shut up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets race to a 24-3 lead, but New England closes to 24-17,
behind Bledsoe's touchdown passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``True to form, Drew Bledsoe is sticking it to his old coach,''
Esiason says.
</P>
<P>
   But earlier in the quarter, during a break, he sounded
frustrated by Bledsoe: ``Every week, we get one lousy quarterback
performance.'' Despite the surprise of a Jet victory, it is not an
edge-of-the-seat thriller. The scoring ends midway through the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Michaels and Esiason leave quickly, escorted out of Foxboro by
motorcycle police.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still haven't had a compelling game in a long time,''
Michaels says in the limo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Giants-Buffalo Super Bowl,'' Wolfe says. ``Maybe we should
play the second halves first.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People only remember the end,'' says Michaels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is, they don't remember the end,'' says Wolfe.
``They're asleep.''
</P>
<P>
   The selection of coming games fails to excite Michaels. The
season ends with San Francisco against Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even want to think about it,'' he says. &QL;

 Kendall-Jackson Set to Take on the World  &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
The appointment of former Hewlett-Packard chief executive Lewis
Platt to the helm of Kendall-Jackson at the beginning of next year
is designed to help the biggest North Coast wine producer become
more of a global competitor.
<P>
   It also positions K-J for a possible public stock offering as
early as the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Platt, 58, who was replaced as CEO at HP in July by Carly
Fiorina, retains his chairman title at the nation's second-largest
computer company until December. After that, he said in an
interview, he will move from Los Altos to Sonoma County and begin
his ``second career.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Kendall-Jackson and Hewlett-Packard would not seem to
have much in common aside from their hyphenated names, Platt said
both face similar challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consolidation is taking place in both industries, and both
industries are increasingly global,'' said Platt, who has spent the
past 33 years with HP and the last seven as CEO.
</P>
<P>
   Jess Jackson, the 69-year-old founder and chairman of K-J, said
he was attracted to Platt because of his maturity and worldwide
experience.
</P>
<P>
   In September, K-J also made another key move. It hired Boston
Beer Co. Chief Financial Officer Alfred Rossow to fill the CFO slot
at K-J, which had been vacant for three years. (K-J's previous CFO,
Peter Scott, took a similar position at Beringer, which changed its
name to Beringer Wine Estates and went public.)
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, K-J changed its name last week from
Kendall-Jackson Winery to Kendall Jackson Wine Estates.
</P>
<P>
   ``K-J now has a killer lineup with more public company
experience than either Beringer or Robert Mondavi,'' said David
Freed, a partner of Silverado partners winery and vineyard
investment firm in Napa. ``I would expect an IPO next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Platt declined to say if or when K-J might go public but
acknowledged that a stock offering would ``definitely be one way to
gain more capital to expand.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said, ``Going public is always a consideration, but I'm
not sure the distraction of going public is something we need right
now.'' To go public, he observed, a company must perform
consistently, but in the wine business it is sometimes necessary to
make long-term investments at the expense of short-term profits.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be too negative on the notion of going public, Jackson
quickly added, ``Lew Platt and Al Rossow could take us there in a
blink.'' If K-J decides to do an initial public offering, Jackson
suggested ``it wouldn't be before the end of next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, K-J sold nearly 3.8 million cases of wine for $362
million. The company has more than a dozen brands and owns wineries
in California as well as Argentina, Chile and Italy. But compared
to HP, which gets more than half its $5 billion revenues from
overseas sales, K-J is provincial. More than 90 percent of its
sales are domestic.
</P>
<P>
   Both Jackson and Platt want to make K-J more of a global wine
power.
</P>
<P>
   Although Platt has not toiled previously in the wine field, he
has been a wine fan and collector since moving to California in
1980. For his wife's 50th birthday in 1995, he shelled out $3,000
for a 1945 bottle of Chateau Petrus.

 &HT;    Special counsel seeks custody of shell casings found at Mount
Carmel
 &HT;    By Mark England
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Special Counsel John Danforth asked U.S. District
Judge Walter S. Smith Jr. of Waco Tuesday to grant him temporary
custody of shell casings found in 1993 at a government sniper
position at Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   The request comes after Danforth asked the FBI to turn over all
weapons carried during the Branch Davidian siege.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the Office of the Special Counsel wants to determine
whether the shell casings came from bullets fired by the ATF or the
FBI. The FBI has insisted that its agents did not fire any shots
during the siege.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Rangers' report to Congress in September stated that
the agency recovered a dozen .308-caliber sniper rifle casings and
24 Israeli-made .223-caliber casings from a house across from Mount
Carmel. ATF agents originally used it as an undercover house. FBI
agents later used the house as an observation post and sniper
position.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the FBI's weapons have been retooled, testing the shell
casings could prove productive, according to the lead attorney for
the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may not change the hammer on the firing mechanism,'' said
Houston lawyer Mike Caddell. ``It's the strike mark on the shell
casings that can be analyzed microscopically and determined if
there's a match between any of those shell casings and the weapons
used by the FBI at Mount Carmel on April 19.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI agent in charge of the sniper position was Lon Horiuchi,
who is a defendant in the wrongful death lawsuit filed by surviving
Branch Davidians against the government.
</P>
<P>
   Horiuchi has denied firing any shots at Mount Carmel, although
he admittedly fired the shot that killed Randy Weaver's wife,
Vicki, at Ruby Ridge. An FBI agent, who later recanted his
statement, reported hearing a shot come from the direction of the
sniper position held by Horiuchi on the day of the fire that led to
the deaths of David Koresh and 75 followers.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth _ in a motion filed by Edward L. Dowd Jr., deputy
special counsel _ told Smith that he wanted the shell casings so
that he could have them reviewed by experts and tested.
</P>
<P>
   Monday was the deadline set by Smith for any government agency
to turn over evidence pertaining to the Davidian lawsuit. The case
is set for trial this May.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the shell casings, Danforth asked Smith for a May 1993
report by the Texas Rangers related to the test firing of ATF
weapons; negatives and crime scene photographs taken by the Rangers
or the FBI; the Rangers' plan for recovering evidence at Mount
Carmel; and any Rangers' diary, journal, notes or memorandum
discussing the collection of evidence.

which is one reason UC officials have been tight-lipped about its
terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is nice to get the money,'' said one regent. ``But in one
sense, we came damn close to winning the whole ballgame, so I don't
know how good a settlement this is.''

ADVERTISING: MANY CONSUMERS BRISTLE AT MILLENNIUM HYPE, AGENCY
CONCLUDES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PATRICIA WINTERS LAURO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the countdown to the millennium begins in the advertising
world, one huge global agency has some surprising advice: don't
hype it.
</P>
<P>
   McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising, with worldwide clients
like Coca-Cola, General Motors and Nestle, says surveys of consumer
attitudes show that many are already tired of the hoopla
surrounding the New Year and that promoting it will just create
more background noise.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, some consumers _ mainly outside the United States _
automatically associate the millennium with the Year 2000 computer
problem and serious havoc, not exactly the kind of association an
advertiser wants to make.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was conducted by McCann Pulse, a research service
division of McCann-Erickson, part of the McCann-Erickson World
Group unit of Interpublic Group of Cos. McCann Pulse tries to
determine behavior and attitudes, the better to create advertising
to which consumers will respond.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that for most consumers the millennium has
symbolic and emotional meaning about the future and the past, said
Joseph Plummer, executive vice president and director for global
brands strategy at McCann-Erickson Worldwide in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to a big promotional event like the Super Bowl, the
coming millennium is less about a big party than it is about
feelings that run surprisingly deep. Thus, for all but the most
light-hearted products, to play up the millennium with a big
short-term promotion would miss the point and perhaps even annoy
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, young adults surveyed in the United States, Germany and
the United Kingdom expressed irritation about Year 2000 media hype.
In Britain, in particular, young adults expressed fear that high
prices would prevent them from celebrating the way they would like.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers are expecting the hype _ that will only put you in
the pack with everyone else,'' Plummer said. ``Most of the
associations and feelings around the world have to do with
longer-term hopes and dreams, things like peace on earth and better
education. If that's how consumers are feeling, to run a promotion
for December with a big giveaway belittles it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, true party-oriented products like candy bars can
rightly cash in on the millennium, especially if the promotion is
intended for children, Plummer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a fun product, and you want to just have fun, then
it's fine,'' he said. ``But on a deeper level, we're saying to try
to associate with it in a bigger, more long-term way.''
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, McCann Worldwide urged some clients to sponsor the
Millennium Wheel and the Millennium Dome, both in England, as a way
to associate with the New Year in a positive and meaningful way.
The Millennium Wheel in London is a 1,500-ton Ferris wheel,
offering 25-mile views, that was constructed for the millennium and
will remain a permanent tourist attraction. The Millennium Dome is
a huge exhibition space being constructed in Greenwich, England.
Both are taking corporate sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the kind of thing people really appreciate,'' Plummer
said. ``Both will be there long beyond January, they have
permanence, and are symbols of reviewing the past and looking to
the future.''
</P>
<P>
   McCann began conducting surveys last March in response to client
inquiries about whether to capitalize on the millennium. The survey
included talking to 1,500 people in 19 countries, and was followed
up in August and September with additional questions to another
1,500 people in 21 countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't thinking of asking about it, but in country after
country Y2K came up, so we decided to explore it deeper,'' Plummer
said, referring to the popular designation for Year 2000 computer
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that in countries like the United States there
was a feeling that the issue was being addressed. (This consumer
feeling may account for some advertising here that pokes fun at the
subject.) But respondents in places like Russia and Indonesia
expressed great concern and the advice is to steer clear of any
millennium promotions.
</P>
<P>
   The issue also revealed another simmering consumer view in the
United States: that technology is growing too powerful. In
interviews, consumers even made associations between possible Year
2000 problems and biotechnology, which Plummer said ``really scares
them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology showed up as an Achilles' heel,'' he said.
``There's this sense that we'll get through Y2K but that technology
is pervasive, that its getting too powerful and that it's
worrisome.''
</P>
<P>
   To offset this feeling, Plummer said marketers of technology
brands from equipment manufacturers to high-technology
communications services need to reinforce consumer trust over the
long term. The agency also has recommended that advertisers, even
those not usually associated with possible technical problems,
reassure consumers that they have checked their systems. This
advice seems to be conventional wisdom in the advertising world
given the vast amount of advertising and direct mail addressing the
computer-readiness issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a delicate balance, and it needs to be quite factual,''
said Plummer, adding that companies can only check their systems,
but don't really know what will happen. ``It's extremely important
not to overpromise.''

 Internet Appliances the Hottest Game in Vegas  &HT;     By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Las Vegas _ ``Internet appliances'' are the talk of the town in Las
Vegas this week.
<P>
   The term _ and its virtual synonym, ``information appliance'' _
refer to Internet-access devices that are simpler and cheaper than
PCs. The idea has been talked about for several years, but at this
week's Comdex computer trade show, it has moved front and center.
</P>
<P>
   That's mainly because the biggest players in the PC industry,
starting with Microsoft, Compaq and soon Dell, are getting into the
game. Starting next year, they are hoping to market such
contraptions to the 50 percent or so of U.S. households that have
so far resisted the charms of the PC _ and to put them in the
kitchens and bedrooms of families who already have a computer in
the den or the study.
</P>
<P>
   The products are expected to sell for less than $200. The
up-front cost to the customer could be even less, perhaps nothing
at all: The manufacturers are hoping that phone companies, banks,
health plans and other organizations will purchase the hardware and
lend or rent it at low monthly rates to their customers.
</P>
<P>
   There's already a plethora of devices that qualify, at least by
some definitions, as Internet appliances _ from cell phones with
e-mail and Web-browsing software built in to Java- or Linux-based
``network computers'' intended for corporate desktops.
</P>
<P>
   In between, there are countless variations on the theme:
Palm-style pocket organizers fitted with wired or wireless modems;
dedicated e-mail devices (essentially, keyboards with a modem and a
few inches of screen built in); ``set-top boxes'' that combine the
Net with television; ``screen phones'' that can be used for
ordinary voice calls or for casual surfing; and, in the near
future, ``Web pads,'' clipboard-size contraptions with wireless Web
links.
</P>
<P>
   But the class of appliance that has come front and center this
week is what Microsoft and its minions are calling ``Web
companions.'' To judge by the handful of prototypes on display on
and off the show floor, they will come in a variety of sizes and
shapes. Some, including Compaq's still-nameless prototype and
Acer's I-Station, have notebook-size screens, with the electronics
hidden in a small but bulbous box behind them.
</P>
<P>
   But another Microsoft partner, Vestel USA (the North American
offshoot of a Turkish company that's the second-largest supplier of
TVs in Europe), showed two alternative designs, one with a
flat-panel display and another that looked vaguely like Apple's
iMac or Gateway's new all-in-one PC, the Astro.
</P>
<P>
   What they have in common is, first of all, that the only
software they run is a Web browser, and a simplified one at that:
one window and no toolbars, just a few basic buttons on the screen
and on the special Internet-oriented keyboards that come with them.
</P>
<P>
   Users of such devices will, in principle, be able to go to any
Web destination they desire, but their home page will be preset and
unchangeable _ in the prototypes Microsoft is promoting, it is the
company's MSN Web site, and buttons for services such as news and
shopping are hard-wired hardwired  &LR; to sections of MSN or to
Microsoft partners.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that decide to subsidize and distribute companions to
their own customers will presumably get to set the home page and
button-destinations for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq refuses to say what underlying operating system runs its
prototype (an official said the company may use several in
different models), but the others all run a stripped-down version
of Microsoft's Windows CE, minus the numerous applications found on
current handheld CE devices.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, there's no way for Web companion users to add other
software, so if they want additional applications, they will have
to depend on programs and services offered free or for rent on the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, you might not be able to take advantage of some of the
multimedia and other advanced features on the Web because the
plug-ins and other special software such sites often require may
not run on such simplified devices. A spokesman for Compaq said,
however, that the most popular audio and video formats would be
supported on his company's companion.
</P>
<P>
   In hardware terms, the companions shown here this week all use
National Semiconductor's Geode GX, a chip that combines an
Intel-compatible core with a variety of additional features _
including graphics, sound and communications capabilities _ that
require extra circuitry on standard PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Integrating such features on the main processor _ an approach
known as ``system on a chip'' _ cuts costs and saves space. The
companions will have no disk drives at all _ floppy, hard or
CD-ROM. Here, too, users who want to preserve the information they
find or create will have to rely on the Web, perhaps saving their
data to one of the growing number of online sites offering free
storage space.
</P>
<P>
   With no drives, the machines will be virtually silent, and they
will be ready to use just seconds after you touch the on button,
without the tedious boot-up process that PCs require.
</P>
<P>
   There's no telling yet whether users will find the companions'
combination of capabilities and trade-offs appealing, but analysts
seem to be taking them seriously. International Data Corp. last
week released a report projecting that 18.5 million information
appliances will ship in the United States U.S.  &LR; alone by 2001 _
more than the 15.7 million home PCs expected to be sold here in the
same year.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies in San
Jose, said he considers Microsoft's key role in the development of
the Web companion a ``landmark shift'' in the software giant's
business model, from one dependent mainly on software sales to one
based on a continuing ``stream'' of service fees and revenues
shared with e-commerce sites where companion users shop.
</P>
<P>
   Bajarin also noted that Microsoft's plan adds up to a ``serious
challenge'' to America Online, which currently  &LR; has more than six
times as many users as Microsoft's MSN service. ``This is taking
the battle between them to a whole new level,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   AOL, of course, is likely to have some new weapons of its own to
wage that battle with. Earlier this year, it invested $800 million
in PC-maker Gateway, which has long had an interest in the
information appliance category, and industry sources say the two
companies are now  &LR; working together to develop equally simple and
inexpensive ``AOL companions.''

 Pearls Add Luster to Risky Abalone Venture 
 &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Abalone farming isn't the quickest way to make a buck. Although the
rock-clinging mollusk is in short supply and its meat fetches $60
or more per pound, the seaweed-munching mollusks grow at a snail's
pace.
<P>
   It takes at least three years of care and feeding to grow a
modest 3-incher in captivity. To fetch a greater return, US Abalone
of Santa Cruz County, also known as US Abs, is muscling into a new
market with its abalone pearls.
</P>
<P>
   The Davenport aquaculture company, which grows abalone in
beachside tanks, has just printed a catalog for its cultured
abalone pearls fashioned by Carmel's Crossroads Jewelers and plans
to sell them from its Web site (www.usabalone.com).
</P>
<P>
   Pearls produced by abalone are not the traditional spherical
variety produced by oysters. Unlike the docile bivalve, abalone
have a powerful foot that is adept at kicking out foreign objects.
</P>
<P>
   That would ordinarily make it hard to culture abalone pearls.
However, US Abs says it has a proprietary way to permanently attach
an inserted bead to the inside of the abalone's shell. The bead is
then covered with layers of lustrous nacre. After 12 to 18 months,
the critter can be harvested both for meat and a ``blister'' or
half-dome ``mabe'' pearl, which might sell for $200 or $300.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could make a living doing meat, but pearls make us
interesting to Wall Street,'' said US Abalone CEO James Webb, who
has started talking to investment bankers about a possible IPO.
</P>
<P>
   Abalone traditionally has been a pricey item on the menu, with
restaurants charging $40 to $80 for a single entree. Webb said it
is popular from sushi bars in Japan to San Francisco restaurants
such as Rubicon, Big Four and Charles-Nob Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Duarte's Tavern in Pescadero charges $22.50 for a sandwich and
$45 for an abalone dinner. ``It's a good seller,'' said owner Ron
Duarte. ``But it's really tedious work to prepare and we'd love to
get bigger ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Three-inch abalone that sell for $4 or $5 each yield only about
an ounce of meat, and the texture and mild flavor are similar to
the much cheaper scallop or calamari steak.
</P>
<P>
   US Abs hopes to turn a profit this quarter, but it has been a
long time coming. Webb, whose background includes stints as a
private investigator, a fishing boat captain and a venture
capitalist for Alan Shugart's Pebble Beach Ventures, got interested
in aquaculture while writing a thesis on the subject for an MBA
degree in Monterey in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shrimp, salmon, catfish and trout are commodities,'' he said.
``I wanted something in short supply and high demand.'' He teamed
up with marine biologist Tom Ebert, whose father, Earl, pioneered
growing abalone in captivity while working for the California
Department of Fish and Game in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   US Abalone raised $5 million from private investors, including
$2 million in a direct Internet stock offering three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   US Abalone started at Pillar Point by Half Moon Bay, growing
abalone in cages suspended from floating rafts. But Webb said the
labor cost to raise and lower the cages to feed and harvest the
abalone was too high. The site also lacked the controlled growing
conditions US Abs now has on 4 acres of beachfront land about 10
miles north of Santa Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   The company bought the facility from SilverKing Oceanic Farms,
another aquaculture company that had a bright idea but hit
financial shoals in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   SilverKing raised smolt, released them to the ocean and then
waited for them to return up the fish ladder to their original home
years later, fat and ready for sale.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem was that commercial fishermen quickly learned
of the annual homecoming and perched offshore to intercept the
incoming salmon. SilverKing mounted a legal challenge but came up
empty again and went out of business.
</P>
<P>
   US Abs leased the site in 1993 and took two years to get permits
to grow Haliotis rufescens, also known as Pacific red abalone,
which can grow to 10 inches or more in the sea.
</P>
<P>
   But coastal abalone is increasingly rare as a result of
overharvesting and a commercial moratorium on abalone hunting.
Voracious sea otters and disease also have taken a toll.
</P>
<P>
   Farm-raised abalone is a pricey and puny alternative.
</P>
<P>
   The process starts with trying to make abalone more amorous. In
the wild, abalone release their eggs and sperm at about the same
time once a year.
</P>
<P>
   For a commercial abalone grower, who wants a continuous supply
of product, that is not a good trait. To prod the gastropods to
procreate on a more-regular basis, their handlers resort to various
tricks like increasing the water temperature, turning on
ultraviolet lights or throwing a splash of hydrogen peroxide into
their water.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the nearly microscopic ``seed'' abalone are put in
separate tanks where they are fed single algae called diatoms.
After consuming this baby food diet for about six months and
growing about half an inch, the young abalone are treated to
seaweed for the first time and consume a whopping 5 percent of
their body weight a day.
</P>
<P>
   US Abs has about 2 million abalone at various stages of
development and hopes to increase sales from 100,000 this year to
500,000 in 2000. Within a few years it hopes to have at least half
its crop producing pearls.
</P>
<P>
   Although this will add a year or more to the growing cycle, it
should be far more profitable than selling only the meat.
</P>
<P>
   There are nearly 20 licensed abalone farms in California but
only about a half-dozen are producing. The biggest is Abalone Farm
near Morro Bay in Luis Obispo County, which sells about 600,000
live and vacuum-packed abalone a year. But it has been profitable
only for 2 two  &LR; of the past 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an extremely labor-intensive and difficult business,''
said Abalone Farm President Ray Fields. ``But farmers are eternal
optimists.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only are abalone slow growing, they can succumb to various
problems. The abalone-eating sabellid worm accidentally imported
from South Africa in the early 1980s has wreaked havoc in some
unprotected farms. Warming seas caused by El Ni &LR; n &LR; o in 1997 and
1998 also killed many abalone. So has fresh water runoff during
winter and spring storms.
</P>
<P>
   At Tomales Bay in Marin County, Abalone Acres and Liquid Earth
Abalone were both washed out of business by storms that reduced the
salinity of the water to the point where most of their abalone
expired.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Mariculture of Santa Cruz is another abalone farm that
also no longer answers the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, entrepreneurs are clamoring to get into the
abalone business. In July, four abalone farms received permission
from the California Coastal Commission to grow more than 2 million
abalone in floating cages off Pillar Point in San Mateo County.

 A BUSINESS _ SF CHRON   Export Market Is Big for Small Businesses 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Q: I have a small business that sells to a number of states but am
interested in exploring exporting overseas. Where do I to start
looking for information?
<P>
   A: You are not alone. More and more small businesses are rushing
into the export market.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Small Business Administration reported last week that
the number of small businesses that sell abroad tripled in the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Small businesses now account for nearly 31 percent of total &LR; 
 &LR; U.S. exports and 97 percent of all firms that export are small
businesses. Emerging markets are especially important to small
business owners.
</P>
<P>
   For example, small exporters are responsible for about 38
percent of all U.S. goods going to China and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   So, where to start? You might try the Small Business
Administration's Office of International Trade Web site
(www.sba.gov/oit). It discusses a range of resources including
trade links for first-time exporters.
</P>
<P>
   There are 19 U.S. Export Assistance Centers, which market the
SBA's loan guarantee programs to small business exporters and
lenders. The closest center is in San Jose, and they will guarantee
as much as 90 percent of a purchase order up to $750,000.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Sachs, director of the export assistance center in Long
Beach, says these centers help ``export-ready clients'' who either
have exported before or have received inquiries from potential
overseas buyers.
</P>
<P>
   For small businesses like yours which are just starting to
explore opportunities, Sachs suggests checking out SBA-sponsored
training conferences or getting counseling through the Service
Corps of Retired Executives and the nationwide network of Small
Business Development Centers.
</P>
<P>
   Also check out the U.S. Department of Commerce's Trade Promotion
Association. Its comprehensive trade database allows you to check
which countries might be most interested in your product and who
your main competitors would be.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Software Deductions
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: What are the rules on deducting the cost of software bought by a
business?
</P>
<P>
   A: As a general rule, software bought for business use must be
depreciated over a 36-month period, according to tax attorney Fred
Daily. But there are three important exceptions:
</P>
<P>
   _Software with a useful life of less than a year _ and given the
rapid change in technology, this could apply to a lot of programs _
can be deducted as a business expense in the year you buy it.
</P>
<P>
   _When software comes with a computer, and its cost is not
separately stated, it is treated as part of the hardware and
depreciated over five years.
</P>
<P>
   _You can write off an entire computer system, including bundled
software, in the first year (under a special provision, IRC Sec.
179) if the total cost is less than $19,000.
</P>
<P>
   Daily, author of ``Tax Savvy for Small Business'' (Nolo Press,
$29.95, &LR; ) &LR;   &LR; ( &LR; www.nolo.com), also offers these six year-end tax
planning tips for small businesses:
</P>
<P>
   1. Establish and contribute to a tax-advantaged retirement plan
such as an IRA, Keogh or 401(k). By contributing before the end of
1999, you not only will get a tax deduction, but see your earnings
in the plan compound tax-deferred. Hint: if you don't have the
money, you might want to borrow it for the tax savings.
</P>
<P>
   2. Buy that new computer or other business equipment before the
end of the year and deduct up to $19,000 without having to take the
usual long-term depreciation deduction. Tip: You can still get this
deduction if you only charge the expense and don't pay for it until
next year!
</P>
<P>
   3. Get your records in order. Accurate records are the key to
getting your tax return done in time and can ward off an IRS audit.
Hint: Use a simple software program like Quicken.
</P>
<P>
   4. Sell or donate obsolete business equipment and out of date
inventory by the end of 1999. This will offset your business income
and reduce your taxes. Tip: If you donate goods, make sure you can
back up the donation with documents showing the value and to whom
the items were given.
</P>
<P>
   5. Prepay state income taxes for 1999. If you pay all of your
state income taxes before the end of December (instead of waiting
until April 15, 2000), you get the full federal tax deduction for
1999. Otherwise, you'll have to wait another year.
</P>
<P>
   6. Buy supplies and other business items you would normally
purchase in the first part of next year, to accelerate the
deduction to 1999. Typically, the earlier you can claim a
tax-deduction, the longer you will have use of the money.

PFIZER INCREASES EFFORT TO WIN WARNER-LAMBERT BID 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pfizer stepped up its effort Tuesday to acquire Warner-Lambert,
beginning its attempt to oust the New Jersey company's board of
directors and outlining the advantages of the hostile takeover to
Wall Street analysts.
</P>
<P>
   William Steere, Pfizer's chairman, also made it clear that he
was not going to be overly patient in his dealings with
Warner-Lambert. Two weeks ago, Warner-Lambert had announced a $72
billion merger with American Home Products, which included a $2
billion breakup fee and a clause that would hinder the use of stock
in a future deal.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer filed an amended complaint in Delaware Chancery court
Tuesday that could hasten the removal of both roadblocks. In the
company's annual meeting with analysts Tuesday, Pfizer executives
said that they expected the court to rule in the company's favor in
four to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Steere expressed even more confidence. Speaking to analysts and
reporters about Pfizer's bid to acquire Warner-Lambert, he noted
that Pfizer ``would persist and prevail,'' and that his company
``was determined to seize this opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer had planned to use the meeting with analysts Tuesday to
ward off concerns that its bounty of drugs under development
trailed that of many of its competitors. Pfizer's executives spent
more than two hours detailing the progress of their existing drugs
_ seven of which have projected annual worldwide sales this year of
$1 billion or more _ before highlighting several compounds under
development.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Pfizer clearly had other motives. The company wasted little
time reminding executives of Pfizer's sizzling historic financial
performance in comparison with many of its competitors. In several
key categories _ including 1999 year-to-date revenue growth _
Pfizer and Warner-Lambert were industry leaders, while American
Home Products was 12th.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for American Home Products said that the company's
pipeline was the strongest in its 73-year history and that as far
as the company was concerned, it was the strongest pipeline in the
entire pharmaceutical industry.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer executives also noted that Warner-Lambert would actually
hurt its own financial performance if it were to merge with
American Home Products. Pfizer said that Warner-Lambert's pro forma
return on equity would drop to 34 percent from 40 percent if that
merger took place.
</P>
<P>
   While Steere and his executives were enthusiastic about their
proposed takeover of Warner-Lambert, the day's presentations
clearly irritated Lodewijk de Vink, Warner-Lambert's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers Pfizer presented today created no long-term stock
value,'' he said. ``Their deal is about now. Our merger with
American Home Products will help us achieve our strategic objective
to create a company based on new product introductions.'' Despite
de Vink's reservations, several analysts said they were favorably
impressed by Pfizer's presentation. The company provided details on
three new drugs, including one for asthma, that some analysts
believed could be strong sellers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am always impressed with Pfizer's presentations,'' said
Viren Mehta, a partner at Mehta Partners. ``Pfizer is clearly
committed to acquiring Warner-Lambert at any cost. They are trying
to establish a position of strength so they will not feel rushed to
change their offer for Warner-Lambert in haste.''
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer has also applied more pressure to its court case. Pfizer
made a point of noting that Warner-Lambert's tactics to avoid a
takeover could harm the combined company if Pfizer's takeover bid
is successful.
</P>
<P>
   One of the issues in the court case is the type of bookkeeping
that Pfizer would use to account for its proposed merger. As part
of its amended court complaint, Pfizer said that if it had to use
purchase accounting to buy Warner-Lambert, the good will from the
transaction could be in excess of $80 billion.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Microsoft `Big Time' Guilty, Silicon Valley Congressman Says  &HT;     By Carolyn Lochhead 
 &HT;     Chronicle Washington Bureau 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Washington _ Tom Campbell is a House Republican who represents
Silicon Valley and also happens to teach antitrust law at Stanford
University.
<P>
   If his views on the Microsoft case carry any credibility, the
Seattle software giant should settle now before it's too late.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said in an interview that media coverage has widely
overlooked the most damning conclusions of Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson's 207-page findings of fact: Microsoft met with its
competitors for the clear purpose of restraining trade.
</P>
<P>
   Such a violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act is so basic and
so clear cut that Microsoft is ``big time'' guilty, Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has gotten no attention to speak of,'' he said, since
even the Justice Department has been riveted on the judge's finding
that Microsoft is a monopolist that abused its power to harm
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   That finding deals with the much grayer Section 2 of the Sherman
Act, Campbell said, and could be questioned and even reversed on
appeal, despite the deference courts give to a trial judge's fact
findings.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge's finding that Microsoft executives met with
competitors _ Netscape, Intel, Apple Computer, IBM and RealNetworks
_ for the purpose of dividing markets and restricting competition
is what lawyers call a ``per se violation'' of Section 1 that
leaves no room for interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge finds that Microsoft did that,'' Campbell said.
Whether the actions harmed consumers or had any effect whatsoever
is irrelevant. Such meetings are simply illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is garden variety,'' Campbell said. ``You must not sit down
with your competitor and agree not to compete. If the antitrust
attorney at Microsoft didn't tell that to the boss, then she or he
ought to have been fired.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a prohibition ``is so basic in law that a company that goes
ahead and does it anyway brings out the most strenuous
enforcement,'' Campbell said. ``I think the Justice Department is
going to go for a very, very tough remedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he added, ``Since this is what Judge Jackson believes
_ he believes that Bill Gates sat down with his competitors and
proposed an agreement not to compete _ I think the judge is going
to be disposed to grant the toughest kind of relief that Justice
asks for.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat whom Campbell is
challenging next November, has not commented extensively on the
case. In a television interview last week, Feinstein said she hoped
for a settlement and questioned whether the 1890 Sherman Act should
apply to the high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is opening up a kind of commerce and a way of
doing business that has been atypical and unknown in the United
States,'' Feinstein said. ``So the law has to catch up.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell agreed that Section 2 of the Sherman Act may be
inappropriate to the high-tech industry, which is characterized by
so-called network effects, in which standardization around core
technologies leads to a winner-take-all pattern of industrial
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Microsoft is the classic example of such a pattern; its
ubiquitous Windows operating system both enables the writing of
software applications that everyone can use, and creates what
Jackson found to be a ``barrier to entry'' by competing operating
systems.
</P>
<P>
   But Section 1 is ``as good today as it was in 1890,'' Campbell
argued. ``There is nothing entrepreneurial about agreeing with a
competitor not to compete. ... If the judge's finding is correct
that the CEO of a very, very important company sat with a
competitor and agreed not to compete, then it was essential that
Justice bring this case, or else we don't have a rule of law in
this line of our economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Letting such actions go unpunished, he argued, would do far more
economic damage than pursuing them. ``If price fixing, market
division, agreements not to compete were permitted, it would be
devasting to the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Campbell's conservatives colleagues sharply disagree,
attacking the government suit as an unwarranted intrusion that will
lead to government regulation of the world's most dynamic market.
</P>
<P>
   As Sen. Slade Gorton, the Washington Republican who is
Microsoft's most vigorous political defender, put it, ``Should the
government take a major step toward destroying America's greatest
success story and regulating the high-tech industry, our global
leadership in the area of high tech will be put at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell agreed that any continuing government regulation of
Microsoft's actions should be avoided, but he said he does not view
a breakup with the loathing that some conservatives do.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want a clean solution that does not involve the
government monitoring business practices _ and on these things I am
conservative, I'm very much against the federal government
regulating how business is done _ a clean way to solve this is a
separation of the operating system from applications,'' Campbell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell also dismissed conservative critics who have begun
arguing that the precedent for Microsoft is not the famously
successful breakup of the AT&AMP;T telephone monopoly, but rather the
government's pursuit of United Shoe Machinery Corp. in 1953 and the
Schwinn bicycle company in 1967, both now widely viewed as
misguided and destructive.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said he teaches both cases as ``pathologies'' of
antitrust case law, because neither company had the market power
that the government alleged. But both cases are ``terribly false
examples'' to apply to Microsoft, he argued. ``AT&AMP;T was a
monopolist, Microsoft is a monopolist, United Shoe was not a
monopolist and Schwinn was not a monopolist,'' he said. ``Both of
those were eventually roundly criticized and are no longer followed
in antitrust.''

 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTIAC, Mich. _ A state jury on Tuesday found a boy guilty of
second-degree murder for a killing he committed when he was 11. He
is believed to be the youngest American ever tried and convicted of
murder as an adult, in a case that has highlighted a national trend
toward putting children on trial as adults.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, all but six states have adopted new juvenile justice
laws that allow more children to be tried as adults, with Michigan
adopting one of the toughest statutes of all in 1996. Civil
liberties and human rights groups have opposed these laws,
contending that treating children as adults will turn them into
hardened criminals.
</P>
<P>
   But many state-level Republican politicians have led campaigns
for adult trials and long prison sentences for juvenile offenders,
using the slogan, ``adult crime, adult time.'' Michigan Gov. John
Engler, a Republican, welcomed Tuesday's verdict, saying that
11-year-olds were mature enough to understand the seriousness of
firing a gun.
</P>
<P>
   The convicted boy, Nathaniel Abraham, was 11 years and 9 months
old when he went out on a hillside here in this northern suburb of
Detroit on the evening of Oct. 29, 1997. He used a borrowed,
.22-caliber rifle to shoot a stranger who was walking out of a
convenience store, killing him with a single bullet in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel could receive a sentence of up to life in prison. But
prosecutors said they would ask that he be incarcerated initially
in a juvenile detention center and reassessed at ages 19 and 21 to
determine whether he had been rehabilitated enough for release or
should be sent to a prison for adults.
</P>
<P>
   The jury acquitted Nathaniel of first-degree murder, which would
have required the prosecution to prove him guilty of planning the
killing. But while the judge in the case, Judge Eugene Moore, gave
the jury the option of finding Nathaniel guilty of involuntary
manslaughter, the jury ended up choosing instead the charge of
second-degree murder, which requires proof that the killing was
intentional.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that he knew the firearm was dangerous,'' said jury
foreman Daniel Stolz. The jury deliberated for four days before
reaching a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel, who was impassive during the trial, appeared shaken
but did not cry when the verdict was read. ``He doesn't understand
it, he literally never has,'' said Geoffrey Fieger, a prominent
lawyer who defended Nathaniel for free. Fieger contended during the
trial that Nathaniel lacked the mental capacity to be held
responsible for his actions. Court-appointed psychologists found
that Nathaniel had below-average intelligence for his age and
limited ability to control anger.
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel's mother wept at the verdict while the victim's mother
said in an interview that she was pleased. ``Justice has been
served,'' said Robin Adams, the mother of the slain man, Ronnie
Greene Jr. ``The child has a lot of anger in him and someone needs
to reach out to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Fieger said his law firm had checked with officials in all 50
states and found that Nathaniel was the first American ever tried
for murder as an adult and convicted for a killing at such a young
age. But Melissa Sickmund, a senior research associate at the
National Center for Juvenile Justice, a non-profit group in
Pittsburgh, was more cautious about declaring Nathaniel the
youngest, citing a paucity of state and federal statistics on very
young offenders. A federal report earlier this autumn on juvenile
justice noted that children as young as seven were tried as adults
during the eighteenth century.
</P>
<P>
   The jury here in Oakland County Circuit Court acquitted
Nathaniel, who now 13 years old, three other charges, including
felony possession of a firearm during the murder. Fieger said he
would file a motion within a week asking Moore to overturn the
guilty verdict on the second-degree murder charge, on the grounds
that Nathaniel should not be found guilty of fatally shooting
someone while acquitted of possessing a gun to fire the shot.
</P>
<P>
   But Patricia Mell, a professor of criminal law at Michigan State
University, questioned whether the motion would be successful.
``Just because verdicts are inconsistent doesn't necessarily mean
that they're overturned,'' she said. Although defendants in
Michigan are sometimes found guilty of firearms possession and
acquitted of a related crime, Professor Mell said that it was very
unusual for the reverse to occur.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary hearing on the sentencing was scheduled for Dec.
14. But Lisa Halushka, the assistant Oakland County prosecutor who
handled the case, said that it was likely to be postponed because
various trial records needed to be prepared and Nathaniel might
need to be interviewed again by a court-appointed psychologist.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Fieger said he believed that race had played a role in the
prosecution and conviction of Nathaniel, who is black. He said
Nathaniel would never have been charged with murder in neighboring
Wayne County, which encompasses Detroit and is heavily black.
Oakland County is only 8 percent black, and was mainly settled in
the 1960s and 1970s by whites fleeing Detroit. There was only one
black, an elderly man, on Nathaniel's jury; the jury had seven
women and five men.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Halushka strongly denied that race had played any role.
</P>
<P>
   Fieger indirectly acknowledged during the trial that Nathaniel
had fired the shot that killed Greene, who was 18 at the time of
his death, and who was black. Fieger said Nathaniel had been
shooting at trees, and that Greene's death had been a tragic
accident.
</P>
<P>
   But the prosecution said that Nathaniel told classmates before
the killing that he planned to shoot someone. He engaged in target
practice, shot his victim, went home and watched television and
bragged about the incident the next day to a classmate, the
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, Fieger contended that Nathaniel was 288 feet
from Greene at the time of the shooting, and could not have hit him
deliberately at such a distance with the rifle, which was 30 years
old and missing its stock. Defense witnesses also suggested that
the bullet entered Greene's head so far above the hairline that the
bullet must have ricocheted off a tree branch overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Halushka offered a very different account during the trial.
She said that Nathaniel was only 200 feet from Greene, and that
Nathaniel had used balloons for target practice during the days
before Greene's death. Prosecution witnesses also contended that
Greene's bullet wound was consistent with his having tilted his
head at the moment of impact, and did not indicate that the bullet
had struck him from above. Nathaniel was firing from a steep
hillside overlooking the convenience store.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Michigan is one of the leaders in a move by Republicans to allow
ever younger children to be tried as adults with a judge's
permission and for an ever lengthening list of crimes. A
three-year-old state law allows prosecutors to ask judges for
permission to try any youth as an adult, no matter how young. Until
the law was passed, children had to be at least 14 to be tried as
an adult with a judge's permission. Other states have also been
lowering this age to as young as 10.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan has long mandated that anyone 17 or older be tried
automatically as an adult, unlike many other states and the federal
government, which require that a defendant be at least 18 to be
automatically considered an adult. While Michigan once had a
reputation for liberalism, the state's increasingly conservative
Republican Party now controls the state's House and Senate, as well
as the governor's mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Halushka said that Tuesday's verdict would make sure that
Nathaniel would receive treatment and not pose a risk to society.
But Fieger predicted that Oakland County would be ridiculed for
Tuesday's decision, adding, ``The rest of the world will rightfully
scorn this and hold us in contempt.''
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International U.S.A., the American arm of the global
human rights group, condemned Tuesday's verdict. ``As America
exhorts other nations to uphold basic human rights principles, we
should begin with the ABC's of human rights and treat our own young
offenders as children _ not as adults,'' said Curt Goering, the
American group's senior deputy executive director.

DEFENDANT TESTIFIES, BLAMES OTHERS FOR DRAGGING DEATH 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATTY REINERT 
and RICHARD STEWART 
c.1999, Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ Shawn Berry never took Bill King's threats to
harm a black man seriously because the white supremacist had a
reputation for talking big and then walking away, Berry told jurors
Tuesday in his capital murder trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just Bill,'' he said. ``Ask anyone who knows Bill if
he'd ever back up anything he said, and they'll tell you no.''
</P>
<P>
   But Berry also testified that when King threatened him, he was
so petrified that he gave up his attempts to intervene, stepped
aside and watched as his two co-defendants beat James Byrd Jr.,
chained his ankles to a pickup and dragged him more than three
miles through the East Texas woods last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't do anything more to stop them. I couldn't move,''
Berry said. ``I didn't say anything. I didn't do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry, 24, spent more than four hours on the witness stand,
blaming his co-defendants for the gruesome killing on June 7, 1998.
King, 25, and Russell Brewer Jr., 32, were tried separately earlier
this year and were sent to death row.
</P>
<P>
   Berry's case is expected to go to an all-white jury today after
closing arguments. If convicted, Berry will return to the courtroom
for the trial's punishment phase, which could result in a life
prison sentence or death by injection.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, prosecutors showed the jury seven statements, some of
them conflicting, that Berry gave police shortly after his arrest,
and they played excerpts from a jailhouse interview by CBS anchor
Dan Rather that was broadcast on 60 Minutes II in September.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Berry tried to explain his changing stories to the
jury as his lawyer, Joseph C. ``Lum'' Hawthorn, read each sentence
of his statements and asked Berry whether they were true or false.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had nothing to do with it whatsoever,'' Berry said in his
first statement, which he contends is still true.
</P>
<P>
   Berry said he lied when he told investigators that King was
driving as the three men headed into the woods east of Jasper with
Byrd in the bed of Berry's pickup. He lied again, he said, when he
told police he had run away once he realized King and Brewer
intended to attack Byrd, 49.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not want to say that I drove out to that road,'' Berry
said. ``I didn't want to say that I was anywhere near Mr. Byrd.''
</P>
<P>
   After the men left Byrd's mangled, decapitated corpse outside
the gates of a black cemetery and headed back to their apartment,
Berry said King and Brewer convinced him that he was just as guilty
as they were for being present at the crime scene, and he said he
feared retaliation from the two racists if he turned them in to
police.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill said if I were to turn them in, no matter what prison
unit I ended up in, they'd find me,'' he said. ``I believe anybody
in their right mind would be worried about them.''
</P>
<P>
   But on cross-examination, Jasper County District Attorney Guy
James Gray suggested that Berry was lying for a more obvious reason
_ to save his own skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't want to admit the degree of your involvement,''
said Gray, who contends Berry was a full participant in the killing
and that he drove the truck not just to the crime scene but also as
Byrd was being dragged.
</P>
<P>
   And Gray reminded Berry of his previous testimony that King had
a habit of making threats he never carried out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time Bill King ever said anything, he was never near the
person,'' Berry explained. ``This time, he was acting on what he
said. And he had Russell Brewer with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray also pointed out that instead of calling his uncle, a
highway patrolman, for help, Berry spent the day after the killing
getting rid of the evidence. He and King went to a local carwash to
clean Berry's truck and to wash off a 24-foot logging chain used to
drag Byrd.
</P>
<P>
   Berry later led police to the chain, which he said had been
stashed by King and Brewer in the woods outside a friend's trailer
house.
</P>
<P>
   Gray pointed out that Berry had used the word ``we'' 45 times in
his written statements to police, but by the time he appeared on
national television, he had rehearsed his story and had begun to
use the word ``they.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he gave a performance equal to the 60 Minutes
performance,'' Gray said outside the courthouse later. ``He is a
pretty good witness. He's a nice looking boy. (But) I don't believe
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The premise that he didn't know what his companions were like
and he was going out there just merely to drink beer and nothing
else, that's not true,'' Gray continued, ``and I don't think anyone
can believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorn said Berry's testimony was very believable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he did great,'' he said. ``I'm very, very happy with
the way he did and I've heard a lot of people say the same thing. I
think he was very credible.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorn rested the defense case Tuesday by showing jurors a
color photo of Berry and his young son, Montana, on an overhead
projector.
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge Joe Bob Golden is expected to decide this
morning whether to allow prosecutors to show the jury photos of
King's and Brewer's racist tattoos, which they got while members of
the Confederate Knights of America, a small racist prison gang.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say the tattoos would help jurors decide whether it
would have been obvious to Berry that he was placing Byrd in danger
by offering him a ride in the middle of the night while he was with
two Klansmen.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Berry's brother, Louis, read a statement on KJAS, a
local radio station, expressing sympathy for the Byrd family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm deeply sorry about what has happened,'' Louis Berry said.
``I wish there was something I could do to stop the hurt and pain
for all the families involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Louis Berry said his family wanted to reach out to the Byrd
family but didn't know what to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only wish I could have been with my brother on that night,''
he said. ``I sincerely believe I could have helped him prevent what
happened. I believe he was simply by himself and outnumbered by
people who had already made up their mind.'' &QL;

IT'S TIME TO CLEAR THE WAY FOR KOBE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Kobe Bryant is nearly ready to play again, and his
imminent return from the injured list will force changes to both
the starting lineup and the 12-man roster.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant will be reevaluated this morning by team orthopedist Dr.
Stephen Lombardo. He already has resumed shooting, dribbling and
light-contact drills and has proclaimed himself recovered from the
broken right hand he suffered Oct. 13.
</P>
<P>
   When he returns, the Los Angeles Lakers will once again be
overloaded with guards and small forwards.
</P>
<P>
   They waived Sam Jacobson last week to make room for forward
Robert Horry but are still carrying just five big men to go with
seven guards and small forwards.
</P>
<P>
   That means a guard will be removed to make room for Bryant, and
the likely choice is to send rookie John Celestand back to injured
reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get big guys,'' coach Phil Jackson said. ``We
need big bodies on this team. We've got a lot of small forwards and
guards _ I don't like to have over seven on the roster, players who
can bring the ball, handle the ball. And then you've got to have
your five big guys who can take the abuse and the pounding and
cover the lane, rebounding.''
</P>
<P>
   Celestand was activated Monday when Tyronn Lue went to the
injured list because of a sore right knee.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's eventual return to the starting lineup will force
either Ron Harper or Derek Fisher to the bench. Jackson likes to
play big-guard tandems, which would seem to favor Harper, but
Jackson said he hasn't made that decision yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be Harper that goes to the bench. (Bryant) may be
teamed with Derek. We'll see how that goes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Fisher remains a starter, Jackson looks forward to
playing long stretches when the 6-foot-7 Bryant is teamed in the
backcourt with either the 6-6 Harper, 6-6 Brian Shaw or 6-7 Rick
Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have anticipated playing big guards together,'' he said.
``When (Bryant) comes back, that's going to be part of the
package.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballot time: Fan voting for the NBA All-Star teams opened
Tuesday, with four Lakers on the Western Conference ballot: Bryant,
Shaquille O'Neal, Glen Rice and Robert Horry.
</P>
<P>
   Ballots are available at NBA arenas, movie theaters and online
at www.NBA.com.
</P>
<P>
   The All-Star Game will be played Feb. 13 at the Oakland Coliseum
Arena.

THE BIG SURPRISE IN KRON-TV SALE WAS THE BUYER 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Young Broadcasting Inc. will be heavily in debt,
bereft of any history in San Francisco and probably not on the best
of terms with NBC after stunning the TV industry this week by
buying NBC affiliate KRON.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, things look peachy for the station and its
future owner.
</P>
<P>
   Young Broadcasting emerged as the winner in the sweepstakes to
buy KRON as part of Chronicle Publishing Co.'s fabulous
going-out-of-business sale, which has included the pending purchase
of the San Francisco Chronicle by Hearst Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Young's purchase includes a 51 percent stake in BayTV, the local
cable news and information channel.
</P>
<P>
   That the sale figure is $823 million, the most ever for a TV
station, is the lighter part of the general astonishment. The
bigger surprise was Young _ a station group in which, only three
years ago, WBAY-TV in Green Bay, Wis., looked like an awesomely
muscled giant.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom was that NBC would buy its biggest
affiliate. And if not NBC, then maybe Rupert Murdoch and his Fox
station group.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are kind of scratching their heads,'' Don Fitzpatrick,
a San Francisco TV consultant, said of the news that Young will buy
KRON.
</P>
<P>
   With stations in Rockford, Ill., Lansing, Mich., Sioux Falls,
S.D., and similar centers of American urbanity, Young had the
industry visibility of a burrowed mole until it purchased KCAL-TV
in Los Angeles in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   It bought the unaffiliated KCAL from the Walt Disney Co. and
immediately embarked on an ambitious program of station
improvements. To wit, it pink-slipped employees in droves. The KCAL
massacre, reasonably enough, is now raising anxieties at KRON.
</P>
<P>
   Deb McDermott, executive vice president of Young Broadcasting,
said by telephone Tuesday that it's too soon to assess the
situation at KRON. But comparisons with KCAL would be erroneous,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott said Disney had fattened KCAL to the extent that it
was grossly overstaffed. She said that isn't the case at KRON.
</P>
<P>
   ``KCAL and KRON are two very different television stations,''
McDermott said. ``KRON is absolutely a jewel. ... It's a very
well-run, efficient television station.''
</P>
<P>
   McDermott said it's ``premature'' to say whether existing KRON
managers will be asked to stay. She added that the call letters
will remain KRON, a holdover from the soon-to-end Chronicle era.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott said all the right things about her company's
commitment to local TV news. But a quick survey of journalists in
cities where Young owns stations indicated a spectrum of good and
bad news operations.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzpatrick, who is particularly knowledgeable about TV news,
described the Young Broadcasting shops as ``kind of nondescript.''
</P>
<P>
   A newspaper reporter in one of Young's bigger cities said the
company runs tight news operations and invests relatively little in
physical plants.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Scheduled to visit KRON Wednesday, besides McDermott, were
Vincent Young, chairman and chief executive officer of Young
Broadcasting; Jim Morgan, the company's chief financial officer;
and Ron Kwasnick, president of the Young station group.
</P>
<P>
   San Franciscans may wince to know that among these future
Channel 4 overlords, Young and Morgan are based in New York,
Kwasnick in Lansing, Mich., and McDermott in Nashville, Tenn.
Besides KRON and KCAL, the group's biggest station is WKRN-TV in
Nashville. KRN for corn, I guess.
</P>
<P>
   One local TV veteran, who asked not to be identified, noted
Young's debt load and said he anticipates layoffs and other
cutbacks at KRON.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just not the type of people who are going to fund some
of the things a family-operated station would do,'' the source
said. ``That's just not the way life is.''
</P>
<P>
   The same source also said Young is buying a ripe plum _ the NBC
affiliate in the nation's fifth-largest, and highly lucrative, TV
market. ``There's an expression that you can't get out of the way
of the money in San Francisco,'' the source said. ``I mean business
is very, very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year, the source said, California television stations will
rake in a pile of revenue from political advertising. And, as an
NBC affiliate, KRON will benefit from the network's carrying the
Summer Olympics from Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The KRON-NBC affiliation contract extends through 2001, and KRON
executives have said that it's virtually unbreakable, even with the
sale.
</P>
<P>
   NBC had shocked many industry observers, and perhaps alienated
KRON's owners, by its use of bully-boy tactics to carve out the
station for itself. The tactics included threats to end network
compensation to KRON and to clamp down _ apparently illegally _ on
allowing the station to pre-empt network programming.
</P>
<P>
   NBC reportedly also made a pre-emptive $700 million offer for
KRON and demanded a 30-day exclusive negotiating period.
</P>
<P>
   That offer was rejected and, according to one well-connected
source, NBC wasn't among the final bidders for the station.
</P>
<P>
   But it might be too early to rule out NBC as a future owner of
KRON.
</P>
<P>
   Several sources characterized Young Broadcasting as a
medium-size station group, precisely the type of media company
that's prey for a buyout by a larger company.
</P>
<P>
   The most exotic scuttlebutt Tuesday involved NBC's buying Young
Broadcasting at some future time. That would give the network not
only KRON but also a second outlet in Los Angeles, now permitted
under Federal Communications Commission rules.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome, San Francisco is about to enter a new
media environment in which none of its major TV stations, except
public station KQED, is locally owned.
</P>
<P>
   Funny that with all the fuss about newspaper consolidation, no
one in the Bay Area has paid serious attention to the loss of a
locally operated television station. From banks to department
stores to TV stations, and even to newspapers, San Francisco is
becoming a branch office.

HEALTH PROBLEMS SLOW UCLA'S RUSH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA sophomore forward JaRon Rush did not have an
enjoyable freshman year. He was hurt. He was homesick. He was
disciplined for missing practice. His shooting touch never arrived,
and the Bruins lost in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Rush spent the summer at home in Kansas City, then returned to
campus hoping for a healthy and happy sophomore season.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it's been more of the same.
</P>
<P>
   He got sick the first day of practice, lost 10 pounds and missed
a week. Chronic back pain ruined a few more days. He strained his
right elbow during a dunk contest at Preview Day, and last week, he
missed a team meal.
</P>
<P>
   Rush is finally healthy enough to practice, but he can't. He's
in Kansas City on personal business and is questionable for
Thursday's exhibition game. (His absence was approved by coach
Steve Lavin, and Rush is in good standing with the team.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's cool with coach Lavin, we're talking and
communicating,'' Rush said last week. ``I just need to get healthy
and practice. When I'm out there, it clicks. I worked on my
shooting and ballhandling, and with the experience of last year,
I'm more confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Rush, 6-foot-7, has not regained all the weight and strength he
lost while sick, his back is a constant problem, and his elbow has
not healed. But because of his energy level, he needs just two or
three practices to regain rhythm and timing _ meaning he should be
ready for next week's season opener against Fairfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``JaRon has picked up the new offense better than I would have
expected considering he's been out,'' Lavin said. ``He's been
banged up, and he's missed practice time, but considering what he's
missed, he's performed well.''
</P>
<P>
   Next up: The Bruins play their final exhibition Thursday at 7:30
p.m. in Pauley Pavilion against the California Midwest All-Stars,
who feature former Cal State Northridge guard Brooklyn McLinn. The
All-Stars are 2-10 on their tour, defeating Washington 94-87 but
losing to USC 102-90.
</P>
<P>
   The team's fluctuating roster could include former UCLA players
Charles O'Bannon, Pooh Richardson and Mitchell Butler, who have
been cut by NBA teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like a tight game,'' Bruins guard Earl Watson said. ``I'd
rather play against Charles, Mitchell and Pooh.''
</P>
<P>
   Young update: Sophomore guard Ray Young won't play Thursday or
next week because of an injured ligament in his right (shooting)
thumb suffered 10 days ago. The Bruins initially feared the
ligament was completely torn, but it now appears to be partially
torn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surgery's still a possibility, but we're very encouraged,''
Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   Who's in, who's out: The Bruins should be in better shape
Thursday than they were last week, when six players were available
to play a Lithuanian club team.
</P>
<P>
   Center Dan Gadzuric might play despite tendinitis in his right
knee and a hyperextended left knee.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Jerome Moiso also has tendinitis but is expected to
play.
</P>
<P>
   Rush will play if he's back from Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Ryan Bailey probably won't play because of tendinitis in
his right foot. He has missed several weeks and is questionable for
Fairfield.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Matt Barnes is academically ineligible during the fall
quarter.

CONGRESS AND TREASURY AGREE ON MINOR TAX BREAKS
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Md., Del., Va., Wis., Puerto Rico, New England, Midwest)  (nk) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The caboose on the legislative train this year is
likely to be a conglomeration of minor tax breaks that, among many
other items, would turn chicken droppings into a tax shelter, give
Puerto Rico a rebate for the tax paid on its rum and extend a pilot
program of school construction bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation's prospects are complicated by a regional
dispute over milk prices between lawmakers from the Northeast and
those from the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations between congressional tax writers and the Treasury
Department were completed Tuesday night. The chicken waste, rum and
school construction measures will be added to a must-pass bill to
extend popular tax breaks that have expired.
</P>
<P>
   The bill could be part of the final omnibus budget package or it
could be considered as separate legislation after the budget bill
is completed.
</P>
<P>
   The tax breaks that expired in September with the end of the
fiscal year and that would be extended include these:
</P>
<P>
   _ A tax credit to help offset business expenses for research and
experimentation.
</P>
<P>
   _ Authority for affluent parents who must pay the alternative
minimum tax to retain the $500 per child tax cut available to other
parents.
</P>
<P>
   _ A temporary tax cut for businesses that hire workers off
welfare rolls.
</P>
<P>
   _ Authority for some American companies with foreign investments
to delay paying taxes on the proceeds until the money is returned
to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than make these popular tax breaks permanent law like
most other parts of the income tax code, lawmakers arrange for them
to expire periodically. That forces the beneficiaries, many of whom
have deep pockets and make political donations, to beseech Congress
regularly to extend them. And it allows the senators and
representatives to claim a measure of credit when they are
reapproved.
</P>
<P>
   The new tax credit for companies that convert the waste from
chicken coops into electricity also has a political dimension. It
was added to the bill at the insistence of Sen. William V. Roth
Jr., R-Del., who is chairman of the Finance Committee and is
involved in a tough race for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   The tax break has long been a dream on the Delmarva Peninsula _
Delaware and the eastern shore of Maryland and Virginia _ where
chicken farming is the largest agricultural enterprise and where
producers like Perdue Farms and Tyson Foods have big plants and
hire thousands of workers.
</P>
<P>
   Chicken droppings are now used for fertilizer, but all three
states have new laws that will eventually ban this because of the
water pollution it causes.
</P>
<P>
   So farmers and business have been searching for new ways to use
the 800 tons of this waste produced on the peninsula every year.
Burning it for electricity is a possibility, but it is probably not
practical economically without a tax advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The rum provision has been pushed by the New York congressional
delegation, particularly Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Rep.
Charles B. Rangel, both Democrats who have many constituents from
Puerto Rico. The measure would return to Puerto Rico and the U.S.
Virgin Islands the $13.50 in excise taxes collected on each gallon
of rum imported into the United States. Only $10.50 per gallon is
now returned. If all of the excise taxes were returned, Puerto Rico
and the U.S. Virgin Islands would get $44 million over five years.
</P>
<P>
   The school construction bonds were first approved as a pilot
program for two years in 1997. This was a part of President
Clinton's education agenda, and he has persuaded Congress to extend
the program for another two years.
</P>
<P>
   The dairy dispute is not likely to derail the tax measure, but
it could make the passage more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers from the Northeast want to prevent the Agriculture
Department from putting a new milk-price system into effect. They
also want to renew a price-fixing mechanism called the Northeast
Dairy Compact, which puts a floor on the price of fresh milk in the
six New England states and which expired with the end of the last
fiscal year. They have persuaded congressional leaders to insert
provisions to accomplish their goals into the final omnibus budget
package or into the tax bill if it is considered separately.
</P>
<P>
   But Midwestern lawmakers say their dairy farmers would be
damaged by this measure. Led by Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., several
Midwestern senators have vowed to filibuster any bill that includes
the dairy legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The Midwesterners apparently do not have the votes to sustain a
filibuster indefinitely. But they could tie up the Senate for days,
and they hope to win concessions from lawmakers who are eager to
adjourn.

FRANK MACSHANE, BIOGRAPHER OF POPULAR NOVELISTS, DIES AT 72  
</HEADLINE>
  (mcd) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frank MacShane, a literary biographer who specialized in
applying the highest standards of criticism to popular novelists
like Raymond Chandler and John O'Hara who had been ignored by other
academic critics, died on Monday at a nursing home in Gloucester,
Mass. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   MacShane, a former professor of writing at Columbia University,
moved to Massachusetts seven years ago after the onset of
Alzheimer's disease, said his son, Nicholas.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as the 1960s and 70s, despite occasional efforts by
Edmund Wilson, W.H. Auden and others, academic literary critics
largely dismissed Chandler as a mere mystery writer, O'Hara as an
undisciplined hack and Ford Madox Ford as a purveyor of glossy
junk, none of them worth the time of serious students of
literature.
</P>
<P>
   MacShane's biography ``The Life of Raymond Chandler'' (1976), in
which he identified Chandler as one of the originators of the
hard-boiled detective story and compared him to Joyce, Tolstoy,
Chaucer, Twain and Conrad, helped change all that.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing the book on the front page of The New York Times Book
Review, Leonard Michaels said that Chandler ``emerges from the book
as a very powerful and psychologically interesting figure.''
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek called the book ``an exemplary biography,'' and Richard
R. Lingeman, in a review in The New York Times, said it was
``valuable and fascinating.'' John Simon, on the other hand, wrote
in Book Week that the biography lacked ``critical acuity.''
</P>
<P>
   The case that MacShane made for Chandler is that he was not just
a mystery writer but a major literary stylist, a novelist and a
keen observer of American life.
</P>
<P>
   The Chandler biography was followed by studies of O'Hara and
James Jones. Previously, MacShane had written a biography of Ford
Madox Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing his career in 1981, MacShane told an interviewer for
Columbia Library Columns that he had concentrated on the study of
writers who had ``substantial followings and many enthusiastic
champions'' but who were not ``automatically accepted into the
highest literary rank.''
</P>
<P>
   MacShane was also a dedicated teacher who focused his attention
on nonfiction and translation. He taught at the Hotchkiss School,
Vassar College, the University of California at Berkeley and
Williams College before founding the graduate writing division in
the School of the Arts at Columbia in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, he founded the translation center as part of the
writing division; the center produced an academic journal called
Translation Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   From 1972 to 1973, MacShane served as dean of the School of the
Arts at Columbia, but then he returned to teaching in the writing
division.
</P>
<P>
   He was born on Oct. 19, 1927, in Pittsburgh, the only son of a
newspaperman who became publisher of The New York Journal-American,
the Hearst flagship.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from Harvard in 1949, and received a master's
degree from Yale in 1951 and a doctorate from Oxford in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son, Nicholas, of Wellesley, Mass., MacShane
is survived by a sister, Jean Fraser-Harris of Bristol, England,
and two grandchildren.  &QL;

GORE REACHES OUT TO ENVIRONMENTALISTS WITH NEW TRADE INITIATIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: SUBS 4th graf with 2 new grafs bgng, In fact ..., to clarify
how order would apply to other countries, add examples from Gore;
pickup 5th graf pvs, Even so ...; also drops Seligman's remark to

 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Seeking to win the active support of environmental
groups that have so far failed to muster much enthusiasm for his
presidential campaign, Vice President Al Gore announced Tuesday
that President Clinton would sign an executive order requiring that
environmental reviews be part of all new trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``America can and should use its trade policy to strengthen
environmental protection both at home and abroad,'' Gore said in
front of cameras at the airport here before returning to
Washington, D.C. ``This is really a significant, watershed event
for the relationship between trade and the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The order will require the U.S. trade representative to conduct
full environmental reviews early in all major negotiations, Gore
said, ``so that we can use that information to shape emerging trade
agreements and to better protect our own environment and the global
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the executive order is not binding on America's trading
partners, but it encourages other nations to take the environment
into account as they develop their economies.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he wanted to end subsidies that promote over-fishing
and eliminate trade barriers that prevent the United States from
exporting cutting-edge technologies that could help other countries
clean up their air and water.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the order begins to put environmental concerns on a par
with business concerns in international agreements, a step that
environmental groups hailed Tuesday as significant, if only a start
in the enduring struggle between businesses and environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   It comes at a crucial time, as the world's trade ministers
prepare to meet in Seattle at the end of the month to discuss
international trade rules, and it sends a signal that the United
States considers environmental standards important.
</P>
<P>
   It also comes at a crucial time for Gore in his bid for the
Democratic nomination. He has failed to stir the passions of the
environmental community on his behalf. The administration's
decision to let Gore make Tuesday's announcement was a reflection
both of his need to make some headway with this important
constituency and also of his push to make the administration more
sensitive to environmental concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Annie Petsonk, international counsel for the Environmental
Defense Fund, welcomed the action as a good first step in bringing
the environmental impact of trade agreements before the public.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's announcement Tuesday followed an hour-long closed-door
session with about a dozen environmental leaders here Monday night.
They have expressed concerns about the administration's commitment
to an array of environmental issues, from protection of salmon in
the Pacific Northwest to the permanent placement of a tug boat in
waters here to try to steer oil barges clear of hazards that could
result in spills.
</P>
<P>
   Participants in the meeting described Gore's posture as
unusually pleading. He told his listeners that he and Clinton could
not have won in 1992 without their support and that while they may
have been disappointed with some administration actions, he needed
their active involvement now.
</P>
<P>
   He also told them that environmental reviews would be a central
topic at the World Trade Organization talks here later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Seligman, director of the Sierra Club's trade program,
said the spirit of Gore's remarks was encouraging. ``We're not
trying to inject environmental standards into WTO; we want to
prevent WTO from weakening the standards we already have,'' he
said.

BUSINESS TRAVEL: DELTA TERMINAL AT LAGUARDIA; EVER BIGGER SHIPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some of the improvements have been in place almost a week, but
Thursday the Delta Shuttle will formally open its newly renovated
Marine Air Terminal at New York's La Guardia Airport _ a terminal
used almost exclusively by business travelers flying between New
York and Boston and Washington. The U S Airways Shuttle departs
from that airline's main terminal at La Guardia.)
</P>
<P>
   Among the improvements resulting from Delta's year-long, $7.5
million overhaul are an upgraded business center with free fax and
photocopy services, and several computer stations. A new Bloomberg
News station in the waiting area has two computers and a larger
screen with a continuous display of financial results and stock
prices.
</P>
<P>
   In the gate area, automated ticketing kiosks with touch-screen
technology allow passengers to receive their boarding pass in less
than a minute. The re-designed passenger waiting area now has more
electrical outlets and telephones with data ports for computers.
Baggage carts with cover flaps _ and weather screens on the outside
baggage conveyor belt _ will provide better protection for checked
luggage.
</P>
<P>
   Promising ``many enhancements'' in the near future, William
Crumbley, the managing director of the Delta Shuttle, said that the
overwhelming majority of its passengers traveled to or from New
York. Since its acquisition from Pan Am in 1991, the Delta Shuttle
has carried more than 15 million passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Ever-Bigger Ships
</P>
<P>
   Bigness may not be everything, as the economist E.F. Schumacher
argued in his 1973 book, ``Small Is Beautiful,'' but you couldn't
prove that from the cruise industry's ever-bigger ships. On Nov. 8,
Carnival's Cunard Lines announced that it had completed plans for
what will be the longest passenger ship ever built (1,100 feet), to
be introduced in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, on Nov. 10, the Port of Miami-Dade officially
opened what it described as the world's biggest cruise passenger
terminal (250,000 square feet). And a day after that, this season's
biggest cruise ship, Royal Caribbean's 142,000 ton Voyager of the
Seas, capable of carrying 3,100 passengers, arrived in Miami in
preparation for its year-round seven-night cruises to the western
Caribbean beginning Nov. 21.
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, a number of cruise lines with small ships
sailing interesting itineraries. But the reason for the huge ships
is that they are intended not just to take passengers on a cruise
but on a floating vacation, the better to compete with land-based
resorts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pan Am Expands Service
</P>
<P>
   Pan American Airways current incarnation is only a shadow of its
former self, but today it is scheduled to begin round-trip service
six days a week between its headquarters in Portsmouth, N.H. and
Gary/Chicago Airport in northern Indiana, and similar service
between Gary/Chicago and Sanford/Orlando Airport in central
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Acquired following bankruptcy proceedings in June 1998 by four
New England investors, Pan Am operated as a charter airline until
October, when it began Portsmouth-Orlando flights six days a week.
</P>
<P>
   More Leg Room on Delta
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Dec. 2, Delta Air Lines will begin flying the Boeing
767-300ER aircraft between New York's Kennedy International Airport
and Phoenix's Sky Harbor Airport. Delta said its business-class
seats had more than double the space of first-class seats of other
carriers flying nonstop between New York and Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   LanChile-Alaska Air Accord
</P>
<P>
   LanChile said Tuesday that it had entered into a code-sharing
agreement with Alaska Airlines. Passengers on both airlines are
eligible to participate in each other's frequent-flier programs.
Also, through Jan. 31, 2000, LanChile frequent-flier members can
earn 1,865 miles when they stay at participating Hyatt Hotels and
Resorts in Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, San
Francisco, Buenos Aires and Santiago, Chile. After January, each
stay at a Hyatt will earn 385 miles. And when LanChile joins the
One World alliance, tentatively scheduled for next March, its
frequent-flier miles can be redeemed toward flights on other
alliance airlines, including American Airlines, British Airways,
Qantas Airways and Air Canada.

HEAD OF BRADLEY'S AD TEAM UNDER FIRE FOR JOE CAMEL WORK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Exclusive)  (Eds: SUBS 3rd graf to clarify who Horrigan worked for.) 
 (nk) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE and JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bill Bradley unveiled his first round of television
commercials in his presidential campaign Tuesday, but he came under
immediate attack from Vice President Al Gore's advisers for relying
on an advertising executive who once worked with the tobacco
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Kroll, the head of Bradley's advertising team, had
extensive contacts with tobacco industry executives when he was
chief executive officer of Young &AMP; Rubicam, one of the world's
largest advertising agencies. During Kroll's tenure, Young &AMP;
Rubicam handled the account that was responsible for the Joe Camel
commercials that marketed cigarettes to young adults.
</P>
<P>
   While there are many documents linking Kroll to the tobacco
industry, the degree of his relationship is not clear. In a letter
to Kroll in 1987, E.A. Horrigan Jr., then the vice chairman of RJR
Nabisco Holdings, the parent company of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco at
the time, thanked Kroll ``for agreeing to take time out of your
busy schedule to meet with me to discuss the unprecedented assault
on tobacco advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   And an internal RJR memorandum in 1991 showed that executives of
the tobacco company viewed Kroll as an official to turn to to
defend the Joe Camel account. The memorandum specifically suggested
that Kroll be given talking points to respond to criticism of the
campaign, which used cartoon renderings of a camel to pitch the
Camel brand.
</P>
<P>
   Kroll said in a telephone interview that he had had meetings
with tobacco executives, but insisted that he had no direct
involvement in the Joe Camel advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have had tobacco accounts since the beginning of
advertising,' ' Kroll said. ``It's highly irrelevant that I was
CEO. And that that in some way relates to the Bradley campaign is
preposterous. I was CEO of a company with 5,000 clients _ one of
which was R.J. Reynolds.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Did I have some meetings with these clients to
solicit their business? I'm sure I met with them at some time or
another. But this is eye opening to me that it's relevant. I wasn't
the creative director of the account. I wasn't the leader of the
account.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Gore campaign officials said they may pounce on Kroll's
links to the tobacco industry. In particularly one campaign
official, who spoke on the condition that his name not be used,
said it was hypocritical for Bradley to campaign on a promise of
protecting young people, particularly the poor, while working with
``a guy who was responsible for trying to sell tobacco products
right to inner city kids.''
</P>
<P>
   By criticizing the Bradley campaign, Gore officials might also
neutralize their own connections with tobacco. One of Gore's top
media consultants, Carter Eskew, has been widely denounced by
health organizations for helping the Philip Morris Cos. develop
television advertisements that sought to undercut support for a
planned federal lawsuit against the tobacco industry. He also
helped create a $40 million advertising blitz last year by the
cigarette industry that has been credited with helping defeat
federal anti-tobacco legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Anita Dunn, Bradley's communications director, said Eskew's
involvement with the tobacco industry was far more serious than
Kroll's.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is really very little comparison to be made between
someone who years ago headed an advertising agency that happened to
have a client, and having as one of your top paid advisers someone
you hired while he was still working for the tobacco industry
having killed what the vice president called one of his top
legislative priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   The Joe Camel campaign, which was discontinued in 1997, was
highly successful for R.J. Reynolds. But it also was highly
controversial. Reynolds had said the campaign was intended to
appeal to younger adult smokers. But anti-smoking groups said the
cartoon appearance was designed to appeal to children.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Kroll was head of Young &AMP; Rubicam when it took over the Camel
account in 1989. About two years later, the agency lost the
account, with an estimated $30 million in annual advertising
spending, to an agency started by two former employees. Kroll
retired from Young &AMP; Rubicam in late 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Kroll became friends with Bradley when they worked together in
1996 on the Advertising Council, the nonprofit organization that
produces public-service announcements. He is an unpaid adviser to
Bradley, and has played a central role in recruiting other
advertising executives to help Bradley shape his message.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the Bradley campaign unveiled its first two
commercials, which feature the closing refrain: ``It can happen.''
The two spots will begin airing in New Hampshire on Wednesday and
in Iowa on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The first commercial is a 60-second biographical sketch that
attempts to cast Bradley as a caring, influential and experienced
politician with a diverse background.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat surprisingly, the commercial skips across the parts of
Bradley's resume that he dwells on most in his stump speeches: his
small-town upbringing in Crystal City, Mo., and his experiences as
a star basketball player _ while focusing on Bradley's 18-year
tenure as a senator from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bradley has sought to portray himself as a political
outsider, the commercial includes a shot of the Capitol dome and
has two veteran senators, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York and
Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, both Democrats, praising him as a fighter
for tax fairness and against racism.
</P>
<P>
   The second advertisement lasts 30 seconds and features Bradley
speaking directly into the camera about how he is attempting to run
a ``different campaign'' that concentrates on issues instead of
sound bites.

 OPENING YOUNG EARS TO OPERA: Guild brings the romance and
temper  tantrums of `La Boheme' to schools  
 By SYLVIA RUBIN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In what must be a first, Puccini's ``La Boheme''
was compared to NBC's hit sitcom ``Friends''  &LR; the other day &LR; . &LR; 
 &LR; Well, there (set ital)are(end ital) roommates and romance. Also
sex, jealousy, flirtation and temper tantrums.
</P>
<P>
   It made sense to the 500 grade-schoolers who came to watch an
abbreviated version of the opera Monday morning at the Treasure
Island School. The cafeteria was overflowing with little bodies as
the curtain rose on Rodolfo, the poet, and Marcello, the painter,
in their cold attic apartment in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Even whittled to 45 minutes, this production by the San
Francisco Opera Guild _ featuring free-lance opera singers and nine
eighth-graders from the school in small speaking parts _ managed to
capture the essence of Puccini's tale of bohemian life in the
1830s.
</P>
<P>
   The Guild's school outreach education program, called Opera a la
Carte, will put on 130 performances of ``La Boheme'' this fall in
schools from Napa to San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Students who help put on the shows, from those with speaking
parts to the ones who paint the backdrops and stage-manage, will
attend a final dress rehearsal of San Francisco Opera's ``La
Boheme'' in early December. The opera opens December 4.
</P>
<P>
   Eighth-grader Annette Tran, who played the philosopher Colline,
said she wasn't sure what a philosopher is but thought she knew
what a bohemian is. She squinted her eyes and thought. ``Wait, I
remember my homework ... someone who is poor? A painter?''
</P>
<P>
   ``People from France. Writers and painters,'' said Shera Chhoth,
who plays a street kid.
</P>
<P>
   For months, the students in Manuel Tchakalian's music class have
been listening nonstop to a ``La Boheme'' recording with Luciano
Pavarotti and Mirella Freni.
</P>
<P>
   Tchakalian also happens to be a physical education teacher,
which strikes the kids as comical. He thinks this makes perfect
sense. ``Sports and music are both very emotional,'' he said.
``They are not passive activities. They are active.''
</P>
<P>
   In music class, his students said, Mr. T. is as active as an
umpire. He waves his arms around. He speaks in exclamation points.
``He gets so excited,'' said Tran. ``Sometimes, he cries.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He drops his glasses. He gets carried away,'' said My Linh Le,
who plays the guard.
</P>
<P>
   All true, the teacher admitted. ``I want them to really hear
Pavarotti. I was saying, `Listen! Listen!' My arm flew up _ that's
when my glasses came off.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, he added, he is Armenian. ``We are very emotional; we
are kind of crazy people,'' he said with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   Any opera, even a 45-minute one, is better than any commercial
music on the radio today, Tchakalian said.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Kerrigan, a former opera singer who is a Guild member and
Opera a la Carte producer, has been condensing great operas for 15
years and has learned to do it seamlessly. All the characters are
there: the landlord, Parpignol, the street kids, the cafe waiter.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the arias are there,'' she said. ``They are just
shortened.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Erina Newkirk, who plays Musetta, Marcello's on-again, off-again
girlfriend, got the audience's attention in Act 2 when she threw a
tantrum in the cafe and made Marcello jealous as she lifted her
skirts to flirt with her lover Alcindoro, played by eighth-grader
Don Huynh.
</P>
<P>
   The audience cracked up when Rodolfo (Jimmy Kansau) and Marcello
(Todd Donaran) clowned around in Act 4, just before Mimi (Hope
Riggs) arrived, too weak to walk.
</P>
<P>
   And there was respectful silence a few minutes later when Mimi
could no longer hang on to life.
</P>
<P>
   So what if this production had no lights and no supertitles? So
what if it was done on a tiny bare stage with no costume changes?
Puccini's characters were poor, after all. As Mimi lay dying on a
folding chair with a footstool under her feet, the emotions were
there. One teacher was caught weeping.
</P>
<P>
   As the curtain closed, the student actors were glad it was over.
Performing is so nerve-racking. Tell it to the cast and pianist Ron
Valentino, who flew to their cars after the show, taking off to
another school, another performance.
</P>
<P>
   After the show, the cast briefly took questions from the
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you get so mad?'' someone asked Newkirk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wouldn't you be mad if someone stepped on your foot, just for
the fun of it?'' Newkirk replied. ``You have to put yourself in
your character's place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you do your voice?'' another asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of practice,'' Donaran answered.

'72 TROJANS WERE `NEAR-PERFECT BLEND'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A different time, a different era, the argument
goes when comparing which championship team is better than another.
</P>
<P>
   So you would think with national championships in 1928, '31,
'32, '62, '67, '72, '74 and '78, you could be up for hours arguing
which USC team was the best of the century.
</P>
<P>
   But only if you threw out 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people have called it the best-balanced, best all-around
college football team there's ever been. And I'm inclined to
agree,'' said John McKay, who also coached three other national
championship teams at USC. ``It's the best I've ever seen. We
didn't have a single particular weakness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those fortunate things. We had a near-perfect
blend of experience and youth, and the seniors that season were
great leaders. It was an intelligent team, making the fewest mental
errors of any squad I've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   It might seem easy to take McKay's word for how dominating the
Trojans were, but others are just as adamant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, they are the best college football team I've seen. There
is no doubt about it,'' said Ohio State coach Woody Hayes, after
his No.3-ranked Buckeyes were crushed in the 1973 Rose Bowl 42-17.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their offense was as strong physically as any we've faced,''
said Arkansas coach Frank Broyles, after his No.4-ranked Razorbacks
were destroyed 31-10 in Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Before that game, Broyles sent a scout to Los Angeles to watch
the Trojans practice. His report said, ``When we line up against
USC, every one of our men is going to face the best player he's
ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Oregon State coach Dee Andros had this comment after a 51-6 loss
to the Trojans: ``They are a bunch of great athletes with one
overpowering factor: Their aggressiveness on both offense and
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Still skeptical?
</P>
<P>
   Let's review a few undisputed facts:
</P>
<P>
   _The Trojans were the first team in history to receive every
No.1 vote in the Associated Press and United Press International
polls.
</P>
<P>
   _They defeated their opponents by an average of 28 points and
never trailed a game in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   _Thirty-three players were drafted and 26 played a minimum of
one year in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   _The Trojans ranked in the top seven in the nation in scoring,
total offense, total defense, rushing defense and scoring defense.
</P>
<P>
   _Consider that a pair of USC legends _ tailback Anthony Davis
and quarterback Pat Haden _ were reserves, with Davis only
increasing his role after an injury to starter Rod McNeill.
</P>
<P>
   _They defeated six teams ranked in the top 18: No. 3 (Ohio
State), No. 4 (Arkansas), No. 10 (Notre Dame), No. 14 (UCLA), No.
15 (Stanford) and No. 18 (Stanford).
</P>
<P>
   And they weren't exactly nervous before they did it. Davis read
textbooks before the Trojans defeated UCLA 24-7 to earn their Rose
Bowl berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew if we came out and played our type of game, we'd pop
them,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a team so full of stars that McKay had trouble keeping
games close.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played as many reserves as I had and cleared the bench in
several games, but I was still accused of pouring it on,'' McKay
said. ``It was impossible to keep the score down, we were so
deep.''
</P>
<P>
   Five players were All-Americans that season: Tight end Charlie
Young, offensive tackle Pete Adams, fullback Sam Cunningham,
defensive tackle John Grant and linebacker Richard Wood.
</P>
<P>
   It was, as McKay said, a team with no apparent weakness. The
Trojans could run with Davis, McNeill and Cunningham. Quarterback
Mike Rae, who doubled as the kicker, could throw to Young, junior
wide receiver Lynn Swann or sprinter Edesel Garrison, who passed up
a chance to go to Munich Olympics to play football in '72.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie Young was as good a tight end as there was in
football, college or pro,'' McKay said. ``Swann will catch
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The offensive line, anchored by Adams and future 10-year pro
Steve Riley, was one of USC's best, and also featured Dave Brown,
Allan Graf, Allen Gallaher and future All-American and pro Booker
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The defense was as strong up front as in the back. The defensive
line was probably the Trojans' best ever, with tackles Grant and
Jeff Winans, nose guard Monte Doris along with defensive ends Dale
Mitchell and James Sims.
</P>
<P>
   Sims had a remarkable performance in the 51-6 victory over
Michigan State, with 11 tackles, two fumble recoveries and a pass
deflection.
</P>
<P>
   McKay marveled at Grant's ability to figure out opposing
offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grant could come out of the game after a few plays and explain
exactly what the other team was trying to do,'' McKay said.
</P>
<P>
   The linebackers were led by Wood, who was USC's only three-time
All-American. Free safety Artimus Parker was USC's all-time
interception leader with 20, and reserve Charles Phillips finished
his career with 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually all of those players reached their potential,'' said
John Robinson, an assistant on the team. ``But their real strength
was team play. Everyone focused first on the team goal, to win
every game, rather than on individual accomplishments.''
</P>
<P>
   The team-first mentality was instilled in the Trojans during
spring practice that year, when McKay decided to scrimmage three
times a week at the Coliseum. When Davis fumbled, he was chastised
by the offensive and defensive linemen, which quickly cured that
problem.
</P>
<P>
   It also helped that USC had gone 6-4-1 the previous two seasons
and was desperate to regain its national stature.
</P>
<P>
   Once the season began, the Trojans were just happy to find an
opponent to beat up.
</P>
<P>
   It started in the season opener when the eighth-ranked Trojans
traveled to fourth-ranked Arkansas. USC sent a message early, when
Razorbacks quarterback Joe Ferguson suffered a bloody and broken
nose, and cruised to a 31-10 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept us off-balance, all night, run or pass,'' Broyles
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans swept through their next three games, before beating
Stanford 30-21 in a game that wasn't as close as the score
indicated.
</P>
<P>
   No other team got any closer than 17 points to the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the major memories of that season came from Davis,
who started only three games but led the Trojans in rushing with
1,191 yards.
</P>
<P>
   He scored six touchdowns against Notre Dame, including kickoff
returns of 96 and 97 yards. He gained 178 yards in the victory
against UCLA, and christened his touchdown dance of bouncing
up-and-down on his knees.
</P>
<P>
   In the Rose Bowl, he gained 157 yards, although McKay let
Cunningham become the MVP by scoring four touchdowns. It was his
way of saying thank you, after making Cunningham block for so long.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Flags will be raised at half-staff today and Thursday
at Atlanta Motor Speedway in memory of Martinsville Speedway
founder H. Clay Earles, who died Tuesday morning after a yearlong
illness.
</P>
<P>
   Earles, 86, was one of the original builders of the track in
Martinsville, Va., and remained actively involved as co-owner and
CEO until his death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I remember the most about Mr. Earles was that he
always took care of the competitors,'' said driver Sterling Marlin.
``But he'd take care of the big boys and take care of the little
guys too.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the smaller teams would always go run his races
because they knew he'd take care of them and that he cared about
them.''
</P>
<P>
   AMS general manager and president Ed Clark was 8 years old when
he first met Earles.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASCAR racing has lost a great pioneer who dedicated every day
of his life to making our sport better,'' Clark said. ``Men like
Clay Earles laid the groundwork to make NASCAR racing one of the
most popular sports in America today.''
</P>
<P>
   Stricklin takes seat
</P>
<P>
   Due to a strange turn of events, Hut Stricklin signed a one-race
deal with Butch Mock Motorsports to drive the No. 75 Ford this
weekend at Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Musgrave, the team's former driver, provided one of the most
shocking scenes of the Winston Cup season when he parked his car
and quit during the middle of last Sunday's Pennzoil 400. Musgrave,
who was going to be replaced by Wally Dallenbach next season
anyway, said that he was tired of driving a ``non-competitive''
car.
</P>
<P>
   New deal for Elliott
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Elliott, brother of driver Bill Elliott, agreed Tuesday to
provide engines for the No. 9 Ford of Melling Racing for Sunday's
NAPA 500 and the entire 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a reunion for owner Mark Melling and Elliott, who
worked together for seven years before parting ways in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was somewhat of an emotional decision as my dad wanted
this partnership to materialize at some point,'' Melling said.
</P>
<P>
   Late for a reason
</P>
<P>
   Joe Nemechek won't be arriving in Atlanta until just before
qualifying on Friday so he can spend more time with his pregnant
wife. Andrea Nemechek will remain hospitalized until at least
Friday after suffering a broken shoulder, a fractured neck
vertebrae, several broken ribs and a small lung puncture when her
husband wrecked the family vehicle Sunday night in Concord, N.C.
Doctors said the injury will not effect the pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Extra laps
</P>
<P>
   Tony Stewart, the record-setting rookie driver, will make an
appearance from 3-5 p.m. today at the Home Depot in Dunwoody.
Stewart will also participate in a chat session on
www.homedepot.com from 8:30-9:15 p.m. Todd Bodine will sign
autographs at the Varsity downtown from 12-3:30 p.m. today. ...
Cicci-Welliver Racing announced that Tim Fedewa will return to the
No. 36 Busch team for next season.

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a
quarter of a percentage point on Tuesday, saying that the
combination of strong growth and low unemployment had left the
economy vulnerable to an outbreak of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third time this year that the central bank had raised
rates to check the economy's momentum, and the move clearly
signaled that the Fed's growing faith in technology's ability to
improve business efficiency and temper inflationary pressures has
its limits.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining its action, the Fed emphasized a concern that Alan
Greenspan, the central bank's chairman, has stressed repeatedly in
recent months: that the nation is literally running out of workers
and that, as it does so, wages and then prices will inevitably be
pushed higher, endangering an economic expansion that is about to
become the longest in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed said it was raising its benchmark federal funds target
rate on overnight loans between banks to 5.5 percent from 5.25
percent after two other quarter-point increases this year, in June
and August. Tuesday's increase took back the last of three
quarter-point reductions made last year in response to the global
financial crisis and left the rate back where it was 14 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank also said it would increase its largely
symbolic discount rates on loans to financial institutions from the
Federal Reserve system to 5 percent from 4.75 percent. It was the
second quarter-point increase in the rate this year after two
quarter-point reductions last year.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in the Fed's official short-term rates quickly
began to affect the rates paid by businesses and consumers. Banks
started raising their prime lending rate by a quarter of a point,
to 8.5 percent, a move that will in turn lead to higher rates on
credit card, automobile and other consumer loans. Rates set
directly or indirectly in the bond market, like those for mortgage
loans, also edged up.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed seemed to leave open the possibility that it could raise
rates further next year if the economy keeps roaring along and
unemployment keeps falling. But for investors, the good news was a
hint from the Fed that it does not plan to raise rates again at
least for the rest of this year. The central bank said the
cumulative effect of its three rate increases this year ``should
markedly diminish the risk of inflation going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed also removed its formal stance toward higher rates,
moving instead to a neutral one that analysts said all but ruled
out a rate increase at the next monetary policy meeting, which is
on Dec. 21.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose immediately after the
central bank's announcement Tuesday afternoon, fell back sharply,
then surged again to finish at 10,932.33, up 171.58 points.
</P>
<P>
   It was the highest level for the index in more than two months
and suggested that investors see no more rate increases coming
before the Fed's first meeting of 2000, on Feb. 1 and Feb. 2.
</P>
<P>
   The American economy has been growing steadily for more than
eight and a half years, driving unemployment down to 4.1 percent
last month _ the lowest level in nearly three decades _ while
allowing workers to enjoy higher wage gains than they have in
years. Yet there has been no solid evidence that inflation is
building, casting doubt on traditional economic models that predict
a trade-off between falling joblessness and rising wages and
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists have sought to explain the situation by
asserting that huge investments by businesses in computers and
other efficiency-enhancing technology are yielding substantial
improvements in productivity, or output per hour for each worker.
As productivity growth accelerates, it helps companies keep their
costs under control even if wages rise, making it possible for them
to maintain profit margins without increasing prices.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan and other Fed officials have increasingly come to
accept that recent gains in productivity are more than a temporary
blip, and they have been increasingly optimistic in their public
statements about the economy's resiliency and long-term growth
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   But in raising rates on Tuesday _ at a time when the economy is
already showing signs of slowing and price increases are well
contained _ Greenspan showed that he is not ready to abandon the
notion that low unemployment plus robust growth is a recipe for
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although cost pressures appear generally contained, risks to
sustainable growth persist,'' the Fed's Federal Open Market
Committee said in a statement released soon after 2:15 p.m.
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite tentative evidence of slowing in certain
interest-sensitive sectors of the economy and of accelerating
productivity, the expansion of activity continues in excess of the
economy's growth potential,'' the statement said. ``As a
consequence, the pool of available workers willing to take jobs has
been drawn down further in recent months, a trend that must
eventually be contained if inflationary imbalances are to remain in
check and economic expansion continue.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Economists had been sharply divided before Tuesday's meeting
about whether a rate increased would be justified, and the Fed's
decision led some of them to assert that the central bank was
failing to take account of the economy's improved capacity to grow
without inflation. They said the Fed should have taken more time to
let its previous two rate increases this year slow the economy and
ease pressure on labor markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this was a football game, I think I'd throw a yellow flag
for piling on,'' said Martin Regalia, an economist at the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Regalia said that while the Fed's ``rhetoric seems to have
shifted to an acceptance of productivity gains, their actions are
clearly more consistent with the traditional labor market tightness
arguments.''
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts said the economy was continuing to grow at a rate
greater than the 3 percent to 3.5 percent annual rate that is
widely viewed as a ``speed limit'' beyond which inflation can take
root.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fed believes, as I do, that the economy's speed limit is
higher than we thought it was a few years back, but that doesn't
mean in any sense that the economy does not still have a speed
limit,'' said Richard Berner, an economist at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter in New York.
</P>
<P>
   With growth exceeding that limit and showing no clear signs of
moderating, Berner said, ``the balance of inflation risks still
lies to the side of higher rather than lower inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before Tuesday's statement suggesting that the Fed will be
on hold for the rest of this year, analysts had expected the
central bank to leave rates untouched for several months because of
the uncertainty about how the Year 2000 computer problem will
affect the economy and the financial system.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, economists expect that it could be difficult
for the Fed to draw conclusions about the economy's path over the
next few months because statistics may be distorted by businesses
building extra inventory and consumers holding on to more cash than
they otherwise would. As a result, some analysts think the Fed
might shy away from raising rates at its February meeting even if
growth seems to remain strong.
</P>
<P>
   The question over the longer run is whether the economy will
again defy predictions that it is about to slow, leading the Fed to
consider further rate increases next year.
</P>
<P>
   The economy has been growing steadily since March 1991. In
January, barring a collapse in the next six weeks, it will set a
new milestone, breaking the record for the longest expansion in the
nation's history, eight years and 10 months, which was set during
the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   During the last several years growth has proved remarkably
impervious to both shocks from the rest of the world and higher
interest rates at home, and it seems to have drawn sustenance in
particular from the boom in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Fed officials insist that they have not set out to push Wall
Street lower, but they say they remain concerned that the market's
buoyancy, even in the face of tighter monetary policy, is helping
to keep consumer demand at a higher level than they are comfortable
with.

BOY CONVICTED OF SECOND-DEGREE MURDER IN KILLING COMMITTED WHEN HE
WAS 11 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs 2nd graf to change `all but six states' to `at least 44
states'; the statistics are not up to date) 
(bl)  
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTIAC, Mich. _ A state jury on Tuesday found a boy guilty of
second-degree murder for a killing he committed when he was 11. He
is believed to be the youngest American ever tried and convicted of
murder as an adult, in a case that has highlighted a national trend
toward putting children on trial as adults.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, at least 44 states have adopted new juvenile justice
laws that allow more children to be tried as adults, with Michigan
adopting one of the toughest statutes of all in 1996. Civil
liberties and human rights groups have opposed these laws,
contending that treating children as adults will turn them into
hardened criminals.
</P>
<P>
   But many state-level Republican politicians have led campaigns
for adult trials and long prison sentences for juvenile offenders,
using the slogan, ``adult crime, adult time.'' Michigan Gov. John
Engler, a Republican, welcomed Tuesday's verdict, saying that
11-year-olds were mature enough to understand the seriousness of
firing a gun.
</P>
<P>
   The convicted boy, Nathaniel Abraham, was 11 years and 9 months
old when he went out on a hillside here in this northern suburb of
Detroit on the evening of Oct. 29, 1997. He used a borrowed,
.22-caliber rifle to shoot a stranger who was walking out of a
convenience store, killing him with a single bullet in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel could receive a sentence of up to life in prison. But
prosecutors said they would ask that he be incarcerated initially
in a juvenile detention center and reassessed at ages 19 and 21 to
determine whether he had been rehabilitated enough for release or
should be sent to a prison for adults.
</P>
<P>
   The jury acquitted Nathaniel of first-degree murder, which would
have required the prosecution to prove him guilty of planning the
killing. But while the judge in the case, Judge Eugene Moore, gave
the jury the option of finding Nathaniel guilty of involuntary
manslaughter, the jury ended up choosing instead the charge of
second-degree murder, which requires proof that the killing was
intentional.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that he knew the firearm was dangerous,'' said jury
foreman Daniel Stolz. The jury deliberated for four days before
reaching a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel, who was impassive during the trial, appeared shaken
but did not cry when the verdict was read. ``He doesn't understand
it, he literally never has,'' said Geoffrey Fieger, a prominent
lawyer who defended Nathaniel for free. Fieger contended during the
trial that Nathaniel lacked the mental capacity to be held
responsible for his actions. Court-appointed psychologists found
that Nathaniel had below-average intelligence for his age and
limited ability to control anger.
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel's mother wept at the verdict while the victim's mother
said in an interview that she was pleased. ``Justice has been
served,'' said Robin Adams, the mother of the slain man, Ronnie
Greene Jr. ``The child has a lot of anger in him and someone needs
to reach out to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Fieger said his law firm had checked with officials in all 50
states and found that Nathaniel was the first American ever tried
for murder as an adult and convicted for a killing at such a young
age. But Melissa Sickmund, a senior research associate at the
National Center for Juvenile Justice, a non-profit group in
Pittsburgh, was more cautious about declaring Nathaniel the
youngest, citing a paucity of state and federal statistics on very
young offenders. A federal report earlier this autumn on juvenile
justice noted that children as young as seven were tried as adults
during the eighteenth century.
</P>
<P>
   The jury here in Oakland County Circuit Court acquitted
Nathaniel, who now 13 years old, three other charges, including
felony possession of a firearm during the murder. Fieger said he
would file a motion within a week asking Moore to overturn the
guilty verdict on the second-degree murder charge, on the grounds
that Nathaniel should not be found guilty of fatally shooting
someone while acquitted of possessing a gun to fire the shot.
</P>
<P>
   But Patricia Mell, a professor of criminal law at Michigan State
University, questioned whether the motion would be successful.
``Just because verdicts are inconsistent doesn't necessarily mean
that they're overturned,'' she said. Although defendants in
Michigan are sometimes found guilty of firearms possession and
acquitted of a related crime, Professor Mell said that it was very
unusual for the reverse to occur.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary hearing on the sentencing was scheduled for Dec.
14. But Lisa Halushka, the assistant Oakland County prosecutor who
handled the case, said that it was likely to be postponed because
various trial records needed to be prepared and Nathaniel might
need to be interviewed again by a court-appointed psychologist.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Fieger said he believed that race had played a role in the
prosecution and conviction of Nathaniel, who is black. He said
Nathaniel would never have been charged with murder in neighboring
Wayne County, which encompasses Detroit and is heavily black.
Oakland County is only 8 percent black, and was mainly settled in
the 1960s and 1970s by whites fleeing Detroit. There was only one
black, an elderly man, on Nathaniel's jury; the jury had seven
women and five men.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Halushka strongly denied that race had played any role.
</P>
<P>
   Fieger indirectly acknowledged during the trial that Nathaniel
had fired the shot that killed Greene, who was 18 at the time of
his death, and who was black. Fieger said Nathaniel had been
shooting at trees, and that Greene's death had been a tragic
accident.
</P>
<P>
   But the prosecution said that Nathaniel told classmates before
the killing that he planned to shoot someone. He engaged in target
practice, shot his victim, went home and watched television and
bragged about the incident the next day to a classmate, the
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, Fieger contended that Nathaniel was 288 feet
from Greene at the time of the shooting, and could not have hit him
deliberately at such a distance with the rifle, which was 30 years
old and missing its stock. Defense witnesses also suggested that
the bullet entered Greene's head so far above the hairline that the
bullet must have ricocheted off a tree branch overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Halushka offered a very different account during the trial.
She said that Nathaniel was only 200 feet from Greene, and that
Nathaniel had used balloons for target practice during the days
before Greene's death. Prosecution witnesses also contended that
Greene's bullet wound was consistent with his having tilted his
head at the moment of impact, and did not indicate that the bullet
had struck him from above. Nathaniel was firing from a steep
hillside overlooking the convenience store.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Michigan is one of the leaders in a move by Republicans to allow
ever younger children to be tried as adults with a judge's
permission and for an ever lengthening list of crimes. A
three-year-old state law allows prosecutors to ask judges for
permission to try any youth as an adult, no matter how young. Until
the law was passed, children had to be at least 14 to be tried as
an adult with a judge's permission. Other states have also been
lowering this age to as young as 10.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan has long mandated that anyone 17 or older be tried
automatically as an adult, unlike many other states and the federal
government, which require that a defendant be at least 18 to be
automatically considered an adult. While Michigan once had a
reputation for liberalism, the state's increasingly conservative
Republican Party now controls the state's House and Senate, as well
as the governor's mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Halushka said that Tuesday's verdict would make sure that
Nathaniel would receive treatment and not pose a risk to society.
But Fieger predicted that Oakland County would be ridiculed for
Tuesday's decision, adding, ``The rest of the world will rightfully
scorn this and hold us in contempt.''
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International U.S.A., the American arm of the global
human rights group, condemned Tuesday's verdict. ``As America
exhorts other nations to uphold basic human rights principles, we
should begin with the ABC's of human rights and treat our own young
offenders as children _ not as adults,'' said Curt Goering, the
American group's senior deputy executive director.

 &HT;    Jewish General Assembly opens
 &HT;    By Jeffry Scott
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At Hartsfield International Airport Tuesday, Alon
Baker got off a plane from Israel and found this greeting written
on a poster held by a volunteer from the Atlanta Jewish community:
</P>
<P>
   ``Shalom Y'all. Welcome to Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   And with that _ and a free bag of boiled peanuts _ he became one
of more than 4,000 Jews from around the world arriving here for a
three-day conference, the 68th annual General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The conference _ at least the first registration day _ was
almost as much about the condition of Southern hospitality as it
was about the global state of the Jewish faith and international
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if there's a particularly Jewish Southern food,''
said Linda Selig, co-chair of the conference, which is being hosted
by the Jewish Federation of Greater Atlanta. ``Maybe it's lox and
grits?''
</P>
<P>
   Selig was talking on the convention hall floor of the Marriott
Marquis downtown, where a steady stream of conventioneers and
delegates from around the world were registering for the meetings,
which will feature Vice President Al Gore as the kickoff speaker
this afternoon and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak Friday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   She was clutching a cell phone, and in her eye was the edgy look
of a host expecting roughly 4,000 people for dinner, at her place _
tonight. She wasn't far wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, with the help of Selig and other organizers, 24
prominent members of Atlanta's Jewish community _ including Chuck
Wolf and Charles Ackerman _ opened their homes and liquor cabinets
and set out Kosher snacks for the visiting multitude.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Dimant, 53, of Toronto, is a member of B'nai B'rith, a
Jewish service organization, and has attended four General
Assemblies in other cities around the country. He said he isn't
surprised at the city's down-home hospitality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected the people to be warm and gracious,'' he said.
``This is Atlanta, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   At the home of Peter and Margo Savitz, about 50 delegates
arrived by bus in the early evening and mingled in the dining room
over Kosher finger food _ vegetables and dips; chips; nuts,
California roll sushi _ and in the kitchen, nursing beverages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a very distinct difference between Jews in the
South, and Jews from other parts of the country,'' said Anne
Firestone, visiting from Orange County, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``Southern Jews are nicer, more friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   Margo Savitz said she would liked to have put on a bigger spread
of food _ fried chicken wouldn't have been a bad idea _ but ``we
had to be careful to be considerate of dietary laws.'' Otherwise,
there were few convivialities not exchanged through the day,
between this community and the world's, and old friends who make
the annual assembly a reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a running conversation, and it's just that (there's
a) 365-day gap between sentences,'' said Ivan Michael Schaeffer,
national chairman of United Jewish Communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will not be able to escape the fact that there will be
hundreds of people hugging and kissing around here.''

   Genentech Inc., the nation's pioneering biotechnology company,
has agreed to settle its long-running patent battle with the
University of California over genetically engineered human growth
hormones.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is scheduled to come before the UC Board of
Regents' finance committee at a closed meeting Wednesday night and
to be approved by the full board in an open session Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement will cost Genentech $200 million, according to a
report in The Los Angeles Times. That would be the largest payment
ever for patent infringement in the burgeoning biotechnology
sector, where it sometimes seems as if every breakthrough is
accompanied by a trip to court to settle who owns it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to comment until it is completely final,''
said Laura Leber, a spokeswoman for Genentech, which is based in
South San Francisco, Calif. Several spokesmen at the university
said they could not comment until Friday. Lawyers involved in the
negotiations declined to comment or did not return calls.
</P>
<P>
   Patent lawyers said a $200 million settlement might be among the
five largest in any patent case, although such figures are often
kept private and the actual value of an agreement can be
complicated by cross-licensing when both parties are businesses.
But analysts said the settlement would not be a major burden for
Genentech.
</P>
<P>
   Growth hormones, which are used to encourage growth in short
children and to treat a number of adult diseases, accounted for
just over a fifth of Genentech's $1.15 billion in revenue last
year. The company has more than $1 billion in cash as well as the
deep pockets of Roche Holdings, its majority owner.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech's shares jumped $4.25, to $76 yesterday. Analysts said
the climb reflected both general buying of biotechnology stocks and
optimism about Genentech's drug pipeline. The analysts said
positive buzz about a Genentech drug being developed for asthma and
hay fever and an abstract posted yesterday on the Web site of the
American Society of Hematology about results with Rituxan,
Genentech's drug for non-Hodgkins lymphoma cancer, both lifted the
stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the settlement would have had much of an impact
one way or another in a neutral market,'' said David Molowa, who
follows the company for Bear Stearns.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the settlement may have been a relief for some
investors. The university sued Genentech in 1990, five years after
the company began selling its Protropin hormone. When the case
finally reached trial in federal court in San Francisco earlier
this year, Genentech fared badly. A jury unanimously rejected
Genentech's argument that the university's patents were invalid and
came within one vote of deciding Protropin had infringed it.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides were scheduled to retry the infringement issue in
January in a trial that would have covered both Protropin and a
second hormone product, Nutropin. The hormones are produced in
bacteria that have the gene that codes for the human hormones
spliced into their own DNA. Had the new jury decided the company
was guilty of willful infringement, the university could have been
awarded $2.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The patent dispute grew out of research at the university's San
Francisco campus led by Howard Goodman, Peter Seeburg and John
Shine, all of whom have since moved on. Seeburg's first stop after
leaving the school in 1978 was Genentech, which had been founded
just two years earlier. His decision to return to the campus on
Dec. 31, 1978 and take genetic material he had been working on to
Genentech led to accusations that Genentech's first growth hormones
not only infringed on the school's patent but owed their existence
to theft of its property.
</P>
<P>
   The misappropriation dispute was settled in 1980 when Genentech
agreed to pay up to $2 million in royalties. Genentech has denied
that Seeburg's materials played a role in subsequent development of
commercial products. Those products are not genetically identical
to the hormone genes isolated, cloned and patented at the
university, so the battle has been over whether they violate the
hazier portion of the law that bars products that are
``substantially equivalent.''

PLEDGES BY ULSTER RIVALS BREAK THE DEADLOCK AT TALKS
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Leads with 8 grafs to restructure, add background on talks
and conflict, fresh quote from Trimble; Pickup 7th graf pvs,
Notably, Trimble ...)

<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ Northern Ireland's rival parties
exchanged unusually conciliatory statements and pledges Tuesday,
raising expectations of an imminent break in the stalemate blocking
progress in their peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In a long-conflicted corner of northern Europe where politics is
normally articulated in snubs and taunts, the companion statements
by leaders of Sinn Fein and the Ulster Unionist Party held out real
promise of success for the 11-week effort by George Mitchell, the
former U.S. senator, to mediate a power-sharing administration and
civil peace for the province.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the political ally of the
Irish Republican Army, said his party ``wishes to work with, not
against the unionists'' and addressed their principal concern by
saying that paramilitary disarmament would be a vital part of any
political settlement and that violent conflict is ``now a thing of
the past, over, done with and gone.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement passed out at the Stormont Castle buildings where
that talks conducted by Mitchell are ending on a surge of optimism,
Adams declared, ``IRA guns are silent, and the Sinn Fein leadership
is confident that the IRA remains committed to the objective of a
permanent peace.'' The outlawed underground force has maintained a
cease-fire for more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   The Ulster Unionist leader, David Trimble, reading his
deliberately worded statement from the steps of the office complex,
said: ``We now have a chance to create a genuine partnership
between unionists and nationalists in a novel form of government.
The UUP is committed to the principles of inclusivity, equality and
mutual respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Ulster Unionists are those, mostly Protestant, who favor keeping
Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom while nationalists and
republicans, who tend to be Catholics, favor eventual union with
the Irish Republic. The conflict between them and the paramilitary
violence it has spawned has cost more than 3,300 lives in the last
three decades.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle Trimble now faces in persuading his increasingly
hard-line party to adopt his formula for cultural compromise did
not deter him from making a remarkable admission for a man
practiced in the tribal politics of Northern Ireland. ``For too
long,'' he said, ``much of the unrest in our community has been
caused by a failure to accept the differing expressions of cultural
identity.'' He spoke of the need for ``mutual respect and tolerance
rather than division and alienation.''
</P>
<P>
   The striking dialogue drew a comment filled with wonder from
Monica McWilliams of the Women's Coalition, which was a party to
the original peace talks that produced the April 1998 accord.
``These are kinds of statements that we thought were never possible
in Northern Ireland,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Notably, Trimble said that the deadlock over guerrilla
disarmament _ which has prevented a start-up of the political
institutions created by the accord _ would end if the IRA agreed to
name a go-between to the independent commission on disarmament
headed by a retired Canadian general, John de Chastelain. That is
precisely the pledge the IRA is expected to make in its own
statement on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The choreographed series of remarks began with statements Monday
from Mitchell, de Chastelain and various party leaders and were
intended to win over the many distrustful members of Trimble's
party.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of Ulster Unionists have adopted a
line-in-the-sand position called ``no guns, no government.'' They
insist that the proposed Northern Ireland coalition government,
structured to divide power among the Protestant majority and the
Catholic minority, can take office only when the IRA begins
dismantling its arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   As favorable as the prospects were becoming for putting the
peace agreement into effect after 19 months of stubborn delay, the
struggle to obtain the necessary Ulster Unionist support in a Nov.
27 meeting of the 850-member party council remains a formidable
obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   As the Mitchell rescue mission progressed, it increasingly
focused on Trimble and Adams, men who previously had not even been
capable of speaking to each another but who in recent weeks have
become comfortable together. The Ulster Unionist leader
consequently emerged with a belief in the dependability of Sinn
Fein promises that he will now have to put to his doubting party
members. They have had either no dealings, or exclusively hostile
ones, with Adams, a much demonized figure in their community.
</P>
<P>
   If Trimble succeeds in swaying his party, the nomination of the
members of the cabinet to run the Northern Ireland Assembly and the
passage of the legislation in the House of Commons transferring
home rule powers from London to Belfast would follow in days.
Disarmament would begin two months later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we'll be able to get to work on the real business, and I
can say for myself and for my party colleagues, we are bursting to
get at the real jobs,'' said Trimble in an ebullient appearance at
a jobs announcement ceremony in nearby Portadown Tuesday afternoon
with Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary, Peter Mandelson.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson, a close aide to Prime Minister Tony Blair, has a
reputation as a crafty and effective persuader. He has offered to
travel the province in the coming days to reassure Ulster Unionist
gatherings about sharing government with Sinn Fein even in the
absence of immediate disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   He urged critics Tuesday to examine all the statements being
made before making up their minds. ``We must not allow people to
dismiss the process,'' he said, ``before it has been completed.''

THE GARDEN LOSES A STAR: SERENA WILLIAMS QUITS TOURNAMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ All beads and bravado, she was supposed to be making
a much-ballyhooed debut Tuesday night in the Chase Championships at
Madison Square Garden. By the time the paying customers arrived
with their legitimate expectations of watching the 1999 U.S. Open
champion clobber the competition, the 18-year-old Serena Williams
was already back home in Florida sharing a couch with her Jack
Russell terrier.
</P>
<P>
   It was a triple blow to the marquee: no Serena for singles, no
more plotting for an all-Williams-sisters final, no more Williams
sisters doubles team.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Williams sister, ranked fourth and threatening to
overtake her older sister, abruptly withdrew from the tournament
Tuesday morning after straining her back while practicing forehand
volleys.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a few forehand volleys, I suddenly felt an excruciating
pain in the upper left side of my back,'' she said. ``I didn't feel
anything pop or pull, but all of a sudden I couldn't move, run,
walk, and even the simplest task of breathing became nearly
impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Steffi Graf, the living legend who collected 22 Grand
Slam championships and ruled women's tennis with her iron forehand,
spending a record 377 weeks at No. 1, was honored with a gala
retirement ceremony between matches Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Graf, 30, officially retired in August before the U.S. Open. The
ceremony was attended by most of the 16 Chase singles participants.
</P>
<P>
   ``One moment in time, I've felt like I've had so many of
those,'' said Graf, visibly moved by the five-minute standing
ovation she received from her fans. ``I'll miss you.''
</P>
<P>
   The former New York Knicks Earl Monroe and Dave DeBusschere
raised a banner to the rafters that listed the years of her five
championship seasons here.

 &HT;    Warrick expects Gator assault
 &HT;    By Tom D'Angelo
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Speaking to reporters for the first time
since his ill-advised, ``I didn't kill the president'' remark,
Florida State receiver Peter Warrick labeled his involvement in a
department store scam ``immature'' and ``bad judgment'' before
sending a message to Florida's defensive backs. When asked how he
would cover Peter Warrick, Warrick said: ``I probably wouldn't show
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Warrick, though, isn't looking forward to facing the Gators'
fans when the top-ranked Seminoles visit No. 3 Florida on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really like playing away, not since I got in
trouble,'' he said. ``They try to dog me. I know it's going to be
the same way like Clemson and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're (Florida) a great team. What scares me is the crowd.
You can't hear anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans at Clemson and Virginia taunted Warrick with chants of
``jailbird,'' dressed in prison stripes with No. 9 on their backs
and displayed signs referring to Warrick's arrest for accepting
illegally discounted merchandise at Dillard's in September. One
sign played off the popular ``John 3:16'' Bible verse sign seen at
many football games. It read, ``Pete 21.40,'' referring to the
amount Warrick and a former teammate paid for more than $420 worth
of clothing.
</P>
<P>
   At Virginia, Warrick said he had beer dumped on him after the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw those signs it was funny, but it really hurt me
that probably people who used to like me were showing signs,''
Warrick said.''But deep down inside I was laughing about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly what Seminoles coach Bobby Bowden is telling
Warrick to do when he steps onto Florida Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how many of them will (taunt Warrick), but there
certainly will be one in the crowd ... 20, 30, 100, 1,000, maybe
10,000, depending on how many sacks Dillard's has got,'' Bowden
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pete is a very sensitive guy. Pete is a good guy. He doesn't
want to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   But Warrick hasn't exactly been taking a low-key approach on the
field. In his first game back after serving a two-game suspension,
he ran his finger across his neck, giving the cut-throat sign to
the Clemson players as they ran onto the field. In Virginia, he ran
up to the section where the Cavaliers' school band and students sit
and taunted them before police intervened.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick's reaction may have been out of frustration over subpar
performances at Clemson and Virginia, spotty efforts for the player
once considered the front-runner for the Heisman Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   FSU offensive coordinator Mark Richt sai he had to ``call out''
Warrick in front of his teammates for his poor practices. Before
the suspension, Warrick had been one of the team's hardest-working
players. But, Richt said, ``He came back practicing about like he
did his sophomore year. I wasn't real happy about his practices
until (last Monday).''
</P>
<P>
   Richt had seen enough two days before the Virginia game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lackadaisical Thursday practice,'' Richt said. ``We
wore shorts and everybody thought it was a day off and the tempo
was horrible. I got on his case a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, the week of the Maryland game, Warrick appeared relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a great week of practice, as good as I've seen him
practice,'' quarterback Chris Weinke said. ``There seemed to be a
determination more so than I've seen before in him. He was having
fun out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Warrick warmed up for Florida with nine catches for 134 yards
and three touchdowns against Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Warrick does not believe that a repeat performance of
last season's win over Florida _ eight catches for 119 yards and a
touchdown and a touchdown pass he threw _ will help him get back
into the Heisman race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I shot myself in the foot by the mistake I made,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   That mistake resulted in Warrick pleading guilty to first-degree
misdemeanor petty theft, with one year probation and 30 days in the
county work program. Warrick said he was against pleading to a
felony or serving time in jail, both of which were an option.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they were talking about taking the felony, I wasn't going
to take that felony,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about (jail) a lot. My mom (said), `Pete, you ain't
doing no jail time. It's not like you're a criminal. I know you
made a mistake but you don't deserve to do 30 days in jail.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like she was right. It hurt me deep inside that
somebody wanted me to spend time in jail for what I did. I know I
was wrong. I know I made a bad judgment. I've just got to move on
from my mistakes. I know that's something I will never do again.''

UCLA'S GRAU HAS DIFFICULT DAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Two weeks ago, in the midst of UCLA's demoralizing
three-game losing streak, a 240-pound mass of perspective walked
onto Spaulding Field in the form of Bruins long snapper Jeff Grau.
</P>
<P>
   For several days, Grau had been a witness in a murder trial in
Santa Monica Municipal Court. The victim: his brother, Michael.
</P>
<P>
   On June 1, 1998, in Westchester, Michael Grau, 27, was shot in
the heart by his ex-girlfriend's boyfriend during an argument.
</P>
<P>
   In the trial, the shooter told the jury that because of two
tumors in his back, doctors had removed the protective bone plate
from his lower spine. That made him susceptible to paralysis if
struck in the back.
</P>
<P>
   Since he and Michael Grau had been in fights before, the shooter
claimed self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   The jury agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come to peace with it, but my dad (Howard) has had a
really hard time,'' Grau said. ``It's been rough, but all my
friends have helped me out as much as they could to get my mind off
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's made me realize that even though we were losing, it's
great to be here. It's put everything that's happened this season
in perspective. Life is short, and football is fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Stat of the day: UCLA coach Bob Toledo is unbeaten in the city
series. He was 3-0 as a USC assistant in the 1970s, 2-0 as a UCLA
assistant (1994-95), and 3-0 as the Bruins' boss.
</P>
<P>
   Good memory: Toledo has not forgotten USC tailback Chad Morton's
preseason promise that the Trojans would defeat UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was brought up Monday, it was brought up (Tuesday), and I
think it will be brought up a few more times,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Roster update: Tight end Bryan Fletcher (sprained ankle),
defensive tackle Ken Kocher (sprained ankle) and offensive tackle
Blake Worley (sprained knee) are probable. They are not expected to
start.
</P>
<P>
   Safety Lovell Houston (concussion) has not been cleared to play;
Julius Williams probably will start.
</P>
<P>
   Senior tailback Keith Brown's career is over after fracturing
his shoulder against Washington. ``It's just unexpected to end my
senior year like this,'' Brown said. ``I was really looking forward
to the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Without Brown, Kenny Pritchett becomes the third-string
tailback.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Drew Bennett is the No. 3 quarterback, but he'll spend
the week at receiver. The Bruins barely have enough time to get
starting quarterback Ryan McCann and backup Scott McEwan ready,
much less Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Ricky Manning Jr. will return punts again this week.
</P>
<P>
   Changing it up: The Bruins switched Pasadena hotels last week
for the first time in school history to be closer to their Friday
night destination: ``The Fight Club.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the film received just two positive reviews _ from
center Matt Phelan and defensive tackle Pete Holland _ the change
of routine had the desired effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were pretty loose before the game, which is not where you'd
expect us to be,'' Holland said. ``I think it helped a little.''

   After being eliminated from the race for chief executive, A.
Barry Rand resigned as executive vice president at Xerox in January
and announced his goal to run a Fortune 500 company. On Nov. 9, Mr.
Rand, 55, got his wish, landing at Avis Rent A Car, a company based
on Long Island that expects to make Fortune's list in April.
</P>
<P>
   I aspired to run my own company, and that wasn't going to happen
at Xerox. Paul Allaire, Xerox's chairman, selected an external
candidate to succeed him. We didn't have a debate about his choice.
We'd known each other for quite some time.
</P>
<P>
   That's when I thought I was going to look elsewhere. But he
asked me to stay on and would have appointed me vice chairman this
year. I said OK But then I asked myself why I was staying, and I
didn't like the answers: that vice chairman was a nice title, that
the job was comfortable, that I was making good money.
</P>
<P>
   I felt like a hypocrite. I'd always taught my family that you
have to take risks. You have to stay faithful to your dreams. Life
is about hurdles, and you have to be a hurdler in life.
</P>
<P>
   When I took over Xerox's distribution operations in 1986, we had
problems everywhere. I quickly realized you can't just sit in the
hallowed halls of headquarters and depend on the next tier of
executives. You have to get out and talk to customers, talk to
employees. I don't mind saying, ``I don't know.'' I have the
self-confidence to say that. I don't mind the risk of being seen as
the person who doesn't know it all.
</P>
<P>
   I started some new businesses and changed the culture. Xerox
became a world-class organization. That increased my expectation
level. It made me believe I can compete with the best in the world.
So I said, ``Why not? Why shouldn't I run my own company one day?''
The goal snuck up on me. I also asked myself what I love in life.
And I realized that running businesses and developing teams gave me
the same sort of psychic energy that I got when was I playing
football and basketball back at Archbishop Carroll High School in
Washington, when I thought I was an athlete.
</P>
<P>
   So I quit and went out looking for a company to run. The caution
I got from many executive recruiters was don't jump for the first
thing. So I kept myself busy searching and analyzing the job
market. I wasn't around the house looking for things to do. My wife
would say, ``I thought you were supposed to be relaxing. You're
traveling all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Then I had another goal. I wanted to be reacquainted with my
wife and 16-year-old son and 8-year-old daughter. So I was OK with
waiting. Over the summer, we went to Morocco, London, Florida,
California and several islands.
</P>
<P>
   When we got back, I turned to the search full time. I didn't
want this to go beyond a year. At the recommendation of Ken
Chenault of American Express, Cendant had contacted me about a
board seat. Avis wasn't looking for a C.E.O. at the time. A
triumverate was leading the company. But Stephen Holmes, a board
member at both companies, and I quickly realized I was a great
match with Avis. Now I'm here. The eagle has landed.

FOR 2 ALL-BUT-DECLARED SENATE CANDIDATES, PRESSURE TO DECLARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hillary Rodham Clinton and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani had
been planning formal campaign announcements as soon as this
January, complete with all the usual trappings: balloons and
speeches, endorsements and a statewide flyaround.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Clinton has now postponed her announcement until
February, if not later, and Giuliani's advisers are hinting he may
forgo one altogether.
</P>
<P>
   From one perspective, a simple announcement by either person, as
one Democratic member of Congress put it Tuesday, would be an
elaborate exercise in stating the obvious, since both have been
engaged in full-bore politicking since last summer.
</P>
<P>
   But obvious or not, pressure seems to be growing _ particularly
in the case of Mrs. Clinton _ to get in or out of the race finally
and formally. With each passing day and each new reported delay,
there is another quiver of concern that either of these candidates
may be suffering a case of the political butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she needs to announce very soon,'' said Judith Hope,
the chairwoman of the state Democratic Committee. ``I truly do.
That's one of the things that needs to happen. I'm urging her to do
so.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the concern and speculation, if hard to ignore in
political circles these days, is built upon a questionable
foundation. Mrs. Clinton and Giuliani have repeatedly all but said
they are in the race to stay. And aides to both said in interviews
Tuesday that the prospect that either would not run was remote,
although certainly not, by a long shot, absurd.
</P>
<P>
   But the seriousness of Mrs. Clinton's intentions has clearly
become the subject of widespread discussion, especially after the
political difficulties Mrs. Clinton experienced during her trip to
the Middle East, for which she was criticized by Jewish leaders
back home. One Democratic consultant, Hank Sheinkopf, said Tuesday
that he had taken four telephone calls from party members and
reporters trading rumors about an imminent withdrawal by Mrs.
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Emily Giske, a longtime Democratic political strategist and a
vice chairman of the state Democratic Party, said she sensed a
growing rumble surrounding the first lady, notwithstanding her own
certainty that Mrs. Clinton will run. She suggested that both
candidates might take a lesson from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in New York don't like tentativeness,'' Ms. Giske said.
``We want our coffee right away, and we don't like to wait for
subways. We're impatient people: Everybody wants her to announce,
and they want the mayor to announce. They want to know what the
field is going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's political plans have been the subject of more
scrutiny than those of Giuliani in no small part because of her
tenuous ties to New York. Mrs. Clinton has yet to move into the
house that she and President Clinton bought in Chappaqua earlier
this month, and which is being renovated for security by the Secret
Service. Mrs. Clinton's advisers said it would be implausible for
her to make an announcement until she has a home in the state.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a constant undercurrent of speculation that Mrs.
Clinton, a pragmatic and cautious politician who could presumably
pick the state she wants to run from, might decide to step out of
what a series of polls suggest may turn out to be a very tough
race. Some of this conjecture has been pushed, if sotto voce, by
Giuliani's allies who have an obvious interest in trying to spook
her in these early days.
</P>
<P>
   But the suggestions have come from Democrats as well. ``There's
a lot more whispering now about, can she get out of the race,''
George Stephanopoulos, the former Clinton adviser, said on ABC's
``This Week'' news program. He added: ``It's become a joyless
campaign. There's not a lot of momentum and energy. I think all of
the people around her say there's no way she's going to get out.
But there's a lot more people in the Democratic Party now who wish
that she would.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the mayor, a number of politicians have argued the real
draw for Giuliani to this contest is the chance to run against Mrs.
Clinton, as opposed to being one of 100 people in the Senate.
Should she drop out, this becomes just another race for the Senate,
and Giuliani might be tempted to stand aside and wait for a job
more suited to his interest, such as the attorney general in a
Republican administration.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, there have been reasons for both Mrs. Clinton and
Giuliani to avoid a formal announcement. It has allowed them to
avoid the expenditures of hiring staff members and avoids the risk
of overexposure of the two candidates to the public.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Once he announces, the mayor is likely to have to give up his
weekly forum of a radio show. And, one of his senior advisers noted
Tuesday, ``He does best when he is seen as mayor as opposed to
candidate. Why not remain in our strongest position as long as we
possibly can?'' Giuliani didn't bother to formally announce his
decision to run for re-election two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And it is, as Mrs. Clinton's advisers noted, a full year before
Election Day. Charles Schumer did not announce his candidacy for
the Senate until April, or eight months before the election.
</P>
<P>
   An announcement, though, gives the candidates a chance to lay
out the underlying themes of their campaign, to one of the larger
audiences of the race. ``There seems to be a kind of rule in the
printed press and the electronic press that this is the one day you
get to say something and they will actually report what you say _
as opposed to the other 364 days of the year,'' said Kieran
Mahoney, the Republican consultant who helped run the unsuccessful
re-election campaign of Alfonse D'Amato of New York last year.
</P>
<P>
   And there are particular reasons to move forward in this race.
For both candidates, an announcement would remove any reluctance on
the part of donors. For Mrs. Clinton, it may finally allow her to
make the transition from first lady to candidate that so many
Democrats think she has had difficulty making. ``It would give her
a fresh start,'' said one senior New York Democrat.

TAXI SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS ARE AUDITIONED FOR BIGGER ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In an experiment aimed at deterring crimes against
taxi drivers, the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission said Tuesday
that it had installed small infrared cameras in nine cabs and
livery cars and was considering the use of such cameras throughout
the taxi industry.
</P>
<P>
   Diane McGrath-McKechnie, the chairwoman of the commission, said
in an interview that the cameras, already used routinely by cabbies
in Houston and other cities, had been in experimental use in New
York City for six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cabdrivers think it is an excellent idea,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment, first reported Tuesday in The Daily News,
incorporates video technology somewhat similar to the bank cameras
aimed at tellers. Fastened beneath the rearview mirrors inside
cabs, the infrared cameras are programmed to capture an image of
passengers as they open the door to get in, or as the fare meter is
turned on.
</P>
<P>
   The cameras can also be activated by taxi drivers during
robberies or other emergencies to provide evidence for police, Ms.
McGrath-McKechnie said. Each cab equipped with a camera would be
required to display a notice of its presence, which she said
``might provide the biggest advantage in deterrence.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the experiment was applauded Tuesday by some drivers
and industry executives, others said any attempt to make the
cameras standard taxi equipment would raise difficult questions
over passengers' rights to privacy. Some also questioned who would
pay to purchase and maintain the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``The back seat of a cab is supposed to be a sanctuary,'' said
Mike Higgins, the publisher of Taxi Talk, a magazine distributed
among New York City cabbies. ``Are they going to photograph the guy
making out with his girlfriend? And who gets the film?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McGrath-McKechnie said such fears over privacy, although not
unexpected, were misplaced. She said that the infrared cameras
being used in the experiment used digital recording systems, not
film, and that images were automatically erased unless a cabdriver
or owner elected to save them for police.
</P>
<P>
   But she said that the expense of expanding such surveillance
posed more difficult questions, and that the commission had not
decided whether the city or cab owners would be required to pay for
the cameras' use. The cameras being used in the experiment were
provided at no cost by manufacturers in Australia and Canada, but
normally cost $600 to $1,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great idea, but who is going to pay for it?'' said
Dave Pollack, chief operating officer of the League of Mutual Taxi
Owners, an organization of 3,000 drivers who own their cabs. He
said cabbies could not afford and would not accept the financial
burden.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Goldstein, a member of Pollack's group who drives one of the
nine vehicles already involved in the camera surveillance
experiment, said he felt safer with a camera above his dashboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best idea they ever had,'' Goldstein said Tuesday.
A survivor of many robberies and assaults in his cab, he said the
surveillance camera ``puts people on notice that I've got a
picture, and they won't cause any problems.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said he would continue to use a camera in his cab only if
the city paid for it. ``If the city wants good cabdrivers, it can
afford to make them safe,'' he said.

CLOSING OF BROOKHAVEN REACTOR DISMAYS SCIENTISTS, PLEASES
ENVIRONMENTALISTS  
</HEADLINE>
  (mcd) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREAT NECK, N.Y. _ Scientists at Brookhaven National Laboratory
were dismayed Tuesday at the Department of Energy's decision to
permanently close an aging nuclear reactor that has been shut since
1996, but environmentalists praised the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a bunch of very unhappy people, a lot of very
disappointed people,'' said Thomas R. Sheridan, deputy director for
operations at Brookhaven. ``We thought we had an understanding
about what the process was going to be. We feel like we got the rug
pulled out from under us.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement Tuesday by Energy Secretary Bill Richardson
came as a surprise because discussions with the department had been
going on for two years about the lab's High Flux Beam Reactor,
Sheridan said. ``The part where everybody got to comment was yet to
come,'' he said, referring to an ongoing environmental impact
study. The secretary, who had a preliminary draft of the report,
said in October that he saw no major hurdles to its reopening, but
he also requested further study.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists said they would like to see the results of the
draft study. Ever since a tritium leak was discovered in 1997 and
the reactor put on standby, the STAR Foundation, an anti-radiation
group based in East Hampton, had been working to make sure the
reactor would never be allowed to start back up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're delighted,'' said Scott Cullen, the organization's
counsel. ``I think it's a good decision for the environment on Long
Island. It will allow the people at Brookhaven to now focus on the
cleanup that is sorely needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Geri Barish, president of 1 in 9: The Long Island Breast Cancer
Action Coalition, agreed, but added that she was concerned the
draft environmental study would not be released now that a decision
had been made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they do release it,'' Ms. Barish said. ``I think the
public has a right to know. Too many secrets have been hidden from
us already. I think it's time that they face up to what is going on
and see what we can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The scientists at the laboratory described the decision as an
irreparable blow to research, describing it as the best reactor of
its kind in the northern hemisphere. But Sheridan said he did not
think the decision to permanently shut down the reactor would have
much effect on the laboratory as a whole. The reactor represented
about 5 percent of its $400 million total budget, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brookhaven will need money to close the reactor. ``This is a
pretty substantial undertaking even though it's a pretty puny
reactor,'' he said. ``There will be a couple of years of planning
of what we are going to do with it. Most important, where is that
money going to come from? That's going to cost a lot more than
starting it would have.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheridan said it was unclear whether Brookhaven would dismantle
the reactor or ``just shut it down and stand guard in front of it
for the next 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Reeside, the reactor division manager, said more staff may
be needed over the next two to three years for the cleanup. The
division has 90 permanent employees and eventually jobs will be
lost, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Funding for research of the type done at the reactor would
continue, but not necessarily on Long Island, said Michael Holland,
the director of the project management division for the Department
of Energy. New instruments would continue to be developed and some
work would be transferred to other national laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   The laboratory's mission would continue, Holland said. ``It's a
vibrant facility.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Shapiro, a scientist who had used the reactor for 30 years
to study properties of various materials, was angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you what discoveries won't be made,'' he said.
``The amount of work has been reduced. There are just not enough
facilities to support the demand for all of the users. Most of the
scientists here have been using other facilities but producing less
science. It is a national shame.''

WOMAN ON MIDTOWN STREET IS HIT BY MAN WITH A BRICK
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 27-year-old woman returning from an office errand
Tuesday afternoon was smashed in the head with a brick on a
bustling Midtown sidewalk by a man who then ran off, the police
said.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Nicole Barrett of Queens, was critically injured and
underwent brain surgery at Bellevue Hospital Center Tuesday night,
hospital officials said. The police said they had no suspects in
the attack, an apparently random act that took place in front of at
least a dozen horrified witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barrett, a temporary worker originally from Texas who was on
the last day of a job assignment on East 42nd Street, was walking
at the corner of East 42nd and Madison Avenue around 3:10 p.m. when
a man in his 30s or 40s walked up behind her, a law enforcement
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Without a word, the man brought a large gray paving stone down
on the back of her head and ran north up Madison Avenue as Ms.
Barrett slumped to the ground, witnesses told the police. The man,
who was black, of medium height and wearing a dark jacket and blue
jeans, turned west on 43rd Street and disappeared into the crowd,
witnesses said.

<P>
   It was not clear if anyone tried to stop Ms. Barrett's attacker.
A man working in a newsstand a few feet away said he heard a
commotion and ambulances but did not leave his perch to see what
was the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't look out from here,'' said the man, who would not
give his name. ``The moment we look out, people start taking
things.''

UNITED IS IN CLASS ALL ITS OWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a league designed for parity, Washington D.C. United has been
the exception.
</P>
<P>
   This is the fourth Major League Soccer championship _ and United
will make its fourth appearance in the finals when it meets the
Galaxy Sunday in Foxboro, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   United won back-to-back titles in 1996 and '97 before losing to
Chicago at the Rose Bowl last year.
</P>
<P>
   United had enough depth to cruise through the Eastern Conference
again, despite injuries and almost six weeks of excused absences
for Marco Etcheverry and Jaime Moreno because of national team
commitments with Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
   There is no parity when it comes to United and the rest of the
league. Fourteen of United's players have made international
appearances with their respective national teams in the past four
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   And when they lose a John Harkes, there is a Ben Olsen to
replace him. When they lose a Raul Diaz Arce, Roy Lassiter to the
rescue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at their team from the first year until now; they haven't
made many changes,'' said the Galaxy's Cobi Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Eight players remain from United's '96 team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It also helps when most of their players are guys that have
been to the finals and have that experience,'' Jones said. ``They
know what to expect, while most people on our team are here for the
first time.''
</P>
<P>
   United's back line consists of U.S. national team players Jeff
Agoos, Carlos Llamosa, Eddie Pope and Richie Williams.
</P>
<P>
   All you need to say about their midfield is Etcheverry, the
league's premier playmaker the past four seasons. Lassiter and
Moreno anchor things up front.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another scary fact: The heart of United's lineup could
remain intact for many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at their nucleus _ their central midfielders,
two strikers and two center-backs _ their average age is 27,''
Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid said. ``We only have one guy under the age
of 30 in our nucleus.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (United) were the ones who got the youngest, best
foreigners at the outset of the league and they've been able to
keep them with the team, as well as bring along some good, young
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of that was Bruce (Arena, former coach) having a good eye
for talent. And part of that, the league had a lot to do with.''
</P>
<P>
   When Arena left for the U.S. national team, Thomas Rongen took
over. He didn't change much.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it ain't broke, don't fix it,'' Rongen said. ``This
organization always sets their goals high and lofty. After you win
the championship in the first year, they're (championships)
realistic goals. We always talk about trying to go as far as we
can. And we've done a good job identifying young talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, United has its critics.
</P>
<P>
   New MLS commissioner Don Garber suggested that every league has
a dominant team and ones that struggle. He said, ``success breeds
success.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmid had a tough time interpreting that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how Garber can say that,'' Schmid said. ``Success
breeds success in a normal environment, but I thought this was a
league where players didn't have a say as to where they go.''
</P>
<P>
   But in MLS, top players have their share of leverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``For sure, success breeds success and, if you're a successful
team, players are going to have an interest in going there because
they want to play for that organization, with those players, with
that city, under that coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a normal environment, you can use that to continue to get
good players. But in our environment, that isn't supposed to
happen.''

IN SEEKING MANNESMANN, VODAFONE CONTEMPLATES 2-TIER STRATEGY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 2nd graf to correct trading figures)  (bl)  
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Brushing aside a legal challenge to its advisers and
the rejection of a $106.4-billion offer over the weekend, the
mobile phone giant Vodafone Airtouch PLC said Tuesday that it would
present a sweetened bid for Mannesmann AG later this week, and was
prepared to make a hostile move on the German company if that
failed.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, sensing that a hostile bid was looming, drove down
Vodafone's stock price in heavy trading more than 7 percent, to
2.7175 pounds, or $4.40. But Mannesmann's shares soared intraday to
217.5 euros _ 14.5 euros above Vodafone's previous offering price _
before falling back to end the day's trading in Frankfurt at 207.65
euros, or $214.46.
</P>
<P>
   The market behavior of the two stocks presented Vodafone chief
executive Christopher Gent with what analysts regarded as a tricky
choice. A takeover of Mannesmann would make Vodafone _ already the
global wireless leader _ one of the world's biggest
telecommunications companies with dominance in Europe's
fast-growing wireless market and powerful positions in the United
States and the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
   But the cost could make that sort of move perilous, since a
slide in Vodafone's stock price would render a hostile bid more
expensive and would risk alienating its own investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weaker Vodafone Airtouch shares are, the deeper it will
have to dig and the less attractive the deal will look to its
existing shareholders,'' said Nigel Hawkins, an analyst with the
brokerage firm Williams de Broe. ``It's a desperately difficult
decision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Wight, an analyst with Commerzbank in London, said a
hostile bid was ``not going to be very pretty in the near term, but
the strategic rationale for doing it is so strong that it's the
price they may feel they have to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a fear that Vodafone will have to pay a heavy
premium,'' said John Jensen of Salomon Smith Barney. ``If their bid
doesn't succeed, it'll be negative, and if it does and it's too
expensive, that will be negative, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone and Mannesmann have been partners for years in Germany,
Italy and France. But when the German company reached an agreement
to acquire Orange PLC, Britain No. 3 wireless operator, last month,
it became a competitor on Vodafone's home territory. Gent
complained at a news conference Tuesday that Mannesmann had not
consulted him about that deal.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann's $33 billion purchase of Orange led to speculation
that a hostile bid by Vodafone was imminent, particularly after
Mannesmann rejected the $106.4 billion proposal made Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   As the battle intensified, Mannesmann sought a High Court
injunction preventing Vodafone's main advisers, the Wall Street
powerhouse Goldman, Sachs, the leading investment banker in Europe,
from advising it. Goldman's objections to an injunction are to be
heard Thursday and it has voluntarily suspended its service until
then.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Tuesday, Gent argued that a combination of
Vodafone and Mannesmann had ``compelling logic'' because it would
mean control of Europe's biggest wireless markets with 30 million
customers and would create savings of $800 million in 2003 and $970
million in 2004.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While Vodafone's initial bid was made directly to Mannesmann
chief executive Klaus Esser, Gent said a new bid would be presented
to Mannesmann's supervisory board Friday.
</P>
<P>
   German supervisory boards include labor representatives,
managers and outside directors, and they set the broad outlines of
company policy. Vodafone executives indicated that they believed an
approach to Mannesmann's supervisory board might elicit a more
sympathetic response than Esser's outright rejection of the earlier
offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would hope that the supervisory board sees the logic of
putting the businesses together,'' Peter Bamford, chief executive
of Vodafone's British division, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Arun Sarin, chief executive of Vodafone's U.S., Asia and Pacific
division, said in an interview that ``we would very much like for
this to be a friendly transaction,'' adding, ``There is no need for
this to be hostile.''
</P>
<P>
   If the approach to the supervisory board failed, Gent told
reporters, ``We're prepared, if necessary, to proceed with an
unsolicited bid.''
</P>
<P>
   There has never been a successful hostile takeover in Germany,
and Mannesmann is protected by a company regulation that no
shareholder can control more than 5 percent of voting rights.
</P>
<P>
   Gent said he would canvass his company's shareholders over the
next two days before deciding at a Vodafone board meeting on
Thursday how much to bid.
</P>
<P>
   The offer made Sunday valued Mannesmann at 203 euros a share, or
$209.65 at current rates, and offered 43.7 Vodafone shares for each
Mannesmann share. Analysts now forecast that Vodafone's revised
offer will have to be in the region of 240 euros, or $247.87, a
share to interest Mannesmann stockholders. That would value
Mannesmann in the region of $130 billion, making an offer the
largest hostile bid ever.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in Mannesmann's share price has partly reflected
speculation that other companies might join with Vodafone to make a
bid, possibly Bell Atlantic Corp., a Vodafone partner in the United
States. But Bell Atlantic chief executive Ivan Seidenberg said
Tuesday that his company was not interested.
</P>
<P>
   Gent disclosed his intentions Tuesday as Vodafone announced a
113 percent gain in first-half earnings, to $1.42 billion. The
results exclude the costs of Vodafone's merger in January with
Airtouch of San Francisco.

USC'S MORTON PROMISES NO TRASH TALK, JUST A WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Chad Morton wore something in cardinal and gold
when he took a stroll in the sand at Playa del Rey recently, and a
trash collector recognized him as a USC football player, all
5-foot-8, 185 pounds of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You better beat them this year!'' shouted the man with the
pointed stick and the garbage bag.
</P>
<P>
   He was talking trash to the right Trojan.
</P>
<P>
   Morton is on record guaranteeing that USC will beat ``them'' _
UCLA _ Saturday at the Coliseum. The senior tailback has been
guaranteeing it since August.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sickening,'' Morton told a Sports Illustrated writer back
then, referring to the Bruins' eight-year winning streak against
USC. ``But I guarantee this year we are not going to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Morton repeated the prediction when he sat before dozens of
reporters at the Pac-10 media day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches don't like us to talk like that, but I think that
what this team needs is a little confidence,'' he said then.
</P>
<P>
   Given how much has transpired in the three months since then _
little of it inspiring confidence _ Morton could be forgiven if he
crawled back off that limb this week and joined the majority of
prognosticators in saying the game between a couple of inconsistent
teams is impossible to forecast.
</P>
<P>
   But he hasn't backed off one inch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sticking to it,'' Morton said Tuesday afternoon in
Heritage Hall. ``I'm still guaranteeing a win, even though our
season hasn't gone the way we'd have liked.''
</P>
<P>
   The guarantee is ear-catching for two reasons.
</P>
<P>
   First, Morton is not the brash sort. The conversation with the
sanitation worker is the closest he'll ever come to trash talking.
</P>
<P>
   Morton says he does not engage in verbal smack on the field. As
22-year-olds go, he's pretty polite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I help people up,'' he said. ``People help me up.''
</P>
<P>
   Second, considering the temptation for athletes to draw
attention to themselves with flimsy guarantees _ after all, they
never have to pay off _ such predictions are surprisingly rare.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Namath guaranteed a Jets victory in the 1969 Super Bowl. Pat
Riley guaranteed a Lakers championship repeat in 1988. Muhammad Ali
guaranteed any number of wins. Namath's and Riley's guarantees came
true, and Ali's usually did.
</P>
<P>
   Evander Holyfield guaranteed a third-round knockout the first
time he fought Lennox Lewis. Forced to go the distance in a lucky
draw, Holyfield fell into the same category as George Bush, whose
guarantee was no new taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The only guarantee anybody can remember in the USC-UCLA series
happened in 1984. Fired up by the Trojans' upset victory over
top-ranked Washington the week before, quarterback Tim Green
blurted out to writers, ``We're going to whup the Bruins!''
</P>
<P>
   After the Bruins won 29-10, one of them remarked, ``That was the
best whuppin' we've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   Morton recognizes he'll be the butt of jokes, as Green was, if
USC loses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to back it up, or we'll look like complete idiots,''
he said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   We will or I will?
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't (win), I'll take the fall for everybody,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Morton said he considered the possibilities before he spoke
up last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was well thought out, definitely,'' he said. ``It wasn't
just something I thought would be nice to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents tell me, `Don't do stuff to get them (the Bruins)
all fired up and make 'em play even better than they are,''' he
said. ``But I'm not trying to put their players or coaches down,
I'm just trying to build up our team. ... I think it has got
everybody going a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Will the pressure Saturday be on USC's players, who want to be
the ones to end the streak, or on UCLA's, who don't want to be the
ones to let it end? Bruins coach Bob Toledo said Monday the
pressure is on the Trojans. Trojans coach Paul Hackett admitted
Tuesday that's probably true.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been talking about it for a year,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Morton, for one, said he's having trouble sleeping. Tenth on
USC's all-time rushing list with 2,284 yards, including a game-high
120 against UCLA in 1998, he should have a big game Saturday
against the Pac-10's weakest rushing defense.
</P>
<P>
   If he doesn't, or if his teammates let him down, his guarantee
goes on the trash heap of history.

TALKS IN CUBA PROVIDE OUTLET FOR DISSIDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS to insert new 9th thru 12th grafs, bgng At the same. In 2nd

 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA _ The business card of Elizardo Sanchez, a leading
dissident here, has a curious caveat next to his phone number: ``if
it works.''
</P>
<P>
   It currently does, and then some. At his home, where the living
room is arrayed with pictures of him with the likes of Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass., and the Czech president, Vaclav Havel, Sanchez
has been contacted by at least nine of the delegations that came to
Havana to attend a summit meeting of Latin American countries and
Spain and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   He is not alone. At least 14 other Cuban human rights advocates
and relatives of political prisoners have held meetings with
visiting heads of state and other dignitaries, including the
Spanish prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar, and the Mexican foreign
minister, Rosario Green.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban participants in these meetings said discussions included
issues like multiparty democracy, open markets, freedom of
expression and _ they pointedly added _ an end to the U.S. embargo
against Cuba. They said the meetings were held at the request of
the various delegations, and passed without incident or impediment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never before have we seen so many dignitaries coming to our
country to meet with dissidents and opponents of the government,''
Sanchez said, moments before he was whisked off in a van to meet
with a delegation from Brazil. ``This is a great acknowledgement of
a sector of our country, whose government said for many years we
did not exist or were nonpersons.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings come one week after Cuban officials not only
criticized the dissidents for wanting to hold a parallel meeting,
but detained several dozen of them for hours, and kept another 15
under arrest on suspicion of planning acts of sabotage to disrupt
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to allow Sanchez and others to meet with the
foreign dignitaries appeared to be a calculated move by the
government to allow some openness and to avoid public conflicts
that would mar the country's moment in the spotlight as host to a
meeting of presidents, prime ministers and other officials from 21
Latin American nations, Spain and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials do not view the dissidents as a monolithic
group, which may also explain whey they have not interfered with
the meetings. They distinguish between those like Sanchez _ who is
seen as a thoughtful, if ideologically opposed, figure _ and others
who are viewed as puppets of the exile community, dedicated to
destabilizing the regime. They insist the groups do not present a
real challenge or an alternative to the government.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, President Fidel Castro said he would have
preferred that the dignitaries spend more time talking to ordinary
Cubans, who he said were not in agreement with the dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This summit has been full of virtual realities,'' he said
after the summit ended Tuesday night. ``Nobody is talking about the
real objective of the summit.''
</P>
<P>
   But in closing remarks earlier in the evening, several heads of
state reiterated the need for greater openness in Cuba.
``Sovereignty also needs democracy,'' said President Ernesto
Zedillo of Mexico. ``There can be no sovereign nation without free
men and women, men and women who can exercise their essential
freedoms. Freedom to think and give their opinions, freedom to
dissent, freedom to chose.''
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo's remarks came days after his foreign minister, Ms.
Green, met with Sanchez.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Green said in a prepared statement that her meeting with
Sanchez did not constitute a change in Mexico's policy against
intervening in the affairs of other nations. Sanchez said that the
Mexican government can nevertheless play a helpful role in Cuba, as
it has in helping to resolve the regional conflicts in Central
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though there is no civil war in Cuba, there is still a
strong confrontation between Washington and Havana,'' he said.
``Due to the good relations Mexico has with both countries, it
could make a bigger contribution to normalizing relations between
Havana and the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   While not explicitly condemning the Cuban government, several of
the dignitaries who met with the dissidents expressed carefully
worded support for their concerns. Aznar, the Spanish prime
minister, said he met with the dissidents because he was not a
``part-time democrat'' and that he always wanted to make as many
contacts as possible wherever he traveled.
</P>
<P>
   Even before this week's meetings, four jailed dissidents
received a letter of solidarity signed by 43 human rights advocates
and political leaders from Eastern Europe, including Havel; former
President Lech Walesa of Poland, and Yelena Bonner, the widow of
the Russian dissident Andrei Sakharov. The letter invoked the
memory of Jose Marti, the nationalist leader who is still revered
in Cuba for his fight against Spanish rule.
</P>
<P>
   In his opening remarks Tuesday morning, Castro ignored the
dissidents, and declared that he remains committed to the path he
chose decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke of the first such meeting in Guadalajara, Mexico, eight
years ago, when Cuba was widely urged to shed its communist system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advice rained down from everywhere,'' he said. ``But we
thought of another way and decided to struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials now say that after several harsh years of a
subsistence economy following the end of support from the former
Soviet Union, the economy is growing. Tourism has contributed
greatly, and the country is getting better credit terms, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting has given the government a chance to project an
image of its society different from the one offered by Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Modest crowds turned out to greet King Juan Carlos of Spain as
he toured the restoration of elegant buildings in Old Havana. The
visitors also went to inaugural ceremonies at the new Latin
American School of Medical Science, where 1,929 students from
Central and South America are studying medicine. Enrollment is
expected to reach 8,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   But the highlight of the week has already come for Hector
Palacios, a dissident who founded the Democratic Solidarity Party,
an act that led to a prison term. Like Sanchez, he said his morale
was improved by the visits with the foreign dignitaries. Yet he was
also realistic about the lasting effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we won a lot in expectations and hope,'' he said.
``Hope that we will become stronger. Hope that we will have other
doors to knock on. Hope that other eyes will look out for us. But I
do not have hope that the government will change or make a gesture
of flexibility soon.''

ANGELS HOPE TO NAME MANAGER THIS WEEK

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Anaheim Angels will hire a manager in the next couple of
days. At least that's what Bill Stoneman hopes to do.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels will hire a scouting director to replace Bob Fontaine
shortly thereafter. At least that's what Stoneman hopes to do.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels will talk to pitcher Chuck Finley about re-signing
with the team. At least that's what Stoneman hopes to do.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a hectic 16 days since Stoneman took over as the
club's general manager Nov. 1. But he knew that coming in.
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman has interviewed seven managerial candidates _ Bob
Boone, Chris Chambliss, Ken Macha, Hal McRae, Joe Maddon, Mike
Scioscia and Joel Skinner _ and he expects to name one of those by
the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my intent,'' Stoneman said. ``(Deciding on a manager)
has been much more time consuming than I thought. It's an in-depth
thing because it's a key decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman wouldn't say that he's narrowed the list, only that ``I
think I've zeroed in on the direction we want to go. But I'm not
there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman's top priority in a manager is ``somebody who is going
to command respect of the players. You win respect, you don't ask
for it. You obtain it by the way you conduct yourself and the
respect you give to other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman will then move forward on hiring a scouting director,
but in the meantime continues to further the risk of losing Finley.
Finley is meeting with other teams, with the Cleveland Indians
seeming to have the best shot at getting him.
</P>
<P>
   Finley has told friends that he has been disappointed by the
Angels' apparent disinterest. Stoneman says it's just a matter of
getting together and talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a priority since I first walked through the door to
get together with him and sit down and discuss things,'' Stoneman
said. ``I'm not blindly going to make a decision without first
having an exchange with him. It's something Chuck has known I've
wanted to do for a while, but we haven't been able to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to his agent (Tuesday). I hope we can get together
and talk in the new future.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman added it's been frustrating trying to get something set
up with Finley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried to make time for everything,'' he said.

EDITORIAL: A COSTLY DEAL ON U.N. DUES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Nov. 17:
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton paid a regrettably high price to win the House
Republican leadership's assent to give almost $1 billion in back
American dues to the United Nations. Last weekend, White House
bargainers agreed to new statutory language restricting
international family planning assistance that the administration
had firmly and rightly resisted in the past. Understandably,
advocates for women's health and reproductive choice, even
including Vice President Gore, bemoaned that damaging concession
and questioned its necessity.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, House approval of the U.N. arrears payments,
assuming that final details of the agreement can be worked out and
sold to the Republican rank and file, will be a significant
achievement. Failure to pay these assessments had undermined the
United Nations' finances, weakened American influence there and put
Washington's voting rights in the General Assembly at risk. The
United States cannot exercise global leadership unless it honors
its financial obligations. Nor can Washington reasonably expect
other countries to consider congressional demands for lower
American dues assessments in the future until it pays off most of
the dues it already owes.
</P>
<P>
   To get the U.N. money approved, the White House compromised on
an important issue of principle, and may have encouraged radical
anti-abortion crusaders to expand their assault on abortion rights.
Under the newly agreed language, foreign family planning
organizations that spend their own money to provide abortions or
lobby for less harsh abortion laws will now be legally ineligible
for American assistance.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the compromise, the administration won the right to
waive this restriction if it chooses. But even with the waiver, no
more than $15 million in American assistance can be given to
organizations engaged in abortion services or lobbying. That is
about the amount such groups got last year. Another part of the
deal stipulates that if the administration exercises the waiver the
$385 million budgeted for aid to women's health groups will be
reduced by $12.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The practical effect of these restrictions is likely to be
small, at least for as long as the Clinton administration is in
office and invokes the waiver provision. But there is no disguising
the political victory it hands the anti-abortion crusaders in the
House who were willing to hold American foreign policy to their
ideological agenda. Although part of only a one-year spending bill,
the language is likely to reappear in future years unless a
majority of House members vote to exclude it.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans, including committed abortion foes like Sen.
Jesse Helms, behaved more responsibly than their House colleagues
on this issue. But the House obstructionists held firm, faced down
the White House and walked away with a disturbingly large share of
what they wanted.

WHERE HAS TROJAN TRADITION GONE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who believes that change is good is obviously not a
Trojan football fan.
</P>
<P>
   USC supporters have gone through enough change the last two
decades to last several millenniums, and it's been a slow,
anguished descent, too, turning ``Fight On'' into more of a
question than a proclamation.
</P>
<P>
   Two periods of probation. Four head coaches, three fired. Five
Rose Bowl berths in 20 seasons after 10 the previous 14. Bowl-less
three of the last four seasons. Five losses or more in seven of the
last nine seasons. A 13-game winless streak against Notre Dame, and
the current eight-game losing streak against UCLA that is on the
line Saturday at the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   But as miserable as that accounting may be, something else
around the corner may be even worse: The Trojan faithful seems to
have lost its faith.
</P>
<P>
   After so many years of immense pride, pride that occasionally
drifted toward arrogance, USC fans now appear indifferent or
defeatists. Only 57,493 came out for the Stanford game, and just
53,382 for homecoming versus Arizona State, the smallest homecoming
crowd since 1993, when the opponent was Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   At the Stanford and Arizona State games at the Coliseum this
season, the crowd vibe was as interesting as anything on the field.
The body language of the fans was all trepidation and gloom --
hands in pocket, arms across chest, eyes more wary than hopeful.
Emotional sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   Trojan fans now even lack the energy to jeer anymore, like they
did in 1986 and 1994, when they booed Ted Tollner and Rob Johnson
off the Coliseum field. USC fans will muster the courage to show up
Saturday, but many will leave their optimism at home. Or at least
in the car.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Hackett only has nice things to say about the fans,
thanking them Tuesday for hanging in with a team that can't go the
distance. ``I'd like to find a way to win and let people who
suffered through this year have a chance to enjoy it.'' he said.
``Our fans have been great.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't mean there aren't people out there yelling (at
me). The day I was hired, half the people probably thought I was
the wrong choice. There will always be some people who, when you
don't have (a good year), will say you're headed down the wrong
road.''
</P>
<P>
   Or the same road. That may be the tombstone for USC football.
The malaise outlasted the fans.
</P>
<P>
   What fans tend to overlook at times like this is that the losses
can't possibly affect them more than the players. To know the
difference, one only has to look at the face of senior safety David
Gibson 48 games played, 230 tackles, three positions in his USC
career to date when he says he won't consider his USC career a
success if the Trojans don't win Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The extra spoonful of fan indignation just makes the players
feel worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (fans) expect us to win. They expect Pac-10
championships, and they're disappointed when they come up and talk
to me,'' said senior safety David Gibson. ``But I'm living this
season. It's my life.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Our fans are) lukewarm. Like a lot of fans in L.A., they're
front-runners. When USC is doing well, they'll be there. When we're
not, they're not, and they become even more derogatory.''
</P>
<P>
   If the players take the field knowing the fans expect the worse
(ital) and (end) will talk smack afterward, then who are they
playing for, besides themselves?
</P>
<P>
   This has always been what separates college football from pro
football. College football has alums who cut through generations,
that once-a-Trojan-always-a-Trojan stuff. Sure, coaches are hired
and fired, but most players can remember their college days fondly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the team would play a lot better if we had more
support,'' said Gibson. ``If they expect this to be a great team,
it's got to go both ways. It (gives) so much energy to a team to
have a packed house and feel the vibe of a home game.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that a large part of USC's heritage is already musty Long
Beach Poly's Kareem Kelly was nine the last time USC beat UCLA it
will be doubly dangerous if fans take a walk.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Smith got fired for saying ``traditions'' aren't relevant.
John Robinson was rehired because he said they are. Either way,
nothing changed. Paul Hackett may leave some cold with his
coaching, but at least he's a realist.
</P>
<P>
   When USC goes calling on recruits these days, they're shown the
four Heisman trophies in Heritage Hall, but the reminiscing ends
there. The pitch isn't ``be the next Marcus Allen.'' It's ``be next
year's starting tailback.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had two classes where our top recruit has played and had
a dramatic effect (Carson Palmer last year, Kareem Kelly this
year),'' said Hackett. ``That tells recruits that if you come, you
have a chance to play right away. We continue to make that promise,
because our program is at the point where we're building and we
need people who are not afraid of playing right away.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what led Banning running back Chris Howard to already
commit to USC. ``I know about the tradition,'' he said, ``but what
really attracted me was the chance to come in and start right
away.''
</P>
<P>
   But how many more Howards will commit if the fans stay home or,
worse, keep talking trash?
</P>
<P>
   USC will host a large handful of recruits Saturday as part of
their official visit. But Hackett knows UCLA is recruiting the same
kids, and the past and future for both programs will be on display.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some kids who say they want to go to a school that
goes to a Rose Bowl or Cotton Bowl or BCS Bowl every year,'' said
Hackett. ``And some kids will look at both teams and say `hey,
these teams have not had (a great year).'
</P>
<P>
   ``(The UCLA) game is important for a lot of reasons, but let's
face it. For eight years, we've come up on the short end, and I
don't know if there's anything more important right now than just
breaking the streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight's enough. We don't need anymore. It's time to turn it
around.'' For themselves, if not the fans.

TRIAL ON 1996 VALUJET CRASH OPENS IN MIAMI 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs 1st and 3rd grafs to delete word `explosive`) 
 (nk) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ One thing became clear Tuesday, as federal prosecutors
and defense lawyers made opening statements in a criminal trial
that accuses a maintenance company and two employees of shoddy work
and an ensuing cover-up in the handling of oxygen generators
implicated in the crash of Valujet Flight 592.
</P>
<P>
   No matter whom the jury ultimately believes, the 110 people who
departed Miami International Airport on that flight of May 11,
1996, were doomed as they took their seats.
</P>
<P>
   Either they died from criminal negligence, in the handling and
packaging of the oxygen generators, as prosecutors claimed, or they
died from problems with the plane itself, a 27-year-old aircraft
with faulty mechanics and wiring that should never have been in the
sky in the first place, as defense lawyers argued.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 592 crashed into the Florida Everglades just after
takeoff, killing all aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors say Sabretech, a now-bankrupt aircraft
maintenance company, and two employees _ a former head mechanic and
a subcontractor doing mechanic work _ disregarded safety to rush
through their work on the oxygen generators, which prosecutors said
caught fire in a cargo hold and caused the plane to crash. The
company and the two workers are charged with causing the transport
of hazardous materials, falsifying documents and conspiring to lie
to federal investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Caroline Heck Miller said in her opening
statement that the generators, which provide emergency oxygen when
planes lose cabin pressure, were loaded into the plane's cargo hold
for transport to Atlanta without being fitted with safety caps.
</P>
<P>
   The missing caps were sacrificed for expediency, prosecutors
will try to prove.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emphasis was on getting the paperwork done, as opposed to
the task,'' Ms. Heck Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   But defense lawyers described a much different company, one in
which no one intentionally neglected safety procedures with intent
to cause a crash. But even they conceded that the maintenance
workers did not know how to handle the generators.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one at Sabretech intended for that plane to crash,'' said
Martin Raskin, a lawyer for Sabretech, which did maintenance for
Valujet.
</P>
<P>
   But Raskin did not paint a safety-inspiring picture of the
handling of the generators. While maintenance workers had neglected
to put the safety caps on the generators, they carefully packaged
them in cardboard boxes and wrapped them with bubble wrap, he said
in his opening statement.
</P>
<P>
   The generators, when triggered, can reach temperatures of 400 to
500 degrees, according to crash investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The generators were not labeled as hazardous, Raskin said. ``A
bottle of bleach,'' he said, ``will tell you more about its
dangers.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is the ensuing cover-up, federal prosecutors said, that
proves the mechanics knew they were putting people at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the caps were not installed, Eugene Florence, a
mechanic for Sabretech, signed a maintenance record saying they had
been. He is on trial here, along with his supervisor, Daniel
Gonzalez, the head mechanic and chief of hangar operations.
</P>
<P>
   A third Sabretech employee, Mauro Valenzuela, was also charged,
but is a fugitive from justice.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, the defendants could be imprisoned for up to 55
years and fined more than $2 million. Sabretech, which went out of
business after the crash, could be fined up to $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company has also been charged in state court with
third-degree murder and manslaughter, although no individuals are
named.
</P>
<P>
   Though federal investigators have pointed to the generators as
the likely cause of the crash, Raskin pointed to the plane itself,
a DC-9 with numerous mechanical and electrical problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plane that crashed was an old plane, with old wiring,''
Raskin said. Neither the plane's auto pilot nor its intercom
worked. Flight attendants had to use a bullhorn to make
announcements to passengers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Valujet, a discount airline based in Atlanta, eventually merged
with Airtran.

NORTHRIDGE EXPECTED MORE FROM LINEBACKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was once thought to be the deepest position on
the Cal State Northridge football team: linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   But four days before the Matadors' season finale, not one
Matadors linebacker is among the team's top three defenders in
tackling. Middle linebacker Cos Abercrombie leads the unit with 44
tackles, followed by Jack Heaslet, who has 43.
</P>
<P>
   Abercrombie and Heaslet are fifth and sixth, respectively, on
the team in that category.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've struggled in a sense this year,'' linebackers coach
Terrance Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson cites three reasons why linebackers like Abercrombie, a
sophomore, and Heaslet, a senior, haven't been able to dominate the
Matadors' tackling statistics.
</P>
<P>
   First, he said, mobile defensive linemen like Shawnbay Jones (63
tackles), Brennen Swanson (60) and Erik Gardner (24) are able to
make stops, instead of simply holding the ballcarrier and waiting
for a linebacker to help.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Johnson was the defensive line coach in the spring. He
switched to the linebackers, the position he played in college at
Colorado, late in the summer after head coach Ron Ponciano was
fired and the staff changed.
</P>
<P>
   Third, Abercrombie simply hasn't been the dominant player
Johnson anticipated in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got the capability,'' Johnson said of Abercrombie. ``He's
got to let his ability take over.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Blanton, a sophomore, has played well in the season's
latter half. Johnson looks forward to 2000 with Abercrombie and
Blanton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the guys I'm carrying into next season as my
starters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping down: Cliff Hysell, the dean of the Big Sky head
coaches, announced his resignation at Montana State on Sunday.
Hysell, 57, has been at MSU for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   The Bobcats were projected as one of the top four teams in the
conference. But they enter Saturday's game at rival Montana just
3-7 overall, 1-6 in the Big Sky.
</P>
<P>
   Hysell cited health concerns as his primary reason for
resigning. He's scheduled to undergo two surgeries on his spine and
he'll require two months of rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   Rivalry weekend: Several CSUN players have mentioned Sacramento
State as the team's rival in the Big Sky. But those thoughts may be
pushed aside when Northern Arizona (7-3, 5-2) comes to North Campus
Stadium on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Lumberjacks beat CSUN 68-7 in 1995 _ at the time it was the
worst loss in school history.
</P>
<P>
   But the Matadors have won the past two games, including 41-10
last year at Flagstaff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been the team that has brought out the most in us,''
CSUN interim head coach Jeff Kearin said. ``NAU is that benchmark
(for us). They are one of the more solid programs in I-AA
football.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe's back: Freshman receiver Joe Gilliam, who was suspended
from the team two weeks ago, returned to practice Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gilliam, who suffered a concussion against Weber State on Oct.
30, two days before he was suspended, may or may not play this
week, Kearin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a class-attendance issue,'' Kearin said. ``(Gilliam)'s
abided by the rules. I have no intention of doing anything with the
(starting) lineup.''

<P>
   KINGS POINT, N.Y. _ The dining hall roof leaks. Decrepit
plumbing makes the water undrinkable in some buildings. The
temperature in the barracks fluctuates with the whims of clogged
radiators.
</P>
<P>
   ``This school is falling apart,'' says Jason Hochevar, a
midshipman in his last year at the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy.
But don't get him wrong; Hochevar is otherwise very proud of the
academy, an 82-acre training ground on Long Island's north shore
for the country's commercial and military mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the midshipmen complain too loudly. The military
culture here _ students dress in stark black uniforms, salutes
abound, a formal procession precedes the march into lunch _ frowns
on belly-aching. Hochevar's assessment came only after some
prodding. But he and other classmates gathered at a dining table
with a base official close by quickly emphasized the positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``You make do with what you have, like on a ship,'' said Kirsten
Preisch, a senior midshipman (the term also applies to the school's
95 women).
</P>
<P>
   ``Acta non verba'' _ deeds, not words _ is the school's motto
but ``make do'' could serve just as well for a place that has
withstood obscurity, the declining prominence of the United States
in global shipping and whacks from federal bean counters.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago a commission headed by Vice President Al Gore to
streamline the government proposed cutting the academy's funding in
half and allowing it to charge tuition, something never done here
or at the four other service academies, for the Coast Guard, Air
Force, Army and Navy. Free tuition is a powerful recruitment tool,
so supporters killed the idea through heavy lobbying by parents and
alumni, such as the late Lane Kirkland, the labor leader.
</P>
<P>
   But since then, federal money for the academy has remained
relatively flat, despite rising operating costs and sorely needed
maintenance to shore up buildings constructed during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   People affiliated with the school by turns sound defensive and
prideful of its underdog status. That is perhaps because the
school's mission _ to prepare people to work in the maritime
industry, both ashore and afloat _ seems unexciting when compared
with those of the larger, better-funded, more glamorous service
academies, such as West Point or Annapolis. ``When was the last
time you saw a movie about the Merchant Marine?'' is how Martin
Skrocki, the public information officer at Kings Point, put it.
</P>
<P>
   But the school, with an enrollment this fall of 929, basks in
its occasional brushes with fame. Two weeks ago, when EgyptAir
Flight 990 fell out of the sky into the ocean off Massachusetts, it
was the Kingspointer _ a surplus Navy ship that serves as the
academy's chief training vessel _ that was first on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   It had been on a training run from Kings Point to Boston with 17
students and happened to be the closest to the site of the crash,
which killed 217 people. The midshipmen plucked sections of the
aircraft and body parts out of the water in the dead of night, an
hour before the Coast Guard arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Academy officials have prohibited midshipmen from discussing the
crash in detail pending the completion of the investigation by the
National Transportation Safety Board, which like the academy, is
under the Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly was a sobering experience,'' said Ben Lyons, a
midshipman and navigation officer on the Kingspointer, a 224-foot
former Navy intelligence ship. ``I learned there are some things
you have to do and that is what needed to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   The academy traces its founding to the sinking of the Morro
Castle in 1934 off Asbury Park, N.J., which claimed 134 lives. The
disaster was attributed in part to the crew's inability to put out
a devastating fire, raising concern about the lack of formal
training for mariners.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not until 1943 that the government formally
established the academy, on grounds that once belonged to Walter
Chrysler, the automotive tycoon. His white, Greek Revival mansion
now serves as the administration building, a jewel among the more
utilitarian sandstone structures built over 18 months during World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   In the postwar years, the emphasis of instruction was more on
``ship driving'' and mechanics, says Capt. Robert L. Safarik, a
1961 graduate who returned as an instructor in 1983 and is now
chief of staff. ``We were very hands on; it was almost like a trade
school,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A grad could take apart a pump and put it back together
again,'' Safarik said, his hands fluttering, suggesting he still
knows how. ``They still can, but it's more technological now. It is
a much tougher school academically.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the other service academies, candidates must meet rigorous
scholastic and physical requirements, receive a nomination from a
member of Congress and fulfill obligations after graduating. In the
case of Kings Point, graduates must work five years in the maritime
industry or on active duty in the armed forces and serve eight
years in the reserve forces of any branch of the military.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike at the other service academies, the midshipmen at the
Merchant Marine Academy must also serve 300 days at sea during
their four years, either on civilian or military vessels. That
means students, who graduate with a bachelor of science degree,
effectively squeeze four years of classes into three.
</P>
<P>
   About a fifth of the graduates go on to active duty in the
military, usually to the Navy as ensigns. But over time, as the
number of deep-channel commercial vessels under the United States
flag has dropped to 350 last year from 2,200 after the war, the
academy has evolved so now almost equal numbers of graduates go to
work on ships as stay ashore as engineers and managers at
maritime-related firms.

 KINGS POINT, N.Y.: maritime-related firms. 
  In fact, the newest major, introduced last year, is already the
most popular: ``Logistics and Intermodal Transport,'' which
essentially means designing and improving how goods like wood are
shipped, turned into chairs and delivered to living rooms.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mariners from the old days may not recognize the classes, but
the mores and routines generally have remained the same.
</P>
<P>
   Reveille at dawn. Muster in the afternoon. Lunch formation.
``Sir, yes, sir.'' All the regimentation is still there and so are
many of the traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Graduates, upon learning they have successfully passed all
required exams, still dash to ring the brass bell that hangs in
front of the administration building, the same one they may have
polished with a toothbrush for some plebian indiscretion like
chewing gum while in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Many students initially scoff at all the rules and order; on a
recent day a plebe even had the underwear in his drawer perfectly
folded and arranged in neat rows.
</P>
<P>
   But they come to see the regimentation as integral to life at
sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``At sea, you don't do your job, people will die,'' explained
Hochevar, as a plebe, Kevin Sparks of Valdosta, Ga., stood at
attention in his spare, cinder-block room wearing slightly scuffed
shoes. ``No excuse for that, Sparks,'' Hochevar said, delaying a
decision on punishment until his visitors left the room.
</P>
<P>
   But all the rules make for an education highly prized in the
maritime industry, as well as an alternate route around the other
service academies to an officer's commission in the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many unique aspects to the school and
opportunities upon graduation that you could write your ticket,''
said Zachary Mathews, a senior from Winfield, Kan., who plans to
fly for the Coast Guard when he leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Rear Adm. Joseph D. Stewart, the school's superintendent for
just over a year, said he has tried to balance the traditional
mission of the school with changing demand from the marketplace,
while, of course, hunting for ways to provide badly needed
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Funding lately has not been as precarious but still falls short
of needs. In July, Rep. Gary L. Ackerman, the Democrat whose
district includes the school, won a $2 million increase in the
school's budget, its highest in several years and one that brought
financing up to $34 million.
</P>
<P>
   Clyde J. Hart, who heads the U.S. Maritime Administration, which
oversees the school for the Transportation Department, said there
are no plans to withhold funding or close the school, which would
mean mariners would be trained solely at the handful of
state-sponsored schools, several of which have endured their own
troubles. The State University of New York Maritime College in the
Bronx, for example, is preparing new courses and other changes to
try to increase enrollment, which has dipped 30 percent, to 816
last year, since its peak in the early 1980's, state officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Alumni of the Merchant Marine Academy continue to support the
school passionately; the alumni association and its foundation
donated an eight-acre parcel to the school in 1979 and it
coordinates regular fund-raisers that generate $300,000 to $400,000
annually, primarily for extracurricular activities and amenities
not financed by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart has big plans for the school. He wants more majors (the
school now offers seven), more diversity, and, of course, more
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to revamp the barracks, a better athletic facility, a
student union and rec center,'' Stewart said. ``But at the same
time none of our needs are show-stoppers. Everything we are
required to do we can do.''

SUNY RAISES ITS SALARY LIMIT FOR A CHANCELLOR TO $350,000 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The State University of New York could pay its next chancellor
as much as $350,000 under a resolution its trustees passed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   SUNY's current chancellor, John Ryan, who has announced his
intention to step down by the end of the year, earns $250,000 a
year. But chief executives at large public universities and
university systems in California, Florida, Georgia and other states
are paid more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big job. We're a huge enterprise,'' Thomas Egan, SUNY's
chairman, said Tuesday, adding that with more than 350,000
students, SUNY is the largest university system in the country.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its search to replace Ryan, SUNY officials studied
what other universities pay. SUNY officials said the chancellor of
the California state system is paid $436,000, the chancellor of the
University of Georgia system $324,000, and the chancellor of the
University of Florida system $333,000.
</P>
<P>
   The trustees approved a new salary range of $275,000 to
$350,000. The raise must be submitted to the state Legislature and
to the state budget division. It is also subject to a 60-day
comment period.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan will not receive a raise, but the trustees voted to make
him emeritus chancellor when he retires and to keep him on as a
consultant to be paid on a per diem basis.
</P>
<P>
   The board raised Ryan's salary to $250,000 from $172,400 in
October 1997, and set the salary range for the position at $220,000
to $290,000.
</P>
<P>
   At $250,000, the salary was already among the highest paid to
any state official, and at $350,000, it would be far more than the
$179,000 paid to the governor or the $195,000 paid to New York
City's mayor.
</P>
<P>
   William Scheuerman, president of SUNY's faculty union, said he
was less troubled by the new raise than by the board's failure to
provide enough money for the campuses in the budget for the current
academic year that it approved Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new budget, about half of SUNY's state-operated
campuses will not receive large enough increases in their operating
budgets to cover the salary increases for faculty and staff that
were approved under the most recent union agreement. That agreement
called for a 12.5 percent raise spread over four years, through
July 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased that we're taking care of the chancellor,''
Scheuerman said. ``But I'd like to see us take care of the students
and make sure that they have enough faculty to teach them.''
</P>
<P>
   He said SUNY officials were denying that any staff reductions
would be needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``SUNY officials are saying no, no, no, but the campuses are
saying probably, probably, probably, '' Scheuerman said.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WHEN the service was over and the funeral procession began slowly
rolling away, they stood shoulder to shoulder on the lush green
grass of St. James Episcopal Church.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if it was 1965 _ or 1945 _ all over again.
</P>
<P>
   It was Prairie View A&AMP;M's proudest players standing tall and
straight for the man they loved, former Panthers coach Billy Nicks.
</P>
<P>
   It was images of two-a-days, bear crawls and three-man rolls
coming back like it all happened just yesterday. It was memories of
bloody knuckles, sore necks, long nights in study hall and the
watchful tap-tap-tap of Nicks personally knocking on dormitory
doors making sure lights were out by 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was more than a coach,'' former assistant Hoover Wright
said. ``He turned players into men.''
</P>
<P>
   And so Tuesday was a time to remember championships, tough
practices and a molder of men who coached football and directed
lives for more than four decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told coach (Woody) Hayes a long time ago that we always
believed those Prairie View teams were like the black Notre Dame,''
former Panthers player Bill Downey said. ``He told me, `Not really.
Notre Dame was the white Prairie View.'''
</P>
<P>
   On the field, the things Nicks did with X's and O's proved to be
well ahead of their time, if not always universally acknowledged.
He scripted the first series of offensive plays decades before
former San Francisco 49ers coach Bill Walsh _ often credited with
developing the technique _ ever did.
</P>
<P>
   He developed diverse passing philosophies and attacking
defenses. He was meticulous about individualized meetings and
scouting reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't for coach Nicks, I don't think I would have ever
done the things I did in the game,'' said longtime NFL scout
Charles Garcia, who worked more than 20 years for the Seahawks,
Browns, Patriots and Bears. ``You can look around he made a
difference with everyone here.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of them stood there Tuesday on the lawn of St. James
Church, flecks of gray in their hair and Panthers pride burning in
their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   They stood shoulder to shoulder, smaller guys in front, linemen
in back, chests out, chins high. They smiled. And then someone took
a team picture for the ages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes coach Nicks would break you down, because he knew
you had to be built into something greater,'' said Leon Carr, a
defensive back and quarterback on Prairie View's back-to-back NAIA
national championship teams of 1963 and 1964. ``That's exactly what
he did. He made you a man.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why they came to pay tribute to one of the greatest
football coaches and builders of character the sport has ever
known. They cried and laughed. They reminisced and lamented the
loss of a man who had retired nearly 35 years earlier but still was
known simply as ``coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's football fans might know Nicks only because his name was
etched among the immortals at the College Football Hall of Fame
this year. Time tends to make people forget some heroes, especially
when that hero quietly applied his craft at a predominantly black
college, working at a school tucked away off a farm road in
Southeast Texas.
</P>
<P>
   For many, he is known only for the impressive numbers on the
plaque in his honor hanging on a museum wall in South Bend, Ind. _
195 wins, 60 losses, five national championships and eight
Southwestern Athletic Conference championships.
</P>
<P>
   But as you saw Nicks' proteges gather for the impromptu team
picture Tuesday morning, you saw a living tribute to the man who
wanted more than just touchdowns and championships from his
players. You saw just how far-reaching his influence was.
</P>
<P>
   There were doctors, lawyers, business executives, politicians,
former NFL greats, high school coaches, college coaches, NFL
scouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a profound mentor,'' said Downey, who in 1945 was
kicked out of school by Nicks for performing poorly in class but
after being allowed back in never failed to make the honor roll.
</P>
<P>
   When his Panthers career ended in the late 1940s, Downey became
a decorated officer in the military. His most vivid memory of the
effect Nicks had on the game and its people might have best
illustrated why generations showed up in Nicks' honor Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969 while a colonel in the military, Downey was commanding a
unit in Vietnam when he got word that Hayes, who was touring
Southeast Asia after taking Ohio State to the Rose Bowl, wanted to
meet him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Why does he want to meet me here?''' Downey said.
``But he heard that I had played for (Nicks).''
</P>
<P>
   Hayes was escorted to the battlefield headquarters and met with
Downey for hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me, `In my circles, when we mention the word coach, I
only think of two men _ Billy Nicks and John Wooden,''' Downey
said. ``He said, `Those are true coaches.' It inspired me.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest reason football historians do not list Nicks
with the likes of Eddie Robinson is because predominantly black
colleges were not fully appreciated until Robinson broke Amos
Alonzo Stagg's all-time win record. And Nicks retired in 1965, long
before Robinson's name earned its place among the game's greats.
</P>
<P>
   But Nicks should not be forgotten as one of the greatest of the
great. Just ask one of those who stood there shoulder to shoulder
in a team picture for the ages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had coach Nicks stayed around longer,'' Carr said, ``he would
have gotten all the recognition that Eddie Robinson got. Because he
would have just kept on beating Robinson like he always did.''
