COSTLY VICTORY FOR DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK -- It's a win the Dodgers will remember for many of the
right reasons, and one they surely won't forget soon because two of
the most integral pieces of the team were injured.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers scored four runs in the ninth inning, the final
three coming on Devon White's two-out homer, and Eric Karros'
second homer of the day in the 10th inning lifted the Dodgers to an
unthinkable 6-5 win against the Mets at Shea Stadium on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But in the midst of ending a three-game losing streak, the
Dodgers lost much more. Right-handed ace Kevin Brown fractured his
right pinkie and is expected to miss three to four weeks. Left
fielder Gary Sheffield suffered a high ankle sprain. X-rays were
negative and he's listed as day-to-day, but a more definitive
timetable should be available after he's evaluated today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice win, but at the expense of the win we would have
rather taken the `L' and been healthy,'' Karros said. ``Hopefully,
we weather the storm until those guys return. Everyone talked about
how much deeper we are this year and we'll find out. This is as big
a test as we can have.''
</P>
<P>
   White and Karros took front and center late against the Mets.
All but finished, Karros led off the ninth with a homer against
John Franco, who walked Chad Kreuter and allowed a single to Kevin
Elster. Jose Vizcaino flied out, but White hit Franco's first pitch
over the right-center field fence to tie it 5-5.
</P>
<P>
   Karros then homered off Armando Benitez with two outs in the
10th to give the Dodgers the lead. Mike Fetters (1-0) recorded the
win in relief and Jeff Shaw had his first save, but there was
concern afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was cheating,'' White said. ``I was looking on the outside
part of the plate and it was up.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only are the Dodgers faced with not having Brown for the
next month, but they must hope Sheffield's injury isn't serious and
he can return shortly.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, right-handed reliever Gregg Olson could miss
significant time with a strained right forearm. The Dodgers trailed
5-1 entering the ninth after Olson, grimacing after almost every
pitch, allowed a pair of runs in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great game to win at a terrific cost,'' Dodgers manager
Davey Johnson said. ``We have the young arms who had a great
opportunity last year, and they're going to have to stand up.
There's a good feeling on this ball club. He's a terrific loss, but
other guys are just going to have to step it up. We can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers spent the spring talking about depth in starting
pitching in Eric Gagne, Jeff Williams and Mike Judd. Now, it
appears two of the three will get opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   While obviously not enthused with the injuries, Dodgers general
manager Kevin Malone instead chose to look ahead to how much more
prepared each of the aforementioned young pitchers are to help this
year after gaining valuable experience last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Williams, Judd and Gagne, that is one area where we have
some depth,'' Malone said. ``I'm going took at this as an
opportunity to show what we can do. It's an opportunity for young
guys to pick us up early in the year. We're fortunate in a sense
that we have some good, young arms.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield injured his ankle when he twisted it on the warning
track chasing a fly ball in the first inning. Brown broke his
pinkie when he tried to bunt a Pat Mahomes pitch in the top of the
fifth. The ball struck Brown's hand squarely, though he remained in
the game and pitched the bottom of the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely not what you want to see,'' Dodgers right
fielder Shawn Green said. ``Those are two huge pieces of the
puzzle. You hope you get them back quick. Both are competitors and
know how to play with pain.As soon as they can go, they'll be ready
to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said decisions will be made today on whom to place on
the disabled list. Brown, barring a miracle, is expected to make
his fifth career trip to the disabled. Olson is also a favorite to
go on the disabled list while questions about Sheffield's health
should be cleared today.

SINGH SURVIVES TOUGH CONDITIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. - Saturday at the Masters, two things occurred that
have been forecast all week: a squall struck Augusta National Golf
Club and Tiger Woods stormed up the leaderboard.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, one of the first dozen players to tee off in the third
round after surviving by one shot the second-day cut, enjoyed the
best of the bad weather and he took full advantage. The 1997
Masters champion posted a 4-under-par 68 that swept him out of a
tie for 39th, where he had started the day, into a tie for second
in the clubhouse at 1-under-par with Davis Love III, who also fired
a 68, and Canadian Mike Weir (70).
</P>
<P>
   The gathering gale forced the suspension of play for two hours
shortly after noon, before the final 10 pairings had teed off.
Those golfers, which included the 36-hole leader David Duval, would
bear the brunt of the winds, which gusted to 25 miles per hour in
the afternoon after play resumed.
</P>
<P>
   Given the conditions, Vijay Singh's 2-under-par showing through
14 holes was suitable for framing. He'll apply the finishing
touches to his third round today along with seven other golfers who
were chased off the course by darkness, and then return to the
course for his final round.
</P>
<P>
   Duval, who has been doggedly pursuing his first Grand Slam
victory, was 2-over-par for his round and is three shots behind
Singh, his playing partner.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, 24, was in the midst of a four-birdie stretch that
started on the par-4 seventh hole when play was suspended. ``To all
of the sudden have that come to a stop was a little
disconcerting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was downright discomfiting for the sexagenarian set. Jack
Nicklaus, 60, and Tommy Aaron, 63, clearly had a tough time getting
their creaky limbs loose after inertia was allowed to settle like a
draft into their old bones.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus, who began the day at even par, struggled to a
9-over-par 81, his worst score in 155 rounds here.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron, who became the oldest golfer in Masters history to
survive the 36-hole cut, parred the first six holes before the rain
delay and played the first two holes after it in 4-over-par. He
would finish with an 86.
</P>
<P>
   Woods grabbed a bite to eat during the delay and continued to
chew up the course once play resumed. He parred 11 and birdied two
of the next four holes before giving back a stroke with a missed
six-foot par putt at 17.
</P>
<P>
   He scrambled nicely on the par-4 finishing hole to escape with a
par and with his red-number running score intact. In his mind, the
die was cast on his resplendent round hours before he stood over
his putt on 18.
</P>
<P>
   Woods knew it was going to be his day when his tee shot on the
par-3 fourth hole sailed left of the green but he got up and down
to save par. ``More than anything,'' Woods said, ``it's a
confidence-builder knowing you can hit a bad shot like that and go
on to par (the hole].''
</P>
<P>
   That's just what the other 56 golfers vying for the Masters
green jacket wanted to hear. Woods gaining more confidence is like
Shaquille O'Neal getting more height.
</P>
<P>
   It's scary.
</P>
<P>
   You didn't hear that from Davis Love III, though. Love, 35, was
criticized by his peers after admitting last month at a tournament
in Orlando that Woods has become an intimidating presence on the
Tour.
</P>
<P>
   After matching Woods stroke for stroke, Love amended his earlier
comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair to say that Tiger Woods is very hard to beat right
now,'' Love said. ``And if he plays 100 percent (today), he's going
to be hard to beat. But I came here this week to win. So did a lot
of other guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Depending on how Singh fares in the frost and much later in the
furnace that is the finishing back nine, a lot of other guys could
yet don the green jacket. Steve Jones is putting superbly and has
20 holes remaining to move up from plus-1.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lehman, the 1996 British Open champion, also has 20 holes to
rocket from plus-1 to No. 1. In all, 10 of the 17 golfers
positioned just below Singh at Saturday's end have won at least one
of golf's four majors.
</P>
<P>
   One of those players, Nick Price, perhaps put it best after
living to tell about his third-round 73. ``Whatever is going to
happen out there,''he said, ``is going to happen.''

PALMER LOOKS GOOD FOR USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Spring scrimmages don't usually prove a lot,
especially by the time fall rolls around.
</P>
<P>
   But USC's spring scrimmage did prove two things Saturday:
Quarterback Carson Palmer's arm is as strong as ever, and the
Trojans' kicking game is shaky as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer had no problem throwing the deep ball in USC's 102-play
scrimmage before 4,000 at the Coliseum, although his receivers
didn't always help him out. As for the kicking game, there's plenty
to work on before the Aug. 27 season opener against Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer, who redshirted last year after breaking his collarbone,
completed 14 of 21 passes for 155 yards and one touchdown, and his
stats would have been even better if some perfectly thrown long
balls were not dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt good,'' Palmer said. ``It's going to take awhile to be
in the position I was. I have a ways to go. I still need to get my
timing back.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the kicking game, it has more than a ways to go. USC
converted just one of five field goals. Junior David Newbury was 1
for 4 with one kick blocked, and senior David Bell was 0 for 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know my dissatisfaction with the kicking game and we're
going to spend a lot of time on it,'' USC coach Paul Hackett said.
``Our two kickers have to get a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   Between the two, Bell clearly had a better spring, but he got
all the attempts in last week's scrimmage, so Hackett let Newbury
take most of the kicks Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In a change, Hackett decided to work the first-string offense
against the first-string defense, and the Trojans defense pretty
much shut down the running game except for Malaefou MacKenzie's
71-yard touchdown run up the middle. MacKenzie finished with 87
yards in 10 carries. His counterpart, Sultan McCullough, gained 26
yards in eight carries, and it appears the two will enter training
camp sharing time at tailback.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could co-exist, and if they did, I'd like to have both in
the backfield at the same time,'' Hackett said. ``We're going to
have both on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   It will get even more complicated when incoming freshman Chris
Howard of Banning High arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Former Alemany High tailback Miguel Fletcher had 33 yards in 11
carries.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Marcell Allmond had four receptions for 93 yards,
including an 18-yard touchdown pass from Palmer. Steve Stevenson,
playing on the second-team offense, had five catches for 55 yards,
including a 5-yard touchdown pass from Mike Van Raaphorst (11 for
22 yards, one touchdown,one interception).
</P>
<P>
   The defense was led by strong safety Ife Ohalete, playing on the
second unit, with 13 tackles. The No.1 defense featured Troy
Polamalu at strong safety and DeShaun Hill at free safety.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle Lonnie Ford had six tackles, including three
sacks. Linebacker Zeke Moreno also had six tackles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the defense looked fast and played good coverage,''
Hackett said.

LAKERS STRUGGLE WITHOUT SHAQ
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Even with a bum ankle, even with his afghan-sized
No. 34 jersey hanging in the locker room, even while sitting
courtside in a periwinkle suit, Shaquille O'Neal showed again
Saturday why he's the MVP of this league.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps it was his teammates who made the case for him.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, it meant a loss for the Lakers, who without O'Neal
looked overwhelmingly uninspired and were routed 98-80 by the San
Antonio Spurs at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   They lost O'Neal to an ankle sprain before the game had begun.
Then they lost a golden opportunity to send a message to the Spurs,
their frequent tormentor and potential second-round playoff
opponent. They lost their 11-game winning streak and 14-game home
streak.
</P>
<P>
   And they lost the chance to reach the hallowed 70-win mark this
season.
</P>
<P>
   How's that for a losing streak?
</P>
<P>
   Meaningless as it all was -- the Lakers (64-13) already have the
NBA's best record wrapped up -- it still stung.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm embarrassed,'' Rick Fox said. ``It's the first time we've
played without (O'Neal) in a long time. And we didn't step to a
level that we should have.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they sunk to a level the Lakers hadn't visited in
months.
</P>
<P>
   Their scoring total was a season low, a point less than they
scored in a Feb. 1 loss at San Antonio. The 18-point margin of
defeat was second only to the 24-point loss the Spurs handed them
in that same game. Their shooting percentage (31.6) was a season
low, rivaled only by the 33.7 they posted in a Nov. 12 loss to
Houston -- not coincidentally, the last time O'Neal missed a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really played a poor game today,'' coach Phil Jackson said.
``We shot the ball poorly, and outside of one little run early in
the ballgame, we really didn't contest this team very well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers fell to 0-2 in games without their leader in scoring,
rebounding, shooting percentage and blocked shots, not to mention
visceral emotion. It was a harsh reminder of how much the Lakers
(64-12) have come to rely on O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we've been on his back all year,'' Fox said, ``and
there's a reason why he's MVP. We faced the (defending) world
champions tonight, and they played like the world champions. And we
played like a team without Shaq.''
</P>
<P>
   They also played like a team with nothing left to gain in the
regular season, which they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always play the game with a fire,'' Fox said. ``Obviously,
it burned kind of low tonight for some reason. Shaq is more than
just our offensive and defensive anchor, he's also a lot of emotion
for us, a lot of adrenaline. We even missed him out in our huddle
when we first started the game.''
</P>
<P>
   That 7-foot-1, 330-pound void was tough to fill, in body or
spirit, especially against the Spurs' two 7-footers. Tim Duncan
went for 26 points and four blocked shots, David Robinson got 15
points.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant looked determined to make up for O'Neal's absence by
himself, taking a career-high 30 shots and making only 12 of them,
for 26 points, eight rebounds and five assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had some difficult shots he put up, some shots that weren't
high-percentage shots,'' Jackson said. ``He probably missed four or
five shots that looked good, were good, and probably took five
shots he shouldn't have taken.''
</P>
<P>
   John Salley, Travis Knight and 6-10 Robert Horry took turns at
center,combining for six points and 14 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be situations in the playoffs when Shaq's
going to be in foul trouble or whatever and we're going to have to
execute without him,'' Knight said. ``That's something we're going
to have to work on.''
</P>
<P>
   As for a 70-win season, ``It means we can do it next year,''
said Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't provide the energy necessary today to support that
and give ourselves the opportunity to get there,'' Jackson said of
70 wins. ``That's OK. That wasn't a goal. The goal was that we're
on track with what we want to do and go forward from there.''

NO TIME TO GAMBLE FOR LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When the Lakers clinched the NBA's best record
last week, they earned the right not to take unnecessary gambles,
so Shaquille O'Neal sat in street clothes Saturday while his team
played the San Antonio Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal's sprained left ankle isn't serious enough to keep him
out of a must-win game, but it is enough of a concern that no one
wanted to push it, with the playoffs just two weeks away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that if it was in the playoffs, definitely we'd play
him, and it wouldn't be a question,'' coach Phil Jackson said,
``but at this time, no, it's definitely precautionary.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal did not speak to reporters before ducking into the
training room for treatment before the game and left quickly
afterward. The sprain has been classified as mild, but it might
also keep him out of Monday's home game against Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said basically, if it was the playoffs, it wouldn't be a
question, that he'd have to go, if it was an important, meaningful
game like that,'' Jackson said. ``This is meaningful, but as far as
whether or not it ultimately means anything when it comes all the
way down to the end of the season, no, this is one you have to sit
out and take your lumps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll go game-to-game probably. We have to see how he
recovers, because it's obvious that if he doesn't play Monday,
he'll have two or three extra days rest until (the Lakers play)
Sacramento next Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Jackson, O'Neal sprained the ankle in the first
half of the Lakers' victory at Golden State on Wednesday, on a play
when O'Neal blocked a shot by the Warriors' Jason Caffey. Jackson
said he was unaware of the injury, and O'Neal played the rest of
the game, finishing with 49 points.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal missed just his second game of the season, and first
because of injury. His only other absence, Nov. 12, was the result
of a suspension for fighting.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Hot Rice:!off! Without O'Neal, the offense struggled, but
Glen Rice reemerged, at least for a quarter. With a 12-point burst
in the third quarter, Rice scored 17 points, his highest output in
five games.
</P>
<P>
   And after going four games without making a 3-pointer, Rice hit
all three of his attempts Saturday. He did struggle a bit overall,
hitting 5 of 14 field-goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't challenge Glen. I wanted him to provide that energy
for himself,'' Jackson said. ``He knew what needed to be done out
there, and he tried to get going. Obviously, things didn't come
back to him as often as he would have liked, and he didn't have as
many opportunities as he would like, but he hit our only 3-point
shots tonight. That was the best thing about his game.''

MERCKER HAS FOND MEMORIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM - Angels reliever Kent Mercker had just entered the
clubhouse after batting practice Saturday afternoon when a reporter
asked him if there was anything special about the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's my dad's birthday,'' Mercker said.
</P>
<P>
   And?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah. This is the anniversary of my no-hitter,'' he said.
``My wife called me this morning to remind me of my dad's birthday,
and that's when I remembered the no-hitter because it happened on
the same day.''
</P>
<P>
   On April 8, 1994, Mercker, pitching for the Atlanta Braves,
threw a no-hitter against the Dodgers at Dodger Stadium. He
remembered a couple of nice defensive plays, one by third baseman
Terry Pendleton and one by center fielder Deion Sanders. He got the
last out on a comebacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``That seems like a long time ago.... I've played with six
different teams since then,'' he said. ``I think what stands out
was in the top of the ninth, I came to the plate and everyone was
standing and cheering for me. That was weird coming on the road.
Then with two outs in the bottom of the ninth, the crowd was going
wild. Other than it happening in Atlanta, I don't think there would
be a better place than Dodger Stadium. Sandy Koufax was my idol.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercker was the fifth starter for the Braves that year, behind
Greg Maddux, John Smoltz, Tom Glavine and Steve Avery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony of it all was I think I'm the only guy in baseball
history to throw a no-hitter and then have my next start skipped
because we had an off-day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it was Mercker's first start of the season, when
pitch counts are usually strictly enforced, Braves manager Bobby
Cox let Mercker go the distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no-hitters after six innings twice once in '91 and once
in '93 and Bobby pulled me,'' Mercker said. ``I was primarily a
reliever back then; I wasn't conditioned to throw that many
pitches. But this time, I think he just thought he'd better let me
go.''
</P>
<P>
   When Mercker was pulled from the game after six no-hit innings
in 1991, Mark Wohlers (two innings) and Alejandro Pena (one inning)
completed the combined no-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Healed starter: Jarrod Washburn made 63 pitches in three innings
of a rehab start at Single-A Lake Elsinore and proved the strained
oblique muscle in his right side has healed.
</P>
<P>
   He was optioned to Triple-A Edmonton, where he will join the
starting rotation and make his first start Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Needs to be held: First, Mo Vaughn showed the Yankees, then the
Red Sox. Both teams didn't hold Vaughn at first and he stole
second. He got such a good jump against the Red Sox, he stole
second standing up.
</P>
<P>
   The two steals equal the most since he had 11 in 1995, when he
was the MVP of the American League. Last season, because of a badly
sprained ankle, he had none.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last year, I couldn't do nothing,'' he said. ''So they played
back. But I know how to read the pitcher, so I gotta go. That's
another run. No more station-to-station. They're giving me that,
I'm going to take it.''

STATE HALTS EXOTIC ANIMAL RESCUES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DONNA HUFFAKER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Wildlife Waystation, the nation's largest
rescue sanctuary for exotic animals, has run afoul of regulations
intended to protect the health of people.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Fish and Game has ordered the facility
closed to tour groups, as well as to any more animals. The
sanctuary already is home to nearly 1,200 lions, tigers, wolves and
other creatures. The order came Friday, one week after Department
of Fish and Game inspectors said they found animal excrement
washing into a creek.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our major concern is the health and safety of the people who
might come into contact with these animals and the people who live
downstream,'' said Stanley Young, communications director of the
state Resources Agency, which oversees the Department of Fish and
Game.
</P>
<P>
   The situation leaves the future of the internationally renowned
sanctuary uncertain and has infuriated Martine Colette, the founder
and director.
</P>
<P>
   ``They closed us down. That's what they did,'' Colette said.
``We can't raise funds. We can't raise money to feed the animals. I
don't know where the animals are going to go. I'm where they go
when they have nowhere to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Colette denies there is any danger to the public from the way
she operates the 160-acre sanctuary in a remote area of the Angeles
National Forest hills, above the San Fernando Valley. She also
denies washing animal excrement into streams that run from the
Waystation into the Tujunga Wash.
</P>
<P>
   The cease-and-desist order came after the most thorough
inspection ever conducted at the Wildlife Waystation, which has
operated without a required state permit since February 1998.
Officials would not renew the permit because they said the
sanctuary is crowded and some cages are unsecured.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about cages prompted the inspection, and then
inspectors saw the apparent contamination of clean stream water
with animal waste, Young said, and concern arose about public
health and safety.
</P>
<P>
   Young said officials also are concerned about disposal of waste
from a chimpanzee that carries hepatitis B, a serious disease that
can be passed through bodily waste. The chimp is quarantined, but
state officials do not know how its waste is disposed, Young said.
</P>
<P>
   The question: What should be done with the Waystation's lions,
tigers, bears, monkeys and other exotic animals rescued from
medical researchers, exhibitors and individual owners.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from the Department of Fish and Game said they
will continue working with the Waystation to gain compliance with
state regulations. The object is to get the facility running safely
and legally, said Steve Martarano, department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   That could take hundreds of thousands of dollars that the
Waystation doesn't have, Colette said.
</P>
<P>
   To regain a permit, which allows exhibiting exotic animals, the
center must prove it has a proper disease-prevention program, and
it must improve cages that are crowded and roofless.
</P>
<P>
   Spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on improvements would
make it impossible for the Waystation workers to rescue and feed
more animals, they have said.
</P>
<P>
   But the state order puts rescuing any more exotic animals on
hold for the Waystation, and it calls for reducing the number of
animals already there, Martarano said.
</P>
<P>
   Colette insists there is no public safety issue. Waystation
workers do not wash anything directly into the streams, she said.
Pond water, however, flows into the streams as water runs downhill,
she conceded. Fish and Game officials have known that for 25 years,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions are safe, she said, adding that 100 people, including
herself, live on the compound.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole life has been about saving and caring for these
animals. They are safe, and they are comfortable. We have done all
that we can do,'' Colette said.
</P>
<P>
   The Waystation, with an annual budget of $2.5 million, relies
heavily on sponsor donations and membership dues to keep the animal
sanctuary running, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Waystation is seeking exemptions from some very expensive
requirements, said Byron Countryman, an attorney and member of the
facility's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just so incredible what is required; it's so expensive.
When we had to make a choice between the animal's welfare and its
cage, the answer was simple,'' Countryman said.
</P>
<P>
   Of more than 200 cages, inspectors last week found roughly 1/3
adequate, 1/3 cramped and 1/3 in need of drastic changes.
</P>
<P>
   Colette said some cages have been fixed, but the biggest problem
is in the temporary housing for chimpanzees until a new primate
center is completed.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 30 chimps -- most of the 50 she rescued from biomedical
research two years ago -- are living in cages surrounded by plywood
and roofing. The cages are high enough for the chimps to stretch
and swing, Colette said, but they should be exposed to more
daylight. Also, some of the cages do not meet state requirements
for the amount of space per animal.

HILL, ERSTAD DELIVER FOR ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM - Going into the season, two of the Angels' biggest
question marks were Ken Hill and Darin Erstad. But so far, Hill and
Erstad have been more like exclamation points.
</P>
<P>
   The two continued their early-season successes Saturday night,
helping the Angels to a 7-5 victory over the Boston Red Sox before
27,369 at Edison Field. It was the Angels' third win in a row and
put them in a tie for first in the AL West with the Seattle
Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   That is significant because the Angels haven't had a share of
the top spot in the division since last April 17. At 3-2, it's the
first time the Angels have been over .500 since last April 16
(6-5).
</P>
<P>
   The Angels survived a late-inning rally by the Red Sox against
the Angels bullpen, but Troy Percival pitched the ninth for his
first save.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Hill a question mark for the Angels is his arthritic
right elbow. But his performances in his first two starts have
shown his elbow is fine for now. Saturday, he gave up one run and
two hits in six innings while making 98 pitches. He struggled a
little with his control, walking five. In addition to his
opening-night start against the Yankees, Hill has given up three
runs and six hits in 11 innings (2.38 ERA).
</P>
<P>
   Erstad was a question mark because he had struggled miserably
since making the All-Star team in 1998. Last season he hit only
.253, after hitting .299 and .296 in his first two full seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Erstad went 3 for 5 to raise his batting average to a
league-leading .583 (14 for 24). He singled twice, doubled, drove
in a run and scored another.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad led off the bottom of the first with a single, the fourth
time in five games he's led off the game for the Angels with a hit.
After a walk by Adam Kennedy, Mo Vaughn singled to left field to
score Erstad for a 1-0 Angels lead.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Salmon's flyout to deep center field moved Kennedy from
second to third, and he scored when Garret Anderson grounded into a
fielder's choice to make it 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hill was making quick work of the Red Sox hitters,
with a little help from his defense.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Offerman led off the first inning with a walk but was
thrown out by catcher Bengie Molina trying to steal. In the second,
Nomar Garciaparra singled but was erased on a double play. Carl
Everett followed with a walk, but he, too, was caught stealing.
</P>
<P>
   After walking Darren Lewis with two out in the third inning,
Hill retired the next nine hitters. But with two out in the sixth,
Offerman walked and took second on a wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Trot Nixon followed with a grounder to the hole at second, where
Kennedy made a diving stab of the ball. But when he tried to
transfer the ball from his glove to his hand, the ball popped free,
allowing Nixon to reach with a hit and Offerman to score from
second. Nixon went to second on a wild pitch and Brian Daubach
walked, bringing up Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, that would mean trouble, but Garciaparra has struggled
so far this season. Going into the game, he was hitting .125 (2 for
16) with only one RBI. He flied out to left field to end the threat
and Hill held onto his 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Ken, we want to get him to stay within his mechanics and
stay within his delivery, and to be pitch-efficient,'' Angels
manager Mike Scioscia said. ``We'll gradually increase pitch count
so he can pitch deep into ballgames. This is as strong as he's felt
in the last couple years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels increased their lead with four runs in the bottom of
the sixth, including an RBI double by Troy Glaus, and a two-run
homer by Scott Spiezio, his first as an Angel. Erstad doubled in
the fourth run of the inning for a 6-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox scored two runs in the seventh off the Angels
bullpen, but it could have been worse. Kent Mercker and Shigetoshi
Hasegawa combined to walk three and give up two hits, but Hasegawa
got out of it by getting Nixon to hit into an inning-ending double
play with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox added two more runs off Mark Petkovsek in the eighth
on a couple of two-out hits - Everett's RBI double and Jason
Varitek's RBI single.

LOS ANGELES: space per animal. 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Los Angeles County veterinary officials said the Waystation
workers could not provide medical records for the animals during
last week's inspection, the first in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Field inspectors examined Waystation programs for handling and
preventing animal diseases. Dr. Patrick Ryan, county veterinary
health spokesman, said it was not clear whether the animals had
been vaccinated against tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concerned about disease prevention programs. Primates
are very susceptible to TB,'' Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   Colette said the animals are treated well.
</P>
<P>
   One day, the chimps will move into a primate center designed
especially for them, she said. But that project, said Colette,
shaking her head, is another nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a surveyor's error, the mammoth primate center was
built partly on U.S. Forest Service Land, she said. Ironing out the
problem has taken years, but it appears resolved. So the chimps,
who on Thursday nibbled on chunks of ice, strawberries and jelly
beans Colette fed to them, will be relocated when construction is
done.
</P>
<P>
   The chimps' temporary housing is still far better than the tiny
cages they occupied in laboratories, Colette said.
</P>
<P>
   But expensive improvements to the temporary housing would be
impractical, Countryman said.
</P>
<P>
   Fish and Game officials sympathize with the herculean task
facing the Waystation, said Mervin Hee, regional patrol chief for
the Fish and Game.
</P>
<P>
   Impressed that Colette has saved thousands of animals on a
limited budget since the sanctuary opened in 1976, Hee reiterated
his department's goal of helping the center.
</P>
<P>
   If that's true, Colette said, state officials should grant her
an exemption from some of the state codes.
</P>
<P>
   Take old Jake the grizzly bear, for example. Under state
regulations, a cage or enclosure for a grizzly bear must measure at
least 400 square feet and have a ceiling or roof at least 8 feet
from the floor or ground.
</P>
<P>
   Colette stopped at Jake's chain-link home and pointed out the
violation: no roof. Jake, a slow-moving, hulking bear, waddled
across the otherwise code-compliant cage and nuzzled his head
against Colette's hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are fat, lazy bears. They're not nimble cubs that are
going to scurry on out of there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Colette stopped at Idaho Row, a neighborhood of Waystation pens
named for the 27 lions she rescued five years ago from what she
said was a squalid facility in Idaho. Those cages also do not meet
state code because of missing tension bars and poles that cross the
cage roof.
</P>
<P>
   State officials will continue investigating the Waystation,
Martarano said, including reports of Waystation chimps that were
exposed to HIV. ``We hope to get them into compliance. We don't
want to have to shut them down,'' he said.

THOMAS READY AND WAITING FOR JOB OFFERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF   
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As many as 10 NBA coaching jobs could open in the
next month, and you can bet Isiah Thomas will try to land one of
them. But not much else is known, except for the fact that college
coaches probably will not get a single one.
</P>
<P>
   Check out recent history, and see how well John Calipari, P.J.
Carlesimo and Rick Pitino have worked out. So let's handicap the
current or soon-to-be-available jobs and what might happen.
</P>
<P>
   Hawks: Lenny Wilkens is out? Well, let's put it this way. He's
building a house in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks: Don Nelson has reluctantly announced he will not
return, hence the Mavs' sudden surge in the standings. But one, or
all, of his 10 assistants would like the job. The front-runner is
former Lakers coach Del Harris, but new owner Mark Cuban wouldn't
mind a big name and is considering Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Clippers: Jim Todd will be cleaning out his office as soon as
the season ends, and there's plenty of speculation that Dennis
Johnson and/or Kareem Abdul-Jabbar could join him. Mike Fratello's
name keeps surfacing, although let's hope it's for nothing more
than the TV analyst position.
</P>
<P>
   Grizzlies: Lionel Hollins threatened to quit Thursday night,
before Vancouver gave him a cash settlement to bring his assistant
coach's salary to an acceptable level. New consultant Dick Versace
is expected to bring in his own guy, and that means a retread
should be running the team next season.
</P>
<P>
   There was some semblance of competency this week, when Chuck
Daly was offered a job as team president, but Daly turned it down.
</P>
<P>
   Pacers: Larry Bird already announced he's quitting, and while
assistant coach Rick Carlisle would probably be a super fit, or
even former Laker and former Pacer Byron Scott could get the job,
watch out for Thomas. Pacers GM Donnie Walsh has been doing some
background checks on the CBA commish/NBA studio man. That should
make everyone in Indy sufficiently nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Pistons: The Pistons were supposed to conduct a search that
would include taking a close look at former player Bill Laimbeer.
But interim coach George Irvine has done such a good job, they may
be forced to keep him, especially if Grant Hill delivers his
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Wizards: Washington is expected to take another try at hiring
Michael Jordan buddy/Golden State assistant Rod Higgins after the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Nets: Don Casey's stock keeps sliding, and Stephon Marbury's
injury has not helped the situation. Brace yourself for the latest
name to surface at the Meadowlands. Would you believe... Rick
Pitino?
</P>
<P>
   Warriors: Garry St. Jean has Golden State on the brink of an
18-win season. He isn't expected back, but the Warriors are so
hapless, no names have even surfaced. One person who would love the
job is former Warriors great Rick Barry, who has basically been
blacklisted throughout the league for his strong opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Nike speaks: A few weeks back, we reported that Sonics forward
Ruben Patterson blamed his foot injury on his Nikes. Patterson also
said Gary Payton and Vin Baker had problems with their shoes.
</P>
<P>
   A Nike spokesperson wrote this week, and we'd like to give him
equal time. The spokesperson said that Nike ``learned that Ruben,
despite receiving many pairs of shoes per month from Nike, was
wearing the same pair for several weeks at a time, for games and
practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most NBA players change to new shoes much more frequently, and
some even wear a new pair for every game (like Michael Jordan did).
We also have been told that Patterson does not untie his shoes, but
kicks them off, which wears down the back of the shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Nike also offered to correct Patterson's shoes, if a problem
existed. Stay tuned for further developments.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket scandal: The MSG Network has put longtime Knicks TV and
radio analyst John Andariese on ``administrative leave'' for the
rest of the season. No reason was originally given for the action,
but MSG later issued a joint statement with Andariese that the
broadcaster violated the Garden's internal policy prohibiting the
resale of tickets.
</P>
<P>
   There is some question as to whether Andariese will ever get his
job back, which means his penalty could be more severe than fellow
MSG announcer Marv Albert, who was brought back after 10 months
following his hotel-room escapades.
</P>
<P>
   Bugs are repellent: Charlotte players held a players-only
meeting to discuss how to get their younger players to raise their
concentration for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie point guard Baron Davis was the main target of the
veterans' ire, for not playing hard enough. His lackluster play in
an ugly win over the Bulls was a prime source of contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know now's the time we've got to start working harder in
practice and keeping our concentration in games,'' Davis told the
Winston-Salem Journal. ``This is the time of year when we have to
step it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Portsmouth update: This weekend, college players are competing
in the Portsmouth Invitational in Virginia, where draft sleepers
are usually found. So far, this year's sleeper is center Dan
McClintock of Northern Arizona, who had 17 points, nine rebounds
and six blocked shots in one game. He's already being talked about
as a potential second-round pick.

<P>
   PROVIDENCE _ Boston College came up just short. Again.
</P>
<P>
   The title rich got richer and the Eagles are left still looking
for their second NCAA hockey championship overall and first since
1949.
</P>
<P>
   North Dakota scored two goals in the third period to come from
behind and beat BC, 4-2, Saturday &UR;  &LR; night at the Providence Civic
Center. It was the Sioux's seventh championship overall and second
in four years.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles have put together a great run: They lost to Michigan
in the finals in overtime two years ago, to Maine in the semifinals
in overtime last year, and now in the finals again.
</P>
<P>
   So close.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so tough to get here, you want to win it so bad,'' said
BC goalie Scott Clemmensen, who had 32 saves against the
hard-charging Sioux. ``It's a long, long road and we had a really
good bunch of guys and we thought this was our year.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the Sioux's.
</P>
<P>
   They made it a Boston sweep. In 1997, North Dakota beat Boston
University for their sixth title. Saturday &UR;  &LR; night, it was Boston
College's turn to take the hit.
</P>
<P>
   The Sioux, upset before the Frozen Four each of the last two
years and the Western Collegiate Hockey Association regular-season
champ the last several, took a different route to the title this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six weeks ago, we would never have dreamed of this after
losing sight of the WCHA regular-season title,'' said coach Dean
Blais. ``Instead of getting bummed out, the guys kicked it into
gear and got it done.''
</P>
<P>
   To add to the insult, the Sioux beat Boston College with a
Boston-bound guy.
</P>
<P>
   Senior forward Lee Goren, a Bruins draft pick, led the North
Dakota charge in the third. Goren, a 6-3, 205-pound scorer, scored
to tie it 2:43 into the third. He helped set up the winning goal by
Jason Ulmer with 5:38 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Then Goren scored another, into an open net, for good measure.
That goal ended any chance of a comeback and sent Hobey Baker
winner Mike Mottau sliding into the Boston College net on one knee,
where he stayed for several moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year there have been a lot of ups and downs,'' Mottau
said. ``That goal really hurt. I thought we had a chance to tie it
right before that goal. We had a real flurry at the other end. To
have my college career come to an end like that was not the way I
wanted to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the rink, North Dakota goaltender Karl
Goehring skated aorund his net in celebration. North Dakota
finishes at 31-8-5. BC, which knocked North Dakota out of the
tournament last year, is 29-12-1.
</P>
<P>
   BC's three-year quest for a title _ led by seniors Mottau, Jeff
Farkas, Blake Bellefeuille, and Kevin Caulfield _ came to a
stunning end.
</P>
<P>
   Goren and Ulmer teamed up to make it 3-2 with 5:38 left in the
game. Ulmer dropped a pass for Goren. Clemmensen stopped Goren's
shot, but the rebound bounced to the other side and Ulmer beat a
defenseman to it and banged it in.
</P>
<P>
   Just like two years ago at the FleetCenter against Michigan, the
Eagles led, 2-1, with a period to go. And just like two years ago,
the enemy tied it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``They pretty much took it to us,'' Mottau said. ``We were back
on our heels most of the period. It's real difficult to swallow.''
</P>
<P>
   North Dakota defenseman Mike Commodore opened the scoring 3:48
into the game and Farkas tied it with a power-play goal with 3:13
left in the first.
</P>
<P>
   Marty Hughes scored from Brian Gionta at 6:59 of the second and
the Eagles had their lead.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sioux were getting the better of the play. Shots were
even in the first period, but North Dakota outshot BC, 22-10, the
rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the third, they took the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Goren made the most of a second chance to even things at 2-2 at
the 2:43 mark of the third. Goren had just broken through the
middle and was in alone on Clemmensen, but the goalie stopped his
backhander. The next time down, Goren took a drop pass from Ryan
Bayda and shot from just inside the top of the right circle. The
puck went between the legs of defenseman Rob Scuderi and a screened
Clemmensen.
</P>
<P>
   It was Goren's 33d goal of the year. Soon, he would have his
34th.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles had trouble generating offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very good defensively,'' said BC coach Jerry York.
``They boxed out well. They protected their goaltender very, very
strongly. It wasn't for a lack of our trying to get at him. They
shut us down but it was still 2-2 with seven minutes left and we
were trying to get a break. We didn't get it, but if you get it,
the momentum changes in a hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles could have used a break at the midpoint of the third.
The score was 2-2 and Mottau had a chance in close. And hit the
post.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept it in at the blue line and fed it down to Gionta,''
Mottau said. ``He found Marty Hughes in the slot and I decided to
crash down. The puck was bouncing a little bit and he was at the
side of the net and I had some net to shoot at and it happened to
hit the post.''
</P>
<P>
   No bounce. No break. And no title.

AVENGERS TRY TO GET FANS' ATTENTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The provocative billboards began coming down
Friday, leaving just one remaining matter of business for what has
been hyped as Los Angeles' only professional football team: an
actual game.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment begins today, when the Avengers make their local
Arena Football League debut with an exhibition game against the
Oklahoma Wranglers at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Team officials say the game will be sold out, but it's unlikely
most of the fans in attendance today - and that includes Mayor
Richard Riordan - are quite sure what they are showing up to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way to explain it until you experience it, with
guys flying into walls,'' Avengers quarterback Scott Semptimphelter
said. ``I haven't been to a game yet that isn't fan friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   But is it football?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little different. But it's football,'' Avengers owner
Casey Wasserman said.
</P>
<P>
   Players will crash into walls, balls will bounce off nets, and
running plays will be virtually eliminated. Above all, Arena
Football is supposed to be entertaining, and the Avengers have
promised to live up to that image.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what will make me happy is to hear people after the
game say they had a great time and they fell in love with the
sport,'' Wasserman said.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old owner has done everything possible to spark the
interest of notoriously skeptical Los Angeles sports fans. That
included renting more than 1,300 billboards throughout Southern
California that drew the ire of some for their controversial
content.
</P>
<P>
   But more importantly, the billboards brought more media
attention than anyone imagined.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing we wanted to do is to create an attitude with
the team. We're doing things a little differently,'' Wasserman
said. ``We had to establish a voice for ourselves. A lot of teams
don't have a voice. The Dodgers have lost their voice a little bit.
The Angels too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lakers have a voice. Everyone knows they are Showtime.
They've built a new version with Kobe and Shaq. Everyone knows the
Lakers win.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasserman's already won over some big-time Los Angeles sports
figures. Among the season-ticket holders are former Dodgers owner
Peter O'Malley and New York Jets wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The double-edged task of the Avengers is that in addition to
providing entertainment value, they also want to win, or else they
could quickly fall off the crowded sports landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to win a championship and not just two games,''
Semptimphelter said. ``To set goals of less than a championship is
ludicrous, in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Avengers coach Stan Brock, a former NFL lineman with New Orleans
and San Diego, isn't quite as brash when making predictions, but he
doesn't want his team to be a typical expansion squad either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect us to compete in every game,'' Brock said. ``My goal
is to be in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Brock is quite serious about winning. One example is starting
Semptimphelter at quarterback. It would be more popular to start
former USC and Raiders quarterback Todd Marinovich, but he's still
learning how to play arena football.
</P>
<P>
   ``Experience outweighs ability and Scott will be my starter,''
Brock said. ``I'm very pleased with Scott.''
</P>
<P>
   It's clear that the players are just as competitive as in the
NFL, and not just playing some weird trash-sport, when
Semptimphelter talks about his role on the team, and how it relates
to the widely known Marinovich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the day I've gotten here, he's gotten a lot of
attention,'' Semptimphelter said. ``No one knows who I am. I'm sure
I will surprise people by starting. But I was not brought here to
be the backup.''
</P>
<P>
   About 75 percent of the team is composed of Arena Football
League veterans, so few names will be familiar to fans.
</P>
<P>
   Some aspects of the game should also catch people off guard. On
field goals and kickoffs, a ball is live if it hits the nets behind
the end zones, and it takes awhile to figure out who can actually
rush the quarterback. One linebacker cannot move out of an
imaginary box.
</P>
<P>
   But the thought is that fans will be more impressed by scores
such as 54-47, the final of the Avengers' exhibition victory over
Arizona last week, than the nuances of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it's an electric crowd and people are fired up about
football being back in L.A.,'' Semptimphelter said.
</P>
<P>
   Wasserman says he will be happy if the team averages 10,000 per
game this season, adding there is even a possibility the team could
make money by its second year.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his friends were skeptical about why he would sink
nearly $8 million into this venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of people who would say `Arena Football?'''
Wasserman said. ``There was bewilderment, maybe. Until they see it
on Sunday, they clearly see reservations.''
</P>
<P>
   But he believes after tonight's game, Los Angeles will embrace
the Avengers. Just as long as they can win.
</P>
<P>
   ``The X-factor is how well we do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There might be a chance the fans are not as tough to please as
expected. On the Avengers' Web site, fans were asked what they look
forward to seeing most today, other than football.
</P>
<P>
   A clear majority of 51 percent listed the team's cheerleaders.

SILENCE OF TITLE LOSS DEAFENING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE _ It was close to midnight when the last of the
Boston College hockey players left the arena. Their postgame locker
room had been so silent that even the most ordinary sounds seemed
strange. You could hear a shower running, but it sounded like rain
sizzling on summer asphalt.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing you can say to an athlete who has just lost a
championship game. There is nothing you can give, either. So as the
red-eyed players left the Providence Civic Center after their 4-2
loss to North Dakota Saturday &UR;  &LR; night, they were oblivious to many
things. One thing, especially.
</P>
<P>
   The second-place trophy rested on a table outside the BC locker
room. The players walked by and ignored it as if it were the
mystery dish at a holiday party. Coach Jerry York's wife, Bobbie,
stood next to the trophy. When it was awarded to captain Mike
Mottau after the loss, he accepted it and promptly skated to the BC
bench. He gently placed it there. Clearly, it was the last he
wanted to see of it. ``I know,'' York said, looking at the trophy,
``Motts doesn't want it.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone takes a title-game loss hard, but you could see the
pain most in two players. After North Dakota's Lee Goren scored an
empty-netter with less than a minute remaining, Mottau crouched
inside the empty net. York gathered his team to the bench and said
a few words. Very few. He has lost a championship as a BC player,
too. That was in 1965. Some things haven't changed in 35 years. You
lose a championship that you feel you should have won _ that you
feel you deserved _ and the pain is unspeakable.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as this loss was official, the North Dakota team piled
on their half of the ice and celebrated with the handful of fans
who had come to see them. On the other end, BC forward Mike Lephart
took his stick and whacked it against the post. It snapped in half.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the ``correct'' thing to do would have been to stand
with hands on hips and give props to the champions. But if you have
ever lost a championship, or the equivalent of a championship, you
know the follow-the-dots path to losing gracefully rarely happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``You lose a game like that, you don't know what to do,''
Lephart said. ``That's sports and that's life, but it's tough.''
</P>
<P>
   The toughest part was sitting there. The game was over. BC had
lost its third Frozen Four in the past four years. Seniors Mottau,
Jeff Farkas, Blake Bellefeuille, Kevin Caulfield, and Tony Hutchins
had been on the ice for all the losses. So they watched as the kids
from Fargo country celebrated. They watched until Mottau was called
to accept the trophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's hard,'' Lephart said. ``You're sitting there watching
them celebrate. You're trying to contain your emotions . . . I just
wish we could have won it for the seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   After placing the trophy near the bench, Mottau whispered to his
teammates. He picked up his stick and tapped the ice. The Eagles
followed. They saluted the fans. Then they left.
</P>
<P>
   This was tough for many reasons. Some players wanted to win the
title to reward the seven fans who drove to Madison, Wis., to watch
them play in the early rounds. Mottau wanted to win it for his
sister, Charlene Alger, who is pregnant and could not come here.
Bellefeuille wanted to win it for his family. His brother, Brian,
played at Maine and didn't win a championship. The senior even
jokingly told his father that he couldn't attend because a title
hasn't come while he's been watching.
</P>
<P>
   At least BC knows there was nothing superstitious about
Saturday &UR;  &LR; night's loss. The Fighting Sioux are the quickest team
the Eagles have faced all year. They scramble to the puck. They
scored first, and then fell behind, 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   In the third period, ironically, a Bruins draft pick changed the
game. Goren was quiet in the first two periods. During the second
intermission, a local hockey coach approached the pressbox and
said, ``The Goren kid is soft.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after that, the 6-foot-3-inch Canadian scored. He then
assisted on the goal that put the Sioux ahead for good. Then he
scored the empty-netter. The coach was right. He had played soft _
for two periods.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Mottau sat at a table and said he didn't want
his career to end like it did. He said it was a pleasure to play
for York and to play at BC. Before the third, he told his teammates
that if they could hold on to the lead, they would ``walk together
for the rest of our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That will still happen,'' York said. ``Even though we lost,
these guys will still remember each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles had left here by midnight. It was still noisy. North
Dakota's flight out of town had been delayed three hours, so there
was a raucous party. They cheered. They clapped. They sang the
North Dakota fight song.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Eagles, they didn't have to listen or watch.

GOEHRING HAS HEAD FOR GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MONAHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE _ North Dakota junior Karl Goehring made a comeback
he's proud of.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-7-inch, 150-pound goaltender from Apple Valley,
Minn., had to give up his starting role when he suffered a head
injury in practice three weeks ago. Doctors made him sit out three
games, but he finally got the green light to resume play at the
Frozen Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got banged up in a practice back home,'' said Goehring. ``We
had a spirited practice and there was plenty of activity in front
of my net and I just got whacked real hard. You never know what to
expect after a head injury and people were cautious about me
playing. But it turned out OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Goehring made 21 saves Saturday &UR;  &LR; night while beating Boston
College, 4-2. ``I have to credit my defense in general and the
forechecking of all the forwards,'' said Goehring. ``Let's face it,
Boston College is a terrific team with lots of scoring power. They
showed it real early. Then my guys played tougher as the game went
on and I saw fewer and fewer shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a matter of fact, I didn't have to work too hard in the
second and third periods (five and four saves, respectively).
Sometimes I think it's better to be making more saves. But I can't
fault this. We won it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Goehring was beaten by BC's Jeff Farkas in the first period when
BC had a power play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had it under my pads,'' said Goehring. ``It just
slipped under me and Farkas got a stick on it. Good play by him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles went up, 2-1, at 6:59 of the second when Marty Hughes
beat him with a wraparound goal.
</P>
<P>
   Said Goehring, ``That was all my fault. He just tucked it in. I
gave a little space and he jammed it in.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that, I just said to myself to relax and play smarter.''
</P>
<P>
   He did.
</P>
<P>
   North Dakota coach Dean Blais praised Goehring saying, ``Before
we came here, I was worried because he hadn't played in three
weeks. He's capable of putting up a zero. Karl is the winningest
goalie in UND history and it says a lot about him as a person. He's
learned how to anticipate shots and he learned to deflect passes
that come through the crease.''
</P>
<P>
   Andy Kollar spelled Goehring in the last game of the regular
season and in the West Regionals. He posted a 3-0 record, upping
his season mark to 11-2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Said Blais, ``I'm very proud of what Andy did. I held off naming
my starter here, but when both were healthy I just looked at the
numbers. Karl had a 1.95 goals-against average and a .924 save
percentage. Those figures are great and I just had to go with him
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``He certainly did his job.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second period, Goehring took a BC stick on the head and
fell to the ice. ``It wasn't serious. Just a blow,'' he said. ``The
trainer looked at me and I was not uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Goehring had high praise for his backup Kollar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was glad and proud the way Andy played in those three games
I was out. We're good friends and we help each other. He's the
closest thing I have to a goalie coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We watch each other and we talk a lot about how to improve.
We're good for each other. Besides, we think team more than
ourselves.''

YORK GRACIOUS IN DEFEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN VELLANTE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE _ His eyes gave his inner feelings away.
</P>
<P>
   They were red and swollen.
</P>
<P>
   Boston College hockey coach Jerry York was hurting after his
Eagles fell to North Dakota, 4-2, in Saturday &UR;  &LR; night's NCAA title
game.
</P>
<P>
   He was hurting for himself and for seniors Mike Mottau and Kevin
Caulfield, with whom he shared the post-game press conference
podium. And he was hurting for seniors Blake Bellefeuille and Jeff
Farkas, who stayed behind in the somber BC dresing room.
</P>
<P>
   But as much as it hurt, he was gracious in defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no complaining, we took a hit and the team feels North
Dakota played better than we did in the third period. I love that
feeling,'' said York.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not complaining about this or complaining about that.
We wanted to win the hockey game, but we lost it, we'll take the
hit and we'll move on. Give full measure to North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like (Mottau) said, they played extremely well in the third
period, limited our offensive chances and they do that from being
well coached and from having good players. There are no complaints
from our end.''
</P>
<P>
   BC lead, 2-1, after two periods, but North Dakota tied it 2
minutes, 43 seconds into the third period on a goal by Lee Goren.
York thought that was the key.
</P>
<P>
   ``That seemed to energize (North Dakota),'' he said. ``We're
going into the third period up 2-1 and we expected that. You don't
expect to be in the championship game and think it's going to be
8-7 or they're going to lead, 7-0. We knew it would be a tight,
hard game to play with not a lot of ice out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought when they got that second goal they just seemed to
have a lift to them. Then when it was 2-2, I think (Mottau) hit the
post. That may be the break you need in a game like this.''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the podium, York moved to the BC dressing room,
where his graciousness continued. As hard as it was, he never
ducked a question and there were many thrown his way.
</P>
<P>
   He was asked if the fact the team hadn't won a national
championship since 1949 weighed heavily on the program
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a great motivating force for us to win another
championship,'' he said. ``I think you can tell that from our
resurgence of the past three years. We're focused and we want to
win a national championship. But you don't always get what you wish
for. I don't think (not winning since 1949) is a negative factor.
It's more like let's go win another one.''
</P>
<P>
   When someone asked how the team was doing, York's eyes filled
with tears and his voice quivered.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not doing real well because this was something we had
our heart and soul set on doing. To get to the championship game
like this and be ahead, 2-1, we're 20 minutes away from achieving
that goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to tell you, though, they gave full credit to North
Dakota. They played very well. I told our guys to stand up and
shake a senior hand. our four seniors played their hearts out. I
think there's a special feeling in the lockerroom right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, York was asked if this, or losing the title game in
overtime to Michigan two years ago, hurt more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current is most hard,' he said. ``It's hard to reflect
back. We were 20 minutes from winning the game and with that game
comes the national championship. You don't get that opportunity
very often.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he retreated into the lockerroom, where the tears and the
consoling began anew.

REVOLUTION FALL SHORT IN DALLAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The Revolution's long road trip wound down in
frustration as the team lost the offensive cohesiveness which had
carried it through the first three games of the season and fell,
2-1, to the Dallas Burn Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   But the Revolution, 0-2-2 going into Saturday's home-opener
against D.C. United, displayed some encouraging signs, ending the
game on the attack and taking the potential tying shot from the
goal area just before the final whistle.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Torres had a productive game at striker, converting his
first goal of the season in the 41st minute. And in his season
debut at central defense, Dan Calichman filled in strongly for Ivan
McKinley (suspended).
</P>
<P>
   Dallas, though, played like a team which has maintained a
consistent style of play and had few personnel changes in recent
years. The Burn was more resourceful, and its experience, plus the
attacking skills of Ariel Graziani paid off.
</P>
<P>
   The Burn exploited Revolution mistakes, and caught the team off
guard to score. Dallas also gained control of the midfield for long
periods of time in the first half, causing the Revolution to chase
the game and placing heavy pressure on the defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not frustrated but I am disappointed in the performance of
certain players,'' Revolution coach Fernando Clavijo said.
</P>
<P>
   Clavijo singled out Eduardo Hurtado for ``lack of effort.'' But
the Revolution did not have a strong offensive game in the first
half, while Hurtado was on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Hurtado entered in the second half in place of Wolde Harris, and
did not have an impressive game. But he did pressure defender Eric
Dade, and he won the corner kick which resulted in the last-second
near-miss by Torres.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a difficult situation for everybody,'' Clavijo said.
``It was not Wolde Harris' day, but you can't blame him. It could
be that it wasn't (Hurtado's) day, but the effort wasn't there. I
was tremendously disappointed in his performance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution, though, also had some tactical shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   Shaker Asad replaced Mauricio Ramos (suspended) left side of
midfield, but was supposed to have responsibilities as a central
midfield choreographer as well as defending on the wing. Asad had
some excellent touches, and his through ball to Torres in the 66th
minute beat goalkeeper Matt Jordan before being cleared by Ricardo
Iribarren.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Pierce had another strong game at right back, but was
caught out of position on the deciding goal.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce stifled Graziani early, and Graziani retaliated by
knocking him down and cleating his thigh. But Dallas began taking
control midway through the first half. Revolution midfielder Leonel
Alvarez, who had been the Burn's leading figure for three of their
first four years, tangled with Colombian countryman Oscar Pareja
and both received cautions in the 30th minute.
</P>
<P>
   And the Burn began dictating the tempo. Graziani shot wide from
20 yards in the 35th minute, and three minutes later he finished a
move which began with a Ted Chronopoulos giveaway. Sergi Daniv
dribbled toward the penalty area, passed to Jason Kreis, who
flicked a backheel to Chad Deering, who centered for Graziani. The
goal might have been disallowed for offside, but the Burn buildup
was quick enough to surprise the linesman. And the interplay was
dazzling enough to earn the benefit of the doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Graziani also poked a rebound off the left post in the 45th
minute, and played an important part in the deciding goal. Ted Eck
set up the goal, taking a throw-in behind the halfway line,
dribbling toward the penalty arc and finding Mark Santel on the
left wing. Santel's cross was dummied by Graziani, and Kreis
finished in front of Chronopoulos in the 74th minute.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution added William Sunsing in place of Asad, and
pushed forward in desperation in the final minutes. But Dallas had
enough resolve to hold them off, and Kreis helped goalkeeper Matt
Jordan stop the final shot, then spent several minutes on the
ground after the game recuperating from the collision.

BRUINS GET A GOOD LOOK AT GOREN 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE _ Lee Goren gave his father, Chuck, the most special
of 50th birthday presents Saturday &UR;  &LR; night _ a national championship
to celebrate with his son and a third period full of memories for a
lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Goren, North Dakota's senior assistant captain and a third-round
draft pick of the Bruins in 1997, scored the tying goal, assisted
on the winner, and salted the national championship away with an
empty-netter, all in the final period at the Civic Center where the
Fighting Sioux beat Boston College, 4-2, for the NCAA title.
</P>
<P>
   Goren wound up as the country's leading goal scorer with 34 and
was named the NCAA tournament's Most Outstanding Player.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Playing in the NHL) will be great, whether it's Providence or
Boston,'' said the younger Goren, who met with Bruins assistant
general manager Mike O'Connell this week. ``Maybe I'll be back in
this building soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Goren, who played four seasons at Lake Superior State and
now owns a string of doughnut shops in Winnipeg, said the Bruins
have hinted they'd like to see his son in a Providence Bruins
uniform if that team can get to the second round of the upcoming
American Hockey League playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's in April or late summer training camp, said North
Dakota coach Dean Blais, the Bruins will find themselves with ``a
self-driven player. He worked hard all last summer lifting weights
and he wants to be a member of the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great leader in the dressing room and he's what you saw
tonight. He plays big in big games and he's done that all year
long. He's got a real knack for scoring.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Goren's tying goal, said BC coach Jerry York and captain
Mike Mottau, that gave the Fighting Sioux the fight to live up to
their nickname.
</P>
<P>
   ``That goal really energized them,'' said Mottau of Goren's
strike early in the third period. ``That was the turning point.''
</P>
<P>
   Goren, whose younger brothers were playing Saturday &UR;  &LR; night in
the Manitoba junior championships _ Chuck Goren was trying to find
a telephone just before midnight to check on that game _ joked that
after North Dakota's national championship win over BU in 1997 (he
was redshirted that year) and Saturday &UR;  &LR; night's victory, he wasn't
sure what kind of welcome he'd get in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But any player who can score in the clutch and carry a team on
his shoulders in the biggest game of his career will be more than
welcome in the Hub.
</P>
<P>
   Goren, who hit a post and was also stopped by BC goalie Scott
Clemmensen on a breakway, said of his early frustration
Saturday &UR;  &LR; night, ``I was wondering if I could shoot the puck in the
ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   And he wasn't thinking about passing BC's Brian Gionta (33
goals) with his empty-netter for the national goal scoring lead.
``The important thing was that we got four and they got two,'' said
Goren, ``and that I couldn't have given my dad a better 50th
birthday present. One of the reasons I came to North Dakota was
that it was close to Winnipeg and my parents could come to see me
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Goren said he worked on his entire game to get ready for what
turned out to be a championship season. ``Like the team, we got
better and better as the year went on. Last year, BC beat us in the
regionals. We owed them and we wanted them. They put a sour feeling
in our gut last year and we wanted to do the same thing to them
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   But what was sour for the Eagles was oh-so-birthday-cake sweet
for Lee and Chuck Goren. ``Dad had me playing hockey when I was 3
years old,'' said Lee, ``and I'm so glad he was here tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Goren said he was happy for his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a way to go out. What a terrific feeling for Lee. Now, he
wants to play for Boston,'' said the proud father. ``I think
everything will work out in the next week or so and we're excited.
He (Mike O'Connell) would like to see Lee play in Providence this
year and if they get into the second round, I'm sure Lee will be
here to help them. Hopefully he'll be moving to Boston later in
May. We all want him to be a Boston Bruin.''
</P>
<P>
   If he helps the Baby B's and the parent club like he lifted his
Sioux mates Saturday &UR;  &LR; night, then Goren will be the people's choice
in Boston as well as in Grand Forks, N.D.

TEAM USA ROLLS INTO FINAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MISSISSAUGA, Ontario _ Thanks to Team USA's 7-1 win over Sweden
and Canada's 3-2 edge over Finland in Saturday's semifinals, the
United States and Canada will face off Sunday night for the sixth
time in the final game of the World Championship of women's ice
hockey. Since 1990, when the tournament began, no other team has
ever been on the ice with the world title at stake. Finland is
getting better; Sweden, too. But when everything's on the line,
it's still ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' vs. ``O Canada''
</P>
<P>
   The United States is getting a little tired of the latter.
Although the team brought home the Olympic gold medal, Team USA
players have yet to earn the right to call themselves world
champions. Five title games against Canada, five losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still hungry,'' said captain Cammi Granato, the only US
player who has been around since the beginning. ``We haven't
achieved a gold (at worlds) yet. That's something we really want
under our belts.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the United States has beaten Canada only once in eight
tries since returning from Nagano, a 4-1 win in an exhibition this
February. But that was before the return of the gold-medal twins.
Yes, the Sara/hs are back. For the first time since the Olympic
triumph, goaltenders and friends Sarah Tueting and Sara DeCosta
have been reunited, and hopes are high that their experience,
poise, skill and chemistry will provide the yeast this team needs
to rise to the challenge. Their timing couldn't be better,
especially coupled with the absence of defenseman Tara Mounsey,
recovering from ACL surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just having those two back in net is a real security for us,''
said Granato. ``They're both so talented. Sara DeCosta is one of
most sound goalies technically I've ever seen play the game, and
Sarah Tueting is the biggest-game player.''
</P>
<P>
   Although each has played in a few international games since
Nagano, circumstances have kept the Sara/hs apart. Tueting, one
class away from her degree at Dartmouth, took a year's break from
hockey , while DeCosta returned to Providence College and devoted
herself to playing for the Friars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made the decision to play for Providence and I felt I had a
loyalty to them,'' said DeCosta, whose 62 saves in a
double-overtime loss against Dartmouth in the quarterfinals of last
month's ECAC tournament may have been her last for the Friars
despite another year of eligibility. The 22-year-old from Warwick,
R.I., hopes to instead be gearing up for 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``If given the opportunity to play at this level and go on tour,
that's definitely what I'm going to do,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for Tueting, now more than ever. After deciding
she wasn't yet ready to give up hockey, the 23-year-old premed
student rejoined the US squad only to sprain her left ankle so
badly in a December exhibition game against Harvard that she missed
11 weeks of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a long winter,'' she said. ``I did a lot of time in the
pool. I felt like I was training for the Summer Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Sara/hs, roommates on this trip, are tickled to be back
together. As it was on the road to Nagano, they share net duty.
Asked after Saturday &UR;  &LR; night's win which netminder would start
against Canada _ they are each 2-0 in this tournament_ Smith
replied: ``You know the answer: Sara/h.''
</P>
<P>
   They were in there together in the gold-medal game in Nagano.
When starter Tueting took to the ice, she wore a good-luck angel
pin that had long been DeCosta's. Although Tueting tried to give it
back to her teammate afterward, it's still safely in her jewelry
box back home. ``It was a gift to her,'' said DeCosta. ``I'm sure
she'll use it the right way.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Tueting: ``We'll see come 2002 where it needs to go.''
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday &UR;  &LR; night's victory over Sweden, the United States got
off to a fast start when Alana Blahoski scored her sixth goal of
the tournament just 1:47 into the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``To come out of the first period 1-0 is kind of a concern,''
said Smith, ``because we gave them a foothold.''
</P>
<P>
   Team USA regained control with a three-goal second, however, and
was up 4-0 before Sweden ruined the shutout with a goal 4:43 into
the third before Krissy Wendell, Blahoski and Karyn Bye wrapped
things up for the United States. Stephanie O'Sullivan of Dorchester
notched two assists, giving her 12 points in four games.

RED SOX NIGHTMARE CONTINUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ No, Sox fans, it doesn't look any better in
the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Even after wiping the sleep from your eyes and chugging your
first cup of joe, there's no disguising the distressing events
taking place on the Left Coast while most of New England slumbers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite exhaustive efforts by an Anaheim bullpen seemingly
determined to give away a five-run lead, the Red Sox lost their
fourth straight game, 7-5, before a gathering of 27,369 in Edison
International Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, who trailed, 6-1, after six innings but had the tying
run on base in the eighth, are off to their worst start since 1996,
another season that began with exalted expectations. The Sons of
Kevin Kennedy, coming off a division title the year before, lost
their first five games and 12 of their first 14 to fall out of
contention by Patriots Day that year. The fallout from that season
included Kennedy's firing and Roger Clemens's exodus from Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The Sons of Jimy Williams, coming off back-to-back wild-card
appearances, have lost four in a row since an Opening Night win by
Pedro Martinez, who pitches again Sunday afternoon and will attempt
to keep the Sox from matching their longest losing streak of last
season, when they dropped five in a row in June.
</P>
<P>
   It will be up to Martinez to do what their other franchise
player, Nomar Garciaparra, has been unable to accomplish.
Garciaparra had a single in three trips and was robbed of another
by Angels shortstop Gary DiSarcina but is off to the worst start of
his four-year term with the Sox, one in which he is 0 for 6 with
runners in scoring position and batting .158 (3 for 19) overall.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox already have lost more games this season (2) to the
Angels than they did in all of '99, when they took 9 of 10 from the
fallen Halos. They haven't held a lead in the last 21 innings,
keeping the pressure on a shaky pitching staff that nevertheless
shouldn't take the blame for all that has gone south on this West
Coast swing.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox scored twice in both the seventh and eighth innings,
taking advantage of four walks. Jeff Frye, playing third base in
the absence of the injured John Valentin, singled home one run and
beat an attempted force play to set up another in the seventh,
which ended with Trot Nixon hitting a one-hop smash that Angels
rookie second baseman Adam Kennedy turned into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth, after Troy O'Leary had doused a two-on, no-out
rally by hitting into a double play, two-out hits by Carl Everett
(double) and Jason Varitek (single) drew the Sox to within 6-5. But
Lou Pote, the Angels' fifth pitcher, struck out Frye on three
pitches to end the inning, and the Angels added a run in the bottom
of the inning on Scott Spiezio's double and Benji Molina's single
off Sox reliever Rheal Cormier. ``We got a good guy going tomorrow,
but so do they,'' said Sox manager Jimy Williams, referring to
Angels righthander Kent Bottenfield, who won 18 games for St. Louis
last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we battled back in the latter part of the game and we'll
take that into tomorrow's game. We haven't been scoring runs (10 in
the first four games) and we scored five tonight. Good things can
happen, but we've got to make them happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox were down, 2-0, after one inning Saturday &UR;  &LR; night, with
Mo Vaughn contributing an opposite-field, 0-2 RBI single to put
Brian Rose in an early hole. The Sox came into the game with just
four hits in 30 at-bats with runners in scoring position. That
number didn't change through the first five innings against Lynn's
Ken Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, coming off a season in which he won just four games and
had persistent elbow trouble, took a one-hitter into the sixth,
when the Sox finally broke through when Jose Offerman drew a
two-out walk, took second on a wild pitch, and hustled home when
Angels second baseman Adam Kennedy made a diving stop of Nixon's
grounder but saw the ball pop out of his glove as Offerman never
broke stride.
</P>
<P>
   But Rose was bounced in the sixth, when Garret Anderson singled,
Troy Glaus doubled him home, and Spiezio followed with a two-home
run home run that made it 5-1.

HILL, ERSTAD DELIVER FOR ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- Going into the season, two of the Angels' biggest
question marks were Ken Hill and Darin Erstad. So far, Hill and
Erstad have been more like exclamation points.
</P>
<P>
   Hill and Erstad continued their early-season successes Saturday
night, helping the Angels to a 7-5 victory over the Boston Red Sox
before 27,369 at Edison Field. It was the Angels' third win in a
row, and put them in a tie for first in the A.L. West with the
Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Significant because the Angels haven't had a share of the top
spot in the division since last April 17. At 3-2, it's the first
time the Angels have been over .500 since last April 16 (6-5).
</P>
<P>
   The Angels survived a late-inning rally by the Red Sox against
the Angels bullpen, but Troy Percival pitched the ninth for his
first save.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've made a statement to the league,'' Percival said.
``We've shown we're not going to be pushovers. We're going to play
hard for nine innings.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they felt the same way last season before the
injuries hit. Shortstop Gary DiSarcina, who missed half of last
season with a broken bone in his forearm, had to leave Saturday's
game after the seventh inning with a bruised left thumb. He
sustained the injury knocking down a smash by Nomar Garciaparra in
the second inning. Angels manager Mike Scioscia said DiSarcina will
not start today.
</P>
<P>
   What has made Hill a question mark for the Angels is his
arthritic right elbow. But Hill's performances in his first two
starts have shown his elbow is fine for now.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, he gave up one run and two hits in six innings while
making 98 pitches. He struggled a little with his control, walking
five. But otherwise controlled the game, using his splitter
effectively.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his opening-night start against the Yankees, Hill
(1-1) has given up three runs and six hits in 11 1/3 innings (2.38
ERA).
</P>
<P>
   ``The last couple of years, my biggest problem has been locating
pitches,'' Hill said. ``But when my arm's healthy I'm able to do
it. Now I'm healthy -- knock on wood.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Erstad was a question mark because he had struggled
miserably since making the All-Star team in 1998. Last season he
hit only .253, after hitting .299 and .296 in his first two full
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Erstad went 3 for 5 to raise his batting average to a
league-leading .583 (14 for 24). He singled twice, doubled, drove
in a run and scored another.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad led off the bottom of the first with a single, the fourth
time in five games he's led off the game for the Angels with a hit.
After a walk by Adam Kennedy, Mo Vaughn singled to left field to
score Erstad for a 1-0 Angels lead. Garret Anderson drove in the
second run of the inning with a fielder's choice.
</P>
<P>
   Hill took a shutout into the sixth, and got two quick outs. But
two walks, two wild pitches and a single resulted in a run.
However, he got out of the inning by getting Garciaparra on a
flyout to left with two runners on.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get a guy of Garciaparra's stature after being out there
that long in that inning showed me a lot,'' Scioscia said.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels increased their lead with four runs in the bottom of
the sixth, including an RBI double by Troy Glaus, and a two-run
homer by Scott Spiezio, his first as an Angel. Erstad doubled in
the fourth run of the inning for a 6-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox scored two runs in the seventh off the Angels
bullpen, but it could have been worse. Kent Mercker and Shigetoshi
Hasegawa combined to walk three and give up two hits, but Hasegawa
got out of it by getting Nixon to hit into an inning-ending double
play with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox added two more runs off Mark Petkovsek in the eighth
on a couple of two-out hits -- Everett's RBI double and Jason
Varitek's RBI single. But Lou Pote came in and struck out Jeff Frye
on three pitches to end the inning.

TICKET SALE POSTPONED AFTER MELEE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDITORS: Detailed information about the new playoff ticket sale
procedure is at the bottom of the second take of this story. Note
that the new procedure will start next weekend when the sales
suspension is lifted.) 
(This story is moving in the ``a'' national news file, the ``s''
sports news file and in the ``n'' California news file.) 
By JENNIFER HAMM  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Playoff fever broke into a cold sweat when a melee
erupted among 1,500 excited Lakers fans at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of police in riot gear were called to the center Saturday
to calm a crowd that became hysterical after the ticket sales
process turned chaotic. Police and Staples Center officials decided
selling tickets could make the unruly crowd dangerous, and sales
were suspended throughout the Los Angeles area.
</P>
<P>
   One man was arrested and dozens of people suffered cuts and
scrapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on the ground getting trampled,'' said Glendale resident
Joe Briones, 18, who arrived at Staples Center before dawn.
``People were getting crushed. I was moving and my feet weren't
even on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials announced sales will resume next Sunday at 10 a.m.
with a new procedure to guarantee order.
</P>
<P>
   Staples Center president Timothy J. Leiweke took no
responsibility for the problems Saturday, saying only that the
arena was supporting the Lakers' efforts to eliminate brokers from
hoarding playoff tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We regret that these efforts caused an inconvenience for the
fans,'' Leiweke said in a statement. ``However, we will continue to
have zero tolerance for ticket brokers and their ability to profit
from faithful fans.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers declined to comment Saturday, noting it is Staples
Center that is selling the playoff tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday wasn't the first time Staples Center has had difficulty
accommodating customers since its opening. Another ticket-line
snafu delayed opening night in the fall; slow ticket distribution
at the will-call office kept the Bruce Springsteen and the E Street
Band concert off the stage for an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The one-week Lakers ticket delay enraged fans eager to watch the
team, which has the NBA's top record, pursue its best shot at a
national title in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers fans, many of whom waited overnight for tickets that
included every round, blamed Staples Center officials, saying not
enough was done to keep the crowd organized and calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made it total chaos,'' said Danny Johnson, 38, of
Palmdale.
</P>
<P>
   Staples Center officials spent most of the day assessing what
went wrong and how to make next weekend go smoother.
</P>
<P>
   Problems began to develop early Saturday as Lakers fans lined up
along the perimeter of the parking lot, waiting to get a hand
stamp. The stamp would entitle them to receive a ticket with a
random number that would determine their place in line.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said that hours before tickets were set to go on sale,
two Staples Center officials announced from the center of the
parking lot that everyone in line should come to them to receive a
stamp.
</P>
<P>
   That triggered a mob rush as eager fans pushed and clawed their
way to receive the stamp, the witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   The witnesses said an attempt to distribute the random-number
tickets angered the crowd even more when an official threw the
tickets up in the air.
</P>
<P>
   There was another frenzy as fans dove for the small pieces of
paper, leaving many with cuts and scrapes on their arms and legs.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Police Department officers were called in to calm
the crowd. Some 40 officers in riot gear marched in and formed
lines in front of the Staples Center entrance, said Sgt. Dave
Nunez.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Staples Center didn't have the ticket sales in an orderly
manner,'' said Nunez. ``We came to restore the peace ... because
the crowd was so disorderly.''
</P>
<P>
   Although most fans formed an orderly line that stretched around
the side of the arena, a large group of unruly fans at the front of
the line demanded to know how tickets would be sold.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd began chanting ``We want tickets'' and ``Staples
Center sucks'' when it was announced ticket sales would be delayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very upset. It's an injustice,'' said Denise Hall, 41, of
Los Angeles. ``You get down here and you can't purchase tickets.
It's outrageous.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL 2ND TAKE FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &LR; Hall had promised her two sons that she would get them playoff
tickets. She woke up at 5 a.m. to go to Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Just after 10 a.m., police instructed the crowd to leave but
many remained until baton-wielding officers marched toward them.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles radio reporter Eoin Montemayor of KLAC was hit by a
baton, struck back at officers and was cited at the scene on
suspicion of battery on an officer, police said.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Playoff fever broke into a cold sweat when a melee
erupted among 1,500 excited Lakers fans at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of police in riot gear were called to the center Saturday
to calm a crowd that became hysterical after the ticket sales
process turned chaotic. Police and Staples Center officials decided
selling tickets could make the unruly crowd dangerous, and sales
were suspended throughout the Los Angeles area.
</P>
<P>
   One man was arrested and dozens of people suffered cuts and
scrapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on the ground getting trampled,'' said Glendale resident
Joe Briones, 18, who arrived at Staples Center before dawn.
``People were getting crushed. I was moving and my feet weren't
even on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials announced sales will resume next Sunday at 10 a.m.
with a new procedure to guarantee order.
</P>
<P>
   Staples Center president Timothy J. Leiweke took no
responsibility for the problems Saturday, saying only that the
arena was supporting the Lakers' efforts to eliminate brokers from
hoarding playoff tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We regret that these efforts caused an inconvenience for the
fans,'' Leiweke said in a statement. ``However, we will continue to
have zero tolerance for ticket brokers and their ability to profit
from faithful fans.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers declined to comment Saturday, noting it is Staples
Center that is selling the playoff tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday wasn't the first time Staples Center has had difficulty
accommodating customers since its opening. Another ticket-line
snafu delayed opening night in the fall; slow ticket distribution
at the will-call office kept the Bruce Springsteen and the E Street
Band concert off the stage for an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The one-week Lakers ticket delay enraged fans eager to watch the
team, which has the NBA's top record, pursue its best shot at a
national title in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers fans, many of whom waited overnight for tickets that
included every round, blamed Staples Center officials, saying not
enough was done to keep the crowd organized and calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made it total chaos,'' said Danny Johnson, 38, of
Palmdale.
</P>
<P>
   Staples Center officials spent most of the day assessing what
went wrong and how to make next weekend go smoother.
</P>
<P>
   Problems began to develop early Saturday as Lakers fans lined up
along the perimeter of the parking lot, waiting to get a hand
stamp. The stamp would entitle them to receive a ticket with a
random number that would determine their place in line.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said that hours before tickets were set to go on sale,
two Staples Center officials announced from the center of the
parking lot that everyone in line should come to them to receive a
stamp.
</P>
<P>
   That triggered a mob rush as eager fans pushed and clawed their
way to receive the stamp, the witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   The witnesses said an attempt to distribute the random-number
tickets angered the crowd even more when an official threw the
tickets up in the air.
</P>
<P>
   There was another frenzy as fans dove for the small pieces of
paper, leaving many with cuts and scrapes on their arms and legs.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Police Department officers were called in to calm
the crowd. Some 40 officers in riot gear marched in and formed
lines in front of the Staples Center entrance, said Sgt. Dave
Nunez.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Staples Center didn't have the ticket sales in an orderly
manner,'' said Nunez. ``We came to restore the peace ... because
the crowd was so disorderly.''
</P>
<P>
   Although most fans formed an orderly line that stretched around
the side of the arena, a large group of unruly fans at the front of
the line demanded to know how tickets would be sold.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd began chanting ``We want tickets'' and ``Staples
Center sucks'' when it was announced ticket sales would be delayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very upset. It's an injustice,'' said Denise Hall, 41, of
Los Angeles. ``You get down here and you can't purchase tickets.
It's outrageous.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL 2ND TAKE FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &LR; Hall had promised her two sons that she would get them playoff
tickets. She woke up at 5 a.m. to go to Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Just after 10 a.m., police instructed the crowd to leave but
many remained until baton-wielding officers marched toward them.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles radio reporter Eoin Montemayor of KLAC was hit by a
baton, struck back at officers and was cited at the scene on
suspicion of battery on an officer, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the problem at Staples Center, thousands of Lakers
fans throughout Southern California were turned away from ticket
retailers.

   ELIAN _ WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department ``would be
prepared'' to order Juan Miguel Gonzalez to remain in the United
States with his son Elian while courts determine custody rights,
Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder said Sunday. Also Sunday, the
father met with a government-appointed team of psychologists and
with Florida fishermen representing Elian's Miami relatives. The
relatives reportedly were preparing new court action Monday as an
expected midweek deadline to turn over the boy approached. (Lipman,
Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   ABDUCTED-CHILDREN _ When Amy Habie of Boca Raton turns on the
television and sees thousands of demonstrators in Havana demanding
the return of Elian Gonzalez, her heart aches. Elian's case reminds
Habie of how her ex-husband took their young twins to Guatemala
eight years ago and never returned. ``If our government made even
one-tenth the noise that the Cuban government is making, I think I
would have had my kids back,'' Habie said. Officials in the Elian
case say returning the boy to Cuba would advance their goal of
reuniting American parents with abducted children abroad.

forced into a runoff. (Cox News Service).

   IRS _ WASHINGTON _ Tax attorney Daren Larsen recently
represented a prosperous professional who owed the Internal Revenue
Service more than $100,000 dating back to his younger, wilder
years. To her client's delight, the IRS concluded that he could not
pay the total within the prescribed three-year period, so they
dropped the case. Welcome to the kinder, gentler IRS, two years
after passage of the most sweeping reform in half a century.

   UGA-FRAT _ His relatives told him horror stories about what they
went through in college to get into fraternities, so UGA student
Brian Harbin of Atlanta chose one that wouldn't haze him. ``Why
would you want to be a brother with someone who paddled you or made
you clean the toilets at 3 a.m.?'' he asked. Talk with fraternity
members and they're likely to divulge little about what they go
through to earn their stripes as pledges, and police and college
officials only know about hazing when something bad happens, like a
student winds up in the hospital with alcohol poisoning. Despite
claims that they are cracking down, and assurances that they have
taken a zero tolerance on hazing, incidents like the prank that
wound up killing popular UGA frat boy Ben Grantham last month seem
to pop up a couple of times a year. (Salzer, Atlanta

   DRUGS-MORENO _ Linda Moreno went to see her doctor to lose
weight four years ago. Today her lawyers expect her to die soon
from the side effects of the once popular drug combination
fen-phen. Her lawsuit against the makers and sellers of the ``fen''
in fen-phen alleges they engaged in illegal and unethical marketing

   WACO, Texas _ Before they step up to the counter to order their
chicken sandwiches and french fries, customers at Chick-fil-A are
greeted by Ethel Beard's warm smile and kind words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, welcome to Chick-Fil-A. How are you today?'' she says
as restaurant patrons walk in the double glass doors.
</P>
<P>
   The 63-year-old woman, whom employees and regular customers
affectionately call, ``Miss Ethel,'' has worked as the restaurant's
hostess for almost three years. She says that unlike most folks her
age, who look forward to retiring and kicking up their feet, she'd
rather be busy on hers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just not a house person,'' she said. In fact, she plans to
work five to 10 more years.
</P>
<P>
   The money she earns working full time helps her live more
comfortably than relying solely on Social Security or disability,
which she started receiving after suffering three strokes, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Seniors like Beard who want to work past age 65 will no longer
face a reduction in Social Security benefits, thanks to a new law
that President Clinton signed Friday. The law, approved unanimously
in both houses of Congress, eliminates the earnings test for
working seniors between the ages of 65 and 69, retroactively to
Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security earnings test was designed to discourage
older Americans from continuing to work by reducing their benefits
as they earned more. Under the policy, the roughly 800,000 people
ages 65-69 who worked and received Social Security benefits saw
their benefits cut $1 for every $3 they earned above $17,000;
benefits were reduced to zero if they earned more than about
$52,595.
</P>
<P>
   Those seniors whose benefits were withheld under the earnings
test will receive them in next month's Social Security checks.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating the earnings test will not only benefit seniors who
want to work, but also the employers who hire them.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Swift, project director for the AARP Foundation/Senior
Community Service Employment Program, said lifting the penalty
should increase the pool of qualified job applicants for employers
because it will encourage more seniors to apply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it should certainly provide more experienced workers
to the marketplace and perhaps help businesses in filling some
vacancies they have in the labor market that they have currently,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The AARP employment program helps seniors find jobs and leads
employers to seniors looking for jobs. Swift said she expects to
see more people in her office, enticed by the fact that they no
longer have to watch what they earn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most (seniors who want to work) have been reluctant to take
full-time positions or approach it if it's going to put them over
(the earnings limit),'' she said. ``For a lot of people it's really
going to make it easier because for many of them, Social Security
isn't an amount they can live on comfortably.''

 &HT;    Mandolin maker has spare time on a happy note
 &HT;    By Bill Osinski
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JEFFERSON, Ga. _ First thing in the morning, Tony Ianuario has a
chat with his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Shall we do some crafty woodworking today? Shall we make music?
Shall we be scientific? Or artistic?
</P>
<P>
   Frequently, he and his hands can't pick a single discipline for
the day. So, they decide to do them all by building mandolins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a fascinating thing to get a note from a piece of
wood,'' said Ianuario.
</P>
<P>
   On weekdays, Ianuario is an engineer, working as a county
utilities inspector. All other times, he and his hands are doing
something around the Victorian house he restored in Jefferson,
where he lives with his wife, Ann.
</P>
<P>
   Ianuario has been making mandolins for only about seven years.
But his instruments are good enough to have been picked by none
other than the late bluegrass music legend Bill Monroe. Also,
Ianuario has caught the eye of Colorado-based photographer Jack
Jacobson, who spent more than two years traveling the country
photographing musical instrument makers for his recently published
book, ``Heart &AMP; Hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Ianuario is one of 18 Georgia artisans among the approximately
250 Jacobson photographed during the project. The Smithsonian
Institution is sponsoring a traveling exhibit of Jacobson's works,
and the first stop is the Georgia Mountains History Museum in
Gainesville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   For most of his life, Ianuario has been aware he has the gift of
being able to visualize something and then just make it with his
hands.
</P>
<P>
   He still isn't totally sure how he came to focus his skills on
the mandolin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had the passion of wanting to build a fine instrument
for myself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, it could have been in his genes all along. He recently
learned that his paternal grandfather brought a mandolin with him
when he left his native Italy to come to America.
</P>
<P>
   What Ianuario does know is he's always enjoyed old-style country
music. After dabbling with playing and restoring guitars and
fiddles, he was captivated by the beauty of the shape and sound of
the mandolin.
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps the most complicated and ornate of the stringed
instruments. There are simply no flat surfaces to a mandolin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a piece of sculpture almost,'' Ann Ianuario said. ``And
Tony is an artist.''
</P>
<P>
   Ianuario starts with a single block of wood for the instrument's
top. He saws it into the basic shape, with two or three pointed
curls and a graceful scroll near the neck. Then he carves to get
the varying thicknesses he wants in different parts of the surface
and uses a series of small planes _ tools as small as an inch or 2
long _ to smooth them.
</P>
<P>
   Ianuario took the second mandolin he made to a bluegrass music
festival, where he invited Monroe to play it. After the master had
tested it, he told Ianuario that it was indeed a fine instrument,
worthy of keeping. Some of the onlookers immediately offered to buy
the mandolin Monroe had played, but Ianuario still has it.
</P>
<P>
   It takes Ianuario about four months to make a mandolin, and he
prices those he sells at $3,000 to $4,000. But making his craft
into a full-time business has never appealed much to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want people to play my instruments,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That sort of disregard for the commercial is something that
Jacobson found over and over as he visited the artisans and
photographed them for his book.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are people who are passionate about what they do,''
Jacobson said. ``They put their hearts and their hands into what
they do. They have devoted their lives to their crafts.''
</P>
<P>
   The inspiration for the ``Heart &AMP; Hands'' project came from
Jacobson's youth, when his clarinet teacher, Glen Johnston, allowed
him to join jam sessions of the musicians who came to Johnston's
instrument repair shop. Jacobson made a documentary film about
Johnston, ``The Mouthpiece Man.''
</P>
<P>
   About four years ago, Jacobson decided to seek out more
instrument makers. He spent about two years and put about 90,000
miles on his car as he journeyed to make the photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the instrument makers he photographed are people who
receive little recognition and minimal financial rewards, for all
their highly refined skills, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are unsung heroes of our country,'' he said.
``It's extremely important that we honor them as the national
treasures that they are.''

<P>
   CHILD-WARRIORS (Suan Phum, Thailand) _ Between them, the
12-year-old twins command 400,000 invisible soldiers. If anybody
shoots at them, the bullets just bounce off. And they can kill
their enemies simply by pointing a rifle at the ground and
concentrating really hard. It sounds like the fantasy of a million
schoolboys. But it is a belief that has led grown men into battle
behind the two child warriors who lead a ragged ethnic insurgency
called God's Army, just across the border in Myanmar, the former
Burma. By Seth Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   SKOREA-LIVESTOCK-VIRUS (Kumpari, South Korea) _ An infectious
outbreak in South Korea has taken on all the seriousness of a
national emergency. The threat that has gripped South Korea is
foot-and-mouth disease, one of the most destructive cattle diseases
known. And with critical national elections set for this week, the
government has pulled out all the stops to limit the damage _ not
only to agriculture, but to its political support as well. By

case.
</P>
<P>
   CUBAN-BOY-EXILES (Miami) _ ``Libertad.'' The word lords over
Elian Gonzalez's house in Little Havana. It is the first word that
rolls off people's tongues as they try to answer the questions so
many outside the Cuban community have been asking. Why so much
outrage? Why so much consternation over the fate of a little boy
whom most of them have never met? Why keep a boy from his father?
By Lizette Alvarez.
</P>
<P>
   RAMPAGE-KILLERS-II (Undated) _ Shots explode at a school in
Oregon or a brokerage office in Atlanta, and the nation is witness
to a sudden violent rampage. The killers' neighbors and families
submit to interviews, and inevitably, they say: ``He just
snapped.'' But the killers do not ``just snap.'' An examination by
The New York Times of 100 rampage murders found that most of the
killers spiraled down a long slow slide, mentally and emotionally.
Most of them left a road map of red flags. But in case after case,
the warning signs were missed. Second of four parts. By Laurie
Goodstein and William Glaberson.

 &HT;    UNLOVED TAX AGENCY PUTS ON A SMILE, BUT STILL MAKES GOOFS
 &HT;    With IRS-DATA.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Tax attorney Daren Larsen recently represented a
prosperous professional who owed the Internal Revenue Service more
than $100,000 dating back to his younger, wilder years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's single, makes $10-12 grand a month and has few
expenses,'' said Larsen, who works in Camarillo, Calif. ``The IRS
guys should be salivating over a guy like this.''
</P>
<P>
   But they weren't. To her client's delight, the IRS concluded
that he could not pay the total within the prescribed three-year
period, so they dropped the case. His tax debt was reclassified as
uncollectible.
</P>
<P>
   Larsen, who worked at the IRS for 13 years, was amazed. ``They
could have garnisheed his pay, but they didn't,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the kinder, gentler IRS, two years after passage of
the most sweeping reform in half a century.
</P>
<P>
   The reform act provided new taxpayer rights, an independent
overseer board and the establishment of a separate IRS taxpayer
advocate office.
</P>
<P>
   The agency now seizes property only rarely, audits a declining
percentage of returns, and teaches more of its employees to have
cheerful telephone voices and to refer to taxpayers as ``our
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   It also collected $2 billion less in delinquent taxes last year
than in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these results will be examined at a House Government
Reform subcommittee hearing Monday and at a three-day House
Republican tax reform ``summit'' starting Tuesday, during the week
that taxpayers are filling in the last lines of their 1040 forms
for the April 17 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   So far, reviews of the IRS overhaul have been mixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give them about a B,'' said Rep. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, chief
House sponsor of the reform act, whose chief goal was more
protection for taxpayers. ``We're still on track to get a new IRS,
but we're not there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, the agency has a huge backlog of requests under the
new ``innocent spouse'' rules. As of last fall, the agency had
41,000 claims for relief from taxes incurred by former spouses.
</P>
<P>
   As for the decline in collection of back taxes, Portman said
that is not the fault of reform. ``There is no inconsistency in
better service and compliance,'' he said. ``They work together.
That's the challenge over the next couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Taxpayers Union, a private watchdog group, gives
the IRS some credit for progress. Spokesman Pete Sepp said the
group's grade for the IRS has moved from F to C-minus. Complaints
to his group about abusive tax agents have dropped by at least
half, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, bureaucratic mistakes continue to plague the IRS and
its ``customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Huffine, an Atlanta cellular phone consultant, was trying
to buy a house early last year when a credit check discovered that,
unknown to him, the IRS had filed a lien against him for unpaid
taxes dating back to 1987.
</P>
<P>
   A flurry of telephone calls and letters over the next 15 months
produced contradictory information. During one call to an IRS
toll-free number, he was told the lien had been removed. Next, he
was told that the $3,868 debt was still on his record and that he
also owed $6,673 in interest and penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Huffine said the IRS had not notified him of the mounting debt.
In fact, the IRS had sent him three tax refunds. ``Impossible,''
one IRS representative told him. Yet the next day, Huffine found
another refund check in his mail.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantan has now paid the original bill, but he is fighting
the rest of the charges in the newly strengthened IRS office of the
national taxpayer advocate.
</P>
<P>
   Such mix-ups are plentiful in the IRS's bureaucratic maze of
100,000 far-flung employees and a 1960s computer system that dates
to the Jurassic era of data processing.
</P>
<P>
   A recent audit by the U.S. General Accounting Office, the
investigating arm of Congress, found that it sometimes took as long
as 10 years to record a taxpayer's payments. On the other hand, the
IRS sent a $15,000 refund to a person who owed $350,000 in back
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   IRS Commissioner Charles O. Rossotti has been quick to
acknowledge such problems.
</P>
<P>
   In candid testimony last month to a Senate committee, he
conceded that ``we are not yet meeting the legitimate service
expectations for the vast majority of compliant taxpayers who
voluntarily pay their taxes, while compliance activity, such as
examination coverage and collection enforcement activity, is
dropping rapidly, thus potentially undermining the fairness of the
whole tax system.''
</P>
<P>
   Rossotti blames the problems on cuts in IRS personnel dating
back to 1993, the shift of enforcement staff to taxpayer assistance
work, and the outmoded computer system, which will take an
estimated eight more years to replace. He is asking Congress for as
many as 10,000 new workers for the agency.
</P>
<P>
   His frankness has won praise.
</P>
<P>
   However, Portman and others worry that Rossotti's reforms may
not become permanent, especially since an independent board of
overseers, a key element of the 1998 act, is still not activated.
President Clinton was more than a year late in finalizing the
board's nominees, and confirmation has hit a snag in the Senate
over an unrelated dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Other critics of the IRS question how much progress Rossotti can
make under the current tax law.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a courageous, thoughtful man'' who has a ``sensible''
reorganization plan, said Michael J. Graetz, a Yale University law
professor and author of the book ``The Decline (and Fall?) of the
Income Tax.''
</P>
<P>
   But Graetz added that the problem lies with the 2,840-page tax
code and its 46,000 pages of rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that you are going to completely restructure the IRS
without changing the basic tax law that they've got to administer
is like thinking you can turn a Winnebago around without taking it
out of the garage. It just can't be done.''

 &HT;    EDS: This is part of the series The Human, Wired: PART IV
 &HT;    Through computers, mankind pursues age-old forbidden fruit
 &HT;    By Jay Bookman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Barely 50 years after its invention, the computer is
already listed with the wheel, the printing press and the steam
engine as a technology that has changed the world.
</P>
<P>
   Like the printing press, the computer has greatly accelerated
the flow of information. Like the steam engine, the computer can be
applied to a variety of industrial uses, making the entire economy
more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   But in its impact on how human beings live, the computer is best
compared to a humble technology called the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Like the computer, the clock simply generates information _ in
its case, the time of day _ and shares that information with a
large number of people. Yet historians credit the clock as one of
the most influential inventions of all time, because it changed the
human mind-set. Its unique power lay in its ability to synchronize
millions of human beings, to create out of many independent
individuals one smoothly functioning organism.
</P>
<P>
   Without the clock it would be impossible to agree to meet a
client at 3:30, or get to work by 8 a.m., or know that ``Frasier''
would be broadcast at 9 p.m. The clock has given us all a common
framework, and in the process has become our conductor. We humans
are mere members of its orchestra, playing to its beat.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the computer is doing as well. In the next few
years, as it transitions from a large, stationary object to
something that many of us carry around throughout the day, the
computer will make us more accountable to each other, more
connected. Through its various and intertwined communications media
_ e-mail, the Internet, cell phones, etc. _ it will synchronize
human activities far more closely, and in many more ways, than the
clock ever has. We will each become a node in a wireless, highly
synchronized network, sending and receiving electronic information
almost constantly.
</P>
<P>
   Just what you needed, huh?
</P>
<P>
   And that's only the beginning. As a catalyst for change, the
computer's potential is almost limitless, and the transformations
it has caused to date are relatively minor compared to what the
future holds. After all, the computer was designed to mimic, extend
and eventually challenge the most potent force for change on the
planet: human intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Most scientists seeking to create some form of artificial
intelligence explain their goals in relatively practical,
nonthreatening terms. They want to make computers smarter, and thus
more useful. They want to use computers to help human beings who
have been paralyzed by disease or accidents. They want to build
computers that feel less mechanical and more friendly to their
human users. Each of those goals is feasible. Each offers real-life
practical benefits to human beings.
</P>
<P>
   But there's also something deeper going on.
</P>
<P>
   Author John Horgan, in his 1996 book ``The End of Science,''
argued that the days of discovery are largely over. Scientists have
pretty much explained the secrets of the world around us, he wrote,
leaving little to be explored or explained. And while he has a
point, the two largest questions, the puzzles that have dogged
human beings for eons, remain unanswered in scientific terms.
</P>
<P>
   Big questions typically come in stark little packages. In this
case, the two biggies can each be expressed in three words:
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are we?''
</P>
<P>
   ``What is 'life'?''
</P>
<P>
   When you talk to scientists in their laboratories, when you read
the journals and look at the work they're doing, it gradually
becomes clear that at some level, perhaps even an unconscious one,
this is what they're really after. They're trying to understand
life and consciousness, and in science you do that most
convincingly by creating life and consciousness artificially.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing new about that impulse. Mankind has always had
the drive to create, to try to mimic if not duplicate the Godlike
power to give life. Cro-Magnon man drew lifelike images of his prey
on cave walls. Medieval Jewish mystics told the story of the Golem,
a creature molded out of clay by a powerful rabbi and then given
the breath of life. In the 18th century, inventors used the new art
of mechanics to build lifelike animals that moved and behaved like
their real-life counterparts, even to the extent of eating food and
excreting waste.
</P>
<P>
   The pioneering work in robotics, artificial intelligence and
other computer-related fields is a modern expression of that
ancient drive. So is research by scientists in other fields.
</P>
<P>
   Geneticists at the Institute of Genomic Research in Maryland,
for example, recently announced that they had isolated the 300 or
so genes essential to build a simple bacteria. They intend to
fabricate those 300 genes from scratch out of manmade chemicals,
then combine them within an artificial cell wall. The result would
be a new form of life created entirely by the hand of man.
</P>
<P>
   Such developments send a chill down the spines of many people.
That's not surprising. We may be compelled to re-create life, but
we're terrified at the thought of succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   That fear takes several forms. Mary Shelley, in her classic
novel ``Frankenstein,'' captured the fear that technology will
somehow slip our control and turn against us. That story, published
in 1818, expresses a fear that has never gone away, and in fact has
grown more real over time.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Joy, the chief scientist of Sun Microsystems and one of the
most respected figures in Silicon Valley, echoes Shelley in the
cover piece of the April issue of Wired magazine. With fully
intelligent computers likely to arrive by 2030, with biotechnology,
genetics, cloning and robotics coming into full flower, ``We are on
the cusp of the further perfection of extreme evil,'' Joy writes.
</P>
<P>
   In the essay, Joy goes on to worry that his work, together with
the work of other scientists, could eventually enable ``the
construction of the technology that may replace our species.'' But
he offers no concrete means of avoiding that fate.
</P>
<P>
   Joy's article kicked off considerable controversy among those
who follow technology, with some of the most spirited debate taking
place in Internet chat rooms. While some participants reacted with
horror to the future he depicted, others greeted it with surprising
enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Humanity, as we know it, SHOULD become extinct,'' one person
wrote. ``We have spent the past 10,000 years adapting our
environment to suit our needs _ now it is time to take the final
step and make our minds and bodies as subject to our whims as our
outer world is. Since God does not exist, we shall have to become
him.''
</P>
<P>
   So technophobia, while widespread, clearly isn't universal.
</P>
<P>
   However, while technology may give human beings godlike powers,
it cannot give us the godlike wisdom and restraint we need to use
that power well. The problem was best expressed by social critic
Lewis Mumford.
</P>
<P>
   ``One does not make a child powerful by placing a stick of
dynamite in his hands,'' Mumford wrote in 1934. ``One only adds to
the danger of his irresponsibility.'' A little more than a decade
later, we had invented and used the atomic bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's the fear that in making machines more lifelike,
we threaten to dilute those traits that make humans special.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Foerst, a theologian who serves as a sort of spiritual
adviser to MIT's Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, professes a
certain puzzlement at that concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's curious how people insist on defining themselves as
unique, because that's apparently important to us,'' says Foerst.
``First, we said it was language that made us special. Then it
turned out that some of the higher forms of life, like the chimps,
could also communicate through language. So we turned to genes. But
it turns out that we share 99 percent of our genes with the chimps,
and even 50 percent with yeast. I love that fact.''
</P>
<P>
   With language and genes no longer defining us as special, Foerst
says, intelligence has become the last human bulwark. That may help
explain why people get so queasy at the idea of biocomputing, the
fusing of living brain cells with silicon to create a hybrid
computer. Scientists in that field are doing what human beings have
always done, taking what we find in nature and turning it to our
own purpose. From that perspective, using rat neurons to make a
computer should be no different than using cow leather to make
shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for most people, there's something instinctively unnatural
about linking life and silicon so intimately. It blurs the clear
demarcation between us and them, or more accurately, us and it.
</P>
<P>
   Foerst argues that the idea of human singularity will have to be
abandoned in the face of what's coming. Even the soul, she says, is
not something inherent in us as human beings, but rather something
that develops, ``an interactive quality between God and his
people,'' Foerst calls it. Machines too might somehow acquire a
soul, she speculates.
</P>
<P>
   While that seems extremely unlikely, Foerst's assertion does
illustrate the gravity of the questions now being raised.
</P>
<P>
   In debating the impact of technology, historians often cite
something called ``the technological imperative.'' It's the idea
that if something can be done, it will be done, that human beings
lack the discipline needed to turn our backs on a tempting but
dangerous new technology. We are always eager to reap the rewards
of progress, always eager to dismiss any danger as the price of
doing business.
</P>
<P>
   The sole exception to that imperative would seem to be atomic
weapons, and to a lesser degree biological and chemical weapons. In
those cases, the danger so outweights the benefit that as a species
we have agreed never to use such weapons again. And even then, with
the future of the planet potentially at stake, the consensus
against atomic weapons remains tenuous.
</P>
<P>
   Champions of progress point out that every generation since the
late 1700s has had its prophets of technological doom. For example,
doctors in the early 1800s warned that traveling faster than 25 mph
on steam-powered trains would endanger the human heart. With the
nagging exception of atomic weapons, every forecast of
technological doom since then has proved equally groundless.
</P>
<P>
   The same might be true _ is probably true _ about the dire fears
raised about the computer. In the next century, our great
grandchildren will probably look back at us and get a good chuckle
out of our silly little worries, just as we now chuckle at the good
doctors' warning about rail travel.
</P>
<P>
   It does seem reasonable to wonder, however.
</P>
<P>
   In our apparent compulsion to exercise Godlike powers over life
_ in our insistence that we too can endow our creations with
intelligence _ we're playing with things we cannot fully
comprehend. It all smacks of arrogance, and arrogance can reap a
bitter harvest.

   (NYT9) ALBANY, New York -- April 8, 2000 --
NY-ABORTION-ANNIVERSARY -- Thirty years ago this week, New York
state legalized abortion, adopting what was the most liberal law in
the country, three years before the Supreme Court made abortion
legal nationwide. New York Senator Roy M. Goodman, who spoke
against the ``butchery'' women endured in illicit abortions in
1970. (Chang W. Lee/The New York Times)

   (NYT8) LOS ANGELES -- April 8, 2000 -- DEMS-CONVENTION -- The
Democratic National Convention, to be held in Los Angeles in
August, seems to be shaping up as another disaster in the making.
Fund-raising was behind schedule, the billionaire moguls who helped
lure the convention were portrayed as bickering among themselves,
and the worst police corruption scandal in decades erupted which
sent the city's public officials into a kind of collective
meltdown. Noeila Rodriguez, who is now in charge of the host
committee for the Democratic convention, at the main office in
downtown Los Angeles. (Monica Almeida/The New York Times)

   (NYT7) WILLIAMSVILLE, N.Y. -- April 8, 2000 -- BUFFALO -- Once a
bustling home to 1.1 million people, Erie County, which includes
Buffalo and its suburbs, now has is now 926,000 and is shrinking
fast. Last year alone, more than 10,000 people moved away, leading
to one of the steepest population drops of any county in the
nation, according to new federal census estimates. On the
waterfront, glory had largely given way to contamination and
idleness. (Suzanne DeChillo/The New York Times)

<P>
   (NYT6) HACIENDA HEIGHTS, Calif. -- April 8, 2000 -- MEDICAL-INFO
-- A growing number of companies are adding specialized services to
help their employees navigate through the mass of medical
information available today. Beverly Fernandez was told in early
1999 that her son Dominic, now 4, needed immediate open heart
surgery and possibly a transplant. Having learned more through a
service provided by her employer, she chose to wait, and her son
did fine without a transplant. (Ed Carreon/The New York Times)
</P>
<P>
   (NYT5) SEATTLE -- April 8, 2000 -- EARTH-DAY -- Summoning the
will to confront global warming is the chief goal of the
Seattle-based Earth Day Network, which says the biggest rally in
this country on April 22 will be on the Mall in Washington. Dennis
Hayes, chairman of Earth Day, who has been with the organization

   (NYT4) LOS ANGELES -- April 8, 2000 -- CALIF-JANITORS-STRIKE --
Thousands of janitors in Los Angeles are on strike for higher pay
after rejecting a wage plan offered by building maintenance
companies. The strike came after janitors voted to reject a pay
plan put forward by a group of building maintenance companies that
would have offered a 50-cent raise the first year and 40-cent
raises the next two years. The workers seek a $3 increase in their
hourly pay over the next three years. (Monica Almeida/The New York

   (NYT3) WASHINGTON -- April 8, 2000 -- BUSH-REPUBS -- House
Republicans say they realize George W. Bush, shown with republican
senators last June, is a weaker candidate than they had hoped for.
Just as House Republicans are charting their own course, the Bush
campaign has made a tactical decision that it does not want to
march in lock step with the Republican-run Congress, trying to push
through a common legislative agenda. (Paul Hosefros/The New York

MONTENEGRO-AFTERSHOCKS-2 -- Surrounded on all sides of it's borders
with political tension, the people of Rozaje, Montenegro find not
only that they have received little thanks for their open-armed
welcome of Kosovo Albanians as NATO bombed Yugoslavia, but they
feel battered, financially poorer and still trapped by the
pressures of war. Vasvija Muric wonders what happened to her
husband, Dervis, a Montenegrin Muslim taxi driver who went on an
errand into Kosovo in July, 1999, with a friend. Both men vanished

only that they have received little thanks for their open-armed
welcome of Kosovo Albanians as NATO bombed Yugoslavia, but they
feel battered, financially poorer and still trapped by the

BIG NEWS ON LITTLE SCREENS 
BY FELICITY BARRINGER  
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: R.I., Tenn. Ga., Calif.)  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bob Egan, a technology research executive, sounds jaded when
asked to predict the future of news delivery on cellular phones and
hand-held computers. ``You are entering this story at the moment of
maximum hype,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But then there are moments like this: on Sunday, after missing
his daughter's high school softball game because of a business
trip, Egan turned on his Palm Pilot hand-held organizer on a
beachfront boardwalk in San Diego and pulled in the news of the
team's victory and the favorable reviews of his daughter's pitching
from The Woonsocket Call in Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   From America Online and Microsoft to Reuters and The Associated
Press to The New York Times, E.W. Scripps' Knoxville News-Sentinel
and Knight Ridder's MercuryCenter.com, news and information
organizations are bringing their wares to the diminutive screens of
portable electronic devices. The new medium is something between a
curiosity and a business, and the media groups involved, still
trying to find their financial sea legs on the Internet, are
hesitant to predict how these services will pay for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a widespread consensus that consumers will develop
a taste for getting up-to-the-minute data on traffic and movies and
sports and even news while they are on the go. ``The value here is
that people are going to be able to get at personal and relevant
information services when they are traveling,'' Egan, a vice
president of the Gartner Group, said. Traveling, he added, does not
have to be business travel _ it could be ``travel between the PTA
and work or driving the kids around.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of news on tiny screens _ some so small they can
accommodate only 30 words at a time, others able to handle as many
as 150 words _ has been drawing gradually nearer for a decade,
starting with paging devices that transmitted headlines and
financial data from organizations like CNN, Bloomberg News and
ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   But the popularity of cellular phones and personal organizers
like Palm Pilots is soaring just as new technologies arrive to
transform them into mini-printing presses. So large numbers of
investors, analysts, telecommunications companies and news
providers are becoming convinced that, eventually, people who
hunger for news will be happy to get it fresh in bit-sized digital
chunks whenever they need it.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Sacks, senior vice president and general manager of AOL
Interactive Services, said, ``You could go out of your mind
listening to Elian Gonzalez stories, when all you want to know is
why did you see 16 ambulances down the road from your house.''
</P>
<P>
   Providing the answer to such a question is the eventual goal of
services like those offered by America Online and Access Atlanta,
the flagship Web site of the Cox Enterprises unit Cox Interactive
Media. Providing a constantly updated digest of general news is the
current practice of USAToday.com, Yahoo, Fox Sports, ABCNews.com,
Reuters and The Associated Press. Providing up-to-the-minute news
of stock prices, mergers and new technologies is the aim of a
myriad of business and technology news services.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to hardware and software, the corporate guests at
the wireless information party could fill a fair-sized hotel
ballroom. But, as with the Internet, the entire wireless
information industry is casting about for an economic model that
works.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Zollman, an analyst for the Advanced Interactive Media
Group, sees a bright spot, however, in the fact that these services
are so new that relatively few people are accustomed to getting
them for free. ``There has come to be on the Web an expectation
that content is free,'' he said. ``On the wireless devices, that
expectation has not been set yet.''
</P>
<P>
   One possible revenue stream, he said, could develop by offering
wireless information services ``free or at a reduced rate to people
who subscribe to the print edition'' of a newspaper. Another, Egan
said, would be charging a cell phone user not by the number of
minutes connected but by services received.
</P>
<P>
   Making a business out of all of this is the goal not only of
these news providers, but the software companies _ AvantGo, i3
Mobile, Aether Systems, InfoSpace.com, Phone.com, Microsoft's MSN
Mobile, AnyDevice.com and numerous others _ that serve as digital
clipping or delivery services. Their customers are likely to be the
manufacturers of the mobile devices.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the creators of the protocols and digital
languages _ like the Wireless Application Protocol, or WAP, and
Bluetooth, a radiowave-based protocol that allows hand-held devices
to talk to others nearby _ that are the ink of this on-the-go,
print-with-electrons process. And finally, there are the
infrastructure builders, like IBM, Nortel and Ericsson, and the
device makers _ Palm, Psion, Sharp, Motorola, Nokia _ and finally
telecommunications firms worldwide, from Sprint, AT&AMP;T and Bell
Atlantic's Verizon to Vodafone AirTouch and Japan's NTT DoCoMo.
</P>
<P>
   The small screens will simply be a technical and editing
challenge, not an impediment, to the growth of wireless news,
argues Mitchell Stephens, author of ``A History of News'' (Harcourt
Brace, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   ``News has adapted itself to all sorts of formats throughout its
history,'' Stephens, a professor of journalism and mass
communications at New York University, said. ``The very first
newspapers in Europe had very short, what we would almost call
telegraphic news items. When the telegraph came in, news compacted
itself to travel over those expensive lines. Then you had news on
zippers in Times Square. News has fit in all sorts of places and it
will fit here.''

 &HT;    Georgia flag not flying over King's memorial
 &HT;    By Ron Hayes
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ While South Carolina is still fighting
an increasingly uncivil war over the Confederate battle flag, this
city has apparently made peace before controversy could flare.
</P>
<P>
   Workmen were completing the Martin Luther King Jr. Landmark
Memorial Thursday afternoon when electrician John Padgett happened
to glance up at the 21 flags that had just been raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe that for Martin Luther King they would have
that flag up there, with all that's going on now,'' Padgett said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Each flag was to represent some aspect of King's life: A Swedish
flag, for the country that gave him the Nobel Prize for Peace. The
flag of Washington, D.C., where he delivered his most lasting
speech. And a Georgia state flag, to mark his birthplace.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's flag, however, prominently incorporates the Stars and
Bars of the Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   Padgett went to John Alford, the city's superintendent for
public works, who was overseeing the project. ``And I said, 'Take
that down.''' Alford said Saturday. ``It's not appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   If the memorial committee chose to fly the flag after his job
was done, Alford said, that would be their business. ``But I didn't
want it up there during my construction. I've got black workers,
white workers, Hispanic workers here, 50 to 70 at a time, and it's
not appropriate.'' Both Padgett and Alford are white.
</P>
<P>
   At Saturday's dedication, the Georgia flag remained unflown, and
there were no plans to raise it again.

UNDATED: fit here.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even in the infancy of the mobile news business, there are
distinctive cultural accents to the business. In the United States,
analysts say, hand-held ``personal companions'' _ the Palm Pilot
has 68 percent of the worldwide market _ have become the early
favorite among wireless news delivery devices, picking up where the
abbreviated paging devices, with their sports-and-stock-bulletin
capacity, left off. In Europe and Japan, users prefer cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   Extending out from its U.S. base, the Palm is gaining a toehold
in the rest of the world. Currently, according to Michael Mace,
chief competitive officer for Palm Inc., there are about 6.5
million devices with the Palm operating system worldwide _ the vast
majority of them Palm Pilots. His company shipped 3 million in
1999, he said, double the rate of the previous year. An increase of
40 percent over 1999 sales sales is forecast for 2000 but, Mace
said, the sales in the first quarter of 2000 were more than double
the number in the comparable period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But these figures are dwarfed by the sales of cellular phones _
about 275 million worldwide last year. About 1 billion cellular
phones will be in use by 2003, according to several research
estimates _ though a much smaller number will be able to tap into
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how many users are getting access to the Internet
through these devices is still hard to measure, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of intermediate firms, which provide data to wireless
devices, grows weekly. Of those serving the Palm, AvantGo is among
the best known, offering services for free to users of the
hand-held devices and hoping to earn its keep with a portion of the
revenues the media companies earn from the new mobile readers.
</P>
<P>
   Felix Lin, founder and chairman of AvantGo, said the company was
founded at about the same time as the first batch of Palm Pilots
was shipped in 1996. By developing alliances with media companies
like the News Corp.'s Fox unit, stock tracking services like Stock
Smart, and other sources of information _ providers of maps, ski
resort information, restaurant and movie listings, games,
horoscopes and the like _ AvantGo has developed an inventory of
hundreds of ``channels'' that mobile device owners can receive when
they log in, either through synchronization devices that reach the
Internet through desktop computers, or through wireless antennas.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe and Japan, cellular telephones became popular far
earlier than in the United States. The development of the Wireless
Application Protocol, simplifying the delivery of news to these
devices, coupled with the pervasiveness of cellular phones, have
made these devices the instrument of choice to receive news on the
go, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   But most existing phones can only receive short messages. Scott
Woefel, general manager and editor in chief of CNN.com, said 41
million cellular phone users could get news, sports and financial
data from CNN, but he did not know what fraction of this group
actually subscribed to CNN's service.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the network has a full-time staff dedicated to
reformatting its news reports for pagers and cellular phones, 24
hours a day. Separately, the company, like many other news
organizations, has a deal with AvantGo, through which a portion of
its Web site's content can be transferred to hand-held devices
running on the Palm Pilot operating system, or its rivals,
Microsoft's Windows CE and Symbian's EPOC.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is part of our bigger strategy,'' Woefel said.
Delivery of CNN news, he said, should come in

said, the sales in the first quarter of 2000 were more than double
the number in the comparable period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But these figures are dwarfed by the sales of cellular phones _
about 275 million worldwide last year. About 1 billion cellular
phones will be in use by 2003, according to several research
estimates _ though a much smaller number will be able to tap into
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how many users are getting access to the Internet
through these devices is still hard to measure, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of intermediate firms, which provide data to wireless
devices, grows weekly. Of those serving the Palm, AvantGo is among
the best known, offering services for free to users of the
hand-held devices and hoping to earn its keep with a portion of the
revenues the media companies earn from the new mobile readers.
</P>
<P>
   Felix Lin, founder and chairman of AvantGo, said the company was
founded at about the same time as the first batch of Palm Pilots
was shipped in 1996. By developing alliances with media companies
like the News Corp.'s Fox unit, stock tracking services like Stock
Smart, and other sources of information _ providers of maps, ski
resort information, restaurant and movie listings, games,
horoscopes and the like _ AvantGo has developed an inventory of
hundreds of ``channels'' that mobile device owners can receive when
they log in, either through synchronization devices that reach the
Internet through desktop computers, or through wireless antennas.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe and Japan, cellular telephones became popular far
earlier than in the United States. The development of the Wireless
Application Protocol, simplifying the delivery of news to these
devices, coupled with the pervasiveness of cellular phones, have
made these devices the instrument of choice to receive news on the
go, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   But most existing phones can only receive short messages. Scott
Woefel, general manager and editor in chief of CNN.com, said 41
million cellular phone users could get news, sports and financial
data from CNN, but he did not know what fraction of this group
actually subscribed to CNN's service.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the network has a full-time staff dedicated to
reformatting its news reports for pagers and cellular phones, 24
hours a day. Separately, the company, like many other news
organizations, has a deal with AvantGo, through which a portion of
its Web site's content can be transferred to hand-held devices
running on the Palm Pilot operating system, or its rivals,
Microsoft's Windows CE and Symbian's EPOC.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is part of our bigger strategy,'' Woefel said.
Delivery of CNN news, he said, should come in ``three primary ways
_ TV in the home, a computer in the office, and one of these
hand-held devices everywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to align ourselves too closely with one
technology or one company,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Reuters, too, is pushing for predominance in mobile information,
both through the news and financial data it supplies to Web sites
and through investments in companies like Phone.com, Yahoo and
Aether, according to Jonathan Baile, managing director of Reuters
Wireless Services.
</P>
<P>
   David Wachtel, publisher of Bloomberg Media, said the type of
news delivered would be determined in part by the device involved.
``The idea that people are going to read their entire newspaper
over the phone is wrong,'' he said. ``But quick bits of information
in a hurry, yes.''
</P>
<P>
   The editing of news for hand-held devices is becoming a
necessary skill at news Web sites. Several providers, like
Space.com. CNet's News.com, The New York Times and many Knight
Ridder newspapers offer a bouquet of eight to 20 headlines and
summaries, sometimes grouped under categories like sports and
entertainment. When a user clicks on a headline, a full story or
commentary becomes available.
</P>
<P>
   Other news providers, like The Financial Times' site, ft.com,
and USAToday.com offer streamlined, 250- or 300-word articles but
cover a broader range of subjects. News.com, like CNNfn and ESPN,
provide updates frequently; the articles can be brief or as long as
800 words.
</P>
<P>
   In general, financial and sports offerings, from sites like The
Wall Street Journal's wsj.com and espn.com, are much more likely to
be kept current. Gannett's USAToday.com is one of several general
news providers that offer updates on most topics throughout the
day. The New York Times offering of front page articles on Avantgo,
which are not updated, is the service's most requested channel,
Avantgo executives say.
</P>
<P>
   But it is often the most prosaic information that is the most
popular. Through AvantGo, the Web site of The Knoxville News
Sentinel offers detailed traffic reports, and Access Atlanta offers
weather bulletins that can be urgent during tornado season.
</P>
<P>
   But Jonathan Bell, Knoxville's senior Web designer, said, ``The
thing people are asking us for are movie times.''

 &HT;    Rapper Shawntae Harris refuses to be neatly defined. She's
everything you've heard. And more.
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Well aware that this is a story for the newspaper,
rapper Da Brat doesn't present herself as the character who's
brazen enough to mix drinks and offer marijuana to hip-hop magazine
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   We're backstage at the American Airlines Arena, an hour before
she takes the stage as opening act for good friend and pop star
Mariah Carey. The performer born Shawntae Harris is calm, cool and
_ with the help of probably too many Advils _ relaxed on a brown
leather sofa.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes before, her wild side got a warm-up in a conversation
with the music video request channel, The Box.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching y'all the other day when you were doing your
`Bad Girls' (segment),'' she told one of the executives, a smile
spreading across her face. ``Watched the whole thing. Even
requested something, I think. Then it got to the end _ no Brat! I
was like, `Where's my (stuff) man?' I'm going to have to (mess)
y'all up!''
</P>
<P>
   But now she's sitting down for her first interview since being
charged with battery March 7 for a fight in an Atlanta club. And
while the endearing performer is still smiling, she's speaking in a
measured whisper quite unlike her fast-paced, slightly nasal, rap
style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey guuuuys,'' she asks the two people she introduces as her
sister and brother, assistant Tina Spence and protege Twenty II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you keep it down a little bit so I can do this?''
</P>
<P>
   Not the demeanor you'd expected from someone accused of beating
another woman in the face.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't take long to realize there are many sides to Da
Brat.
</P>
<P>
   Harris grew up in two Chicago homes. One was what she calls the
``sanctified, sanctified, oh so sanctified'' Pentecostal household
of her mother and grandmother. There, she had to wear skirts that
hung past her knees. ``Granny'' sent ``Shawnie'' to church Sunday,
Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday, where she played the drums and sang
in the choir. And if Harris wanted to have music by then-favorite
rappers LL Cool J or Monie Love, she had to write a gospel artists'
name on the spine of the cassette cover.
</P>
<P>
   But at her father and his mom's house (her parents never
married), the only child known as ``Boo-Boo'' recalls, ``I could
cuss when I want to, listen to whatever I wanted to and beat up
whoever my cousins told me to.''
</P>
<P>
   So being both ``Shawnie'' of the once-sanctified household and
the ``Boo Boo'' who shares matching tattoos with her dad is how
Harris has lived all of her 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   She turns 26 Friday, ending what what will certainly be a
whirlwind week. Her third album, ``Unrestricted,'' comes out
Tuesday. And two days later she's due in Atlanta Municipal Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm maintaining my innocence,'' is all Harris offers,
specifically, about the incident that landed her in front of the
law.
</P>
<P>
   According to the police report, that late Tuesday night she
ordered an aspiring rapper named Reszue Robateue to get off the
railing near the Chilli Pepper's VIP lounge, where Harris was
sitting. Robateue refused and the two began to fight. Witnesses
said Harris hit Robateue with either a gun or a shot glass. In the
end, Robateue was charged with a misdemeanor while Harris was
charged with felony aggravated battery because of the seriousness
of the injuries to Robateue's forehead and eye.
</P>
<P>
   Police initially thought a shooting five nights later in front
of Harris's Atlanta townhome was payback for the fight. Since then
officials have said it was drug-related and meant for someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Which was neither good nor bad news to Harris.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really thought about it,'' she says. When gunfire
erupted outside her place, she was in Mexico shooting a video for
the sexually suggestive single ``What `Chu Like.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't bother me because I was in Cancun,'' she says.
``Working, not bothering anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   But less then a week later, Harris' family moved her out of the
gated community, where monthly rent ranges from $800-$2,000. She
wasn't asked to leave, she says, and doesn't feel comfortable
revealing where her new place is.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family just wanted to get me out of there,'' Harris says.
Then she narrows her big almond eyes into a splinter, and shakes
her neatly braided head: ``They don't play when it comes to me.''
</P>
<P>
   RAPS TO HER OWN BEAT
</P>
<P>
   When she made her entrance at the Ocean Boulevard offices of
cable channel The Box earlier that afternoon, she took a limo _
even though the $700-a-night hotel she's staying in is yards away.
</P>
<P>
   But hey, she's a star.
</P>
<P>
   And yet she treats everyone waiting for her like a longtime
member of her constellation.
</P>
<P>
   A Box employee approaches Harris: ``Hello Brat, I met you. . .
''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the Jagged Edge party a couple weeks ago,'' she says, not
missing a beat. He holds his hand out; She greets him with a big
hug. As he returns it, one arm slightly lifts up Harris' white
T-shirt to reveal an unlikely undergarment: White, puffy,
cartoon-stamped boxer shorts. At 5-foot 4, the rapper's 140-pound
frame is still conditioned years after playing basketball and
running track at Chicago's Kenwood Academy.
</P>
<P>
   She wears her favorite designer jeans, Girbaud, backwards; a nod
to Atlanta rap duo Kris Kross's early '90s style. The two
introduced Harris to their producer, Jermaine Dupri, who signed her
to Atlanta-based So So Def Records. He was, he remembers, impressed
with her immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``She rapped with so much confidence,'' says Dupri, ``and she
wasn't scared to say whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   When Harris' first album, ``Funkdafied,'' came out in 1994,
female rappers like Queen Latifah, Salt-N-Pepa and Yo Yo played up
their femininity. Their lyrical focus was often on the pluses and
minuses of being women (sometimes to the detriment of the
accompanying track). And while they were respected, they still had
a hard time generating sales in what has traditionally been a
male-dominated genre.
</P>
<P>
   Harris came on the scene with the same braided hairstyle that
Kris Kross and Dupri wore. She just had colored barrettes on hers.
Clothes? Same thing. Baggy shirts and jeans, worn backwards. And
her debut embraced the more musical, band-oriented R&AMP;B of the '70s
era when the Isley Brothers and Parliament-Funkadelic flourished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brat was the kind of girl guys could feel comfortable
around,'' says Chris Smith of Kris Kross. And obviously more than a
few felt comfortable buying her music. ``Funkdafied'' was the first
album by a solo female rapper to sell a million copies.
</P>
<P>
   Its 1996 follow-up, ``Anuthatantrum,'' sold half as many, but
her hip-hop profile has only risen. Guest appearances on hit
records by pop singer Mariah Carey (``Always Be My Baby,''
``Heartbreaker'' remixes), R&AMP;B quartet Dru Hill (``In My Bed''
remix) and fellow rappers Lil' Kim, Missy ``Misdemeanor'' Elliott,
Lisa ``Left-Eye'' Lopes and Angie Martinez (the Grammy-nominated
``Not Tonight'') have kept her in the public ear, and eye, during
the four years between her own releases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which is the master plan right now,'' she spouts at the three
cameramen in the Box. ``To keep Da Brat-tat-tat-tat in y'alls face
all the (expletive) time! Shocking people! ''
</P>
<P>
   That may mean getting out of her still-preferred tomboy gear and
putting on a tight-fitting jumpsuit every once in a while, which
she did on last year's Soul Train Awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's cool, I don't mind showing a little skin,'' she
adds, citing her generous backside and other assets (``32-Bs or
32-Cs,'' she says, ``depending on the cut of the bra). ``I'm not
all cellulited or keloided up underneath here.''
</P>
<P>
   Wanting to ``stay in people's faces'' may also mean she'll have
to take her 6-foot-4 inch, 225-pound bodyguard with her when the
urge for Gladys Knight's Chicken and Waffles hits. (The same
bodyguard, mind you, who had three auditions for the imposing
Michael Clarke Duncan's role in the movie ``The Green Mile.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``But that makes a lot of sense to me because when stars like
her are out, people are always at them for something,'' says radio
personality Ryan Cameron, one of Harris's friends. ``I see it all
the time. She needs security. I mean she's young, enjoying life, so
she's going to be out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Literally and figuratively.
</P>
<P>
   All you have to do is pick up the May issue of hip-hop magazine
XXL to see that. In it, she goes so far as to detail exactly how to
drive a man wild at, shall we say, that critical moment.
</P>
<P>
   But talking that way to a mainstream audience is another matter
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the people who are going to read this will probably
only pick it up because they heard about that mess last month,''
she says on the sofa, still waiting for the Advil to kick in. ``And
I want them to know I'm not a violent person... I'm not stupid. I
know there's a time and place for everything. A time for playing,
cursing and acting silly, because that's me too. And a time to act
like I have the sense my family gave me.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly Granny.

<P>
   Esther Dyson was presiding over the most recent meeting of
Icann, the controversial international group that is trying to
create the Internet's first democracy. While she sat on a stage
facing an audience of several hundred, her frustration and
impatience grew increasingly apparent, as people filed to a
microphone in the aisle to voice their complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Many opposed the interim board's proposal to elect permanent
members through an indirect process. But Dyson, the interim
chairwoman, defended the policy of using an electoral council
instead of letting the world's Internet users vote directly for
their board representatives. That was the best way, she told the
group, to prevent the nomination of ``people who are stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, after seeing her remark on The New York Times Web
page, Dyson took exception. ``Out of context,'' she said. ``I might
have said it, but it was out of context.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever her intention, the remark put Dyson directly at odds
with some of the same civil liberties groups that have long been
among her staunchest supporters. And the incident last month in
Cairo, Egypt, made clear that despite her unofficial titles of
doyenne of cyberspace and queen of the digerati, a politician is
one thing that Dyson is not.
</P>
<P>
   It has been nearly two years since Dyson was chosen to be
interim head of Icann _ Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and
Numbers _ with the mandate of leading the Clinton administration's
effort to move oversight of the network from federal contractors to
the international Internet community.
</P>
<P>
   But she has ruled Icann's fractious public meetings with a mix
of impatience, frustration and condescension. And the paucity of
diplomacy, some Internet executives say, has played a role in
Icann's rocky start. Among the missteps, two of the group's
earliest decisions _ to hold closed meetings and to levy a $1 tax
on Internet addresses _ were later rescinded under pressure from
the administration and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that what you see sometimes is that she doesn't quite
have the common touch,'' said Mike Godwin, a lawyer who worked with
Dyson in the early 1990s at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a
public interest group devoted to the defense of free speech and
civil rights on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that there is a dimension of being a political being
that involves going out and getting hands on and dealing with
individuals,'' said Godwin, who is now senior legal editor of
E-Commerce Law Weekly, a print publication. ``I don't think she is
terribly comfortable with that. I think she is democratic in
principle but not entirely democratic in practice.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week at her cluttered office in New York,
on a rare day when she was not traveling, Dyson defended her
leadership style. ``I don't have a tolerance for having my time
wasted; I'm straightforward,'' she said. ``It's not a question of
intelligence; it's a question of appropriateness.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most who know Esther Dyson say she does not suffer fools
gladly. But she was picked to head Icann not for her tact but
because of her international reputation for independence, integrity
and straightforward manner.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 foot 3 and 47 years of age, Dyson is a wiry, almost elfin
figure, with seeming disregard for the trappings of makeup and
fashion. She keeps her hair short and simply cut. She scurries
around her office and official meetings wearing socks without
shoes. And she often wears faded blue jeans, typically accompanied
by an oversized T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of the renowned physicist Freeman Dyson, she is
described by another Electronic Frontier Foundation colleague, John
Gilmore, as having ``formidable intelligence.'' But Dyson's fast
mind can manifest itself in ways that may come across as dismissive
and condescending.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is not a people person,'' said Jerry Michalski. For five
years, Michalski wrote Release 1.0, the influential technology
newsletter that Dyson's company, EDventure holdings, publishes
monthly. Michalski left about two years ago to become a freelance
consultant and speaker, a decision made in part, he explained, by
the emotional wall that he said she kept between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``She likes humans,'' he said. ``She just doesn't do small talk.
If you hang out with her, it feels awkward. If you start talking
about feelings, she will turn around and leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever her interpersonal skills, over the last 20 years Dyson
has cultivated long-standing relationships with a wide circle of
some of the most influential people in the computer and Internet
industries.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Harvard with a bachelor's degree in economics,
Dyson began her career in the computer world in the 1970s, covering
the budding industry as a reporter for Forbes magazine. From there
she moved to Wall Street as an analyst.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982 she formed her venture capital firm after buying a
computer industry newsletter that she renamed Release 1.0. With
that newsletter came a related annual conference, which she has
parlayed into an invitation-only event, called PC Forum, that the
industry's top executives and digerati are afraid to miss _ even at
a registration fee of $4,500.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson is also on the board of numerous companies and nonprofit
groups around the world and has become a mainstay at Internet
conferences and policy panels. And she has positioned herself as a
well-paid, highly sought speaker.
</P>
<P>
   As former chairman, and now vice chairman, of the Electronic
Frontier Foundation, she espoused some of the earliest predictions
about the complex challenges the Internet would pose for
intellectual property and privacy. And she has served on special
federal commissions on intellectual property, privacy and
encryption.
</P>
<P>
   In her role as a civil libertarian, however, Dyson is more of an
observer, a thinker, than an activist, according to people who know
her well, who say she seems more comfortable with identifying tough
issues than taking on the hard fight to resolve them.
</P>
<P>
   And certainly that limitation drew criticism to her 1997 book,
``Release 2.0: A Design for Living in the Digital Age,'' which some
critics derided as a naive collection of only sometimes interesting
observations.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Lambert, reviewing the book for Business Week, said
Dyson ``glosses over the obstacles that lie in the way'' of
achieving the ``electronic Utopia she foresees.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, when Dyson talks, people in the digital world listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Esther starts talking about something, and you don't know
why, you better start paying attention,'' said Miljenko Horvak, a
former Citibank executive who is involved in several Eastern
European start-up companies with Dyson. For instance, Horvak said,
Dyson started talking about online privacy five years ago, well
before it became a cause celebre.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this thing that I call Esther's orbit,'' Horvak said.
``She, by the gravitational pull of her personality and her person
get all of these different kinds of people to be in orbit around
her.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And that ``pull,'' Horvak says, does not involve charisma or
charm. But finding someone to say anything more critical for public
attribution is nearly impossible. ``Can we go off the record?'' is
the first thing many people said when asked to comment for this
article.
</P>
<P>
   As one acquaintance put it: ``People are afraid to say bad
things about Esther. Not because she is not a nice person, or out
of fear of retribution from her, but because they think it will
cast negatively on them.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent Icann controversy is the issue of electing half
of the 18-member board. Originally the voting was to be complete by
the end of this September, but it is now not expected to be
finished until sometime next year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as some blame Dyson for not being a better leader and
problem solver, many give her credit for dedicating the time
necessary to keep the very fragile Icann experiment from blowing up
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Cochetti, who as a policy executive with IBM helped select
Dyson as Icann's interim chairwoman, said the decision was not
based on the assumption that she had a unique insight into the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are probably about 1,000 people in the world who are as
insightful about the Internet as Esther,'' Cochetti said. ``People
may disagree with Esther, and they may disagree with either her
substance or her tactics, but it's rare _ if ever _ that anyone has
ever questioned her integrity,'' he said. ``She is a person who
from my experience operates from her principle. You can rely on
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before taking on the Icann duties, Dyson was spending 70
percent to 80 percent of her life on the road, attending her
different board meetings and conferences and overseeing the
personal investments she has in some 30 technology companies around
the world _ many of them obscure ventures in Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Her Icann work comes atop this heavy load. And the strain of the
group's highly contentious process shows during Icann's public
forums, which are purposely held in a different country each time _
and at which Dyson has become increasingly curt to the people who
line up at the microphones to challenge proposed policies or
question the group's procedures.
</P>
<P>
   It is because Dyson has built a career as a seeming voice for
the little guy, the individual user of digital technology, that
some people in the electronic libertarian community say they feel a
bit abandoned by Dyson in the Icann process.
</P>
<P>
   They cite an episode last fall, when a coalition of nonprofit
groups traveled to Chile for an Icann board meeting. The group
asked the board to slow its policy-making until Icann had
representation from noncommercial interests and individuals. As
critics lined up to question how Icann, for example, had arrived at
its business-backed policy for cracking down on so-called
cybersquatters, Dyson's growing irritation became evident.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all due respect,'' she told the audience, ``we are less
interested in complaints about the process'' and more interested in
``doing real work and moving forward.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the case of last month's meeting in Cairo, Dyson and the
rest of the board at first resisted demands from powerful groups
like Common Cause and the Center for Democracy and Technology that
they reconsider the election plan.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, despite Dyson's ``people who are stupid'' remark,
the interim board listened and agreed to allow direct election of
the new members. But it remains unclear whether the hostilities
will dissipate and the board will again attempt to work closely
with the civil libertarians.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson admits that Icann has made mistakes. But she said she was
not sure how she might have made things work better. ``Could I have
been more forceful in raising some of things that I think were
mistakes?'' she said. ``I don't know. It might have worked and it
might have backfired.''
</P>
<P>
   And many of her critics and her supporters agree that, whatever
the shortcomings, she has credibly performed a thankless job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone could have done it any better than Esther
has,'' Godwin said. ``It's to Esther's credit that Icann hasn't
been laughed out of existence.''

`RIDE DOWN MOUNT MORGAN': ANOTHER ASTONISHING ARTHUR MILLER

 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As Lyman Felt, the joyously eloquent, sexually
rapacious and relentlessly self-justifying bigamist at the center
of ``The Ride Down Mount Morgan,'' Arthur Miller's seriously
discomforting comedy that opened at the Ambassador Theater on
Broadway yesterday, Patrick Stewart makes a fine devil for a new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   A man who wants everything and can deny himself nothing, Lyman
suffers great loss as a result _ public humiliation, private
desperation _ but in the end, well, the pleasure of living his
carefully maintained double life was probably worth its ultimate
destruction. Indeed, in Miller's intelligent and savage satire,
Lyman doesn't really come to grief; by narrow-minded
interpretation, the play makes a pretty good case for bigamy as a
lifestyle choice. And it is the achievement of Stewart, who plays
Lyman with a vigorous moment-to-moment charm that feels downright
presidential, that such stunning amorality seems nearly reasonable.
It's hard to imagine a more sympathetic creep.
</P>
<P>
   As the latest entry in the astonishing resurrection of Miller's
work on Broadway (and elsewhere) over the last two years, ``The
Ride Down Mount Morgan'' bears comparison to his other recently
revived plays, not least because it revisits, in a comic vein
unusual for this most sober playwright, many of their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   It has the dangerous lure of reckless desire that brought down
Eddie Carbone in ``A View From the Bridge''; in its mix of dream,
memory and temporal reality it effects a psychological excavation
on Lyman similar to that visited on Willy Loman in ``Death of a
Salesman.'' And as in ``The Price,'' in which two brothers enact a
debate over whether discarding or refusing to forget the unhappy
past is the more responsible path to the future, at the play's
center is a fierce moral argument, fully articulated on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mount Morgan'' doesn't pack the gut punch of any of those, but
it is a pretty good poke in the side. Lyman's lust doesn't kill
him, after all. The psychodrama releases in him more chagrin than
potent shame and the moral debate is bogus; one side of the scale,
the one that makes Lyman's case for the righteousness of deception,
has Miller's thumb on it. In his rhetorical gifts, his urgent
appetites, his energy, Lyman is simply given more weapons than
either of his wives _ one Protestant, one Jewish; his desire has a
catholic embrace _ who are armed with little more than hurt and
outrage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then explain to yourself,'' Lyman bellows to Theo, his older
wife, ``how this worthless, loveless, treacherous clam could have
single-handedly made two such different women happier than they'd
ever been in their lives!''
</P>
<P>
   The truth in the statement reduces her name-calling to a
sputter.
</P>
<P>
   First produced in London in 1991, the play was written, Miller
has said, with a political motivation, as a response to the Reagan
'80s, when greed loomed as good, selfishness a virtue. And indeed,
Lyman, a powerful insurance executive, is drawn as a caricature of
invincibility in the Tom Wolfe ``master of the universe'' mode.
</P>
<P>
   But as the play opens, that view of himself is under serious
challenge. The setting is a hospital room near Elmira, N.Y., where
Lyman is recovering from a near-fatal auto accident, having
recklessly taken his Porsche on the titular journey in the middle
of a snowstorm. When the curtain rises, he is waking to himself
after what he thinks is a bad dream but is in fact the case: that
the nurse has summoned Theo (Frances Conroy), his wife of 30 years,
from Manhattan and that she has arrived with their adult daughter
(Shannon Burkett) in Elmira, where he spends half his time with his
second, younger wife, Leah (Katy Selverstone), who has also shown
up at the hospital and with whom he has a son.
</P>
<P>
   That the wives have met is his real-life nightmare, but it is
also true that in his delirium he has looked into the void and
found, to his relief, no condemnation there. In a production given
a gleaming ``unmoored to the real world'' look by John Arnone, its
talkiness crisply paced under the polished direction of David
Esbjornson (both are significant players in the creation of Lyman's
glib and godless head game), the play, replete with flashbacks and
fantasies, takes the form of Lyman's ardent explanation of himself
to his disbelieving families.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't that Lyman is without guilt. He berates himself _ ``No
guts'' _ for his failure to split from Theo when, as a mere
philanderer, he decides to marry Leah so she will not abort her
pregnancy. And he suffers recriminations in dreams: in one
startlingly cartoonish sequence the wives enter wearing crows'
heads, peck out his innards and disembowel him with their beaks.
But he fully believes that what perpetuating his deception has cost
him in self-rebuke is full payment for his actions. And he is
entirely without shame. He's the kind of man who blithely informs
his nurse, a black woman, that his business has ``the biggest
training program of any company for you guys''; who uses his lackey
lawyer as a confessor from whom he presumes absolution; and who,
when he says, ``a man can be faithful to himself or to other
people, but not to both, at least not happily,'' invokes the
Scriptures for confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know this,'' he tells the lawyer, Tom Wilson (John C.
Vennema), ``but it's immoral to admit that the first law of life is
betrayal; why else did those rabbis pick Cain and Abel to open the
Bible?''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, looking fit and bouncy as a boy (he appears,
fleetingly, stripped to his briefs), plays Lyman with the lustiness
of a Mediterranean peasant and an ineffable energy for sucking the
pleasure out of existence, which he makes an enviable quality.
Beneath a business-trim, Clinton-silver hairpiece (its
transformative power on his famously bald pate is an astonishment),
he has abandoned his ordinarily kingly authority for the rakishness
of a spoiled prince, mischievously bawdy in a hospital gown.
Grinning in jumpy amusement or howling in dismay at the knots he
has tied in his life, he always seems enlivened.
</P>
<P>
   In one flashback scene, he stares down a lion on the loose
during an African safari and bellows his secret fears in the face
of the beast. It's a wildly overwrought idea, but Stewart makes a
credibly invigorating moment of it.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a conspiracy of playwright and director, none of the other
actors are allowed an equivalent animation. As Theo, a minister's
daughter, the formidable Conroy is a walking bust of WASPy and
waspish rectitude. Leah, a businesswoman whom Lyman first seduces
across a conference table, is played by Selverstone with a
combative veneer but the soul of a lonely sex kitten.
</P>
<P>
   Neither character is a match for Lyman in the department of
ingratiation. Slyly, maybe insidiously, Miller wants to tease us
with the feeling that Lyman actually deserves to have them both.
And under Esbjornson's direction, the two actors deliver their
lines in a declamatory, less-than-engaged elocution. The same is
true of Vennema and Burkett. In the world of this play, Stewart's
Lyman rules; everyone seems more connected when he's at the hub of
the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mount Morgan'' has been revived two other times since its
initial production nine years ago, most recently with Stewart,
Conroy and Vennema, at the Joseph Papp Public Theater in 1998.
Whether the Broadway version has wrought significant improvement on
the others is hard to say _ I hadn't seen it before _ but it does
feel very much as though the play has found its moment.
</P>
<P>
   With the White House scandal receding to a footnote, its lasting
impact may be the official imprimatur it gave to a national
position on profligacy; ultimately it's forgivable. The new century
is a blank slate when it comes to moral convention, isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   By now the baby boomers have advanced to an age in which tedium
is the test of marriage; they, or at least the theatergoers among
them, have made ``Dinner With Friends,'' a play by Donald Margulies
that deals earnestly with the subject, a surprise Off Broadway hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why does anyone stay together once they realize who they're
with?'' an exasperated Theo says in ``Mount Morgan,'' a line that,
at the performance I saw, was greeted not only with sustained
laughter, but applause.
</P>
<P>
   Miller knows his audience. At such a time, he is letting us
know, the devil will have his due.  &QL;

CRIME YARN MAY SET PRECEDENT ON CANADIAN SHIELD RIGHTS  
 BY JAMES BROOKE  
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Stephen Williams, the author of a best-selling crime
book, sees the day coming when he will be called to a witness stand
and ordered to identify who gave him precise details of a gory sex
murder scene in the tale.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I refuse to do that, they are going to toss me in
jail,'' the author of ``Invisible Darkness'' (Bantam), said in a
telephone interview from his farm north of here.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, a country often called politely authoritarian,
advocates for freedom of the press hope the Williams case will set
a precedent for the kind of reporter's shield legislation that
spread in the United States in the 1970s. Today, 30 states have
laws that give reporters varying degrees of protection to shield
their sources from public identification.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one case where Canada should follow its neighbor to
the south; you can't have vigorous reporting without laws
protecting sources,'' said Tom Goldstein, dean of the Columbia
University School of Journalism. ``If you can't protect sources,
and the sources can't be assured that they will be protected, they
hesitate to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally, Canadian prosecutors avoid confrontations on
reporters' shield issues. And the murders in question have already
resulted in convictions and jail time.
</P>
<P>
   But in Canada, where the founding motto in 1867 was ``peace,
order and good government,'' judges and juries historically have
not believed that there is much privileged about the relationship
between a reporter and a source.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has never been a case in Canada where a journalist has
been excused from answering a question about a source,'' said Alan
N. Young, who is defending Williams.
</P>
<P>
   And the prospects for setting a precedent do not look good.
Williams was charged with two counts of disobeying a judge's order,
and lost his motions to have the case dismissed. The charges stem
from the belief that Williams saw a videotape of two sex murders
that a judge had barred from the public.
</P>
<P>
   Poring over Williams' 657-page book, detectives say they came up
with 27 passages that they believe were based on watching the
tapes. Williams has denied seeing the tapes, a denial he repeated
in the interview. He has said he had gotten almost all the details
from material available to the public and would not say where he
had gotten the rest.
</P>
<P>
   In court last fall, the government stated that 69 people
authorized by the court, mostly prosecutors, had viewed the
restricted tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Williams commented, ``It would be professional suicide for
anyone who had access to the tapes to show them'' to unauthorized
people.'' He added, ``They would lose everything they had _ lawyers
would be disbarred, doctors would have their licenses revoked, cops
would lose their pensions and be fired.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Ontario judge, David Fairgrieve, has ruled that
Williams' book can be used as evidence against him. He has deferred
ruling on the issue of journalistic privilege until it comes up in
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors in the case declined to comment. David Paciocco, a
former prosecutor, said Canadian courts ``have a general aversion
to recognizing privileges.''
</P>
<P>
   Paciocco, a law professor at the University of Ottawa, said
prosecutors generally tried to work around privilege claims. ``No
one wants to get into a showdown with a stubborn journalist, one
who might to go to jail to protect a source,'' he said.

STOCK SHOCK IS A SIGNAL: TOUGH TIMES FOR E-TAILERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, a short-term battering of technology stocks and a
drumbeat of financial distress signals from e-commerce retailers
reminded the world that even dot-coms cannot assume a never-ending
flow of money.
</P>
<P>
   Not that David Friedensohn needed reminding. He still recalls a
lean week in late 1996 at SonicNet, the music Web site he was
running, when after meeting the payroll he had $50 left in the
bank. SonicNet escaped insolvency by being bought.
</P>
<P>
   Now Friedensohn runs an online video store called BigStar
Entertainment, which went public last August and by last Friday had
seen its share price sink to $3.75 _ 62 percent below the offering
price.
</P>
<P>
   He knows, like many e-tailers these days, that he cannot expect
to raise more money any time soon through a secondary offering. So
Friedensohn has taken what, for an Internet company at least, is
drastic action: He has slashed BigStar's marketing expenses 60
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of burning through his $25 million in cash in a year,
Friedensohn said, he now will survive 18 months _ long enough to
hope the company will be able to move into the black.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only smart thing I can do right now is take the cash I
have and assume I can't get any more,'' he said. ``I'm not going to
run into a brick wall like some of these companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week's market volatility made it painfully clear that many
Internet companies, especially the electronic retailers that
operate online stores, may be heading toward that wall. As a
sector, the so-called e-tailing companies' stock prices are now off
60 to 90 percent from their highs last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Such a drop is depressing for any business. But it is life
threatening for most e-tailers because nearly all of them went
public with the explicit plan of losing money for years while they
were building their brands and systems. And it seems doubtful that
many will be able to raise the second and third installments of
cash they had been counting on _ and that they will need for
carrying out those ambitious business plans.
</P>
<P>
   So now what?
</P>
<P>
   Like a Formula One race car driver who finds himself heading
into a sharp turn too fast, the choice is between hoping that luck
and skill can prevail over physics _ or slowing down to see whether
more reckless rivals spin out of control as they pull ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have to make tough strategic choices to survive in this
environment,'' said Jonathan V. Diamond, chairman of CDNow, a music
e-tailer that has seen its own stock crater and now finds itself
back on the auction block after its merger with the Columbia House
record club was canceled last month.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies, like BigStar, are slamming on the brakes. Others
are making painful compromises to press ahead. Egghead.com, for
example, has been forced to seek private financing, at a discount
to the price of its publicly traded stock, which is now at $7.3125,
compared with more than $39 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, PlanetRX, an online drugstore, is one of the
companies that is moving ahead in full knowledge that its cash
cannot hold out until it breaks even. PlanetRX had planned a
secondary stock offering, William J. Razzouk, its chairman said,
but will not take that step as long as its stock remains 88 percent
below its October high of $36.50.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Razzouk's company will fine tune spending, in his
words, and defer plans to raise more money until its stock price
rises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, you manage your cash flow, and things that are not
absolutely, positively critical, you do without,'' he said. ``But
we will earn the opportunity to refill the gas tank one or two more
times, so long as investors see that we are making progress to
profitability.''
</P>
<P>
   Why are so many e-tailers in such dire straits? It is not
because people do not like shopping online. If anything, Internet
sales are ahead of expectations.
</P>
<P>
   But the online stores are finding it much more expensive than
they had expected to find and serve customers, while at the same
time the frantic pace of competition is depressing prices and
forcing costly giveaways like free shipping.
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder that investors have shifted their fancy from
online retailing to so-called business-to-business commerce, which
involves the market for raw goods, industrial parts and corporate
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once Wall Street finds that a business is not up to its
expectations, it just moves on to something else.'' said George
Orban, the chairman of Egghead, the online electronics retailer
that has tried to stay afloat in a tough business by merging with a
competitor, Onsale Inc. ``You're going to see a lot of businesses
flame out.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Nova, a partner with Highland Capital, a venture firm, said
the companies he had invested in _ including e-tailers like eToys
and Staples.com _ are hardly going to flame out. But some, he said,
certainly have had to modify their approaches in the current
investment climate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are dance partners to Wall Street, and they changed the
tempo,'' Nova said. ``Nine months ago, investment bankers were
telling us we were showing profits too early and not investing
enough in the brand. Now we have to scale back our plans to show
profits earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   This vulnerability to the fickle folly of Wall Street,
particularly when much of the market's tone is being set by online
day traders, highlights just how risky it was for these companies
to go public with little more than a Web site and a dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing the dark side of going public early,'' said Alec
L. Ellison, a merger specialist with Broadview, a New Jersey
investment bank. ``A lot of companies will have to be restructured
because they don't have a steady and patient source of capital.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris MacAskill, chief executive of Fatbrain.com, an online
professional bookstore, blames investment bankers and venture
capitalists for forcing his company to go public much too soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had we waited until we had a few more quarters under our belt,
we could have had a great public offering,'' he said. Fatbrain went
public in November 1998, with its share price closing near $25 the
first day. It is now at $10.8125. ``Your entrance to the grand
stage sets the standard for how you will be measured,'' MacAskill
said.
</P>
<P>
   But many other executives say they had no choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of companies are going public very early and are under
intense public scrutiny,'' CDNow's Diamond said. ``But I would do
it all over again,'' he said. ``We needed to go public to raise the
money to build a brand quickly.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Diamond was an executive at the music retailer N2K when it
raised $103 million in an initial public offering in October 1997.
CDNow, with which it merged early last year, raised $65 million
when it went public in February 1998. Each also raised more in
secondary offerings before their merger.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry executives now say it was better to have gone
public perhaps too soon than wait until now, when the changing mood
of Wall Street may have made it too late for other e-tailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going public was the best thing we could have done,'' said
Kenneth E. Kurtzman, the chief executive of Ashford.com, an online
jewelry store that went public with an $81 million offering last
September. ``We raised enough capital to see us until we get
profitable, and it established our name as the leader in the space.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even better,'' Kurtzman added, ``I felt like the door was
closing behind us. Our competitors are running out of cash, and
they can't go public.''
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists and investment bankers say it may be that
the only online retailers that are able to raise money in today's
market will be those affiliated with traditional retailers, like
Kmart, Wal-mart Stores and Toys ``R'' Us.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will never be a new stand-alone business-to-consumer
dot-com created again,'' predicted Robert Lessin, co-chief
executive of Wit Capital, a New York investment bank active in
Internet offerings. ``Three years ago, you could create a brand for
$10 million. Now it costs $1 billion. With the lifetime value of a
customer, it just doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   This judgment may be a bit too harsh, in the view of Michael
Moritz, a partner with Sequoia Capital, a Silicon Valley venture
firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that a lot of companies were formed and got
financed that didn't meet the great litmus test of being a good
business,'' he said. ``And people are only now waking up surprised
to find out what they had invested in. But a lot of nice, cherubic
little babies are being thrown out with the gray bathwater.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he argues, the babies, at least those in his
portfolio, will be rescued. ``I don't go to sleep at night worried
about cash,'' he said. ``Good companies can always raise money.''

`SOPRANOS' REMAINS BOSS AT SEASON'S END
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV:  Graphic  is being sent to NYT graphic clients.
Nonsubscribers can purchase one-time rights by calling 888-603-1036
or 888-346-9867.) 
 BY BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The mob family hit ``The Sopranos,'' burdened this season with
expectations heavier than cement shoes, finished its second burst
of 13 episodes Sunday night more than ever the biggest programming
phenomenon in HBO history.
</P>
<P>
   Ratings soared for ``The Sopranos'' in its second season,
climbing more than 60 percent _ even though the show did not
attract the season-long surge of media coverage that accompanied
its first season.
</P>
<P>
   Though the ratings are important, there is something broader at
stake for HBO, a unit of Time Warner. The cable channel does not
measure the success of its series in direct income. Because it is a
subscription channel dependent on monthly revenues from subscriber
fees, the prime consideration, HBO's top executive said, is selling
people on HBO in an increasingly crowded marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about ensuring that the pool of people who get HBO
like what we do,'' said Jeffrey L. Bewkes, the HBO chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Bewkes said he expected the channel to add 1 million to 2
million homes to its subscriber list this year. ``Is that all
because of `The Sopranos'?'' he said. ``We can't say that. But it
certainly helps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the business of trying to be the most-noticed network
on television,'' Bewkes said. ``And this show is right on target
for that goal.''
</P>
<P>
   But viewers who are going to miss their weekly Sunday night
appointment with Tony and Carmela Soprano and their extended family
(now minus a few members) are in for an extra-long wait. Though HBO
has now committed to another two seasons of episodes, Season 3 will
not be on the air until next March. The first two seasons started
in January.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, said Brad Grey, one of the show's executive
producers, was to give the show's creator and lead writer, David
Chase, more time to map out where he wants his characters to go.
``We made a deal to do 26 more episodes,'' Grey said. ``This gives
David the opportunity to think two seasons out at once. We're
probably not going back into production as soon this year.''
</P>
<P>
   In the previous two years, the show started production in July.
With the extra time, production may not start until late August.
That will delay the show's introduction on the air until March.
</P>
<P>
   Avid fans may have to content themselves with repeats of the
current season, which will play on HBO again in June, Bewkes said.
Season 1 may also come back, he said, though the channel has not
decided on that yet. And HBO could always bring back this year's
episodes one more time in a weeklong marathon before the start of
Season 3 as it did with Season 1 before this year's new episodes.
</P>
<P>
   Bewkes said HBO wanted to be careful with what it considers its
prize program. For that reason, the channel has resisted releasing
the episodes from the first seasons on videocassette and most
likely will still resist. But HBO has sold ``The Sopranos'' to
networks internationally with great success, Bewkes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without giving a full list,'' he said, ``it's safe to say the
show is available in most of the countries of the world that you'd
expect: almost everywhere in Europe and much of Asia and Latin
America.''
</P>
<P>
   HBO viewers have never liked anything as much as they like ``The
Sopranos.'' Last year, it became by far the highest-rated series in
the channel's history when it averaged an 8.3 rating, or about 4.4
million viewers, in HBO homes. (Last season, about 25 million homes
received HBO.)
</P>
<P>
   This season that rating climbed to a 13.6, or about 6.5 million
viewers. (The total number of homes is now about 27 million.) Both
figures were for only the initial weekly showings on Sunday nights.
The show was repeated on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
</P>
<P>
   Bewkes said that when the four showings were counted together,
about 13 million viewers a week were watching ``The Sopranos,'' or
close to half the homes that subscribe to HBO.
</P>
<P>
   ``The acceptance of the second season has been as intense or
even more intense than the first season,'' Grey said. ``The numbers
are proof of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Another indication is how much in demand the stars of the show
are. After turning down numerous offers to appear in movies during
last year's hiatus in shooting, James Gandolfini, who has emerged
as one of television's biggest stars with his performance as Tony,
is currently in the cast of a film called ``The Mexican.'' His
co-stars _ Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt _ are one indication of the
stature Gandolfini has attained.
</P>
<P>
   Edie Falco, who plays Carmela, has been starring in the play
``Sideman'' in London. Michael Imperioli, who plays Tony's nephew
Christopher, and Lorraine Bracco, who plays his psychiatrist, are
also shooting movies. Dominic Chianese, Uncle Junior, has signed to
do a play with Al Pacino.
</P>
<P>
   Grey noted that all the principal cast members (the ones whose
characters are still alive after Sunday night's episode) are signed
on for the new 26-episode deal.
</P>
<P>
   As for Chase, he has signed a deal to write and direct a film,
which he may or may not start this year. At the moment, he is
treating himself to a monthlong vacation in France.
</P>
<P>
   Most series that reach this level of success after two seasons
settle in for long runs. But Bewkes said HBO was not looking past
the next two seasons at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly can see this going several more seasons,'' he
said. ``But we don't sell commercials. We're not going to continue
making the show just because we could still take in a certain
amount of advertising revenue. We won't keep it going just to keep
it going. What we're interested in is being able to make the show
at the same level of quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Grey indicated that Chase might decide that two more years is
enough. ``David is committed to stay for those 26 more. We'll see
how much more we'll do, if any, after that. It may indeed go no
further.''

HISTORIANS TAKE A LONGER VIEW OF NET BATTLES
</HEADLINE>
   (ART ADV:  Graphic  is being sent to NYT graphic clients.
Nonsubscribers can purchase one-time rights by calling 888-603-1036
or 888-346-9867.) 
 By TERESA RIORDAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has been enmeshed in
controversy of late, with critics charging that it is awarding too
many patents that cover too much ground and questioning whether its
staff truly understands the technology it is evaluating.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com's recently awarded patent for one-click online
shopping has received much attention because of its breadth. But
Amazon is by no means the leader in Internet patents.
</P>
<P>
   America Online is sitting on at least 14. In fact, in recent
months AOL has received one patent that covers customizing online
shopping for individual shoppers and another for a system that will
``search all resources on the Internet with one search command.''
Scores of other Internet-related patents quietly tumble out of the
patent office each week.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, much of the current controversy about patents,
according to historians of technology and communications, lacks a
sense of historical context. They say the patent battles looming on
the Internet horizon have historical precedent in those that arose
with other innovations in communication, including the telegraph,
telephone, radio and television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see the development of the Internet as being
significantly different from the development of other
communications technologies since the 1840s,'' said Brian Winston,
the head of the School of Communication, Design and Media at the
University of Westminster in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``The creation of the Internet falls into a pattern. It's part
of that pattern that there will always be a terrible row over
patents.''
</P>
<P>
   Patent prospecting by Internet companies has been criticized in
a wide range of forums, from anonymous one-sentence postings on
slashdot.org, a Web site for computer programmers, to a scholarly
symposium conducted by the National Academy of Sciences in
February.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of these new Internet patents, which by definition have
a software component, contend that software creation is far more
incremental than other kinds of invention.
</P>
<P>
   But Winston and many historians of technology argue that most
invention builds on existing innovation, rather than being the
result of a singular insight. Furthermore, many people are often
developing the same ideas at the same time. This phenomenon, they
say, is by no means exclusive to software _ or to the present.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most extreme example of simultaneous development is when
you have Alexander Graham Bell and Elisha Gray arriving at the
patent office on the same day with the idea of the telephone,''
said Winston, who is the author of ``Media Technology and Society:
A History From the Telegraph to the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray and Bell settled their differences, with Gray getting a
$100,000 settlement and lucrative contract work. But the early days
of the telephone were marked by many other patent disputes. At one
point the Bell System had 600 pending patent infringement cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general conception of invention is probably epitomized by
the image of a light bulb going off over your head,'' said Robert
Rosenberg, director of the Thomas A. Edison Papers Project, a
documentary editing project based at Rutgers University. ``But
inventions come out of other people's work, they come out of your
own work. They are almost always incremental.''
</P>
<P>
   And when social conditions and technology are both ripe,
Rosenberg said, patents become vigorously contested precisely
because they are so valuable and so many similar ideas bubble up at
the same time.
</P>
<P>
   It may also be instructive to consider the example of Samuel
F.B. Morse and his first patent.
</P>
<P>
   Morse's contribution, to use anachronistic terms, was not so
much hardware as software. Others were inventing their own versions
of the telegraph, but Morse contributed the code _ putting dots and
dashes together so that information could be transmitted
efficiently, using electricity, over the new device.
</P>
<P>
   The historical precedent that most closely parallels the
development of the Internet is the evolution of radio, according to
the historian Amy Friedlander. She has written a series of
monographs on the development of large-scale infrastructures for a
nonprofit organization created by Robert Kahn, co-inventor of the
TCP/IP protocol that is at the heart of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``A radio patent pool was finally formed in 1919,'' said
Friedlander, who is the editor of iMP, an online journal of
technology and public policy. ``One of the reasons it was formed
was there were so many patents and so much cross-licensing that
development of radio had become almost sclerotic.''
</P>
<P>
   Although patents have often served as an important spur to
invention, she said, ``the capacity of patents to stifle innovation
is not new to our times.''
</P>
<P>
   The pendulum of history, just as everywhere, has its swings at
the patent office and in the courts that interpret patent law.
</P>
<P>
   Today, in addition to coming under fire for broad patents, the
patent office is roundly criticized for issuing patents that cover
dubious inventions like the physics-defying ``hyper-light-speed
antenna'' that serves as a portal to a ``new dimension.'' In
February, a patent was issued to a Colorado inventor for just such
a device.
</P>
<P>
   But in the mid-19th century, for example, Scientific American
published diatribes arguing exactly the opposite _ that the patent
office was far too stingy about handing out patents.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also contend that the patent office is issuing a number
of bad patents because it has become so technologically backward
that it cannot distinguish true innovation from fantastic theory or
hoary precedent.
</P>
<P>
   But for as long as it has existed, the patent office has been
confronted with new technology that may initially have sounded like
science fiction. ``The lag between the skills of the patent office
and innovation has been there a long time,'' said Philip Scranton,
a Rutgers professor who specializes in the history of industry and
technology. The watershed, according to Scranton, was not the
advent of software in the 20th century, but the electrical
inventions of the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``By inspecting mechanical drawings you can at least identify
what is similar between inventions, what is different and what
might be an infringement,'' he said. ``But with electrical
inventions arrived a whole new level of engineering and
mathematical considerations.''
</P>
<P>
   The most fundamental question that critics of Internet patents
pose is whether business models like the Amazon one-click process
should be patented at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been here before,'' said Winston, who sees no problem
with business-model patents. ``There's a whole tendency to look at
new technologies as being outside of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   But others say it may be a little too early to tell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are people going to look back a hundred years from now and
think that one-click ordering was a revolutionary model?'' said
Paul Ceruzzi, a historian at the Smithsonian Institution's National
Air and Space Museum and the author of ``A History of Modern
Computing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know,'' he said. ``We have to wait for the dust to
settle.''
</P>
<P>
   (Patents may be viewed at www.uspto.gov on the Web or may be
ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office, Washington 20231.)

   Bob Egan, a technology research executive, sounds jaded when
asked to predict the future of news delivery on cellular phones and
hand-held computers. ``You are entering this story at the moment of
maximum hype,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But then there are moments like this: on Sunday, after missing
his daughter's high school softball game because of a business
trip, Egan turned on his Palm Pilot hand-held organizer on a
beachfront boardwalk in San Diego and pulled in the news of the
team's victory and the favorable reviews of his daughter's pitching
from The Woonsocket Call in Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   From America Online and Microsoft to Reuters and The Associated
Press to The New York Times, E.W. Scripps' Knoxville News-Sentinel
and Knight Ridder's MercuryCenter.com, news and information
organizations are bringing their wares to the diminutive screens of
portable electronic devices. The new medium is something between a
curiosity and a business, and the media groups involved, still
trying to find their financial sea legs on the Internet, are
hesitant to predict how these services will pay for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a widespread consensus that consumers will develop
a taste for getting up-to-the-minute data on traffic and movies and
sports and even news while they are on the go. ``The value here is
that people are going to be able to get at personal and relevant
information services when they are traveling,'' Egan, a vice
president of the Gartner Group, said. Traveling, he added, does not
have to be business travel _ it could be ``travel between the PTA
and work or driving the kids around.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of news on tiny screens _ some so small they can
accommodate only 30 words at a time, others able to handle as many
as 150 words _ has been drawing gradually nearer for a decade,
starting with paging devices that transmitted headlines and
financial data from organizations like CNN, Bloomberg News and
ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   But the popularity of cellular phones and personal organizers
like Palm Pilots is soaring just as new technologies arrive to
transform them into mini-printing presses. So large numbers of
investors, analysts, telecommunications companies and news
providers are becoming convinced that, eventually, people who
hunger for news will be happy to get it fresh in bit-sized digital
chunks whenever they need it.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Sacks, senior vice president and general manager of AOL
Interactive Services, said, ``You could go out of your mind
listening to Elian Gonzalez stories, when all you want to know is
why did you see 16 ambulances down the road from your house.''
</P>
<P>
   Providing the answer to such a question is the eventual goal of
services like those offered by America Online and Access Atlanta,
the flagship Web site of the Cox Enterprises unit Cox Interactive
Media. Providing a constantly updated digest of general news is the
current practice of USAToday.com, Yahoo, Fox Sports, ABCNews.com,
Reuters and The Associated Press. Providing up-to-the-minute news
of stock prices, mergers and new technologies is the aim of a
myriad of business and technology news services.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to hardware and software, the corporate guests at
the wireless information party could fill a fair-sized hotel
ballroom. But, as with the Internet, the entire wireless
information industry is casting about for an economic model that
works.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Zollman, an analyst for the Advanced Interactive Media
Group, sees a bright spot, however, in the fact that these services
are so new that relatively few people are accustomed to getting
them for free. ``There has come to be on the Web an expectation
that content is free,'' he said. ``On the wireless devices, that
expectation has not been set yet.''
</P>
<P>
   One possible revenue stream, he said, could develop by offering
wireless information services ``free or at a reduced rate to people
who subscribe to the print edition'' of a newspaper. Another, Egan
said, would be charging a cell phone user not by the number of
minutes connected but by services received.
</P>
<P>
   Making a business out of all of this is the goal not only of
these news providers, but the software companies _ AvantGo, i3
Mobile, Aether Systems, InfoSpace.com, Phone.com, Microsoft's MSN
Mobile, AnyDevice.com and numerous others _ that serve as digital
clipping or delivery services. Their customers are likely to be the
manufacturers of the mobile devices.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the creators of the protocols and digital
languages _ like the Wireless Application Protocol, or WAP, and
Bluetooth, a radiowave-based protocol that allows hand-held devices
to talk to others nearby _ that are the ink of this on-the-go,
print-with-electrons process. And finally, there are the
infrastructure builders, like IBM, Nortel and Ericsson, and the
device makers _ Palm, Psion, Sharp, Motorola, Nokia _ and finally
telecommunications firms worldwide, from Sprint, AT&AMP;T and Bell
Atlantic's Verizon to Vodafone AirTouch and Japan's NTT DoCoMo.
</P>
<P>
   The small screens will simply be a technical and editing
challenge, not an impediment, to the growth of wireless news,
argues Mitchell Stephens, author of ``A History of News'' (Harcourt
Brace, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   ``News has adapted itself to all sorts of formats throughout its
history,'' Stephens, a professor of journalism and mass
communications at New York University, said. ``The very first
newspapers in Europe had very short, what we would almost call
telegraphic news items. When the telegraph came in, news compacted
itself to travel over those expensive lines. Then you had news on
zippers in Times Square. News has fit in all sorts of places and it
will fit here.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even in the infancy of the mobile news business, there are
distinctive cultural accents to the business. In the United States,
analysts say, hand-held ``personal companions'' _ the Palm Pilot
has 68 percent of the worldwide market _ have become the early
favorite among wireless news delivery devices, picking up where the
abbreviated paging devices, with their sports-and-stock-bulletin
capacity, left off. In Europe and Japan, users prefer cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   Extending out from its U.S. base, the Palm is gaining a toehold
in the rest of the world. Currently, according to Michael Mace,
chief competitive officer for Palm Inc., there are about 6.5
million devices with the Palm operating system worldwide _ the vast
majority of them Palm Pilots. His company shipped 3 million in
1999, he said, double the rate of the previous year. An increase of
40 percent over 1999 sales sales is forecast for 2000 but, Mace
said, the sales in the first quarter of 2000 were more than double
the number in the comparable period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But these figures are dwarfed by the sales of cellular phones _
about 275 million worldwide last year. About 1 billion cellular
phones will be in use by 2003, according to several research
estimates _ though a much smaller number will be able to tap into
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how many users are getting access to the Internet
through these devices is still hard to measure, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of intermediate firms, which provide data to wireless
devices, grows weekly. Of those serving the Palm, AvantGo is among
the best known, offering services for free to users of the
hand-held devices and hoping to earn its keep with a portion of the
revenues the media companies earn from the new mobile readers.
</P>
<P>
   Felix Lin, founder and chairman of AvantGo, said the company was
founded at about the same time as the first batch of Palm Pilots
was shipped in 1996. By developing alliances with media companies
like the News Corp.'s Fox unit, stock tracking services like Stock
Smart, and other sources of information _ providers of maps, ski
resort information, restaurant and movie listings, games,
horoscopes and the like _ AvantGo has developed an inventory of
hundreds of ``channels'' that mobile device owners can receive when
they log in, either through synchronization devices that reach the
Internet through desktop computers, or through wireless antennas.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe and Japan, cellular telephones became popular far
earlier than in the United States. The development of the Wireless
Application Protocol, simplifying the delivery of news to these
devices, coupled with the pervasiveness of cellular phones, have
made these devices the instrument of choice to receive news on the
go, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   But most existing phones can only receive short messages. Scott
Woefel, general manager and editor in chief of CNN.com, said 41
million cellular phone users could get news, sports and financial
data from CNN, but he did not know what fraction of this group
actually subscribed to CNN's service.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the network has a full-time staff dedicated to
reformatting its news reports for pagers and cellular phones, 24
hours a day. Separately, the company, like many other news
organizations, has a deal with AvantGo, through which a portion of
its Web site's content can be transferred to hand-held devices
running on the Palm Pilot operating system, or its rivals,
Microsoft's Windows CE and Symbian's EPOC.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is part of our bigger strategy,'' Woefel said.
Delivery of CNN news, he said, should come in ``three primary ways
_ TV in the home, a computer in the office, and one of these
hand-held devices everywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to align ourselves too closely with one
technology or one company,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Reuters, too, is pushing for predominance in mobile information,
both through the news and financial data it supplies to Web sites
and through investments in companies like Phone.com, Yahoo and
Aether, according to Jonathan Baile, managing director of Reuters
Wireless Services.
</P>
<P>
   David Wachtel, publisher of Bloomberg Media, said the type of
news delivered would be determined in part by the device involved.
``The idea that people are going to read their entire newspaper
over the phone is wrong,'' he said. ``But quick bits of information
in a hurry, yes.''
</P>
<P>
   The editing of news for hand-held devices is becoming a
necessary skill at news Web sites. Several providers, like
Space.com. CNet's News.com, The New York Times and many Knight
Ridder newspapers offer a bouquet of eight to 20 headlines and
summaries, sometimes grouped under categories like sports and
entertainment. When a user clicks on a headline, a full story or
commentary becomes available.
</P>
<P>
   Other news providers, like The Financial Times' site, ft.com,
and USAToday.com offer streamlined, 250- or 300-word articles but
cover a broader range of subjects. News.com, like CNNfn and ESPN,
provide updates frequently; the articles can be brief or as long as
800 words.
</P>
<P>
   In general, financial and sports offerings, from sites like The
Wall Street Journal's wsj.com and espn.com, are much more likely to
be kept current. Gannett's USAToday.com is one of several general
news providers that offer updates on most topics throughout the
day. The New York Times offering of front page articles on Avantgo,
which are not updated, is the service's most requested channel,
Avantgo executives say.
</P>
<P>
   But it is often the most prosaic information that is the most
popular. Through AvantGo, the Web site of The Knoxville News
Sentinel offers detailed traffic reports, and Access Atlanta offers
weather bulletins that can be urgent during tornado season.
</P>
<P>
   But Jonathan Bell, Knoxville's senior Web designer, said, ``The
thing people are asking us for are movie times.''

E-COMMERCE REPORT: MALL DEVELOPERS FIGHT BACK AT THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind., Ga.)   By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Late last year, amid the hype of dot-com retailing and the
run-up in e-commerce stocks, Web merchants had a lot of fun at the
expense of shopping malls.
</P>
<P>
   When they were not explicitly stating that mall shopping was a
complete waste of time and money, they implied it. Analysts piled
on as well, some predicting that e-tailers would bring about the
demise of the mall altogether. Mall developers could do little but
watch their stock prices sink, and hope people came to their
senses.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the airwaves less crowded by consumer e-commerce
advertisements and with investors fleeing Web merchants en masse,
Internet retailers suddenly seem a lot more vulnerable _ and malls
are poised for a counteroffensive.
</P>
<P>
   The United States' biggest mall developers, like General Growth
Properties and Simon Property Group, have ratcheted up their own
e-commerce strategies in recent months. Putting a new spin on
so-called clicks and mortar strategies, they are vying to fill the
gaps left by both traditional and Internet retailers, in areas like
electronic ordering and customer service.
</P>
<P>
   Their efforts may not slow the Internet shopping trend, but they
will at least ensure that the malls get a piece of the e-commerce
pie, and perhaps guarantee malls' continued relevance in the retail
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that among all mall owners, Simon Property Group
has been the most aggressive in pushing its e-commerce strategies.
The Indianapolis-based company is the nation's largest mall
developer, with more than 200 shopping malls, including the
behemoth Mall of America near Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Simon created two separate business units,
Clixnmortar and TenantConnect.net, to enable shoppers to integrate
e-commerce into their trips to the mall. Through TenantConnect,
Simon is installing broadband Internet connections inside its own
malls and those of other developers, so that store merchants can
have high-speed access to the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, retailers may take part in two Clixnmortar
initiatives now under development: FastFrog.com, which is designed
for teen-agers, and YourSherpa.com, which is intended for adult
users.
</P>
<P>
   In both programs, shoppers carry hand-held scanners through the
mall, zapping items they are interested in buying. When shoppers
are finished, the items appear on a wish list in a mall Internet
kiosk for FastFrog, or on a shopper's check-out page at a different
Internet kiosk for YourSherpa.
</P>
<P>
   From the FastFrog kiosks, teen-agers can forward their wish
lists to friends and relatives. At the YourSherpa kiosks, users can
type in their credit-card numbers and check out immediately, or
delay the final purchase until they go home and log onto a
YourSherpa Web site. Either way, YourSherpa shoppers are given the
option of picking up the items at the mall or having them wrapped
and delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, mall owners get no cut of the sale, as the proceeds
go entirely to the merchant whose store sells the product.
According to Shannon Haslund, vice president of operations for
Clixnmortar, the compensation details could change later. But for
now, mall owners are operating the kiosks primarily to generate
foot traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Haslund said FastFrog had been in tests at two Atlanta malls
since November, while a test run of YourSherpa.com began in
December in Atlanta's Lenox Square Mall, with one retailer, FAO
Schwarz. Based on the success of both programs, the company hopes
to roll them out nationally by the end of the year, she said.
</P>
<P>
   John Condon, manager of the FAO Schwarz in the Lenox Square
Mall, said YourSherpa had been ``tremendously valuable'' to the
store. Nearly all of the 700 shoppers who picked up a scanning
device from the YourSherpa kiosk have made purchases. The average
YourSherpa order, Condon said, was between $180 and $200, compared
with about $60 for an average store order.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, he said, no merchandise had been returned from
YourSherpa purchases, compared with an average return rate of about
8 percent for store purchases. ``People don't have to finalize the
purchase right then,'' Condon said. ``It gives you a little more
time to decide. And you're not constrained by how much you can
carry.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   General Growth Properties, the nation's second-largest mall
developer, is also moving quickly to capitalize on the Internet,
according to John Bucksbaum, the company's chief executive. ``We
were fairly certain that the Internet wouldn't result in our
demise, since we didn't think people would quit going out to do
their shopping,'' he said. ``So we asked, `How can we turn this
into an opportunity?'''
</P>
<P>
   The answer was Mallibu.com. The Web site will eventually link to
retailers in each of the company's 136 malls, allowing shoppers to
buy goods online directly from those retailers and have them
dropped off by a delivery service. Mallibu, which will begin
offering transactions online in June, also enables General Growth
to capitalize on one of the Internet's strengths: data tracking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazon knows more about one customer after one trip than we do
about a person who comes in year after year,'' Bucksbaum said. By
tracking purchases online and obtaining e-mail addresses through
registrations, he said, ``we'll be able to e-mail a person about
new items coming into the store, or sales.''
</P>
<P>
   General Growth will charge retailers an amount not yet
determined for plugging into the malls' Mallibu.com Internet
systems, which are being installed, but it will not take a
commission from each sale. Still, the company could benefit from
any incremental Web sales, Bucksbaum said, since General Growth,
like other mall developers, takes between 4 percent and 8 percent
of a retailer's total sales beyond a certain level.
</P>
<P>
   According to Elaine Rubin, chairwoman of Shop.org, an Internet
retailing trade group, the efforts of Simon and General Growth
Properties ``are enlightening many other folks in the real estate
business.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes nonmall shopping centers. According to Charlotte
Ellis, senior vice president of Konover Property Trust, one of the
nation's largest developers of shopping centers that are not
enclosed malls, the company has begun to install high-speed
Internet lines in its 152 retail centers across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Konover plans to offer free Internet service
by year-end to users who agree to have their local shopping center
serve as their home page. Ellis said the border of the user's
screen would probably include advertisements and links to those
local retailers, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers might eventually order goods from the local retailers,
she said, and then pick them up or have them delivered. And while
Konover is passing along some of the costs of the program to its
retailers, the company is making a ``large'' undisclosed investment
upfront to start things off. ``In the meantime, it immediately sets
us apart from our competition,'' Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   The effort also continues to stretch the notion of Internet
shopping into something that few thought it would be even six
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shopping really hasn't changed much in 5,000 years,'' Ellis
said. ``We know there are going to be some big changes because of
the Internet, but ultimately it'll all be about saving time.''

NEW ECONOMY: INTERNET SCENE MAY HAVE A LOT IN COMMON WITH THE
'60S  
 BY LESLIE KAUFMAN  
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Joshua White, the vibe at Pseudo.com, the dot-com enterprise
where he is employed these days, is amusingly reminiscent of a
different era: the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   White is a senior vice president in charge of production at
Pseudo, a company that creates original off-beat shows on
everything from the space program to hip-hop music to broadcast
over the Web. The struggle of the young staff to use the developing
medium in ways uniquely suited to the Internet strikes him as a
perfect parallel to his own life in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   That year, White was a 25-year-old lighting artist who went to
work for the rock promoter Bill Graham at the Fillmore East theater
in Manhattan's East Village. White's job and his passion were to
create light shows to match the kinetic new rock music emerging
from artists like the Grateful Dead and Jimi Hendrix. He was at the
center of cultural change, and it felt good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't chasing after anything traditional,'' he recalls. His
job, after all, was something no one had done before.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was this feeling among those that were in it,'' he
added, ``that we were involved in something that older people would
not get. And then, like now, everyone over 30 is an outsider. They
come by and want to be part of it, but they just don't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   What is it about the zeitgeist of the Internet of today that
keeps calling to mind the radical 1960s? Let's have no illusions:
The two decades are decidedly at odds in terms of ideology.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier era was defined by a rejection of prevailing social
norms, from segregation to sexual modesty to name a few. Today's
dot-com babies think about transforming commerce not values and
mores. And they are working happily within establishment parameters
to do it, fighting not in the streets but on the Street.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, dropping out meant dodging the draft and moving to
Canada to join a farming collective. Today, it means skipping out
of college before graduation to join a technology start-up and cash
in on millions of options.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sense of empowerment is the same,'' Vern Keenan, who runs
a San Francisco Internet consulting firm, observes dryly, ``but the
politics is very different. Then the group party was socialism; now
it is libertarianism.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for their obvious differences, the two eras are linked in
the psyches of many. Part of the connection is that many of the
Net's founding fathers came from the crucible of rebellion culture
in California _ Steve Wozniak of Apple Computer and Bill Joy of Sun
Microsystems to drop two prominent names. But the similarities run
deeper than that.
</P>
<P>
   Most obviously, the Internet is a radically youth-centric
culture, convinced that dewy college graduates can better see the
future than those already tainted by their role in the old economy.
Surely, the hippie slogan, ``Don't trust anyone over 30,'' is as
apt for this emerging generation as it was for the 20-something
protesters who coined it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the university there is an inverse correlation between age
and experience,'' said Clay Shirky, a professor of new media at
Hunter College. ``The younger they are, the better they are at
speaking the new language. So undergraduates know more than
graduates, and freshmen know more than seniors _ all of which
really upsets the traditional order.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also an aura of vitality and era-defining importance
around the activities of those who are plugged into the new economy
_ only some of which was lost in the recent stock market slide. It
is a common refrain for reporters to hear people talk about not
wanting to be bystanders to the digital revolution, as if working
for a dot-com is on par with going to Haight-Ashbury to drop acid
during the Summer of Love.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Skeen is one of those mid-30-somethings drawn to the new
economy, in part, for the scene. Last month, Skeen left a
comfortable job at the publishing side of GQ, the men's magazine
published by Conde Nast to join Powerful Media Inc., whose
soon-to-be-introduced Web site Inside.com, aims to be a must-read
news service for media professionals. He is thrilled to have left
the polished Times Square offices of the big publishing company for
an enormous warehouse building on 11th Avenue, where numerous new
media enterprises make their home and the elevators are packed with
gadget-porting post-pubescents. ``It is an incredible
counterculture going on here,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Skeen also sees the 1960s in his adventures. He equates, for
example, the lure of money in the 1990s to the lure of drugs in the
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Locke, co-author of ``The Cluetrain Manifesto,'' (Perseus
Books, 2000), a polemic that is rising quickly on the best-seller
lists, argues that the Internet revolution is the logical heir to
the 1960s on another front: communications.
</P>
<P>
   The 1960s saw giant strides toward the democratization of
information, Locke argues, pointing to alternative publications
like Rolling Stone and journalists like the great Gonzo himself.
``Hunter Thompson was writing about what he was engaged in,'' Locke
said. ``He was not pretending to be objective or out of context.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web, in Locke's view, brings the revolution against the
sonorous all-knowing corporate voice to its inevitable climax and
resolution in favor of the plebeians. ``The Internet enables people
to talk directly to each other and to corporations,'' he said. ``It
is something businesses ignore at their own peril.''
</P>
<P>
   Heavy, man, heavy.

MAGAZINE INTENDS TO GROW WITH THE INTERNET ECONOMY
</HEADLINE>
  By COURTNEY KANE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a time when swings in technology stocks are feeding a debate
about the Internet economy, The Industry Standard, a magazine
devoted to e-commerce, is starting a campaign to attract a broader
range of readers.
</P>
<P>
   When the magazine began in April 1998, it was aimed at the
people who were responsible for developing and putting into effect
their companies' Internet strategy. As e-commerce has exploded, so
too has that pool of potential readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more people now who need the kind of information
we've been providing,'' said Kerry G. Zeida, vice president for
marketing and brand development for Standard Media in San
Francisco, which publishes The Industry Standard.
</P>
<P>
   The $10 million television and outdoor campaign _ the magazine's
first _ comes at a time when circulation growth is already strong.
The Industry Standard's circulation has risen to 150,000 from
60,000 when it began. The number of advertising pages, marketing
everything from alcohol to cars to technology, has grown even
faster: to 1,678.12 pages in the fourth quarter of last year from
251.17 pages in the fourth quarter of 1998, an increase of 568
percent, according to the tracking service Adscope Inc. in Eugene,
Ore.
</P>
<P>
   While researching an angle to speak to the magazine's expanded
audience, Zeida said the magazine found that its readers appreciate
a competitive advantage they get from reading the publication.
Three 30-second commercials, which start Monday, take that notion
to a humorous extreme by showing Internet business leaders making
an effort to keep the information they get from The Industry
Standard confidential.
</P>
<P>
   In one spot, two men are seated at tables in a nondescript cafe,
with their backs to one another. In a spoof of spy movies, the two
exchange a series of quirky code phrases to assure each other that
they have the right contact: ``Does your wife sleep in the nude?''
``Actually she prefers flannel.'' ``Little Bo Peep has lost her
sheep.'' ``Leave them alone and they'll come home.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the two exchange their top-secret information. One man
quickly passes the magazine, which is concealed in a folder, to the
other and says, ``See you next week.''
</P>
<P>
   A second commercial features a man hustling to enter an empty
elevator. As he starts to open The Industry Standard magazine he
feels the presence of a security camera and backs up out of its
range. He then takes out a can of spray paint and blackens the
lens. Both spots close with an announcer saying: ``Read it. Learn
from it. Don't let it fall into the wrong hands,'' followed by the
company's tagline, ``The Industry Standard. Your weekly
intelligence report on the Internet economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercials will begin running Monday in 10 markets,
including Atlanta, Dallas, Miami, New York and San Francisco,
during cable business programs including those of Bloomberg News,
CNBC, CNN and MSNBC. The work is the first from TBWA/Chiat/Day in
Playa del Rey, Calif., part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of the
Omnicom Group, since that agency was awarded the account in
January.
</P>
<P>
   In the spots, ``we're saying this magazine is just chock full of
information all geared toward the Internet economy,'' said Jerry
Gentile, managing partner and creative director at TBWA/Chiat/Day.
``I think what we've tried to do is to personify it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of don't let it fall into the wrong hands,'' he
added, is one of ``making this your edge to e-commerce, trying to
make everybody feel they have their own little personal source to
understand e-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   The outdoor portion of the campaign will feature billboards in
New York and San Francisco. One ad is a spectacular, a gigantic
electronic display located just off the Bay Bridge en route to San
Francisco. That billboard features an enlarged masthead of The
Industry Standard, accompanied by a live feed of
Internet-business-related news headlines for commuters.
</P>
<P>
   Other billboards show a copy of the magazine accompanied by
headlines including, ``We never met a bubble we couldn't burst''
and ``Sugar coating is for cereal.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign for the magazine is the first component of what
will become a branding campaign to promote the entire company,
Standard Media. Subsequent ads for the other ventures and services
will be introduced later this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Standard Media, which is referred to simply as, ``The
Standard,'' is majority-owned by International Data Group. The
company also produces a Web site (www.TheStandard.com) and 18
online newsletters including Media Grok, in addition to hosting
national and international conferences and events.

KEEPING WORLD SAFE FOR COMFY UNDERWEAR  
 MEDIA MUSEUM STARTS AN INTERNET COLLECTION  
 SOCIALIST REALISM: TAKING TO THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: The Dav spelling in the fifth graf is correct.) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Holy Fruit of the Loom! There is an anti-Harry Potter, and he is
faster than a snapping waistband, more powerful than boxer shorts.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Underpants may not have a big-time movie deal, adult
respect or a Nimbus 2000 broom, but the tales of his search for
``truth, justice and all that is preshrunk and cottony'' are
stealthily gaining popularity against the more mainstream Potter.
</P>
<P>
   The two characters share the same children's publisher,
Scholastic Inc., which has issued more than six million copies of
books in the series of epic novels featuring Captain Underpants.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth volume in this irreverent series _ ``Captain
Underpants and the Perilous Plot of Professor Poopypants'' _ has
climbed to No. 2 behind Harry Potter on the Book Sense children's
best-seller list, based on early April sales compiled from more
than 300 independent booksellers across the country. Still to come:
``Captain Underpants and the Wrath of the Wicked Wedgie Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   For the uninitiated, Captain Underpants is actually a cranky
school principal by day who is transformed into a superhero with a
3-D hypno ring wielded by George Beard and Harold Hutchins, chronic
troublemakers at Jerome Horwitz Elementary. The guidance counselor
suspects the pranksters suffer from attention deficit disorder,
much like the author, Dav Pilkey, 34, who said severe hyperactivity
was diagnosed during what he calls the ``dark ages'' of his early
schooling.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, expectations were rather modest for the literary
future of Captain Underpants when he first emerged in the adult
world in 1997. (A primitive version of Captain U. actually leaped
from Pilkey's pencil when he was a second grader in 1973.)
Scholastic printed just 35,000 copies of the first volume and then
watched the word spread through school fairs, where Captain
Underpants was a subversive favorite among students who could
select the books themselves. The books were particularly popular
with boys 7 to 10 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Now executives at Scholastic are moving ahead with a novel
marketing effort. Toilet plungers were passed out to the company's
sales representatives when Scholastic introduced ``Captain
Underpants and the Attack of the Talking Toilets.'' Custom toilet
paper, emblazoned with the distinctive C.U. logo, was lavished on
booksellers to promote their hero. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MEDIA MUSEUM STARTS AN INTERNET COLLECTION  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anyone can go to the Museum of Television and Radio in New York
City and watch Richard Nixon's ``Checkers'' speech, listen to radio
episodes of ``The Green Hornet'' or watch Coca-Cola's ``I'd Like to
Teach the World to Sing'' commercials.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the museum will add another medium to its 100,000
hours of radio and television archives. It will announce Monday
that it has formed a partnership with RealNetworks, an Internet
company whose products deliver audio and video content over the
World Wide Web, to create an archive of Internet content and data.
</P>
<P>
   But just exactly how will the museum's curators decide what to
preserve from the great electronic sea? Will they preserve, for
example, the stomach-stapling operation of Carnie Wilson, the pop
singer, broadcast last year on AdoctorinyourHouse.com? America
Online's home page? Anything from The Drudge Report?
</P>
<P>
   Robert M. Batscha, the museum's president, said the same
criteria that apply to collecting television and radio material
would apply to the collection of archives from the Internet. The
three criteria, he said, were artistic excellence, historical
significance and social impact. (Which taken together do not
necessarily explain why the museum has an archived copy of the
``Star Trek'' episode ``The Trouble with Tribbles,'' but no
matter.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We will collect what we consider great work,'' Batscha said.
``And as we have television material about the Kennedy
assassination and presidential inaugurations and things like that,
we will look at how historical events on the Internet are
transmitted. And we will look at social impact, societal changes,
attitudes toward minorities and women.''
</P>
<P>
   Batscha said that the curatorial staff of the museum, which now
employs three full-time curators of television and radio, would
hire additional staff members to surf the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``To use television as an analogy, we are in the kinescope age
of the Internet, and we are lucky to begin collecting now,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Has any material been chosen yet? Batscha said some work that
Tom Fontana (the writer for the television programs ``Homicide''
and ''The Beat'') has written for the Internet has already been
selected, as well as some animation.
</P>
<P>
   What about the Starr report on President Clinton's relationship
with Monica Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't be any more specific,'' he said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   SOCIALIST REALISM: TAKING TO THE WEB
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is one class of magazines for which reaching a 76th
birthday is a sign that a publication is still a youngster. They
are the stalwart political journals. On both the right and the
left, periodicals like The Nation, National Review, The Progressive
and The New Leader, despite operating on the margins of
profitability, have continued to publish decade in and decade out,
regardless of which way the political winds are wafting.
</P>
<P>
   This year, The New Leader _ founded in 1924 as a successor to
New York City's Socialist daily newspaper, The Call _ marks its
anniversary by doing what most of the other political journals have
already done. Bowing to the call of the Internet, the magazine,
which combines political essays with book reviews and broad
cultural reporting, is starting a Web site, while at the same time
cutting back its print publication schedule to every two months
from every two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But the executive editor, Myron Kolatch, rather than sounding
ecstatic about forging into new territory, said he was distinctly
unhappy about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we thought that we ought to in some way adjust to what
is sometimes called the `communications revolution,' '' Kolatch
said, his voice separating out the words ``communications
revolution'' with disdain. ``So despite my intense skepticism about
it, we are now going to have a Web site.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kolatch acknowledged that the Web site would probably help
keep him in touch with readers. That is something the magazine will
now have to do with special care because with the March/April issue
The New Leader, which Kolatch says has a a circulation of about
15,000, will be published less frequently.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought the magazine would have perhaps greater depth and a
little more heft as well,'' Kolatch said. ``And it would appear
less often so people who are now involved in reading everything off
the Internet would not find this uncomfortable. Basically, our
feeling was that magazines of this kind, general magazines, are
somewhat in a state of limbo, so we thought we'd do something to
shake it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, coming late to the Internet game has its price. The
Web name ``newleader.com'' was already taken by ``some company in
California that trains middle management,'' Kolatch said.
</P>
<P>
   The New Leader's Web site, which will be introduced in the fall,
will be called Newleadermag.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care,'' Kolatch said. ``I am not convinced people will
read it online anyway.'' &QL;

PEN IS TO HONOR TWO IMPRISONED POETS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)   By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At the PEN American Center's annual literary gala on
Monday evening at Lincoln Center, there will be a pause as two
imprisoned poets, Dr. Flora Brovina, an ethnic Albanian in Kosovo,
and Xue Deyun, who is Chinese, are honored in absentia.
</P>
<P>
   Brovina and Xue will receive PEN/Barbara Goldsmith
Freedom-to-Write Awards. Each award carries a stipend of $3,000,
but the honor's primary purpose is to call attention to writers who
are imprisoned or in danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``These awards put a human face on the high price that writers
continue to pay for expressing themselves freely,'' Michael
Roberts, the executive director of the PEN American Center, said in
an interview. ``Since the awards were established in 1987, 14 of
the 20 writers in prison at the time of the award have been
released within a short time. In some cases it has been
immediately, and in other cases it has been weeks or months.''
</P>
<P>
   PEN, an organization of authors, editors and translators founded
in 1921 to promote free expression, sends out appeals by prominent
members, coordinates missions to countries where writers are in
jeopardy and promotes awareness of the dangers of censorship. The
Freedom-to-Write Awards are underwritten by the author Barbara
Goldsmith.
</P>
<P>
   One of Monday night's honorees, Brovina, 53, is not only a poet
but a pediatrician and founder and president of the League of
Albanian Women in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   After war broke out in Kosovo, she remained in Pristina, running
a shelter for women and children. On April 22, 1999, eight masked
Serbian paramilitaries abducted her from an apartment and held her
incommunicado for two weeks. Eventually she was accused of
``terrorist acts,'' and in December a Serbian court sentenced her
to 12 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Brovina's supporters say she was forced to sign a confession
that said she had participated in the Kosovo Liberation Army. In
January her lawyer filed an appeal with the Serbian Supreme Court
asserting that her rights to due process had been violated.
</P>
<P>
   In prison Brovina has only been able to shout to visitors from a
distance, and in front of guards. Her 18-year-old son, Ylli Begu,
an exchange student at Richland College in Dallas, is scheduled to
attend the ceremony Monday night. In an interview from Texas, Begu
said that his father, Agri Begu, an economist and banker, had
visited his mother three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Brovina has angina and needs to be hospitalized, her son said,
adding, ``She's being held in prison without medicine and proper
doctors.'' He also said that Brovina's Albanian lawyer had been
beaten by Serbian police officers, and had been hospitalized. Agri
Begu, in Pristina, could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   In China, Xue was at the center of a cultural revival in the
southwestern province of Guizhou.
</P>
<P>
   Xue, 40, was arrested on Jan. 26, 1998, with three other poets,
Ma Quiang, Wu Ruohai and Xiong Jinren (also known as Xiong Xiang),
in the provincial capital of Guiyang. They were about to publish a
new literary journal, China Cultural Renaissance, which advocates
freedom of literary expression. Chinese dissidents say that the
men's homes were raided without a warrant and their writings and
address books were confiscated.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the poets were released, but Xue, who writes under the
name Ma Zhe, was charged and convicted in the Guiyang Municipal
People's Court of ``engaging in subversive activities'' and
attempting to overthrow ``the socialist system by rumor-mongering
(or) slander.'' He was sentenced to seven years in prison. Xue had
been imprisoned from 1987 to 1990 because of his involvement in the
Beijing student protests of December 1986.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In an interview from Boston, the exiled Chinese writer Meng
Lang, a close friend of Xue, said that Chinese dissidents in the
United States did not know which prison has Xue.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this moment there is no way to communicate with anybody who
has seen Xue,'' said Meng, who is the executive editor of The
Tendency, a Chinese-language literary journal in Boston. ``Though
the Chinese Constitution has stated that Chinese people have the
freedom to organize, to publish, to speak, they have never carried
it out.''

<P>
   YUGOSLAV-TRIBUNAL (The Hague, Netherlands) _ Confounding the
many critics who long called the international tribunal here a mere
fig leaf for Western shame, the court dealing with Yugoslav war
crimes has just completed an extraordinary month. It has opened the
first U.N. trial ever to focus exclusively on sexual violence
against women, such as gang rape and the use of women as sexual
slaves as part of war strategy. It has also begun the trial of one
of the top generals alleged to be responsible for the carnage in
1995 at the Bosnian town of Srebrenica, probably Europe's worst
massacre of civilians since World War II. By Marlise Simons.
</P>
<P>
   RAMPAGE-KILLERS-II (Undated) _ Shots explode at a school in
Oregon or a brokerage office in Atlanta, and the nation is witness
to a sudden violent rampage. The killers' neighbors and families
submit to interviews, and inevitably, they say: ``He just
snapped.'' But the killers do not ``just snap.'' An examination by
The New York Times of 100 rampage murders found that most of the
killers spiraled down a long slow slide, mentally and emotionally.
Most of them left a road map of red flags. But in case after case,
the warning signs were missed. Second of four parts. By Laurie
Goodstein and William Glaberson.
</P>
<P>
   (With graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   NY-SPRINGSNOW (Undated) _ On Saturday, golf courses were filled
with duffers in shirt sleeves. On Sunday, they were filled with
sledders in snowsuits. In a post-winter storm, eastern and northern
New York were hit with most of the snow. Albany had 12 inches by 2
p.m., when the storm started to subside. The snow at one point in
and around Albany during the early morning fell at 2 inches an
hour, according to the National Weather Service. (Summary from
wires.)
</P>
<P>
   SECONDHAND-STORES (Undated) _ There have always been shoppers
who reveled in picking up what others discarded. But a new wave of
customers is elevating secondhand stores to pillars of retailing.
Americans spent some $17 billion on secondhand merchandise in 1999,
up 23 percent from the year before. Online auctioneers such as eBay
are making such shopping fashionable, and vendors are helping as
well: Goodwill has even added coffee bars and couches to the used
book sections of some stores. By Leslie Kaufman.
</P>
<P>
   STATE-BUDGETS-SURPLUS (Lansing, Mich.) _ Lawmakers here and in
many other states, now writing their budgets for the 2001 fiscal
year, are witnessing the biggest of six consecutive years of rising
revenues, inspiring inventive new ways to spend money and wave upon
wave of tax reductions. ``The states are overflowing with money and
spending a lot of money,'' said Stephen Moore, an economist at the
conservative Cato Institute. ``You are starting to see _ among
Republican governors, by the way _ budget increases of 6, 7, 8
percent a year.'' By Peter T. Kilborn.
</P>
<P>
   SILICON-GEEKS (Palo Alto, Calif.) _ This is one of the few
places in the Western Hemisphere where men outnumber women. Santa
Clara County has 68,000 more single men than women. And San Jose,
which competes with Palo Alto for the right to call itself the
epicenter of Silicon Valley, has a larger surplus of single men
than anywhere in the country. Given that the Valley is also the
land of the highest-educated, highest paid workers in the world _
single women should be having a ball. But Silicon Valley is a weird
world, unto itself. By Evelyn Nieves.
</P>
<P>
   CHILD-WARRIORS (Suan Phum, Thailand) _ Between them, the
12-year-old twins command 400,000 invisible soldiers. If anybody
shoots at them, the bullets just bounce off. And they can kill
their enemies simply by pointing a rifle at the ground and
concentrating really hard. It sounds like the fantasy of a million
schoolboys. But it is a belief that has led grown men into battle
behind the two child warriors who lead a ragged ethnic insurgency
called God's Army, just across the border in Myanmar, the former
Burma. By Seth Mydans.

 BY CAROL SHIELDS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One day I ran into an acquaintance at a shopping mall. She had
just bought herself a beautiful new spruce-green nightgown, and she
opened her bag an inch or two, so I might admire it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And now,'' she said, ``I must rush off to buy some matching
candles.'' I must have looked bewildered because she immediately
explained, ``Oh, I have candles to match all my nightgowns.''
</P>
<P>
   I was in the midst of a novel at the time, as I usually am, and
I couldn't resist putting in this particular report from the
Frontier of Real Life. I relish such curious glimpses into people's
lives, flashes of uniqueness that reveal, in a blink of the eye,
their extraordinary otherness.
</P>
<P>
   But months later, when I came to read the proofs for the novel,
I took the candles-and-nightgown reference out. My friend would be
sure to read the book, and certainly she would recognize herself,
since she must be the only person in the Western Hemisphere who
carries color coordination to this extreme. The excision cost me a
sigh of regret. But it preserved our acquaintance, and perhaps
avoided a storm of self-consciousness on her part. For I am
convinced that no one wants to make an appearance in someone else's
fiction, whether in the guise of a slightly demented shopper or
equipped with heroic raiment.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this reluctance to be expropriated has its roots in the
old legend about the camera stealing the souls of its subjects. But
it is more likely to be, for me at least, an issue of privacy and
the casual violation of another person's integrity, not to mention
the possibility of lawsuits, parents suing their children or
children suing a parent. Whether court actions succeed or fail,
whether time will or won't erase an injury of invasion, it is hard
to imagine there will ever be a scene of forgiveness between writer
and victim and a return to normal relations.
</P>
<P>
   Is it worth it? Every novelist will reply differently.
</P>
<P>
   I made up my mind at the beginning of my writing life not to
write about my family and friends, since I want them to remain my
family and friends. Others, it seems, have come to a similar
conclusion. The novelist Robertson Davies was once asked why he had
waited until age 60 before writing his marvelous Deptford Trilogy.
There was a long pause, and then he replied, haltingly, ``Well,
certain people died, you see.''
</P>
<P>
   Novelists inevitably arrive at a recipe for their work: so many
parts observation and experience, combined with so many degrees of
commitment to imagination. Stir well in a projected or real
universe. Hope for a reader who understands what fiction really is
and a critic who resists tying fictional gestures to autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   Novelists tend to be clumsy with the question of where their
material comes from. They shrug and blow out their cheeks in the
French manner, dismissive, skeptical, unwilling to be caught out.
 &UR; ``Well, yes, it is true I spent a winter in Algeria, true enough
that I met an exiled Korean artist while there and true indeed that
we traveled together in an old Ford station wagon to Rabat, and,
yes, his wife really was a New Yorker, a Quaker, a poet bearing a
superficial resemblance to Madame X. But all the rest is pure
fabrication.''  &LR;  Where do you get your ideas?
 &UR; ``My ideas? Well. Hmmmm. Which ideas would you be referring to?''  &LR; 
Where does your material originate? Your characters? The narrative
arc you employ?
</P>
<P>
   This is a question contemporary novelists are often asked, and
one they rightly suspect is a trap. Do you draw on real events,
real people, real situations?
</P>
<P>
   Hardly anyone is foolish enough to say yes, that novels are no
more than a surface reworking of a private experience. The
divorcing statement that introduces most fictions is both a legal
dodge and a self-assertion, reminding both the author and the
public of the role of imagination.
</P>
<P>
   There is the standard: ``This book is a work of fiction, and
therefore names, characters, places and incidents are products of
the author's imagination. Any resemblance to actual persons, events
or locales or persons, living or dead, is entirely coincidental.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, in a slyer, more ironic and perhaps more skeptical vein, we
have Davies' disclaimer prefacing The Salterlon Trilogy, ``Readers
who think that they can identify the creations of the author's
fancy among their own acquaintance are paying the author an
extravagant compliment, which he acknowledges with gratitude.''
</P>
<P>
   I've heard writers say that their friends wouldn't recognize
themselves if they apprehended their image in the pages of a novel.
Writerly paint would have blurred the outlines; writerly invention
would have added enough ornamentation to conceal the true identity.
</P>
<P>
   But readers are not so easily fooled as this, especially readers
who have collided with novelists or even befriended them. They know
they are in danger the minute they are admitted to a writer's life,
and they read the published text with a magnifying lens in hand.
</P>
<P>
   Could that be me, that fool dribbling coffee down his shirt
front and babbling about the tyranny of life in the suburbs, about
the betrayal of love? Yes, of course it's me.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   During the 20 or so years I taught classes in creative writing,
I never once encountered a student who didn't worry, at some level,
that a friend or family member was going to be violated, punished
or crucified in a piece of writing. (Mothers take an exceptionally
heavy rap with younger students.) This fear persisted even among
students whose work would stand scarcely any chance of ever being
published. The concern was real, and often it afflicted young
writers with classic writer's block before they'd written so much
as a single word.
</P>
<P>
   I always urged them to say what they had to say anyway,
unshackled by any thought of personal response. They could revise
afterward, I said, burying the real person by altering gender,
race, the time frame, the geographical context. The choices were
limitless. Write bravely, truly; revise with discretion, tact. This
is easy enough to say, but I have come to understand exactly how
difficult it is in the end to make the small and necessary
sacrifices once words are committed to paper. There are times when
changing even a name feels like a hideous compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The inability of fiction to stare at itself goes back to the
earliest novels of the 18th century and rises, I like to think,
from the twinning of embarrassment and innocence. How does a writer
confess that the printed offering is a tissue of imagination? The
whole force of moral imperative rages against such a whimsical
presentation: lying, inventing, daydreaming. In desperation early
fiction writers supplied their narratives with implicitly
understood framing devices like: This is a tale found in an old
trunk. This is a story related to me by an ancient gentleman. This
is a dream recorded by an angel.
</P>
<P>
   We love fiction because it possesses the texture of the real.
The characters in a novel resemble, more or less, ourselves.
Fiction's dilemmas are similar to those we encounter every day, and
there are novelists who do indeed write close to the
autobiographical bone. As for the others, if they don't draw on
their own experience, where on earth does it all come from?
</P>
<P>
   The imaginative side of fiction writing is always hard to
describe to nonwriters, those tunnels in the unconscious, those
flitting responses to what might have been, what possibly could be.
</P>
<P>
   There is a famous, perhaps whimsical story about the British
writer John Buchan, who wrote dozens of successful adventure
novels. At one point in his career he was determined to write a
novel about the Canadian Arctic. This was some time before he
arrived in Canada to serve as governor general, and he knew nothing
in the way of background information. Fortunately, though, his son
had just returned from spending a year there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell me 10 facts about the Arctic,'' the elder Buchan
demanded. The son began a list, but his father interrupted after
just three facts had been delivered: ``That's enough. That's
plenty. I can manage with that.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest he could, and did, invent.

 &HT;    UGA officials hope fatal accident will bring about change
 &HT;    By James Salzer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Brian Harbin had heard ``horror stories'' from
relatives about their experiences getting into fraternities, so
when he started school at the University of Georgia, he chose one
that wouldn't put him through extensive hazing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would you want to be a brother with someone who paddled
you or made you clean the toilets at 3 a.m.?'' asked Harbin, a
member of Sigma Phi Epsilon, a fraternity suspended during the
mid-1990s over a booze-guzzling hazing that sent a student to the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Talk with fraternity members at UGA and they're likely to
divulge little if anything about what they go through to earn their
stripes. Police and college officials say they only know about
hazing when something bad happens, like a student winds up in an
emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   Greek members say the university has been cracking down, and
there are strict rules and plenty of talk of a zero tolerance on
hazing.
</P>
<P>
   But the prank that wound up in the death of Alpha Tau Omega
member Benjamin Folsom Grantham III a week ago is a reminder that
while there is a line drawn by college officials and fraternity
leaders, it's impossible to know how often it's crossed on or off a
campus where thousands of students are part of the Greek system.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really don't see things unless something bad happens,''
said Chuck Horton, longtime chief of the UGA police. ``I hear
through the grapevine that people don't do things any more. It's
like speeding violations. We have speed limits all over, but it
doesn't stop people from speeding.''
</P>
<P>
   Cases brought before UGA officials or police during the past
decade include a myriad of accusations, including paddlings,
students forced to streak on campus and used as chauffeurs,
underage drinking, injuries caused by excess partying and brawls.
</P>
<P>
   In the past five years, 10 UGA fraternities and sororities have
been disciplined for hazing, alcohol or curfew abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn Smiley, executive director of the national Alpha Tau Omega
organization, has tried to make it clear that the ``road trip''
Grantham was involved in _ an old fraternity prank _ was not a
``chapter event.''
</P>
<P>
   School and ATO rules prohibit ``road tripping,'' where a student
is driven out to a location and left, either to find their way back
or be found by others.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about 18, 19, 20 year-old guys,'' he said.
``They're going to do stupid stuff ... it goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   Smiley said Grantham was a willing participant in the game, a
fact that does not prohibit school officials from sanctioning the
group for hazing.
</P>
<P>
   During a memorial service last week, Grantham was described as a
Star-Trek loving, Camel-smoking frat boy who, like most college
students, knew how to have a good time. Some members of other frats
said ATO's reputation for partying was no greater than that of
other Greek chapters. Others used the immortal phrase of American
frat lexicon: Animal House. Still others called such
characterizations an exaggeration.
</P>
<P>
   During the ceremony, there was an air of deep reflection,
although members also said they planned to go out and party
afterward in memory of Grantham.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me and a lot of the brothers, it's been a real life-check
moment, realizing it can all end that quick,'' said Bo Pihl, the
chapter's vice president. ``For most of us, this is the first time
we've had to deal with losing someone.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of soul-searching UGA Greek Life officials hope
has come from the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``All our groups need to reflect on how they treat each other,''
said Eric Atkinson, fraternity adviser in UGA's Greek Life office.
``This should be a message to all of our chapters.''
</P>
<P>
   Members agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a gut-check for the whole fraternity system,'' said Mike
McAuliffe, a member of UGA's Beta Theta Pi fraternity.
</P>
<P>
   Beta Theta Pi has a ``dry,'' or no-alcohol rush and has been
successful in raising money for groups like the American Cancer
Society. McAuliffe's mother, Ceci, was proud that her son knew
where to draw his personal line of behavior and what he wanted out
of a fraternity.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of pledge pranks, she said, he took part in chapter
projects. ``I would rather have Mike refinish the floor (of his
frat house) than be taken up to South Carolina and forced to find
his way back,'' she said. ``It's a great bunch of kids who I'm
thrilled my son is involved with.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike McAuliffe said a few of his friends pledged with
fraternities because they had great parties, but now they wished
they hadn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a connection to my fraternity that doesn't have
anything to do with alcohol or girls,'' he said. ``With us, it's
not an attitude that we're out to get the pledges.''
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe said he checked out other fraternities, and that
hazing goes on.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that there was a line he simply wouldn't cross in
pledging.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a self-respect line,'' he said. ``There were times I
was thinking, `I don't need this.' I was going to do things I'm
comfortable with that would build brotherhood but not be
entertainment for the brothers. ``
</P>
<P>
   Clint Powell, vice president of the chapter, said, ``I hope all
this stuff that has been going down will serve as a wake-up call.''
</P>
<P>
   Hazing has been around on campuses across the country for
decades, and not just at fraternities and sororities. Horton
remembers athletes being hazed in the early 1970s, when he played
football at UGA. Rituals that would be considered hazing in college
have been part of pro sports as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not of concern to the national organizations and
university people 20 years ago. People weren't dying,'' said Bill
Bracewell, former longtime director of student judicial programs at
UGA.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-hazing and party rules for fraternities and sororities are
stricter than in the past, and Greek leaders are reenforcing them
with new, self-policing guidelines set to take effect this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that schools keep a closer eye on fraternities may mean
there are fewer problems and less hazing. Or it may mean activity
that still occurs has been driven behind closed doors or off
campus.
</P>
<P>
   The school's hazing policy outlaws forcing students to drink or
eat anything or to do calisthenics, tying them up and throwing food
or something else at them, paddling, ``road trips,'' inhibiting
sleep or making them run personal errands.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials say few of the problems they've seen over the
years have involved sororities. And most of the time problems arise
at frats, Atkinson said, alcohol is involved. That, in turns, adds
to the stereotype people have of Greek life as one big party.
</P>
<P>
   Greek organizations, many of which do extensive charity work,
say that's a mischaracterization brought on by the fact that the
media tends to focus only when things go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do like to have a good time, but what college student
doesn't like to have a good time?'' said Derick Corbett, who is a
member of Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity.
</P>
<P>
   UGA's social events registration form points to strict
standards. At parties, everyone is responsible for bringing their
own alcoholic beverages, the amount is limited, and beer kegs
aren't allowed. The total number of people at parties is limited
and all unlocked entrances and exits to party areas must be
monitored by a security guard or chapter member. Advertising is
prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   Some fraternity members also say the UGA Greek Life office sends
people to events to make sure there is no underage drinking.
``You'd be amazed how long the arm of Greek Life is,'' Harbin said.
``The days of Animal House are definitely over.''
</P>
<P>
   Atkinson said, ``It's not spying, it's just trying to make sure
we have chapters enforcing their own rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Such rules have probably led to less action at Greek houses, and
more at the dozens of bars in and around the campus area, according
to some UGA officials. The school also has year-around education
programs for Greek members on subjects like hazing, alcohol and
gambling, and has a hazing hotline.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jay Kimbro, a Sigma Chi member and president of UGA's
Interfraternity Council, said members have to police their
chapters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must hold ourselves to a higher standard,'' he said. ``As
fraternity men, we need to act like mature adults and hold each
other accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   If not, some are worried more fraternities will be shut down, or
UGA President Michael Adams will create a ``Greek park'' to
concentrate house chapters in one area of campus. Such a park was
created at Centre College in Kentucky, where Adams was previously
president.
</P>
<P>
   While that issue was discussed during a forum last year on
campus, Adams indicated at the time that such a proposal is a long
way from becoming reality.
</P>
<P>
   Some schools have outlawed Greeks on campus, and members realize
how they react to the latest incident is important to the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the future, people will start wising up and realizing there
is only one way to stay a Greek system,'' McAuliffe said.

`THE DEVIL AND SONNY LISTON': HAZY START, DARK END, CHAMPION IN
BETWEEN
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Near the start of his unusual biography, ``The Devil and Sonny
Liston,'' Nick Tosches writes: ``A guy who knew Sonny once said, `I
think he died the day he was born.' Nobody, not even Sonny, knew
exactly when that day was, or where he was born. Only he and the
men who killed him knew the date of his death. His life began and
ended in a blur.''
</P>
<P>
   That's right: ``the men who killed him,'' Tosches writes. Which
means he's going to clear up the old mystery behind the death in
January 1971 of the 39-year-old former heavyweight boxing champion,
whose body was found in the bedroom of his Las Vegas house with
drug paraphernalia lying nearby. So Liston didn't die of a
self-administered overdose, as was rumored at the time? The
prospect of answering this question is reason enough to read
Tosches' biography.
</P>
<P>
   But there are several other reasons. For one thing, Tosches
offers persuasive answers to another big mystery about Liston's
life: whether he threw not one but both of his championship bouts
against Muhammad Ali (who was known as Cassius Marcellus Clay until
their first fight on Feb. 25, 1964), and if so, why.
</P>
<P>
   Tosches has little but disdain for Clay, both as a fighter
compared to Liston and as ``the darling of a more elite mediocrity,
a white intelligentsia who sought meaning and metaphor in boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere he writes: ``Mediocrity and media, it should be
remembered, are cognates of the same Latin root. ... Clay should be
regarded as the first made-for-TV boxing idol. As he danced and
cavorted in acceptable and inoffensive outrageousness before the
masses and the cameras and the microphones of mediocrity, so
mediocrity embraced him.''
</P>
<P>
   Tosches makes a cogent case that the young Clay could not have
stood up to the real Liston. He cites among other evidence the
words of Chuck Wepner, who fought them both: ``Ali didn't hit like
Liston. Liston was the only man that ever hurt me.''
</P>
<P>
   So why, in the first fight, were Liston's blows ``delivered with
none of the awesome power that in the past had felled man after
man''? Why, in the rematch at Lewiston, Maine, in May 1965, was
Liston knocked out in the first round by a punch too short to do
serious damage, prompting the sports columnist Red Smith to write
that Liston took a dive that raised the level of the Androscoggin
River by a foot?
</P>
<P>
   Tosches rejects the theory that Liston and his people owned a
piece of Ali's future, or that Liston was intimidated by the Black
Muslims, who had recently won over Ali. He argues instead that
mobsters _ specifically Paul John (Frank) Carbo and Frank (Blinky)
Palermo _ owned Liston glove, shoe and trunks and had done so
practically from the instant he had turned professional.
</P>
<P>
   But they were tired of him, Tosches suggests. ``Sonny as a
champion was bad, bad news,'' he writes. He was unpopular. He
drank. He persistently got in trouble with the law. He was on the
verge of being revealed as a rapist. So they told him to pack it
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did what they told me to do,'' Liston told his eldest
brother, according to Tosches' account. And the people who ran
Liston ``went for the money,'' Tosches says. He writes that a
former chairman of the Nevada State Boxing Commission said of the
first Ali fight: ``They got $300,000 for the fight, and they bet it
seven-to-one. They got $2.1 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Tosches is an exhaustive reporter. He seems to have dug up
everyone ever connected to Liston and got them to talk,
particularly about the network of mob connections.
</P>
<P>
   He also can write vividly when moved, as when he recalls his
boyhood fascination with Liston: ``He was the ultimate outlaw. Man,
those narrow-lapeled sharkskin suits, that felling left and that
slaughterhouse right, and that scowl: his badness transcended
race.'' Any reader who wants more of Tosches' writing can get it in
a newly available volume, ``The Nick Tosches Reader'' (Da Capo
Press), an anthology of his occasional prose and excerpts from his
previous books, including ``Dino,'' his much-praised biography of
Dean Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ultimately ``The Devil and Sonny Liston'' fails to bring its
subject to life. The book may contain a sampling of Liston's famous
so-called mother-wit, like, ``The only thing my old man gave me was
a beating'' (omitting one of my favorites, uttered before his bout
with the German heavyweight Albert Westphal: ``Westphal, Eastphal,
that boy's gonna fall''). But there remains an odd dissonance
between this Liston and the one Tosches tries to animate with his
complex, heavy-breathing metaphors:
</P>
<P>
   `` `I ain't complaining,' he would say, later in 1960. He spoke
as one who knew in his blood what few others admitted: that no man
. . . was ever his own man. ... That, and that alone, was nature;
and to be aware of this, in thought and in blood, or in blood
alone, was to possess something of wisdom, and therein lay the only
manumission, the only, elusive windblown cornsilk strand of freedom
that was real amid the illusive and delusive freedom that all
professed and praised.
</P>
<P>
   ```They treat me good,' he would say.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end ``The Devil and Sonny Liston'' turns out to be a bit
of a tease as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he took too much dope and died,'' Tosches concludes
his analysis of all the murder theories surrounding Liston's death.
``I look back to a sentence that I wrote over a year ago, a
sentence that appears in the earliest of these pages:  &UR; Only he and
the men who killed him knew the date of his death. &LR;  Looking at it,
I realize that it can be easily and cleanly deleted, plucked from
the page, with no effect on the words or meaning that surround it.
But I choose to leave it there, because it expressed my feeling at
that time, and because, unlike a statement proven untrue, it very
well might express not only my past feelings, but also the truth,
which, in this matter, will never be known.''
</P>
<P>
   There may be less here than meets the eye.

 &HT;    Hard knocks drive Ellis
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After Saturday's NFL draft, Shaun Ellis' mother
finally will get to walk away from the dough.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis, a defensive end from Tennessee, is projected to be among
the first 25 players drafted, which would make him an instant
millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   After he's drafted, Ellis says one of the first things he'll do
is ask his mother, Annie Ellis, to quit her job.
</P>
<P>
   Five days a week, Annie Ellis clocks in at 5 a.m. at a bakery in
Anderson, S.C. She stands for hours, despite suffering from
arthritis that he worries may eventually leave her crippled.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a hard-working lady and it's taken a toll on her body,''
Shaun Ellis said. ``It's time for her to give it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis, 6 feet 4 and 280 pounds, nearly watched his dream of
playing in the NFL vanish two years ago. On March 16, 1998, Ellis
was driving back to Knoxville from his mother's home.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 minutes outside of Knoxville, Ellis fell asleep at the
wheel of his Ford Taurus. The car hit a cement drain and then some
trees. The car flipped several times before it landed in an
embankment.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, Ellis was wearing a seat belt. A nurse on her way to
work witnessed the accident, stopped to help and called an
ambulance. A fractured hip kept Ellis out of spring practice.
</P>
<P>
   Miraculously, he returned to two-a-day practices that fall and
played in the first game of his junior season. He says his hip is
fine, and the only scars from the accident are on his lower lip,
which was nearly torn off.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what drives me today,'' Ellis said. ``Every time I
think things get hard, I just think about that time.''
</P>
<P>
   And he thinks about his mother and how he'll change her life.
That's why he decided to leave Tennessee one year early.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Ellis was academically ineligible as a freshman because
he was accepted to school as a partial qualifier. But because Ellis
had finished at least 75 percent of his degree in four years, he
was awarded an additional year of eligibility by the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   He won't need it.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Volunteers played Nebraska in the Fiesta Bowl on Jan.
2, Ellis decided to enter the NFL draft. He knew the decision would
help stop his mother's pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get tired of your mom having to struggle so hard to make a
living,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Ellis is hoping to make it hard on NFL offensive tackles.
He's widely regarded as the second-best defensive end in the draft,
behind Penn State's Courtney Brown, who could become the No. 1
pick.
</P>
<P>
   Despite playing with a pinched nerve in his neck last season,
Ellis was still chosen All-SEC. He had 42 tackles, 11 stops for
loss and 8 1/2 sacks in his final college season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I bring a powerful type of rushing to the game,'' he
said. ``I've got real quickness and not just in stopping the run. I
can rush from either side. I can put either hand down on the
ground, too. I can play every down. I can play against the run or
the pass.''

   ELIAN _ WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department ``would be
prepared'' to order Juan Miguel Gonzalez to remain in the United
States with his son Elian while courts determine custody rights,
Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder said Sunday. Also Sunday, the
father met with a government-appointed team of psychologists and
with Florida fishermen representing Elian's Miami relatives. The
relatives reportedly were preparing new court action Monday as an
expected midweek deadline to turn over the boy approached. (Lipman,

   PERU-FUJIMORI _ LIMA _ Peru's Alberto Fujimori hopes to claim a

forced into a runoff. (Cox News Service).

pay the total within the prescribed three-year period, so they

   MLK-GA-FLAG _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ While South Carolina is
still fighting an increasingly uncivil war over the Confederate
battle flag, this city has apparently made peace before controversy
could flare. Workmen were completing the Martin Luther King Jr.
Landmark Memorial Thursday afternoon when electrician John Padgett
happened to glance up at the 21 flags that had just been raised.
``I couldn't believe that for Martin Luther King they would have
that flag up there, with all that's going on now,'' Padgett said
Saturday. (Hayes, Palm Beach Post). MOVED.

   UGA-FRAT _ His relatives told him horror stories about what they
went through in college to get into fraternities, so UGA student
Brian Harbin of Atlanta chose one that wouldn't haze him. ``Why
would you want to be a brother with someone who paddled you or made
you clean the toilets at 3 a.m.?'' he asked. Talk with fraternity
members and they're likely to divulge little about what they go
through to earn their stripes as pledges, and police and college
officials only know about hazing when something bad happens, like a
student winds up in the hospital with alcohol poisoning. Despite
claims that they are cracking down, and assurances that they have
taken a zero tolerance on hazing, incidents like the prank that
wound up killing popular UGA frat boy Ben Grantham last month seem
to pop up a couple of times a year. (Salzer, Atlanta

   DRUGS-MORENO _ Linda Moreno went to see her doctor to lose

she's due in Atlanta Municipal Court on Thursday to face battery
charges stemming from a Buckhead bar incident. And she turns 26 on

   SENIOR-WORK _ WACO, Texas _ Before they step up to the counter
to order their chicken sandwiches and french fries, customers at
Chick-fil-A are greeted by Ethel Beard's warm smile and kind words.
``Hello, welcome to Chick-Fil-A. How are you today?'' she says as
restaurant patrons walk in the double glass doors. The 63-year-old

``Miss Ethel,'' has worked as the restaurant's hostess for almost

<P>
   Shots explode at a school in Oregon, a brokerage office in
Atlanta, or a church in Fort Worth, and the nation is witness to
another sudden, seemingly random violent rampage. Before the
ambulances leave, the news crews arrive. The killers' neighbors,
friends or families submit to interviews, and inevitably, they say
something like this: ``He just snapped.''
</P>
<P>
   But the killers do not just snap. An examination by The New York
Times of 100 rampage murders found that most of the killers
spiraled down a long slow slide, mentally and emotionally. Most of
them left a road map of red flags, spending months plotting their
attacks and accumulating weapons, talking openly of their plans for
bloodshed. Many showed signs of serious mental health problems.
</P>
<P>
   But in case after case, the Times review found, the warning
signs were missed: by a tattered mental health care system; by
families unable to face the evidence of serious mental turmoil in
their children or siblings; by employers, teachers and principals
who failed to take the threats seriously; by the police who, when
alerted to the danger by frightened relatives, neighbors or
friends, were incapable of intervening before the violence erupted.
</P>
<P>
   James Davis, whose co-workers had nicknamed him Psycho, warned
his colleagues at a tool warehouse in Asheville, N.C., ``If they
ever decide to fire me, I'll take two or three of them with me.''
His employers did fire him, and feared he would respond with
violence, but despite his threats, they failed to protect his
co-workers when Davis returned to take his revenge.
</P>
<P>
   In 34 of the 100 cases, however, families or friends of the
killers desperately did try to find help for a person they feared
was a ticking time bomb, but were rebuffed by police, school
administrators or mental health workers.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Seegrist caromed in and out of mental institutions 12
times in 10 years, while her parents searched for a residential
program where she could stay in treatment. They knew she was
dangerous. She had stabbed a psychologist, tried to strangle her
mother, and had hidden a gun in her apartment. But each time, she
was released from the hospital when she seemed to improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were always fearful that maybe some tragedy would happen,''
said Ruth S. Seegrist, Sylvia's mother. ``She threatened it:
`Someday before I kill myself, I'll bring some people down with
me.''' Sylvia opened fire in a suburban Philadelphia shopping mall
in 1985, killing three people and wounding seven.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the recent spate of rampage-style mass shootings
in schools, workplaces, stores and other public places, The New
York Times re-examined 100 such violent incidents that occurred in
the United States over the last 50 years. The Times gathered
extensive information on all 100, and looked closely at more than
25 of the cases, a surprising number of which attracted little but
local attention.
</P>
<P>
   The examination included reviews of court cases, news coverage
and mental health records, and interviews with families and
friends, psychologists and victims, in an effort to glean what the
people closest to each tragedy had learned. In some cases,
reporters questioned the killers themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Based on this information, The Times found that in 63 of the 100
cases (which involve 102 killers), the killers made general threats
of violence to others in advance. Fifty-five of the 100 cases
involved killers who regularly expressed explosive anger or
frustration, and 35 killers had a history of violent behavior and
assaults. They were so noticeably unstable that even in their very
separate circles they had been awarded similar nicknames: ``Crazy
Pat,'' ``Crazy John,'' ``Crazy Joe.''
</P>
<P>
   And in 40 cases, family members and others said they noticed
sudden changes in behavior in the period before the rampage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you find out about each of these cases, the more it
makes sense,'' said Dewey G. Cornell, a clinical psychologist at
the University of Virginia and director of the Virginia Youth
Violence Project, which studies school safety and violence
prevention. ``This notion that someone just snaps is based on
ignorance and denial,'' Cornell said. ``People don't just snap.
Pressures build up.''
</P>
<P>
   Many psychologists caution that it is impossible to predict
violent behavior, and that most people who threaten violence never
follow through. Often, it is only in retrospect that each killer's
life appears to be a coherent chilling narrative foretelling
obvious danger. Looking back, it is easy to marvel that people who
knew the murderer could have failed to see it coming? In
particular, how could so many psychiatric workers, and even police,
have missed the warning signs?
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, there was no single person in the potential
killer's life to put together the lethal clues. Colleagues,
friends, family members, mental health professionals, teachers and
the police may have independently sensed something disturbing, but
they did not communicate with one another. Frightened neighbors or
co-workers decided it was safest to keep their distance. Friends
laughed off homicidal talk. Parents did not know where to turn, or
just hoped the irrational fury was merely a phase.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like looking at the night sky,'' said Dr. Robert
Granacher Jr., a psychiatrist in Lexington, Ky., who has examined
the records of several rampage murderers. ``If you only see one or
two stars, you may not see the whole constellation. It's the same
with these fragmentary bits of information; no one has the whole
picture.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the review of these cases suggests that if people
understood more about mental illness and connected the clues, many
of these rampage killings could be prevented.

A KNACK FOR GENERATING CONTROVERSY WORRIES ABC NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JIM RUTENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One day last week, an ABC crew in Miami invested in a crane
across the street from the great uncle of Elian Gonzalez, a classic
maneuver intended to guarantee clear shots of the child if the
authorities sealed the perimeter of the house. It looked as if ABC
would have a lead on the competition.
</P>
<P>
   But an ABC news executive ordered the crew to forget the crane.
Why risk needless criticism about prying cameras when the perimeter
had not yet been sealed?
</P>
<P>
   In the scheme of things, it was probably a good idea. The last
thing that ABC News needed was another controversy.
</P>
<P>
   For the last three weeks, events behind the scene at ABC News
have seemed almost as compelling as the news itself. In the
process, internal differences have been exposed and the president
of ABC News, David Westin, has faced uncomfortable questions about
his grip on the division and his mandate to take bold strokes to
break through the cluttered marketplace of news.
</P>
<P>
   First, a staff rebellion quashed a move to make Mark Fuhrman,
the detective accused of racism in the O.J. Simpson case, a paid
consultant for ``Good Morning America'' on a murder story.
</P>
<P>
   Then, critics assailed the division for broadcasting an
interview with the 6-year-old Gonzalez boy, which they said
violated a general rule not to put young children under such a
spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Then, news broke that the division had employed the actor and
teen-age idol Leonardo DiCaprio to interview President Clinton for
a prime-time special program on global warming _ a move that has
been variously described as a new low in celebrity journalism or an
inventive move to attract young viewers to news programs.
</P>
<P>
   Now Westin will decide whether to scrap the DiCaprio interview
and how prominently the star should be featured in the special,
scheduled for some time next week. The raw footage, which was being
edited by producers over the weekend, was said by the White House
to include DiCaprio asking Clinton about the Kyoto environmental
accord.
</P>
<P>
   In another segment, others say, DiCaprio, who has been
designated chairman of the Earth Day 2000 celebration, was taped
sitting on a rock by a pond he used to visit as a boy, discussing
the depletion of the frog population there. The production is said
to all have an MTV feel, and it features short segments about
global warming and related environmental issues photographed from
Alaska to Atlanta. As it stood this weekend, both DiCaprio and the
correspondent Chris Cuomo introduce the segments, basically as
co-hosts.
</P>
<P>
   Seldom has the editing process been so closely watched. Whatever
he decides, Westin will send a signal about what he thinks is
appropriate, as the pressure to rise above other media outlets _ to
be distinctive _ becomes ever greater.
</P>
<P>
   That pressure, Westin acknowledges, is prompting him to
encourage his producers to try new techniques to hold their
audience, if not expand it, and make it younger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in a first-rate news division of any sort, one has to
be moving forward,'' Westin said last week in a telephone
interview. ``We can't keep programming news programs just the way
we did five or 10 years ago. Society has changed around us; our
competition has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Westin said he wants his producers to devise programming that
will stand out. But, he quickly added, standard journalistic lines
should not be crossed.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a clear understanding at ABC News of exactly what
Westin means? Not consistently, executives acknowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Westin was faced with demands for explanations about the
DiCaprio affair from Sam Donaldson, Peter Jennings and Ted Koppel,
who are said to be uncomfortable with Westin's edict to try new
things, though understanding of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it's a changed business, and we ought to recognize
that,'' Donaldson said last week. ``But we also all have to
recognize that we have to do things according to the standards that
will help us retain our credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Bednar, executive producer of the special, said it is
causing too much fuss. ``It was truth in advertising from the
get-go with Leo's opening line to the president that he's not a
journalist,'' Maine Bednar said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the criticism, both in the organization and outside, has
been unfair. ``It's like the Moral Majority condemning a film, and
you ask them, `Have you seen it?' and they say `no,''' Bednar
remarked.
</P>
<P>
   ABC News has never walked in lock-step. There have always been
fiefs _ of stars and of individual programs. And there have long
been two schools of thought about the mixture of news and
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   But ordering change and managing the various forces is a tall
order, especially for Westin, 47, a corporate lawyer and a relative
newcomer to journalism who has had to fill the shoes of his
predecessor, Roone Arledge. The inexperience has, at times, put him
at a handicap in the news division, and in recent weeks, allies
have been placed in the embarrassing position of portraying him as
the victim of events.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-March, some staff members nearly rebelled when it was
disclosed that Fuhrman had been hired by Shelley Ross, the
executive producer of ``Good Morning America'' as a paid consultant
to win his exclusive insight into the killing in 1975 of Martha
Moxley, a Greenwich, Conn., teen-ager. Some credit Fuhrman with
helping to successfully reopen the investigation into Michael
Skakel, the Kennedy cousin now charged in her death.
</P>
<P>
   A news staff member found out about the hiring of Fuhrman after
seeing a guest list. A furor followed, the deal was called off, and
it was agreed that he would not be paid for appearances.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, Diane Sawyer interviewed Elian Gonzalez for ``Good
Morning America'' and ``20/20'' in the days leading up to the
justice department's decision to send him home to Cuba with his
father. According to ABC News executives' accounts, they did not
want Sawyer to ask or place emphasis on whether the boy wanted to
go back to Cuba. An ABC spokeswoman, Eileen Murphy, insisted that
news executives requested only that Elian's desires not be made a
focal point.
</P>
<P>
   When the segment was broadcast, Sawyer told her audience that
the boy said he wanted to return, but she said that she would not
show him saying it because of the sensitive nature of the case.
</P>
<P>
   The report was deplored by media critics. Some executives say
that if the question about returning to Cuba had not come up,
Westin would not have taken so much heat.
</P>
<P>
   In the matter of DiCaprio, executives said Westin had been
misled, though not maliciously.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After the DiCaprio interview was disclosed in The Washington
Post, Westin sent an e-mail message to staff members saying that no
interview had been planned and that DiCaprio was supposed to do a
walk-through at the White House and discuss only the White House's
own environmental practices, like how it recycles its trash. He
said President Clinton might appear during the tour.
</P>
<P>
   The White House called this version of events ``rife with
inaccuracies,'' and it was disclosed that DiCaprio did in fact draw
up his questions in advance, with some assistance from ABC News
producers. This all begged the question of what is the difference
between an interview that is conducted while walking or sitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``ABC doesn't know whether Leo and I had an interview, a
walk-through or a drive-by,'' Clinton joked at the annual Radio and
Television Correspondents' Association dinner on Thursday. ``Don't
you news people ever learn? It isn't the mistake that kills you.
It's the cover-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Friedman, executive vice president of ABC News, said that
at the time Westin wrote the e-mail message, he did believe what he
was asserting. He added that Westin had been given ``incomplete''
information by his own producers, who allowed DiCaprio to ask the
president why global warming did not get the same attention as
deficiencies in health care.
</P>
<P>
   And Westin said on Friday, ``It is clear to me now that ABC news
people worked with Leonardo DiCaprio to prepare him to ask some
questions that go beyond what I would have put on the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman said DiCaprio's White House visit ``started out with
all the best intentions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some mistakes were made,'' he said. ``David was victimized by
those mistakes and by incomplete information given to him after the
fact.''
</P>
<P>
   The program's executive producer, Bednar, said it had not been
his intention to mislead Westin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the communicators here miscommunicating,'' he said,
adding that in hindsight, he thought he could have been more
emphatic in telling Westin that an interview about general
environmental matters had always been planned and that specific
questions were prepared for DiCaprio.
</P>
<P>
   Westin knows that criticisms of his leadership are being made
and, considering the last three weeks, he said some of that is
valid. That is why, he said, he recently reorganized his division
and named Friedman, who has 18 years in the division and the
respect of the old guard, as his executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   With that done, Westin and his top executives said they intend
to keep pushing for change, even though it might mean ruffling some
feathers.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: Network newscasts generally draw an older audience _
people in their 40s, 50s and 60s. Younger viewers are not drawn to
newscasts. The decision to produce the DiCaprio special was to
bring these viewers into the ABC fold, Westin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't add a younger audience, sooner or later our
audience will die,'' Westin said.
</P>
<P>
   The tough part is: Can he keep ABC's news practices out of the
news, too?

BRITISH AIRWAYS IN CORPORATE TRAVEL VENTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ British Airways and the online business-travel service
GetThere.com plan to announce Monday that they will create
customized Web sites to provide corporate travel agency services
for small and mid-sized business in Britain and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The new sites will be based on GetThere's Global Manager, an
electronic travel service used by large corporations like Nike and
Cisco Systems to book business trips for employees. British Airways
will enable small and mid-size business users to book air, car and
hotel reservations with the same management and reporting tools
that large corporations use. While companies will be able to book
flights on other airlines, British Airways will be the default
choice. A small business, for example, could identify certain
employees who would be allowed to book business-class fares and
designate other employees as eligible only for coach-class fares.
The employer might also create guidelines governing the kind of
accommodations various types of employees are allowed to book. The
system would allow employees to identify preferred airlines or
hotels with which the company has negotiated discounts.
</P>
<P>
   Companies will be able to create their own customized sites
within the portal.
</P>
<P>
   The new site is part of British Airways' push into electronic
commerce, particularly into the vaunted business-to-business
portion of that market. The new site also fits with the airline's
shift, after recent losses, toward attracting more customers
willing to pay business-class fares, which have a significantly
higher profit margin than coach seats.
</P>
<P>
   Simon Parks Smith, manager of British Airways'
business-to-business ventures, said the new is site was ``an
opportunity for us to use e-commerce'' to reach small and mid-size
European businesses.
</P>
<P>
   For GetThere, based in Menlo Park, Calif., the link-up with
British Airways gives the young company considerable marketing

   GetThere has been eyeing the European market for some time. It
opened a London office here recently and is adding new features to
its site to offer European customers services like booking
reservations on trains and ferries.

   Whether GetThere will ever put American Express' corporate
travel service out of business remains questionable _ or perhaps
the wrong question. The company's clients include American Express,
which uses the GetThere service for some of its own clients.

CHASE SET TO ACQUIRE BRITISH BANK FOR $8 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Robert Fleming Holdings, one of Britain's last
independent banks, is expected to announce as soon as Tuesday that
it will be acquired by the Chase Manhattan Corp. for close to 5
billion pounds, or nearly $8 billion, executives close to the talks
said.
</P>
<P>
   The price is higher than most analysts expected when reports of
the negotiations emerged last month.
</P>
<P>
   While the details of the deal have not been completed, the
executives said, they were confident the acquisition would go
through. Executives from both banks have been working out the
particulars since the banks acknowledged on March 22 that they were
in negotiations. The new company would be called Chase Fleming in
Europe, the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Several executives close to the talks acknowledged that one of
the main reasons for confirming the discussions last month was to
``prime the market'' so that when the deal was finally announced,
the deal and price would not surprise analysts and market makers.
</P>
<P>
   That strategy may have backfired because initial speculation
about the price for Fleming focused on a considerably lower figure
of 3 billion pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that it was too early to say whether Chase was
paying a fair price, but one analyst who spoke on the condition of
anonymity said, ``Five billion pounds sounds a bit outrageous to
me. Are we talking about the same Fleming?''
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to the talks also said that the deal would not
include Fleming's 50 percent stake in the $35-billion Rowe
Price-Fleming International Inc., a fund management joint venture.
The executives said Price Fleming plans to sell the stake to T.
Rowe Price Associates Inc., its partner in the venture.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition is part of Chase's strategy to bolster its
business in Europe and Asia. The deal follows Chase's $1.35-billion
acquisition of the Hambrecht &AMP; Quist Group last year, which helped
strengthen Chase's high-technology investment banking business. &QL;

 &HT;    Lawsuit alleges illegal and unethical practices by drug company
 &HT;    By Sanjay Bhatt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ Linda Moreno went to see her doctor to
lose weight four years ago. Today, her lawyers expect her to die
soon from what they claim are the side effects of the once popular
drug combination fen-phen.
</P>
<P>
   Her lawsuit against the makers and sellers of the ``fen'' in
fen-phen alleges they engaged in illegal and unethical marketing
practices. If those claims are proved in court, it could raise a
troubling question: How far is a drug company willing to go for a
profit?
</P>
<P>
   The maker of the weight-loss drugs Pondimin (fenfluramine) and
Redux (dexfenfluramine) withdrew them from the U.S. market in
September 1997 after the federal Food and Drug Administration
received more than two dozen reports of patients with heart-valve
damage.
</P>
<P>
   Moreno's suit, filed in 1997, alleges that the maker of Pondimin
and its chemical cousin, Redux, fraudulently withheld information
about the drugs' adverse side effects from the FDA, doctors, the
public and even the drug companies' own sales representatives, all
in the name of profits.
</P>
<P>
   Defendant American Home Products and its subsidiaries, including
Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, deny the allegations with 52 legal
theories _ among them, that it provided adequate warnings to
Moreno's physicians, followed all laws and is not liable for
conduct protected by the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Internal company documents subpoenaed in the lawsuit show top
executives at Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, which had the rights to
sell the drugs in the U.S., discussed plans to stir up buzz on
Redux with articles on treating obesity in prominent medical
journals and with a weekend trip to Scottsdale, Ariz., for about
100 doctors. The lawsuit calls the articles ``unethical sleaze on
the part of a pharmaceutical company.''
</P>
<P>
   The documents also show the sales force at A.H. Robins,
Wyeth-Ayerst's sister company, was given information on clinical
studies done by Michael Weintraub, a University of Rochester
physician who concluded combining Pondimin with phentermine was
safe and effective in helping patients lose weight. Such
``off-label'' use of Pondimin _ the FDA had not approved combining
the drug this way _ became wildly popular after Weintraub's
findings were published in 1992. Sales reps were instructed not to
encourage doctors to use the drug combination. But they were also
told to give doctors the studies' citations if they were
interested.
</P>
<P>
   SUIT CLAIMS MISREPRESENTATION
</P>
<P>
   The suit claims the company failed to correct inaccurate
statements by news media about Pondimin and Redux and
misrepresented the true risk of its drugs in news releases and its
product labels.
</P>
<P>
   As Pondimin sales zoomed to $49 million in 1995 from $8.5
million the previous year, fueled by fen-phen doctors, Wyeth-Ayerst
executives feared that generic drugmakers would move in on their
market dominance, company documents in the court file state.
</P>
<P>
   Redux, which was in the final stages of FDA clearance, would
give the company a patented, more profitable weight-loss drug to
replace Pondimin, which no longer had patent protection and could
be copied by generic drug makers who could sell it for a lot less,
thereby cutting into Pondimin's sales.
</P>
<P>
   The company's Redux sales would be hurt if the drug's label had
a black box warning for primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH), a
fatal heart-lung disorder, or if the company had to state an
incident rate of 1 in 45,000 instead of 5 per million, a company
marketing executive wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you know, this is probably the biggest single factor
remaining to determine future sales performance of the product,''
her memo said. The FDA later allowed the drug to be sold without
the warning box.
</P>
<P>
   By March 1996, the company's sales force was making final
preparations to blitz doctors and the public with an aggressive
marketing campaign upon Redux's approval, which occurred a month
later.
</P>
<P>
   CONVENTION INCREASED SALES
</P>
<P>
   Conventions would be a key: James Donovan, executive director of
marketing, noted a study that found physicians who visited product
exhibits increased their prescription-writing for those products by
18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``A large consultant's conference on obesity involving almost
100 obesity experts will be held in Scottsdale, Arizona April
19-21,'' according to a marketing memo. ``This educational meeting
will also help develop product advocates who will be provided with
patient starter supplies to generate early post-approval clinical
experience. These experts will also provide for local and regional
media needs.''
</P>
<P>
   The company had a list of 51 speakers on obesity treatments, of
whom 41 received money from the company or its subsidiaries for
clinical studies, according to the documents.
</P>
<P>
   A 1995 memo in the court files from one Wyeth-Ayerst executive
to another points out that Europe was expected to restrict the use
of mixtures like fen-phen for fear of causing the fatal heart-lung
disorder PPH _ the same disorder Moreno's lawyers say she suffers
from.
</P>
<P>
   Wyeth-Ayerst's Arizona conference was held in 1996, a year
later. But in the company's workbook for conference participants,
its clinical investigator said the rate of PPH in obese patients
was only ``about 23 to 46 per million.''
</P>
<P>
   But later the same year, according to the court file, the
chairman of an international study group that examined Pondimin,
Redux and other appetite suppressants wrote the company to complain
that its press releases about Redux were inaccurate. The real
chances of contracting PPH were much higher, he claimed. His group
had estimated the chance of PPH in obese patients who used the drug
over a long period of time to be about 100 per million.
</P>
<P>
   ARTICLES INTENDED TO TARGET WIDER AUDIENCE
</P>
<P>
   In December 1996, months after Redux was cleared for sale by the
FDA, Excerpta Medica, a subsidiary of a major medical journal
publisher, billed Wyeth-Ayerst $200,000 for 10 papers, according to
court documents. The fee ``reflects the developmental costs of
researching, writing, editing and revising the paper, the author's
honorarium ($1,500), and the management fee,'' according to the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   The articles, reviewed by Wyeth-Ayerst, were to appear in
journals targeting primary care physicians, osteopathic physicians,
gynecologists, cardiologists, nurse practitioners, physician
assistants, pharmacists and managed care administrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wyeth-Ayerst should consider broader targeting as opposed to
the highly targeted, high prescriber focus at introduction that has
become the industry standard,'' explained a February 1996 memo to
marketing executives.
</P>
<P>
   High prescribers, it turns out, were happy with fen-phen and
skeptical of giving patients a single pill of the new,
patent-protected Redux because its chemical cousin Pondimin didn't
work on its own, the memo said.
</P>
<P>
   For primary care physicians, Excerpta Medica suggested a paper
whose objective was ``to provide the reader with an update on the
dexfenfluramine experience.'' The author had not been determined,
but the article would appear in the American Journal of Medicine, a
journal published by Excerpta's parent company, Reed Elsevier.
</P>
<P>
   The American Journal article on treating obesity said that
fenfluramine (Pondimin was the leading brand name) was the ``only
available appetite suppressant in the United States,'' and didn't
disclose anywhere that Wyeth-Ayerst had reviewed the article or
paid for it, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY AND ETHICS QUESTIONED
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Moreno complained that the article ``was
commissioned, paid for, drafted by a company paid by AHP (American
Home Products), and published in a journal owned by the same
company!''
</P>
<P>
   The truth has been taken out of context and twisted, said Jean
Dolan, Excerpta Medica's executive vice president. The author
controlled the paper's content, not the drug company, and the
peer-reviewed journal's publisher didn't even know Excerpta Medica
had helped the author with searching the medical literature, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no collusion involved, and nothing unethical was
done,'' Dolan said. ``We try to get well-respected authorities in
the field. These people aren't going to compromise their reputation
for $1,500. I find that idea offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Wyeth-Ayerst's market research also showed most high prescribers
were primary care physicians in solo practice without any
dieticians or physician assistants on staff.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Daisey Merey, a board-certified bariatrician, or weight-loss
specialist, said too many consumers and doctors relied on the pills
without paying attention to diet, exercise and mental health. She
misses having Pondimin and Redux in her arsenal for treating obese
patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of physicians who were not bariatricians were using the
drug (combination) hoping it would do everything,'' Merey said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreno's trial could hinge on whether, and if so, why the
defendants delayed for more than a year changing Pondimin's label
to reflect the higher number of users developing primary pulmonary
hypertension or dying. The court file includes an internal memo in
1994 warning that the number of incidents was higher than mentioned
on the label.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know, other doctors didn't know, nobody knew,'' Merey
said.
</P>
<P>
   She recalls going to a dinner meeting on Redux put on by
Interneuron Pharmaceuticals Inc., which held the drug's U.S.
license and partnered with American Home Products to market the
drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``A dinner is not a big incentive,'' Merey said. ``Continuing
education is very important for physicians. ... That's where we
gain our expertise.''

   OXFORD, England _ In its familiar version, the Oxford English
Dictionary stretches over 20 volumes, weighs 138 pounds and so
thoroughly plumbs the history of 640,000 words and phrases that
there would seem to be nothing left to plumb. Shakespeare, its most
quoted author, is cited 33,000 times. There are 20 pages devoted to
the verb ``to set.''
</P>
<P>
   That's nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier last month the mild-mannered dictionary ducked into a
phone booth, put on some high-tech tights and a cape, and emerged
as the Superman of reference works. Its new electronic version does
not fit on any shelf, but it is the first phase of a $55 million,
10-year overhaul that will add more than 600,000 new words _ and
revise the 19th-century entries for many old ones.
</P>
<P>
   The new dictionary isn't cheap. Annual subscriptions cost $795
and higher for institutions and $550 for individuals. But its
editors hope that the format will enable the OED, as the work is
generally known, to reach far more people than it does already,
with most of the users logging on through libraries and
universities (Web site: www.oed.com).
</P>
<P>
   It is hard not to conclude that the electronic format is the
only one expansive enough to allow for the explosion of new English
words and expressions in a language hard-pressed to keep up with
its evolution. Already the format has revolutionized the way
readers can search for words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, if you've got a print dictionary you're limited in
the way you can look through it: You can either look up something
by the head word, or you can browse serendipitously, opening the
book at random for guidance,'' said John Simpson, the dictionary's
chief editor.
</P>
<P>
   But online, he said, you can summon and compare all the
citations that quote Milton, or Mark Twain, or the musician Brian
Eno (Eno is cited for his representative use of the word ambient).
You can ask for a snapshot of the English language in 1492, when
Columbus was still sailing the ocean blue and American English,
frisky and rambunctious as a precocious child, was as yet unborn.
</P>
<P>
   And if _ for reasons known to yourself _ you would like a list
of all the English words that take in every vowel (plus y) in order
(``abstemiously,'' for one), there is nothing to stop you from
getting one.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed recently in the dictionary's vast, cubicled offices,
Simpson, 46, did not seem like someone riding the crest of a
technological and lexicographical revolution, although his desk had
two computers on it and not much paper. He has worked for the OED
since 1976, but the years have not dimmed his enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   He does not play favorites among words. ``There's usually
something interesting you can say about any word,'' he said.
``You're dealing with the whole history of a word, not just its
definition, but the word in the social context in which it
appears.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot has happened to society and the context for language since
1879, when professor James Murray took control of an awesomely
ambitious (and awesomely unrealized, at that point) project to
create an all-inclusive historical tour of the English language. In
Murray's vision, words were followed by their myriad definitions,
etymological roots and quotations illustrating shades of meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Murray had a long gray beard that gave him the appearance of a
Slavic mystic. He also had a single-minded devotion to the cause,
which was helpful because it took 44 more years to complete.
</P>
<P>
   He died at the letter T, though, in 1915. When the last volume
was published 13 years later, it was already on its way to
obsolescence. Among other things, the complicated nature of the
undertaking meant that once a volume was printed, it was impossible
to correct early omissions and errors.
</P>
<P>
   The word African was left out, for instance, a decision Murray
regretted by the time he got to American. (He included American,
even though it was too late for African.) And there was another
problem: the dictionary experimented with editorial styles as it
went along, failing to come up with a uniform system until the
letter M.
</P>
<P>
   Several supplements with younger, spryer words were published
over the years, the most recent appearing in 1986. In 1989 all the
entries were consolidated into what became known as the second
edition. But the dictionary as a whole has never received a
thorough going-over, until now. The vast majority of the words,
definitions and citations date to Murray's day.
</P>
<P>
   Under his stewardship words in the OED came almost exclusively
from the English literary canon, from the earliest Old English
poets to the latest Victorian novelists. Some rude words were left
out, and there were few citations from works published later than
1900. But the current editors, aided by a worldwide network of
volunteers, are consulting documents from the United States,
Australia and other English-speaking countries, and using
nonliterary works from the past and the present.
</P>
<P>
   A written inventory of Henry VIII's holdings after his death,
for instance, has yielded a surprisingly early use of the term
``breakfast table.'' It has also proved the source of the earliest
known use of the adjective ``rat-eaten,'' in descriptions of the
late king's worse-for-wear household linen, said Bernadette Paton,
one of four principal editors at the OED. ``Personal letters,
wills, travel diaries _ they're all a great source that weren't
available to us before,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rechecking all the entries and adding new ones is no easy
matter, even though it is being done by a team of hundreds,
including 60 editors and research assistants at the Oxford
headquarters, 200 consultants in universities and at businesses and
an army of free-lance contributors. So far only a sliver of the
dictionary _ the 1,045 words between the letter M and the word
mahurat (a word of Hindi origin meaning ``an auspicious moment for
beginning an enterprise'') _ has been completely revised.
</P>
<P>
   Some entries, like the Australian phrase ``mad as a meat ax,''
have grown to incorporate new scholarship. Others have been added
wholesale after a rigorous vetting process in which, among other
things, a word has to be cited in print in at least five different
places by five different authors. New words that have made the cut
include Ma-and-Pa store; mack, American slang meaning a
smooth-talking ladies' man; magnum force; and mad cow disease. From
other parts of the alphabet there is himbo (the male equivalent of
a bimbo), mellowing out, post-traumatic stress disorder,
eco-terrorist, get a leg over (British slang for make love) and
e-mail.

<P>
   Graeme Diamond, 27, a senior assistant editor with longish hair
and eclectic passions, is the resident voice of youth in the OED
office. Under his direction the dictionary is drawing on
contemporary sources from rap music, sports, fashion, politics and
the like.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I really enjoy is finding new things to put in,'' Diamond
said. In a recent instance he was thrilled to unearth documentary
evidence for the expression ``pile of pants,'' British slang for
rubbish or nonsense. (Pants is one of those words that take
different meanings on different sides of the Atlantic: it means
underpants in Britain and trousers in the United States.)
</P>
<P>
   As an expression of displeasure, pile of pants is generally used
in connection with pop culture, as in the example now immortalized
in the OED ``Yup, this is a pile of pants,'' a reviewer said of a
rock concert last year in The Glasgow Herald, ``and no amount of
hip paranoia is going to convince me otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, slangy English is seeping into written language much
faster now than it did 100 years ago, said Edmund Weiner, the OED's
principal philologist, whose business is the origin and history of
words.
</P>
<P>
   ``One hundred years ago it wasn't respectable to put a lot of
colloquial language and slang words into print,'' Weiner said.
``It's only been in the last century that the gap between written
and spoken language has narrowed.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, should something as low-rent as ``pile of pants'' be
allowed in the eminently respectable OED, alongside Chaucerian,
Shakespearean and Faulknerian English?
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely, the dictionary's editors say. As staid as it may
appear to the untrained eye, the OED no longer discriminates
against words that are racy, rude or offensive. It is an
equal-opportunity dictionary, and it embraces whole categories of
words and expressions that, for instance, would never be printed in
The New York Times _ at least not under the paper's current rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``The OED is authoritative, but it's not prescriptive,'' said
Jesse Sheidlower, the principal editor of the dictionary's North
American editorial unit. He is an expert on slang who is charged
with bringing in all manner of new American (and Canadian) words
and citations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dictionary tells what the history of the language has been
and how words have been used,'' Sheidlower continued. ``If that
includes words that some people think are ungrammatical or vulgar,
the OED has a responsibility to include them anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   As exotic as the electronic OED might seem, it is still the same
old dictionary at heart. Many of its new words and citations still
come from volunteers, known as readers, who mail in candidates just
as readers did a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   In Murray's day one of the most learned and prolific of the
contributors was an inmate at the Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum
named Dr. W.C. Minor. Today one of his spiritual descendants is
Stuart Y. Silverstein, who does not live in a mental hospital. (He
lives in Los Angeles.)
</P>
<P>
   Silverstein is a lawyer, the author of ``Not Much Fun: The Lost
Poems of Dorothy Parker'' (1996) and an expert in American usage
from the early 20th century. He became an OED contributor several
years ago when he was trawling through a Life magazine from the
1940s and saw a reference to the noun ``hit,'' in the sense of
murder-for-hire.
</P>
<P>
   He looked the word up in the OED, which gave 1970 as the
earliest known use. And that was the beginning of a beautiful
friendship in which Silverstein has contributed crucial information
about hundreds of words, including pastrami, gimmick and movie
star. The dictionary's editors consider him one of their richest
sources of Americana.
</P>
<P>
   Silverstein said he was motivated by a desire for historical
precision, a feeling of competitiveness and a sense that the
dictionary is an important constant in a fickle world. ``Tomorrow
morning you could wake up and go outside and be hit by a truck,''
he said. ``But have you contributed anything to the world?''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``No one's going to remember what I did in law.
But I know that no matter what else happens, I will have done
something to make a contribution to knowledge.''

 &HT;    OFFICIALS SEE LONG U.S. STAY FOR ELIAN, FATHER AS TRANSFER NEARS
 &HT;    850&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the government prepared to ``do what is
necessary'' this week to transfer Elian Gonzalez to his father,
Justice Department officials said Sunday they expected Juan Miguel
Gonzalez to remain in the United States until a federal appeals
court rules on custody of the boy.
</P>
<P>
   A scheduled meeting Monday between Elian's Miami relatives and a
panel of child psychology experts appeared in doubt after the boy's
21-year-old cousin and primary caretaker, Marisleysis Gonzalez, was
reportedly again hospitalized for exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether that meeting takes place, attorneys for
Lazaro Gonzalez, the great-uncle who has been caring for the
6-year-old Cuban rafter since late November, prepared to file
another round of court petitions designed to block Attorney General
Janet Reno's order that he be transferred to his father this week.
</P>
<P>
   Reno and Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder repeated that they
expect the Miami relatives to agree to a peaceful transfer of
custody. ``We will do what is necessary to reunite father and son,
however,'' Holder insisted.
</P>
<P>
   With a climax to the months-long drama apparently only days
away, events Sunday occurred on three fronts:
</P>
<P>
   _ In Washington, Elian's father met with the
government-appointed psychologists and with the Florida fishermen
who rescued his son.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Miami, demonstrations by those opposed to the boy's return
to Cuba continued. About 40 cars draped with banners formed a noisy
procession through city streets, and about 200 demonstrators
continued their vigil near the Little Havana house where Elian is
staying.
</P>
<P>
   _ Justice officials and others involved in the case presented
their arguments in a round of television talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting described as emotional, Juan Miguel Gonzalez met
with Sam Ciancio and Donato Dalrymple, the two cousins who found
Elian floating in an inner tube three miles off Fort Lauderdale on
Nov. 25. Elian's mother and 10 others died when their boat sank
while fleeing Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The fishermen, who have said they want Elian to remain in the
United States, said they were warmly greeted by Juan Miguel, who
offered to have them visit his son in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was eternally grateful to me. He embraced me. And you can
tell that it was not fabricated,'' Dalrymple said. He said Juan
Miguel ``feels so bad ... he feels that his boy has been held back
from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez also met with the psychologists at the office of his
attorney, Gregory Craig, according to Craig, who gave no details of
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Reno and Holder, appearing on several news programs, said they
expected Juan Miguel Gonzalez to remain in the United States until
the appeals process was completed. However, they differed slightly
over whether the government would force Gonzalez to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, in a CNN interview, said she thought the father would
voluntarily agree to remain during the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Holder, appearing on NBC, acknowledged that the Justice
Department had the legal authority to order the father to stay in
the United States. ``If we had to, we would be prepared to do
that,'' Holder said. ``But, as I said, I don't think we're going to
have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig, also appearing on NBC, said his client was prepared to
remain in the United States during the appeal, which he predicted
could last up to 10 months. He repeated Gonzalez's request that a
group of Elian's classmates and teachers be allowed to come to the
United States as a ``support group.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said she did not believe the appeals process would last
that long and made no comment on whether the expanded group would
be allowed to join Juan Miguel here.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez has appealed to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Atlanta to overturn a federal court ruling upholding a
previous federal order giving Juan Miguel sole authority to speak
on Elian's behalf on immigration matters. A hearing on that appeal
is set for May 11.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, his attorneys planned to file a petition Monday in
state court in Miami challenging the father's fitness as a parent
and seeking to award custody to Lazaro.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Garcia-Pedrosa, an attorney representing the Miami
relatives, claimed on CBS that Juan Miguel Gonzalez had a ``violent
temperament. That's why he divorced Elisabeth,'' Elian's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia-Pedrosa claimed that Elian ``has told psychiatrists that
he is deathly afraid of his father, because his father beat him
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Holder, appearing on the same program, said there was no
evidence that Juan Miguel Gonzalez was an unfit parent and noted
that such suggestions have surfaced only in the past few days as
Elian's transfer appeared imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, in her CNN interview, said Juan Miguel Gonzalez apparently
had been a good father.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very special little boy. His father did a darn good
job raising him until he was 6, along with his mother. It's time we
reunited them. And, it's time we do it in a peaceful way. Elian
deserves that,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Still unresolved late Sunday was how the family would respond to
the instructions that they meet with the panel of psychologists and
help transfer Elian to his father.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Reno dated Saturday but released Sunday, Lazaro
Gonzalez said, ``It is my family's wish that all of us be present
at the meeting together,'' and added he was certain the experts
would want to meet with Marisleysis.
</P>
<P>
   A family spokesman said it was doubtful Marisleysis would be
physically able to meet with the experts on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Osberg-Braun, another attorney for Lazaro Gonzalez, said
the family objected to the terms of the meeting with the experts.
She said the family would prefer that the panel interview Elian and
determine whether he would be psychologically harmed by being
uprooted from the Miami relatives, particularly Marisleysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This little boy is going to lose his mother figure for a
second time,'' Osberg-Braun said on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, acknowledging the bond Elian has formed with the Miami
relatives, nevertheless said the four months he has spent with them
were not enough to outweigh the nearly six years he spent with his
father.
</P>
<P>
   Reno and Holder again denied reports the government has
finalized plans to use force to remove Elian from his Miami
relatives if they refuse to voluntarily relinquish him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not received, nor reviewed, nor approved any plans that
would do that,'' Reno said on CNN. But she said Justice officials
were preparing responses to various possible scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   Holder called suggestions that the government would move in on
the house in the middle of the night to seize Elian
``inflammatory,'' and ``totally untrue. ... The government does not
plan to rip him out of the house in the middle of the night.''
</P>
<P>
   Osberg-Braun said the Miami relatives would not forcibly resist
government agents if they came to the house in Miami to take Elian,
but she said she did not think Lazaro would ``morally'' agree to
take him somewhere else to meet his father.
</P>
<P>
   She said the family wants Juan Miguel to come to the Miami house
to get Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Craig said Juan Miguel Gonzalez would be willing to travel to
another neutral place to pick up his son, but would not travel to
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``The circumstances in Miami are so fragile, so passionate, so
emotional that it would be bad for Elian, and we have ruled that
out,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   Osberg-Braun said the family would not try to inhibit the
hundreds of protestors who have been filing the street outside the
house in Little Havana from making a human chain to resist such an
action. And she warned that Elian would be emotionally disturbed by
the prospect of being forced out of the house through the crowd of
shouting protestors.

CBS WONDERS WHERE `FALCONE' WENT WRONG 
</HEADLINE>
   By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Was ``Falcone'' throttled by ``The Sopranos''? Did
the new CBS series about the Mafia prove too tame in contrast to
the darkly funny, profane and complex HBO show about New Jersey
mobsters? Was CBS's core audience, traditionally older and female
viewers, simply turned off by all the violence? Or is there simply
Mafia overkill in television and movies?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, ``Falcone,'' a heavily promoted series
based loosely on the 1997 movie ``Donnie Brasco,'' has performed
dismally in its first few nights. And CBS executives, who said
post-mortems have begun on the series, are wondering why
``Falcone'' has been such a disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   No decision has been made about the future of ``Falcone,'' which
had a tepidly received two-hour premiere last Tuesday. Not only did
the show come in at No. 3 in its first hour, but its audience
dropped sharply in its second hour, an obvious sign of flagging
viewer interest. The show, which spans eight nights, continued
through the week, skipped Sunday night, and picks up again Monday
night through its final episode on Wednesday. No other shows have
been filmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel really badly,'' said Mark Johnson, one of the executive
producers of the series. ``CBS did everything possible that they
could. I was almost embarrassed at how much they promoted the show.
But it's clear that we didn't open, to use a movie term. Our
numbers weren't very good. And for some reason the show didn't
appeal to the CBS audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who also was a producer of ``Donnie Brasco,'' said the
shadow of ``The Sopranos'' weighed heavily on ``Falcone.'' He said:
``Every review mentioned `The Sopranos.' We have an entirely
different show. What can you do?''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Ender, senior vice president for communications at CBS
Entertainment, said: ``We developed a terrific show and supported
it with an aggressive programming and promotion strategy. It
doesn't appear to be working but we're proud that we tried it. In a
changing marketplace, we cannot shy away from trying things
differently.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS is hardly alone in its disappointment for its newest show.
Another new series, ABC's ``Wonderland,'' which has stirred even
more publicity than ``Falcone'' and is about a hospital for the
criminally insane, has also failed to lure audiences, perhaps
because its subject is dark and intense. Like that of ``Falcone,''
the future of ``Wonderland'' is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Falcone'' is based on the story of Joseph Pistone, a former
undercover agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation who led a
double life as a suburban father working for the government and an
ambitious mobster named Joe Falcone. Pistone was an adviser to the
show, which stars Jason Gedrick as Falcone and Titus Welliver as a
mobster.
</P>
<P>
   The reviews for the show were mixed, comparing it negatively to
``The Sopranos,'' but also raising questions about whether
``Falcone'' broke any new ground in the Mafia genre. As television
executives repeatedly point out, the viewing audience of HBO's
``Sopranos'' is small, at around 6.4 million for its Sunday night
episodes, compared to network audiences.
</P>
<P>
   The Mafia genre has been heavily mined in films like Francis
Ford Coppola's classic ``Godfather'' movies, as well as Martin
Scorsese' ``Goodfellas'' and ``Casino'' and comedies like ``Married
to the Mob,'' directed by Jonathan Demme, and ``Analyze This,''
directed by Harold Ramis.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset executives at CBS as well as other networks were
surprised, if not startled, by the weak response to ``Falcone.'' In
the first hour of its premiere, the series came in third after
ABC's ``Dharma and Greg'' and ``Sports Night,'' and NBC's ``Will
and Grace'' and ``Just Shoot Me.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more significant was the drop-off in the second hour. In
its first hour ``Falcone'' had 11.6 million viewers. In its second
hour the number dropped to 9.3 million. It didn't help ``Falcone''
that ABC's ``NYPD Blue'' was its rival in that second hour, with an
audience of 15.5 million. The No. 2 show, ``Dateline NBC,'' had
13.1 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   After the premiere ``Falcone'' lagged behind its rivals. On
Wednesday, for example, the show was No. 3 with only 7 million
viewers, in contrast with NBC's ``Law and Order,'' with 18 million
viewers, and ABC's ``20/20,'' with 12.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend the number of viewers of ``Falcone'' picked up
a bit. On Friday 8.6 million viewers watched ``Falcone,'' behind
ABC's ``20/20'' (11.9 million) and NBC's ``Law and Order: Special
Victim's Unit'' (10 million). On Saturday ``Falcone,'' with 9.5
million viewers, came in second after the ABC broadcast of the film
``First Knight,'' with Richard Gere and Sean Connery (9.6 million
over three hours).
</P>
<P>
   But CBS was hardly upbeat about ``Falcone.'' A top CBS executive
said: ``Was the show, demographically, too much of a reach for our
audience? Was the promotion on target? Was it too mobster, or not
mobster enough?''
</P>
<P>
   Another CBS executive, who also spoke on condition of anonymity,
said there was some feeling that offering the series over eight
nights may have backfired, and that audiences probably did not want
to invest virtually every night in the same show. CBS officials
pointed out that several years ago the network made the mini-series
``Mario Puzo's The Last Don,'' which also starred Gedrick, and was
imitative of the author's ``Godfather.'' It proved highly
successful.
</P>
<P>
   But some rival network executives said that CBS, in seeking a
younger, male audience with ``Falcone,'' may have stretched the
limit for its core viewers. The network is populated by such
successful series as ``Judging Amy,'' ``King of Queens,'' ``Nash
Bridges'' and ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' which are especially
popular among older men and women. Trying to broaden a network's
reach can be hard: NBC recently had a cartoon series, ``God, the
Devil and Bob,'' which failed perhaps because that network's
audience was unaccustomed to such a show.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the producer of ``Falcone,'' said no one could be
faulted for its performance. ``CBS went out on a limb to support
`Falcone,''' he said. ``It was an attempt to appeal to a different
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Has he given up on the show? Johnson spoke candidly. ``It's not
my nature to give up,'' he said. ``I'm not conceding defeat, but
I'd be a liar if I said we were in good shape.''

SHOULD MICROSOFT'S FATE BE IN PRIVATE HANDS?  

</HEADLINE>
   By STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a federal judge ruling last week that Microsoft repeatedly
violated the law, the government has the easy part of the antitrust
case behind it. The real policy challenge comes now: what are the
right remedies?
</P>
<P>
   Last week's ruling came because of the breakdown of four months
of settlement talks _ mediated by Judge Richard A. Posner, a
federal jurist who is regarded as one of the leading thinkers on
antitrust _ in which the two sides could not agree on the
appropriate remedies.
</P>
<P>
   Robert E. Hall, an economist at Stanford University, has a novel
recommendation for the government. ``Just declare victory and walk
away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very effective means of dealing with the Microsoft
problem _ our system of private litigation,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   A senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and co-author of the
original flat-tax proposal in the early 1980s, Hall is a
conservative who believes antitrust laws are essential rules for
the health of free-market capitalism. He advised the Justice
Department's antitrust division on an earlier Microsoft case and is
also a respected economist who has been mentioned as a candidate
for the Nobel prize.
</P>
<P>
   Hall believes Microsoft's main offense was its restrictive
contracts and behavior, which artificially raised the barrier to
entry by potential challengers to Microsoft. He has devised a
method for measuring the damage the company's behavior caused to
consumers, and he explained his approach in a paper presented at
the American Economic Association's annual conference in January.
</P>
<P>
   Using rough assumptions, the Hall paper concluded the economic
damage from Microsoft's practices amounted to overcharging about
$10 for each copy of its Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Hall said the overcharge calculation could well
be higher, depending on what assumptions are used, so the total
damage caused by Microsoft's practices in recent years could be
more than $7 billion. And that is before the triple damages called
for in private antitrust suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you charge Microsoft three times the cost of the harm, it
is a huge disincentive to engaging in the same kind of
anticompetitive conduct ever again,'' said Hall, who added he has
no interest in serving as an expert witness in any of the private
suits against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Litan, a former justice department official who is
director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution, said
that if the government followed Hall's modest proposal, it would be
an ``utter abdication of governmental responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The government does not bring antitrust suits to prepare the
ground for private litigants, he said, but to ensure remedial steps
are taken to stop illegal behavior by a monopolist and prevent it
in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Litan said he had doubts about how well the private
litigants will do against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Microsoft is ready to fight a major war in the private
cases,'' he said. ``Its experts will argue that there is no proof
that consumers suffered from Microsoft's conduct. And there is not
a lot of evidence in the government's case of the current damage
that consumers suffered.''

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: NO SWELLING UNSEEN CHORUSES, JUST HARD TRUTH ON
FILM 
</HEADLINE>
   By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. _ The air here on Thursday evening was soft and
warm, the gentle denouement to a perfect southern spring day of
80-degree temperatures and sultry breezes.
</P>
<P>
   But on one of the three screens in the Carolina Theater, a
handsomely restored Beaux-Arts cinema in the center of the city, a
band of explorers was risking death from exposure and starvation as
they weathered the brutal extremity of the polar climate with
dwindling supplies and failing equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the 35-mm cameras they had brought along by ice
boat, seaplane and dirigible on their expeditions across Antarctica
and the ice fields of the frozen North did not fail. The explorers
_ lonely, silent figures etched into the blankness of the landscape
like figures drawn on an empty page _ were accompanying Roald
Amundsen, the Norwegian adventurer whose life and legend are the
subject of ``Frozen Hearts,'' a new documentary by Stig Andersen
and Kenny Sanders that opened the third annual Double Take
Documentary Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frozen Hearts'' is a curious, unwitting collaboration between
filmmaker and subject. Amundsen, whose plane was lost over the
Arctic before the advent of sound film, shot his earlier treks with
the intention of recording his own intrepid heroism, but Andersen
and Sanders use the film he and his crews shot, along with
re-enactments and mordant voice-over narration, to rub some of the
luster from Amundsen's self-burnished legend and to bring to light
the narcissism and callousness lurking beneath his undeniable
bravery.
</P>
<P>
   A documentary is a film that uses real people to tell a true
story. This definition turns out to be as complex as it is
straightforward. Over the four days of the festival, which is
affiliated with the Center for Documentary Studies at Duke
University, 50 films, culled from more than 400 submissions, were
shown in competition for jury and audience awards. An additional
two dozen or so appeared as part of special out-of-competition
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The jury prize was awarded to ``The Way I Look at You: Five
Stories of Driving School,'' by Jean-Stephane Bron, which deals
with the offbeat interactions between driving instructors and their
students.
</P>
<P>
   The audience award was shared by Edward Rosenstein's ``The
Gospel According to Allen,'' an examination of life in a Harlem
drug-treatment center, and Linda Duvoisin's ``You Don't Know What I
Got,'' an intimate look at the lives of five American women. At the
prompting of an audience member the jury added an award for best
short film to Eugene Richards for ``But, the Day Came,'' about a
92-year-old Nebraska farmer.
</P>
<P>
   It was impossible to see everything at what is the largest
festival of its kind in North America, and it was also impossible
not to be struck by the elasticity and capaciousness of the
documentary form.
</P>
<P>
   Though the range of subjects was impressive _ from Amundsen to
the late Alabama Gov. George Wallace to the illustrator Barry
Moser, from the inmates at a juvenile detention center to devotees
of fast-pitch softball to the members of a Bombay ``laughing club''
_ the films also displayed a remarkable diversity of visual styles,
narrative methods and influences.
</P>
<P>
   D.A. Pennebaker and Chris Hegedus, who were at the festival to
receive its lifetime achievement award, represent the still-lively
tradition of cinema verite that was pioneered by filmmakers like
Albert Maysles, Richard Leacock and Pennebaker himself in the
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Their best-known work from that era, like ``Don't Look Back,''
Pennebaker's film about Bob Dylan, was made according to the
principle that the filmmaker should be as unobtrusive as possible,
allowing the story to tell itself and forswearing devices like
narration, interviews and music. But Pennebaker and Hegedus, a
married couple whose films together include ``Town Bloody Hall,''
``The War Room'' and ``Moon Over Broadway,'' don't regard
themselves as purists.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no rules,'' Pennebaker remarked during a panel
discussion on Friday on the subject ``representing reality.'' The
power of documentary derives not from any set of formal procedures
but from the relationship between the filmmakers and their subject.
``The audience should never lose the sense of that relationship,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   A number of the films shown in competition, including ``The
Sound and the Fury'' by Josh Aronson, about a deaf family, and Liz
Garbus' ``Juvies,'' which follows three teen-agers through the
Maryland juvenile justice system, share this ethic. ``I try to open
myself to the characters and let them lead the story,'' Garbus
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another filmmaker whose influence was clearly in evidence was
Ken Burns, who showed a portion of his 10-part, 18{-hour series
``Jazz'' (to be broadcast on PBS in January) on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Burns' style _ slow pans across still photographs accompanied by
evocative music, sonorous narrative alternating with talking-head
recollections and interpretations, individual stories flowing like
tributaries into a larger narrative stream _ is immediately
recognizable.
</P>
<P>
   It has become the standard for public-television historical
documentaries like his brother Ric's ``New York'' series (part of
which was shown here), Barak Goodman's somber ``Scottsboro: An
American Tragedy'' and Peter Stekler and Daniel McCabe's boisterous
``George Wallace: Settin' the Woods on Fire,'' also festival
entries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The documentary,'' Burns said in an interview, ``offers not
only unlimited subject matter but the widest possible spectrum of
stylistic approaches.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also an impulse that finds expression in a variety of
media. Burns shoots and edits on film, as did Pennebaker and
Hegedus until last year, but the field is increasingly dominated by
video, which is cheaper and more portable than film and which makes
up for its relative lack of visual depth and beauty with a sense of
immediacy and verisimilitude.
</P>
<P>
   The accessibility of the new technology means that filmmakers
can shoot first and look for production money and distribution
later. Sheila Nevins, vice president in charge of documentary
programming at HBO, who received the festival's industry award,
used to receive written proposals from filmmakers hoping to sell
their movies to her network. Now she receives videotapes.
</P>
<P>
   Nevins _ whose productions include this year's Oscar-winning
``King Gimp,'' and Alan and Susan Raymond's ``Children in War''
(shown in competition here), as well as late-night soft-porn
sociology series like ``Taxicab Confessions'' and ``Real Sex'' _
said in a telephone interview: ``It used to be that to tell your
story in a moving picture was a costly thing. Now someone can make
a film for nothing and sell it to us. They can shoot on their own,
edit at the kitchen table and sell it to HBO.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Though all of the festival entries were projected on wide
screens in spacious, ornate theaters, the largest of which even has
a balcony and mezzanine, they are most likely to be seen in the
future on television.
</P>
<P>
   PBS and HBO are established outlets for nonfiction movies, as
are basic cable channels like A&AMP;E, Discovery and the History
Channel. But the most visible presence at this year's festival was
MTV, which was a major sponsor and which presented a special
program on youth called ``Outside Looking In: Coming of Age
Stories,'' with the director Alan Berliner as curator.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the films in competition were included in this program,
along with relevant older works like Frederick Wiseman's ``High
School'' (1968), Martin Bell's ``Streetwise'' (1984) and David Van
Taylor's ``Dream Deceivers,'' a film made in 1993 for PBS about a
Nevada teen-ager whose parents blamed his suicide attempt on the
heavy-metal band Judas Priest.
</P>
<P>
   The issues Van Taylor explored _ the relationship among
violence, family and popular culture in the lives of American young
people _ have been a staple of MTV's news and documentary
programming in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionalists may object to MTV's fast cutting and jazzy
camera angles, as well as to its canny use of popular music to
underscore _ or undermine _ what is being said on camera. But
Lauren Lazin, the channel's vice president in charge of news and
documentaries, said these techniques reflect the sensibilities of a
sophisticated, media-savvy audience while upholding the basic
documentary tenet of telling stories truthfully and
sympathetically.
</P>
<P>
   And MTV, which showed some 30-second public-service
announcements as part of its presentation, has sufficient faith in
its audience's attention span to have begun co-producing
feature-length documentaries like Banks Tarver's ``I'm a Pro
Wrestler'' and Garbus' ``Travelers,'' about a group of homeless
young people.
</P>
<P>
   Films like these will jostle for attention on a broadcast
spectrum crowded with ``reality programming'' of every kind and
quality. But a festival like this one offers a sustained,
concentrated exposure to the sheer emotional power of documentary
filmmaking, its ability to communicate the drama embedded in human
experience. In Durham last week you could walk into the stately
dark of the Carolina Theater and lose yourself in real life.

 &HT;    Bush prepares priorities for 2001 legislative sessionBy Ken
Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In his Capitol office last week, sandwiched
between coast-to-coast presidential campaigning in Pennsylvania and
California, Gov. George W. Bush dropped in for some cramming toward
something he hopes to miss: the 2001 session of the Texas
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush priorities, in the embryonic stages at the staff level,
include transportation, math and efforts to preserve his legacy
after he is gone, sooner or later. The governor acknowledges all
these issues could be overshadowed by the anticipated battle to
redraw legislative districts, but he has decided to let lawmakers
take the lead on this issue, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush hopes the nation's voters will make it sooner by handing
him the White House keys in November. The 2001 legislative session
opens Jan. 9. The next president takes office Jan. 20, though Bush
might resign from his current job before then if he is elected
president.
</P>
<P>
   The peculiarities of working toward a legislative session the
boss hopes to avoid are not lost on Bush aides.
</P>
<P>
   ``We come to work every day and play like this really means
something,'' said Terral Smith, Bush's top legislative aide. ``And
it might. You never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, while Bush was in a meeting on transportation
issues, the man who could be governor next January was meeting with
key legislators in his Capitol office. Republican Lt. Gov. Rick
Perry expects Bush to become president, which means Perry expects
to become governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the constitution requires that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It all adds up to an unprecedented run-up to a Texas legislative
session as Bush tries to become the first incumbent Republican
governor to win the White House since Ohio's William McKinley did
it in 1896.
</P>
<P>
   If he fails, Bush would become the first Texas governor to serve
during four consecutive legislative sessions. Last year, halfway
through the third session, Bush aides already were bemoaning the
difficulty in coming up with ideas and enthusiasm for a fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Bush insists there is no lack of either. During a campaign-trail
interview last month, Bush was asked if he is preparing for the
legislative session he may not see.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush took a pass when asked to name some legislative
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``My staff has been working on something,'' he said. ``I will
sit down and visit them about it, but I intend to win. But this
summer I'm going to spend some time (working on legislation). Our
staff has been working on some ideas. I will discuss it after they
brief me.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith says it's not hard to get Bush's attention _ when he is in
town.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier than one might suspect because when you get him in
the office he seems to like to work on these issues,'' said Smith.
``It's like a respite from the other campaign, and my view from
just watching him and listening to him is that this is so easy for
him compared to the national campaign and maybe some of the
national issues. He is so familiar with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't found that his mind is somewhere else when he is
with us _ when we've got him in the office,'' Smith said. ``And
that's about a day and a half a week right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Transportation, targeted as a key quality-of-life issue, is a
primary part of the Bush package being ginned up in case Al Gore
becomes president. At the heart of the issue is a desire to
streamline the road-building process.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a culture in the Texas Department of Transportation
that we need to begin to break, and it's a culture that makes
things go slow,'' said one Bush adviser. ``It's a culture of, 'This
is the way we've always done it and it's always worked.'''
</P>
<P>
   One thing getting attention from Bush's staff is the possibility
of spending up to $1 billion _ half in cash, half in bonds _ to
build more beds for a state prison system about to hit capacity
again, as well as provide pay increases for prison guards. Finding
money for health insurance for teachers also is on the drawing
board. Currently, the state does not help pay for insurance
premiums and local districts have the option to help.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, between surplus and anticipated new revenue, early
projections show Texas lawmakers could have an additional $5
billion to spend for the next two-year budget cycle. The current
two-year budget totals $98.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   On education, a Bush priority in previous sessions, the governor
wants to focus on math as he has on reading in previous years,
including special training for teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the works is a strategy to protect his legacy. The
governor's staff is looking for lawmakers _ preferably younger ones
who will be around for a while _ to fend off future efforts to undo
key portions of Bush's programs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's long-range impact on state government also is being
addressed through the appointments process. Many of his first
appointees, named in 1995, come to the end of their terms next
February. Bush can begin appointing a new round of appointees to
serve another six years.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has began making changes in leadership at major state
agencies, naming new chairs for the Texas Lottery Commission, Texas
Department of Transportation and Texas Real Estate Commission, with
others expected.
</P>
<P>
   Come January, if Bush is gone, his legislative package would be
passed on to Perry in an advisory capacity. Perry, who already has
staked out higher education as his priority issue, says he would be
glad to take a look at anything Bush leaves behind.
</P>
<P>
   Perry says his staff has been in close touch with Bush's, but a
source in the governor's office says it's been something of a
balancing effort to make sure that House Speaker Pete Laney, a
Democrat who has worked well with Bush, doesn't get his nose out of
joint.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, when Laney _ something of a natural legislative rival
of Perry _ had an inkling that Bush was working with Perry on
appointments, he made it clear it was not appreciated. In no
uncertain terms, Laney let Bush's staff know that Perry is not yet
the governor of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Perry has doubts that the 21st century's first
legislative session will be one for the ages.
</P>
<P>
   ``During a session that a substantial number of the members are
going to be focused on redistricting, I think the idea that this is
going to be an ambitious session on any issue would be a stretch,''
he said.

</P>
<P>
   Snow flurries will linger over northern New England and winds
will slowly diminish as an intense storm pushes north to Labrador.
Dry, chilly weather will persist over southern New England.
</P>
<P>
   A new storm will develop quickly over Kansas and spread
inclement conditions into the Middle West and southern Great Lakes.
There will be light to moderate snow, with accumulations of up to
several inches, from Fargo, N.D., to Milwaukee. A cold rain will
soak much of Iowa and thunderstorms will develop over Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   A flow of warm and more humid air from the Gulf of Mexico will
cause thundershowers in Texas. Stronger storms may develop Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered showers will accompany low pressure near the Four
Corners. High pressure building into the Pacific Northwest will
drive low clouds offshore in some sections. The Southwest will turn
cooler with ample sun.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Ground Zero
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the mercury rose to 76 degrees in Albany, N.Y.,
before a sharp cold front reached the Hudson Valley. By Sunday
afternoon, over a foot of snow had fallen on the capital district,
driven by 30-mph winds. This April snowstorm was the third-largest
on record since 1884. An exceptionally intense low-pressure system
formed over Long Island, N.Y., and moved slowly along the New
England coast, as frigid air swept into eastern New York. Another
period of snow is possible by Tuesday.

   YUGOSLAV-TRIBUNAL (The Hague, Netherlands) _ Confounding the
many critics who long called the international tribunal here a mere
fig leaf for Western shame, the court dealing with Yugoslav war
crimes has just completed an extraordinary month. It has opened the
first U.N. trial ever to focus exclusively on sexual violence
against women, such as gang rape and the use of women as sexual
slaves as part of war strategy. It has also begun the trial of one
of the top generals alleged to be responsible for the carnage in
1995 at the Bosnian town of Srebrenica, probably Europe's worst
massacre of civilians since World War II. By Marlise Simons.

wave of tax reductions. ``The states are overflowing with money and

`NAKED': MIRA SORVINO TWISTS IN UNFORGIVING WINDS OF LIVE THEATER 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Opportunities for emotional connection between actors
and audience are scarce in the clueless new revival of Luigi
Pirandello's ``Naked,'' which opened Sunday night at the Classic
Stage Co. in one of those productions that make you want to look
anywhere but at the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, every so often, a blurring of the lines between
performers and theatergoers occurs that might, in a pinch, qualify
as Pirandellian. This occurs every time the evening's star, Mira
Sorvino, looking wan and exhausted, clutches her stomach in a
gesture that suggests something more piercing than mere gastric
distress.
</P>
<P>
   You get the fleeting impression that some transubstantiated part
of her has joined the spectators in the dark and been forced to
observe what's going on up there in the footlights. Ouch. It really
hurts.
</P>
<P>
   Watching a gifted film actress, which Sorvino undeniably is,
twist in the unforgiving winds of live theater isn't much fun, but
the experience appears to be on its way to becoming a tradition at
the Classic Stage Co. Last year the troupe gave us Uma Thurman
battling her way through the rhymed couplets of Moliere's
``Misanthrope'' like an unclothed baby in a briar patch.
</P>
<P>
   Now here is Sorvino, the Oscar-winning star of ``Mighty
Aphrodite,'' wrestling with a role defined by its very lack of
identity, something the actress principally suggests by keeping her
voice low, soft and flat. One is grateful to the Classic Stage Co.
for encouraging vital young screen talents to cut their teeth in
the New York theater. But surely this could be achieved with
projects a little easier on the molars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naked,'' a 1922 tale of a modern-day Melisande adrift in a
world of exploitative men, isn't easy to bite into under the best
of circumstances. Avoiding the diverting, form-bending mind games
of such better-known works by Pirandello as ``Six Characters in
Search of an Author,'' the play is instead a harrowing philosophy
lesson masquerading as a straightforward melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fascinating work, with its intimations that the greatest
human fear is not of death but of formlessness, of the lack of any
shaping personality. It received a London production from the
Almeida Theater in 1998, starring Juliette Binoche (another
Oscar-winning actress, by the way), that critics described as
riveting. But it's a wordy, often florid piece, and you can
understand why it is so seldom staged.
</P>
<P>
   The director, John Rando, who has shown a deft hand for comedy
on other occasions, has brought no discernible point of view to
``Naked,'' which is performed here in a new translation by the
dramatist Nicholas Wright. Indeed, the only confident interpretive
elements of the production are technical, manifested in Derek
McLane's set, Russell H. Champa's lighting and David Van Tieghem's
sound, which collectively suggest an uneasy interpenetration of
public and private worlds.
</P>
<P>
   At the play's center is Ersilia Drei (Sorvino), a beautiful and
cryptic young woman whose attempted suicide has been chronicled
breathlessly in the Italian newspapers. The tragedy that inspired
the attempt is rehashed by a novelist (Daniel Benzali) who has
taken her in as a resident muse, a journalist (Bray Poor), the
novelist's prurient landlady (Rebecca Schull) and two pompous,
upper-class men from Ersilia's past (Peter Rini and Michel R.
Gill). The flow of information, as rendered here, is not what you
would call fluid.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the overall effect is of people with headsets, as at a
United Nations conference, waiting for translations of what the
others have said before responding. There may be some thematic
point to this disjunctiveness, but here it registers as
amateurishly stilted.
</P>
<P>
   Her dark eyes feverishly aglitter in a deathly pale face,
Sorvino is a compelling presence when she takes her first tentative
steps onto the stage. Soon enough, however, the boundaries between
the discomfort of the character and of the actress portraying her
start to melt in ways that do nothing to enrich the play.
</P>
<P>
   Sorvino, whose sharp-edged portraits on film are notable for
their attention to vocal accent and timbre, is being asked to
create a woman who is effectively without a voice, who is
existentially naked. The resulting exposure is far more unfair and
unflattering than any physical nudity might be.

HENDERSON'S CRASH AND MEDIA BOYCOTT PART OF METS WACKY SEASON  
 RUSCH RETURNS  
 HAMILTON OPTIMISTIC  
 ANOTHER SNOW DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bobby Valentine has seen enough in his career to know
that in baseball, the unusual is common. So when the Mets' manager
showed up at Shea Stadium at 7:30 a.m. Sunday and was greeted by
harsh winds and a snow-covered field, he was bemused but not
surprised. The Mets' game against the Los Angeles Dodgers was
snowed out, another strange-but-true tale in an already eventful
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If abnormal is regular, as I feel it is,'' Valentine said,
``then this will be another regular, wacky, abnormal season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets and Dodgers will make up the game at 7:10 p.m. on April
24, a day on which the Mets had been scheduled off during a
homestand and the Dodgers were scheduled to travel from Cincinnati
to Atlanta. Sunday's game was the first that had been snowed out at
Shea since an exhibition with the Yankees on March 31, 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The game was postponed as most of the Mets were arriving at the
ballpark; some then took the team bus to Philadelphia, where the
Mets start a three-game series with the Phillies on Monday night.
Other players received permission to travel on their own Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Driving to Shea Stadium in the difficult conditions Sunday
morning, outfielder Rickey Henderson was involved in a minor
accident. Henderson's car was hit from behind just before getting
on the Grand Central Parkway, after he had left the Triborough
Bridge. Henderson's car was knocked into a guardrail and hit again
as the other car spun around.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson hit his head in the accident, but neither he nor the
other driver was hospitalized. Henderson continued on to Shea,
where he was examined by Mets trainers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We evaluated his condition and he seems to be OK,'' said the
trainer Fred Hina, who added Henderson was given no specific
treatment. ``There's no concussion. He's fine. Fortunately, the car
got the worst end of the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson did not have much to add. ``I'm alive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 41-year-old leadoff hitter, who has said his focus has
wavered because of unhappiness with his contract, said he is
boycotting the news media for a month. To illustrate why, he tore
off a newspaper article with the headline ``Rickey Must Go'' and
affixed it to the back of a television set hanging from the ceiling
in the middle of the Mets' clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a month,'' Henderson told reporters. ``I know you
went to school and they told you what a month is.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson's saga has been only one sideshow in a season already
filled with them. The Mets began the season in Japan, of course, so
they opened spring training earlier than most clubs. Valentine
conceded that it feels later in the year than it is.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's day off, then, was welcomed. The Mets would have been
without relievers Armando Benitez, who had worked three days in a
row, and Pat Mahomes, who started on Saturday. Another reliever,
Rich Rodriguez, sprained an ankle on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't like to play a game as many guys short as we were
today,'' Valentine said.  &QL; 
RUSCH RETURNS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Mets activated the left-hander Glendon Rusch Sunday, and
optioned the right-hander Eric Cammack to Class AAA Norfolk. Rusch
was scheduled to start Sunday, but his turn in the rotation will be
skipped and Bobby J. Jones will face the Phillies Monday night, as
planned.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine said Rusch will be available for relief work and will
start in Pittsburgh on Saturday or Sunday. Al Leiter's turn comes
up on Friday in Pittsburgh, but he has a strained groin and will
test it Monday by throwing 20 to 25 pitches in a simulated game at
Veterans Stadium. Mahomes, who worked five and two-thirds strong
innings in Leiter's place Saturday, will start for Leiter again if
needed, Valentine said.  &QL; 
HAMILTON OPTIMISTIC &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Darryl Hamilton did not accompany the Mets to
Philadelphia; he is on the disabled list with a sprained left foot
and will meet with a doctor Monday to determine how to treat the
injury. The 35-year-old Hamilton has been discouraged by the
lingering pain that accompanies his arthritic left big toe, but he
believes Monday's meeting will answer a lot of his questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that somehow, some way it will work out,'' he said.
``I'm not really too worried about it.''  &QL; 
RODRIGUEZ SAYS HE'S READY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rich Rodriguez aggravated a problem with his left ankle in the
weight room Saturday, but told Valentine he was available to pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years ago, I tweaked it in spring training,'' Rodriguez
said. ``It just flared up today. I told them I was ready, yesterday
and today.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez then joked that he got recognized for a minor ankle
injury, but not for the three scoreless innings he worked last
Wednesday. The left-hander, who was signed as a free agent from the
San Francisco Giants in January, enjoyed the lengthy relief stint;
he worked only 56 2/3 innings last year, his fewest in a full major
league season since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   He said he worked with Mets pitching coach Dave Wallace on
placing his foot in front of the middle of the rubber, instead of
toward the first base side. Rodriguez had been flying open with his
front shoulder when he tried to throw inside to right-handed
hitters.  &QL; 
ANOTHER SNOW DAY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mets outfielder Jon Nunnally was a pinch-hitter for the Kansas
City Royals at the Yankees' home opener in 1996, when it snowed in
the Bronx. Sunday's conditions at Shea were worse, Nunnally said,
but not by much.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a blizzard,'' he said. ``But it was snowing that day _
big flakes. Late in the game it started doing it, but it was
already freezing cold. We just kept playing on.''

HBO DOCUMENTARY MAKES BILL RUSSELL UNDERSTANDABLE, AND WARM 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bill Russell had just watched his life pass before
his eyes last week in the form of an HBO documentary when he stood
on a podium to say: ``I find the whole thing totally and completely
embarrassing. I rather enjoyed it, but to tell the truth, it was
boring because I'd seen everything in it before.''
</P>
<P>
   His infectious cackle filled the midtown Manhattan screening
room.
</P>
<P>
   Russell's enigmatic personality made him a long shot to be the
subject of an HBO documentary. If they are alive, they usually
cooperate with HBO. But Russell was not even on HBO's wish list
despite a compelling story that includes growing up in the Deep
South, 11 National Basketball Association championships in 13 years
with the Boston Celtics and a place in the civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   His distance from the sport he once dominated reinforced old
perceptions that he is aloof and enigmatic. And he didn't care. He
was at peace with his life and achievements. But his daughter,
Karen, and friends like John Thompson, his former Celtics backup,
urged him to leave his seclusion.
</P>
<P>
   So, last year Russell emerged to promote the ceremony for the
re-retirement of his number at the Fleet Center (the first time his
No. 6 was raised, he mandated that Boston Garden be empty) and
consented to many interviews to help sell tickets.
</P>
<P>
   An interview with Frank Deford for a long article in Sports
Illustrated last May led to Deford's telling HBO that Russell was
ready to tell his story.
</P>
<P>
   Ross Greenburg, the executive producer of HBO Sports, said: ``It
became intriguing to me that, at age 65, he hadn't sat down to tell
his story. The intrigue became that he wanted to tell it. I knew he
had compelling stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell said, ``We wanted to have the story told from our
perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Russell: My Life, My Way,'' makes its debut next Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Russell's decision to sit down with HBO contrasts with his
refusal to be interviewed by ESPN last year for its
``SportsCentury'' series. Russell was the only living member of the
top 50 athletes of the 20th century to decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was gracious, and made sure Karen talked to us, but if
you're willing to pay Bill Russell or contribute to his charity,
he'll talk to you,'' said Mark Shapiro, who oversaw production of
the series and who now runs ESPN Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Greenburg said Russell never asked for payment, charitable
contribution or editorial control. ``There were no constrictions,''
he said. ``Our only deal was he would promote the documentary and
appear at the screenings.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell, who had not appeared in a commercial for nearly 30
years, is now featured in spots for Coors and Invesco, a financial
services company. He also signs autographs for money, contradicting
his longstanding resistance to provide his signature to fans or
teammates for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   If Russell has projected coldness through his choice to be a
nonpublic person, the documentary makes him understandable, even
warms him up. The portrait of Russell here is not surprising: a man
who is smart, humane, intelligent, arrogant and unapologetic for
his life's choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Russell did not ask for permission to be a human being,''
Thompson said. ``Bill Russell wouldn't say, `Oh please, treat me
like a person.'''
</P>
<P>
   Racism is a leitmotif of his life, as it was for other
African-Americans of his generation. ``My mother told me the white
people in Monroe, La., were really quite mean,'' said Russell, who
was born in Monroe. ``And so she did everything she could to keep
me protected, so that they didn't get a chance to do anything to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 1957 National Basketball Association finals, Russell
recalled a St. Louis fan telling the Hawks star Bob Pettit: ``
`Hey, Pettit, don't get no chocolate on you.' And that was the
nicest thing I heard that night.''
</P>
<P>
   Touched by the welcome shown to him at a dinner in his honor at
a country club in Reading, Mass., in the early 1960s, Russell and
his family moved into a house there. But soon after, vandals
destroyed most of his trophies and defecated in his bed.
</P>
<P>
   But he played on a racially mixed, color-blind team that
recognized his greatness, and for a coach, Red Auerbach, who
preached Russell's defensive genius to those who mistakenly
believed the Celtics were Bob Cousy's team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Russell was this savior,'' said Tom Heinsohn, the
Celtics forward. ``Red became Bill Russell's John the Baptist. He
spread the word.''
</P>
<P>
   The words Russell spread about himself in the documentary may be
the last ones he offers willingly for 20 more years. When he
finishes promoting it, he will return to his current home on Mercer
Island, Wash. Quiet again. A pity. When he wants to be, Russell is
an electric personality incapable of being unrevealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years ago, I told my dad, `I have to talk to you, so put
in your hearing aid,''' he said about his father, Charlie, now 88,
after the screening.
</P>
<P>
   He said he sat in front of him and told him, right to his face,
that when he was a boy, he wanted to beat him up.
</P>
<P>
   Russell said his father smiled and replied: ``If you tried that
20 years ago, we would have had a good tussle. But now, I'd just
have to shoot you.''' &QL;

   With his first hat trick since 1997, Czerkawski led the
Islanders to a 3-2 victory over the Florida Panthers in front of
9,316 boisterous fans at the Nassau Coliseum. The Islanders ended
their season at 24-49-9, meeting Goring's goal of equaling last
year's victory total despite having a payroll of $16.4 million and
the youngest roster in the National Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been some radical changes since last year, and for
this young and inexperienced hockey club to win 24 games is a good
accomplishment and a real nice stepping stone,'' Goring said.
``We're only going to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Islanders may have built a solid foundation this season
with its young players, it is the imminent sale of the team to
Charles Wang, founder of Computer Associates, that fans hope will
resurrect the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``If new ownership comes in, there's nothing to stop this team
from progressing and progressing rapidly,'' said Mike Milbury, the
Islanders' general manager. ``For the sake of the franchise, for
the sake of the players, for the sake of the manager, it's time to
stop the bleeding.''
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders, who have missed the playoffs for six straight
seasons, have been plagued by declining attendance and diminishing
talent. Last year, citing annual losses of more than $10 million,
the current owners, Ed Milstein and Steven Gluckstern, moved such
high-profile, high-salaried players as Zigmund Palffy, Trevor
Linden, Bryan Berard and Bryan Smolinski. Milbury cobbled together
a team with minor-leaguers, juniors, college players and a handful
of veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Among those left was the 27-year-old Czerkawski, who Milbury
said had been, ``from time to time, a whipping boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Czerkawski, whom Goring challenged before the season by Goring
to become a more all-around player, responded with his best season,
leading the team in scoring with 35 goals and 70 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot on the table,'' said Czerkawski, who scored
goals at 12 minutes 28 seconds and 14:08 of the second period and
got the hat trick _ the only one this season by an Islander _ at
7:13 of the third period. Pavel Bure and Mike Sillinger scored for
the Panthers, but the rookie goalie Roberto Luongo made 29 saves
for the Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was pressure on me to produce, to be the offensive
guy,'' Czerkawski said. ``Personally, I am pretty happy. I wanted
to hit 30 goals, and I did.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice to finish strong. I got a lot of help today and
Roberto was brilliant.''
</P>
<P>
   Luongo made his first NHL appearance since being sent to the
minors on Feb. 29. ``It felt like it was my first game all over
again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Luongo, the Islanders' No. 1 draft choice last year, came back
from Lowell on Saturday after Kevin Weekes was injured in Friday
night's game. The Islanders face having two No. 1 goaltenders in
training camp this September, , a situation Goring said he would
address later.
</P>
<P>
   The play of Weekes, acquired with Dave Scatchard and Bill
Muckalt in the trade that sent Felix Potvin to Vancouver, was one
of the more pleasant surprises for the Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were definitely some players who played better than I
expected, including Eric Cairns and Brad Isbister and Tim
Connolly,'' Goring said. ``Tim exceeded what I thought he was going
to get done. As an 18-year-old, he did more than just make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he said he felt wonderful, adding that he appreciated
the irony of being the only hockey coach in the New York area not
fired despite having the worst record, Goring said he was very much
aware that the Islanders were still ``on the outside looking in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still only 24 wins,'' Goring said. ``But we feel this
group of people wants to get better'' &QL;

<P>
   DUCKTOWN, Tenn. _ Atlanta's Rebecca Bennett Giddens turned in
the performance of a lifetime Sunday on the Ocoee River, toppling
one of the icons of women's paddling and earning the kayak spot on
the 2000 Olympic Slalom team.
</P>
<P>
   Giddens, 22, was down 3.36 points after a slow first run plus
four penalty points on Saturday and came into Sunday's competition
an underdog.
</P>
<P>
   The leader, two-time Olympian Cathy Hearn of Garrett Park, Md.,
already had dealt with this kind of pressure in 1992 and 1996 and
won.
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, Hearn, 42, got an early message. She paddled
a flawless 126.07 (seconds), yet was buried by Giddens who blazed
down the raging whitewater course so fast that even two penalty
points only raised her score to 123.07.
</P>
<P>
   Giddens did her second run in 122.63 with four penalty points
for a total 126.63.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Leith of Grosse Point, Mich., surprised the crowd with a
strong 124.12 (two penalties) to finish second and Hearn dropped to
third, and out of the Olympics for the first time in more than a
decade, with a 129.36 (two penalties).
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, despite miserable weather, Atlanta resident Scott
Shipley secured his third consecutive Olympics berth with a
dominating performance.

   SUAN PHUM, Thailand _ Between them, the 12-year-old twins say,
they command 400,000 invisible soldiers. If anybody shoots at them,
the bullets just bounce off. And they can kill their enemies simply
by pointing a rifle at the ground and concentrating really hard.
</P>
<P>
   These might be the fantasies of a million schoolboys. But they
are the beliefs that have led grown men into battle _ the legends
that surround two child warriors who lead a ragged ethnic
insurgency called God's Army, just across the border in Myanmar,
the former Burma.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, one of the twins, Luther Htoo, went on a four-day
hike with 15 of his soldiers from his mountain hideout to the hills
along the border for his first interview since God's Army carried
out a suicidal raid on a Thai hospital in January.
</P>
<P>
   He met with Jason Bleibtreu, an American photographer and video
cameraman, and spoke with The New York Times by satellite telephone
_ a fidgety child with a little-boy voice who answered many of the
questions by turning to his followers and asking, ``What shall I
say?''
</P>
<P>
   After some discussion, some of his answers were these: He wants
freedom for his people, the Karen minority. He is invulnerable to
land mines and bullets. His favorite toys are real guns and
ammunition. And he misses his mother and father.
</P>
<P>
   On videotape he seems more like a spoiled mascot than a general:
He is carried through the woods on the shoulders of his men handed
a lighted cheroot whenever he murmurs, ``I want a smoke,'' and
tolerated benignly as he climbs in and out of the laps of the men
he commands.
</P>
<P>
   He sports a camouflage fatigue shirt with a ``U.S. Army'' patch,
a ``Love'' tattoo on his arm, and a new short haircut, and he turns
away from time to time to double over in a wrenching smoker's
cough.
</P>
<P>
   Luther and his brother, Johnny, did not join the January raid,
in which all 10 gunmen were shot dead after taking hostage more
than 800 patients and staff at a hospital in the town of
Ratchaburi. But the chain-smoking twins, with their long hair,
vacant expressions and claims of divinity, became the objects of
widespread curiosity abroad.
</P>
<P>
   They also became the targets of a stepped-up hunt by the Burmese
military, found themselves barred from their potential sanctuary in
Thailand and lost the support of other Karen rebels, who are now
under increased pressure on both sides of the border as a result of
the disastrous raid.
</P>
<P>
   On the run and short of food, the fighters say, God's Army has
split into three small groups. The twins, leading two of the
groups, now talk to each other only by hand-held radio. Altogether,
their men say, they command fewer than 200 fighters.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate interview here in a Thai border village, one of
the boys' followers, a 45-year-old guerrilla, talked at length
about the insurgency and the extraordinary legends that have grown
up around the Htoo twins.
</P>
<P>
   Using the Karen term ``bu,'' or ``little brother,'' he referred
to Luther as Bu Lu and to Johnny as Bu Joh, and he was careful to
note which miracles he claimed to have witnessed and which he had
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once, when Bu Joh was bathing in a stream, he shouted to
everybody, `Look at me!' and he jumped into the water,'' said the
guerrilla, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he came out he was an old man with long white hair and a
white beard,'' he said. ``All the soldiers were afraid, but he
said, `Don't be afraid: I'm Bu Joh! If you don't believe me, I'll
change back.' And he jumped back into the water and came out as a
boy again. I didn't see this myself, but more than 100 soldiers did
see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Several other incidents described by the guerrilla also suggest
that the boys are constantly proving their powers to skeptics.
</P>
<P>
   In one incident that he said he did witness, Luther gave each
fighter three magic bullets but admonished them to save them for
emergencies. One doubter disobeyed and shot one of the bullets at a
tree. When he checked the tree, there were 10 bullet holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that, he believed,'' the guerrilla said.
</P>
<P>
   In another incident, Luther sent his men into battle but
remained where he was, pointing his rifle silently at the ground.
Afterward he asked how many of the enemy had been killed. Twenty,
he was told. He then held up his rifle; exactly 20 bullets had
disappeared from its magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Legends like that challenge the imagination of most people,
including most other ethnic Karens. But one Karen student in
Bangkok, who is not a follower of God's Army, said he was ready to
believe that the boys are reincarnations of heroes from the past.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of charismatic holy men with claims to magical
powers ``is fairly common in Southeast Asia in times of trouble,''
said Sunai Phasuk, a Thai political scientist who has studied the
God's Army phenomenon. ``They don't have other sources of
reference, they don't have support from authorities, and they don't
have a big army, so they turn to supernatural beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Karens have been fighting a separatist insurgency since
Burma became independent of British colonial rule a half-century
ago. Most other ethnic groups have reached an accommodation with
the government in the last decade, but some Karens have continued
to fight. The emergence of God's Army in the last three years is a
sign of divisions and desperation as the Karens suffer defeat after
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Movements like God's Army are similar to end-of-the-world
movements that predict an imminent apocalypse, Sunai said. And
indeed, the guerrilla fighter quoted Luther as saying, ``Please
believe me, not too long from now the world will explode.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Like some other movements of this kind, God's Army lives by
ascetic rules. Although smoking is obviously permitted, alcohol,
drugs and adultery are banned, along with milk, eggs and pork. Many
Karens are Christian, and the boys are said to know the Bible by
heart, although they have never studied it.
</P>
<P>
   What is unusual about God's Army is that it is led, at least
nominally, by children.
</P>
<P>
   Their fighting force includes a number of other child soldiers,
the guerrilla said, many of them orphans of the war. Indeed, he
said, with God's Army split into three groups, a third 12-year-old
leader with magical powers has emerged. His name is Chopa Thupli,
or King of the Black Tongue.
</P>
<P>
   This boy, the guerrilla said, is actually 200 years old, a Thai
king who once fought against the Burmese and decided to return as a
Karen so that he could keep on fighting them.
</P>
<P>
   His divinity is believed to be shown by the black color of his
tongue, a sign among some people here of magical powers. The
guerrilla said the twins do not have black tongues, as others have
reported, and Bleibtreu also said it did not appear that Luther had
a black tongue.
</P>
<P>
   But the twins are also reincarnations of past leaders, with a
direct connection to heaven, the guerrilla said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny _ the funny, talkative one _ was born first and goes
everywhere first, he said, even though Luther has greater divine
powers. The difference is measured in the size of the armies they
command: Luther has 250,000 invisible heavenly soldiers while
Johnny has 150,000.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems that Johnny commands more of the everyday kind of
soldier. According to the guerrilla, he has about 100 fighters, who
protect some 300 civilian followers, apparently including the boys'
parents.
</P>
<P>
   Luther has about 30 fighters, although in the interview he had
to ask a subordinate for the number.
</P>
<P>
   The boys' parents are simple farmers without magical powers, the
guerrilla said. When the boys became leaders, their father put down
his hoe and took up a gun to follow them. And now, if he is in need
of special help, the guerrilla said, the boys will detach a
contingent of invisible soldiers to assist him.
</P>
<P>
   In their meeting with Bleibtreu on Thursday, the guerrillas _
both boys and men _ carried an assortment of M-16 and AK-47 rifles
and grenade launchers. They wore fatigues, shorts and a Donald Duck
T-shirt along with black head scarves and rubber sandals. Some were
barefoot.
</P>
<P>
   The deep forest was filled with bird song, the buzz of insects
and the constant dry coughing of the fighters.
</P>
<P>
   There was only one moment when gunfire seemed a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can shoot a weapon _ would you like me to show you?'' Luther
said to his visitor, but his soldiers told him, ``No, no, better
not, because the Burmese army might hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Bleibtreu said the soldiers seemed to treat the boy with a mix
of deference and patient parenting.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wouldn't allow him to act upon all of his whims,'' he
said. ``Sometimes he would want to ride on someone's shoulders. He
would motion, lift me up, lift me up, and they would talk him out
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   There seemed to be nothing extraordinary about this 12-year-old,
apart perhaps from his childishness.
</P>
<P>
   ``What struck me most was he seemed to want attention, emotional
contact,'' Bleibtreu said. ``He wanted more hugs from his mother.
He would sit down with me and put his hand on my shoulder. I got
the feeling he wanted me to hug him. He would jump from soldier to
soldier to their laps. The other boys weren't doing this. I felt
sad, as a father: jeez, this kid wants a hug.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, though, the atmosphere darkened for a moment as
Luther seemed to grow annoyed at the constant questions. ``He
yelled out, and everyone was quiet. It was almost like a bark, and
it was quite clear it was `Stop badgering me!' I was surprised, and
I was taken aback by it, and the people took it fairly seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the videotape, the group pauses in silence as one
of the fighters leads a prayer. And Luther, the holy man, could be
any child _ perhaps a 6-year-old child _ shifting and squirming in
boredom.
</P>
<P>
   Comfortably cradled in the lap of a tough-looking guerrilla, the
boy yawns and rubs his eyes. Then he rubs his face. Then with an
effort he sits forward and closes his eyes in an attempt at
concentration. Then he begins playing with a canteen cup, wiggling
its handle. Finally, as the men sing a closing hymn, Luther blinks
himself back to attention and joins in for a word or two.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrilla who is holding him seems used to this. He pays no
attention.

<P>
   Shots explode at a school in Oregon, a brokerage office in
Atlanta, or a church in Fort Worth, and the nation is witness to
another sudden, seemingly random violent rampage. Before the
ambulances leave, the news crews arrive. The killers' neighbors,
friends or families submit to interviews, and inevitably, they say
something like this: ``He just snapped.''
</P>
<P>
   But the killers do not just snap. An examination by The New York
Times of 100 rampage murders found that most of the killers
spiraled down a long slow slide, mentally and emotionally. Most of
them left a road map of red flags, spending months plotting their
attacks and accumulating weapons, talking openly of their plans for
bloodshed. Many showed signs of serious mental health problems.
</P>
<P>
   But in case after case, the Times review found, the warning
signs were missed: by a tattered mental health care system; by
families unable to face the evidence of serious mental turmoil in
their children or siblings; by employers, teachers and principals
who failed to take the threats seriously; by the police who, when
alerted to the danger by frightened relatives, neighbors or
friends, were incapable of intervening before the violence erupted.
</P>
<P>
   James Davis, whose co-workers had nicknamed him Psycho, warned
his colleagues at a tool warehouse in Asheville, N.C., ``If they
ever decide to fire me, I'll take two or three of them with me.''
His employers did fire him, and feared he would respond with
violence, but despite his threats, they failed to protect his
co-workers when Davis returned to take his revenge.
</P>
<P>
   In 34 of the 100 cases, however, families or friends of the
killers desperately did try to find help for a person they feared
was a ticking time bomb, but were rebuffed by police, school
administrators or mental health workers.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Seegrist caromed in and out of mental institutions 12
times in 10 years, while her parents searched for a residential
program where she could stay in treatment. They knew she was
dangerous. She had stabbed a psychologist and tried to strangle her
mother, and had hidden a gun in her apartment. But each time, she
was released from the hospital when she seemed to improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were always fearful that maybe some tragedy would happen,''
said Ruth S. Seegrist, Sylvia's mother. ``She threatened it:
`Someday before I kill myself, I'll bring some people down with
me.' '' Sylvia opened fire in a suburban Philadelphia shopping mall
in 1985, killing three people and wounding seven.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the recent spate of rampage-style mass shootings
in schools, workplaces, stores and other public places, The New
York Times re-examined 100 such violent incidents that occurred in
the United States over the last 50 years. The Times gathered
extensive information on all 100, and looked closely at more than
25 of the cases, a surprising number of which attracted little but
local attention.
</P>
<P>
   The examination included reviews of court cases, news coverage
and mental health records, and interviews with families and
friends, psychologists and victims, in an effort to glean what the
people closest to each tragedy had learned. In some cases,
reporters questioned the killers themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Based on this information, The Times found that in 63 of the 100
cases (which involve 102 killers), the killers made general threats
of violence to others in advance. Fifty-five of the 100 cases
involved killers who regularly expressed explosive anger or
frustration, and 35 killers had a history of violent behavior and
assaults. They were so noticeably unstable that even in their very
separate circles they had been awarded similar nicknames: ``Crazy
Pat,'' ``Crazy John,'' ``Crazy Joe.''
</P>
<P>
   And in 40 cases, family members and others said they noticed
sudden changes in behavior in the period before the rampage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you find out about each of these cases, the more it
makes sense,'' said Dewey G. Cornell, a clinical psychologist at
the University of Virginia and director of the Virginia Youth
Violence Project, which studies school safety and violence
prevention. ``This notion that someone just snaps is based on
ignorance and denial,'' Cornell said. ``People don't just snap.
Pressures build up.''
</P>
<P>
   Many psychologists caution that it is impossible to predict
violent behavior, and that most people who threaten violence never
follow through. Often, it is only in retrospect that each killer's
life appears to be a coherent chilling narrative foretelling
obvious danger. Looking back, it is easy to marvel, how could the
people who knew the murderer have failed to see it coming? In
particular, how could so many psychiatric workers, and even police,
have missed the warning signs?
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, there was no single person in the potential
killer's life to put together the lethal clues. Colleagues,
friends, family members, mental health professionals, teachers and
the police may have independently sensed something disturbing, but
they did not communicate with one another. Frightened neighbors or
co-workers decided it was safest to keep their distance. Friends
laughed off homicidal talk. Parents did not know where to turn, or
just hoped the irrational fury was merely a phase.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like looking at the night sky,'' said Dr. Robert
Granacher Jr., a psychiatrist in Lexington, Ky., who has examined
the records of several rampage murderers. ``If you only see one or
two stars, you may not see the whole constellation. It's the same
with these fragmentary bits of information; no one has the whole
picture.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the review of these cases suggests that if people
understood more about mental illness and connected the clues, many
of these rampage killings could be prevented.

<P>
   JAMIE ROUSE IN SCHOOL IN RURAL TENNESSEE
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Rouse, to a friend
</P>
<P>
   In rural Giles County, Tenn., on Nov. 15, 1995 _ before school
shootings regularly made headlines _ a slight 17-year-old strode
down the hall of Richland School with his black .22 Remington
Viper.
</P>
<P>
   His name was Jamie Rouse and, as always, he was dressed in
black. He walked up to two female teachers who were chatting in the
hall, and without a word shot each of them in the head. One teacher
was gravely wounded, the other died. Then Jamie Rouse smiled and
aimed for the school's football coach. But a student named Diane
Collins happened to cross his path. A bullet tore through her
throat. She was 16 when she died that day.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Rouse had sent distress signals for years to the adults in
his life. More startling, the police say he had told as many as
five teen-age friends exactly how he planned to bring his rifle to
school and begin killing. None of them had called anyone for help.
In fact, the night before, word of the planned massacre was passed
like macabre gossip along a chain of students, from Jamie, to his
close friend Stephen Abbott, to a teen-ager that Abbott worked with
at the gas station, Billy Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me something was going to happen at school the next
day, that I was going to lose a couple of friends,'' Rogers later
testified. ``Steve told me if there was a God he better make it
snow tonight so we ain't got school tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The rampage killers in the study, young and old, often talked
for months in advance about their murderous plans. And in 54 of the
100 cases, killers like Jamie Rouse provided explicit descriptions
of who, where or when they intended to kill.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Whitman, the infamous sniper who shot 45 people, killing
14, from atop the tower on the campus of the University of Texas at
Austin in 1966, had told a college psychiatrist four months before
the attack that he had been ``thinking about going up on the tower
with a deer rifle and start shooting people.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Carneal, a high school freshman in Paducah, Ky., told
schoolmates that ``it would be cool'' to shoot into a student
prayer group. He did as he had promised, killing three people and
injuring five in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Wurst, 14, showed a group of friends a gun hidden in his
father's dresser drawer and told them he planned to use nine shells
to kill nine people he hated, and then kill himself. In 1998, he
started shooting at his eighth-grade prom, killing a popular
teacher and injuring three other people.
</P>
<P>
   In case after case, friends, family members and others who heard
the threats and did not take action later said they did not act
because it seemed unfathomable that a human being would carry
through with such threats. Others said they had heard the killer
boast of violence so often that, like the villagers hardened to the
boy who cried wolf, they just did not take it seriously.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony, Stephen Ray, one of Jamie Rouse's closest friends,
said that it had sounded ridiculous when Rouse ``might have'' said
something about shooting someone the day before the killings, when
Rouse was fuming over a fender-bender with a schoolmate's car.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, now 21 and a college student in Knoxville, trembled in an
interview in his dormitory this winter when he said it was hard to
tell at the time that Jamie Rouse's blustery threats were real.
Even when Rouse showed up in the morning with a rifle and a box of
bullets, Ray said, he did not believe Jamie would really do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a joke,'' Ray said in a tone of amazement. ``It
wasn't a high school prank. It was something real.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee prosecutors said they were frustrated that legal rules
barred them from charging Ray with a crime because he did nothing
active to foster the plan. They did prosecute the teen-ager who
drove Rouse to school that morning.
</P>
<P>
   Failing to act in the face of warning signs, the prosecutors
said, was not a crime. In retrospect, there were many people guilty
of that.
</P>
<P>
   In ninth grade, Jamie had scratched an inverted cross on his
forehead, a symbol other students had told him was a sign of Satan
worship. Many people, including teachers, had noticed the mark,
which lasted a few weeks, and talked about it among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   At home during his junior year, Jamie held his brother Jeremy at
gunpoint and threatened to kill him. As punishment, Jamie's parents
took away his gun.
</P>
<P>
   As his senior year began, he submitted his entry for the
yearbook: ``I, Satan, James Rouse, leave my bad memories here to my
two brothers.'' By that time, according to testimony at his trial,
Jamie Rouse was working nights, taking Max Alert to stay awake and
Sominex to get to sleep, and listening to heavy metal music cranked
very loud because it drowned out the voices in his head that he
later told psychiatrists he had been hearing at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The spring before the shootings, Rouse got into a violent fight
with two other boys at school. But when teachers broke it up,
``Jamie just would not calm down,'' recalled Ronald W. Shirey Jr.,
the football coach that Jamie had missed shooting, in an interview
in his living room a few miles from the school. ``He was just
totally out of control, and saying, `I will kill you,' '' Shirey
said.
</P>
<P>
   The school called the police after that fight. Rouse faced
juvenile charges and was suspended for three days.
</P>
<P>
   But time passed. His mother later said it had not occurred to
her to get counseling for him. And when hunting season started,
Jamie's parents gave him his rifle back.
</P>
<P>
   Long after the crime, Shirey said, when government investigators
sought to study ways to prevent school shootings, they asked him to
circulate a survey among the teachers at Richland School, which
includes students from kindergarten to grade 12, to gather
information about Jamie Rouse. No survey came back with more than a
paragraph, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't find a teacher up there that was close to Jamie
Rouse since elementary school,'' Shirey said. ``Nobody knew enough
about him to say anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The adults noticed Jamie Rouse but did not know him, and the
teen-agers who knew him did not tell.

   SYLVIA SEEGRIST IN SUBURBAN PHILADELPHIA
</P>
<P>
   ``I genuinely thought the public would be pleased because I
thought all the public could see this and know and understand my
good-intentions.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Seegrist, in a letter to a reporter from prison, Jan. 4, 2000
</P>
<P>
   She was dressed in the green Army fatigues and knit cap she wore
all four seasons of the year as she drove into the parking lot of
the Springfield Mall in suburban Philadelphia. She leaped out of
her car firing a Ruger semiautomatic rifle, and continued spraying
bullets as she ran through the mall, killing three people and
injuring seven, all strangers. Among the dead was a 2-year-old boy
whose family had been shopping for a church charity fashion show.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Seegrist was 25 the day of her murder spree in 1985. The
crime was the culmination of 10 years of mounting psychosis,
crippling delusions and violent assaults on people who tried to
help her.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, in a recent interview in her apartment a few miles
from the site of Sylvia Seegrist's rampage, remembered the
``feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, despair, of incredible
sadness'' as she and her husband watched their only daughter
overtaken by schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   They also feared her. ``I'll take you out,'' Seegrist recalls
her daughter threatening.
</P>
<P>
   The Times' study found that many of the rampage killers,
including Sylvia Seegrist, suffered from severe psychosis, were
known by people in their circles as being noticeably ill and
needing help, and received insufficient or inconsistent treatment
from a mental health system that seemed incapable of helping these
especially intractable patients.
</P>
<P>
   Only a small percentage of mentally ill people are violent, and
many advocates bristle at any link between mental illness and
violence out of concern that it will further stigmatize an already
mistreated population.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Times investigation of this particular style of
violence _ public rampage killings _ turned up an extremely high
association between violence and mental illness. Forty-seven of the
killers had a history of mental health problems before they killed;
20 had been hospitalized for psychiatric problems; 42 had been seen
by mental health professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Psychiatric drugs had been prescribed at some point before the
rampages to 24 of the killers, and 14 of those people were not
taking their prescribed drugs when they killed. Diagnoses of mental
illness are often difficult to pin down, so The Times tabulated
behavior: 23 killers showed signs of serious depression before the
killings, and 49 expressed paranoid ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the killers who survived their rampages have made it
clear they prefer to be thought of as criminal rather than mentally
ill. Back in 1966, Robert Benjamin Smith, an 18-year-old high
school senior in Mesa, Ariz., said he believed he was God when he
herded five women and two children into the back room of a beauty
school, forced them to lie down in a circle and methodically shot
each person in the head, killing five of them.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter Smith sent to a Times reporter from prison in
January, he brushed off questions about illness and wrote,
``Lessons? The sole thing I have learned worth the telling is the
ironclad necessity of retaining control over one's essential bodily
fluids.'' He blamed ``sexual self-stimulation'' for his crime and
noted that he had tried to amputate his penis while in prison using
the pull-tab from a can of Diet Dr Pepper.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more ill they are, the less sensibility there is'' in the
violent attack itself, said Dr. Anthony G. Hempel, chief forensic
psychiatrist at the Vernon campus of North Texas State Hospital,
who has studied mass murderers. In contrast to the killers who ``go
postal,'' gunning for their bosses, Hempel said, ``when someone
goes and kills strangers or they kill children, the odds of them
being mentally ill are higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Seegrist was first hospitalized at 16, and schizophrenia
was diagnosed. Each of the dozen times she was discharged,
psychiatrists deemed that she no longer posed a threat to herself
or others.
</P>
<P>
   No one said she was getting better, though. At the local health
club Seegrist was seen taking steam baths in her camouflage
clothing. At the library, she spouted a tangle of theories about
nuclear weapons, energy shortages and famine. Between her
daughter's hospitalizations, Seegrist found a gun in Sylvia's
apartment, she said. Sylvia Seegrist told her mother she planned to
use it to kill her parents and then herself.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother said the family could not afford private
rehabilitation programs, and their insurance covered only
short-term hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Seegrist, now 39, is serving a life sentence at a prison
in Pennsylvania. She declined an interview, instead writing two
letters to The Times, a weave of lucid fragments and unintelligible
passages about benzene and Styrofoam. On the back of an envelope,
she writes that her killings were a form of public service.
</P>
<P>
   She also seems to assert that she had to kill to ensure she
would be imprisoned instead of being sent yet again to a state
mental hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure had all kinds of theories in my head,'' she wrote,
``expressed them at political meetings, just doll, understand,
please 10 yrs. of beat-up, orphan in state hospitals that are 300
percent worse than even Sing-Sing prison. All the throwaways
retarded smearing feces on themselves, when I read research
materials at Ivy league colleges, and watched nothing but CNN and
C-SPAN at home.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she had no choice. ``It had to be `a serious crime' or
I'd get the state hospital i.e. Nazi camp.''

   JEFFREY WALLACE IN KEY WEST AND JOSEPH BROOKS JR. IN DETROIT
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to save myself and my family.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Wallace, in a prison interview, Feb. 1, 2000
</P>
<P>
   Roxie M. Wallace knew something was wrong when her grown son
Jeffrey visited her and padlocked his room. He sometimes slept with
a knife by his bed. He was growing increasingly paranoid, she
realized. He would talk incessantly about evil forces. Most
disturbing, she said in interviews and letters, her son sometimes
growled ``like a small dog or a wolf.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Wallace offers a glimpse into how difficult it can be to
shake someone out of a delusional universe, even when friends and
relatives notice and want to do something about it. Wallace, like
other rampage killers, was convinced he was defending himself
against an intricate conspiracy. Of the 100 cases in the study, 49
involved killers who had shown extreme, irrational suspicion and
mistrust. In their paranoia, they think they must defend themselves
against threats that other people do not see.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, incarcerated in an isolated Florida prison, Wallace,
38, insists that he had no choice but to open fire in 1997 at a Key
West bar where he once worked, killing one person and injuring
three others.
</P>
<P>
   In a long prison interview, Wallace was unable to deviate from
his convoluted theory that the bar was the center of an
organized-crime drug and prostitution ring with ties _ he was sure
_ to Satanism, President Clinton and Garrison Keillor, host of the
public radio program ``Prairie Home Companion.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace's lawyers argued unsuccessfully that he was insane, but
Wallace insists his actions were perfectly rational.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best example I can give,'' Wallace said, ``is you're in
your house and somebody breaks in and you have to defend yourself
and you end up killing somebody. It's terrible, but what else can
you do?''
</P>
<P>
   From her home in Tennessee, Wallace said she had tried for years
to maneuver her son toward help when he did not want it. ``I was
afraid he was either going to kill himself or he was going to
`fight back' to save himself like a caged animal,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many rampage killers are extremely difficult to treat, say
psychiatrists who have interviewed them. They may deny their
illness and resist medication and treatment, and are often shrewd
about masking symptoms to avoid being hospitalized involuntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who do receive psychiatric treatment do not always
get the help they need.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Brooks Jr. was a policeman's son from Detroit and one of
the few black students to win entrance to both a prestigious local
preparatory school and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Friends in the fraternity house where Brooks lived recall no hint
of anger or illness, only that Brooks was absurdly meticulous about
his chores, and studied so compulsively that they nicknamed him
``Books.'' But in his third year at MIT, he tried to commit
suicide, was hospitalized for obsessive-compulsive disorder, and
later received a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Detroit, living alone, Brooks, 28, sought treatment with
Dr. Reuven Bar-Levav, a well-known local psychiatrist who ran group
therapy sessions in Southfield attended by a close-knit clientele
of upper-middle-class patients coping with depression or anxiety
disorders _ nothing as severe as paranoid schizophrenia. Brooks
joined the group sessions, but refused to take the medication he
had been prescribed, telling friends that the drugs made him
tremble, gain weight and lose concentration.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Rissman, a fellow patient in the therapy group Brooks
joined, said in an interview, ``It was obvious he was not in touch
with reality. He would laugh inappropriately. Within a matter of
two or three group sessions, it became apparent to most of the
senior patients that he did not belong there, that he should have
been institutionalized.''
</P>
<P>
   Rissman said he and several other patients and therapists in the
group practice repeatedly went to Bar-Levav with their concerns
about Brooks. And in one group session _ with Brooks in the room _
a patient named Mary Gregg told the group she was afraid of Brooks,
Rissman recalled.
</P>
<P>
   After about eight group sessions, Bar-Levav finally terminated
Brooks' treatment and referred him to other therapists.
</P>
<P>
   Eight months later, on June 11 last year, Brooks returned to the
psychiatrist's office and killed Bar-Levav. Brooks then pivoted and
fired into the therapy group he had once attended, killing Gregg
and wounding four others, including Rissman, who leapt up to close
the door. Brooks then turned the gun on himself.
</P>
<P>
   Bar-Levav had been given some warning: While in treatment,
Brooks had handed a gun over to another therapist in the practice
and confessed he had come close to killing his girlfriend's mother
and committing suicide. And just before the killings, Brooks sent
Bar-Levav a 52-page manuscript critiquing the therapy he had
received from him. The critique contained obsessive, paranoid
passages about a ``German American woman'' humiliating him in his
therapy group, and hints of menace. The local police emphasized in
interviews with The Times that Bar-Levav should have alerted them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have taken that weapon away from him,'' said Joseph
Thomas, the chief of police in Southfield, a suburn just north of
Detroit. But even had the police confiscated the gun, the killing
would not have been prevented. Brooks easily obtained a second
permit and a second gun _ an expensive limited-edition combat-style
handgun, which he used to kill Bar-Levav.
</P>
<P>
   The psychiatrist's daughter, Dr. Leora Bar-Levav, a therapist
herself who worked with her father and is now carrying on his
practice, rejected with a pained wince the suggestion of
negligence. In a conversation in the practice's new offices in
Southfield, she said the problem was instead a permissive society
and a narcissistic patient who had rejected treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink
it,'' she said. ``Denial is very potent.''

   JAMES DAVIS IN ASHEVILLE, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have it because I probably wouldn't need it much
longer.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Davis, on giving his niece a video game a few days before his
workplace rampage
</P>
<P>
   A man storms a warehouse where he was recently fired, leaving a
trail of shell casings, three dead workers and four more wounded.
The news story the next day begins, ``A disgruntled former employee
went on a shooting rampage.''
</P>
<P>
   In the turmoil that follows a rampage shooting by a killer like
James Davis in Asheville, N.C., there is usually a scramble to
pinpoint the cause. And in a world of rapid news cycles, the
answers come quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was the ``disgruntled employee.'' In the news coverage,
Dung Trinh was so bereaved at the death of his mother that he shot
at nurses last year in a hospital in Anaheim, Calif., where she had
once been treated. Sometimes the reason is reported to be a broken
marriage, a spurned romance or financial misfortune. Mark O.
Barton, a rampage killer in Atlanta, was reported to have singled
out day traders because he had suffered huge losses in the market.
</P>
<P>
   These are the kinds of events that often result in the
observation, ``He just snapped.''
</P>
<P>
   But the action that is often simplistically cited as the cause _
a firing, a divorce, an eviction _ is on closer examination just
the final provocation to a troubled, angry person who has already
left numerous warning markers, often available for many to see.
</P>
<P>
   When he opened fire in the day-trading office, Barton already
had problems deeper than his recent stock losses. Eight hours
earlier, he had killed his second wife and his children, and he was
still the prime suspect in the deaths six years earlier of his
first wife and her mother.
</P>
<P>
   Colin Ferguson, who opened fire on rush-hour commuters on the
Long Island Rail Road, had displayed such menacing behavior that he
received an eviction notice, which further fueled his fury.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the workplace shooters had been fired or disciplined
precisely because they were already threatening violence, behaving
bizarrely or getting in fights. Of the 81 adult murderers The Times
looked at, 49 were unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was no mild-mannered worker who just mysteriously snapped,
according to court records and interviews.
</P>
<P>
   He repeatedly picked fights at the tool warehouse where he
worked in Asheville, and had often told colleagues that if he were
ever fired, he would return to kill his bosses. He had seen combat
in Vietnam and been hospitalized with schizophrenia after the war.
He lived alone, and co-workers knew he owned a .44 magnum with a
scope and had practiced firing it in his basement.
</P>
<P>
   One Wednesday in May 1995, he got into another fight at work,
his last.
</P>
<P>
   That weekend, his family noticed that he was acting strangely.
For example, Davis, an unemotional recluse, told his sister he
loved her. And though James had never given anything to anybody,
his brother, William, later said, James had wanted to give his
niece a chess set and video game the weekend before. His siblings
tried to persuade him to go to a hospital for psychiatric help, but
he refused.
</P>
<P>
   That Monday, James Davis was fired. His bosses were so anxious
about his reaction that they agreed to break the news in a room
where they could use a table to deflect an attack. Some employees
planned escape routes when they heard of Davis' firing.
</P>
<P>
   Just after midnight on Wednesday, William Davis called the
police from his house 100 miles away to tell them that James had
left home in a nervous frenzy and left all his personal belongings
with their mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see why you got to wait till he kills himself or
somebody,'' William Davis told the police, according to a
transcript of his telephone call. ``If you send a patrol car out to
that plant, he's probably sitting there. Or notify them.'' William
Davis told the police, ``I don't know for sure, but I know and
believe by the warning signs he gave me he's going to die.'' The
Asheville police did drive by James Davis' house, but said that
when they saw there was no vehicle in the driveway, there was
nothing else they could do.
</P>
<P>
   William Davis testified that he got in his car around 2 a.m. and
drove to what he thought was his brother's workplace. But because
he had not lived in Asheville for many years, he went to the wrong
plant. The gate was shut, so he drove back to his mother's house to
sleep.
</P>
<P>
   James Davis never came home. That morning, on Wednesday, May 17,
he stormed the Union Butterfield plant. Two of the victims were the
bosses who fired him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live for the rest of my life knowing that if someone had
listened to me, no one would have died,'' William Davis said in an
interview. ``I could have stopped it if someone would have
listened.''
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, with Davis already on death row, a jury considered
a civil suit claiming that his employers had failed to protect the
other employees from a man they knew to be violent. A lawyer for
the company argued there was no way anyone could foresee such an
attack.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the victims said, ``This case is a human tragedy
because this could have been prevented.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury agreed, awarding the families of two of the victims
$7.9 million. An appeal has been filed.

   KIP KINKEL IN SCHOOL IN OREGON
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a horrible son. I wish I had been aborted. I destroy
everything I touch. I can't eat. I can't sleep. I didn't deserve
them. They were wonderful people. It's not their fault or the fault
of any person, organization, or television show. My head just
doesn't work right. God damn these VOICES inside my head.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ From the note Kip Kinkel left on the coffee table in his house
after &QR; 
killing his parents
</P>
<P>
   Even the cases that drew wide attention offer fresh insights
when re-examined in the context of the Times review.
</P>
<P>
   One spring day, Kipland P. Kinkel, a freckle-faced boy with a
history of behavior problems in school, disrupted his ninth-grade
literature class by abruptly yelling out loud, ``God damn this
voice inside my head!''
</P>
<P>
   His teacher took immediate action. He wrote up a disciplinary
note. ``In the future,'' it asked, ``what could you do differently
to prevent this problem?''
</P>
<P>
   Kip dutifully filled out the answer: ``Not to say `Damn'''
</P>
<P>
   The note was signed by the teacher. Kip took it home to his
mother, and she signed it too.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody paid attention to the part about the voice inside Kip's
head.
</P>
<P>
   One month later, on May 20, 1998, Kip was suspended from school
for buying a stolen gun and stashing it in his locker. That
afternoon, back at home in a wooded neighborhood called Shangri La,
Kip Kinkel, 15, shot his father and then his mother.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning he drove to his school in Springfield, Ore.,
and shot 24 people in the cafeteria, killing two students.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes even concerned parents, like the Kinkels, or other
caring adults, find the specter of serious mental or emotional
problems in a child so disturbing that they lapse into denial, the
study found over and over.
</P>
<P>
   The youngsters themselves often unwittingly assist in the denial
by being reluctant to tell someone about hearing voices or having
bizarre thoughts, in fear of being labeled mentally ill.
Complicating the picture is the fact that in adolescents like Kip,
the symptoms are most likely just emerging, psychiatric experts
say.
</P>
<P>
   Kip Kinkel's parents, while perhaps unwilling to face the
serious implications of his outburst in class, had not been blind
to his problems, according to interviews and court records. They
were both schoolteachers, and such behavior would have been hard to
ignore. Starting at age 6, when Kip hit a boy twice his age with a
piece of metal bar, he was susceptible to uncontrollable rages.
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager, like many of the killers in the study, he showed
an inordinate fascination with weapons. He collected knives,
secretly built explosives and boasted to friends that he wanted to
be the next Unabomber. He detonated explosives at a local quarry
and was caught by the police throwing rocks at cars off a highway
overpass, a prank that some psychologists say is an early
indication of a potential for violent tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   His mother took him to a therapist. Kip showed symptoms, the
therapist noted, of ``major depressive disorder,'' and was
prescribed Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   But William Kinkel, Kip's father, did not approve of therapy,
and never attended the sessions, Mark Sabitt, Kip's defense lawyer,
said in an interview. Sabitt said that the senior Kinkel was ``a
very proud individual and aware of his image in the community. He
was very skeptical of counseling in general and closed to the
notion of someone in his family needing treatment, or even worse,
being mentally ill. It just didn't fit with the image he had of his
kids and what he hoped they would be.''
</P>
<P>
   After nine therapy sessions and three months of summer vacation
on Prozac, Kip's behavior improved, so his parents discontinued the
therapy and the medication. Kip's father bought him the Glock
semiautomatic pistol his son had been pestering him for.
</P>
<P>
   At Kip's sentencing hearing, the defense presented a family tree
showing severe mental illness, including schizophrenia, affecting
three generations on both the maternal and paternal sides.
</P>
<P>
   When Kip's victims addressed the judge, some said he was faking
insanity. Others said that even if insane, he should be held
responsible for ripping apart their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if you're sick, if you're insane, if you're
crazy,'' said Jacob Ryker, one of the students who finally tackled
Kip, despite gunshot wounds in his own chest and arm. ``I don't
care. I think prison, a lifetime in prison is too good for you. If
a dog was to go insane and if a dog got rabid and it bit someone,
you destroy it. So I stand here and I ask, why haven't you been
destroyed? I question myself for not pulling the trigger.''

   SGT. WILLIAM KREUTZER JR. AT FORT BRAGG, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to go. I'm loading magazines.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Kreutzer, in his last telephone call to a squadmate
</P>
<P>
   An agitated Sgt. William Kreutzer Jr. telephoned a friend in his
squad at Fort Bragg, N.C. He said the shooting would begin the next
morning at daybreak, just when 1,300 soldiers were on a field
stretching before their morning run.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he was going to `mow them down,''' said his friend,
Spc. Burl F. Mays.
</P>
<P>
   True, Kreutzer was an odd loner who talked about killing so
often that the men in his company had nicknamed him Crazy Kreutzer
and Silence of the Lambs. But when Mays arrived early the next
morning and saw Kreutzer was not in, he feared that this time it
was no idle threat. He told his superiors just before 5 a.m. and
was asked to check Kreutzer's room.
</P>
<P>
   He found that the bed had not been slept in. On the desk he
found a draft of Kreutzer's will.
</P>
<P>
   Mays later testified that when he then tried to alarm superiors,
the first sergeant dismissed his concerns, saying something like,
``Kreutzer is a pussy, he wouldn't do anything like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The case of Kreutzer, told in court records and interviews,
illustrates an altogether different common case: the depressed and
angry misfit provoked by the people around him.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Park Elliott Dietz, a psychiatrist and expert on mass
killers, said people who became mass murderers were often ``handled
in a provocative, ineffective way.'' Their outrageous fantasies of
violence draw public condemnation or ridicule. Humiliation, Dietz
said, often precedes rampage killing.
</P>
<P>
   Kreutzer, a gawky perfectionist, had long been the object of
ridicule in his squad at Fort Bragg. When his unit was sent to the
Sinai, other soldiers tied his shoelaces together while he slept.
They filled his boots with sand. Kreutzer, 26, had always wanted to
be a soldier, but he lagged behind on company runs and sometimes
misplaced equipment. He cried when criticized. When he repeatedly
threatened to kill other soldiers, they took it as a joke.

<P>
   Fifteen months before his final ambush, when Kreutzer had an
outburst in which he threatened to kill soldiers and it became
common knowledge, his superiors sent him to a military social
worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me that he had specific plans to kill the people in
his squad,'' the counselor, Darren Fong, told military
investigators, the court-martial documents show. But when he was
returned to full duty, Kreutzer was not referred to Army
psychiatrists. He was barred from access to weapons for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The morning of Oct. 27, 1995, Kreutzer hid in the woods and
fired onto a field of American soldiers. He wounded 18 of them, and
killed Maj. Stephen Mark Badger, an intelligence officer and a
father and stepfather of eight children.
</P>
<P>
   Kreutzer kept firing until he was tackled from behind by two
comrades.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, he spoke to a military police officer, Bruce W.
Hamrick.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he kept warning people that he was going to kill
somebody,'' Hamrick testified, ``but that nobody would listen.''

MUSEEUW WINS 2 YEARS AFTER ALMOST LOSING A LEG 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROUBAIX, France _ The king of the classics reclaimed his throne
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after he fractured his left knee in the Paris-Roubaix
race and nearly lost the leg to gangrene, Johan Museeuw, 34, of
Belgium returned to that race and won it after a long, solitary
ride. It was his 10th career victory in one-day classics and his
first since the accident.
</P>
<P>
   As he neared the finish line in the velodrome in Roubaix alone,
Museeuw blew a kiss to the heavens and then clapped his hands. Just
across the line, he suddenly lifted his left leg from the pedal,
thrust it outright and pointed to the knee.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to miss his point.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the race where, two years ago, I thought my career was
over,'' Museeuw, the leader of the Mapei team, said afterward.
Referring to his 33rd-place finish in the Tour of Flanders in his
backyard last Sunday, Museeuw added, ``This second victory in
Paris-Roubaix means more to me than a fourth victory in the Tour of
Flanders would have.''
</P>
<P>
   He won Paris-Roubaix, a 273-kilometer (170-mile) jaunt over
nearly 50 kilometers of cobblestones, for the first time in 1996
with teammates second and third close behind him. This time Museeuw
did it all himself, joining an attack by Frankie Andreu of the
United States Postal Service team with just over 50 kilometers to
go. He left Andreu behind 10 kilometers farther on and then held
off what was left of the 176-man field. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With 30 kilometers and five of the 25 cobblestone sections over
back-country roads to go, Museeuw built a lead that reached 2
minutes 40 seconds. Thereafter, as he bounced along or shifted from
side to side of the road to find a trail of tar, the lead began to
come down.
</P>
<P>
   He was still 1:55 up with 17 kilometers left when he began
losing some steam. Behind him, a handful of pursuers linked up and
began working together, taking turns at the front to set a pace
faster than Museeuw's solo effort.
</P>
<P>
   With 11 kilometers to go, the lead had dropped to 1:20, and with
5 kilometers to go, it was 1:05. As the kilometers clicked off on
the long straightaway to the Roubaix velodrome, his advantage
clicked off too: 56 seconds at the four-kilometer mark, 45 seconds
at the three-kilometer mark, 36 seconds at the two-kilometer mark.
</P>
<P>
   Periodically, Museeuw turned back to see where the pursuit was _
often the sign of a tiring or not confident rider. He was still
turning his head as he passed the red triangle that signifies the
final kilometer and even once he reached the track. Finally there
were no more doubts, and he stared only ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Museeuw finished 15 seconds ahead of Peter Van Petegem, a
Belgian with the Farm Frites team, with Erik Zabel, a German with
Telekom, third; Tristan Hoffman, a Dutchman with Memorycard,
fourth; and Stafano Zanini, an Italian with Mapei, fifth. They were
all in the same time as Van Petegem.
</P>
<P>
   Museeuw was clocked in 6 hours 47 minutes, an average speed of
40 kilometers an hour _ about 25 miles an hour _ for the race in
cool, dry weather with brisk winds.
</P>
<P>
   This was the fifth victory in six years for Mapei in
Paris-Roubaix but just its first victory in 3 of the 10 World Cup
classics so far this season. When a sponsor spends $10 million a
year on a 39-rider squad, as Mapei does _ both figures are double
those of most other teams _ it expects results, and Museeuw's
comeback Sunday qualifies.
</P>
<P>
   Another team, with a far smaller budget, also did well. That was
the United States Postal Service, which recorded a 6th place by a
surging George Hincapie, an American; 16th by Slava Ekimov, a
Russian; and 20th by Andreu, another American.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-nine of the 176 starters finished as punctures and
crashes on the cobblestones took their usual toll. As one of the
dropouts, Oleg Kozlitinne, a Kazakh with the St. Quentin-Oktos
team, said as he toweled himself dry partway through, ``You get a
flat and have to wait two or three minutes for a new wheel, it's
all over.'' &QL;

METS' FRANCO TRYING TO DEAL WITH HIS DIMINISHED ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CURRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John Franco emerged from the athletic trainer's room
Sunday, spotted a few reporters who wanted to ask him about his
Saturday afternoon fiasco and feigned running from them. Franco
laughed at his own joke and casually walked into the middle of the
Mets' clubhouse, right toward reporters and the probing questions
that might hound him all season.
</P>
<P>
   One horrible game will cause this, and even Franco had to
concede that he was awful while permitting the Dodgers two homers
and four runs in the ninth inning. Franco turned a 5-1 lead and
what would have been a special victory for so many reasons into a
tie score and the Mets eventually succumbed, 6-5, in 10 innings
when Armando Benitez stumbled. A day later, Franco tried chuckling
over his failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting some work done on my neck,'' said Franco, whose
neck glistened with a pain-relieving ointment. Then Franco snapped
his neck back once and then twice, reminding everyone how helpless
he looked while watching two homers soar out of Shea Stadium.
Everyone laughed, but no one needed a reminder.
</P>
<P>
   The day after a reliever mishandles a potential victory can be
unpleasant. Franco knows this routine because he has saved 416
games and botched 91, but the routine is a bit different for him
this season. Franco is not the closer anymore. Benitez is and,
while Franco is shrewd enough not to grouse publicly, it bothers
him that he is not closing and it bothers him when the Mets fans
treat him like he is wearing a John Rocker mask.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the beginning of every season since 1986, Franco does not
know when he will get anywhere near the mound in the ninth again.
Franco wanted to pitch Sunday and erase the stale taste of defeat,
but the snow interfered and the Mets-Dodgers game was postponed. So
Franco waits, the wounds from Saturday still fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough night,'' Franco said, his comedy routine
finished.
</P>
<P>
   Once the one-liners fade, Franco's body language is the body
language of a proud pitcher who has always been doubted and who
feels like that has happened again. Franco was hesitant to even
call himself a setup man in spring training, perhaps believing that
he would eventually get the chance to pitch the ninth. Manager
Bobby Valentine gave Franco the chance in the seventh game and
should not do it again soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one part of a long season,'' Franco said.
</P>
<P>
   Or is it something more? Franco did not complain about his
diminished role and admonished himself for two poorly located
fastballs. Eric Karros drilled a high fastball for a homer and
Devon White's game-tying shot came off a fastball that caught too
much of the outside corner. For Franco, who cannot simply rely on
fastballs, the adjustment period is ongoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the eighth inning has got to be like my save situation,''
Franco said. ``Or whenever I'm called upon, seventh, eighth, ninth
inning. I got to make the best of it.''
</P>
<P>
   When someone talks about making the best of a situation, it
usually means they are dealing with something that does not
enthrall them. That is the perfect way to describe Franco's
situation. After flirting with asking the Mets to trade him in the
off-season, Franco decided to stay. It made sense because Franco
had reached the postseason for the first time in his 16-year career
with the Reds and Mets, and there was no guarantee he would close
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But Franco has to accept his setup role. With his slider,
changeup and sinking fastball, Franco can be an effective counter
in the eighth to Benitez's fastball in the ninth. Franco admitted
it was possible his ``concentration level wasn't where it should
be,'' on Saturday, a surprising admission.
</P>
<P>
   The ninth is still the ninth, whether a team is leading by one
run or four runs. If Franco had a concentration problem, that is a
problem for the Mets and a problem he must overcome. Could Franco
be unnerved by the fans who booed him almost as soon as he jogged
in from the bullpen?
</P>
<P>
   ``The skin has got to stay thick,'' said Franco, who allowed
more homers on Saturday than the one he gave up in 402/3 innings
last season.
</P>
<P>
   Someone asked him if his skin gets thicker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like alligator,'' Franco said. ``It's got to. You really don't
know how to describe it unless you're there on the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   Franco might be the symbol for the successful native New York
athlete who plays for a New York team and is loathed, not loved.
Mark Jackson was booed as a Knick, but no one has been vilified as
consistently as Franco. Some of it is deserved since his efforts
can decide games. Some of it is not.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Franco, who often dances around questions about
the abuse, did not tango when asked if he thinks some fans want him
to falter. That sounds incongruous. Fans want teams to succeed, no
matter who contributes. But Franco said it is plausible that some
fans want him to flop, which reveals a lot about his thoughts and
about how complicated this season could get for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like it,'' Franco said. ``It's kind of mind-boggling.
I tried figuring that out a long time ago, and then I just gave up.
I'm not going to worry about it.'' &QL;
</P>

SCHUMACHER EDGES HAKKINEN BY 1.1 SECONDS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BRAD SPURGEON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   IMOLA, Italy _ Michael Schumacher finally got his chance to race
Mika Hakkinen to the finish line, and Schumacher came out on top.
He won a tense battle to the last second Sunday in the San Marino
Grand Prix. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before 115,000 ecstatic Italian fans at his team's home race,
Schumacher drove his Ferrari over the 62 laps and nearly 190 miles
at an average speed of 124.247 miles an hour. Hakkinen followed
only 1.1 seconds behind, while David Coulthard, in the other
McLaren-Mercedes, finished third, 49.8 seconds back. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was Schumacher's third straight victory this year, his second
straight at Imola and the 38th of his career. It was also his third
at Imola, where he won in 1994 driving a Benetton, and last year in
a Ferrari, in the first victory for Ferrari at Imola since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher increased his total in the drivers' standing to a
perfect 30 points for three races, 21 ahead of his teammate, Rubens
Barrichello, who finished the race in fourth.
</P>
<P>
   But Schumacher's real victory was that Hakkinen, who won the
last two world championships and is still considered his biggest
threat, has only 6 points after three races.
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher has said repeatedly in recent weeks that he wanted a
showdown on the track against the McLaren cars after Hakkinen's car
fell out of the first two races with technical breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what we wanted to do,'' Schumacher said. ``I said after
the first two races that I wanted to race the McLarens, to see
where we are. And now we know where we are. We won the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher began from second place on the grid, but got off to a
bad start as his wheels spun. That allowed Hakkinen, who was on the
pole position, to take off comfortably in first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the worst ones,'' Schumacher said of his start.
``It was a bungled start. I was lucky that nobody went by, except
Mika, so that I could drive my race.''
</P>
<P>
   Pit-stop strategy was a deciding factor.
</P>
<P>
   Both drivers pulled in for their first stop on Lap 27, and the
duel was won by McLaren, as Hakkinen stopped in 7.6 seconds, while
Schumacher stopped in 9.9 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   So Ferrari tried a different strategy for the second stop and
did not pit when Hakkinen did. On Lap 44 Hakkinen stopped in 8.3
seconds, while Schumacher stepped on the accelerator to gain time
without Hakkinen on the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``The four laps before the second stop was the decisive moment
when I pushed very hard,'' Schumacher said.
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher stopped on Lap 48, the last of the top six cars to do
so. He returned to the track after just 6.2 seconds, just ahead of
Jarno Trulli's Jordan car, which was in seventh place and blocking
Hakkinen.
</P>
<P>
   All around the track the Italian fans leaped to their feet and
waved their flags as Schumacher came out in the lead. He had a
3.7-second gap on Hakkinen, but there were 14 laps left and
Hakkinen was catching up fast.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic, however, held Hakkinen up and he could not catch
Schumacher. Despite the frequent waving of blue flags by officials
to tell cars to let him pass, Hakkinen was blocked more than once.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are about 20 years old, those blue flags,'' he
said, ``And they are not so blue anymore. So I suppose it's a bit
difficult to see them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hakkinen also said he had run into a metal object on the track,
which he said damaged his car and caused him to go slower. He also
said he lost three or four seconds when his engine cut out at one
point. &QL;

IN THE HEART OF GEEK COUNTRY, SEXES MEET AT STRIKEOUT.COM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., N.Y.)   By EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ It was getting too late to meet a geek.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd at Nola's, a bar six deep with techies not an hour
before, had thinned to little clusters of buddies fixated on the
Sports Channel. Debbie Giacomo and her three friends, perched on
too-tall stools around a table, felt wasted, and not from their
warm Anchor Steam pale ales.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are we doing here alone?'' said Giacomo, a 31-year-old
third-grade teacher in nearby Hayward, surveying the remaining,
idling men. ``We're young. We're cute. We're available. So what are
we doing here alone?''
</P>
<P>
   A good question. This, after all, is the heart of the heart of
man country, one of the few places in the Western Hemisphere where
men outnumber women.
</P>
<P>
   Palo Alto, arguably the center of the Silicon Valley universe,
has a whopping 36 percent more men than women. Sometimes, the
troops of men strolling around downtown makes it seems like a Boy
Scout reunion is in town. And since this is also the land of the
best educated, highest paid workers in the world, minting 64 new
millionaires a day, single women in search of smart, successful men
should be having a ball.
</P>
<P>
   But the valley is a weird world, unto itself. In this sphere,
techies take their dogs, birds and pajamas to work, and being too
busy for anything but becoming the next MOP (millionaire on paper)
is as crucial to fitting in as Palm organizers and T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday nights, Fry's Electronics, the techie haven here, is
more packed with single men than the trendy bars, which tend to
fill with Stanford students. So while the geek glut has spawned an
industry of matchmakers and image consultants _ thse who teach men
everything from how long their pants should be to how to say hello
_ finding romance is harder than finding a house here for under
half a million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Matchmakers say the dating scene is probably worse than
anywhere. ``It's pretty brutal,'' said Julie Paiva, president of
Table for Six Total Adventures and Entertainment, a meeting service
and social club that began in San Francisco in 1997 and branched
out to Silicon Valley's Mountain View last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't have a lot of time,'' Paiva said.
``There's a lot of stress on their lives. It's very, very
competitive. Everyone is worried that the other guy is moving
faster. I've never seen such competitive people in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   No one, if the anecdotal evidence gathered from single men and
women in bars and on the street can be trusted, is happy. Everyone
complains. The men complain that the women are too few and too hard
to get; the women, that the men don't bother with them or even know
how to try.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wherever you go, the ratio is five to one, men to women,''
said Jim Aronson, a 30-year-old sales representative for a
semiconductor company in San Jose, as he crankily surveyed the
scene in Nola's the other night. Actually, the ratio looked more
like 60-40, but all he could see, he said, were ``guys, and more
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The girls know they have the pick of the litter,'' Aronson
said. ``And there's a lot of gold diggers out there. They come
around just to play who wants to meet a millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, an urban legend is growing in Silicon Valley about women
flocking here in search of geek gods with all the right assets, at
least on paper. But like Big Foot, such tales, told by disgruntled
single men, are hard to prove. At Nola's, the women come from only
as far as other parts of Silicon Valley, same as the men. Danette
Austin, a 33-year-old kindergarten teacher in Campbell, next door
to San Jose, was not even sure the hype about a guy glut was true.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say that the ratio is so good here,'' Austin said. ``But
the good guys that are available don't come out of their
cubicles.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, she said, a bar has never been the ideal way to meet
a mate, or even a date. ``I had one good relationship come out of
meeting someone at a bar,'' she said. ``But I don't know where to
meet anyone anymore. I work really hard, really long hours, and I'm
really busy. I've gone years without seeing someone or having a
date. It's crazy.''

<P>
   It's not as if opportunities to meet The One, or The One in the
Meantime, are lacking. It's hard to read a newspaper without coming
across ads for yet another dating service. Consultants like Jama
Clark in San Francisco, who offers a six-week course on ``The Art
of Meeting Women,'' are busier than some stock-optioned CEOs. (One
of her tips: ``The first gatekeeper to sexual attraction is the way
you look.'')
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the parties. Lots and lots of parties. It's
becoming a tradition for every new start-up to hold a launch party
in San Francisco, usually with an open bar and open door. Indeed,
one Web site, www.sfgirl.com, which lists every techie party in
town, often lists two or three on the same night.
</P>
<P>
   The dot camaraderie is as thick as the sweaty, crushed crowds at
these events. But the action in such parties is all about
networking, not dating, the regulars say. Dates, when made, tend to
be lavish: at the most expensive restaurants, or on yachts, across
borders on private planes, even across the ocean. But dates seem to
be the exception.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Gioffree, a 31-year-old sales representative for computer
hardware and software to dentists, said neither he nor his friends
had ever met women they might date. ``The ratio is not good,''
Gioffree said. ``I travel a lot, and wherever I go, it's quite
different. Plus the women are quite stuck up here.''
</P>
<P>
   If dating is bad for most singles here, it's even worse for
those who happen not to fit the prevailing demographics _ white and
young, between 22 and 35. Maxeau Mercier, a 30-year-old systems
engineer from Montreal, who is black, has had a very dry spell,
dating-wise, since moving to Sunnyvale three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work 50 to 70 hours a week anyway,'' Mercier said, watching
three women semisurrounded by a dozen men at Q's, another popular
gathering spot in downtown Palo Alto. There are few women in his
company, he said, so the corporate gym and the corporate cafeteria
and the corporate water cooler are out. And so are clubs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't ever see a girl here that I'm attracted to,'' he said.
``So I think, `What's the point?' When you meet them and you tell
them what you do, they assume right away that you make a lot of
money.''
</P>
<P>
   In another world, say, the Upper West Side of Manhattan, which
is heavy with single women, Craig Newmark, a 47-year-old
self-described ``George Costanza, formerly classic nerd type,''
would be a catch.
</P>
<P>
   Newmark, founder and chief executive of craigslist, a popular
community service Web site in San Francisco, is witty (asked the
contents of his refrigerator, he says, ``don't ask, don't tell''),
civic-minded (his Web site is partly nonprofit) and utterly
available (``I'm open to all possibilities'').
</P>
<P>
   Though listed on the Web site www.women.com as one of Silicon
Valley's 10 most eligible bachelors, Newmark has had little action
in the date department. The only eligible bachelor on the site who
is over 40, and overweight, he has received about two dozen e-mail
messages over several weeks and has answered every one. But only
one turned into a date _ a first and last date.
</P>
<P>
   ``Online chemistry, even voice,'' he said, ``often does not
translate into physical chemistry.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Paiva, of Table for Six Total Adventures and
Entertainment, which arranges dinner dates with three women and
three men with similar interests, said one of the big problems in
Silicon Valley these days was that the women were too picky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's kind of unfair what they're saying about the men
_ that they're geeks who don't have social graces,'' she said. ``I
think the ideal man is still the Harrison Ford-Indiana Jones type.
The women will say, `I don't want to meet anyone who is bald.'
Well, that bald man might be their soul mate.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``I've been a relationship coach 10 years, and I've
never seen things so bad. The misunderstanding between the sexes is
tremendous. The women are very tough on the men. They're constantly
finding reasons to not like them. And the men, who are some of the
nicest guys in the world, think that women just don't want nice
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the women think there are not too many nice guys
around, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   At Nola's, one of Danette Austin's friends, Katie (who wanted
only her first name used), decided to test her theory that all men
want to do is brag about how much they make. She pointed to a
clean-cut, well-pressed young man of about her age, 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just watch,'' she said. ``I'm going over to that guy and in
five minutes I'll tell you what he makes.''
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes later, she was back. ``A hundred thou,'' she said
with a shrug. ``In sales. He said he'll do a lot better next
year.''
</P>
<P>
   She didn't hear what the gentleman, Bob Cruz of San Jose, said
about her afterward. ``A pure gold digger,'' Cruz summed up. ``Just
like most of them.''

EPIDEMIC OF CATTLE DISEASE INFLICTS TOLL ON SOUTH KOREA 
</HEADLINE>
   By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUMPARI, South Korea _ In this region of machine gunners'
trenches and foxholes hard by the border with North Korea, the
roadblocks manned by grim-faced soldiers in camouflage-painted
trucks give every appearance of preparation for an imminent
invasion.
</P>
<P>
   For all of the military presence, the vigilance has nothing to
do with war. As the reeking blankets drenched with germ-killing
chlorine and stretched across feeder roads in this farmland make
clear, the enemy in this case is an infectious outbreak that has
taken on all the seriousness of a national emergency.
</P>
<P>
   The threat that has gripped South Korea in the last three weeks
is foot-and-mouth disease, one of the most destructive cattle
diseases known. And with critical national elections set for this
week, the government has pulled out all the stops to limit the
damage _ not only to agriculture, but to its political support as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Since the outbreak of this extremely contagious viral disease
was confirmed last week, upsetting livestock markets throughout the
Far East, South Korea has taken increasingly muscular measures to
prevent a spreading epidemic from becoming the story of this week's
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Foot-and-mouth disease causes blisters with an infectious
discharge in the mouths and on the extremities of cattle and pigs,
provoking loss of appetite, high fevers, and ultimately death _
often to entire herds. Humans seldom contract the disease, though
they may be carriers.
</P>
<P>
   The last time a confirmed outbreak of the disease occurred in
the region, in Taiwan in 1977, it forced authorities to slaughter
over 3 million pigs, nearly devastating a $1.5 billion industry.
Fearing an outbreak on that scale, and perhaps a wildfire-like
spread throughout the region, China, Taiwan, Australia and Japan
have all quickly imposed bans on beef and pork imports from South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The country's pork exports to Japan, its major customer, are
worth an estimated $400 million annually. Japan has also reported a
small number of confirmed cases of the disease in Miyazaki
prefecture since mid-March and so far has destroyed at least 19
cattle.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to calling the army to enforce quarantines, the
South Korean government's anti-epidemic measures so far have
included closing more than 130 livestock markets, banning sales of
meat and milk in affected areas, destroying about 500 cattle and
vaccinating 300,000 others.
</P>
<P>
   The mobilization is such that for vehicles entering and leaving
this Paju Valley region of wide swaths of rich, river-irrigated
farmland ringed by high mountains, 35 miles north of Seoul, there
is an obligatory wash with disinfectants.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point I think it has been reduced to a very sporadic
problem,'' said Bong Kyun-park, a swine virologist at Seoul
National University who has advised the government throughout the
crisis. ``We have found only ten confirmed cases in the entire
country. This involves only four sites, and we are very excited
about its confinement.''
</P>
<P>
   Park and other officials involved in the containment effort may
be excited, but the country's livestock farmers share none of this
enthusiasm. In fact, in the last few days their reaction to a ban
on the trade in animals, milk, cattle and pork products has turned
increasingly angry.
</P>
<P>
   Furious farmers rioted at roadblocks on the approaches to the
capital on Saturday, demanding that they either be allowed to sell
their products or be reimbursed at full value. Opposition parties
have sought to portray the government as unprepared for an
epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we are worried,'' said Myoung Soon-im, a 61-year-old
rancher whose face is deeply etched by years of working in the
fields. ``We can't even sell our milk. We have no idea what to
expect next, and don't know what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Although his farm stands on high ground less than two miles from
the site of the initial outbreak, he said, his cows had been
vaccinated by visiting government teams, and had so far shown no
signs of illness.
</P>
<P>
   While the government has worked aggressively to contain the
outbreak, conversations with farmers suggested that little effort
had been spent on education about the disease or how to prevent its
spread.
</P>
<P>
   The government has told farmers to try to keep their cattle in
barns, or otherwise shielded from the yellow smog that hangs over
South Korea this time of year, and which has been especially heavy
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The yellowish tinge is widely believed to come from dust blown
in from the Gobi Desert, in China, and the strong suggestion in
those messages seems to be that the infection may have somehow
drifted in from afar, as well.
</P>
<P>
   As the old rancher spoke, at the edge of the corral where his 30
milk cows fed, his wife rushed out of their manure-filled barn to
shoo away visitors, telling them that the government had sternly
warned farmers not to talk about the outbreak to outsiders _ and
especially not to journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know anything about this disease,'' she said. ``What
we know is that when there are visitors there is more trouble.
Please go away.''

SHEFFIELD WORRIED ABOUT INJURY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK - Gary Sheffield walked into the Dodgers clubhouse
Sunday with the aid of crutches, placed them into his locker and
then hobbled into the trainer's room.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers' left fielder said it's too early to tell how
long his sprained right ankle would keep him out of the lineup.
Sheffield also said he wasn't sure whether he's heading for the
disabled list or whether he'll be back in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't seem too optimistic,'' Sheffield said. ``If some
miracle is going to happen, I'll play. But I'm not optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield suffered the high ankle sprain in the first inning of
the Dodgers' 6-5 win in 10 innings Saturday against the Mets. His
availability was supposed to become more clear Sunday, but the
Dodgers will give it another day and evaluate him today in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers officials are hopeful Sheffield will be able to play
during the three-game series. Sheffield is concerned about the
injury because of what happened with the Angels' Mo Vaughn when he
suffered a similar injury last season. And the Dodgers,
understanding Sheffield's value, won't allow him to play before
he's ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be right when I get out there,'' Sheffield. ``I'm
going to talk to (Vaughn) and find out what he did to get back. Mo
Vaughn, he's more of a back leg hitter than I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Snowed in: Sunday's game with the Mets was canceled at 10:30
a.m., but that didn't help the Dodgers get out of New York any
faster. The plane they chartered wasn't due into New York until
late afternoon, so the bus couldn't leave for the airport until
4:45 p.m., which made for lots of chess and card games in the
clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Also, manager Davey Johnson wasn't too pleased about having to
play the makeup on Monday, April 24, at 7:10 p.m. The Dodgers were
supposed to have an off day between series in Cincinnati and
Atlanta, but that's apparently out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not real fond of it,'' Johnson said. ``I'd rather come
back later on when the weather is nicer, but it's not my call.''
</P>
<P>
   What's with the ball: The San Francisco Giants were going to
help christen their new ballpark by using the last ball pitched at
Candlestick Park in the first-pitch ceremonies at Pac Bell Park on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But alas, the ball remains in Eric Karros' possession, where
it's been since the Dodgers and Giants closed out the 'Stick last
September.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in my closet in a plastic bag with a little notecard that
says, `Last ball used at Candlestick-3Com, Marvin Bernard-ground
ball' '' Karros said. ``That's so I remember what it is. I got it
sitting in there. I'm just curious to see if they throw out the
first ball. That's what I heard, but I don't know if that's going
to happen. Nobody's ever asked me about it, and I heard the
previous trainer from that ballclub presented their owner with the
ball. I read about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Herges' reprieve: When the Dodgers optioned lefty Carlos Perez
to Triple-A Albuquerque on Friday, it meant right-hander Matt
Herges continued his amazing survival tactics and will be with the
club at least for another week. But it took some reassurances when
he got to the ballpark Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got back to my room and I had a fax waiting for me,'' Herges
said. ``I called down and they had somebody bring it to me. It was
an itinerary to go to New Orleans (Saturday) at 2:45 p.m. Whew! I
didn't sleep much. I got to the park, my uniform was still in the
locker, so I asked somebody and they said I'm still here.''
</P>
<P>
   The original plan was for Herges to join Albuquerque on its
season-opening road trip so outfielder Geronimo Berroa could come
to New York. But after Perez bombed in his start Thursday at
Montreal, plans changed. It also helps that Herges hasn't allowed a
hit in four innings this season.

 &HT;    Martin's `worst' enough
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARTINSVILLE, Va. _ The Roush gang stole the show Sunday at
Martinsville Speedway and then gleefully turned themselves in.
</P>
<P>
   Stuck back in the pack and admittedly ``the worst driver here
and I know it,'' Mark Martin took the lead with 64 laps remaining
and held on to win the Goody's Body Pain 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stole this thing,'' Martin said. ``That's how I feel. I
thought I had a 15th-place car, maybe 10th. I was leading, I ran
hard and nobody came (to challenge). I just ran like a mean dog.
Right now, this feels like the biggest win of my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin beat Roush teammate Jeff Burton's Ford by 1.505 seconds.
It was an afternoon of comebacks for Burton, who had fallen to 37th
place after being penalized for leaving pit road before receiving
the signal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel me finishing second today is a borderline felony,''
Burton said. ``We might need to spend a few hours in jail before we
go home. We didn't deserve to finish second. Today's as bad as
we've ever run.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first win of the 2000 Winston Cup season for Martin,
the only driver among the top five points leaders without a victory
before Sunday. He remains second in points but climbed within 36 of
leader Bobby Labonte, who finished 12th.
</P>
<P>
   Martin also is the eighth different winning driver at the start
of the season, a NASCAR record. The all-time overall record is 13
consecutive different winners, set in 1961; the modern era record
is 11 straight different winners in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Martin and Burton were among the survivors of an event-record 17
cautions for 112 laps that slowed the average speed to 71.161 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Martin maintained his lead through the last three restarts.
Rusty Wallace had the dominant car, leading for 343 laps, but
changes to his No. 2 Ford over the last 64 laps took it out of
contention. The yellow flags began flying from the third lap, when
Kenny Wallace, who started on the outside pole, had a stuck
throttle and drove into the wall at Turn 3.
</P>
<P>
   And they were flying as late as lap 489, when Michael Waltrip's
car knocked out Michael Andretti in Turn 2.
</P>
<P>
   Martin won the race in one moment of brilliance. Crew chief
Jimmy Fennig told him to stay out on lap 437 when the leaders,
including Wallace, pitted.
</P>
<P>
   Martin had pitted, without much company, on lap 411. ``I called
it and Jimmy (agreed),'' he said. ``I thought it was time to do it
and then I questioned it when the leaders didn't come (in). He
said, `You come.' So we did, and that's how it went.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin took home $104,650 and the grandfather clock the Speedway
awards the winner. ``My wife,'' he said, ``has nagged me about one
of those grandfather clocks for 10 years.''

YUGOSLAV WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL IN THE HAGUE GAINS NEW MOMENTUM 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARLISE SIMONS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands _ Confounding the many critics who long
called the international tribunal here a mere fig leaf for Western
shame, the court dealing with Yugoslav war crimes has just
completed an extraordinary month.
</P>
<P>
   It has opened the first U.N. trial ever to focus exclusively on
sexual violence against women, including gang rape and the use of
women as sexual slaves as part of a war strategy.
</P>
<P>
   It has begun the trial of one of the top generals alleged to be
responsible for the carnage in 1995 at the Bosnian town of
Srebrenica, probably Europe's worst massacre of civilians since
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   And on Friday, prosecutors brought before the court a top
Bosnian Serb political leader who is charged with complicity in the
genocide that the prosecutors say his people perpetrated against
Bosnia's Muslims and Croats, but who not so long ago was accepted
as a figure who could meet with Western presidents and prime
ministers.
</P>
<P>
   While problems remain, and the recent momentum is the result of
slow shifts by Western governments and tribunal prosecutors
themselves, the changes have engendered a rare sense of excitement
in the sober high-security building on the outskirts of this Dutch
city where judges are quietly testing and defining uncharted
international laws.
</P>
<P>
   Usually the building feels more like a subdued hospital for the
Balkan heart, a place that tries to put patches on the wrenching
pain of witnesses while lawyers haggle over legal remedies.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, which began with the capture of Momcilo Krajisnik
(pronounced mohm-chee-loh cry-ish-nik), the senior Bosnian Serb
politician who was brought before the court on Friday, seemed to
galvanize both staff members and visitors. He is the
highest-ranking Serb in the tribunal's custody.
</P>
<P>
   ``The momentum and the energy at the tribunal have been
amazing,'' said Heather Ryan of the Coalition for International
Justice, who has monitored proceedings on behalf of several human
rights groups for almost two years. ``I've not seen so much
substance at any one time, at least in the public arena. The
tribunal seems to have hit a new stride.''
</P>
<P>
   For Krajisnik's first appearance, at which he pleaded not guilty
to all nine counts against him, the usually empty public gallery
overflowed and hundreds crowded the lobby to follow the event on
television monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Other courtrooms here heard testimony of great moment. U.N.
peacekeepers gave the most vivid accounts yet of the tense days in
July 1995 around Srebrenica that led up to the alleged massacre by
Serbs of perhaps 8,000 Muslim men.
</P>
<P>
   Two Dutch peacekeepers at the trial of Gen. Radislav Krstic, one
of the Bosnian Serb commanders at Srebrenica, for the first time
publicly testified that even before the peacekeepers' forced
departure, there had been blatant signs of impending slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Dutch soldiers, Paul Groenewegen, detained by the
Serbs at the time, said he believed that executions had been going
on, as he heard repeated single gunshots for a whole day, ``perhaps
20 to 40 shots'' per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Stoelinga, another Dutch soldier, said he had seen clothes
and shoes piled by the roadside and a truck loaded with blue and
bloated bodies. ``It's a smell I won't forget,'' he told the court
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Those accounts are significant because they differ widely from
past tribunal testimony by the Dutch commander, Lt. Col. Ton
Karremans, who said that while the peacekeepers had no choice but
to hand over the civilians under their protection, they had no
reason to suspect the coming executions of the Muslim men.
</P>
<P>
   Such details have long been known inside the Dutch government,
but their disclosure has shocked the Dutch public. Politicians and
newspaper editorial writers have demanded a parliamentary inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The drama now going on at the the tribunal, with young women
sobbing as they speak of gang rape and senior political and
military war leaders standing in the dock, can also be followed by
more people in the Balkans, for whom these trials are most
intended.
</P>
<P>
   The new South East News Service for Europe, financed mainly by
the European Union, has begun to broadcast regular live television
and radio programs and summaries from the trials, allowing people
in Montenegro, Bosnia and parts of Serbia and Croatia to follow the
tribunal's many activities.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors have contributed to the tribunal's new momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Western governments, which long appeared to pay only lip service
to the court, lauding its objectives but starving it of funds and
intelligence, now find it more politically convenient to have their
soldiers arrest important suspects, like camp commanders and
Bosnian Serb and Croat generals.
</P>
<P>
   British troops were the first, after the election of a Labor
government in 1997 that succeeded the Conservatives who were in
power during the 1991-95 wars in Croatia and Bosnia. American,
Dutch and German soldiers followed.
</P>
<P>
   Court investigators, whose work has often been painfully slow,
have also managed to speed up indictments as their body of evidence
grew and cases began to overlap. A third courtroom that was added
in late 1998 has helped.
</P>
<P>
   But it took public complaints from Louise Arbour, the former
chief prosecutor, for NATO countries to release more intelligence
and to use peacekeepers to seize key documents in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that Carla del Ponte, the former attorney general of
Switzerland who took over as chief prosecutor last fall, has now
pressed France into greater action.
</P>
<P>
   French troops were seen as providing a de facto safe-haven for
key suspects in their sector of Bosnia, which covers much of the
Bosnian Serbs' republic in the eastern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Del Ponte, who gained a record for toughness as a prosecutor
fighting organized crime, in January called on the defense and
foreign ministers in Paris. On Feb. 29, when President Jacques
Chirac of France visited the tribunal, she handed him a piece of
paper with the names of three Bosnian Serbs in the French sector
whose indictment she had just signed days before.
</P>
<P>
   Tribunal officials will not reveal the names of the other two,
but the third, Krajisnik, the right-hand man of Bosnian Serb
wartime leader Radovan Karadzic, who was indicted by the tribunal
in 1995, was pulled out of bed by French troops a month after
Chirac's visit to The Hague. By NATO standards, a month between
indictment and arrest is a record time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contrary to my predecessors, I've had no cooperation problems
with France,'' del Ponte bluntly told the newspaper Le Monde last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Insiders say that it does not hurt either that the new tribunal
president is a Frenchman. Judge Claude Jorda took over from an
American judge, Gabrielle Kirk McDonald, last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the tribunal still faces obstacles. Two Bosnian Serbs
detained over two years ago for what is believed to be their
relatively minor role in the wartime killing and destruction almost
had to be released last week because, due in part to last year's
added burden of the Kosovo war, the tribunal's overstretched staff
of close to 800 apparently has had insufficient time to file
detailed charges against them. Del Ponte intervened, and the two
stayed in custody.
</P>
<P>
   With 39 detainees in custody at special cells near The Hague,
the tribunal now faces a bottleneck. The new government in Croatia,
which unlike that of the late President Franjo Tudjman is eager to
have indicted Croats face their day in court, already has handed
over a major war crimes suspect, Mladen Naletilic, after years of
stalling by Tudjman.
</P>
<P>
   There was some talk here last week whether Krajisnik's arrest
has now sent Karadzic, the most wanted political leader, across the
border into Serbia, beyond the reach of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   He is known not to be welcome in the circles of President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, his onetime patron. But the
capture of his close ally, Krajisnikhas, left Karadzic more
isolated. He is said to move from place to place, accompanied by
bodyguards, in the French sector of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb wartime commander who
personally oversaw the capture of Srebrenica and like Karadzic has
been twice indicted by the tribunal on charges of genocide, has
long been in Belgrade. Last month, he even appeared at a Belgrade
match between the Yugoslav and Chinese soccer teams.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers of the tribunal fear that the arrest of Krajisnik
may have to be a surrogate for Mladic and Karadzic, whose capture,
if attempted, is likely to be far riskier.
</P>
<P>
   Graham Blewitt, the tribunal's deputy prosecutor said he was
optimistic. ``We see this new arrest as the precursor of the arrest
of Karadzic,'' he said in an interview. ``We want to believe that
the French are going to comply with their promise, which is to
detain the people who have been indicted in Bosnia.''

19 MARINES DIE IN CRASH OF TROUBLE-PLAGUED OSPREY 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Marine Corps aircraft in the final stages of its
introduction crashed in Arizona on Saturday night, killing all 19
Marines on board and renewing questions about its safety.
</P>
<P>
   The MV-22 Osprey plunged from the sky and exploded at a small
regional airport in Marana, Ariz., 15 miles northwest of Tucson, as
it was preparing to land, said a Marine spokesman, Capt. Rob
Winchester. The Osprey is a technology hybrid with rotors that
swivel so that it can take off like a helicopter but cruise like a
turboprop commuter plane.
</P>
<P>
   This was the third crash of an Osprey in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the accident is under review. Military
investigators were dispatched to the scene from Yuma, Ariz., where
the flight originated, and from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Osprey that crashed and a second one were conducting a night
training mission about 9 p.m. local time, simulating the evacuation
of civilians. Most of the four crew members and 15 other Marines
who were killed had been stationed at Camp Pendleton, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters at the scene said eyewitnesses reported seeing the
aircraft head ``straight downward,'' Katy Heiden, a spokeswoman for
the Northwest Fire District, told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy has dogged the Osprey program since its inception in
1981. The Marine Corps has championed the Osprey as a faster,
larger and more flexible replacement for its Vietnam-era CH-46 Sea
Knight troop and cargo transport helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Marine commanders envision the Osprey as the ideal long-range
aircraft over the next 25 to 50 years for ferrying Marines from
Navy ships into combat zones, humanitarian operations or rescue
missions.
</P>
<P>
   Built jointly by Bell Helicopter Textron of Fort Worth and the
Boeing Co. in Ridley Park, Pa., the Osprey can reach speeds of more
than 400 miles per hour and an altitude of 25,000 feet. It is
designed to carry up to 24 people or external loads of 10,000
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   But at $44 million, the Osprey has drawn sharp criticism from
many military analysts for its steep cost as well as its safety
record. A report by the General Accounting Office, an investigative
arm of Congress, determined in 1990 that the Osprey was too heavy
and vibrated excessively in early tests.
</P>
<P>
   President George Bush, on the advice of Secretary of Defense
Richard B. Cheney, tried to kill the program in 1991. But Congress,
influenced by the Marines' powerful lobbying effort, kept the
program alive by continuing to finance development.
</P>
<P>
   Builders say modifications in the original design have made
today's Ospreys lighter and safer. President Clinton eventually
authorized the purchase of up to 458 planes for the Marines, Air
Force and Navy, with 360 of them going to the Marines.
</P>
<P>
   Two other Ospreys have crashed during the program's development.
One nonfatal crash, in Delaware in 1991, was attributed to wiring
problems in the gyro system, which ensures that an aircraft is
flying level. In the second accident, in Virginia in 1992, all
seven people on board were killed after an engine caught fire.
</P>
<P>
   The Osprey that crashed on Saturday was one of four based at the
Marine Corps air station in Yuma. The planes were conducting their
final test flights before being assigned to the first operational
Osprey squadron, in New River, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The final testing phase was originally scheduled to be completed
in late May or June, but Marine officials said this weekend's
accident could delay that. On Sunday, the Marines temporarily
suspended test flights of the remaining three Ospreys pending the
outcome of the crash investigation. The first full squadron of 12
operational aircraft was to be ready by January 2001.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released by the White House on Sunday, Clinton
said, ``This terrible loss of life is a reminder of how many men
and women in the nation's military put their lives at risk, each
and every day, so that we might be a free people.''

SECONDHAND STORES MOVE UPTOWN AND UPSCALE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ohio, Calif.)   By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shopping at secondhand stores, once the passion of an eclectic
few, is becoming a mainstream activity.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to those who have always been willing to hunt for
vintage dresses or the perfect side table at flea markets, more and
more consumers are looking to the resale industry to provide a
cheaper way to purchase everything from computers to designer jeans
to Sub-Zero refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
   Heightening demand is the fact that the industry has worked hard
to transform itself, with many owners adopting sophisticated
marketing techniques, building chain operations and adding
locations in affluent suburbs. Determined to shed their image as
dank backwaters for the down and out, many stores that sell used
goods have installed better lights, dressing rooms and even coffee
bars.
</P>
<P>
   Internet auction sites like eBay have also given new exposure
and high-technology chic to the age-old practice.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, sales at pawnshops, antique houses and secondhand
stores have been growing nearly twice as fast as regular retail. In
1997, the last year for which the Census Bureau kept comprehensive
numbers, Americans spent some $12 billion on merchandise purchased
at these secondhand stores, a jump of 50 percent from 1992. Census
estimates, which will not be confirmed until 2002, suggest that in
1999 the industry grew another 23 percent to $17 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That is spectacular growth by any measure, but all the more
surprising because it comes at a time when consumers can afford to
buy new. Pawnbroking, for example, has traditionally flourished in
hard times. Yet pawnbrokers' revenues in the last five years have
jumped roughly 15 percent to about $700 million in 1999, according
to Brian Smith, a member of the board of directors of the National
Pawnbrokers Association. The business has managed to thrive in part
by remaking itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have moved from inner cities out into the suburbs, so we
are not in bad areas where middle-income people are afraid of
going,'' he said. ``Eight years ago that was just not the case.''
</P>
<P>
   While sales of secondhand goods amount to only a little more
than 2 percent of all dollars spent on general apparel, merchandise
and furnishings in this country last year, the growing demand for
used goods still represents a sea change in the way Americans
perceive cast-offs. ``The used product business has really evolved
to a mainline retail business,'' said Ted Manly, president and
chief operating officer of Grow Biz International Inc., which runs
several chains of used goods stores.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, traditional retailers have trained
consumers to be price sensitive for a variety of goods. Discounters
like Target and Kmart have grown at the expense of department
stores, luring upper- and middle-income customers with low prices
on Martha Stewart pool furniture or embroidered tops.
</P>
<P>
   As buying cheap has become synonymous with smart shopping,
almost-new merchandise has also gained new cachet. ``Just over the
past five years, the increase in the acceptability of buying used
has been amazing,'' said Christa Weil, author of ``Secondhand
Chic'' (Pocket Books, 1999). ``I used to slink around doing it, and
now friends brag about buying secondhand.''
</P>
<P>
   She points to her best friend, who after years of mocking her
for shopping secondhand, actually bought her wedding dress from a
thrift shop specializing in vintage gowns.
</P>
<P>
   And while discount stores are still known for the frequently
second-rate durability of their goods, secondhand stores have built
a reputation as places with high-quality merchandise for low
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like nice things; I'm not a blue-light special person,''
said Pat Bolar, a housewife who shops for secondhand designer wear
at One More Time, a used clothing store in an upscale neighborhood
in Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the boom economy has supplied secondhand stores
with enormous amounts of quality merchandise. As Americans grow
wealthier, they are more likely to replace barely used sofa sets or
cull from their closets the Gucci pants worn once to a wedding last
year. High-quality tennis rackets bought with the best intentions
find their way to the used-product stores as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people get tired of things very quickly and it is
wonderful,'' said Jane Strauch, owner of Patrick's Consignment
Store in Pacific Grove, Calif. In January, for example, a local
resident consigned a stand-alone cherry wood jewelry chest that
still had the protective plastic from the factory on it.
</P>
<P>
   Some areas of this market are being fueled by the rapid
obsolescence of high-technology gear. The resale personal computer
business barely existed a decade ago. Now industry insiders
estimate it exceeds $5 billion a year as businesses, in particular,
struggle to keep up with the new gadgets and the increases in
computing power unveiled each year.
</P>
<P>
   To afford their power needs, consumers and businesses are mixing
and matching their computer hardware. ``We sell to a very broad
base of customers,'' said Taylor Branch, president of the 210-store
used-computer chain Computer Renaissance, which had $150 million in
sales last year. ``Because our stores offer both new and used
systems, we often build a nice, new customized system for mom and
dad and then the kids will get refurbished machines, because they
are the last people the parents want playing on the new system,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The used music business is also exploding. ``Vinyls would wear
out, but the compact disc won't wear out absent physical abuse,''
said Jerry Grizzle, chairman and chief executive of CD Warehouse, a
360-store chain that sells used discs. ``The technology gave
validity to the used-music market.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the biggest change in the secondhand business has
been the revamping of the stores themselves. In recent years,
businesses ranging from tiny thrift stores to giant nonprofit
charities to pawn shops have upgraded store design, layout and
organization of goods. Goodwill Industries International, for
example, has added coffee bars to a half-dozen stores and has begun
putting couches in its used-book areas so customers can loll about.
</P>
<P>
   ``The retail market is much more competitive, so we have to do
everything we can to attract and retain customers,'' said Christine
Bragale, the charity's spokeswoman, exhibiting the kind of
consumer-first attitude that would make a Barnes &AMP; Noble manager
envious.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Goodwill is hardly alone in sprucing up. Throughout the
nonprofit world, secondhand stores are sweeping away dust bunnies
and adding overhead lighting. And, if anything, the changes have
been more drastic in the for-profit sector.
</P>
<P>
   Grow Biz International is just the largest of several
corporations that have tried to systematize the resale business by
bringing to it the levels of customer service and inventory display
shoppers are accustomed to at chains like The Gap or Limited.
Although most of Grow Biz's stores are independent franchises, they
follow standard policies on returns and guarantees of service.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, resale businesses have been hard to organize on a
national level because individual stores buy their own inventory
piecemeal from local sellers who bring in their castoffs. While
that remains the case, advances in data organizing software are
making it easier. CD Warehouse has a system that tracks customer
purchases at each of its stores, ranks what recordings are popular
with customers and assigns prices to them accordingly. That means
individual clerks do not have to guess what they might be worth.
</P>
<P>
   Secondhand goods have also flourished in the new retail medium
of the Internet. The explosion of used-goods auctions taking place
at popular online sites from eBay to Yahoo to Amazon.com have made
purchasing used memorabilia the cutting edge of chic, something
that owners of secondhand-goods stores think only rebounds to their
own good.
</P>
<P>
   ``EBay and everything on the Internet has helped our industry,''
said Alexandra Carroll, the departing president of the National
Association of Resale and Thrift shops. ``It keeps us on the mind
of our customers. The Internet has been a boon.''

<P>
   Shots explode at a school in Oregon, a brokerage office in
Atlanta, or a church in Fort Worth, and the nation is witness to
another sudden, seemingly random violent rampage. Before the
ambulances leave, the news crews arrive. The killers' neighbors,
friends or families submit to interviews, and inevitably, they say
something like this: ``He just snapped.''
</P>
<P>
   But the killers do not just snap. An examination by The New York
Times of 100 rampage murders found that most of the killers
spiraled down a long slow slide, mentally and emotionally. Most of
them left a road map of red flags, spending months plotting their
attacks and accumulating weapons, talking openly of their plans for
bloodshed. Many showed signs of serious mental health problems.
</P>
<P>
   But in case after case, the Times review found, the warning
signs were missed: by a tattered mental health care system; by
families unable to face the evidence of serious mental turmoil in
their children or siblings; by employers, teachers and principals
who failed to take the threats seriously; by the police who, when
alerted to the danger by frightened relatives, neighbors or
friends, were incapable of intervening before the violence erupted.
</P>
<P>
   James Davis, whose co-workers had nicknamed him Psycho, warned
his colleagues at a tool warehouse in Asheville, N.C., ``If they
ever decide to fire me, I'll take two or three of them with me.''
His employers did fire him, and feared he would respond with
violence, but despite his threats, they failed to protect his
co-workers when Davis returned to take his revenge.
</P>
<P>
   In 34 of the 100 cases, however, families or friends of the
killers desperately did try to find help for a person they feared
was a ticking time bomb, but were rebuffed by police, school
administrators or mental health workers.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Seegrist caromed in and out of mental institutions 12
times in 10 years, while her parents searched for a residential
program where she could stay in treatment. They knew she was
dangerous. She had stabbed a psychologist, tried to strangle her
mother, and had hidden a gun in her apartment. But each time, she
was released from the hospital when she seemed to improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were always fearful that maybe some tragedy would happen,''
said Ruth S. Seegrist, Sylvia's mother. ``She threatened it:
`Someday before I kill myself, I'll bring some people down with
me.''' Sylvia opened fire in a suburban Philadelphia shopping mall
in 1985, killing three people and wounding seven.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the recent spate of rampage-style mass shootings
in schools, workplaces, stores and other public places, The New
York Times re-examined 100 such violent incidents that occurred in
the United States over the last 50 years. The Times gathered
extensive information on all 100, and looked closely at more than
25 of the cases, a surprising number of which attracted little but
local attention.
</P>
<P>
   The examination included reviews of court cases, news coverage
and mental health records, and interviews with families and
friends, psychologists and victims, in an effort to glean what the
people closest to each tragedy had learned. In some cases,
reporters questioned the killers themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Based on this information, The Times found that in 63 of the 100
cases (which involve 102 killers), the killers made general threats
of violence to others in advance. Fifty-five of the 100 cases
involved killers who regularly expressed explosive anger or
frustration, and 35 killers had a history of violent behavior and
assaults. They were so noticeably unstable that even in their very
separate circles they had been awarded similar nicknames: ``Crazy
Pat,'' ``Crazy John,'' ``Crazy Joe.''
</P>
<P>
   And in 40 cases, family members and others said they noticed
sudden changes in behavior in the period before the rampage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you find out about each of these cases, the more it
makes sense,'' said Dewey G. Cornell, a clinical psychologist at
the University of Virginia and director of the Virginia Youth
Violence Project, which studies school safety and violence
prevention. ``This notion that someone just snaps is based on
ignorance and denial,'' Cornell said. ``People don't just snap.
Pressures build up.''
</P>
<P>
   Many psychologists caution that it is impossible to predict
violent behavior, and that most people who threaten violence never
follow through. Often, it is only in retrospect that each killer's
life appears to be a coherent chilling narrative foretelling
obvious danger. Looking back, it is easy to marvel that people who
knew the murderer could have failed to see it coming? In
particular, how could so many psychiatric workers, and even police,
have missed the warning signs?
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, there was no single person in the potential
killer's life to put together the lethal clues. Colleagues,
friends, family members, mental health professionals, teachers and
the police may have independently sensed something disturbing, but
they did not communicate with one another. Frightened neighbors or
co-workers decided it was safest to keep their distance. Friends
laughed off homicidal talk. Parents did not know where to turn, or
just hoped the irrational fury was merely a phase.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like looking at the night sky,'' said Dr. Robert
Granacher Jr., a psychiatrist in Lexington, Ky., who has examined
the records of several rampage murderers. ``If you only see one or
two stars, you may not see the whole constellation. It's the same
with these fragmentary bits of information; no one has the whole
picture.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the review of these cases suggests that if people
understood more about mental illness and connected the clues, many
of these rampage killings could be prevented.

particular, how could so many psychiatric workers, and even police,
have missed the warning signs?
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, there was no single person in the potential
killer's life to put together the lethal clues. Colleagues,
friends, family members, mental health professionals, teachers and
the police may have independently sensed something disturbing, but
they did not communicate with one another. Frightened neighbors or
co-workers decided it was safest to keep their distance. Friends
laughed off homicidal talk. Parents did not know where to turn, or
just hoped the irrational fury was merely a phase.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like looking at the night sky,'' said Dr. Robert
Granacher Jr., a psychiatrist in Lexington, Ky., who has examined
the records of several rampage murderers. ``If you only see one or
two stars, you may not see the whole constellation. It's the same
with these fragmentary bits of information; no one has the whole
picture.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the review of these cases suggests that if people
understood more about mental illness and connected the clues, many
of these rampage killings could be prevented.

   JAMIE ROUSE IN SCHOOL IN RURAL TENNESSEE
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Rouse, to a friend
</P>
<P>
   In rural Giles County, Tenn., on Nov. 15, 1995 _ before school
shootings regularly made headlines _ a slight 17-year-old strode
down the hall of Richland School with his black .22 Remington
Viper.
</P>
<P>
   His name was Jamie Rouse and, as always, he was dressed in
black. He walked up to two female teachers who were chatting in the
hall, and without a word shot each of them in the head. One teacher
was gravely wounded, the other died. Then Jamie Rouse smiled and
aimed for the school's football coach. But a student named Diane
Collins happened to cross his path. A bullet tore through her
throat. She was 16 when she died that day.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Rouse had sent distress signals for years to the adults in
his life. More startling, the police say he had told as many as
five teen-age friends exactly how he planned to bring his rifle to
school and begin killing. None of them had called anyone for help.
In fact, the night before, word of the planned massacre was passed
like macabre gossip along a chain of students, from Jamie, to his
close friend Stephen Abbott, to a teen-ager that Abbott worked with
at the gas station, Billy Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me something was going to happen at school the next
day, that I was going to lose a couple of friends,'' Rogers later
testified. ``Steve told me if there was a God he better make it
snow tonight so we ain't got school tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The rampage killers in the study, young and old, often talked
for months in advance about their murderous plans. And in 54 of the
100 cases, killers like Jamie Rouse provided explicit descriptions
of who, where or when they intended to kill.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Whitman, the infamous sniper who shot 45 people, killing
14, from atop the tower on the campus of the University of Texas at
Austin in 1966, had told a college psychiatrist four months before
the attack that he had been ``thinking about going up on the tower
with a deer rifle and start shooting people.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Carneal, a high school freshman in Paducah, Ky., told
schoolmates that ``it would be cool'' to shoot into a student
prayer group. He did as he had promised, killing three people and
injuring five in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Wurst, 14, showed a group of friends a gun hidden in his
father's dresser drawer and told them he planned to use nine shells
to kill nine people he hated, and then kill himself. In 1998, he
started shooting at his eighth-grade prom, killing a popular
teacher and injuring three other people.
</P>
<P>
   In case after case, friends, family members and others who heard
the threats and did not take action later said they did not act
because it seemed unfathomable that a human being would carry
through with such threats. Others said they had heard the killer
boast of violence so often that, like the villagers hardened to the
boy who cried wolf, they just did not take it seriously.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony, Stephen Ray, one of Jamie Rouse's closest friends,
said that it had sounded ridiculous when Rouse ``might have'' said
something about shooting someone the day before the killings, when
Rouse was fuming over a fender-bender with a schoolmate's car.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, now 21 and a college student in Knoxville, trembled in an
interview in his dormitory this winter when he said it was hard to
tell at the time that Jamie Rouse's blustery threats were real.
Even when Rouse showed up in the morning with a rifle and a box of
bullets, Ray said, he did not believe Jamie would really do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a joke,'' Ray said in a tone of amazement. ``It
wasn't a high school prank. It was something real.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee prosecutors said they were frustrated that legal rules
barred them from charging Ray with a crime because he did nothing
active to foster the plan. They did prosecute the teen-ager who
drove Rouse to school that morning.
</P>
<P>
   Failing to act in the face of warning signs, the prosecutors
said, was not a crime. In retrospect, there were many people guilty
of that.
</P>
<P>
   In ninth grade, Jamie had scratched an inverted cross on his
forehead, a symbol other students had told him was a sign of Satan
worship. Many people, including teachers, had noticed the mark,
which lasted a few weeks, and talked about it among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   At home during his junior year, Jamie held his brother Jeremy at
gunpoint and threatened to kill him. As punishment, Jamie's parents
took away his gun.
</P>
<P>
   As his senior year began, he submitted his entry for the
yearbook: ``I, Satan, James Rouse, leave my bad memories here to my
two brothers.'' By that time, according to testimony at his trial,
Jamie Rouse was working nights, taking Max Alert to stay awake and
Sominex to get to sleep, and listening to heavy metal music cranked
very loud because it drowned out the voices in his head that he
later told psychiatrists he had been hearing at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The spring before the shootings, Rouse got into a violent fight
with two other boys at school. But when teachers broke it up,
``Jamie just would not calm down,'' recalled Ronald W. Shirey Jr.,
the football coach that Jamie had missed shooting, in an interview
in his living room a few miles from the school. ``He was just
totally out of control, and saying, `I will kill you,' '' Shirey
said.
</P>
<P>
   The school called the police after that fight. Rouse faced
juvenile charges and was suspended for three days.
</P>
<P>
   But time passed. His mother later said it had not occurred to
her to get counseling for him. And when hunting season started,
Jamie's parents gave him his rifle back.
</P>
<P>
   Long after the crime, Shirey said, when government investigators
sought to study ways to prevent school shootings, they asked him to
circulate a survey among the teachers at Richland School, which
includes students from kindergarten to grade 12, to gather
information about Jamie Rouse. No survey came back with more than a
paragraph, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't find a teacher up there that was close to Jamie
Rouse since elementary school,'' Shirey said. ``Nobody knew enough
about him to say anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The adults noticed Jamie Rouse but did not know him, and the
teen-agers who knew him did not tell.

   SYLVIA SEEGRIST IN SUBURBAN PHILADELPHIA
</P>
<P>
   ``I genuinely thought the public would be pleased because I
thought all the public could see this and know and understand my
good-intentions.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Seegrist, in a letter to a reporter from prison, Jan. 4, 2000
</P>
<P>
   She was dressed in the green Army fatigues and knit cap she wore
all four seasons of the year as she drove into the parking lot of
the Springfield Mall in suburban Philadelphia. She leaped out of
her car firing a Ruger semiautomatic rifle, and continued spraying
bullets as she ran through the mall, killing three people and
injuring seven, all strangers. Among the dead was a 2-year-old boy
whose family had been shopping for a church charity fashion show.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Seegrist was 25 the day of her murder spree in 1985. The
crime was the culmination of 10 years of mounting psychosis,
crippling delusions and violent assaults on people who tried to
help her.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, in a recent interview in her apartment a few miles
from the site of Sylvia Seegrist's rampage, remembered the
``feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, despair, of incredible
sadness'' as she and her husband watched their only daughter
overtaken by schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   They also feared her. ``I'll take you out,'' Seegrist recalls
her daughter threatening.
</P>
<P>
   The Times' study found that many of the rampage killers,
including Sylvia Seegrist, suffered from severe psychosis, were
known by people in their circles as being noticeably ill and
needing help, and received insufficient or inconsistent treatment
from a mental health system that seemed incapable of helping these
especially intractable patients.
</P>
<P>
   Only a small percentage of mentally ill people are violent, and
many advocates bristle at any link between mental illness and
violence out of concern that it will further stigmatize an already
mistreated population.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Times investigation of this particular style of
violence _ public rampage killings _ turned up an extremely high
association between violence and mental illness. Forty-seven of the
killers had a history of mental health problems before they killed;
20 had been hospitalized for psychiatric problems; 42 had been seen
by mental health professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Psychiatric drugs had been prescribed at some point before the
rampages to 24 of the killers, and 14 of those people were not
taking their prescribed drugs when they killed. Diagnoses of mental
illness are often difficult to pin down, so The Times tabulated
behavior: 23 killers showed signs of serious depression before the
killings, and 49 expressed paranoid ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the killers who survived their rampages have made it
clear they prefer to be thought of as criminal rather than mentally
ill. Back in 1966, Robert Benjamin Smith, an 18-year-old high
school senior in Mesa, Ariz., said he believed he was God when he
herded five women and two children into the back room of a beauty
school, forced them to lie down in a circle and methodically shot
each person in the head, killing five of them.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter Smith sent to a Times reporter from prison in
January, he brushed off questions about illness and wrote,
``Lessons? The sole thing I have learned worth the telling is the
ironclad necessity of retaining control over one's essential bodily
fluids.'' He blamed ``sexual self-stimulation'' for his crime and
noted that he had tried to amputate his penis while in prison using
the pull-tab from a can of Diet Dr Pepper.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more ill they are, the less sensibility there is'' in the
violent attack itself, said Dr. Anthony G. Hempel, chief forensic
psychiatrist at the Vernon campus of North Texas State Hospital,
who has studied mass murderers. In contrast to the killers who ``go
postal,'' gunning for their bosses, Hempel said, ``when someone
goes and kills strangers or they kill children, the odds of them
being mentally ill are higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Seegrist was first hospitalized at 16, and schizophrenia
was diagnosed. Each of the dozen times she was discharged,
psychiatrists deemed that she no longer posed a threat to herself
or others.
</P>
<P>
   No one said she was getting better, though. At the local health
club Seegrist was seen taking steam baths in her camouflage
clothing. At the library, she spouted a tangle of theories about
nuclear weapons, energy shortages and famine. Between her
daughter's hospitalizations, Seegrist found a gun in Sylvia's
apartment, she said. Sylvia Seegrist told her mother she planned to
use it to kill her parents and then herself.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother said the family could not afford private
rehabilitation programs, and their insurance covered only
short-term hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Seegrist, now 39, is serving a life sentence at a prison
in Pennsylvania. She declined an interview, instead writing two
letters to The Times, a weave of lucid fragments and unintelligible
passages about benzene and Styrofoam. On the back of an envelope,
she writes that her killings were a form of public service.
</P>
<P>
   She also seems to assert that she had to kill to ensure she
would be imprisoned instead of being sent yet again to a state
mental hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure had all kinds of theories in my head,'' she wrote,
``expressed them at political meetings, just doll, understand,
please 10 yrs. of beat-up, orphan in state hospitals that are 300
percent worse than even Sing-Sing prison. All the throwaways
retarded smearing feces on themselves, when I read research
materials at Ivy league colleges, and watched nothing but CNN and
C-SPAN at home.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she had no choice. ``It had to be `a serious crime' or
I'd get the state hospital i.e. Nazi camp.''

   JEFFREY WALLACE IN KEY WEST AND JOSEPH BROOKS JR. IN DETROIT
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to save myself and my family.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Wallace, in a prison interview, Feb. 1, 2000
</P>
<P>
   Roxie M. Wallace knew something was wrong when her grown son
Jeffrey visited her and padlocked his room. He sometimes slept with
a knife by his bed. He was growing increasingly paranoid, she
realized. He would talk incessantly about evil forces. Most
disturbing, she said in interviews and letters, her son sometimes
growled ``like a small dog or a wolf.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Wallace offers a glimpse into how difficult it can be to
shake someone out of a delusional universe, even when friends and
relatives notice and want to do something about it. Wallace, like
other rampage killers, was convinced he was defending himself
against an intricate conspiracy. Of the 100 cases in the study, 49
involved killers who had shown extreme, irrational suspicion and
mistrust. In their paranoia, they think they must defend themselves
against threats that other people do not see.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, incarcerated in an isolated Florida prison, Wallace,
38, insists that he had no choice but to open fire in 1997 at a Key
West bar where he once worked, killing one person and injuring
three others.
</P>
<P>
   In a long prison interview, Wallace was unable to deviate from
his convoluted theory that the bar was the center of an
organized-crime drug and prostitution ring with ties _ he was sure
_ to Satanism, President Clinton and Garrison Keillor, host of the
public radio program ``Prairie Home Companion.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace's lawyers argued unsuccessfully that he was insane, but
Wallace insists his actions were perfectly rational.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best example I can give,'' Wallace said, ``is you're in
your house and somebody breaks in and you have to defend yourself
and you end up killing somebody. It's terrible, but what else can
you do?''
</P>
<P>
   From her home in Tennessee, Wallace said she had tried for years
to maneuver her son toward help when he did not want it. ``I was
afraid he was either going to kill himself or he was going to
`fight back' to save himself like a caged animal,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many rampage killers are extremely difficult to treat, say
psychiatrists who have interviewed them. They may deny their
illness and resist medication and treatment, and are often shrewd
about masking symptoms to avoid being hospitalized involuntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who do receive psychiatric treatment do not always
get the help they need.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Brooks Jr. was a policeman's son from Detroit and one of
the few black students to win entrance to both a prestigious local
preparatory school and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Friends in the fraternity house where Brooks lived recall no hint
of anger or illness, only that Brooks was absurdly meticulous about
his chores, and studied so compulsively that they nicknamed him
``Books.'' But in his third year at MIT, he tried to commit
suicide, was hospitalized for obsessive-compulsive disorder, and
later received a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Detroit, living alone, Brooks, 28, sought treatment with
Dr. Reuven Bar-Levav, a well-known local psychiatrist who ran group
therapy sessions in Southfield attended by a close-knit clientele
of upper-middle-class patients coping with depression or anxiety
disorders _ nothing as severe as paranoid schizophrenia. Brooks
joined the group sessions, but refused to take the medication he
had been prescribed, telling friends that the drugs made him
tremble, gain weight and lose concentration.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Rissman, a fellow patient in the therapy group Brooks
joined, said in an interview, ``It was obvious he was not in touch
with reality. He would laugh inappropriately. Within a matter of
two or three group sessions, it became apparent to most of the
senior patients that he did not belong there, that he should have
been institutionalized.''
</P>
<P>
   Rissman said he and several other patients and therapists in the
group practice repeatedly went to Bar-Levav with their concerns
about Brooks. And in one group session _ with Brooks in the room _
a patient named Mary Gregg told the group she was afraid of Brooks,
Rissman recalled.
</P>
<P>
   After about eight group sessions, Bar-Levav finally terminated
Brooks' treatment and referred him to other therapists.
</P>
<P>
   Eight months later, on June 11 last year, Brooks returned to the
psychiatrist's office and killed Bar-Levav. Brooks then pivoted and
fired into the therapy group he had once attended, killing Gregg
and wounding four others, including Rissman, who leapt up to close
the door. Brooks then turned the gun on himself.
</P>
<P>
   Bar-Levav had been given some warning: While in treatment,
Brooks had handed a gun over to another therapist in the practice
and confessed he had come close to killing his girlfriend's mother
and committing suicide. And just before the killings, Brooks sent
Bar-Levav a 52-page manuscript critiquing the therapy he had
received from him. The critique contained obsessive, paranoid
passages about a ``German American woman'' humiliating him in his
therapy group, and hints of menace. The local police emphasized in
interviews with The Times that Bar-Levav should have alerted them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have taken that weapon away from him,'' said Joseph
Thomas, the chief of police in Southfield, a suburn just north of
Detroit. But even had the police confiscated the gun, the killing
would not have been prevented. Brooks easily obtained a second
permit and a second gun _ an expensive limited-edition combat-style
handgun, which he used to kill Bar-Levav.
</P>
<P>
   The psychiatrist's daughter, Dr. Leora Bar-Levav, a therapist
herself who worked with her father and is now carrying on his
practice, rejected with a pained wince the suggestion of
negligence. In a conversation in the practice's new offices in
Southfield, she said the problem was instead a permissive society
and a narcissistic patient who had rejected treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink
it,'' she said. ``Denial is very potent.''

   JAMES DAVIS IN ASHEVILLE, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have it because I probably wouldn't need it much
longer.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Davis, on giving his niece a video game a few days before his
workplace rampage
</P>
<P>
   A man storms a warehouse where he was recently fired, leaving a
trail of shell casings, three dead workers and four more wounded.
The news story the next day begins, ``A disgruntled former employee
went on a shooting rampage.''
</P>
<P>
   In the turmoil that follows a rampage shooting by a killer like
James Davis in Asheville, N.C., there is usually a scramble to
pinpoint the cause. And in a world of rapid news cycles, the
answers come quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was the ``disgruntled employee.'' In the news coverage,
Dung Trinh was so bereaved at the death of his mother that he shot
at nurses last year in a hospital in Anaheim, Calif., where she had
once been treated. Sometimes the reason is reported to be a broken
marriage, a spurned romance or financial misfortune. Mark O.
Barton, a rampage killer in Atlanta, was reported to have singled
out day traders because he had suffered huge losses in the market.
</P>
<P>
   These are the kinds of events that often result in the
observation, ``He just snapped.''
</P>
<P>
   But the action that is often simplistically cited as the cause _
a firing, a divorce, an eviction _ is on closer examination just
the final provocation to a troubled, angry person who has already
left numerous warning markers, often available for many to see.
</P>
<P>
   When he opened fire in the day-trading office, Barton already
had problems deeper than his recent stock losses. Eight hours
earlier, he had killed his second wife and his children, and he was
still the prime suspect in the deaths six years earlier of his
first wife and her mother.
</P>
<P>
   Colin Ferguson, who opened fire on rush-hour commuters on the
Long Island Rail Road, had displayed such menacing behavior that he
received an eviction notice, which further fueled his fury.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the workplace shooters had been fired or disciplined
precisely because they were already threatening violence, behaving
bizarrely or getting in fights. Of the 81 adult murderers The Times
looked at, 49 were unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was no mild-mannered worker who just mysteriously snapped,
according to court records and interviews.
</P>
<P>
   He repeatedly picked fights at the tool warehouse where he
worked in Asheville, and had often told colleagues that if he were
ever fired, he would return to kill his bosses. He had seen combat
in Vietnam and been hospitalized with schizophrenia after the war.
He lived alone, and co-workers knew he owned a .44 magnum with a
scope and had practiced firing it in his basement.
</P>
<P>
   One Wednesday in May 1995, he got into another fight at work,
his last.
</P>
<P>
   That weekend, his family noticed that he was acting strangely.
For example, Davis, an unemotional recluse, told his sister he
loved her. And though James had never given anything to anybody,
his brother, William, later said, James had wanted to give his
niece a chess set and video game the weekend before. His siblings
tried to persuade him to go to a hospital for psychiatric help, but
he refused.
</P>
<P>
   That Monday, James Davis was fired. His bosses were so anxious
about his reaction that they agreed to break the news in a room
where they could use a table to deflect an attack. Some employees
planned escape routes when they heard of Davis' firing.
</P>
<P>
   Just after midnight on Wednesday, William Davis called the
police from his house 100 miles away to tell them that James had
left home in a nervous frenzy and left all his personal belongings
with their mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see why you got to wait till he kills himself or
somebody,'' William Davis told the police, according to a
transcript of his telephone call. ``If you send a patrol car out to
that plant, he's probably sitting there. Or notify them.'' William
Davis told the police, ``I don't know for sure, but I know and
believe by the warning signs he gave me he's going to die.'' The
Asheville police did drive by James Davis' house, but said that
when they saw there was no vehicle in the driveway, there was
nothing else they could do.
</P>
<P>
   William Davis testified that he got in his car around 2 a.m. and
drove to what he thought was his brother's workplace. But because
he had not lived in Asheville for many years, he went to the wrong
plant. The gate was shut, so he drove back to his mother's house to
sleep.
</P>
<P>
   James Davis never came home. That morning, on Wednesday, May 17,
he stormed the Union Butterfield plant. Two of the victims were the
bosses who fired him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live for the rest of my life knowing that if someone had
listened to me, no one would have died,'' William Davis said in an
interview. ``I could have stopped it if someone would have
listened.''
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, with Davis already on death row, a jury considered
a civil suit claiming that his employers had failed to protect the
other employees from a man they knew to be violent. A lawyer for
the company argued there was no way anyone could foresee such an
attack.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the victims said, ``This case is a human tragedy
because this could have been prevented.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury agreed, awarding the families of two of the victims
$7.9 million. An appeal has been filed.

   KIP KINKEL IN SCHOOL IN OREGON
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a horrible son. I wish I had been aborted. I destroy
everything I touch. I can't eat. I can't sleep. I didn't deserve
them. They were wonderful people. It's not their fault or the fault
of any person, organization, or television show. My head just
doesn't work right. God damn these VOICES inside my head.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ From the note Kip Kinkel left on the coffee table in his house
after &QR; 
killing his parents
</P>
<P>
   Even the cases that drew wide attention offer fresh insights
when re-examined in the context of the Times review.
</P>
<P>
   One spring day, Kipland P. Kinkel, a freckle-faced boy with a
history of behavior problems in school, disrupted his ninth-grade
literature class by abruptly yelling out loud, ``God damn this
voice inside my head!''
</P>
<P>
   His teacher took immediate action. He wrote up a disciplinary
note. ``In the future,'' it asked, ``what could you do differently
to prevent this problem?''
</P>
<P>
   Kip dutifully filled out the answer: ``Not to say `Damn'''
</P>
<P>
   The note was signed by the teacher. Kip took it home to his
mother, and she signed it too.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody paid attention to the part about the voice inside Kip's
head.
</P>
<P>
   One month later, on May 20, 1998, Kip was suspended from school
for buying a stolen gun and stashing it in his locker. That
afternoon, back at home in a wooded neighborhood called Shangri La,
Kip Kinkel, 15, shot his father and then his mother.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning he drove to his school in Springfield, Ore.,
and shot 24 people in the cafeteria, killing two students.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes even concerned parents, like the Kinkels, or other
caring adults, find the specter of serious mental or emotional
problems in a child so disturbing that they lapse into denial, the
study found over and over.
</P>
<P>
   The youngsters themselves often unwittingly assist in the denial
by being reluctant to tell someone about hearing voices or having
bizarre thoughts, in fear of being labeled mentally ill.
Complicating the picture is the fact that in adolescents like Kip,
the symptoms are most likely just emerging, psychiatric experts
say.
</P>
<P>
   Kip Kinkel's parents, while perhaps unwilling to face the
serious implications of his outburst in class, had not been blind
to his problems, according to interviews and court records. They
were both schoolteachers, and such behavior would have been hard to
ignore. Starting at age 6, when Kip hit a boy twice his age with a
piece of metal bar, he was susceptible to uncontrollable rages.
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager, like many of the killers in the study, he showed
an inordinate fascination with weapons. He collected knives,
secretly built explosives and boasted to friends that he wanted to
be the next Unabomber. He detonated explosives at a local quarry
and was caught by the police throwing rocks at cars off a highway
overpass, a prank that some psychologists say is an early
indication of a potential for violent tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   His mother took him to a therapist. Kip showed symptoms, the
therapist noted, of ``major depressive disorder,'' and was
prescribed Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   But William Kinkel, Kip's father, did not approve of therapy,
and never attended the sessions, Mark Sabitt, Kip's defense lawyer,
said in an interview. Sabitt said that the senior Kinkel was ``a
very proud individual and aware of his image in the community. He
was very skeptical of counseling in general and closed to the
notion of someone in his family needing treatment, or even worse,
being mentally ill. It just didn't fit with the image he had of his
kids and what he hoped they would be.''
</P>
<P>
   After nine therapy sessions and three months of summer vacation
on Prozac, Kip's behavior improved, so his parents discontinued the
therapy and the medication. Kip's father bought him the Glock
semiautomatic pistol his son had been pestering him for.
</P>
<P>
   At Kip's sentencing hearing, the defense presented a family tree
showing severe mental illness, including schizophrenia, affecting
three generations on both the maternal and paternal sides.
</P>
<P>
   When Kip's victims addressed the judge, some said he was faking
insanity. Others said that even if insane, he should be held
responsible for ripping apart their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if you're sick, if you're insane, if you're
crazy,'' said Jacob Ryker, one of the students who finally tackled
Kip, despite gunshot wounds in his own chest and arm. ``I don't
care. I think prison, a lifetime in prison is too good for you. If
a dog was to go insane and if a dog got rabid and it bit someone,
you destroy it. So I stand here and I ask, why haven't you been
destroyed? I question myself for not pulling the trigger.''

   SGT. WILLIAM KREUTZER JR. AT FORT BRAGG, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to go. I'm loading magazines.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Kreutzer, in his last telephone call to a squadmate
</P>
<P>
   An agitated Sgt. William Kreutzer Jr. telephoned a friend in his
squad at Fort Bragg, N.C. He said the shooting would begin the next
morning at daybreak, just when 1,300 soldiers were on a field
stretching before their morning run.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he was going to `mow them down,''' said his friend,
Spc. Burl F. Mays.
</P>
<P>
   True, Kreutzer was an odd loner who talked about killing so
often that the men in his company had nicknamed him Crazy Kreutzer
and Silence of the Lambs. But when Mays arrived early the next
morning and saw Kreutzer was not in, he feared that this time it
was no idle threat. He told his superiors just before 5 a.m. and
was asked to check Kreutzer's room.
</P>
<P>
   He found that the bed had not been slept in. On the desk he
found a draft of Kreutzer's will.
</P>
<P>
   Mays later testified that when he then tried to alarm superiors,
the first sergeant dismissed his concerns, saying something like,
``Kreutzer is a pussy, he wouldn't do anything like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The case of Kreutzer, told in court records and interviews,
illustrates an altogether different common case: the depressed and
angry misfit provoked by the people around him.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Park Elliott Dietz, a psychiatrist and expert on mass
killers, said people who became mass murderers were often ``handled
in a provocative, ineffective way.'' Their outrageous fantasies of
violence draw public condemnation or ridicule. Humiliation, Dietz
said, often precedes rampage killing.
</P>
<P>
   Kreutzer, a gawky perfectionist, had long been the object of
ridicule in his squad at Fort Bragg. When his unit was sent to the
Sinai, other soldiers tied his shoelaces together while he slept.
They filled his boots with sand. Kreutzer, 26, had always wanted to
be a soldier, but he lagged behind on company runs and sometimes
misplaced equipment. He cried when criticized. When he repeatedly
threatened to kill other soldiers, they took it as a joke.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen months before his final ambush, when Kreutzer had an
outburst in which he threatened to kill soldiers and it became
common knowledge, his superiors sent him to a military social
worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me that he had specific plans to kill the people in
his squad,'' the counselor, Darren Fong, told military
investigators, the court-martial documents show. But when he was
returned to full duty, Kreutzer was not referred to Army
psychiatrists. He was barred from access to weapons for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The morning of Oct. 27, 1995, Kreutzer hid in the woods and
fired onto a field of American soldiers. He wounded 18 of them, and
killed Maj. Stephen Mark Badger, an intelligence officer and a
father and stepfather of eight children.
</P>
<P>
   Kreutzer kept firing until he was tackled from behind by two
comrades.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, he spoke to a military police officer, Bruce W.
Hamrick.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he kept warning people that he was going to kill
somebody,'' Hamrick testified, ``but that nobody would listen.''

A RESURGENT MICHIGAN LEADS NEWLY FLUSH STATES 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER T. KILBORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANSING, Mich. _ Lawmakers here and in many other states, now in
the throes of writing their budgets for the 2001 fiscal year, are
witnessing the biggest of six consecutive years of rising revenues,
which have inspired inventive new ways to spend money and wave upon
wave of tax reductions.
</P>
<P>
   States are collecting revenues from the taxes on surging
industries, fully employed work forces, stock-market gains and _
this year, for the first time _ from a two-decade-long, $246
billion windfall from the settlement of their suit against the
tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The states are overflowing with money and spending a lot of
money,'' said Stephen Moore, an economist at the conservative Cato
Institute in Washington. ``You are starting to see _ among
Republican governors, by the way _ budget increases of 6, 7, 8
percent a year. States are continuing to cut taxes, too. But the
money is coming in so fast they haven't kept pace.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary S. Olson, director of Michigan's nonpartisan Senate Fiscal
Agency, which tracks the state's finances, said: ``This is sort of
an ideal situation. Michigan had never been able to reduce taxes
and raise spending at the same time. I've worked in the Legislature
since 1978, and clearly these are the best times I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the peculiarities of their taxation systems or their
economies, a few states like Wyoming, Iowa, Kansas, Tennessee and
New Hampshire are not reaping much of this harvest. But most are.
New York, California, Texas, Maryland, Minnesota, Indiana,
Washington, Pennsylvania and Michigan have been amassing annual
surpluses exceeding $1 billion, typically representing hundreds of
idle tax dollars collected from each of their citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The surpluses have spurred new spending plans and an array of
tax reductions. In Maine, Gov. Angus King, an independent, would
give a laptop computer to every seventh-grader. Gov. Parris
Glendening of Maryland, a Democrat, would buy textbooks for
students in the state's 500 private schools. In the fall, Gov. Tom
Ridge of Pennsylvania, a Republican, will send the state's 3.3
million homeowners a tax-rebate check of $100.
</P>
<P>
   Some states are cutting sales taxes on food and clothes, and
property taxes on automobiles. Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota, an
independent, has handed taxpayers $1.3 billion in sales-tax
rebates. In January, Gov. Bob Taft of Ohio, a Republican, put into
effect tax breaks for adoptions and college tuition.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Gov. George Pataki's priority is lopping $1.25
billion from the state's debt, saving taxpayers the cost of
carrying it, but incurring the wrath of Democratic legislators and
many Republicans who want more tax cuts and spending.
</P>
<P>
   In his new budget, Gov. John Engler of Michigan is dipping into
the state's tobacco-settlement money for $83 million to give $2,500
college scholarships to students who pass a state achievement test.
</P>
<P>
   He proposes awarding $1,000 bonuses to the staff of
high-performing schools, from principals to janitors. He is
creating a virtual high school for students to take advanced
courses through the Internet that are unavailable in rural areas.
And he plans to give all 80,000 public school teachers laptop
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers are beginning to call their surpluses ``structural,''
prosperity's antithesis to the structural deficits of much of the
1900s. By law, states, unlike the federal government, must erase
one year's deficit the next year with spending cuts or tax
increases. The serial surpluses of the 1990s and 2000 let them
build reserves to tide them over in a moderate recession without
their having to touch programs and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But in choosing where to dispense prosperity's bounty,
Democratic leaders in the states, most of which have Republican
governors, say the big beneficiaries are businesses and the rich.
``There is a percentage of our citizenry,'' said state Sen. Alma
Wheeler, D-Ann Arbor, ``that is not having its boat floated by this
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Hubert Price, D-Pontiac, calculates that a family of
three with Michigan's median income of $40,000 will save $1.20 a
week from a recent cut in the income-tax rate to 4.2 percent from
4.4 percent. ``I haven't had any constituents walk up to me in the
grocery store and say `Thank you,''' Price said.
</P>
<P>
   And public policy analysts say the prudence that states showed
in the mid-1990s in setting aside rainy-day funds to weather
recessions has begun to wane. ``Until now, it's been a series of
happy surprises,'' said Iris Lav, an economist and expert on state
finance at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities in
Washington, ``Every year, revenues come in higher than forecast.''
</P>
<P>
   But she said three or four years of lowered tax rates and rising
spending were consuming a larger part of the rising revenues,
reducing the surpluses and resources set aside for recessions. The
National Conference of State Legislatures in Denver reports that
reserves have dropped to $30 billion this year from $37.5 billion
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the tax cuts, especially the rebates, are one-time
events, said Mandy Rafool, a senior policy analyst at the
conference. ``They're trying to give the money back but play it
safe,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And to avoid the one-year jolt of sharp tax-rate reductions,
many legislatures favor small, phased reductions like Michigan's
23-year elimination of a tax on business. In that way, she said,
they avoid the political repercussions of raising taxes to cope
with recessions.
</P>
<P>
   No state has gained more from prosperity and surpluses than
Michigan, where the cities of Flint, Pontiac, Benton Harbor and
Detroit formed the downtrodden core of a region that economists
called the rust belt. For decades Michigan and West Virginia shared
the nation's highest unemployment rates, often exceeding 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In February, however, Michigan's unemployment rate was a mere
2.7 percent, one of the nation's lowest, the state's lowest in at
least 30 years, and well below the national rate of 4.1 percent.
Automobile workers are working overtime and earning an average of
$60,000 a year. On top of that, they are collecting $8,000 and
$10,000 annual bonuses _ all taxable income that feeds the surplus.

</P>
<P>
   Such unanticipated tides of revenue are pouring into the state
treasury at a rate of $2 million more a day than the governor's
economists predicted just a year ago, and hundreds of thousands of
dollars a day above their predictions as recently as January, when
Engler submitted his budget.
</P>
<P>
   The governor was first elected 10 years ago as a tight-fisted,
tax-cutting crime-fighter, and has cracked down on parole and young
offenders. Crime is down, as it is in the rest of the country, but
prison terms have stretched, and the prison population has doubled
during his tenure, to 40,000.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of next year, Engler and the Republican-controlled
Legislature will have added 10,200 prison beds, with 3,700 opening
this year. Spending for prisons has doubled during his tenure,
reaching $1.5 billion last year, just $100 million less than
spending for Michigan's colleges and universities. This year,
Engler is proposing to raise prison spending by nearly 9 percent,
about the same amount as last year.
</P>
<P>
   He has also chopped hundreds of millions of dollars in state and
federal welfare spending by steering recipients into jobs and
cutting the caseload from 238,000 in 1994 to 74,800 in January _
the lowest in 30 years. Last year for the first time, spending for
day care _ mostly for former welfare recipients who have gone to
work _ exceeded spending for cash assistance programs.
</P>
<P>
   The rising revenues have let Engler make 31 tax cuts since
taking office _ the last five in January _ and accelerate spending
from a 3 percent annual increase to over 4 percent. At that pace,
he has begun letting the rainy-day fund decline from 7 percent of
state revenues to 5 percent, the minimum that economists say a
state needs in a recession.
</P>
<P>
   But 5 percent, representing $1.6 billion, is still well above
the levels of the 1980s, when the fund never exceeded $500 million.
``We could take a two-year hit and still be OK,'' said Robert J.
Kleine, senior economist at Public Sector Consultants in Lansing, a
private, nonpartisan research organization.
</P>
<P>
   Industrially, the state is more diversified, giving lawmakers
confidence that it can ride out recessions better now than in the
past. The old rust-belt industries of automobiles, appliances and
furniture have been driving the boom, but tax cuts may be
reinforcing it.
</P>
<P>
   All together, the governor's office says, the tax cuts have left
taxpayers with $15 billion more to save or to spend to keep the
economy rolling. ``Michigan is a case study that tax cuts work,''
said state Rep. Bill Schuette. ``I think by cutting taxes you're
able to flex your economic muscle.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan's new glut of money has also changed the tenor of
budget debates. To spurn entreaties for aid in the days of tight
budgets, said Mary A. Lannoye, Michigan's budget director, ``You
could say, `There is no money _ just no.''' In this climate, more
money shows up. So, she said, a legislator thinks, ``Here's an
opportunity to get a project I've been looking at for my
community.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Harry Gast, a Republican who is chairman of the
Senate Appropriations Committee, said that during the long
recession of the mid-1980s, ``we had to cut the budgets of 19
departments.'' But with year-after-year surpluses, he said, ``we
have programs coming out of the weeds _ groups with something warm
and fuzzy, and some of them have merit.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, as the revenues grow, Engler's adversaries say they have
begun to detect a softer view of the poor. ``I think the governor
is willing, in today's climate, to take itty-bitty steps,'' Price
said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after taking office, the governor eliminated the state's
general assistance program, casting 83,000 single adults and
childless couples from the welfare rolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we haven't had any more of those horrendous program
cuts,'' said Sharon Parks, a director of the Michigan League for
Human Services. And she said that last year the governor approved a
2.5 percent increase in cash assistance for families remaining on
welfare, the first increase in 12 years. Another increase, of 3
percent, will take effect in October.
</P>
<P>
   Engler has also given in to appeals for support of the arts,
with grants to libraries and museums. ``In the early 1990s there
was a significant cutback in arts and cultural spending in the
state,'' said Olson of the Senate Fiscal Agency, which tracks state
finances for the Senate. ``Now we're probably spending more for the
arts and culture than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the face of Michigan's bonanza, smoldering issues remain.
Surging health-care costs are eliminating small businesses' gains
from tax cuts, said the House Democratic leader, Michael Hanley.
More spending for child care, he said, would slow the progression
of young people to crime and prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly,'' said William Sederberg, president of Ferris State
University in Big Rapids, ``it would be better to spend more on
higher education than on incarcerating people.''

   LOS ANGELES _ The most dangerous mission that the Kings will
have to face in their first-round Stanley Cup playoff series
against the Detroit Red Wings: How to defuse Sergei Federov.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe no one else creates scoring opportunities as he can. After
all, dude's back in the Anna Kournikova sweepstakes, right?
</P>
<P>
   Go back a few weeks ago, when Red Wings coach Scotty Bowman
noticed how despondent his All-Star center was after news leaked
that his dear, sweet Anna had reached verbal agreement to a wedding
with Florida Panthers star Pavel Bure.
</P>
<P>
   Bowman allowed Federov to borrow the team charter and fly to
Phoenix to hook up with her when she was playing at a WTA event in
Scottsdale, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   The Fedster showed up with an armful of roses.
</P>
<P>
   Now, last week, Bure tells a Russian newspaper that a wedding
ain't happening because ``today I love hockey more than anything
else.'' (This from a guy with a brother named Valeri). Kournikova
also writes on her Web site that ``I never said I was engaged or
planning to get married.... It is hard for me to understand that
some people believe everything they see in the media.''
</P>
<P>
   (Which means... we (begin ital)shouldn't(end ital) believe that
Russian newspaper?)
</P>
<P>
   Did Serge surge ahead? What caused Pavel to repel? Which one of
'em is gonna end up like Dustin Hoffman in ``The Graduate''
pounding on the church glass?
</P>
<P>
   When Anna submits to a live Web chat today (4 p.m., via
www.kournikova.com), our plan is to exacerbate the situation. For
the Kings' sake, of course.
</P>
<P>
   But if they don't make it past the first round, and if somehow
we see a Red Wings-Panthers final series, there should be more than
just Lord Stanley's loving cup at stake.
</P>
<P>
   There'll be more subplots than a you-know-what...
</P>
<P>
   -Hey, priority numbers are already being divvied up for Avengers
playoff tickets, so stop your freakin' shovin'....
</P>
<P>
   -The next time Todd Marinovich's path could cross with Tommy
Maddox's: If the Avengers face the New Jersey Red Dogs in ArenaBowl
XIV this August....
</P>
<P>
   -It was CBS' Ken Venturi who said on the telecast that David
Duval was lining up a shot during the final round of the Masters
that was ``like putting on a marble staircase.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because the greens were as fast as bikini wax, y'know....
</P>
<P>
   -Oh, sorry, double-D. Didn't mean to (begin ital)irritate(end
ital) you....
</P>
<P>
   -So (begin ital)thhhhhis(end ital) is what horse smack sounds
like?
</P>
<P>
   Jenine Sahadi has every right to liken Bob Baffert to a horse's
rear end now, but since The Deputy is the new sheriff in town, the
message has already been delivered....
</P>
<P>
   -That really was the Czech Republic national anthem. It was just
a Howie Mandel rendition....
</P>
<P>
   -Obscure TV stat of the weekend: The Mets' Matt Franco (Westlake
High) set a major-league record last season by drawing 20 walks as
a pinch hitter....
</P>
<P>
   -The Dodgers' scouting report on 6-year-old Cuban refugee Elian
Gonzalez: Plays well with others....
</P>
<P>
   -No one has been allowed to start selling off souvenir chunks of
the Kingdome yet because they're going to pile it all up outside
Safeco Field and try to prevent ARod from leaving....
</P>
<P>
   -One last thought on the just-concluded ``Real World/Road Rule
Challenge'': great clothesline Amaya put on Veronica during the
flag football game. But then watching that whiny chick injure
herself during (begin ital)every single event(end ital) was an even
better payoff.

IN THE NORTHEST, APRIL'S FLOWERS HAVE PETALS OF SNOW 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Winter's inevitable last gasp vanquished the glories
of springtime Sunday. In just 18 hours, temperatures plunged 40
degrees, rain turned to whooshing gusts of snow and much of the
Northeast took on the gloomy, slushy mien of January.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was a balmy spring day, with temperatures in the 70s.
But then a vast, lumbering front, formed along a 1,500-mile arc,
swept eastward across the hard greens at Augusta National and the
Catskills and the Adirondacks. As it passed, waves of cold Canadian
air were sucked in from the rear, and in some places temperatures
fell 20 degrees in a matter of 60 minutes. So Sunday morning, as
snow fell at the rate of 2 inches an hour in Albany, N.Y., it was
still in the 60s in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go from spring to winter in a couple of hours,'' said Fred
Gadomski, a Pennsylvania State University meteorologist.
</P>
<P>
   The heaviest accumulations of snow were in central New York
state, with 17 inches recorded in Schoharie County and more than a
foot in Albany. Around the New York City region, snowfalls ranged
from 1 to 3 inches. Temperatures, which were expected to climb to
the mid-50s Monday and Tuesday, brushed but did not break record
lows.
</P>
<P>
   There were scores of traffic accidents, and many flights were
delayed, but the storm did not pose much threat to public safety.
</P>
<P>
   In a telling measure of the storm's limited impact on New York
City, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani kept up his campaign schedule for the
U.S. Senate. Greeting voters in a Manhattan deli with Sen. John
McCain, Giuliani told reporters that hundreds of trucks were
spreading salt and sand on city roads. ``If you see a sanitation
worker out there working,'' he said, ``why don't you say thank
you.''
</P>
<P>
   No storm-related deaths were reported, but there were scattered
power failures, and clearly the rhythms and rites of spring were
rudely interrupted.
</P>
<P>
   Tulips and daffodils tilted sideways under smothering veils of
wet snow. Hardware stores hastily pulled out dusty stocks of rock
salt and snow shovels. Little League games were canceled, only to
be replaced by snow balls being pitched. Sunday golfers moaned and
groaned, and some cross-country skiers poached on their favorite
fairways.
</P>
<P>
   On the boardwalk in Long Beach, N.Y., Ji Min Kim, 31,
contemplated the possibility of surfing in the falling snow. He had
brought along a friend and novice surfer, Chulsoo Yoo, who smiled
agreeably as if surfing in the snow were perfectly normal. ``This
is his third day,'' Kim said.
</P>
<P>
   Snowstorms in April are routinely described as freak storms, and
for good reason. Only seven times in the last 40 years has Central
Park had a measurable snowfall in April. The last year it happened
was 1996. On Sunday, 1.3 inches fell in the park, the most April
snow there since April 6, 1982, when almost 10 inches fell.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday's snow shocked people all the more because it was an
uncharacteristic exclamation point on an unusually mild winter. New
York City's average daily temperature in March _ 47.2 degrees _ was
the fifth warmest March on record since 1869. For many people,
thoughts of winter had been packed away weeks ago along with gloves
and hats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to believe the forecast,'' Stanley Schultz,
owner of the Ben Frank Variety Store in Williamsburg, Brooklyn,
said.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Joseph Okonski, a 17-year-old from Maspeth, Queens,
peeked out his window and said, ``You've got to be kidding me.''
</P>
<P>
   For some, the transformation was almost dizzying in both its
suddenness and its severity. Many who ventured forth did so with a
look of bewilderment, as if the normal rules of nature had been
rewritten by someone with a warped sense of humor. Even the birds
seemed confused. Hungry robins blindly pecked away at snow-covered
lawns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday my daughter and I were in Sheep's Meadow running
around in the grass with our shoes and socks off,'' said Anne
Ficklen, an editor who lives on the Upper West Side, not far from
Central Park. ``Today we're getting out our snow pants and going
sledding.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Jennifer Pauley was serving double scoops at a Ben
&AMP; Jerry's she manages on Lark Street in Albany. People were lined
up in shorts and T-shirts. But there she was Sunday, gamely
shoveling the sidewalk in front of the store.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Roberts of Brooklyn wore a long, silky summer dress to
the Metropolitan Opera Saturday night. Sunday morning she bundled
up in boots and a heavy parka to walk her German shepherd mix,
Charlotte, who seemed to have the easier time adjusting.
</P>
<P>
   And Gwyn Fletcher, 33, barbecued on Saturday at her parent's
home in Irvington, Westchester County. They cut spring flowers and
pulled out the patio furniture. In other words, she said with a
rueful laugh, it was the perfect time for a snowstorm.
</P>
<P>
   But of course, the big worry was for the flowers _ the pansies
and tulips and magnolias that seemed cruelly out of place in the
snow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost didn't go out, only because I thought it would be so
sad to see all the blossoms die,'' said Kate Combellick, 48, a
Fordham University professor who nevertheless forced herself out
for a jog in Riverside Park in Manhattan. Combellick was
particularly concerned about the magnolias.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry, gardening experts said.
</P>
<P>
   By itself, the snow will do little long-term damage to plants.
In fact, it can be an excellent form of insulation against cold
weather, they said. Some gardening store managers were only upset
that more snow did not fall to provide better protection against
temperatures that were expected to dip to into the mid-30s
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pansies love the snow,'' said George A. Cluff, owner of Eden
Farms, a gardening store in West Milford, N.J. ``And for tulips,
it's actually better that they have snow going into a cold night.''
</P>
<P>
   For gardening stores, the only disaster was at the cash
register. At Rosedale Nurseries in Hawthorne, Westchester County,
manager Toivo Kivisalu said his business was a fraction of what it
was on Saturday. He even sent many of his workers home early.
</P>
<P>
   But there was one small bit of good news. He sold a bundle of
firewood.

ISRAELIS STRUGGLE TO REGAIN STALLED PEACE MOMENTUM 
</HEADLINE>
   By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Late last fall, just when the euphoria that welcomed
Ehud Barak's election as prime minister had faded, Syria decided to
break a nearly four-year stalemate on peace negotiations with
Israel. Barak was back in business, surfing away from the political
and socio-economic headaches that appeared ready to ground him.
</P>
<P>
   Now, four months later, peace with Syria seems a dying prospect
_ although nothing can ever be pronounced officially over in the
volatile Middle East peace efforts _ while Barak's popularity is at
a low, according to polls.
</P>
<P>
   And Barak, a former general who was known for his
single-mindedness, faces widespread criticism for putting too much
energy into Israeli-Syrian peace and not enough into anything else
_ not even Palestinian peace, despite his own self-imposed
deadlines on that track.
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop, Barak will fly to Washington for a
previously unplanned meeting with President Clinton on Tuesday. The
meeting was made public on Saturday night, and on Sunday Barak told
his Cabinet _ the routine message before such meetings _ that no
breakthroughs were to be expected.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear, however, that the Israelis seek to pick up
momentum _ not just for the peace initiatives but also for Barak's
sagging profile on the national stage. Politically, it was time for
Barak, who will stop in Egypt on the way to the United States, to
jet off on an important mission.
</P>
<P>
   That added impetus to a diplomatic agenda about to speed up
anyway: the door to peace with Syria may still be open, but it is
closing; the deadline for a framework agreement with the
Palestinians is in May; the coming troop withdrawal from Lebanon
requires international backing and coordination as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   And the Jewish holiday of Passover, which starts on April 19, is
a slow week in the middle of a hectic preparatory period for a busy
May.
</P>
<P>
   ``The calendar dictated the need,'' said Gadi Baltiansky,
Barak's spokesman. ``May is a very important month. It is the
target date for an agreement with the Palestinians, and also, we
need to get organized on Lebanon. We said we would pull out by
July, but maybe even by next month. Certainly two months, three
months, no more.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House said Clinton and Barak would focus their talks
on the Israeli-Palestinian final status negotiations and on the
withdrawal from Lebanon. But senior Israeli officials said that
they expected Clinton to approach the meeting with Barak _ and then
a subsequent one, nine days later, with Yasser Arafat, the
Palestinian leader _ as he did his failed summit meeting in Geneva
last month with Hafez Assad, the Syrian president.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said in Washington on Sunday
that the initial proposal for the White House meeting came from the
Israelis and that no three-way meeting was contemplated. The two
sides have enough differences remaining, the White House concluded,
that it would be easier to make progress without both leaders in
the same room at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   And a senior Israeli official said: ``Clinton wants to do with
Barak and Arafat what he did with Assad. He wants to say, `Take off
your mask. Will you, Barak, agree to A, B, C _ tell me where you
stand. Will you, Arafat, agree to D, E, F?' He wants to force a
kind of deadline urgency, to bring it to a bottom line: enough
already, is a deal possible or not?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's meeting in Geneva with Assad revealed an impasse that
seemed unbreakable, and the Americans left the next move to Syria.
There were faint indications this weekend that Syrian officials may
still be interested.
</P>
<P>
   First, Farouk al-Sharaa, the Syrian foreign minister, said that
Syria would welcome an Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon, even if it
were unilateral. Previously, Syria had voiced opposition to an
Israeli troop withdrawal that was not part of an Israeli-Syrian
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Patrick Seale, an English journalist who is Assad's
biographer and confidant, put forth a proposal to settle a crucial
difference between the two parties. Speaking on Israel Radio, Seale
said he was acting independently, but some Israeli commentators
reacted as if it were a sign of a softening from Assad himself.
Seale proposed, in effect, that Israel and Syria share the Sea of
Galilee area.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials said they have heard nothing directly from
Syria or through the Americans. But Barak said on Sunday, ``We are
responsible enough, or sensitive or attentive enough not to close
the door completely _ certainly not on our own initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   Chemi Shalev, a columnist for the newspaper Maariv, said that
Barak, ``like every spurned lover,'' would welcome any advance from
Syria. ``The last few days have shown Barak just how empty and
cruel the world can be without Assad, the essence of his term in
office,'' Shalev wrote. ``Barak would be happy to leave behind him
his stumbling coalition and the lame economy and ascend once again
on the wings of history.'' .
</P>
<P>
   It was a busy day of fighting in southern Lebanon on Sunday as
plans for the withdrawal continued apace. The Iran-backed Hezbollah
guerrilla fighters wounded two soldiers from the Israeli-back South
Lebanese Army. Attacks from within the Israeli-controlled security
zone wounded some Lebanese civilians. The guerrillas fired a mortar
shell across the border into Israel, hitting a chicken coop.
Israeli warplanes then struck suspected guerrilla targets.
</P>
<P>
   The violence drew a passionate response from Barak, who used it
to defend the plan for unilateral withdrawal of troops from
Lebanon, which some fear will spark cross-border violence.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian track to peace is no less bumpy. On Sunday,
Arafat dismissed the intensive negotiations that have been going on
in Washington as ``just chat.'' He has said repeatedly that Israel
is proving intransigent and that its negotiators are not empowered
to make big decisions. Israel has said the same of Arafat's
negotiators in the past, although Barak's spokesman on Sunday
characterized the talks as ``quite positive'' and ``very
advanced.''
</P>
<P>
   As to Barak's perceived need to revive his image as a leader,
his spokesman said that Barak does not pay attention to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something that should dictate a leader, his behavior
or his priorities,'' Baltiansky said. ``The mood and the atmosphere
can go up and down very easily and quickly. Barak is not a
magician, he is a statesman. It has been nine months. The
government is not falling down. The government has done a lot of
things.

 &HT;    Hot Bonilla paces bashing
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The New York Mets wanted to get rid of Bobby Bonilla
so much that they agreed to a $29.8-million settlement to get out
of his contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' loss is the Braves' gain.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla, rejuvenated at age 37, homered, singled twice and drove
in three runs Sunday as the Braves beat the San Francisco Giants
9-3.
</P>
<P>
   The victory gave Atlanta a 4-2 record for their opening
homestand and sent them off to Chicago in first place in the
National League East.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Rafael Furcal, the youngest player in the majors at 19,
stole home on a double steal and Tom Glavine retired the last 11
batters he faced in a gutsy seven-inning effort. But the story on
Sunday was Bonilla.
</P>
<P>
   With Brian Jordan on the disabled list, Bonilla got his third
start in a row in left field in his biggest game in three years.
</P>
<P>
   His second homer of the season broke a tie at 2 in the fifth
inning. Then he broke the game open with a two-run single in the
sixth. In going 3-for-3, Bonilla raised his average to .429.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having fun again,'' Bonilla said. ``This is a great
opportunity for me and I want to take advantage of it. I know my
role here. I'll do what I can until Brian gets back, then I'll just
help any way I can. I want to win. That's all I care about now.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla, who ballooned to more than 250 pounds last season, will
collect his deferred money from the Mets over 24 years beginning in
2011. Until then, he'd just as soon forget his time in New York.
Injuries limited him to 60 games in 1999, and he hit only .160 in
119 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to call last year,'' said Bonilla, paid the
major-league minium of $200,000 by the Braves. ``I hope my
nightmares aren't that bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, out with a strained rib cage, will be eligible to come
off the disabled list on April 19. Until then, Bonilla should see
plenty of time in left field, with Reggie Sanders moving to right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby is swinging the bat as well as I've seen him in three or
four years,'' Glavine said. ``He's been a very good pickup. It's a
big luxury when you can put a player like Brian on the DL and call
on someone like Bobby.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bonilla provided the power, Furcal supplied the speed. In
his third start on the homestand, Furcal went 2-for-4 with a triple
and stole his second and third bases of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That little Pee Wee Herman kid kicked our butt,'' the Giants'
Barry Bonds said of the smallish Furcal.

YOU RULE _ AT LEAST WITH THESE BOOKS NEARBY

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Book I: ``Baseball America 2000 Almanac'' ($12.95,
416 pages, edited by Paul White)
</P>
<P>
   Book II: ``Baseball Weekly 2000 Almanac'' ($14.95, 444 pages,
edited by Alan Simpson)
</P>
<P>
   Book III: ``2000 Official Rules of Major League Baseball''
(Triumph Books, 201 pages, $8.95)
</P>
<P>
   Why they're essential: As great as the Internet is for instant
reference material, not all of us have Powerbooks with cordless
modems. We need books once in a while. For baseball, these three do
it.
</P>
<P>
   If any two almanacs could look the same but be completely
different, it's these two. Baseball America can't be touched for
its in-depth coverage of the minor leagues, college, high school
and even youth, amateur, foreign and winter leagues. After that,
Baseball Weekly, with help from stepbrother USA Today, goes much
more into detailed graphics and stats on major-league info, past
and present, including listing the final '99 statistics
alphabetically by position a must for fantasy-leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, who hasn't been confused by a rule but can't find a
book that explains it, not just to the letter but how the
rulemakers intended for it to be applied? This official MLB
publication clears away the confusion and includes unique
interpretations of particular rules as determined by the Rules
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   For example, did you know that Rule 1.04 on The Playing Field
says that ``it is desirable that the line from home plate through
the pitchers plate to second base shall run East-Northeast.'' Is
that why left-handers are called ``southpaws''? We never were good
with a compass.
</P>
<P>
   It also offers the latest rule revisions to readers who send a
self-addressed, stamped envelope to the publishers.

IN STUNNING REVERSAL, PERU'S PRESIDENT NOW FACES RUN-OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ In a stunning reversal of political fortunes,
President Alberto K. Fujimori appeared to fall well short of
winning a first-round re-election victory Sunday and ended in a
virtual tie with Alejandro Toledo, a business school professor who
was given no chance of winning as little as five weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   After a campaign riddled by irregularities, Fujimori had been
almost uniformly viewed as a sure winner, as dirty tricks and smear
tactics crippled one opponent after another. But an international
outcry over what appeared to be a systematic attempt to steal the
vote peeled support from the president at an accelerating rate in
the final 10 days of the race, pollsters said.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori, consistently popular, is seeking an unprecedented
third term after a tumultuous decade in which he defeated two
terrorist insurrections and ended years of hyperinflation in this
Andean country.
</P>
<P>
   But Toledo managed to capitalize on the disaffection the
campaign had created, as well as unhappiness over the economy and
the appeal of his own personal story as a one-time shoeshine boy
who rose from poverty in a family of 16 children.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a virtual tie Sunday, with surveys of voters
leaving the polls showing 45.2 percent for Toledo and 43.6 percent
for Fujimori, and the need to hold a run-off by the first week of
June.
</P>
<P>
   That outcome was privately viewed by the Clinton administration
and Organization of American States as the best possible to assure
the political standing and economic stability of a country that has
been a strong American ally in combating insurgencies and drug
trade in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Fears of a fraudulent victory by Fujimori, foreign diplomats
here said, opened the possibility that the Organization of American
States would rule that the election did not meet international
standards and withdraw recognition of the Lima government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite all the irregularities, the people have spoken,''
Toledo, looking relaxed wearing faded jeans and a green work shirt,
said in a formal appearance before reporters. ``We celebrate the
fiesta of democracy.'' But he added that he wanted to wait for
official results to make a detailed statement. Fujimori had no
immediate public comments.
</P>
<P>
   A centrist, Toledo campaigned promising to strengthen the powers
of local government, make the court system independent of
presidential influence and use tax incentives to bolster
agribusiness as a way to boost exports and create jobs.
</P>
<P>
   With his strong Indian facial features, he was able to tap into
the large urban population of mestizos, as people of mixed
Indian-Latino race are known, and offer himself as an example of
what a poor son of a bricklayer and street market fish saleswoman
can do with an education.
</P>
<P>
   Several television networks broadcast the results, as well as
exit polls showing that Fujimori had lost control of Congress.
Fujimori's coalition, Peru 2000, won the largest bloc of
congressional votes, but two-thirds of the seats will be divided
among several opposition groups.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Polls indicated that Fujimori was able to cling to his rural
Indian voter base with a campaign that promised to continue tough
policies that would prevent future terrorism and a broadening of
milk and cereal handouts to ease hunger in Andean and jungle
villages. He had also promised to extend lunch programs and
computer classes to schools across the country and build more roads
connecting the provincial hinterlands, while he handed out hundreds
of thousands of land titles to landless peasants.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori sometimes appeared to be a reluctant candidate who was
pushed into the race by eager aides, especially his intelligence
chief Vladimiro Montesinos, concerned about losing their jobs or
future prosecution for corruption. He campaigned in earnest with
only two weeks left before the election, and he frequently appeared
to be going through the motions while on the stump.
</P>
<P>
   In the last days of the campaign, however, Fujimori appeared to
be animated again. He donned Indian costumes and danced on
platforms across the country. The pace of his rallies _ some days
staging well-orchestrated rallies in several desert cities along
the coast and high altitude Andean provincial capitals within hours
_ amazed even his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   He also began airing an effective barrage of television and
radio commercials arguing that now that he had defeated terrorism
and hyperinflation and made peace with neighboring Ecuador, he was
ready to roll up sleeves and attack the problem of unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   But Fujimori was dogged by a scandal amply documented by the
newspaper El Comercio involving campaign workers who forged 1
million signatures to get him on the ballot. The mounting evidence
forced several election officials and congressional candidates
allied with Fujimori to resign, and gave the impression that the
president had lost control over what was once thought to be a
well-oiled political machine.
</P>
<P>
   He was also hurt by steady criticism that he had replaced judges
and manipulated the Congress in order to run for an unprecedented
third five-year term despite a constitutional ban.
</P>
<P>
   In the final days of the campaign, the Organization of American
States observer team released a report expressing concerns that
systematic campaign irregularities had ``impeded the citizenry from
having the confidence that sufficient conditions exist for the
exercise of effective democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo, a former World Bank official with a Stanford Ph.D. and a
Belgian-born naturalized American wife, was the surprise of the
election. After running a poor third in the 1995 presidential
election, he was not expected to be a threat this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Toledo surged sharply in the last five weeks of the campaign
after the candidacies of two other candidates were destroyed by a
series of vicious personal attack campaigns appearing in the
leading television networks and tabloid newspapers that were
believed to be directed by Fujimori's intelligence service.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two weeks of the campaign, the smears were directed
at Toledo, but pollsters said they did not seem to have the same
impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demolition machine just ran out of steam,'' said Santiago
Pedraglio, a political columnist for the daily Gestion. ``The
element of surprise and credibility were gone.'' Pedraglio
predicted that it would be hard for Fujimori to recover in a second
round because ``he will no longer be viewed as the figure on the
top of Mount Olympus.''
</P>
<P>
   Police vans equipped with water cannons patrolled the streets of
Lima, but there were no reports of serious violence.
</P>
<P>
   But there were reports of electoral computer glitches and at
least sporadic vote fraud from across the country throughout the
day, including instances of convicts voting, ballots filled in
before they were given to voters and people voting with false
documentation presumably to cast their ballots more than once.
</P>
<P>
   Most common were reports of ballots distributed with the name of
Toledo, the leading opposition candidate, cut from voting sheets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is outrageous fraud being committed,'' Toledo declared
on a national radio network when he voted at midday. He said
electoral authorities were confiscating and hiding evidence of
fraudulent ballots after complaints had been filed, adding, ``I
plead that they stop dirtying this process.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Teresa Gonzalez de Fanning School in the lower-middle
class Lima neighborhood of Jesus Maria, dozens of voters
insistently chanted ``fraud, fraud, fraud'' in a spontaneous
demonstration before television cameras while election observers
complained to election officials that Toledo's name had been cut
from the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just too much,'' said Cesar Cary, a 62-year-old
handyman after he voted at the school. ``It's mortifying for the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, observers said, Toledo's support was too great and
the international scrutiny of the vote too daunting for the
government to perpetrate fraud on a scale that would have been
needed for Fujimori to win.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The pharmaceutical industry has a lot of problems
in Washington these days, its prices and profits proving an
irresistible target for politicians with hard-pressed elderly
constituents and an election on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   But there are few more persistent irritants than Rep. Bernard
Sanders, the democratic socialist from Vermont who is one of two
independents in the House. Sanders, a gruff-spoken 58-year-old
native of the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, with a thatch of white
hair and a rumpled '60s-academic style, has twice taken elderly
constituents on well-publicized trips to Canada to buy prescription
drugs, highlighting the lower prices across the border.
</P>
<P>
   He has pushed legislation that he said would allow American
pharmacists and distributors to ``reimport'' prescription drugs
from Canada and Mexico and sell them at lower costs.
</P>
<P>
   When a lobbying alliance backed by the pharmaceutical industry
set up a Web site last month to highlight the problems in the
Canadian health system (www.busfromcanada.org), Sanders quickly
countered with a Web site about the inequities of American drug
pricing and the legislative proposals to deal with them
(bernie.house.gov/bustocanada).
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Thursday night, just after he left the floor
of the House where he had been railing one more time against the
industry, Sanders had the quiet glow of a man who believes that
political lightning is finally striking his cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're dealing here not just with an economic issue or even a
health care issue, you're dealing with a very profound moral
issue,'' he said. ``Time is long overdue for the Congress to stand
up to these people and protect the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Cottrell, a spokeswoman for the Pharmaceutical Research
and Manufacturers of America, responded, ``What's moral is to make
sure medicines are available through insurance coverage, but also
to make sure that Congressman Sanders and his allies don't stifle
our ability to invent medicines that help and heal.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders has focused on this issue since the 1980s when he was
the mayor of Burlington, Vt., and created a task force on health
care. Medicare, the health program for the elderly, generally does
not cover outpatient prescription drugs, and a third of its elderly
beneficiaries have no drug coverage at all. ``You can't walk down a
main street in Vermont without someone coming up and saying,
`Bernie, you've got to do something about the high cost of
prescription drugs,''' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These days, of course, nearly every one says they want to do
something to help the elderly with drug costs, but Sanders stands
out. He believes not only in new prescription drug coverage for the
elderly, and not only in finding a way to end what he considers
price discrimination against American consumers, but in a publicly
financed national health insurance program _ a Canadian-style
system, administered by the states _ for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   He does not seem to worry much about the drug industry's
arguments that its prices in the United States are necessary to
cover the cost of research. He said he met with some industry
lobbyists last year and remembers that they were wearing ``fancy
shoes.'' He spoke not with irony but _ to use his word _ with
``contempt.''
</P>
<P>
   In an age of careful centrism, there is an archaic quality to
Sanders' political speech, not to mention a razor's edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what it's like to live in a family without any money,''
he said, ``the economic suffering that is totally unnecessary''
among the uninsured, the working poor and many of the elderly. His
father, who emigrated from Poland at the age of 17, was a paint
salesman. ``He worked very hard. He never made a lot of money,''
Sanders said in a quick staccato, his eyes focused on the floor.
``Lack of money was a constant stress on my parents relationship
and in our household.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders' only sibling, a brother, became a social worker.
Sanders himself, after a year at Brooklyn College, went to the
University of Chicago on a combination of loans, grants and
part-time jobs. He was a lackluster student, he wrote in his
autobiography, but ``learned a lot more from my out-of-class
activities'' in groups like the Congress on Racial Equality and the
Young People's Socialist League.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to Vermont in the late 1960s, working at a mixture of
state government, carpentry and writing jobs, and ultimately ended
up in politics. Initially, he had little success, but he was
elected mayor of Burlington from 1981 to 1989, and in 1990 won
Vermont's only House seat, the first independent elected to
Congress in 40 years. Sanders has four children, and his wife, Jane
O'Meara Sanders, has been a key adviser in his political career.
</P>
<P>
   While he tends to align with the Democrats, he said he never
considered becoming one. Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``Both major political parties are heavily influenced by big
money,'' he said. He noted that in nine years in Congress, he has
spent one weekend in Washington. He talked scornfully of the
journalists and the politicians who spend their time talking to one
another, with ``no sense of what's going on in the real world.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders clearly feels he has the drug industry on the defensive.
``What I try to do here is not to be an ideologue, but to talk
issues,'' he said. ``And when you talk issues, people respond
positively.'' Still, he acknowledges, ``I sometimes scratch my head
that somebody like me ever made it to the U.S. Congress.''

HERSHISER TO START DODGERS' HOME OPENER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK - Mother Nature and the injury bug did what the Dodgers
couldn't do. Because of the April snowstorm in the Northeast, and
the injury to Kevin Brown, the Dodgers shuffled around their
pitching rotation to create perhaps one of those never-to-forget
moments.
</P>
<P>
   Orel Hershiser, the Dodgers icon who stirred old-time emotion
when he signed with the club last December, will mark his return to
Dodger Stadium by starting the Dodgers' home opener Friday against
the Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He certainly deserves that,'' said Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson, who made the announcement with a smile. ``I want to see
it. I just want to see his name up there (on the scoreboard) and
him walk to the mound on opening day at Dodger Stadium. It'll be
special for me and special for him and a lot of fans.''
</P>
<P>
   The naming of Hershiser as the pitcher for the home opener
brought an additional chill to a day filled with shivers. Sunday's
game between the Mets and Dodgers was snowed out. It will be made
up April 24 at Shea Stadium at 7:10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's significant to what he's meant to the organization and
how important he's been to the history of this organization,'' said
first baseman Eric Karros, the Dodger with the most tenure. ``It's
fitting he'll open a (renovated) stadium under new ownership. It
should be a good day.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in spring training the Dodgers talked about setting up
their rotation to allow Hershiser to pitch a nostalgic home opener.
But Hershiser said he balked at the idea because he didn't want the
rotation manipulated on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   But when Brown suffered a broken right pinkie in Saturday's 6-5
10-inning win against the Mets, most likely knocking him out three
to four weeks, the Dodgers had to alter plans. Hershiser was
initially slated to start the inaugural game at Pac Bell Park
against San Francisco on Tuesday, but that's changed.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Chan Ho Park will pitch Tuesday, followed by Darren
Dreifort. The Dodgers are yet to announce a starter for Thursday's
series finale, but it's expected to be lefty Jeff Williams.
Hershiser pitches Friday against the Reds, and a starter isn't
named for Saturday, but Eric Gagne is the favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sentimentally, Dodger Stadium renovated, year 2000, back as a
Dodger, it will be fun,'' Hershiser said. ``When they approached me
about it (in spring training), I didn't want to do it. With
Brownie, somebody, or everybody, was going to get pushed back. So
why not me?''
</P>
<P>
   However, the circumstances in which Hershiser's been thrust into
the opening-day limelight isn't what the Dodgers need.
</P>
<P>
   Williams and Gagne, who allowed one hit in six innings for
Triple-A Albuquerque on Saturday, are teammates with the Dukes and
are only being called upon because of the injury to Brown and one
to Gregg Olson. The latter two are expected to be placed on the
disabled list before Tuesday's game in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Olson has a strain in his right forearm and Brown broke his
right pinkie. Brown is scheduled to see Dr. Norman Zemel, a hand
specialist, today in Los Angeles. Brown said he wants to continue
to pitch if the injury won't create long-term problems, but the
Dodgers don't want it to come to that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about impossible (for Brown to pitch hurt),'' Johnson
said. ``I wouldn't even chance it. But in deference to him, I'm
going to let him see the doctor and then make a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss of the durable Brown, who's thrown 979 innings the last
four seasons, is a crushing blow to the Dodgers, but players and
coaches are talking otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort and Park are the two who will need to carry most of the
load to keep the Dodgers in contention until Brown returns.
Greatness has been forecast for Park and Dreifort, both in the
early part of developing as starters, but neither has delivered in
the big way expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get production out of everybody, whether Brownie
gets hurt or not,'' Dodgers pitching coach Claude Osteen said.
``Those guys are capable of doing that. It's hard to lose Brownie
because he's such an anchor man, but when they go out to pitch,
there's nobody that can hold their hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always pressure, but it shouldn't cause Chan Ho to
lose focus on what he's trying to do. He has his work cut out with
or without Brown. Same with Dreifort.''

SOCIALIST PRIME MINISTER WINS NARROW RE-ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece _ In a harrowingly close vote that showed more
indecision than clear favor, Greek voters on Sunday re-elected the
Socialist prime minister, Costas Simitis, a reserved technocrat who
brought the faltering Greek economy into line with the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
   Simitis' mandate was jolted by Costas Karamanlis, leader of the
New Democracy Party, a fresh, but untested politician who tapped
into voters' thirst for change.
</P>
<P>
   With 90 percent of the vote counted, Simitis' party, the
Panhellenic Socialist Movement, or PASOK, was ahead by less than 1
percentage point, about 30,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
   After a long, emotional roller coaster of a night, a smiling
Simitis, 64, arrived at the central election headquarters at 1:45
a.m. as fireworks in the green-and-white PASOK colors went off in
the sky. He claimed a victory that he described as ``greater than
the numbers.'' He committed himself to work for stability and
greater prosperity for all Greeks and called for an end to
political differences.
</P>
<P>
   The first partial exit polls projected that the conservative New
Democracy Party was ahead by 1 percentage point, which drove
supporters and even some party leaders to predict a premature
victory.
</P>
<P>
   The waves of excitement and crashing disappointment so whipped
up supporters of both candidates in Salonika, where Karamanlis'
district is situated, that the riot police were called in to
separate the two fevered crowds.
</P>
<P>
   The results were clearly not the ringing endorsement Simitis
sought when he called early elections. But the dead heat also
reflected an unprecedented absence of deep ideological differences.
Karamanlis, 43, espoused the same pragmatic path taken by his rival
_ fiscal restraint to meet European prerequisites for inclusion in
the European currency, the Euro, and rapprochement with Greece's
historic enemy, Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   In a concession speech given at 2:30 a.m., Karamanlis referred
to the new leverage his party won in the close race. ``It's obvious
the government cannot proceed without our consent,'' he said. ``Our
battle for a better Greece continues.''
</P>
<P>
   Voting is compulsory in Greece, and turnout among the 9 million
registered voters was close to 75 percent. Under Greece's system,
the party that gets the largest percentage of the vote is assured
of a parliamentary majority.
</P>
<P>
   Voters weighed Simitis' proven, stolid experience against their
yearning for new blood after nearly 20 years of PASOK rule,
interrupted only by a fragile New Democracy government from 1990 to
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Many voters who supported Simitis simultaneously expressed
disenchantment with his party, PASOK, whose longevity in power bred
corruption and inertia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was tempted until the last minute to vote for a new face,
but in the end I chose the interests of the country,'' Konduvas
Constantinos, 39, said after voting in an elementary school in
central Athens. ``Greek membership in the Euro is very important,
and when the future is uncertain, it's hard to choose someone who
is also uncertain. I prefer a more experienced leader, even if I am
a bit tired of PASOK.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the Greek economy fell embarrassingly short of
the European Union's minimum standards for membership in the Euro.
Greece has since caught up, and is almost certain to be included in
the Euro next January. But that also proved a liability, since few
voters said they felt Greece's inclusion remained at risk, and many
complained about the punishing effects of the government's fiscal
austerity.
</P>
<P>
   Greek voters, who only recently _ and unevenly _ began feeling
the benefits of economic growth, now at 3.5 percent, had to decide
whether to entrust their fragile stability to a promising, but
inexperienced newcomer.
</P>
<P>
   Karamanlis, a lawyer who got his doctorate degree at the
Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in
Massachusetts in 1985, ran an energetic, skillful campaign, but he
is chiefly known as the nephew and namesake of Constantine
Karamanlis, the founder of New Democracy and a former president and
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Many Greek voters warmed to his gregarious, exuberant campaign
style, which contrasted with the incumbent's stolid diffidence.
</P>
<P>
   Simitis, an academic who was driven into exile by the military
junta that ruled Greece between 1967 and 1974, was a co-founder of
his party. Since he took office in 1996, he has moved the party
sharply away from its anti-NATO, anti-European, anti-capitalist
roots. Like Tony Blair with his ``new Labor'' in Britain, he
represents a ``new PASOK,'' carefully aimed at the center. That
shift alienated old party loyalists, even as it attracted younger
independent voters.
</P>
<P>
   The vote count was hair-raising, but the nine-week campaign was
bland by Greek standards, which in itself marked a significant
change from the past. ``This is the first time since World War II
that the U.S. was not an issue in the campaign,'' said the American
ambassador, Nicholas Burns. ``Its also the first campaign since
1965 that hasn't been marked by a huge ideological chasm.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, the battle was over social issues. Karamanlis sought to
exploit ordinary people's discontent over unemployment, which is
now at 11 percent, bloated and inefficient social services, and
antiquated state monopolies.

COMPANY ANNOUNCES ADVANCES IN TESTING MEDICAL MARIJUANA 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   IOWA CITY, Iowa _ By cultivating marijuana and testing the most
promising of its more than 100 ingredients, a British
pharmaceutical company hopes to develop drugs for a variety of
ailments, a company official told the first national conference for
health professionals about the medical uses of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   The privately owned company, GW Pharmaceuticals Ltd. of
Salisbury, England, is ``trying to turn an illegal plant into a
pharmaceutically regulated product'' by developing cannabis-based
medicines that are not smoked, Dr. David C. Hadorn, the company's
North American medical director, said.
</P>
<P>
   GW is studying what it believes will be the most promising
ingredients of marijuana in a structured research program.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the British government approved the
company's plans to advance to the next stage of testing, for
effectiveness, among people with multiple sclerosis, spinal cord
injury and other conditions that produce severe pain and muscle
spasms. Six healthy volunteers had earlier taken four different
preparations several times over a period of several weeks in the
earliest phase of testing, for safety.
</P>
<P>
   Full-scale testing will eventually involve about 2,000 patients
in England, Canada and the United States, and the hope is to
develop a licensed product by 2003, Hadorn said.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Iowa's colleges of nursing and medicine
sponsored the two-day conference to help health care professionals
and providers learn how to obtain and properly use medical
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Melanie C. Dreher, the nursing school's dean, said the
conference was needed because thousands of Americans use marijuana
medically even though it is illegal in most states. Voters in at
least seven states (Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada,
Oregon and Washington) have approved initiatives intended to make
marijuana legal for medical purposes. But many doctors are afraid
to recommend it because the federal government has threatened to
prosecute them.
</P>
<P>
   Dreher, who has researched marijuana use for many years, spoke
in an interview of a nurse's experience with the father of a man
with cancer. The father told the nurse that marijuana had eased his
son's nausea and pain at home. Taking the hint, the nurse rigged
the son's intravenous tubing to a wheelchair to allow them to go
off while the son smoked a marijuana cigarette. The therapy allowed
the son a more comfortable death.
</P>
<P>
   All drugs have both potential hazards and benefits. But a
critical problem in the case of marijuana is that doctors and
nurses have not been trained in its medical use.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge is to quit using illegality as an excuse not to
discuss medical marijuana,'' said Mary Lynn Mathre, an addictions
nurse at the University of Virginia and co-director of the Iowa
conference.
</P>
<P>
   With her husband, Al Byrne, Mathre founded Patients Out of Time,
a nonprofit group based in Virginia that promotes the legal use of
medical marijuana and that helped organize the conference.
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association supported the conference by
awarding doctor participants credits toward their continuing
education.
</P>
<P>
   No government officials were among the 250 patients, doctors,
nurses and lawyers who attended the conference here and at
telecasts in seven medical centers in the United States and Canada.
Dr. David Satcher, the surgeon general of the Public Health
Service, declined an invitation, Mathre said.
</P>
<P>
   In a government-commissioned study a year ago, the Institute of
Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences said that some of the
ingredients in marijuana were potentially effective in treating
pain, nausea and severe weight loss from AIDS. The institute also
urged rigorous testing of marijuana for other ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Hadorn of GW Pharmaceuticals said his company was concentrating
on eight principal ingredients of marijuana. The amount of these
ingredients, which are members of the cannabinoid group, varies in
each naturally grown plant. To standardize the amounts, GW has
cloned, cultivated and harvested tens of thousands of marijuana
plants in a greenhouse at a secret location in England.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the only people in the world licensed to grow
pharmaceutical grade cannabis,'' Dr. Geoffrey Guy, who founded GW
Pharmaceuticals in December 1997, said in a telephone interview
Sunday. The National Institute on Drug Abuse in the United States
grows marijuana, he added, but the marijuana is not standardized
for pharmaceutical grade.
</P>
<P>
   By cultivating cannabis under highly controlled indoor
conditions, GW hopes to satisfy criteria set by the Food and Drug
Administration and similar governmental agencies worldwide so it
can eventually market the most effective combination of ingredients
as prescription drugs. Guy estimated that it would cost at least
$16 million to market the first marijuana product.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid the dangers associated with smoking, GW Pharmaceuticals
aims to develop nonsmoke delivery systems like inhalers and
nebulizers. The company is starting with products that are absorbed
after being sprayed under the tongue and is initially concentrating
on the components known as THC and CBD, Hadorn said.
</P>
<P>
   GW Pharmaceuticals hopes to start testing a small number of
people in the United States later this year, Guy said. The company
has held discussions with all appropriate American agencies, but
Guy declined to say where the tests would be conducted.

JACKSON DOESN'T THINK SHAQ'S INJURY WILL LINGER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT MAGOLOFF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO - Shaquille O'Neal's left ankle has attracted more
attention these last few days than his Madison Avenue smile or
widely publicized struggles at the foul line ever did. After
missing Friday's practice and Saturday's 98-80 loss to San Antonio,
the league's leading scorer and second-leading rebounder sat out
Sunday's light practice as well.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal sprained the ankle during Wednesday's victory over Golden
State and will be re-evaluated before tonight's game against
potential first-round playoff opponent Seattle. The Sonics beat the
Lakers 82-81 at Staples Center on Jan. 17 in the teams' only L.A.
encounter this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see what it's like tomorrow,'' said coach Phil Jackson,
who added that it was ``better.'' Jackson also said he did not
expect it to be a lingering problem.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, who did not talk to reporters, received treatment during
the shootaround. Point guard Derek Fisher said O'Neal - the last
player remaining at the training facility - was being administered
hydrotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Despite there being only five games left in the regular season,
Jackson is not about to get stressed over O'Neal's condition. At
least, not yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose if you just had a couple of games left in the
season, that would be enough time,'' Jackson said. ``Two or three
games would probably be the minimum a player would have to play to
get something back again.''
</P>
<P>
   Time is on O'Neal's side. The Lakers have three days off after
tonight's game until they meet Sacramento, another potential
first-round opponent, on Friday at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Big void: The numbers don't lie. Without O'Neal, the Spurs
limited Los Angeles to season lows in points (80) and shooting
percentage (31.6) on Saturday, a day when the Lakers lost for the
first time in 12 games and second time in 32.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant took a career-high 30 shots but made only 12.
Jackson wasn't concerned, however, saying the team's inconsistent
effort was more of a factor in the sluggish offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sideline triangle was once called the triple-post offense
because you can use so many people in the post,'' Jackson said.
``The reality is, we used Michael in the post a zillion times in
Chicago. It's whoever gets to that post first, and the player that
wants to go in there has the free right to go in there. And that's
what happened (with Bryant on Saturday).''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant said he did not put any extra pressure on himself to
produce in O'Neal's absence. He instead pointed out the lackluster
defensive effort and the team's lack of opportunities to practice
an offense sans O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good film session (Sunday) actually,'' Bryant said.
``We went over the things we need to do. It was good for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Downplayed: The Lakers are 2-1 this year against Seattle, which
has won only twice in its last 10 games. Despite the potential
playoff ramifications and the maintenance of the team's confidence
heading into the second season, Jackson downplayed tonight's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not be ultimately important at all,'' Jackson said.
``Who knows how important it's going to be. The reality is, it's a
game and it's (today) and we want to play and we want to give a
good effort and we want to play better than we did Saturday.''

RAPE OF MEXICAN TEEN-AGER STIRS ABORTION OUTCRY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICALI, Mexico _ More than a year ahead of time, Paulina
Ramirez Jacinta planned on a long organdy dress, a live dance band
and a skyscraper cake for her 15th birthday party, the pinnacle
event for a teen-age girl in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Those plans ended on the night of last July 31, when a drunken
housebreaker ransacked her family's simple home and then, almost as
an afterthought, decided that he would rape her.
</P>
<P>
   Given the girl's age, her mother did not imagine that Paulina
would become pregnant. As soon as they received the news from a
family doctor, mother and daughter felt certain about what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it just wasn't possible for my daughter to have a
child by a man whose name we didn't even know,'' the mother, Maria
Elena Jacinta, 45, said as she twisted a handkerchief anxiously,
with Paulina sitting close by her side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I might hate the baby,'' she added, ``and that my
daughter might not love it. I couldn't bear the idea of seeing her
in this condition. She's still a little girl.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This condition'' is Paulina's ninth month of pregnancy. Though
they wanted an abortion, which is legal for rape victims in this
state on the border with California, they abandoned the idea after
weeks of confrontations with senior state officials, who believe
that abortion is a taking of life. Paulina plans to have the baby
on April 14.
</P>
<P>
   No official ever refused her the abortion, but they counseled
her against it so openly and forcefully that she and her family
became frightened and desisted.
</P>
<P>
   The case has become a cause among feminist groups and some
prominent intellectuals in Mexico, where abortion is outlawed, with
few exceptions, as well as being shunned by the medical
establishment and condemned by the Catholic Church. It is normally
practiced in an underground where as many as half a million women
terminate pregnancies clandestinely each year.
</P>
<P>
   The voices that dissuaded Paulina from an abortion are
especially influential in her home state of Baja California, where
a socially conservative party with Catholic roots has been in power
for 11 years in Mexico's longest-running experiment in opposition
rule.
</P>
<P>
   That group, the National Action Party or PAN, and its candidate,
Vicente Fox Quesada, have a better chance of winning the
presidential election on July 2 than any opposition contenders in
Mexico's modern history. And Paulina's story could portend a
broader shift in social values in Mexico if the PAN takes power
from the strongly secular Institutional Revolutionary Party, the
PRI, which has controlled the country for seven decades.
</P>
<P>
   The office of the Baja California human rights prosecutor, an
independent agency, ruled in March that Paulina's rights had been
violated by the government's failure to carry out the abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The conduct of Paulina's case ``was dominated by the ethical
preferences of the officials involved,'' said the human rights
official, Antonio Garcia Sanchez. He called on the state to set up
a long-term fund to care for her and her child.
</P>
<P>
   The PAN governor, Alejandro Gonzalez Alcocer, rejected the
finding in a curt statement on the grounds that the family had
never lodged a formal legal complaint.
</P>
<P>
   State officials have offered to assist Paulina only if she will
give the baby up for adoption, which her family is reluctant to do.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, with clinics where an abortion could have
been performed more routinely, is only a few miles from the
family's home. But Maria Elena Jacinta, who has barely scraped by
while raising eight children in all, did not have the money for her
daughter to go.
</P>
<P>
   Under the laws of Baja California, Paulina, as a rape victim,
could have had an abortion legally in her first trimester. In 1998,
anti-abortion groups, with the support of the PAN, campaigned to
ban all abortions and specify that life begins at conception. But
the state legislature did not pass the measure.
</P>
<P>
   So middle-level state justice officials authorized the
procedure, but they decreed that it had to be performed in a
state-run institution. In early October Paulina was admitted to the
General Hospital in Mexicali, the poor people's hospital. Although
she was in good health, she remained confined to bed for a week.
</P>
<P>
   The chief obstetrician, Dr. Fernando Garza, refused to perform
an abortion. When the hospital director, Dr. Ismael Avila Iniguez,
told him that it had been ordered by the authorities, Garza
resigned.
</P>
<P>
   ``He believed that abortion was killing,'' Avila said. Avila
acknowledged that he shared Garza's belief, but for the hospital
director his colleague's decision was a matter of medical training
rather than religious faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Mexico our medical schools, which transmit our professional
ethics to us, tell us that we are supposed to preserve and prolong
life, not take it away,'' Avila said. ``We are told that we should
not perform abortions. Period.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he recognized that he had to comply with the state
order for the operation. But one after another, the surgeons on
Avila's staff refused to perform the abortion.
</P>
<P>
   As the doctors' dispute raged on, Paulina sat in bed. At one
point, two women visited her, saying they were state social workers
sent by the hospital director. She recalled that they had shown her
a videotape of pictures of aborted fetuses and warned her that she
risked excommunication from the Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want anyone to see me,'' Paulina said. ``I just
wanted them to leave me alone. I was very upset, and so I just kept
quiet and hung my head.'' The social work agency later denied that
any of its staff members had ever seen Paulina in the hospital, and
the identity of the visitors remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   After a week Avila sent Paulina home. Her mother immediately
took her to see Attorney General Juan Manuel Salazar Pimentel, the
state's highest justice official. She wanted his personal order for
the abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Salazar declined to be interviewed about the case, saying he did
not wish to fuel the controversy. But his spokeswoman, Luisa Sofia
Buerba, confirmed the details of his meeting with Maria Elena
Jacinta and her daughter as they recounted it.
</P>
<P>
   In his imposing office, Salazar, who was appointed by the PAN
governor, tried to talk them out of the procedure. As attorney
general he spent much of his professional life handling cases of
people he could not help because they were already dead. In
Paulina's case he apparently felt that he could save a life, that
of her unborn child.
</P>
<P>
   Although she felt awed by the high official, Paulina spoke up to
insist that she wanted to end her pregnancy. She said the attorney
general responded, ``How can you do that to your own blood?''
</P>
<P>
   Over protests from Maria Elena Jacinta, Salazar put mother and
daughter into his car and drove them, with a car full of his
regular bodyguards close behind, to his church. He sat with them
through Mass and then left them alone with the priest, who reminded
them that the Catholic Church views abortion as a sin.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are in this much pain, you forget a lot of things you
learned in church,'' Paulina's mother told the priest. ``Even
though the pope does not agree, if I do not do anything cruel, why
shouldn't God forgive me?''
</P>
<P>
   In the end Salazar, seeing that Paulina's mother would not
change her mind, reluctantly signed a new order for the abortion.
He went one step further, summoning Avila to explain what had held
it up.
</P>
<P>
   That pressure moved Avila to recruit a surgeon from outside the
hospital and schedule the procedure. But on Oct. 9, minutes before
the abortion was to begin, Avila gave Paulina's mother an account
for the first time of the risks involved. Paulina could suffer a
fatal hemorrhage, Avila said, or be left sterile.
</P>
<P>
   Reeling, the mother refused to sign the authorization. The
abortion was canceled. ``I thought it was better for my daughter to
have the baby than to die,'' she said. ``Probably nothing would
happen to her, but if everyone was so angry about the operation,
maybe the doctors would do it badly on purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Paulina and her family went home feeling cheated, as well as
overwhelmed by more than $1,500 in medical costs they could not
pay. Their debts will double with the Caesarean section that
Paulina is to undergo on April 14.
</P>
<P>
   On April 6 several dozen Mexican intellectuals, including the
novelists Carlos Fuentes and Laura Esquivel, signed an open letter
in Mexico City newspapers calling on Gonzalez to accept the human
rights prosecutor's recommendation to indemnify Paulina.
</P>
<P>
   None of Paulina's three older sisters received the grand bash
that Paulina had envisioned for her 15th birthday in September,
because the family could not afford it. Now, Maria Elena Jacinta
said she feared that ``it wouldn't look right'' for her daughter to
celebrate while nursing an infant.
</P>
<P>
   But Paulina said, ``I just want my party, even with a short
dress.'' And for the first time in retelling her ordeal, she began
to cry.

RANGERS END BITTER SEASON WITH FAMILIAR REFRAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By JASON DIAMOS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With five minutes remaining in the Rangers' season,
the crowd at Madison Square Garden cranked up a new chant:
``Refund! Refund!''
</P>
<P>
   The team's ownership, which spent more than $61 million to miss
the playoffs for the third consecutive season, was probably
thinking the same.
</P>
<P>
   After the Philadelphia Flyers wrapped up the best record in the
Eastern Conference with a 4-1 victory Sunday at the Garden, the
Rangers' 1999-2000 season mercifully ended.
</P>
<P>
   With their third consecutive loss, the Rangers closed out their
third consecutive losing season with an 0-8-1 record. The Rangers
finished 29-41-12-3 over all, their worst record in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   How complete was their collapse? The Rangers were 1-11-2 over
the final 14 games. They lost their final five home games and
finished 15-21-5 at the Garden, the third consecutive season they
have had a losing record at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the end of a nightmare, that's for sure,'' said John
Tortorella, the Rangers' interim coach. ``As far as the
organization is concerned, I guess the best thing to do now is
start looking ahead, because we're rock bottom right now. It can't
get any lower than this.''
</P>
<P>
   The players were scheduled to report to the team's training
facility in Rye, N.Y., Monday afternoon for season-ending
physicals. Each player will report to the Garden offices Tuesday or
Wednesday for individual meetings with the assistant general
manager, Don Maloney, and the Garden president, Dave Checketts.
</P>
<P>
   Then it is up to Checketts to pick a successor to Neil Smith,
the team president and general manager he fired on March 28 along
with Coach John Muckler.
</P>
<P>
   The new general manager's first duty will be to pick a coach.
Then, perhaps, the healing can truly begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is over,'' Tortorella said. ``And now we can start
fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   Only three holdovers remain from the Rangers team that won the
Stanley Cup in 1994: defenseman Brian Leetch, wing Adam Graves and
goaltender Mike Richter. The last three seasons have worn on all
three, and this season hurt the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we had higher expectations,'' Graves said. ``And when
you fall short of your expectations, it's not a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stanley Cup playoffs begin Wednesday, without the Rangers.
``It's supposed to be the best time of the year,'' said Leetch, who
has been the Rangers' captain the last three seasons. ``It feels
like it can't get any worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Leetch hinted that changes were needed in the dressing room.
``We certainly need a different approach from the way things are
right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers could use more production from players like Theo
Fleury, a 31-year-old right wing, who finished his worst season in
street clothes because of a sore right knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably shouldn't have played the last month,'' said
Fleury, who finished with 15 goals in 80 games, his fewest goals
since he scored 14 in 36 games as a rookie in 1988-89.
</P>
<P>
   Fleury, who signed a three-year, $21 million contract last
summer, repeated his desire to remain a Ranger. He has a no-trade
clause, and said Sunday that he would not waive it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Fleury has a way to go before he wins his way back into
the good graces of Rangers fans.
</P>
<P>
   That became clear when Fleury was booed during a postgame
fan-appreciation ceremony in which the players took the sweaters
off their backs and handed them to young fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``As players, we have to take responsibility for what happened
this season,'' Fleury said. ``But so many other things happened
here. It obviously could have been better. It should have been
better.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't. Hence the Garden boos.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans have actually been pretty good to us, considering the
way this season's gone,'' Leetch said.
</P>
<P>
   The fans saved their best for last, however. As the Rangers were
handing their sweaters to the children, a fan yelled out one last
zinger:
</P>
<P>
   ``Throw it back at them!''

GALINDO FEELS LIBERATED WITH HIS CANDOR ABOUT HIV ILLNESS

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ As usual, Rudy Galindo received a sustained
ovation Sunday as he performed to ``Send in the Clowns'' on the
Champions on Ice figure skating tour. He may be unrivaled as a show
skater _ who else could bring solemn grace to the use of a hula
hoop? _ and his elegant routine brought repeat applause and the
strobe-like flash of cameras.
</P>
<P>
   There is a special poignancy to this year's tour. Last week
Galindo announced in an interview with USA Today that he was
suffering from HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. The disease has
devastated the skating world in the last decade, most notably
taking the life of John Curry, the 1976 Olympic champion. Two of
Galindo's coaches have also died of AIDS, as has his brother,
George.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking publicly about his illness was in keeping with
Galindo's directness. He kept skating insistently in Olympic-style
competitions, despite feeling that he was discriminated against
because he was gay and Mexican-American. He won the 1996 national
championship with one of the most moving performances in the
history of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   He decided to speak about HIV because the truth has always been
liberating for him, especially in a sport where rumor and gossip
often take on the force of fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being openly gay, having the cards laid on the table, made
everything easier for me in skating and making my choices in
whatever road I took in life,'' Galindo said in an interview before
Sunday's performance. ``Now, being out with this, people don't have
that look in their eyes. No one is saying, `What do you really
have?' Now that it's out in the open, I'm relieved, relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   He gets frightened sometimes, he said, knowing what his brother
and his coaches endured, the wasting, the incontinence, the
suffering. But his doctor, the Reno-based infectious-disease
specialist, Steven Parker, has told him that HIV does not have to
be a death sentence anymore. And he has the example of Magic
Johnson, who remains vigorous 8 1/2 years after his public
diagnosis. He also his own story of skating perseverance to rely
on, winning the national title in San Jose, Calif., his hometown,
riding a bike to the training rink because he could not afford a
car.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I was scared, of course,'' the 30-year-old Galindo
said. ``My coaches died of it, my brother died of it. But they were
in a different era. The medication they're coming up with is great.
I'm learning more about it from my doctors and family. They're
saying you can live a healthy life if you just take care of
yourself and take your medicine. I haven't spoken to Magic, but
he's given me hope. He's still strong and healthy and I know I can
do it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   He is not certain how he contracted the illness, Galindo said,
although he has previously acknowledged a defiant period of
alcohol, drugs and reckless sex after the breakup with his former
pairs partner, Kristi Yamaguchi. Together, they won national pairs
championships in 1989 and 1990. As a singles skater, Yamaguchi went
on to win a gold medal the 1992 Winter Olympics while Galindo's
career faltered for a time into despondency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through my rebellious time after Kristi and I split
up,'' Galindo said. ``I made some bad mistakes. I'm only human.''
The need to practice safe sex was not something that was stressed
by his family or by skating officials when he was younger, he said.
Now, by speaking out, he said he hoped to encourage others that
safe sex is not an empty slogan and that those at risk should be
tested for HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I won the `96 nationals, being openly gay and
Mexican-American, I made a statement that you can do anything you
want, no matter who you are,'' Galindo said. ``Having this disease,
I'm telling people, `Just be careful. It can happen to anyone.' Any
way I can help makes me feel good and helps me with what I have.''
</P>
<P>
   He had begun to feel sick last January, as if his lungs were
``going to close up completely,'' Galindo said. Respiratory
problems are not uncommon for skaters, but this time he knew even
before the doctor told him that this was something worse than
asthma or bronchitis. He withdrew from the Goodwill Games in
mid-February and told his coach, Laura Galindo Black, who is also
his sister, ``This is getting worse.''
</P>
<P>
   He returned to Reno, where he was diagnosed with HIV on March 1.
Once assured that he could resume a normal life with medication, he
began to wonder about his career. Would he be able to skate again?
How would the other skaters react? The several days of tour
rehearsal last week were nerve-wracking, Galindo said. He felt as
if all eyes were on him, and when the tour opened last Thursday in
Baltimore, he could hear whispers in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he has received standing ovations in Washington,
D.C., and Boston. The other skaters have welcomed him. Tom Collins,
the tour's executive producer, gathered the troupe in Washington on
Friday and told Galindo, ``You have a lot of people who love you
and care for you on this tour.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The outpouring of support had to be extremely relieving,''
said Jerod Swallow, a five-time national ice-dancing champion with
his wife, Elizabeth Punsalan, who are close friends of Galindo's.
``People have not been ignorant, as we hoped they wouldn't be.
Figure skating has had its share of awareness and education on this
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Galindo has tried to leaven his illness with his familiar,
astringent humor. The other day, he asked Michael Collins, the
assistant tour manager, ``Can you fly in some white blood cells for
me?'' He awakens early each morning to take the first of five daily
pills, then goes back to sleep, trying to alleviate a slight sense
of dizziness _ ``like trying to skate on a sleeping pill'' _ caused
by the medication. His lungs feel clear and his stamina is
improving with each performance, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad a little bit, what I'm going through,'' Galindo said.
``There will be sad times. I can have those in my room. I just want
to be happy again. I think being on this tour is going to do it.
I'd rather do this than sit at home in Reno, waiting for the next
test or the next doctor's appointment. It's good to be on the road,
around friends. It's almost like a second family. I'm lucky to be
out there.''

KENTUCKIAN COULD BE HEADED HOME WITH DERBY FAVORITE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ It marvels Jenine Sahadi that she can remember
her first trip to the Kentucky Derby, especially considering her
surroundings that day in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my freshman year at University of Kentucky, and I was
in the infield,'' she said. ``I'll just leave it at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sahadi, 37, is headed back to the Derby, but this trip will be a
lot more tame. In terms of debauchery, Mardi Gras has nothing on
the infield when 50,000 people are packed into it at the Kentucky
Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Sahadi trains The Deputy, who is going to be one of the
favorites in Kentucky after he won the Santa Anita Derby on
Saturday. With Chris McCarron riding, The Deputy rallied despite a
wide trip and a slow pace to beat previously unbeaten War Chant.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Santa Anita Derby has produced the Kentucky Derby
winner each of the past three years, it has never been the winner
of the Santa Anita Derby. Silver Charm and Real Quiet finished
second at Santa Anita before winning in Kentucky, and Charismatic
was a very unimpressive fourth last year before the trip to
Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern might favor the more lightly raced War Chant, whom
jockey Jerry Bailey said was showing his inexperience because he
gawked at The Deputy instead of competing against him in the
stretch. And maybe Captain Steve or Anees shouldn't be thrown out
of consideration because they were trying to close on slow
fractions of 471/5 seconds through the opening half mile.
</P>
<P>
   Surfside set those fractions, but she still ``didn't offer much
resistance'' according to jockey Pat Day when War Chant and The
Deputy made their moves. D. Wayne Lukas trains Surfside and said
she likely will go back in with fillies in the Kentucky Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Irwin, who put together the ownership syndication that
imported The Deputy from Great Britain for $500,000, thinks he
won't be beaten by any of those horses in the Santa Anita field. He
worries more about Fusaichi Pegasus, who handed The Deputy his only
loss since coming to North America in the San Felipe Stakes on
March 19.
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus has his final Derby prep in the Wood Memorial
Stakes on Saturday in New York. He'll have to beat highly regarded
Gotham Stakes winner Red Bullet, and he'll have to handle his own
notorious nervous disposition once he gets in front of the crowd of
more than 130,000 people at the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think our horse will be bothered by that,'' Irwin
said. ``Unless Red Bullet or some other freaky horse shows up, I
think we're in a great spot.'' \Nsubheds:Lone Star news Bob Baffert
said he might ship Purely Cozzene to Lone Star for the $200,000 USA
Stakes that's part of Lone Star Million Day on May 29.
</P>
<P>
   Purely Cozzene was a front-running winner by 21/2 lengths in the
$75,000 La Puente Stakes at a mile on the Santa Anita turf course
April 2. Baffert trains the colt and said he'll likely run in the
Will Rogers Handicap at Hollywood Park on May 6 before coming to
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Cerin said he's unsure if he'll send Archer City Slew
for the $300,000 Lone Star Derby on April 22. But he confirmed that
he's shipping the Frank Stronach-owned Luftikus, second to General
Challenge in the $500,000 Strub Stakes on Feb. 5, for the $300,000
Texas Mile. The Mile field is likely to include 1999 Met Mile
winner Sir Bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to give \RArcher City Slew\S a little time to
regroup before I decide if I'm going to send him to Lone Star,''
Cerin said after the colt ran seventh in the Turfway Park Spiral
Stakes in his previous start. ``We're obviously off the Derby
trail. So I want to find a race I think he can win.''
</P>
<P>
   David Flores is scheduled to ride Luftikus.

ISSUES ASIDE, WARRICK MIGHT BE CATCH OF THE DRAFT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Peter Warrick's past might scare away some
teams. Others might pass on him because of his 40-yard dash time.
</P>
<P>
   But, on film, there is nothing to fear in Warrick but fear
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick caught 132 passes for 2,166 yards and 19 touchdowns the
past two seasons at Florida State. He arguably was the best player
in college football in 1999, and he might be the best player
available in the NFL draft Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But Warrick might not be the first, the second or the third
player selected. Whether it's his shopping scandal, his
unimpressive time in the 40-yard dash or the emergence of Penn
State defenders Courtney Brown and LaVar Arrington, Warrick's stock
has fallen.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're up, people are with you,'' Warrick said. ``But
when you're down, you have a lot of people that go against you. You
can't please everybody. The only person you can try to please is
God. Everything happens for a reason.''
</P>
<P>
   In September, Warrick and a teammate bought $412.38 worth of
clothing for $21.40. Florida State suspended Warrick for two games
after his misdemeanor guilty plea.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a mistake,'' said Bruce Coslet, whose Cincinnati
Bengals own the fourth choice. ``Ask him if he'd do it again. Well,
how do you learn? You learn from your mistakes. They've got to grow
up. I think he'll be fine. Believe me, I don't think he's any kind
of problem like that.''
</P>

US AUDIT: BIG DIG IS `BANKRUPT' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal highway investigators have concluded that
the Big Dig project should be viewed as ``bankrupt,'' and that
Governor Paul Cellucci should move rapidly to oust managers who
misled government oversight authorities about the operation's
overruns, according to a source familiar with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The development indicates that the Big Dig chief, James J.
Kerasiotes, and his top aides could be in imminent danger of losing
their jobs. Cellucci and the Massachusetts congressional delegation
are expected to be briefed on the findings on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Just as US Transportation Secretary Rodney E. Slater quickly
transferred his regional Big Dig watchdog, Peter Markle, last
month, after Kerasiotes startled federal officials by reporting a
$1.4 billion cost overrun, Cellucci will be urged to act quickly to
shake up the state management team, the source said of the findings
by the 14-member federal task force.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations from the group's audit are included in a
draft report that was delivered to Slater's staff. Slater, who is
expected to study the report before making a final decision, wields
heavy influence over the state, since the federal government is
picking up more than 70 percent of the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Slater now faces the dual pressures of convincing powerful
watchdogs in Congress that he will be tough enough on Big Dig
officials and of not throwing the project into calamity by calling
for action that could halt its federal funding.
</P>
<P>
   Branding the Big Dig ``bankrupt,'' though it is backed by state,
federal and Massachusetts Port Authority funds, would send a
warning about the gravity of the state financing crisis that has
been triggered by the overrun.
</P>
<P>
   It could also raise concerns on Wall Street if Cellucci pursues
his plan to borrow $1 billion to help cover the overrun. The
Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether the
state, in bond offerings last year, provided inaccurate financial
information.
</P>
<P>
   The draft report also recommends accepting Cellucci's new state
oversight plan for the Big Dig, although the review team has called
for rejecting the governor's financial proposal for completing the
project.
</P>
<P>
   The state has hired the accounting firm Deloitte &AMP; Touche to
serve as an independent auditor of the Big Dig, monitoring the
project's daily operations and its myriad contracts with private
companies. The state auditor's office has also conducted numerous
inquiries into the project.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the draft report calls for an investigation into
whether state officials who may have mishandled the project should
be barred from participating in any future federally funded
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Herald reported Saturday that Kerasiotes has asked
federal officials not to consider the possibility of prohibiting
him from taking part in federally subsidized projects in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   The source in Washington said the task-force report contains 25
to 30 recommendations, a number of which have been reported by the
Globe.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the Big Dig, originally projected in 1985 as $2.5
billion, has ballooned to at least $12.2 billion and could increase
to more than $13.1 billion, officials have said. Since Governor
William F. Weld took office in 1991 with Cellucci as his lieutenant
governor, the projected cost has increased from $5.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Highway Administration, which is under Slater's
jurisdiction, is charged with monitoring the federal government's
multibillion-dollar investment in the Big Dig, the nation's largest
public works project.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Central Artery/Tunnel project, as the Big Dig is
formally known, the Ted Williams Tunnel was built under Boston
Harbor, and most of the Central Artery is being moved underground.
</P>
<P>
   Although the project has long been the subject of controversy in
Washington because of the cost to taxpayers, a firestorm has raged
since early February, when Kerasiotes announced that the Big Dig's
cost had risen from $10.8 billion to $12.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Kerasiotes, who manages the Big Dig as chairman of the
Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, had long assured federal
officials that the cost would not exceed $10.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Kerasiotes announced the $1.4 billion overrun the
day after Slater received the state's annual financial plan for the
Big Dig, which continued to put the cost at $10.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Big Dig officials defended the $10.8 billion figure
in the financial plan, saying the document predated a comprehensive
review that led to the $12.2 billion projection.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Massachusetts House approved a plan to pay for
the Big Dig overrun with $400 million in cash and $1.3 billion in
car registration and driver's license fees that had been scheduled
to be phased out.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci, describing his $1 billion borrowing plan as more
fiscally sound, called the House action ``lunacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, pressure is expected to grow on Cellucci to take
action against Kerasiotes and others in state government who were
responsible for the Big Dig's finances.
</P>
<P>
   The draft report cites Slater's precedent in transferring
Markle, the federal regional highway administrator, out of his
Cambridge office after Kerasiotes's disclosure of the $1.4 billion
overrun took transportation officials in Washington by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said last week that he would not decide Kerasiotes's
fate until he had been briefed by Slater.

CUBAN A MAVERICK IN THE MAKING AS OWNER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ He burst onto the NBA scene in January, a
self-professed geek from the rapidly moving Internet world. He also
had a lot of big _ if not borderline quirky _ ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Cuban, a risk-taker at heart, wanted to solve all of the
Mavericks' problems immediately. He signed the most eccentric
player (Dennis Rodman) maybe ever to play in the NBA in the hopes
of unraveling the mystery of why this franchise has been a playoff
bystander for 10 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But even Rodman turned on the optimistic Cuban, saying: ``I
think that his position and his job is not to sit there and hang on
the players like a coach. That's something like Jerry Jones. That's
kind of dumb.''
</P>
<P>
   At it turns out, Cuban, 41, is no dummy. He made $1.5 billion
last summer selling his Internet company, Broadcast.com, to Yahoo.
Cuban then parlayed that fortune into his lifelong dream _ the
purchase of a professional sports franchise.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 3, Cuban signed a letter of intent to purchase
controlling interest of the Mavericks from Ross Perot Jr. for an
NBA-record $280 million. The final approval of Cuban's bid is
expected tomorrow in New York, where the NBA Board of Governors are
scheduled to meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just excited to get it over with,'' Cuban said. ``It's
been a long time. It seems like forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect any problems. I'm sure if there were any
issues, they'd tell me not to come.''
</P>
<P>
   NBA commissioner David Stern says the 28 owners support Cuban,
that tomorrow's scheduled vote is but a technicality. They are
counting on Cuban's gusto invigorating a dormant franchise in a
league seemingly stagnant since Michael Jordan retired.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban agitated some of the more conservative owners when he
signed Rodman then put him up in his Preston Hollow guest home, and
rented one of his luxury cars to guard Greg Buckner. Many owners
also despise the way Cuban caters to players, while the players
revere Cuban's generosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited he's in the league,'' said Philadelphia 76ers
owner Pat Croce, who became team president in March 1996. ``I love
a guy who's got enthusiasm and excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know some of the things in regards to the limos may walk the
fine line of the collective-bargaining agreement law. But he's
learning what that fine line is.''
</P>
<P>
   From limo rides, food in both locker rooms, Super Bowl parties
and a 10-man coaching staff to expensive luggage, towels and
bathrobes, Cuban has spared no expense to provide his players the
best of everything. He has even discussed installing entertainment
centers in each of the Mavericks' lockers in the new arena.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban's ownership style contrasts Perot's. The Mavericks' second
majority owner let coach/general manager Don Nelson run the
basketball portion of the franchise and chief executive
officer/president Terdema Ussery run the business side. Cuban is a
hands-on guy who plans to oversee both the basketball and business
operations of the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's nice now to have a full-time owner who's as
creative as Mark is and has his energy and his passion for the
game, and I think he adds a lot,'' Perot said. ``My ownership style
helped take us through this transition, helped rebuild the team and
put a good foundation underneath the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, Mark's a good owner to take this team into truly the
upper levels of basketball. Mark's going to be a great owner.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks never made the playoffs in Perot's tenure, but
Perot succeeded in getting a new arena. The American Airlines
Center is scheduled to open for the 2001-02 season, and Cuban is
determined that it will house a winner.
</P>
<P>
   His passion borders on obsession, and the team's long-suffering
fans appreciate his zest. Cuban has hired a new public-address
announcer, added three assistants to the coaching ranks and hired
former player Derek Harper as a team vice president. Cuban said he
wants to sign an impact free agent this summer, though the team is
already over next season's projected salary cap, and redesign the
team's logo and uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``The energy has been fantastic,'' guard Steve Nash said.
``There's been a lot of negative energy surrounding the Mavericks
for quite a while, and for him to come in and alleviate some of
that has been fantastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just given us a shot of energy. ... I think it definitely
hasn't gone unnoticed with the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks were 9-21 before Cuban signed that letter of
intent with Perot. Since, the Mavericks are 24-20 with two
victories over the defending NBA champion San Antonio Spurs, and
are on the verge of finishing with the franchise's best record
since 1989-90. That was also the last time the Mavericks had their
playoff papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a businessman, and he wants to win,'' center Sean Rooks
said. ``At the same token, he's down to Earth, and he gets along
with the guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's only a big upside for Mark and for the Dallas
Mavericks.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern said during All-Star Weekend that he likes what Cuban
offers as an owner. With his background, Cuban will be expected to
help the NBA develop revenue sources online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark's going to be a very good focused and innovative owner,''
said Perot, who will become a minority owner. ``That's why I'm
excited and why I'll continue to be a partner with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The owners are excited to have Mark in. They like his energy,
they like his spirit, and it's good to have owners that are there
full time taking care of these teams. And it's going to be exciting
to watch Mark.''

MUGABE'S POPULARITY WANES AS THE ECONOMY WITHERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   RIMUKA, Zimbabwe _ At 2:50 p.m., 10 minutes before the rally was
supposed to start, a long flat-bed truck rounded the corner and
raced down the far edge of the soccer field carrying a large mob of
angry men. They were expected.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in 20 years, Zimbabwe is heading into an
election that offers the people a real choice. The stakes are high,
the country is tense, and political violence unfolds almost daily
as if by script. The men in the truck Sunday porters of the ruling
party and President Robert Mugabe. They came with axes, clubs, and
broken bricks to prevent their opponents from meeting.
</P>
<P>
   After a tense standoff, the rally went ahead as planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to spread fear so that nobody will vote against
them,'' said Brighton Chingaranda, a member of the Movement for
Democratic Change, a grass-roots opposition group hoping to topple
Mugabe in parliamentary elections next month. ``But the fear has
been completely broken. The people are confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Tapping into deep frustration over economic decay and government
corruption, the Movement has joined trade unionists, human-rights
groups, and ordinary people in a mass call for change. The ruling
class, virtually unchallenged for two decades, is rattled. Mugabe
has resorted to violence, sending veterans of the war for
independence to invade white-owned farms and trucking in toughs to
scare people away from the opposition. More than 800 farms have
been attacked in recent weeks, including several this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis is unprecedented for Zimbabwe. The country faces
crippling shortages of foreign currency. Drivers wait in long lines
for gas and diesel and are often turned away empty. Prices of bread
and cornmeal break meager monthly salaries.
</P>
<P>
   To many Zimbabwe voters, Mugabe seems aloof. While waging a war
in the Democratic Republic of Congo, backing Congolese President
Laurent Kabila at an estimated cost of $3 million a month, he sows
racism and instability to retain his power, his critics contend.
His actions are often considered lawless. Ignoring a high court
ruling, Mugabe has encouraged war veterans to seize and resettle
white-owned farms. As a result, Western governments and lending
institutions last week froze more than $200 million in desperately
needed aid.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Mugabe has used intimidation to keep the public
down, political scientists here said. His military massacred his
ethnic rivals during the mid-1980s. Violence routinely preceded
elections. Critical newspaper reporters and editors have been
detained and beaten.
</P>
<P>
   But the current economic crisis has taken Zimbabweans to a
breaking point, people say, and the fear of challenging Mugabe is
ebbing. What changed?
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone stood up and had the guts to say enough is enough,''
said Burt Pyman, a farm foreman.
</P>
<P>
   That person is Morgan Tsvangirai, a former labor chief and
founding member of the Movement for Democratic Change. Forged by
shop-floor politics and driven by a sense of service, Tsvangirai
comes from a new generation of African leaders who are slowing
replacing their autocratic elders. Understated and determined, he
is nonetheless a reluctant vessel for the people's hopes, accepting
the role he has been given without ever really seeking it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a heavy responsibility,'' he said, ``but sometimes you
get humbled by it. This country has the potential, but it also has
the potential to slide into chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   Tsvangirai is undeterred by Mugabe's threats. He has been
beaten, arrested, and jailed. His house has been attacked. But he
walks around Harare, the capital, unprotected, and jumps in cars
unaccompanied to talk at length with journalists. When he arrives
at rallies, women dance and sing, ``I love Tsvangirai so much I
could strap him on my back,'' as they do their infants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mugabe has moved from hero to villian,'' Tsvangirai said.
``You could not ask for a better opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   Tsvangirai is counting on a generational change to topple
Mugabe. While the president courts the older generation that fought
for liberation, Tsvangirai appeals to a younger audience. And he
vows to make many changes. He'd withdraw from Congo, set up a
commission to arrest and try those in government who are suspected
of having stolen large amounts of public money _ including Mugabe,
he quickly points out _ and impose painful economic measures to
shore up the country's international credit ratings.
</P>
<P>
   On land rights, Zimbabwe's most volatile issue, Tsvangirai said
there is no need to confiscate white-owned farms. Plenty of land
lies fallow, he said. What is needed is a plan for development, he
said, adding that would also scrap the communal land structure,
which has denied peasants the right to own the small plots they
live on.
</P>
<P>
   The critical question is what it will take for Tsvangirai to win
and whether Mugabe would accept defeat. The elections are
parliamentary, and Mugabe still has two years left in his term. But
Tsvangirai believes he can win 65 percent of the seats _ an
ambitious figure, since Mugabe's ruling Zimbabwe African National
Union-Patriotic Front holds 147 of 150 seats now. If Mugabe's foes
control the legislature, Tsvangirai said, Mugabe would be forced to
resign.
</P>
<P>
   Many fear, however, that Mugabe is looking for an excuse to
impose emergency rule, whether by provoking conflict between war
veterans and white farmers or through other political violence.
Would he accept being rejected by the voters? The question does
worry Tsvangirai.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do we encourage Mugabe to have an honorable exit?'' he
said. ``You see, that is the biggest challenge.''

MEL STOTTLEMYRE SAYS HE WILL BEGIN CANCER TREATMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Mel Stottlemyre, the Yankees' pitching coach and a
three-time 20-game winner for the team in the 1960s, revealed
Sunday that he has cancer of the bone marrow, or multiple myeloma.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre, 58, will begin chemotherapy treatments this week.
``I feel fine,'' he said. ``Now it's time for me to go in and
tackle this.''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre will not be at Yankee Stadium on Tuesday, when the
team plays its home opener against the Texas Rangers, but otherwise
he expects to continue his work. ``My doctors have assured me I'm
going to be able to carry on my normal duties, and I'm going to try
to,'' he said. ``There may be some point later in the season where
I may miss some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Multiple myeloma is a type of cancer formed by malignant plasma
cells. Plasma cells are crucial to the immune system, and when
produced at an abnormal rate, they can cause tumors, particularly
in the bone marrow, and cause anemia, fatigue and increased
susceptibility to infection.
</P>
<P>
   After Stottlemyre completes a four-month series of chemotherapy
_ four days of chemotherapy every four weeks _ he will undergo a
stem cell transplant, in which cells taken from him will be
cleansed and reintroduced into his system. Stottlemyre, who will
receive his treatment at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in
Manhattan, said he is ``borderline anemic'' but has felt no
fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Neilson, the coach of hockey's Philadelphia Flyers, also
has multiple myeloma, and he underwent a stem cell transplant last
month, and he left the team to have the treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre said: ``They have used the word `cure,' which I'm
very thankful for. The results from this treatment have been pretty
positive. I'm healthy in other standards, so everything is in my
favor.''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre said he first learned he might develop the illness
after a blood test taken during a routine physical examination in
spring training of 1999. Yankees Manager Joe Torre underwent
surgery for prostate cancer in March 1999, and afterward
Stottlemyre told Torre of his own ominous test results.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre's blood was tested monthly thereafter. On March 17
this year, he flew to New York for a test while the Yankees were
playing an exhibition game in Orlando, Fla. In the days that
followed, he was told he has the disease. Stottlemyre owns a home
in the Seattle area and in recent days received a second opinion
that supported the initial diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   As Stottlemyre spoke with reporters Sunday, Torre informed the
players in a team meeting, carefully reading from notes. The
players were stunned. He then asked for questions, and they
responded with silence. Stottlemyre went about his work, same as
always, pausing to speak about his prognosis with pitchers Andy
Pettitte and Mike Stanton. David Cone, who flew to New York Sunday
morning to prepare for his start Tuesday, was reached by phone,
with Torre and then Stottlemyre speaking to him in the first
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mel's a real positive man,'' Pettitte said afterward, staring
straight ahead as he dressed. ``He's a tough man.''
</P>
<P>
   Mel Stottlemyre and his wife, Jean, are the parents of three
sons. Jason, the youngest, died of leukemia in 1981. Stottlemyre
and members of his family have done extensive charity work for The
Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. Todd Stottlemyre, the second oldest,
is a pitcher with the Arizona Diamondbacks. After his father
received the diagnosis last month, Todd offered to fly to Florida
to be with him, but Mel encouraged him to remain in Arizona and
prepare for the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, here he had a son go through a similar deal where
leukemia had taken his life, and now to have to battle it in his
adult life,'' Todd Stottlemyre said in a news conference in
Phoenix. ``Yet to do it, as courageous as he is and with the
attitude he is, to me gives him a fighting chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Mel Stottlemyre first pitched for the Yankees in 1964 and
compiled a record of 164-139 during an 11-year career. After
several years out of baseball, Stottlemyre went into coaching,
first as a roving instructor with the Seattle Mariners. He became
the pitching coach of the Mets in 1984, and he worked with Dwight
Gooden, Ron Darling and Cone. The Mets won the World Series in
1986.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre joined the Houston Astros for two seasons before
being hired by the Yankees before the 1996 season. The Yankees have
won three championships in the last four seasons, pitching always
the foundation of their success.
</P>
<P>
   Uniformly optimistic and gregarious, Stottlemyre is respected by
the pitchers because he effectively relates to them. Cone said last
year that Stottlemyre anticipates how pitchers prefer to be treated
and coached, during and between games. Stottlemyre said he had
learned a lot from talking with his two oldest sons, both of whom
have played in the majors. ``It's like he never got older,'' Cone
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees players have said, only half-joking, that
Stottlemyre could still pitch in the majors. A sinkerball pitcher
when he played, Stottlemyre throws batting practice and has been
considered by the players as the most difficult coach to hit
against because his pitches sink and dart and move all over the
place. He has always been in excellent condition, not appearing
much different now than in his playing days.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I sit here now, I feel the same as I have for the last five
years,'' Stottlemyre said. ``I've had no hints, no signs of any
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty important for me to continue to work, something
that I enjoy doing, something I enjoy being around, for my state of
mind. It's real important. Obviously, if it comes to a point where
it's going to interfere with my work, my health is first, and if it
creates a problem for my family, it will change. Right now, I do
really feel I need to stay a part of the ball club.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Cloninger, the Yankees' bullpen coach, will serve as the
pitching coach Tuesday, working alongside Torre in the dugout, and
if there are days during the season when Stottlemyre's treatments
cause him to miss work, Cloninger most likely would step in.
</P>
<P>
   Mel and Todd Stottlemyre spoke Sunday morning, before Mel made
his illness public. ``What he said to me this morning was, `Win one
for me tomorrow,''' Todd Stottlemyre said, choking back tears.
``I'd love to get out of here now, but at the same time I know he
wants me to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre said: ``When I was diagnosed last year, I had to leave. I
was just scared to death. Mel's a strong guy, and I think I can
understand why he wants to keep working. That's better than sitting
around and thinking about it and worrying about it. There's nothing
more than hurt. It makes the nights very long.'' &QL;

MEMORIES OF MILITARY CHOW NEVER GROW COLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As you may have heard or read, some of the brightest minds on
Madison Avenue have been recruited to help generate more recruits
for the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines.
</P>
<P>
   So far their efforts have achieved minimal results. That's
because the government obviously didn't recruit any ``old
soldiers'' to write the advertising copy.
</P>
<P>
   First you have to define the problem. And as any veteran can
attest, the pay is bad, the hours are lousy, the clothes don't fit
and the food is inedible. Oh, yeah, and on occasion complete
strangers shoot at you.
</P>
<P>
   To be successful, a media recruiting campaign must attack these
problems one by one. I'm not sure our generals and admirals are
ready to eliminate bullets and baggy fatigues. But I suspect they
may be nearing a breakthrough on food poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   At the intelligence level, the age-old problem has been
code-named SOS.
</P>
<P>
   That does not stand for, ``save our stomachs,'' but that comes
pretty close. SOS is the chow-line equivalent of ``friendly fire.''
It is poison we inflict upon our own troops, usually at dawn when
defenses are down.
</P>
<P>
   For the uninformed (and ununiformed), SOS stands for Saute on a
Shingle, a staple of service cookery. I will repeat the recipe,
which I first encountered a few decades ago at Fort Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Select three medium-size basic trainees. Remove from their bunks
at 3:30 a.m. and lead them from the barracks to the mess hall, at
the point of an automatic rifle. Assign one to help a cook burn 100
pounds of hamburger, the second to help prepare 30 gallons of
library paste, and the third to char the edges of 1,000 pieces of
bread.
</P>
<P>
   Combine all three ingredients and serve, on cold metal trays, to
500 grumbling, shuffling gourmets who will mutter, in unison,
``Don't tell me they expect us to eat this saute ...'' Or something
like that.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe they don't have to eat it anymore. A recent news
report described experiments now under way to provide quick energy
to troops in emergency situations with a sort of nutritional
Band-Aid affixed to the arm. It supposedly will give the GIs an
energy boost, like they might otherwise get from a candy bar or a
cold beer.
</P>
<P>
   Why haven't the advertising copywriters seized upon this? The
hours will still be lousy, the pants will still be baggy, you'll
never get rich by digging a ditch. But a Band-Aid solution to Saute
on a Shingle could prompt a whole lot of old veterans to re-enlist.
</P>
<P>
   On second thought, naaaaah.
</P>
<P>
   And it's doubtful if they will all adopt the Band-Aid diet in
their civilian lives. Not when there are alternatives like these:
</P>
<P>
   Old Sergeant's Stew
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup canola or olive oil
</P>
<P>
   4 pounds lean beef chunks
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup flour
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds large onions, thickly sliced
</P>
<P>
   6 cloves garlic, put through a press
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup red wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons thyme leaves
</P>
<P>
   2 to 3 teaspoons salt, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   Lots of freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 and one-half cups beef broth or bouillon
</P>
<P>
   2 12-ounce cans or bottles of beer
</P>
<P>
   4 large carrots, in one-inch chunks
</P>
<P>
   Cut the beef into three-quarter-inch chunks.
</P>
<P>
   OK, heat the oil in a large skillet. Coat the beef with flour,
then brown in small batches. When each batch is done, transfer with
a slotted spoon to an oven casserole.
</P>
<P>
   When all the meat is done, toss the onions into the skillet and
let 'em sizzle for about two minutes. Add the garlic and cook
another minute, then add this mess to the casserole, along with the
sugar, vinegar, thyme, salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the beef broth into the empty skillet. Stir with a wooden
spoon to incorporate any brown bits in the pan, then pour this
sludge into the casserole. Add the beer, and I prefer a dark brew.
</P>
<P>
   Cover the casserole and shove into a 325-degree oven for two
hours. After the first hour, stir in the carrots then return to the
oven.
</P>
<P>
   When done, move the casserole to the burner on your range. Stir
in three tablespoons of Wondra flour that have been mixed with a
third of a cup of water. Keep stirring and when the sauce has
thickened, serve the stew with:
</P>
<P>
   Civilian Cornbread
</P>
<P>
   1 and one-half cups flour
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 and one-half cups yellow cornmeal
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup grated Romano cheese
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup chopped green pepper
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup sliced green onions
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons melted butter or canola oil
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoons chili powder
</P>
<P>
   1 and one-third cups milk
</P>
<P>
   2 slightly beaten eggs
</P>
<P>
   Sift together flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Stir in
cornmeal, cheese, green pepper and onion.
</P>
<P>
   Plunk the butter or oil in small bowl and stir in the chili
powder, milk and eggs. Mix, then plop this mess into the dry
ingredients and stir just until all the flour is moistened.
</P>
<P>
   Pour batter into a greased, 9-inch-square cake pan. Bake in a
400-degree oven for about 35 minutes, or until a toothpick comes
out clean after you poke the bread in the middle. We are assuming
that the toothpick was clean when you stuck it in. Cut in squares
and serve warm.

JONBENET'S MOTHER WAS KILLER, DETECTIVE SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A former Boulder police detective who spent almost two years
investigating the murder of JonBenet Ramsey says in a new book that
he and other investigators concluded that the 6-year-old girl was
killed by her mother, Patsy Ramsey.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Thomas, who resigned from the police department in
mid-1998, writes that he concluded that Patsy Ramsey strangled her
daughter in a panic on Christmas night 1996 after accidentally
causing a serious wound to the little girl's head. He also contends
that the girl's father, John Ramsey, after realizing what had
happened, ``chose to protect his wife'' rather than help the
authorities determine what happened.
</P>
<P>
   By outlining his theory in ``JonBenet: Inside the Ramsey Murder
Investigation'' (St. Martin's Press), which is scheduled to be
released to the public on Tuesday, Thomas has become the first
person with direct knowledge of the investigation to publicly
accuse Patsy Ramsey of killing her daughter. He also says he
concluded that John Ramsey played no role in the girl's death.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations against Patsy Ramsey were disputed by her
lawyer, L. Lin Wood, who called them ``fiction and utter
nonsense,'' and other Boulder officials are believed to have views
that differ from Thomas'.
</P>
<P>
   Wood said in an interview that Thomas' theory ``is refuted in
its entirety by medical evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys deny that they were involved in the killing. In
their own book, ``Death of Innocence'' (Thomas Nelson), which was
released last month, they argue that JonBenet was killed by an
intruder, a theory that some detectives favor.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas concedes in his book that one veteran homicide detective
who worked on the case, Lou Smit, believes that the evidence
suggests someone broke into the Ramseys' home in Boulder, Colo.,
strangled JonBenet ``in some sort of autoerotic fantasy'' and hid
her body in the basement where John Ramsey discovered it the next
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Guided by a police axiom that ``murders are usually what they
seem,'' Thomas counters, ``the simplest explanation for ... one of
the most perplexing and notorious murders of the decade is also the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' book is unlikely to spur any new police action. His
theory of the crime, as well as Smit's, has been vetted by
investigators and Alex Hunter, the Boulder district attorney. The
conflicting views, which mirror conflicting evidence, were largely
the reason that Hunter dismissed a grand jury last October that
heard evidence in the case for 13 months without indicting anyone.
</P>
<P>
   As Thomas admits in his book, Hunter and others did not feel
confident that all the evidence pointed in one direction.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter declined to discuss any specific points raised by Thomas,
but said in an interview, ``It is improper in my judgment for a cop
to be talking about confidential information in an ongoing case.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lack of indictments, the authorities in Boulder said
they were keeping the Ramseys ``under the umbrella of suspicion,''
as Mark Beckner, Boulder police chief, told reporters after the
grand jury was dismissed. But nobody in the case before Thomas had
revealed how detectives believed one scenario might point to Patsy
Ramsey as the killer.
</P>
<P>
   By Thomas' analysis, Patsy Ramsey had grown frazzled by
Christmas night 1996 because of ``an approaching fortieth birthday,
the busy holiday season, an exhausting Christmas Day and an
argument with JonBenet'' over a bed-wetting incident that led to
``some sort of explosive encounter in the child's bathroom,'' which
resulted in a mortal head wound.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas says he concluded that while JonBenet's head was probably
injured by accident, Patsy Ramsey, rather than summon help,
panicked after her daughter fell unconscious. That, he says, led
her to write a note suggesting that JonBenet had been kidnapped,
after which she ``faced the major problem of what to do with the
body.''
</P>
<P>
   It was at that point, Thomas concludes, that the accident turned
to murder. He says that on the way to placing her in a remote room
of the basement, Patsy Ramsey realized JonBenet was still alive.
``Only feet away was her paint tote,'' he writes. ``She grabbed a
paintbrush and broke it to fashion the garrote with some cord. Then
she looped the cord around the girl's neck.''
</P>
<P>
   To make it look like a kidnapping, he says, Patsy Ramsey tied
the girl's wrists and taped her mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Smit, a former Colorado Springs detective who worked on hundreds
of homicide cases before joining the Ramsey case at Hunter's
invitation in 1997, has often said that he believes the parents are
innocent. He contends that JonBenet was a victim of a pedophile who
molested her, used a stun gun to disable her and, after JonBenet
began screaming, killed her with a blow to the head, possibly with
a flashlight.
</P>
<P>
   Smit, who resigned from the case after a year, has also said
that medical evidence supports his theory more than Thomas'.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Thomas, certain of his interpretation of the evidence, still
regards Smit as a friend but ultimately dismisses him in the book
``as a major problem'' whose views went a long way toward what the
author feels was deferential treatment of the Ramseys by
prosecutors in the district attorney's office. That stance, more
than anything, Thomas writes, led to his resignation from the
police force.
</P>
<P>
   Wood said that Thomas' accusations could expose him to a
lawsuit, a view echoed by Hal Haddon, a lawyer who represents John
Ramsey. Wood also said it was inconceivable that either of the
Ramseys could have killed their daughter, or that if one had, the
other could cover it up.

SPORTS COLUMN: `THE ONLY POOR SHOT I HIT ALL WEEKEND' 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ For decades, the storyline at the Masters always
was that the golf tournament didn't really start until the back
nine on Sunday, but Augusta National's back nine seems to have lost
its sense of theater, especially on the 13th and 15th holes where
eagles used to fly.
</P>
<P>
   As Vijay Singh won Sunday, there was only one eagle 3 at the
485-yard 13th hole, by Colin Montgomerie, and none on the 500-yard
15th hole.
</P>
<P>
   The only theater occurred when David Duval, only one stroke
behind Singh at the time, splashed a 5-iron from 196 yards into the
narrow grassy creek in front of the 13th green.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to hit it in the same area that Vijay hit it,
kind of up the left center of the green,'' Duval would explain
later. ``I got over the ball, the wind picked up, then it would
die, and the same thing would keep happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just decided on the right line and the right club and hit a
poor golf shot. It was the wrong time to do that and I feel like
that was probably the only poor shot I hit this weekend. I really
don't know what else to say about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of possibly putting for an eagle, Duval wound up with a
bogie 6 as Singh birdied _ a sudden two-shot swing that created a
three-shot lead. Duval, with a 70, tied for third with Loren
Roberts, four shots back.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the bogie at the 13th, in other years Duval would have
had more of a chance to eagle the 15th, but before last year's
Masters, the green jackets planted a few pine trees to the right of
the fairway there to dissuade the golfers from just blasting away
on their tee shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's virtually impossible to get much closer on your second
shot than Vijay did,'' Duval said, referring to Singh's two-putt
birdie there. ``So that means you're going to have to hole out for
an eagle.''
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Els, the South African who finished second, three shots
back, had never played really well at the Masters before. His best
finish had been a tie for eighth in his first appearance, in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew from watching this tournament through the years that
everything happens on the back nine, and I had my chances,'' said
Els, whose 68 was the best score in the final round. ``I had an
eagle putt on 13 and I made birdie putts on 11 and 15.''
</P>
<P>
   But not much happened on the back nine Sunday and Els' three
birdies weren't nearly enough as Singh closed with a solid
three-under-par 69 after 72-67-70.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known Vijay a very long time,'' Els said. ``He's been my
practice-round partner for quite a few years. He showed his mettle
Sunday. He's done it before, winning the PGA, and now he's done it
again. This golf course is suited to his game. He's never really
putted here, but he really did the job today.''
</P>
<P>
   After Tiger Woods' 12-stroke victory that was a record 18 under
par in 1997, the Masters green jackets apparently did not want
Woods or anybody else tearing up their pea patch like that again.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt about it, this course is more difficult to play now
that it was in 1997,'' Woods said after a 69 that left him in fifth
place, six shots back. ``They've lengthened No. 2 about 40 or 50
yards. They've changed some of the greens. We had a new pin on No.
10 today. Traditionally, it was back left. Now it's front right.
Anything short is going down to the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough test now. I'm not saying it wasn't tough back
then, but it's tougher now because obviously you've got to drive
the ball better and you've still got to be good with the irons, but
now you've got to play out of the rough and you catch fliers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept the scores down, that's for sure,'' Woods continued.
``But the harder they make it for everybody, the better it plays
into the longer hitters. Look at the leaderboard. Vijay, Duval,
Els, myself, Davis Love, Lehman, Mickelson, all of us are long-ball
hitters. It makes it easier for us to play and more challenging for
people who can't hit the ball as far.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods thought that three missed putts prevented him from
exerting any pressure on the leaders on the back nine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If those putts go in at 10 and 11,'' he said with a shrug. ``I
hit beautiful putts there that just grazed the edge, then I misread
the putt on 13. If I make birdies there, I'd have been right in the
ball game.''
</P>
<P>
   But those putts didn't go in and Singh won in a Masters that was
more methodical than melodramatic.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago Duval thought he might win or at least be in a
sudden-death playoff until Mark O'Meara birdied three of the last
four holes. And yesterday he thought he might win until that 5-iron
splashed into the grassy creek in front of the 13th green. In his
disappointment, he was asked what he'll take away from what
happened?
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'll try again next year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the world's No. 2 ranked golfer was reminded that he
would take away about $266,800 in prize money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great,'' he said, sarcastically.
</P>
<P>
   David Duval already has $266,800, but he doesn't have a green
jacket. &QL;

FOES IN CONGO APPEAL FOR U.N. PEACEKEEPERS
</HEADLINE>
  By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KAMPALA, Uganda _ All sides in the slow-burning war in Congo
appealed Sunday for the United Nations to deploy peacekeepers
swiftly in the vast Central African country after another
cease-fire in the 18-month-old conflict was signed in the Ugandan
capital over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting Sunday with President Laurent Kabila in Kinshasa,
Congo's capital, his allies in the war _ the presidents of Angola,
Namibia and Zimbabwe _ urged the deployment of a planned 5,500
peacekeepers ``as rapidly as possible,'' state radio in Congo
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Congolese rebels backed by Rwanda and Uganda, all of whom have
been fighting Kabila, also said they supported swift deployment.
</P>
<P>
   The elements of the arrangement signed on Saturday in Kampala
were that all combatants would stop fighting by Friday, then hold
their positions for three months while the U.N. peacekeepers were
deployed in a buffer zone between the warring parties.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well, the warring countries can begin to withdraw
after three months.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press, reporting from Kigali, the Rwandan
capital, quoted a spokesman for the Congolese rebels, Kin-Kiey
Mulumba, as saying that his forces would respect the latest
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``By April 14, I think we'll do everything possible to be ready
to pull back,'' Mulumba was quoted as saying. ``But we don't know
what Kabila will do. So we would like to have the United Nations
deploy as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Moise Nyarugabo, a leader of the Rally for Congolese Democracy,
one of the rebel factions opposing Kabila, said no fighting was
taking place in sectors his men controlled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never opposed a cease-fire,'' he said in a radio
interview from Goma in eastern Congo. ``But when you're attacked,
you have to defend yourselves.'' The first cease-fire was signed
last summer in Lusaka. None of the provisions of that cease-fire
was met in full: The fighting did not really end, nor were
independent militias disarmed.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the latest arrangements have argued that the number
of U.N. peacekeepers envisioned is much too small. Congo, the
former Zaire, has 400 times the land mass of Kosovo, with worse
roads and thick forests, and Kosovo has proved a big task for
nearly 40,000 NATO troops, who are generally better trained and
equipped than U.N. peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   However, both pro- and anti-Kabila factions in Congo now appear
militarily weary and financially pressed.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the drama took place during the opening weeks in fall
1998, when the rebels, backed by Ugandan and Rwandan regulars,
managed a startling airborne assault on Kinshasa. They hijacked
planes and used them to ferry troops across the country from the
east to the mouth of the Congo River. But their advance was
repulsed in the capital's suburbs, largely by Zimbabwean troops.
</P>
<P>
   After that defeat, the rebels spread out from the east,
gradually capturing about one-third of the country. But no major
battles have been reported, and the rebels have failed so far in
one important objective: taking the diamond-mining areas around the
southern city of Mbuji-Mayi.
</P>
<P>
   Profits from those mines are allegedly being used to pay the
Zimbabwean government to keep fighting, despite widespread anger in
Zimbabwe over the war's human and economic toll.
</P>
<P>
   Uganda and Rwanda had a falling out last August near the central
city of Kisangani, and their troops fought for two days, leaving
200 dead.
</P>
<P>
   The Ugandan newspaper the Sunday Monitor published an account
Sunday based on interviews with senior Rwandan army officers who
described the August clash as a misunderstanding between friends
that turned violent, not a premeditated attack.
</P>
<P>
   One officer was quoted as saying that some officers from both
armies were playing cards together when the fighting broke out,
that the Rwandans had no doctor with them and would never have
attacked without medical support and that the wounded were all
treated together. ``How could that have happened if we were
enemies?'' Col. James Kadareepe was quoted as asking.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda supported Kabila in his own revolt against Congo's
longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, but turned against him once he
was in power because he sought alliances with Hutu militias that
Rwanda's Tutsi-led government held responsible for 1994 mass
killings in Rwanda. Uganda, too, backed Kabila against Mobutu but
has since turned against him.

RENEWED CONFIDENCE DRIVES SINGH TO FIRST MASTERS TITLE
</HEADLINE>
  By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Vijay Singh used to arrive at the Masters with
trepidation, but he found a way to become its champion.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing fazed Singh on his determined march toward his first
green jacket. He played with precision through howling winds
Saturday. He putted with confidence for four days on greens that
used to confound him. Sunday, he was pursued by some of the best
names in golf _ Ernie Els, David Duval and Tiger Woods. But Singh
never flinched, and never relinquished the lead.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Singh came to Augusta National Golf Club not just to
make the cut, or to contend. Singh came to win. And his confidence,
coupled with his formidable game, carried him to his second major
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Never relinquishing the final-round lead, and calmly navigating
his way through one of golf's most pressure-packed back nines,
Singh won the Masters by three strokes over Els, by four strokes
over Duval and Loren Roberts, and by six strokes over Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting a final-round three-under-par 69, Singh finished at 10
under par for the tournament at 278) to beat Els, who shot a
final-round 68. Roberts shot 69 Sunday but fell short in his bid to
win his first major, as did Duval, who shot 70 and made a costly
bogey at No. 13 after his second shot tumbled into Rae's Creek.
Woods, the world's No. 1 player, shot a final-round 69, and he
never seriously threatened Singh on the back nine.
</P>
<P>
   When Singh won the PGA Championship in 1998, he was overjoyed to
win his first major, proving to himself and to others that he had
the talent to win one of golf's most coveted prizes. But Sunday's
victory will elevate Singh's status even higher, because his best
finish at the Masters in sixth previous tries was a tie for 17th
place in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Never known for his putting prowess, Singh admitted in past
years that he was frustrated by Augusta's speedy and undulating
greens, a fact that made many believe that he would never win the
Masters. But this week, Singh was rock-solid with his putting
stroke, and with his powerful tee-to green game, he charged to the
top of the leaderboard after three rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Once there, Singh played too well for anyone to overtake him. He
had won the Masters. And the feeling was hard to describe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walking up that 18th hole, knowing that a two-putt was going
to win the golf tournament was probably one of the greatest
feelings I've had for a long, long time,'' said Singh, a
38-year-old native of Fiji, who lives in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla.
``Two years ago, I'd have said I can't win this because of the way
I was putting. Augusta's greens are so severe, if you're not a good
putter, you're not going to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm a better putter than I was, and this week was
exceptional, because I drove the ball so well. I was really
confident that with a three-shot lead, as long as I played solid,
they'd have to come up and catch me.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody did catch Singh, who started the final round with a
three-stroke lead, after completing the final four holes of the
third round in the morning, making a key 15-foot putt at No. 17 in
the morning to save par and maintain his three-stroke lead.
</P>
<P>
   But there were several key moments on the back nine that turned
the day in Singh's favor. Paired with Duval in the final group,
Singh reached the par 4 No. 11, the start of the famous three-hole
stretch known as Amen Corner, with a two-stroke lead over Duval.
But Singh made one of his few errors at No. 11, when his pulled his
second shot into the water. But Singh got a break, when his ball
entered the pond from left side, allowing him to drop his ball by
the left side on his next shot, instead of in the penalty drop
area, which was farther away from the pin.
</P>
<P>
   After a penalty stroke, Singh hit a beautiful chip shot that
landed about 3 feet from the pin, then he made the putt to turn
what could have been a double-bogey into just a bogey. That allowed
Singh to keep a one-stroke lead over Duval, who made par at No. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Then at the par 3, No. 12, Singh got another break. His tee shot
sailed over the green into the bushes, but then the ball bounced
out off a slope and back toward the hole, landing in the back
bunker. The bunker shot was far easier than a shot from the bushes
would have been.
</P>
<P>
   Singh got up and down from the bunker for par, and he still led
by one stroke heading to No. 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the kinds of things you need to happen to win,''
said Duval. ``You need those breaks. I didn't get any of those, I
don't feel, at least not big ones like that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Duval could only blame himself for his mistake at the par 5,
No. 13, when he hit his second shot, a 5-iron from 196 yards, into
Rae's Creek. Seconds after the ball left his club, Duval dejectedly
lowered his head, knowing the ball would end up wet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit a poor golf shot,'' Duval said. ``It was the wrong time
to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   After his penalty stroke, Duval chipped onto the green 15 feet
from the hole, but then he missed the putt and made bogey on a hole
that he felt he should have birdied. Meanwhile, Singh did birdie
No. 15, reaching the green in two shots, then two-putting. That
moved Singh to nine under par, while Duval dropped to six. Now
Singh had a three-stroke cushion with five holes to play.
Meanwhile, Els was making a charge in the next-to-last group, with
birdies at No. 13 and No. 15 to reach seven under par, two strokes
off the lead. But Els missed three birdie attempts on the final
three holes _ from 9 feet on No, 16, 15 feet on No. 17, and 12 feet
on No. 18. On the final putt at No. 18, Els was forced to back away
just before he was about to putt, when a photographer's shutter
clicked and broke Els' concentration.
</P>
<P>
   Els went through his pre-shot routine again, but he was visibly
upset, and his anger increased after he missed the putt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if I had made the putt I might have still lost, but I
would have at least given Vijay a chance to think about,'' said
Singh. ``That guy should never take a golf picture again in his
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I misread a putt on No. 16, and on No. 18, I hit it too
hard through the break. It wasn't meant to be for me this week.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was meant to be for Singh. Though he three-putted No. 16
for bogey, he still led Duval by two strokes with two holes to
play. Then Singh hit a great approach shot on No. 17 to secure his
par, then after Duval could only make par on No. 17, Singh came to
No. 18 with a two-stroke lead. Then when his approach shot at No.
18 landed on the green, Singh strolled up the final fairway and
soaked in the applause, knowing he would join an exclusive club.
</P>
<P>
   What did Singh think when he looked down at his new jacket,
which is traditionally awarded to the Masters champion? ``I just
love the color green,'' said Singh. &QL;

COMMENTARY: HUMAN INTEREST RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH , Fla. _ Assume the deal goes through: Custody
of Elian Gonzalez goes to his Cuban communist father after he
agrees that he will not take the boy out of the United States until
court appeals end. The 6-year-old's Cuban-American relatives agree
to turn him over after the Justice Department guarantees that the
father will stick around for the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what this four-month immersion in a media bath teaches
us:
</P>
<P>
   1. Flight from tyranny still has a powerful moral and emotional
appeal. When the mother died in her attempt to choose freedom for
herself and her son, the initial U.S. public reaction was to grant
him asylum. His relatives here were right to claim and protect him;
communist charges that the fleeing mother kidnapped her boy were
ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
   2. The father's claim pitted parental control in a tyranny
against care by relatives in a free country. In such a clash of
values, thoughtful people can disagree. But anti-communists saw
only a Castro ploy to whip up anti-U.S. sentiment in Cuba. And
liberal anti-anti-communists here (who might have resisted
returning a motherless child to a Nazi father and Hitler Youth)
found an opportunity to vent their distaste at the political
strength of those opposed to extending an economic lifeline to
Castro.
</P>
<P>
   3. When Republican presidential candidates put the dead mother's
desire for her child's freedom ahead of the live father's claim of
custody, the Democratic-leaning states of Florida and New Jersey _
with sizable Cuban-American voting blocs _ were put in play. That
forced Al Gore to break with the Clinton decision to return the boy
to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   4. When the Democratic candidate takes a stand that aligns him
with conservatives, he is castigated by liberals as a shameless
panderer. This causes some embarrassment now and generates much
media derision, but costs him little in the long run; Gore's most
virulent leftist critics today will come home to him in November.
Practical Democrats understand and are silently pleased at the
prospect of making inroads into a Republican stronghold.
</P>
<P>
   5. Firebrands in Miami's Cuban-American community overplayed
their hand. Angry televised demonstrations; human chains and talk
of civil disobedience; the Miami-Dade County mayor's foolish threat
to withhold local police protection to U.S. marshals _ all this,
exploited by background briefings from Bill Clinton's media-savvy
impeachment lawyer, helped Castro make a martyr out of the father.
Refugees traditionally take pains to uphold their welcoming
country's rule of law; by the time cooler Hispanic heads prevailed,
the majority of U.S. public opinion had turned.
</P>
<P>
   6. Human interest now easily beats political interest and
sometimes even national interest. We have seen how television film
warped U.S. policy that had been to destroy Iraq's republican
guard; other pictures of suffering created our protection of an
exodus of endangered Kurds. Pictures of the arrival of Juan
Gonzalez, tenderly cradling an infant in his arms and accompanied
by his new wife, bolstered the image of a caring father and eroded
the hopes of the drowned mother. That helped undermine legitimate
concerns that Elian would be brainwashed in a communist school and
made into a poster child of anti-U.S. propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   7. The concern for the unity of a nuclear family divided
conservatives. A communist real father may be better than a
democratic substitute father; a natural family unit in a tyranny
may be better for a child than a split family anywhere. That virtue
of family cohesion, added to the newly equal parental rights of
fathers, made it hard for conservative hawks on human rights to
adopt the certitude taken with such ease by the crowd of
immigration bureaucrats, Justice politicians, Castro appeasers and
their unconflicted editorial supporters.
</P>
<P>
   8. It's working out for the best. The United States shows again
that individual rights come first, and only the courts decide them.
Anti-Castroites in Congress will pass a law granting Elian and
family permanent residence here if and when they are free to so
choose. Cuban-Americans now know their political strength and its
limits.
</P>
<P>
   As for the celebrated kid, pawn he may be, but Elian is off to a
fast political start. By 2030, in a democratic hemisphere, he could
face a choice of running for president of Cuba or mayor of Miami.

RENO SIGNALS SHOWDOWN IN FATE OF CUBAN BOY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla.)   (Eds.: With CUBAN-FATHER) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno said Sunday that she
was determined to reunite Elian Gonzalez with his father this week,
signaling a likely showdown in the international custody battle
over the 6-year-old Cuban boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each day that goes by only hurts him, and I think we must get
it resolved as soon as possible,'' Reno said on the ABC News
program ``This Week,'' referring to the boy who was rescued from
the Atlantic Ocean off Florida last Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, who has
temporary custody of the boy, had sent a letter to Reno asking her
to tentatively schedule a meeting on Monday in Miami with a
psychiatric panel, although he complained that the three-member
team did not plan to meet with Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Reno had asked for the meeting with the doctors to discuss how
to transfer the child with minimum trauma, but it remained
uncertain whether the meeting would occur because Gonzalez said
that he wanted his daughter, who is in the hospital, to attend.
</P>
<P>
   In two television interviews Sunday, Reno would not discuss
specifics of how immigration officials planned to take custody of
the boy. Justice Department officials are wary of any use of force.
Reno said that she wanted to arrange a transfer that was not
disruptive.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of supporters have gathered outside the Gonzalez home
in Miami in a peaceful vigil that authorities believe could turn
violent if the relatives resisted the government's order to turn
over the boy.
</P>
<P>
   That order, shifting custody of Elian from his great-uncle to
his father, will likely be issued Monday afternoon or Tuesday and
would probably set a deadline of later in the week, government
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the relatives have repeatedly said they would obey
the law, but have been unwilling to negotiate the terms under which
they will relinquish custody.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have accused the relatives' lawyers of
stalling in the face of lawful directives granting custody to
Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez. Lawyers for the relatives
have said the government has not allowed the appeals courts time to
consider Elian's legal rights.
</P>
<P>
   In another television appearance, Eric H. Holder Jr., Reno's
deputy, said the Justice Department would, if the relatives handed
over the boy, try to persuade the father to remain in the United
States with his son pending the outcome of an appeal in federal
court.
</P>
<P>
   The court is not considering whether Elian should remain in the
United States but whether his Miami relatives may file a political
asylum claim on his behalf. Government lawyers have said they are
confident of the Justice Department's authority to return the boy
to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Asked on the NBC News program ``Meet the Press'' whether the
government was prepared to take the child by force, Holder said
that the authorities believed it was unlikely that the relatives
would refuse to hand over the boy. But he said, ``We will do what
is necessary to reunite father and son.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father met Sunday with the three-member psychiatric
group, but his lawyer, Gregory B. Craig, would not discuss what was
said.

   LOS ANGELES _ The San Francisco Giants' home opener at their new
launching pad (against the Dodgers) on Tuesday has been sold out
for months, and it's no wonder why. It's the
instant-millionaire-rich Silicon Valley showing us the way.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal reported last week that nearly halfof
all the San Francisco Giants' single-game tickets were told over
the Internet on their Web site (www.sfgiants.com). In addition, 15
percent of the 30,000 season seats were Web-generated.
</P>
<P>
   That is what helped the team sell out 73 of 81 home dates.
</P>
<P>
   -New England Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe has become the
first major pro athlete to start his own Internet service provider
- Bledsoenet.com - which he told the Boston Globe was started so
that parents of young kids can have a certain level of comfort
knowing that access to sites to pornography and hate crime, for
example, will be filtered out.
</P>
<P>
   -Santa Monica-based Broadband Sports, which includes
AthletesDirect.com among its properties, announced that it reached
a deal with Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones to be the new
designer, producer and manager of the team's official site
(www.dallascowboys.com).
</P>
<P>
   Jones, famous for his anti-establishment business dealings, was
one of two who recently voted against the NFL's decision to combine
all Internet revenue under one umbrella company and split profits
evenly among the teams. Broadband says the agreement is structured
to comply with the principles of the NFL's Internet guidelines and
does not violate any recently passed provisions regarding the
operation of team sites.
</P>
<P>
   -If the 9-to-5 workweek has lost its luster, shop over at
JobsInSports.com. There's a database that, for $29.95 a month, will
list hundreds of sports jobs and internships, updated each week.
Positions in marketing, administration and sales are the norm but
are quickly being supplanted with Web site and other multimedia
careers.

RULES FOR NEWS HOUNDS ON HEELS OF ELIAN'S FATHER

<P>
   BETHESDA, Md. _ Please don't pick the cherry blossoms. Turn off
those portable generators after 9 p.m.; the children need to sleep.
But do buy their lemonade and ices; business at the stands is
usually slow. Come in for coffee but don't throw the cups on the
road.
</P>
<P>
   These are rules for the news-media pack chasing Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, who has stayed here at the suburban home of Cuba's chief
diplomat since arriving on Thursday from Cuba to reclaim his son,
Elian Gonzalez, and end an international custody fight.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps only a suburb of Washington stocked with diplomats,
politicos and journalists would be so good-natured about a news
media invasion.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 television satellite trucks line the streets of the
Kenwood Park neighborhood here. An equal number of cameras are
trained on a certain beige brick split-level on Millwood Road, and
a few dozen journalists camp round-the-clock (in case Gonzalez
defects at 3 a.m.).
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors have witnessed vigils and demonstrations _ journalists
outnumbered protesters at the most recent. Cameras and microphones
record everyone who enters or leaves the house and stampede after
anyone who might make news.
</P>
<P>
   It is, of course, a two-way street. One resident put a soda
machine on his driveway. Another serves coffee and doughnuts from
her kitchen table and offers tidbits on the diplomats who give the
neighborhood an international flare.
</P>
<P>
   There have been complaints about barricades, noise and crushed
spring grass. But people generally have been accommodating, said
Lt. William O'Toole, a spokesman for the Montgomery County Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the media does not really bother me,'' said Kitty Strauss,
who lives around the corner from the house and took on the moniker
``the bathroom lady'' for obvious reasons. ``It could last a month,
six months, a year, but my life is eventually going back to normal.
I don't think Elian's is.''

CLEMENS HAS POOR OUTING AFTER HEARING ABOUT MENTOR'S ILLNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ They have been through this so many times before, the
terrible news delivered in a team meeting, the Yankees emerging
somberly. Darryl Strawberry was diagnosed with cancer, and then
Manager Joe Torre, and now the pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre. You
push ahead because that's what you must do, Torre said Sunday,
after Stottlemyre revealed he has a form of blood cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees played Sunday and played badly, losing to the
Seattle Mariners, 9-3, Roger Clemens surrendering seven runs, one
earned, in six innings. After winning the first two games to open
the season, the Yankees lost three of the last four games of the
six-game trip and return to play the first game in Yankee Stadium
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers and their pitching coaches sometimes communicate like
spouses, Andy Pettitte said Sunday. Clemens formed a bond with
Stottlemyre in the 13 months since Toronto traded him to the
Yankees, a friendship formed in the many hours of tinkering in the
bullpen, discussing scouting reports, arm slots, fastball grips and
pitching mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   When Clemens learned in March that he was going to pitch the
first game in Houston's new ballpark, Enron Field, part of his
delight stemmed from the fact that Stottlemyre had pitched the
first game in Houston's Astrodome in 1965. Clemens wanted to
acquire a game program from that day 35 years ago, for Stottlemyre
to autograph; then Clemens intended to get a Enron Field program,
with Clemens' signature, and mount both programs, side-by-side.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens learned of Stottlemyre's illness as most of his
teammates did, in a meeting conducted by Torre, who offered a brief
synopsis before encouraging the players to take questions to
Stottlemyre. Clemens did so, speaking with Stottlemyre about a half
hour before he was scheduled to warm up, and as always, Stottlemyre
was standing next to Clemens as he threw in the bullpen, coach and
player. They walked in from the bullpen together, Stottlemyre
veering off to toss the warmup ball to a young boy wearing a
Yankees uniform in the second row of the stands in left field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's somebody that you care about, and you know he cares about
you as a person,'' Clemens said. ``I consider him a mentor,
watching over what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens had great stuff, as he did in his first start last week,
his fastball thumping into the mitt of the catcher Jorge Posada,
and Jamie Moyer, the Seattle starter, was just as good in his own
way, confusing the Yankees' hitters with his changeup. There were
no hits in the first two and a half innings.
</P>
<P>
   An error by Derek Jeter led to the Mariners' first run, Mike
Cameron scoring Carlos Guillen on an infield single, but Jeter and
Chuck Knoblauch hit back-to-back doubles in the fourth and the
Yankees moved ahead, 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   But an error on a disputed call created a trouble for the
Yankees in the fifth, and Clemens was unable to avoid damage. Torre
said afterward that Clemens sometimes tries too hard to be perfect,
rather than concede a little. After Dan Wilson led off with a
single, Guillen bunted the ball in front of the plate and Posada
rushed out, picked up the ball and underhanded a throw to first,
where the second baseman Chuck Knoblauch was covering.
</P>
<P>
   Posada's throw was offline and Knoblauch stretched to make the
catch. Posada turned around and headed back toward his position,
satisfied the play was made _ until the roaring of the crowd spun
him around. Ted Barrett, the first base umpire, ruled that Guillen
was safe, saying that Knoblauch's foot had come off the bag. Torre
and others argued, to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt in my mind he was out,'' Posada said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Knoblauch: ``I didn't see a replay, but I don't need to see
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark McLemore, the next hitter, then attempted to bunt, but
Clemens walked him, loading the bases _ an example of how Clemens
might have been better off just conceding the bunt and getting the
out, as Torre said. ``With the successes he's had,'' said Torre,
``he still thinks he's capable of superhuman things.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens broke the bat of the next hitter, Mike Cameron, but the
Seattle center fielder lifted a looper that barely nicked off the
glove of a leaping Knoblauch, a run-scoring single. Single runs
scored on outs by Alex Rodriguez and John Olerud, but Edgar
Martinez prolonged the inning with a run-scoring single and Jay
Buhner blasted a two-run homer to right. Six runs in the inning, in
all, and the game was effectively over.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did a pretty good job of attacking him,'' Stottlemyre
said. ``The bunt play was a big play, as they always are in a close
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte had gotten a sense Stottlemyre was ailing over the last
year, after Stottlemyre vaguely mentioned doctors' appointments. He
and Stottlemyre often fished together when the Yankees came here,
but that was impossible last year, he said, because Stottlemyre
needed to undergo tests.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte said he would have had a difficult time pitching Sunday
after learning the exact nature of Stottlemyre's illness, but
Clemens rejected the suggestion that he was distracted. That's not
what Stottlemyre wants, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as Clemens spoke of Stottlemyre, his response was
steeled. It seemed hard for him to share his feelings. He thought
of Stottlemyre throwing batting practice to the pitchers in spring
training, sweating but happy in his work, coping all the while with
the knowledge that he might have cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's kept it to himself and not allowed it to interfere with
what we do on a daily basis,'' Clemens said. ``That just shows the
strength that he has. We're just going to have to watch how this
evolves over the next couple of months. What we're hoping and
praying for is the best to happen.''

COMMENTARY: TAKE A DEEP BREATH 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Word in bold should be set in italics.) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the beginning of 1995, Houston, Dallas-Fort Worth and a
couple of other smog-choked urban centers in Texas had a fledgling
emissions testing program in place that was designed to curtail
pollution from cars and trucks. Ground-level ozone readings had
reached alarming levels, especially in Houston, and the testing
program was developed by the state to meet federal clear-air
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   But even though the air in Houston was changing the perception
of children about the color of the sky and the experience of
breathing, the testing program was not popular with motorists. It
was inconvenient. Texans, like most Americans, like to gas up and
go. No time for inspections. And the program was anathema to the
chattering hysterics of talk radio. If there was one thing they
understood, it was polluted air.
</P>
<P>
   Houston might have had a problem in 1995, might even have been
disappearing in an increasingly toxic haze, but that was a matter
best dealt with later. Sure, some of the weaker types _ the
asthmatics, the elderly _ were gasping and wheezing, but that
happens. The immediate issue was how to get rid of the tests.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the brand-new governor of Texas, George W. Bush. He was
now in charge of appointments to the agency that had gone through
the excruciating and expensive work of gearing up the emissions
testing program, the Texas Natural Resources Conservation
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Bush agreed with the angry motorists and the talk-radio crowd.
It wasn't that he was against clean air, he said. He just didn't
think motorists should be inconvenienced. And he sure didn't like
the  &UR; federales &LR;  in Washington telling Texans what to do.
</P>
<P>
   The first legislation Bush signed as governor was a bill that
put the emissions tests on hold. It didn't matter that the program
was ready to go, that the contracts had been signed and an enormous
cadre of workers hired by the contractors, and that dozens of
gleaming new inspection stations were all set to open.
</P>
<P>
   Meant nothing. The state legislature passed the moratorium and
the governor signed it. And that was just the beginning. The
program would soon be killed. Texas was not yet ready to grapple
with the reality of air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   At a legislative hearing in March 1995, the Rev. Aubrey Vaughan,
head of a group misleadingly called Citizens for a Cleaner Houston,
railed against the emissions tests, claiming, according to an
account in The Houston Chronicle, that there was no evidence of an
ozone problem in Houston, and no scientific evidence that ozone is
a health threat.
</P>
<P>
   The reverend declared that God is the ``only one who can control
pollution problems.'' And he observed that ``a good, hard, steady
rain would help us all.''
</P>
<P>
   When the state formally scrapped the testing program later in
the year it not only turned its back on an increasingly serious
health hazard, it reneged on its multimillion-dollar contract with
the lead contractor for the program, Tejas Testing Technology,
which would eventually go bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Tejas sued and won. A settlement of $140 million was worked out,
and the way the state raised the money said a lot about the way
Bush and other top state officials view the environment in Texas.
They raided the state's environmental programs _ critical programs
like the superfund for cleaning up contaminated sites and the Texas
clean air fund _ for $130 million of the $140 million they were
forced to pay to Tejas.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the environment in Texas was twice punished _
first, when the inspection program was killed and again when the
lawsuit was settled.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the air quality problems in Texas have only gotten
worse. Houston is now the smoggiest city in America, having roared
past the longtime champ, Los Angeles, for that gruesome
distinction. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has rejected
as inadequate the latest clean air proposals from Texas and is
threatening to cut off billions of dollars in highway funds and
impose Draconian cleanup measures.
</P>
<P>
   And get this _ state officials now think it might be a good idea
to come up with a stringent vehicle emissions testing program.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, George W. Bush is running for president, declaring
himself an environmentalist and promising to do for the rest of us
what he has done so well in Texas.

BLAKE GETS BACK TO PLAYING HIS PART
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM - Kings captain Rob Blake could have sat out the
regular-season finale. His left knee is that bad.
</P>
<P>
   But he played, and it involved more than just playing the cross-
town Ducks on Sunday or the chance to get in some real ice time
before the first round of the playoffs begins Thursday in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a team standpoint, he wanted to be a part of the group,''
coach Andy Murray said after the Kings won 4-3 in overtime. ``There
are a few days before the playoffs begin, but there are still a lot
of positive things to do before then.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake gave the Kings a 3-2 lead at the 3:56 mark of the third
period. The Ducks tied the game five minutes later on Teemu
Selanne's second goal of the game. Blake's goal was important. It
was his 18th of the year, but he hadn't scored since March 13 and
had just one goal in his last 18 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think getting that goal puts him right back in the middle of
everything,'' defense mate Mattias Norstrom said. ``It was probably
more important to get back in the flow of things after missing a
week. But the goal sure was nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake was injured during the second period of last Saturday's
2-1 playoff clincher at Staples Center. He tried to take out Ted
Donato coming across the middle; the two clipped knees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really was a dumb play on my part,'' Blake said. ``I had a
chance to give it some rest, but it definitely was time to get
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Power play: The Kings finished the season 5 for 11 on the power
play in the last three games. In March the team was 5 for 59 and
during one stretch did not score in 36 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Blake's goal came with the Ducks' Stu Grimson off for
interference. He turned around at the right faceoff circle and let
go a shot that sailed through the legs of Ducks goaltender Guy
Hebert.
</P>
<P>
   In overtime, Glen Murray also beat Hebert through the legs after
defenseman Oleg Tverdovsky was whistled for high-sticking Ian
Laperriere.
</P>
<P>
   ``The power play is so important during the playoffs,'' Blake
said. ``Fewer penalties are called and you have to take advantage
of the opportunities. We had some trouble recently, but now things
seem to be falling into place. Couldn't happen at a better time.''

<P>
   SUAN PHUNG, Thailand _ Between them, the 12-year-old twins say,
they command 400,000 invisible soldiers. If anybody shoots at them,
the bullets just bounce off. And they can kill their enemies simply
by pointing a rifle at the ground and concentrating really hard.
</P>
<P>
   These might be the fantasies of a million schoolboys. But they
are the beliefs that have led grown men into battle _ the legends
that surround two child warriors who lead a ragged ethnic
insurgency called God's Army, just across the border in Myanmar,
the former Burma.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, one of the twins, Luther Htoo, went on a four-day
hike with 15 of his soldiers from his mountain hideout to the hills
along the border for his first interview since God's Army carried
out a suicidal raid on a Thai hospital in January.
</P>
<P>
   He met with Jason Bleibtreu, an American photographer and video
cameraman, and spoke with The New York Times by satellite telephone
_ a fidgety child with a little-boy voice who answered many of the
questions by turning to his followers and asking, ``What shall I
say?''
</P>
<P>
   After some discussion, some of his answers were these: He wants
freedom for his people, the Karen minority. He is invulnerable to
land mines and bullets. His favorite toys are real guns and
ammunition. And he misses his mother and father.
</P>
<P>
   On videotape he seems more like a spoiled mascot than a general:
He is carried through the woods on the shoulders of his men handed
a lighted cheroot whenever he murmurs, ``I want a smoke,'' and
tolerated benignly as he climbs in and out of the laps of the men
he commands.
</P>
<P>
   He sports a camouflage fatigue shirt with a ``U.S. Army'' patch,
a ``Love'' tattoo on his arm, and a new short haircut, and he turns
away from time to time to double over in a wrenching smoker's
cough.
</P>
<P>
   Luther and his brother, Johnny, did not join the January raid,
in which all 10 gunmen were shot dead after taking hostage more
than 800 patients and staff at a hospital in the town of
Ratchaburi. But the chain-smoking twins, with their long hair,
vacant expressions and claims of divinity, became the objects of
widespread curiosity abroad.
</P>
<P>
   They also became the targets of a stepped-up hunt by the Burmese
military, found themselves barred from their potential sanctuary in
Thailand and lost the support of other Karen rebels, who are now
under increased pressure on both sides of the border as a result of
the disastrous raid.
</P>
<P>
   On the run and short of food, the fighters say, God's Army has
split into three small groups. The twins, leading two of the
groups, now talk to each other only by hand-held radio. Altogether,
their men say, they command fewer than 200 fighters.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate interview here in a Thai border village, one of
the boys' followers, a 45-year-old guerrilla, talked at length
about the insurgency and the extraordinary legends that have grown
up around the Htoo twins.
</P>
<P>
   Using the Karen term ``bu,'' or ``little brother,'' he referred
to Luther as Bu Lu and to Johnny as Bu Joh, and he was careful to
note which miracles he claimed to have witnessed and which he had
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once, when Bu Joh was bathing in a stream, he shouted to
everybody, `Look at me!' and he jumped into the water,'' said the
guerrilla, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he came out he was an old man with long white hair and a
white beard,'' he said. ``All the soldiers were afraid, but he
said, `Don't be afraid: I'm Bu Joh! If you don't believe me, I'll
change back.' And he jumped back into the water and came out as a
boy again. I didn't see this myself, but more than 100 soldiers did
see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Several other incidents described by the guerrilla also suggest
that the boys are constantly proving their powers to skeptics.
</P>
<P>
   In one incident that he said he did witness, Luther gave each
fighter three magic bullets but admonished them to save them for
emergencies. One doubter disobeyed and shot one of the bullets at a
tree. When he checked the tree, there were 10 bullet holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that, he believed,'' the guerrilla said.
</P>
<P>
   In another incident, Luther sent his men into battle but
remained where he was, pointing his rifle silently at the ground.
Afterward he asked how many of the enemy had been killed. Twenty,
he was told. He then held up his rifle; exactly 20 bullets had
disappeared from its magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Legends like that challenge the imagination of most people,
including most other ethnic Karens. But one Karen student in
Bangkok, who is not a follower of God's Army, said he was ready to
believe that the boys are reincarnations of heroes from the past.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of charismatic holy men with claims to magical
powers ``is fairly common in Southeast Asia in times of trouble,''
said Sunai Phasuk, a Thai political scientist who has studied the
God's Army phenomenon. ``They don't have other sources of
reference, they don't have support from authorities, and they don't
have a big army, so they turn to supernatural beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Karens have been fighting a separatist insurgency since
Burma became independent of British colonial rule a half-century
ago. Most other ethnic groups have reached an accommodation with
the government in the last decade, but some Karens have continued
to fight. The emergence of God's Army in the last three years is a
sign of divisions and desperation as the Karens suffer defeat after
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Movements like God's Army are similar to end-of-the-world
movements that predict an imminent apocalypse, Sunai said. And
indeed, the guerrilla fighter quoted Luther as saying, ``Please
believe me, not too long from now the world will explode.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Like some other movements of this kind, God's Army lives by
ascetic rules. Although smoking is obviously permitted, alcohol,
drugs and adultery are banned, along with milk, eggs and pork. Many
Karens are Christian, and the boys are said to know the Bible by
heart, although they have never studied it.
</P>
<P>
   What is unusual about God's Army is that it is led, at least
nominally, by children.
</P>
<P>
   Their fighting force includes a number of other child soldiers,
the guerrilla said, many of them orphans of the war. Indeed, he
said, with God's Army split into three groups, a third 12-year-old
leader with magical powers has emerged. His name is Chopa Thupli,
or King of the Black Tongue.
</P>
<P>
   This boy, the guerrilla said, is actually 200 years old, a Thai
king who once fought against the Burmese and decided to return as a
Karen so that he could keep on fighting them.
</P>
<P>
   His divinity is believed to be shown by the black color of his
tongue, a sign among some people here of magical powers. The
guerrilla said the twins do not have black tongues, as others have
reported, and Bleibtreu also said it did not appear that Luther had
a black tongue.
</P>
<P>
   But the twins are also reincarnations of past leaders, with a
direct connection to heaven, the guerrilla said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny _ the funny, talkative one _ was born first and goes
everywhere first, he said, even though Luther has greater divine
powers. The difference is measured in the size of the armies they
command: Luther has 250,000 invisible heavenly soldiers while
Johnny has 150,000.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems that Johnny commands more of the everyday kind of
soldier. According to the guerrilla, he has about 100 fighters, who
protect some 300 civilian followers, apparently including the boys'
parents.
</P>
<P>
   Luther has about 30 fighters, although in the interview he had
to ask a subordinate for the number.
</P>
<P>
   The boys' parents are simple farmers without magical powers, the
guerrilla said. When the boys became leaders, their father put down
his hoe and took up a gun to follow them. And now, if he is in need
of special help, the guerrilla said, the boys will detach a
contingent of invisible soldiers to assist him.
</P>
<P>
   In their meeting with Bleibtreu on Thursday, the guerrillas _
both boys and men _ carried an assortment of M-16 and AK-47 rifles
and grenade launchers. They wore fatigues, shorts and a Donald Duck
T-shirt along with black head scarves and rubber sandals. Some were
barefoot.
</P>
<P>
   The deep forest was filled with bird song, the buzz of insects
and the constant dry coughing of the fighters.
</P>
<P>
   There was only one moment when gunfire seemed a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can shoot a weapon _ would you like me to show you?'' Luther
said to his visitor, but his soldiers told him, ``No, no, better
not, because the Burmese army might hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Bleibtreu said the soldiers seemed to treat the boy with a mix
of deference and patient parenting.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wouldn't allow him to act upon all of his whims,'' he
said. ``Sometimes he would want to ride on someone's shoulders. He
would motion, lift me up, lift me up, and they would talk him out
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   There seemed to be nothing extraordinary about this 12-year-old,
apart perhaps from his childishness.
</P>
<P>
   ``What struck me most was he seemed to want attention, emotional
contact,'' Bleibtreu said. ``He wanted more hugs from his mother.
He would sit down with me and put his hand on my shoulder. I got
the feeling he wanted me to hug him. He would jump from soldier to
soldier to their laps. The other boys weren't doing this. I felt
sad, as a father: jeez, this kid wants a hug.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, though, the atmosphere darkened for a moment as
Luther seemed to grow annoyed at the constant questions. ``He
yelled out, and everyone was quiet. It was almost like a bark, and
it was quite clear it was `Stop badgering me!' I was surprised, and
I was taken aback by it, and the people took it fairly seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the videotape, the group pauses in silence as one
of the fighters leads a prayer. And Luther, the holy man, could be
any child _ perhaps a 6-year-old child _ shifting and squirming in
boredom.
</P>
<P>
   Comfortably cradled in the lap of a tough-looking guerrilla, the
boy yawns and rubs his eyes. Then he rubs his face. Then with an
effort he sits forward and closes his eyes in an attempt at
concentration. Then he begins playing with a canteen cup, wiggling
its handle. Finally, as the men sing a closing hymn, Luther blinks
himself back to attention and joins in for a word or two.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrilla who is holding him seems used to this. He pays no
attention.

ANALYSIS: AWARD IN MIAMI TOBACCO SUIT LEADS TO UNEXPECTED TWISTS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla., Calif., N.Y., Miss.)   (Eds.: The following story, previously eliminated, is now
restored.) 
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Consider the smoking case now unfolding in Miami as Exhibit A in
the increasingly strange looking-glass world of tobacco litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the six-member jury in the class-action lawsuit
awarded $12.7 million to three people chosen to represent hundreds
of thousands of Florida residents who smoked. The same panel will
next decide whether to award damages to punish tobacco producers
for their conduct, a sum that because of the size of the class
could reach into the tens of billions.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the case's outcome, it has already produced some
unexpected twists. State lawmakers who recently vilified cigarette
makers as profiteers hawking a deadly product are now pressing to
protect industry profits so they can continue to receive lawsuit
settlement payments worth $246 billion to the states.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette makers, who decried the state lawsuits as little more
than legal shakedowns, have also changed their tune. Now, in
arguments to jurors like those in the Miami case, they point to
settlement concessions as evidence that they have agreed to change
their practices and so don't need to be further punished.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Sugarman, a law professor at the University of California
at Berkeley, said these strange turnabouts were not coincidental.
When the first state lawsuits to recover smoking-related health
care costs were filed in 1994, the tobacco industry was considered
not only legally impregnable but also financially ripe for legal
plucking.
</P>
<P>
   A few years and $246 billion later, Sugarman said, that may no
longer be the case. ``Suddenly, instead of there being a goose with
an unlimited number of golden eggs, people are thinking there may
be only so many eggs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, those with a hold on the honey pot are defending it
against newcomers like the lawyers pressing the Miami case. Neither
individual lawsuits nor class-action cases like the one in Florida
were settled by the resolution of the state actions.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years ago, for instance, Florida lawmakers removed
legal roadblocks to the state's lawsuit against cigarette makers.
The result: an industry settlement worth $13 billion over the next
two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Florida Legislature is again considering the tobacco
industry. But this time, it is reviewing ways to blunt the possible
impact of a verdict in the Miami case on the ability of companies
to make continuing settlement payments.
</P>
<P>
   All of this has made for some awkward moments for state
officials. Last year, Bob Butterworth, the Florida attorney general
who filed the state's cigarette case, cheered when the Miami jury
returned a verdict finding tobacco makers guilty of ``outrageous
conduct'' in misrepresenting the dangers of their product, a
finding that sets the stage for punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   But now with the case heading that way, Butterworth's cheers
have apparently turned into cold sweat, and he is among those
consulting with state lawmakers looking for ways to rein in the
Miami case.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the problem, legal experts say, is that most
people _ state lawmakers, cigarette company officials and others _
never expected the Miami case to survive. Courts have disbanded
most class-action tobacco cases, and tobacco company lawyers tried
their utmost to have this one dismissed. Against all odds, however,
it has survived.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette companies say they still believe that a higher Florida
court will eventually dismiss the case. But Bob Rabin, a law
professor at New York University, said that because punitive
damages would be awarded in the case before producers could get
such a ruling, they might choose to settle it, given what is at
stake if they failed to have it thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is kind of a protracted version of the tobacco industry's
nightmare that legal uncertainty will never end,'' Rabin said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that there would also be settlement pressure on the
plaintiffs' lawyer leading the class action, Stanley Rosenblatt of
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   That is because the mechanics of resolving hundreds of thousands
of individual claims with the case will take years or decades, time
that the tobacco producers can use to further their legal appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Robert P. Kaye of Florida Circuit Court, who presides over
the Miami lawsuit, has not indicated how he will deal with punitive
damages when jurors take up the issue in a few weeks. While the
jury will make an award on behalf of the entire class, he may
choose to enter only a portion of the award.
</P>
<P>
   Under Florida law, producers will have to post a bond equal to
the amount of the judgment entered plus interest while they appeal
it.
</P>
<P>
   But while some lawmakers fret, others with a new stake in the
tobacco industry's financial well-being said they were not very
concerned about the Miami suit. Dick Scruggs, a lawyer from
Mississippi who represented some 30 states in their action against
producers, said he believed some legislation would soon emerge from
the Florida Legislature to lower the case's possible impact.
</P>
<P>
   Scruggs, whose law firm expects to receive nearly $1 billion in
legal fees from the settlements, said he was told that Florida
lawmakers were looking at capping the appeal bond a company has to
post and limiting the amount of punitive damages that a defendant
would have to pay out in any single year.
</P>
<P>
   Told that it would be several weeks before the Miami jury took
up the question of punitive damages, Scruggs appeared relieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good,'' he said. ``That gives us a couple of weeks.''

AGASSI AND SAMPRAS FINALLY BRING ENERGY TO U.S. TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ They had seen this act before, here at the
Great Western Forum. Two very different stars, as players and
people, orchestrating Showtime, lighting up the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Agassi was Magic. Pete Sampras was Kareem. Agassi revved
up the crowd with his energy and wizardry. Sampras punctuated the
day with his special brand of hooks and slams. The United States
dream team of Davis Cup singles was finally together, in concert,
and so up to the task that John McEnroe could have left the court
and gone to sit with one of the attending celebrities, Captain
Kirk.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe's second tie at the helm of the United States team was,
in the end, a replication of the first, except it was Sampras in
for Chris Woodruff, finally finishing off a feisty little country
that did not know its place. After Agassi cracked the Jiri Novak
code, winning by 6-3, 6-3, 6-1, Sampras turned lights out on the
Czech Republic, with a 6-4, 6-4, 7-6 (2) drubbing of Slava Dosedel
that was no more compelling than a bedtime kiss.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it looked like, however long it took, McEnroe's team
was on to the semifinals, in Spain July 21 to 23 with a 3-2 victory
over the Czech Republic. What we originally expected here was what
we got. After annoying McEnroe with a lack of fire in his
straight-sets loss to Novak last Friday, Sampras did what he does
best. Shoulders stooped, wiping beads of sweat from his brow, he
policed the hard court with Wimbledon law, with his Grade A
unreturnable serve.
</P>
<P>
   He served as high as 129 miles per hour, and his second serve
was typically faster than Dosedel's first. Sampras faced
triple-break point in the fourth game of the first set, already up
a break on Dosedel. In rapid succession, he lined up a service
winner, a second-service ace, another service winner, a service
winner down the T, and a second-service winner. End of game. End of
Dosedel's chance to establish himself as a threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never played the fifth match in Davis Cup,'' Sampras
said. ``It was time to remember who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   He injured his quad muscle in the first game, had it treated
twice during changeovers during the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suck it up,'' McEnroe told him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `I'm going to do what I can,''' Sampras said,
adding, ``I could see it in his eye that he didn't want any part of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   He laughed, in the context of McEnroe's criticism of him the
previous day. McEnroe wondered where the energy was, why he didn't
throw his body onto the hard court. McEnroe, Sampras understood,
was just being McEnroe, fueling a potentially flammable situation,
unable to stop himself.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras said it wasn't as if didn't try against Novak. It was a
bad day at the office, the home office, in the city he is from.
</P>
<P>
   His friends were at the Forum this weekend, as was his family,
including his father, Sam, which is about as rare as a
straight-sets Sampras defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was down in the dumps on Friday night,'' he said. ``It was
more than a loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi, who hugged him afterward, came into the interview room
and, along with the losing American doubles team, defended his
career-long rival and character opposite. ``You know, all we can do
is our best out there and Jiri played the match of his life against
Pete,'' Agassi said. ``Pete's accomplishments speak for themselves,
so at the risk of sounding like I'm criticizing John, I have no
idea what he could possibly mean.''
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe insisted he didn't mean anything personal by it. He was
just being captain, just coaching. like another high profile mentor
who once prowled the same Forum sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   That was before Pat Riley became so infatuated by success that
he became The Windbag Within, making every post-analysis a lecture
on work ethic. In effect, both Agassi and Sampras agreed with the
Czech captain, Jan Kukal, who predicted prosperity for Captain
McEnroe, with a more experience and the understanding that he's not
playing and it's a players' game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's part of, unfortunately, not being able to make more of
a difference than giving us a platform to do well by preparation,''
Agassi said.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing, meanwhile, that Kukal could have done for
Novak against Agassi. Against any other player, perhaps even
Sampras again, the stubborn Novak would have not gone in straight
sets. But Agassi was entirely another proposition, all wound up
with the crowd charged up.
</P>
<P>
   Kukal had warned, ``Be careful of Jiri - iron is his best
friend,'' meaning the weight room. Agassi, more the outdoorsman
when he runs up what he calls Magic Mountain in Las Vegas, gave the
Czech a lesson in staying power, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   He hit Novak with too much aggression and not enough of a
target. Novak pushed Agassi hard in the first set, trading breaks
and making him save two break points to cement a set-deciding
second. But Agassi always had an answer, a winner off the ground, a
slick drop shot. And in what was the most depressing development
for Novak, Agassi also had a brilliant day serving, 72 percent of
his first balls in, 12 for aces.
</P>
<P>
   For the one hour and 36 minutes that the match lasted, it was
too much for Novak to stand in and trade with this buzz saw dressed
in all black. ``I was getting tired and tired,'' he said, calling
Agassi a ``special player.''
</P>
<P>
   Last to argue with this point would be McEnroe, for whom Agassi
has won all four Cup matches without dropping a set or breaking a
sweat.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have to realize that this is the type of situation that
brings out the best in Andre,'' McEnroe said, reiterating the
obvious. ``The hell with those other tournaments. He's saving
himself for me and Davis Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not playing for John,'' Agassi said. ``I'm playing for my
country.''
</P>
<P>
   With McEnroe around as the human sound bite, it is sometimes
easy to forget that this not about the captain as much as it about
the competitors and their countries. But when it was over, when the
celebration commenced and the American flags came out, all seemed
forgiven and forgotten. McEnroe said he'd try to be more of a Zen
Master, like Phil Jackson, who sat serenely in the crowd. Sampras,
for his part, passed the glory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all the coaching,'' Sampras said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah,'' McEnroe said.

WORLD'S TOP GOLFERS FALL SHORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Tiger Woods bemoaned a trio of missed putts.
David Duval hung his head in disbelief after blocking a 5-iron
approach into the water at the 13th hole. Ernie Els gnashed his
teeth over an ill-timed camera click.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Vijay Singh slipped into a green jacket.
</P>
<P>
   On the way to becoming the first player from Fiji to win a
Masters championship, Singh brushed aside a pair of final-round
charges from the top two players in the world golf rankings
yesterday at Augusta National Golf Club. For good measure, Singh
also slammed the door on Els, who posted the lowest closing score
among the front-runners (68) and said he ``felt like I'd win from
the minute I stepped on the first tee'' yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the round, Singh had changed Els' tune. Playing
with Duval in the final group, Singh bagged five birdies during a
round of 69, including a 20-footer at No. 18, to win by three
strokes.
</P>
<P>
   But Singh also showed signs of vulnerability. He three-putted
two greens, dumped an approach shot into the water at No. 11 and
airmailed the 12th green before saving par. Those bobbles opened
opportunities for Woods, Duval and Els. Each fell off the pace in a
different manner.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, the world's top-ranked golfer, collected three birdies on
the front nine but lipped out putts for birdie at No. 10 (20 feet)
and No. 11 (15 feet) before misreading an 8-footer at No. 13 and
sliding it right of the hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I make those three, I'm right in the ballgame,'' said
Woods, who finished at 4-under after posting the best weekend
scores (68-69) at Augusta. ``The first two, it was hard to believe
they didn't go in. They just grazed the edge. I guess the golfing
gods just didn't look down on me in a good way this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval, who played the final 36 holes with Singh, saw his title
hopes disappear when he drowned a 5-iron approach from 196 yards at
No. 13. Duval was a stroke behind Singh at the time. The errant
shot resulted in a two-stroke swing at the par-5 hole. Duval never
recovered, finishing at 6-under after a closing bogey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got over the ball, the wind picked up, then it would die,''
said Duval, the No. 2 player in the world rankings. ``The same
thing kept happening. Then, I decided on the right line and hit a
poor golf shot. That was probably the only poor shot I hit all
weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Els, the No. 12 player in the world rankings, moved crisply up
the leader board with a back-nine 33. He left himself with putts
for birdie inside 15 feet on each of the final three holes. He
failed to make any of them. Els was most disappointed in a missed
12-footer at No. 18, which left him at 7-under with Singh watching
from the fairway while sitting on a 9-under total.
</P>
<P>
   Before rolling the putt, Els backed off at address after hearing
the click a photographer's camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guy got way ahead. I wasn't even taking the putter back
and he was off,'' Els said. ``If I made the putt, I might still
have lost. But I would at least have given Vijay a chance to think
about it. That \Rphotographer\S should never take a golf picture in
his life again.''
</P>
<P>
   After Els missed, Singh, the No. 8 player in the world rankings,
wrapped up the event with a closing birdie to reach 10 under.
Although distracted by the photographer at No. 18, Els said: ``I
had my chances. ... It wasn't meant to be for me. I'll try again
next year.''

LOW AMATEUR TIE NICKLAUS WITH 78
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ David Gossett, the reigning U.S. Amateur champ
from the University of Texas, accepted his silver medal yesterday
for being the low amateur at the Masters Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the most vivid memory Gossett, a sophomore, will
take back to Austin. Gossett played the final round paired with
Jack Nicklaus, the six-time Masters champ, and matched scores with
the Golden Bear. Both players shot 78 to finish at 15 over for the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing with Jack Nicklaus on Sunday at the Masters, it
doesn't get any better than this,'' said Gossett, 20. ``I just wish
it wasn't such an early tee time.''
</P>
<P>
   Gossett, the only amateur to survive the 36-hole cut, completed
his final round before the leaders teed off. He finished in a tie
for 54th place but said it was ``an honor'' to finish as the low
amateur in his Masters debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll take a lot of positives out of this week,'' Gossett
said. ``I'm not pleased with the way I played on the weekend
(79-78), but it's an honor to be the low amateur. I'm very proud of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he referred to his final-round playing partner,
Gossett said: ``I called him `Mr. Nicklaus.' He never told me to
call him, `Jack.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Although he has two years of eligibility remaining, Gossett said
he is leaning toward turning professional after playing as an
amateur in the British Open (July 20-23).
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't hurt my decision any,'' Gossett said of his
Masters finish. ``I'll take a good hard look at things after the
British Open. But I know I can play out here. I don't feel I'm very
far from being competitive.''  &QL; 
Nicklaus' last stand?
</P>
<P>
   Jack Nicklaus said yesterday it is ``possible'' he has taken his
final competitive walk up the 18th fairway at Augusta National Golf
Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying it was. I'm not saying it wasn't,'' said
Nicklaus, 60. ``I have no idea. I know I can play here. But it's
possible that was my last walk at No. 18.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus has uttered similar sentiments after past Masters
disappointments. But if this was the end, Nicklaus would bow out on
a down note. He shot a 78 in yesterday's final round. He completed
his final 32 holes of the tournament without posting a birdie. His
81 during the third round marked the highest score of Nicklaus' 156
career rounds at Augusta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have much enthusiasm, I'm afraid. I couldn't grind or
make anything happen,'' said Nicklaus, who talked boldly of
challenging for the title after posting an even-par total through
36 holes. Nicklaus finished at 15 over and tied for 54th, his worst
Masters finish since missing the cut in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 38 years when Nicklaus has completed four rounds at
Augusta, the 54th-place effort marks his worst finish on the leader
board.  &QL; 
Putting problems
</P>
<P>
   Tarrant County residents Mark Brooks and Brandt Jobe backtracked
during the final round of the Masters because of balky putters.
Both players shot closing rounds of 74. Both players posted their
highest putt totals of tournament week: 31 for Brooks, a Fort Worth
resident, and 33 for Jobe, a Southlake resident.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks finished at 7 over and tied for 40th. Jobe, who placed
14th at the 1999 Masters, faded to 48th with a 9-over total.  &QL; 
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Jack Nicklaus said he is unsure of his upcoming schedule, but he
might compete in the Houston Open (April 27-30) and the Compaq
Classic of New Orleans (May 4-7) with his son Gary. During the week
of the Houston event, Nicklaus is scheduled to accept the Dave Marr
Award, a lifetime achievement award presented by the Houston Golf
Association, as well as open a new course in The Woodlands.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Aaron, 63, on becoming the oldest Masters cut survivor:
``I may not make another cut, so I'll probably look back on this
with pretty nice terms despite what happened on the weekend.''
Aaron shot 86-81 during the weekend rounds, the high scores of the
cut survivors.

CLARK GETTING SKIPPED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL AND MAC ENGEL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Left-hander Kenny Rogers will start Thursday
against the Yankees in New York in a move designed to ``give us the
best chance overall to win the most ballgames,'' manager Johnny
Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Mark Clark, the Rangers' fifth starter, is not
scheduled to pitch until Saturday against the Indians in Cleveland.
Clark (1-0, 5.06 earned-run average) is 0-3 with a 9.28 ERA through
five career appearances spanning 211/3 innings against the Yankees
and won his only start against the Indians in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Oates' decision to start Rogers (1-1, 2.40) on his regular day
to pitch also means the Rangers will start two left-handers during
their three-game series against New York. Oates plans to start
left-hander Darren Oliver (0-0, 7.71) in tomorrow's opener. Yankee
Stadium favors left-handed pitchers with its spacious power alley
in left-center field. \Nsubheds:Delgado slowing down \Nagatea:This
weekend represented progress for the Rangers in their struggle
against Blue Jays first baseman Carlos Delgado.
</P>
<P>
   The left-handed power hitter wore the Rangers out last season by
hitting .447 (17-for-38) with seven home runs and 15 runs batted in
over 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   Delgado did not hit a home run during the three-game series, but
he went 3-for-11 with three doubles and drove in four runs.  &QL; 
Chilly reception
</P>
<P>
   Snow forced the postponement of yesterday's game between the
Dodgers and Mets at New York's Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   What can the Rangers look forward to this week at Yankee
Stadium?
</P>
<P>
   The forecast calls for rain tomorrow and Thursday and highs
ranging from 51-53 degrees and lows ranging from 39-46 degrees.  &QL; 
Rounding third
</P>
<P>
   In the second inning with Frank Catalanotto at first base, Luis
Alicea hit a double to right field, easily scoring Ruben Mateo. But
it wasn't deep enough to send Catalanotto home, so third base coach
Jerry Narron threw up the stop sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assumed I was going to score easily,'' Catalanotto said.
</P>
<P>
   Catalanotto ran through the sign, and, with the aide of the
relay throw that sailed up the third base line, Catalanotto did
score easily, giving the Rangers a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it \Rthe sign\S late, and it was too late,'' Catalanotto
said. ``I didn't keep my eye on it, and I have to keep my head up.
It's something I have to make sure I do, and it won't happen
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's a Detroit thing.
</P>
<P>
   On Opening Day against Chicago, Catalanotto's former Tigers
teammate, Gabe Kapler, avoided a stop sign and scored when he
bowled over White Sox's catcher Mark Johnson, dislodging the ball
to score the run.  &QL; 
Looking blue
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's game had a distinct blue look to it.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Rangers and Blue Jays wore blue uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not my fault we wore blue \RSaturday\S night,'' said
Rangers starting pitcher Rick Helling, who selected the team colors
yesterday. ``Kenny \RRogers\S made that call. I thought we were
supposed to wear blue at all day games, and \Ryesterday was\S a day
game.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a superstitious thing. He wore white in his first
start of the season, Tuesday against the White Sox.
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Oates gave catcher Ivan Rodriguez the afternoon off after
Saturday's night game. The move actually provides Rodriguez with
two days off with the Rangers not scheduled to play tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Ruben Mateo extended his hitting streak to
career-best six games with a 2-for-4 performance.
</P>
<P>
   Right fielder Gabe Kapler is 1-for-14 in his past four games.

   PURCHASE OF ROBERT FLEMING BY CHASE IS SEEN THIS WEEK
</P>
<P>
   Robert Fleming Holdings, one of Britain's last independent
banks, is expected to announce this week that it will be acquired
by Chase Manhattan for close to 5 billion pounds, or nearly $8
billion, executives close to the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   That price is higher than most analysts expected when reports of
the negotiations emerged last month.

   A PRIVATE SOLUTION FOR MICROSOFT?
</P>
<P>
   With a federal judge ruling last week that Microsoft repeatedly
violated the law, the government has the easy part of the antitrust
case behind it. The real policy challenge comes now: What are the
right remedies? One respected economist suggests that the
government could just walk away and leave remedies to private
litigation.

   TURNED ON TO THE NEW ECONOMY
</P>
<P>
   Despite their obvious differences, the Internet era and the
radical 1960s are linked in the psyches of many. For one thing, the
Internet is a radically youth-centric culture, convinced that dewy
college graduates can better see the future than those already
tainted by their role in the old economy. There is also an aura of
vitality and era-defining importance around the activities of those
who are plugged into the new economy.
</P>
<P>
   MALLS LOOK TO COMPETE ONLINE, TOO
</P>
<P>
   Web merchants have had a lot of fun at the expense of shopping
malls, contending that mall shopping was a waste of time and money.
Now, with investors fleeing Web merchants en masse, malls are
poised for a counteroffensive. They are vying to fill the gaps left
by traditional and online retailers in areas like ordering and
customer service. Efforts include Internet connections inside malls
for merchants and hand-held scanners that allow shoppers to select
items, either to put on a wish list or to buy.

<P>
   A TEST CASE FOR PRESS FREEDOM
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, advocates for freedom of the press hope that a case
involving the author of a best-selling crime book will set a
precedent for the kind of reporters' shield legislation that spread
in the United States in the 1970s. Stephen Williams' book,
``Invisible Darkness,'' contains precise details of a gory
sex-murder scene. Williams has been charged with two counts of
disobeying a judge's order to disclose the source of the details.

   `SOPRANOS' CONSOLIDATES ITS POWER
</P>
<P>
   The mob-family hit ``The Sopranos,'' burdened this season with
expectations heavier than cement shoes, finished its second burst
of 13 episodes Sunday night, having added to the biggest
programming phenomenon in HBO history. Ratings soared for ``The
Sopranos'' in its second season, climbing more than 60 percent.
Though the ratings are important, there is something broader at
stake. HBO does not measure the success of its series in direct
income. Because HBO is a subscription channel dependent on monthly
fees, the prime consideration is selling people on the channel in
an increasingly crowded marketplace.

   The tales of the children's book character Captain Underpants

AMBASSADOR REJECTS PROTRAYING CHINA AS ENEMY 
</HEADLINE>
   By CRAIG S. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI _ As China repeated threats against Taiwan, the
American ambassador to Beijing made remarks over the weekend that
encouraged prudence, saying that viewing China as an enemy could
become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
</P>
<P>
   The ambassador, Joseph Prueher, said in an interview here that
the United States had ``both the strength and the time'' to work
with China and to try to ensure that its government and economy
develop in ways that fit American interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important, not to get a mind-set that sees China
as an enemy,'' he said during a visit to Shanghai. ``We need to
hope and work for the best, while remaining prepared for the
worst.''
</P>
<P>
   The tensions over Taiwan have complicated Clinton administration
efforts to rally support for a bill before Congress that would
grant China permanent normal trade relations. China has demanded
that status as a condition for wide-ranging trade concessions it
has promised if it is allowed to join the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing's threats of war against Taiwan, if ever carried out,
would probably draw the United States into direct conflict with
China. Under the Taiwan Relations Act, the United States promises
to help ensure the security of the island, which has operated as an
independent state since the Nationalist army fled there after
losing the civil war on the mainland in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions across the Taiwan Strait have risen since the election
last month of Chen Shui-bian as Taiwan's new president. His
Democratic Progressive Party advocates declaring independence from
Beijing, which China warns would mean war. Chen has softened his
stance on the issue but has refused to accept Beijing's ``one China
policy'' that would subjugate Taiwan to Beijing's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   The bill on American trade relations with China, which will be
voted on next month, would remove an annual congressional review of
China's trade status that has been in place since the 1989 killings
of pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing. Many people in
Washington regard China as an emerging adversary that should be
dealt with harshly.
</P>
<P>
   But Prueher echoed Clinton's view that the United States could
help effect positive change in China by engaging the country.
Granting it permanent normal trade relations is part of that
process, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prueher is a retired admiral and was Pacific Fleet commander in
1996 when the United States sent two carrier groups to the seas
around Taiwan as a warning after China fired missiles into the
waters off the island. China had been trying to intimidate
Taiwanese voters during the country's first presidential elections
and was infuriated by the action.
</P>
<P>
   Prueher said that despite Beijing's threats he believed the
mainland would maintain its wait-and-see attitude. ``All sides
agree that we need to be very cautious, prudent and creative here
in the post-election period,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said there had been no indication that Beijing had made any
military moves to back up its threats. And while he said China's
leadership had made it clear that the Taiwan issue transcends trade
organization membership or other issues, it was ``not a military
problem'' and it did not ``yield to a military solution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Taiwan security _ for Taiwan not to get kicked around _ comes
from U.S. backing, not from any particular weapon system,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan has asked the United States to sell it more advanced
arms.
</P>
<P>
   Prueher said that with economic modernization a priority the
Chinese generals with whom he spoke remained frustrated by the slow
modernization of China's armed forces. But its accelerating
procurement of arms from Russia ``is not a troubling issue because
of degrees of scale, but it's a trend we'll have to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Relations between Russia and China have improved in recent
years, particularly since NATO's intervention in Kosovo, which both
countries opposed. And Russia has recently supplied China with
advanced weapons systems, including Sovremenny guided missile
destroyers designed to challenge American aircraft carrier groups.

MARTINEZ STOPS ANGELS 5-2
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- Angels manager Mike Scioscia said his club shouldn't
be intimidated by Red Sox pitcher Pedro Martinez. Angels starting
pitcher Kent Bottenfield said it didn't matter whom he was facing.
</P>
<P>
   Then they played the game.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez again showed he has no equal in the game today, taking
a shutout into the eighth inning before giving up a run in the Red
Sox's 5-2 victory Sunday afternoon before 35,847 at Edison Field.
Martinez's 12 strikeouts marked the 10th consecutive start he has
struck out at least 10, including both starts this season.
</P>
<P>
   He struck out every hitter in the Angels lineup at least once
except Adam Kennedy and Benji Gil, who had two hits. Troy Glaus
struck out all three times he faced Martinez, who walked only one.
</P>
<P>
   It was after the walk to Darin Erstad with one out in the eighth
that spelled the end for Martinez (2-0) after 112 pitches. Kennedy
singled home a run later in the inning off Derek Lowe, but the run
was charged to Martinez, ending his consecutive scoreless-innings
streak of 32 1/3 innings (including last postseason). It was the
first earned run allowed by Martinez in 35 1/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you keep it close against him, you have a shot,'' said
Angels first baseman Mo Vaughn, who grounded out twice and struck
out against Martinez. ``But if you give him a big lead, you can
cancel Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield (0-1) did keep it close early, even though he said
he had trouble locating his fastball. The game was scoreless in the
fourth inning when with two out, Bottenfield gave up back-to-back
homers on consecutive pitches to Troy O'Leary and Carl Everett. The
pitch to O'Leary came on a 0-2 count.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a matter of good hitters taking advantage of my
mistakes,'' Bottenfield (6 innings, 3 runs, 5 hits) said. ``I had a
situation where I could have gotten out of it, but I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez didn't make such mistakes, and he threw all three of
his pitches -- fastball, curveball, changeup -- exactly where he
wanted to. The velocity on his fastball wasn't as great as it
normally is -- he topped out at 96-mph, but was in the low 90's
most of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a normal outing,'' said Martinez, who has allowed one
run in his two starts (14 1/3 innings). ``My changeup is better and
my curveball is better. Everything seems to be coming along fine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was there (Boston) he didn't use the breaking pitch
like now,'' Vaughn said. ``He used it to set guys up. Now he uses
it to get guys out. It's hard to say he's gotten better, but he's
gotten better. It's scary.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Angels faced Martinez last season, they were
shut out the following day by the Indians. Angels manager Mike
Scioscia was asked if there was anything he could do to keep his
hitters from suffering from another ``Martinez hangover.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just make sure he's on the plane back to Boston or wherever
they're going,'' he said, ``and we'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had opportunities early against Martinez, putting a
runner in scoring position in three of the first four innings. But
Martinez got outs when he needed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did he dominate us? No, we had opportunities,'' Scioscia said.
``It's not like we didn't have chances to score off him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels added a run in the ninth inning against Lowe on Scott
Spiezio's team-leading second homer of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels can at least take solace in knowing they won't have
to face Martinez again until August, the next time they play the
Red Sox, and that Martinez is lined up in the rotation to face
their division foes Oakland and Texas later this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now he's the best pitcher in baseball,'' Vaughn said.
``He can tell you what's coming and you're not going to hit it. It
doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there is any way to prepare for facing Martinez, Vaughn
said: ``You don't. Go out and have a drink.''

RENO SEES QUICK RESOLUTION TO DISPUTE OVER ELIAN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The international showdown over the fate of
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez could be headed to a climax this week,
with Attorney General Janet Reno saying Sunday that she is ``very
firm'' about resolving the matter in a few days. The Miami
relatives caring for the boy said through their lawyer that they
would ``stand back'' if US officials sought to transfer Elian to
his father.
</P>
<P>
   But with negotiations being conducted both in private and on the
Sunday television talk shows, questions remained about when and
where the transfer would occur, whether it would it would be
peaceful, and whether a court appeal by the relatives might slow
down or stop the process. It also remained possible that Elian
might be transferred to his father within days, but that the pair
would not return to Cuba for weeks while court appeals are
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   One of the relatives caring for Elian, Marisleysis Gonzalez,
reportedly was hospitalized Saturday with stomach and
stress-related complaints. It was unclear where she was staying and
whether the illness was serious enough to stall the transfer. At
the request of Reno, the Miami relatives are slated to meet Monday
with psychologists and psychiatrists who are helping to prepare for
Elian's transfer.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder, while expecting a peaceful
transfer for Elian, said that the US government would ``do what is
necessary to reunite father and son.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno, appearing on ABC's ``This Week'' Sunday, expressed her
admiration for Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who told her
last week that he has no interest in defecting to the United
States. Reno said Gonzalez is willing to stay in the United States
for as long as it takes to resolve the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who is staying at the Maryland home of Cuban
diplomatic official Fernando Remirez, will stay here as long as
necessary ``if he could have the child turned over in a careful,
thoughtful way,'' Reno said. ``If you talked to his father, you
would feel like you were talking to Elian Gonzalez about 30 years
later. He cares so much'' for Elian, Reno added.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer Eig, a lawyer for the Miami relatives, said Sunday that
the family would allow immigration officials to take the boy, but
did not want to help facilitate the transfer. That left open the
question of whether the relatives would agree to go to a location
outside of Miami to transfer Elian to his father. US officials want
the transfer to occur outside Miami to avoid confronting the crowd
of protesters gathered outside the relatives' house.
</P>
<P>
   If US officials come to the house, Eig said, the relatives will
not resist the transfer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll unlock the door and stand back,'' Eig said. ``They'll
stand back, they'll cry, and their hearts will break.''
</P>
<P>
   Eig and another attorney for the relatives, Linda Osberg-Braun,
suggested that Juan Gonzalez was acting under duress from the Cuban
government.
</P>
<P>
   But Holder, the deputy attorney general, said on NBC's ``Meet
the Press'' that he saw no evidence of that when he met with
Gonzalez on Friday for an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not with any Cuban official, he was alone with his wife
and 6-month-old boy,'' Holder said. Holder said that he came
prepared to offer asylum to Gonzalez, but that the Cuban began the
meeting by saying he wanted to return to his homeland with Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Alarcon, president of the Cuban National Assembly, said
on several of Sunday's talk shows that Gonzalez was under no
pressure from the Cuban government. Alarcon said that if Gonzalez
wanted to defect, he could have done so at the Justice Department
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had wanted to remain in the US, ask for asylum or
whatever, he was in the right place, completely alone without any
Cuban official accompanying him,'' Alarcon said via satellite from
Cuba. ``Alone with his family and the authorities that are
entitled, according to US law, to grant him an asylum.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Miami relatives may have no choice other than to hand
over Elian to his father, they would at least like to prevent Elian
from being taken to Cuba. A federal court is slated to decide that
aspect of the case in May. In addition, the relatives are still
seeking custody of Elian in a Florida state family court.
</P>
<P>
   The boy came to the United States last Thanksgiving Day, when he
was found off the Florida coast by two fishermen. Gonzalez's mother
and nine others perished during the sea voyage on an aluminum
motorboat from Cuba; he managed to survive by clinging to an inner
tube.
</P>
<P>
   One of the fishermen, Donato Dalrymple, came to Washington
Sunday and met with Juan Miguel Gonzalez in an effort to persuade
him to remain in the United States with Elian. Dalrymple said after
the meeting that Gonzalez embraced him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was eternally grateful to me. He embraced me. And you could
tell it was not fabricated,'' Dalrymple said.
</P>
<P>
   While efforts to get Gonzalez to defect to the United States
apparently have failed, Elian's US relatives still hoped to
persuade Gonzalez to meet with them. But Gonzalez's attorney,
Gregory Craig, said that he had ruled out the possibility of a
Miami meeting.

MIAMI POINTS KNICKS INTO A DIFFERENT DIRECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ It was not a trump of the stardusted shot the Knicks'
Allan Houston made here last May to eliminate the Heat in the first
round, but Tim Hardaway came up with a little magic in his
fingertips Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   With 4.7 seconds left in overtime, and the Heat down by 2
points, Hardaway drove hard to his left with Chris Childs riding
his hip the whole way. Hardaway stopped behind the 3-point arc and
then flung up a one-handed hook over the leaping Childs. With the
ball in midair, the crowd rose. It was good as it plunged down the
throat of the net at the buzzer to give the Heat a critical 95-94
victory at American Airlines Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The loss for the Knicks was devastating to their plans of
stealing the No. 2 seeding in the Eastern Conference from the Heat.
Instead of cutting the Heat's lead in the East to one game, the
Knicks fell three games behind them with six games left in the
regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Alonzo Mourning led the Heat with 33 points and took care of
Patrick Ewing (13 points, 14 rebounds). The Knicks were led by
Houston's 23 points and Latrell Sprewell's 19.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Knicks had their spirits sapped by the Heat. So
often, it has been the other way around for the Heat, which has had
its psyche tramped by Knick miracles. For a while it looked like
another disappointment for Miami.
</P>
<P>
   When the Knicks looked doomed, they responded to force the
overtime. With 1 minute 11 seconds left in regulation, Dan Majerle
was left open by Houston for a 3-pointer to give the Heat a 88-85
lead. Things looked bleak for the Knicks. Ewing missed a jumper,
but then the Knicks' defense shut down the Heat and forced a
24-second violation.
</P>
<P>
   Then in a whirlwind of tipped balls and misses, somehow the
Knicks tied the score. On the desperate possession, Houston missed
a 3-pointer, then Sprewell missed one, too. All the while, Ewing
kept each miss alive with tips. One ricochet went to Houston, who
zinged a pass to Childs, who put down a 3-pointer to tie the score
with 11.9 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks had a chance to put the game away earlier. But
Mourning scored 6 points during a 13-5 run that enabled the Heat to
take the lead, 85-83, with 1:44 left in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   For three games, the combination of Sprewell and Houston had
been fizzling quietly in the background of Ewing's domination. They
had been unable to combine for more than 20 points as a result of
their inability to adjust to the pressure and their opponents'
double teams and traps.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been struggling offensively,'' Coach Jeff Van Gundy
said before Sunday night's game. ``We've won the last two. But I
don't think you can do that consistently.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, both players were more assertive. They had to be.
Ewing exited the game with 7:22 left in the first quarter after his
second foul. Before he sat down, he baited the fans by flapping his
arm.
</P>
<P>
   Houston and Sprewell responded to Ewing's absence. Although the
aggressive Majerle and the long-armed Bruce Bowen played him
physically, Houston had an edge about him as he drove, stopped and
pulled up for fadeaway jumpers. Although Sprewell was playing
against the bulk of Jamal Mashburn and Clarence Weatherspoon, he
used his quickness to get around them and also beat both down the
court in transition.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Ewing returned, the Knicks kept pushing the ball. At
times, they ignored Ewing's pleas for the ball in the paint. By the
end of the first half, Sprewell and Houston had combined for 21
points and had the Knicks ahead, 49-46. Playing just 14 minutes
because of foul trouble, Ewing shot just four times and had 4
points. His counterpart, Mourning, was doing the heavy lifting for
the Heat.
</P>
<P>
   Wheeling inside of Ewing, as well as fading away for jumpers,
Mourning scored 15 points, while Hardaway added 9 points. They kept
the Heat in the game despite a poor performance by Mashburn, who
was 0 for 8 around the aggressive defense of Sprewell in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell continued to make an impact in the third quarter.
Making life miserable for Mashburn, he drove by him for a dunk and
then faded back for a jumper to give the Knicks a 58-53 lead with
7:13 left. Coach Pat Riley had seen enough. He took out a
frustrated Mashburn and put in Bowen.
</P>
<P>
   That made all the difference. In the span of three minutes,
Bowen stayed glued to Sprewell and then bolted free of him for a
3-pointer. Bowen also found Mourning on a bullet pass that led to a
dunk. With Bowen in the game, the Heat went on a 9-4 run to tie the
score with 3:14 remaining in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks did not shake at all. Instead, they took off on a
10-0 run. Taking advantage of some loose defense by the Heat,
Houston popped a 3-pointer and then hit a free throw when Hardaway
was hit with a technical foul. After getting tied up with Ewing,
Hardaway yelled at the official Dan Crawford and paid for it. With
1:06 left in the third quarter, the Knicks led 72-62, and held onto
a 72-64 lead as they entered the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear that the Knicks did not let their two days of
sunshine distract them from their purpose early in the game. They
came out focused and sharp, shooting a mind-boggling 70 percent in
the first quarter. The Knicks led by as many as 11 points before
the Heat regrouped, buckled down on defense and worked the ball
inside to Mourning to cut the Knicks' first-quarter lead to 28-21.
</P>
<P>
   Then a few defensive lapses cost the Knicks. During a 10-4 run
by the Heat, Houston, whose defense doesn't always coincide with
his hot offense, lost Bowen for a 3-pointer and a driving layup.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks, who missed six of their first seven shots in the
second quarter, found themselves behind, 33-32, with 8:30 left in
the half. But Sprewell and Houston found their groove again and led
the Knicks on a 15-5 run to take back control of the game before
the half. &QL;

MOXIE KEPT HELLING DOWNSTAIRS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON _ In baseball parlance, Rangers pitcher Rick Helling
likes to work upstairs.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs, unfortunately, happens to be in the same neighborhood
as downtown. And downtown, 68 times over the past two seasons, has
been the final destination of some of Helling's proudest fastballs.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's road map to impending trouble, therefore, was plain
to see _ namely, fly-ball pitcher plus weeklong gusty winds equals
lots of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   But there was Helling yesterday, still battling the Toronto Blue
Jays in the sixth inning, shuffling pitches, writhing to find the
strike zone and, in the end, leaving the Rangers in position to
grab a 7-5 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``After three innings and 75 pitches, it didn't look like he
would go far,'' manager Johnny Oates correctly observed. ``But that
just shows you what a competitor he is. He just kept battling and
battling and gave us a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates' math was correct. Helling threw 29 pitches in the first
inning yesterday, when the Jays' Carlos Delgado laced a two-run
double, and by the end of the third inning Helling's pitch count
had bulged to 75.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd fidgeted. The manager, surprisingly, didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it has been a three-year soap opera, this unspoken
scrimmage between Helling's pride and Oates' patience. You've
watched it unfold _ Oates walking to the mound, quick hook in hand,
while visible steam seems to spew from Helling's ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day I'm happy when he comes to the mound to take me out is
the day I'll quit,'' Helling assured yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the first 13 Blue Jays that Helling faced yesterday
reached base. Through the first four innings, Helling had recorded
only one ground-ball out.
</P>
<P>
   ``His command wasn't there,'' Toronto manager Jim Fregosi said.
``We swung at a lot of bad balls. We had a ton of opportunities,
but we just didn't get it done. He was effectively wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever he walked, he should have walked more.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. But Luis Alicea's two-run double had staked the Rangers a
3-2 advantage, and Helling, like a dog with a yard bone, had
refused to give it up.
</P>
<P>
   And Oates, for his part, could see that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You buy rope,'' Oates explained. ``But I didn't just give him
the rope. My feeling is that he's earned that rope.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two seasons, Helling started 68 times for the
Rangers. Yes, he has been taken downtown an equal number of times.
But he has also won 33 of his 51 decisions over those two seasons.
And with runners in scoring position, Helling allowed opponents to
bat only .224, the sixth-lowest average allowed in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see Rick as being able to throw a lot of pitches,'' Oates
said, ``and being able to work himself into trouble but out of
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly. Helling faced seven Toronto hitters yesterday when
runners were in scoring position; the Blue Jays were 0-for-7.
</P>
<P>
   He did it this time while toying with something new, a sinker
pitch. In the past, Helling mostly has been a fastball-curveball
pitcher, with something of a changeup mixed in. This season he is
trying to add the sinker and a slider.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw everything today,'' Helling said. ``I even threw some
first-pitch sliders to right-handed batters that were taken for
strikes, and they kind of looked back, as if to say, `What was
that?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Old bulldogs, even 29-year-old ones, are not supposed to be able
to learn new tricks. But if Helling, the quintessential fly-ball
pitcher, can effectively add a pitch that allows him to work the
lower extremities of the strike zone, he would be nasty.
</P>
<P>
   Oates and the Rangers dearly needed him yesterday, after a week
when the Ballpark winds mostly howled and 22 home runs escaped the
premises.
</P>
<P>
   But as the manager said, Helling earned the slack. The four hits
that he allowed were the fewest by Helling since June. By battling
through six innings, Helling also allowed Oates the luxury of not
having to go to the bullpen one inning too soon.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers head for their first road trip of the season still a
mystery. It was a week of both encouraging news and erratic news,
of winds and losses.
</P>
<P>
   It ended yesterday with the Blue Jays never quite making it
``downtown.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Helling has no problems with the change in neighborhood.

GOOD NEWS FOR DiSARCINA 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- Shortstop Gary DiSarcina hasn't had much luck with
his thumbs during his major league career, but Sunday he got a
break when he learned he had no break.
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina bruised his left thumb when trying to field a smash
hit by the Red Sox's Nomar Garciaparra in the second inning on
Saturday night. DiSarcina dived to his left to try to field the
one-hopper, but it deflected off the thumb on his glove hand and
into center field. DiSarcina stayed in the game until being
replaced by Benji Gil to start the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina had X-rays taken Sunday morning, which were negative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to rush it,'' said DiSarcina, who is day-to-day.
``As soon as I can get my hand in my glove, we'll take it from
there. I woke up (Sunday) and expected the worst. I couldn't move
it. When the X-rays showed nothing, it was a sigh of relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he played six more innings after sustaining the
injury, DiSarcina said: ``Because I'm stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina's bad luck with his thumbs goes back to 1993 when he
broke the knuckle of his right thumb when hit by a pitch. Then in
1995, DiSarcina tore a ligament in his left thumb sliding into
second trying to break up a double play. He missed six weeks with
each injury.
</P>
<P>
   After starting four of the first five games at DH, Scott Spiezio
got his first start in the field Sunday at first base, moving Mo
Vaughn to DH. Signed as a free agent from the A's, Spiezio was
competing for the starting spot at second base and was the
frontrunner until the Angels acquired Adam Kennedy in a trade with
the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   That left Spiezio without a position, but he has become the
primary DH. It's a new role for him, but he says he's adjusting
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great thing about this park is you've got the (batting)
cage right there next to the dugout if you want to hit,'' he said.
``And there's an (exercise) bike to keep loose, or you can look at
video. You couldn't do that in Oakland, you'd have to run upstairs.
Now everything's right by the dugout.''
</P>
<P>
   He's only 27, so he doesn't see himself as a DH. But Spiezio
said he can be happy there for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as I'm hitting, I don't care,'' he said. ``You could
put me behind the plate if you wanted to. The reason I came here
was for the at-bats.''
</P>
<P>
   Spiezio homered both Saturday and Sunday and leads the team with
two.
</P>
<P>
   Angels starters Jason Dickson, Ken Hill and Kent Bottenfield
have combined to throw three consecutive quality starts (at least 6
innings, 3 earned runs or less). ... Winning two of the three games
against the Red Sox, the Angels surpassed last season's win total
-- one -- vs. Boston. ... Catchers Bengie Molina and Matt Walbeck
have combined to throw out 67 percent (4 of 6) of would-be
basestealers.
</P>
<P>
   ANGELS VS. TORONTO
</P>
<P>
   Time: 7:05 at Edison Field
</P>
<P>
   TV/Radio: No TV; KMPC-1540, XPRS-1090
</P>
<P>
   Matchup: Scott Schoeneweis (1-0, 7.50 ERA) will make his second
start of the season for Anaheim against Toronto's Chris Carpenter
(0-1, 4.05). Schoeneweis beat the Yankees in his first start,
thanks to the offense's 12-run outburst. Left fielder Darin Erstad
has hit safely in all six games, and is hitting .556 (15 for 27)
with a team-leading seven RBI. The Angels lost nine of 12 games
against Toronto last season.

amazing feat of engineering (no slide rules, pocket protectors or
the Internet back in those days). Of course, it goes a little over
the top in quoting Napoleon, in the original French, remarking on

piece of fluff, but the pictures are cool, stretching from Newman's
high school yearbook photo to studio shots of him in Cool Hand
Luke, The Sting, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and The Color
of Money, for which he won an Oscar. The story starts out talking
about how amusing Newman is, but none of the jokes he tells are
very funny. But he does, the author slyly notes, still have those
same blue eyes. Let's hope so. In the way of actual history, there
is a decent piece on John D. Rockefeller, founder of Standard Oil,
the mammoth monopoly that was broken up by a trust-busting Teddy
Roosevelt and turned into most of the gas stations you see on
corners today. The story also notes that Rockefeller turned
philanthropist in his later years, giving millions to education,
health care, churches and orphanages. Bully. In the Masters of the

Cameron Diaz is quite fetching. Bully, bully. &QL;

   Lead story examines the hullabaloo around the Microwave
Anisotropy Probe (MAP for short), a NASA project that will catalog
microwave photons to answer the largest questions of the universe:
how old it is, how it will end, whether space is really infinite
and where exactly did I leave my car keys? The mission is a
follow-up to the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) that found the
faint afterglow of the Big Bang. If it survives its testing, and
launch, MAP will use its sophisticated equipment to recreate ``the
universe's baby picture.'' Another article notes that chimpanzees
speak in dialects, invent odd grooming styles and drum better than
most kids in marching bands, meaning they are closer to humans than
previously thought. And their TV shows are better than prime time,
too. In the category of Tediously Pointless Pursuits, a group of

device on top, to finally, once and for all, get its exact
elevation. And they got it. Plus or minus 7 feet. Doh!  &QL;

<P>
   Cover story checks in on the Red Hot Chili Peppers, noting that
Flea and the boys are back on their game with the release of
``Californication,'' which the mag calls ``their finest sustained
work ever.'' Piece holds that the Chili Peppers have evolved from
half-naked out-of-control young turks to half-naked elder
statesmen, after 17 years and seven albums. Article's funniest line
points out that the Chili Peppers ``have had so many guitarists _
seven _ they could hold a reunion barbecue for them every summer.''
There is also a well-written piece on Levon Helm, drummer for The
Band (``The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,'' ``Up On Cripple
Creek''), who is recovering from throat cancer and revisiting the
Delta blues and daughter Amy. In a Q&AMP;A, Latino heartthrob Marc

<P>
   Trying to drag your kids away from those dreaded Pok mon cards?
Want to trick them into learning something? Then Dig, a bi-monthly
published by the Archaeological Institute of America, is for you.
It's archaeology for kids, chock full of interesting articles,
games, puzzles and cartoons, all based on ancient cultures and
discovery. Written in a straightforward, accessible style, the
magazine actually tries to make learning fun. Don't let the board
of education hear about this. Lead story, about the great pyramids
of Egypt, does a fine job explaining why the pyramids are such an
amazing feat of engineering (no slide rules, pocket protectors or
the Internet back in those days). Of course, it goes a little over
the top in quoting Napoleon, in the original French, remarking on
the pyramids. There is another good piece on how archaeologists
date artifacts, explaining how different items are found on
different levels of a dig, and how carbon-14 dating is used.
Another interesting piece trie s to determine whether Hercules
really lived, or is just a creation of Greek mythology and Michael
Eisner. Can you dig it?  &QL;

   This week's cover story profiles Paul Newman, salad dressing
entrepreneur and part-time actor. Naturally, the story is a fawning
piece of fluff, but the pictures are cool, stretching from Newman's
high school yearbook photo to studio shots of him in Cool Hand
Luke, The Sting, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and The Color
of Money, for which he won an Oscar. The story starts out talking
about how amusing Newman is, but none of the jokes he tells are
very funny. But he does, the author slyly notes, still have those
same blue eyes. Let's hope so. In the way of actual history, there
is a decent piece on John D. Rockefeller, founder of Standard Oil,
the mammoth monopoly that was broken up by a trust-busting Teddy
Roosevelt and turned into most of the gas stations you see on
corners today. The story also notes that Rockefeller turned
philanthropist in his later years, giving millions to education,
health care, churches and orphanages. Bully. In the Masters of the
Stunningly Obvious section, there's a story noting that movie star
Cameron Diaz is quite fetching. Bully, bully. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``DISCOVER'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lead story examines the hullabaloo around the Microwave
Anisotropy Probe (MAP for short), a NASA project that will catalog
microwave photons to answer the largest questions of the universe:
how old it is, how it will end, whether space is really infinite
and where exactly did I leave my car keys? The mission is a
follow-up to the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) that found the
faint afterglow of the Big Bang. If it survives its testing, and
launch, MAP will use its sophisticated equipment to recreate ``the
universe's baby picture.'' Another article notes that chimpanzees
speak in dialects, invent odd grooming styles and drum better than
most kids in marching bands, meaning they are closer to humans than
previously thought. And their TV shows are better than prime time,
too. In the category of Tediously Pointless Pursuits, a group of
climbers clambered up Mount Everest to stick a global positioning
device on top, to finally, once and for all, get its exact
elevation. And they got it. Plus or minus 7 feet. Doh!  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``ROLLING STONE'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cover story checks in on the Red Hot Chili Peppers, noting that
Flea and the boys are back on their game with the release of
``Californication,'' which the mag calls ``their finest sustained
work ever.'' Piece holds that the Chili Peppers have evolved from
half-naked out-of-control young turks to half-naked elder
statesmen, after 17 years and seven albums. Article's funniest line
points out that the Chili Peppers ``have had so many guitarists _
seven _ they could hold a reunion barbecue for them every summer.''
There is also a well-written piece on Levon Helm, drummer for The
Band (``The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,'' ``Up On Cripple
Creek''), who is recovering from throat cancer and revisiting the
Delta blues and daughter Amy. In a Q&AMP;A, Latino heartthrob Marc
Anthony admits that he used to get sick to his stomach at the idea
of performing. Now he's engaged to a former Miss Universe. Go
figure. &QL;

TWO KOREAS AGREE TO FIRST MEETING AT SUMMIT LEVEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: The following now becomes the lead story on the NYT front
page. Longer version to follow.) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ In a major diplomatic effort to heal one of
the Cold War's last conflicts, the South Korean government
announced Monday that North Korea had agreed to a June summit
meeting between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the meeting, which would be the first between
heads of state of the two countries, would involve discussions of a
wide range of issues separating the two Koreas, which have been
left divided by a civil war since the 1950s. At a hastily called
news conference here Monday morning, officials said the issues to
be discussed at the summit meeting from June 12 to 14 in Pyongyang,
the North Korean capital, would include economic cooperation,
reunification of separated families and political reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that North Korea decided that there could be no
entry into the international community without some kind of
reconciliation between the two Koreas,'' said Park Jie Won,
minister of culture and tourism. ``President Kim's Berlin
declaration appears to have created the momentum for such a
meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a reference to President Kim Dae Jung's statement last
month in the German capital that the leaders of the two Koreas
should meet. Plans for a 1994 summit meeting had to be scrapped
when the North Korean leader, Kim Il Sung, died in July that year.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate confirmation from North Korea of the
summit plans, but officials here said that Pyongyang was expected
to issue a statement in the coming hours.
</P>
<P>
   The news is not only a major turnabout in the glacial state of
mutual nonrecognition between the two countries, whose armies still
face off across the 38th parallel.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a huge political development in South Korea on the
eve of Thursday's critical mid-term legislative elections, which
are seen as a referendum on Kim's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the opposition Grand National Party has
ridiculed Kim's attempts at reconciliation with the North, which
have included official encouragement of investments by South Korean
corporations in the North to help revive that country's near
bankrupt economy.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders have accused Kim of being overly generous
with his so-called Sunshine Policy, which has provided food and
agricultural aid to the Communist North, but has also encouraged
Washington and Tokyo to engage more with North Korea.

WHITE HOUSE ATTACKS DRUG COMPANIES FOR PRICE POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House attacked the pricing policies of
the drug industry on Sunday, saying drug companies charged higher
prices to uninsured customers than to people with insurance, and
President Clinton announced plans to hold a conference this summer
to investigate how pharmaceutical companies set their prices.
</P>
<P>
   The actions came as Clinton tried to fire up public support for
Medicare coverage of prescription drugs, one of his top goals in
his last year in office.
</P>
<P>
   A new study, to be unveiled by Clinton on Monday, found that
elderly people without insurance for drug costs typically pay 15
percent more than people with insurance for the same medicines.
Moreover, it said, this gap has more than doubled in the last four
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Individuals without drug coverage pay a higher price at the
retail pharmacy than the total price paid on behalf of those with
drug coverage,'' said the report, which Clinton requested last
October. ``Seniors without drug coverage not only lack insurance
against high costs, but do not have access to the discounts and
rebates that insured people receive.''
</P>
<P>
   Medicare, the federal health insurance program for 39 million
people who are elderly or disabled, generally does not cover
prescription drugs for people outside the hospital. Many
beneficiaries have some type of supplemental insurance to help pay
drug costs, but the White House said such coverage was shrinking
and was unreliable.
</P>
<P>
   In its new study, the White House said that Medicare
beneficiaries without drug insurance spent twice as much of their
own money on prescriptions, but bought one-third fewer drugs than
people with coverage. Health maintenance organizations and other
large health insurance plans can obtain discounts for their members
that are not generally available to individuals paying cash for
prescription drugs, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the drug industry said they agreed with the
government's finding that insurance could help consumers get
discounts on prescription drugs. And that, they said, was why they
wanted the government to subsidize private insurance to cover such
costs for Medicare beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expanded drug coverage is the answer,'' said Alan F. Holmer,
president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of
America, the trade group. ``But the president's plan is the wrong
solution. Seniors need to be able to choose the private insurance
plan that's best for them, not a big government one-size-fits-all
scheme.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said drug prices were determined by a complex
process that involved discounts, rebates and other financial
arrangements among drug manufacturers, wholesalers, pharmacists and
insurers.
</P>
<P>
   The drug industry regards the details of those arrangements as
proprietary information. But the White House said the conference on
``prescription-drug pricing practices'' would investigate such
rebates and discounts.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Jennings, the White House health policy coordinator, said
the administration and Congress needed information about drug
discounts and rebates to help them design prescription-drug
benefits for Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a basic need for policy-makers to understand how this
works,'' Jennings said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medicare should use the best techniques of the private sector
and should extract similar discounts from the pharmaceutical
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's efforts to obtain such data are
sure to cause apprehension among drug companies, which already fear
that the White House wants to regulate drug prices, despite its
statements to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said, ``Our analysis tends to understate the
ultimate price differences for insured and uninsured customers,''
because the government could not get data on rebates. Drug makers
pay such rebates to benefit management companies that enhance their
``market share'' by including their products on a list of
recommended drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In the last month, the House and the Senate have endorsed budget
blueprints that would provide up to $40 billion over five years for
Medicare drug benefits. But President Clinton has not begun serious
negotiations with Congress on how to design such a benefit.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   These are some of the obvious questions: How much should the
beneficiary pay in premiums, deductibles and co-payments? How much
of each prescription should the government pay? Should Medicare
provide special protection to people needing very expensive drugs?
Should the government subsidize drug benefits even for high-income
people?
</P>
<P>
   The new report, ``Prescription Drug Coverage, Spending,
Utilization and Prices,'' makes these points:
</P>
<P>
   _ Spending for prescription drugs is growing more than twice as
fast as other health spending. From 1993 to 1998, drug spending
increased an average of 12 percent a year, compared with an
increase of about 5 percent a year for all other types of health
spending.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ten percent of Medicare beneficiaries without drug coverage
reported that they needed a prescription medicine in the last year
but did not get it, because they could not afford it. Only 2
percent of beneficiaries with drug coverage reported having had
such an experience.
</P>
<P>
   _ About one-third of Medicare beneficiaries have no insurance to
help them buy prescription drugs. Forty-seven percent of
beneficiaries are uninsured for at least one month of the year; 53
percent have drug coverage for the entire year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nearly one-fourth of Medicare beneficiaries with incomes
exceeding four times the poverty level _ more than $45,000 a year
for a couple _ have no insurance coverage for prescription drugs.
``This contradicts the belief that lack of coverage is a problem
only for those with low incomes.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the White House said, the oldest Medicare
beneficiaries are most likely to lack drug coverage. About 37
percent of beneficiaries 85 and older lack coverage, compared with
28 percent of beneficiaries age 65 to 69.

DERIDING RIVAL'S CRITICISM, GIULIANI CAMPAIGNS WITH MCCAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC LIPTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, joined Sunday for the second
time in a week by Sen. John McCain, ridiculed a suggestion by the
Clinton campaign that he and the senator are linked to the
Republican Party's far right wing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to show everybody that I want to associate with the
senator,'' Giuliani said during a brief appearance at a midtown
Manhattan delicatessen with McCain, the former presidential
candidate from Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's comments were a reaction to a remark about McCain
made last week by Ellis Verdi, media consultant to Hillary Rodham
Clinton's Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am surprised that Mayor Giuliani would associate himself
with someone who is that far to the right,'' Verdi was quoted in
The New York Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who made a campaign swing with the mayor through Long
Island on Tuesday, made repeated references to the remark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I noticed that, since my last visit here, I am now part of the
`vast right-wing conspiracy,''' he said, referring to a term once
used by Clinton to describe certain critics of her and President
Clinton. ``I am very proud to be part of that organization.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, McCain joked, while he and the mayor sat down for a cup
of coffee at Ben's Kosher Deli on West 38th Street, ``we seized
this opportunity to hatch several plots.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said Verdi's comment inspired him to spend more time
with the senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I read that I wasn't supposed to associate with John
McCain,'' Giuliani said, ``I wanted to show that I was not going to
be deterred by comments from the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain holds more conservative views than the mayor on a number
of issues, such as abortion rights. But during his recent
unsuccessful bid for president, he was popular with moderate
Republicans in part because of his criticism of the role leaders of
conservative religious groups play in the party.
</P>
<P>
   It is those same moderate voters that Giuliani, who polls
suggest has slipped behind Clinton in the Senate race, wants to
attract. And McCain tried Sunday to help that effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason why I am so committed to getting Rudy Giuliani in
the United States Senate is he will be a voice of independence,''
McCain said. ``He will be a voice that speaks for those who many
times in the halls of the United States Senate are not spoken
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Dunn, a spokeswoman for the Clinton campaign, said
Giuliani should spend more time talking about issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain is not running for the Senate; Rudy Giuliani is,''
Dunn said. ``And at some point, the mayor is going to have to tell
the people of New York where he stands on the issues.''

SINGH HOLDS OFF ALL CHALLENGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ If it's something colorful you want, Fiji is
pleased to offer the kaleidoscopic kula bird. Another one of the
South Pacific archipelago's treasures, Vijay Singh, is a decidedly
different bird.
</P>
<P>
   He's as monochromatic as men come.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, at dusk on Sunday Singh stood behind the 18th green at
Augusta National Golf Club, looking a lot like the green-winged
parrot that's indigenous to his native land. His limbs were covered
by the green wool fabric of his 46L Masters jacket, Singh's prize
for finishing atop a leaderboard so illustrious it could have been
lifted straight from the world golf rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Singh fired a 3-under-par 69 from the hardest possible spot -
the top of the leaderboard - to hold off his good friend, Ernie
Els, who closed with a 68. David Duval, who started the day three
shots behind Singh, carded a 70 to finish in a tie for third with
Loren Roberts (69).
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods made another of his patented charges but fell a few
putts short, chasing his third-round 68 with a 69 to wind up fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wearing this green jacket tops it all,'' Singh said. ``I can't
describe the feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Stranded on the course Saturday when darkness descended, the
one-time teaching pro came out Sunday morning and parred his last
four holes to carry a three-stroke lead into the final round.
</P>
<P>
   Many golfers before him have found the final-round lead an
onerous burden but the world-weary 37-year-old never seemed to
sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Singh remained composed even when one of his golf balls splashed
down in the pond to the left of the 11th green and another ball
flirted with an azalea bush protecting a green-side bunker on the
12th green, while all the while Duval was breathing down his back.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of a felicitous drop at 11, Singh scrambled to
save par. On the next hole he got another lucky break when the
azalea bush spit his ball out in the bunker and he was able to get
up and down from there to maintain his one-stroke cushion over
Duval.
</P>
<P>
   To that point the final pairing of Singh and Duval was unfolding
like a match-play final. Duval, bidding for his first victory in a
major, drew to within two shots of Singh with a birdie on the par-5
second hole, gained another stroke on his playing partner when
Singh bogeyed the par-4 third, and then matched him birdie for
birdie on the sixth, eighth and ninth holes.
</P>
<P>
   On the 13th hole, an ill wind rose to greet Duval as he stood on
the fairway preparing to hit his second shot to the par-5 green.
Duval stepped away when he felt the gust, re-considered his club
choice, waited for the wind to die down and then, using a 5-iron,
hit the ball into Rae's Creek.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hit a bad golf shot. It was the only poor shot I hit
(in the final two rounds),'' said Duval, who bogeyed the hole while
Singh was blithely birdieing it. With the two-shot swing, it proved
to be the swing hole of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Els, playing in the group ahead of Singh and Duval, shaved three
strokes off par on his back nine to keep some heat on Singh, his
regular practice-round partner.
</P>
<P>
   He found himself within two strokes of the lead after Singh
three-putted for a bogey on the par-3 16th. But Els couldn't
convert 12-foot birdie putts on each of the final two holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't meant to be for me this year,'' said Els, who echoed
a common refrain in the clubhouse when he said he was glad Singh's
time had finally arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The Fijian works harder on his game than most any golfer on the
Tour, which endears him to his fellow pros who appreciate success
well-earned. Singh's skills go less appreciated outside the closed
ranks of the golfing community, as he's too busy working on his
game to promote himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's absolutely no doubt in my mind Vijay's one of the top
five players in the world right now,'' said Nick Price, who tied
for 11th. ``He has been for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   If the public was largely unaware of it until Sunday, that's
because ``Vijay's a very quiet, introverted man,'' Price said. ``If
anything, he shies away from the limelight.''
</P>
<P>
   For Singh, shirking attention just got a whole lot harder.

that causes AIDS. The disease has devastated the skating world in
the last decade, most notably taking the life of John Curry, the
1976 Olympic champion. Galindo, decided to speak about HIV because
the truth has always been liberating for him, especially in a sport
where rumor and gossip often take on the force of fact. ``Being
openly gay, having the cards laid on the table, made everything
easier for me in skating and making my choices in whatever road I

   (NYT8) BOWLING GREEN, Fla. -- April 9, 2000 --
RAMPAGE-KILLERS-II -- Jeffrey Wade Wallace, 38, incarcerated in the
Hardee Correctional Institution in Bowling Green, Fla. Wallace,
like other rampage killers, was convinced he was defending himself
against an intricate conspiracy. To this day, Wallace, insists that

HAND-HELD SYSTEMS TEMPT NEWS-HUNGRY CITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (With NEWS-DELIVERY-MEDIA) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ This is a city ravenous for news and mobile
communications, with more than a half-dozen national newspapers and
nearly half the population owning cellular phones. So the prospect
of devices that can deliver news to the palm of one's hand is
making the English downright giddy.
</P>
<P>
   Already there is so much pent-up demand for the new generation
of cellular phones offering Internet access based on the Wireless
Access Protocol, or WAP, that Vodafone AirTouch PLC, the world's
largest mobile-phone operator, has a waiting list for the phones
that may take months to fulfill.
</P>
<P>
   Europe has long been the leader of the cellular-telephone
revolution. In some countries, over 60 percent of the population
have wireless phones, compared with only about 25 percent in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when it comes to Internet access at home, Europe has been
the laggard. And while hand-held devices like the Palm Pilot have
taken off in the United States, Europeans have been slower to adopt
them.
</P>
<P>
   But mobile Internet access is a completely new game on both
sides of the Atlantic. U.S. cellular operators are offering an
array of mobile Internet options, though the offerings are based on
a hodgepodge of technologies. But in Europe, where all mobile
phones are based on a continent-wide standard called GSM, mobile
Internet access is limited so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of services have rolled out really quickly in the
U.S.,'' said Noah Yasskin, an analyst for the research firm of
Jupiter Communications in London. ``In Europe, everyone's waiting
for the phones and the standards. When it does roll out, it will be
really big because of the unified standards and the number of
people who use mobile phones.''
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers and other information providers are rushing to format
their content for mobile phones and to negotiate deals for
placement on the phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a lot of negotiations for WAP content,'' said Mike
Caldwell, a spokesman for Vodafone, who himself owns a WAP-enabled
mobile phone with links to the BBC and The Independent newspaper.
``We believe WAP is going to be big by next Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested a technical transition was responsible for the slow
rollout of interactive services on mobile telephones. Caldwell
compared the situation to Europe's changeover from analog cellular
service to the digital GSM format in December 1991. ``You couldn't
get a phone until a year later,'' he said. ``People said GSM stood
for God Send Mobiles.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the current delays can be traced to a bug in some of the
early Nokia WAP phones that Vodafone ordered. ``There was a glitch
in the first batch,'' he said. ``So we returned them.''
</P>
<P>
   Wireless Access Protocol will give users access to Internet
sites specially formatted for the small screens of mobile phones.
Headlines, sports scores and listings are being developed for the
phones.
</P>
<P>
   Yasskin, the Jupiter analyst, predicted that WAP phones would
supplement, rather than replace, other types of Internet access.
``The mobile screen is so small that you are not talking about a
rich media experience,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   An information delivery system that has already caught on in
Europe and is expected to grow is SMS, a text-based messaging
service. The service was initially developed so telephone users
could send each other quick text messages like those on pagers.
Recently, though, companies have begun developing commercial
applications for the service, like sending users news headlines and
movie listings.
</P>
<P>
   Since the SMS messaging capacity is already built into phones
that use the GSM standard, it is likely to remain a popular
function even after the introduction of WAP, Yasskin predicted.
</P>
<P>
   With so much information to deliver and so little screen space
to deliver it to, it is unclear whether advertising banners like
those on the Web will support the new hand-held ventures. So who is
going to pay for it all?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the big question,'' Yasskin said.

the last decade, most notably taking the life of John Curry, the
1976 Olympic champion. Galindo, decided to speak about HIV because
the truth has always been liberating for him, especially in a sport
where rumor and gossip often take on the force of fact. ``Being
openly gay, having the cards laid on the table, made everything
easier for me in skating and making my choices in whatever road I
took in life,'' he says. (Tim Shaffer/The New York Times)

   WEST ORANGE, N.J. _ Robert Wheeler was explaining the two-word
slogan stitched across the back of his black satin baseball jacket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ukulele Consciousness,'' he said carefully, ``is an awareness
of ukuleles and their history and their place in society. And it's
a way to gain serenity.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler, 65, has 169 ukuleles back home in Littleton, Mass., and
he had just bought two more, but he does not like to be called a
collector.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people hear `collector,''' he said, ``they want to talk
about monetary value. But money just distracts from the true value
of ukuleles.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is what?
</P>
<P>
   ``Spiritual,'' he said, unblinking.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the 140 brave souls who packed the Councilwoman Toby
Katz Civic Center here for Ukulele Expo 2000 came to shop. Some
came to learn new chord fingerings at the workshops, or gawk at the
antique ukes, or hear a few songs from old-timers or modern
Hawaiian virtuosos.
</P>
<P>
   Others came to see the inductions into the Ukulele Hall of Fame
of a master instrument-maker, Sam Kamaka of Hawaii; Cliff Edwards,
a performer better known as Ukulele Ike, and May Singhi Breen, New
York City's Ukulele Lady of the 20s and 30s.
</P>
<P>
   But in truth, all came to spend a weekend in the arms of a
supportive community, where they could indulge their passion for
the most maligned instrument this side of the kazoo without
embarrassment or apology, in a place where every plink was a
droplet in a swelling ocean of ukulele consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing to see all these people here,'' said Peter
Stuart, an Upper West Side computer programmer who plays in a ``hot
vaudeville'' group called Ewa's Hawaiians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is,'' said Ewa Noskowicz, 34, sitting beside him.
``It seems like the ukulele has been kind of a joke instrument and
no one wants to admit to playing it.''
</P>
<P>
   The ukulele (pronounced oo-koo-LAY-lay in its native Hawaii) is
enjoying one of its periodic surges in popularity, said Nuni Walsh,
a director of the Ukulele Hall of Fame Museum (a largely virtual
institution, consisting of a group of devotees in several states
and their ukes). As a resident of West Orange, Walsh was also a
de-facto hostess of the event.
</P>
<P>
   Ukulele makers are springing into business all over the country,
and the venerable C.F. Martin &AMP; Co., the country's biggest maker of
acoustic guitars, has just started mass-producing ukuleles again
after a 20-year hiatus.
</P>
<P>
   Japan and the West Coast are the centers of the new cult of the
ukulele. But the expo, held in the New York area for the first time
after three previous ones in Rhode Island and Massachusetts, sold
out well in advance, and many would-be attendees were turned away
at the door.
</P>
<P>
   Experts cited several possible reasons for the revival.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Beloff, a former associate publisher of Billboard who quit
his job in 1998 to make a slope-sided, flat-bottomed uke called the
Fluke and has sold 2,300 of them in nine months, said many mature
folkies, whom he called ``lapsed guitarists,'' were out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who, due to the demands of family life or a
career, have fallen away from the guitar,'' he said. For them, he
said, the uke makes perfect sense.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how their numbers grow, ukulele players get no
respect. Tiny Tim is a sore point.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did some damage,'' said Walsh, who prefers more traditional
jazz-influenced Hawaiian players like Eddie Kamae and Israel
Kamakawiwo'ole. ``He's very cute and we like him, but in terms of
people's image of a ukulele player, it's not the image we want to
come into people's minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Others defended Tiny Tim. Wheeler credited him with keeping the
ukulele alive during the post-Arthur-Godfrey era of public disdain.
Beloff praised his encyclopedic knowledge of Tin Pan Alley
classics.
</P>
<P>
   And many attendees, Walsh conceded, have only themselves to
blame for the ukulele's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the people are real kooky,'' she said. ``I love them
all, but as you can imagine, someone who's really into the ukulele
can be kind of kooky.''
</P>
<P>
   The high point Sunday was a medley that started with Fred
Fallin, a retired schoolteacher in a sailor hat, and Bill Watson,
an old vaudevillean from Richmond, Va., and spread like wildfire.
</P>
<P>
   When the chorus of ``Nagasaki'' (``Back in Nagasaki where the
men all chew tobacky and the women wicky-wacky-woo'') rolled
around, a couple more pickers had joined in, and as Fallin, sweat
running down his face, finished off ``Do the Raccoon'' and got into
``Collegiate,'' a big hit for Fred Waring and His Pennsylvanians in
the 20s, the ensemble included five more sets of fingers, including
a mandolin player.
</P>
<P>
   Many said the ukulele had turned their lives around. Wheeler
found the instrument after his third marriage collapsed. Denny
Moynahan, an actor from Hollywood who performed in a grass skirt as
King Kukulele, got a uke after breaking up with a girlfriend, and
perfected his act on a yearlong trip around the world.

KINGS GET GOOD PLAYOFF TUNE-UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- Playing the Mighty Ducks on Sunday was the perfect
way to end the Kings' regular season. Despite their record, the
Ducks look an awful lot like the Detroit Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   Even though they now have missed the postseason four years in a
row, the Ducks have the speed, quick-strike offense and aggressive
defense to give the Kings a glimpse of their first-round playoff
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it isn't expected to be as easy as the Kings' 4-3
overtime victory that was played in front of 17,174 at the Pond.
But even though the Kings will enter Thursday's opener in Detroit
as overwhelming underdogs, they probably learned a little about
Steve Yzerman and Sergei Fedorov by watching Paul Kariya and Teemu
Selanne.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very good team we played today and I'm not sure why
they aren't in the playoffs,'' defenseman Mattias Norstrom said.
``They are very fast, much like Detroit. The Red Wings probably
have more weapons but if you can defense the Ducks, it's good for
your confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   That was boosted by losing just once in their final 10 games.
When they qualified for the playoffs two years ago, the Kings
limped to the finish line and were swept by the St. Louis in the
first round.
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't hurt that the Kings finish the season two games
over .500 (18-16-7) on the road. However long the playoffs last,
most of it will be spent away from home.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is something we've been working on since training camp,''
said captain Rob Blake, who returned to the lineup after missing
three games with a bruised left knee. ``If you keep your composure
on the road, positive things can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the Kings also took advantage of a vulnerable goaltender
in Guy Hebert, who looked shaky on the Kings' final two goals. If
Detroit has a weakness it's goaltender Chris Osgood, who has come
under fire from coach Scotty Bowman for inconsistency.
</P>
<P>
   Hebert, playing in his 400th game with the Ducks, had dominated
the Kings the past two seasons, going 7-0-2 before losing last
Saturday in their playoff clincher at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   But Blake gave the Kings a 3-2 lead with a long goal that sailed
through Hebert's legs. Selanne tied it five minutes later with his
second goal of the game and 33rd of the season. But Glen Murray
provided the game winner 1:05 into overtime when he also beat
Hebert between the pads.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you keep getting shots on net, you never know,'' said
Murray, who finished with 29 goals. ``We just stayed aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings were fully aware that the Ducks might come in deflated
after getting eliminated Friday night. They beat the Predators 5-1
in Nashville. But just hours later Edmonton came back from a 3-1
third-period deficit to beat Vancouver in overtime and claim the
final playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings also were playing without Ziggy Palffy, who has missed
the past month nursing a sprained right shoulder. The Kings medical
staff decided Saturday to keep Palffy out of action until the
playoff opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``With practice, he can get a good one-hour non-stop workout
every day,'' coach Andy Murray said. ``In a game, he isn't going to
play more than 20-22 minutes. There is a certain rhythm you lose
not playing in a game, but the time off will help him more.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings will not skate today, but will meet with the coaches
and plot strategy for Detroit. As for the Ducks, who finish the
season (34-36-12), they are he heading home for the fourth
consecutive year. Selanne looks at the Kings a and isn't sure why.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had good success against them,'' he said. ``It's not
like they're getting in because they beat us. We played well in our
division, but there were games in the East where we did not come up
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Kings are heading East, hoping they learned a few
things from the Ducks in order to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For the past few weeks we have played well and I think that is
something that will carry over to the playoffs,'' Norstrom said.
``This is no longer a six-month season it is a two-week season. We
just have to continue to play well for the next two weeks and see
where it takes us.''

FROM JUMPING FLEA TO COLLEGIATE CRAZE

<P>
   The ukulele is a descendent of a Portuguese instrument called
the braguinha that arrived in Hawaii in 1879 with a boatload of
Portuguese immigrants. The islands' royal family embraced the
braguinha and had it played at hula dances and other ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the braguinha was being redesigned to make it
easier to play, according to ``The Ukulele: A Visual History,'' by
Jim Beloff (Miller Freeman Books, 1997). Manuel Nunes, one of the
original Portuguese immigrants, standardized the tuning to match
that of the four highest strings on the guitar and replaced the
metal strings with catgut. Soon the instrument was known as the
ukulele _ Hawaiian for ``jumping flea,'' an apparent reference to
the way fingers dance on its strings, although several other
etymologies have been offered.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in the uke was mostly local until around the time of
the 1915 Panama Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco,
where there was a major exhibition of Hawaiian culture. The ukulele
and its Hawaiian sibling the steel guitar exploded across mainland
popular music.
</P>
<P>
   Tin Pan Alley cranked out song after song with titles like
``Under the Ukulele Tree,'' ``My Honolulu Ukulele Baby'' and
``Hello Hawaii, How are You?'' Ukuleles were sold by the millions
in every conceivable variety _ pineapple-shaped ukes,
teardrop-shaped ukes, banjo ukuleles.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Edwards, also known as ``Ukulele Ike,'' is reputed to have
sold 70 million records, and Admiral Richard Byrd's 1928 expedition
to the South Pole took along several dozen ukuleles to while away
the freezing nights.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the 1920s, enthusiasm for the uke had begun to
wane, only to be nearly single-handedly revived in the 1940s and
early 50s by the ubiquitous television and radio performer Arthur
Godfrey.
</P>
<P>
   Ukuleles made of a new miracle substance called plastic
proliferated. More than nine million were sold. Many rock and folk
musicians of the last thirty years, including Joni Mitchell,
Stephen Stills and Tracy Chapman, cut their musical teeth on
ukuleles.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1960s, however, the ukulele had declined again,
notwithstanding Tiny Tim's 1968 rendition of Nick Lucas' 1929
falsetto hit, ``Tiptoe Through The Tulips.''
</P>
<P>
   Interest in the uke declined even in Hawaii, but in the 1990s,
younger virtuoso players like the Ka'au Crater Boys and the late
Israel Kamakawiwo'ole have brought about another revival.

INVASIVE MUSSELS TURN UP IN LAKE THOUGHT TO BE IMMUNE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Mich., Fla.)  By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A year and a half ago, it looked as if Lake George, a blue jewel
in the green Adirondacks, had dodged a biological bullet _ the
zebra mussel, an invasive European mollusk that is clogging pipes,
crowding local aquatic life and turning beaches into toe-slicing
shell heaps from Michigan to the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists had found microscopic mussel larvae in the water,
probably imported in the bilges of boats. But lab tests showed that
some quirk of Lake George chemistry _ probably a lack of calcium _
seemed to keep them from maturing and reproducing. No adult mussels
could be found anywhere in the 32-mile-long lake.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, shoreside communities again face the prospect of an
invasion that could eventually choke drinking-water pumps, foul
outboard motors and deter tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of mature mussels have been found in the south end of
the lake. Scientists say the mussels seem to be confined to a
60-foot-wide band of water along 250 feet of shoreline. But once
mussels appear in a body of water, even one where conditions are
not ideal, they eventually seem to adapt and multiply rapidly, said
Sandra Nierzwicki-Bauer, the director of the Darrin Fresh Water
Institute of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., and a
biologist who has spent years studying the mussels.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, divers from Rensselaer and from a Lake George diving
group began systematically pulling the mussels from the affected
area, in the village of Lake George, which is packed with fishing
boats in the summer. The mussels, which the divers are pulling up
by hand, are thought by scientists to move from lake to lake mainly
by hitchhiking on boats.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the best of our ability, the goal is to remove as many as
we're able to find,'' Nierzwicki-Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   She added that the discovery of the mussels left her ``a little
red-faced,'' because 1998 lab tests appeared to show that the lake
was safe from invasion. ``It seems like every time someone says
zebra mussels won't be able to exist in some particular body of
water,'' she said, ``the next thing you know, they're there.''
</P>
<P>
   The hope, Nierzwicki-Bauer said, is to cull the colony before
the lake water warms to 55 degrees or so, the prime breeding
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   If the effort fails, the mussels may take hold and _ as they
have done in so many other waters _ multiply rapidly, coat the
shallows in a thick mat, suck oxygen from the water and filter out
plankton that would be food for local species.
</P>
<P>
   The mussels were discovered in December by two divers from
Bateaux Below, a nonprofit group whose members survey the lake's
dozens of 18th-century shipwrecks. The divers had been on the
lookout for mussels for fear that they might engulf and destroy the
wrecks, many of which are rare vessels from the French and Indian
War.
</P>
<P>
   The divers, Bob Benway and Joseph Zarzynski, were cleaning up
sunken litter at the south end of the lake, in an annual volunteer
program.
</P>
<P>
   Groping on the bottom in near-freezing, chest-deep water, Benway
hauled up a brown beer bottle and saw two dark, thumbnail-size
shells attached. ``I'd been trained to recognize them,'' he said,
``and there was no doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, he said, he hoped that it was a fluke, a bottle that
had been tossed from the shore or a boat. But quickly they
determined otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   The men called state conservation officials and the institute at
Rensselaer, and soon a broader survey of the lake bottom was under
way.
</P>
<P>
   Nierzwicki-Bauer said individual mussels were scattered on the
bottom, but, here and there were clusters of dozens, particularly
where there was some smooth or hard surface. ``They really seem to
love garbage, plastic cups, Frito bags and so forth,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said it immediately became clear that this was a
functioning, reproducing colony. ``Since we found them in different
sizes, from fairly large to small, the only conclusion was that not
all of those were transported to the lake,'' she said. ``Some of
them had reproduced there.''
</P>
<P>
   A prime question was why. If the lake is generally not alkaline
enough or sufficiently rich in calcium to support the mussels, she
said, why were they growing at this spot?
</P>
<P>
   Tests of water in the area and in streams and culverts along the
shore may have found the answer, Nierzwicki-Bauer said. The water
flowing into the lake from one culvert contains calcium at a
concentration that is four times higher than the average for the
lake waters, she said. The culvert empties into the lake just a few
yards north of where the mussels were found, she said, and a weak
current runs south along that shore.
</P>
<P>
   Nierzwicki-Bauer said it was possible that the culvert had
unusually high calcium levels because it disgorged both ground
water, which is naturally high in calcium, and storm runoff, which
can carry de-icing chemicals that contain much calcium.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists and some local officials concerned about the
mussels have begun discussing whether it makes sense to divert or
treat the culvert water. But for now, Nierzwicki-Bauer said, ``the
first order of business is to get the mussels out of the lake.''
</P>
<P>
   Nierzwicki-Bauer and other biologists said it remained to be
seen whether the removal effort would be enough to keep the mussels
in check or whether they would slowly adapt to the hostile lake
conditions and find a way to spread.
</P>
<P>
   Several mussel experts were not very optimistic. ``Once
something like this gets out in open waters in the open
environment, it's almost impossible to stop,'' said Amy Benson, a
fisheries biologist at a Gainesville, Fla., office of the U.S.
Geological Survey, which tracks zebra mussels and other invasive
species.
</P>
<P>
   She said Lake George might soon have to be added to a list that
includes hundreds of lakes and rivers in 20 states. ``They're there
to stay, I imagine,'' Benson said.

CELEBRATING NEW COMPANY WITH SOME ACCIDENTAL `SPAM' 
</HEADLINE>
   By TIM RACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The old joke about publicity goes: Print whatever you want; just
spell the name right. So for the record, the company's name is
spelled E-V-E-R-Y-P-A-T-H.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the story may or may not serve the publicity
purposes of Everypath, a Silicon Valley start-up that converts Web
information to a form that can be sent to hand-held devices over
wireless networks.
</P>
<P>
   Because the company had been keeping a low profile, it is likely
that few journalists had even heard of Everypath before a week ago
Saturday. But as hundreds of business reporters and editors checked
their e-mail that day, they found a message sent the night before
from someone with an address at everypath.com.
</P>
<P>
   The subject line read ``Partner Launch Status,'' and an attached
document contained a status report _ evidently for some sort of
event to introduce a new business in which the partners would
include Intel, Hewlett-Packard and Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   But within two hours, another e-mail message had arrived from
everypath.com, this time with the subject line ``We apologize for
the accidental spam ....''
</P>
<P>
   In the second message, Everypath's communications director,
Giselle Bisson, explained that an employee ``working long hours on
our launch'' had meant to send the first message only to the
executive staff _ but accidentally copied it to the entire
invitation list for the company's coming-out party. Bisson's note
added, ``Please do not reply to that message or you will get
hundreds of out-of-office replies and junk e-mails.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, asking hundreds of reporters and editors to not reply
to even an accidental public relations ``spamming'' is like posting
a ``No food fights'' sign in a junior-high cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   All across America, sticky mouse fingers began stabbing at the
reply or reply-to-all button. Soon, e-mail boxes were overflowing
with messages labeled ``Re: Partner Launch Status'' and ``Re: We
apologize for the accidental spam ....'' Hundreds of messages.
</P>
<P>
   Some were hostile, like: ``I hate PR people. They waste the one
precious thing in this work: TIME!'' from
editor(at)siliconalleyreporter.com.
</P>
<P>
   Some were forgiving, like: ``I've known Giselle B. for many
years, and she is a consummate professional, who I am sure was not
directly responsible for this fiasco,'' from
rsantalesa(at)smartedge.com.
</P>
<P>
   Then others became even more hostile, as in the big red letters:
``STOP YOU MORONS. EACH TIME YOU HIT REPLY YOU SEND TO THE SEVERAL
THOUSAND PEOPLE ON THIS IDIOTIC MAILING LIST,'' from
CEO(at)e-shortcut.com.
</P>
<P>
   The spamming angered some executives involved in the plans,
Bisson said. But the party did proceed _ a 1920s-theme event last
Wednesday night in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Those in attendance included Helen Spade, the Everypath
executive whose wayward e-mail had set off the spam fight. Spade
said people at the company had tried to make her feel better after
her mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past few days I feel like Monica Lewinsky,'' Spade
wrote in reply to an e-mail query, ``but I didn't have nearly as
much fun as her, and didn't even get a cigar out of it.''

SAMPRAS CAPS U.S. COMEBACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD - Throughout this week's Davis Cup quarterfinal, from
the early-week practices to the matches, people have called Pete
Sampras a champion. Not just because he has won a record-tying 12
Grand Slams, but because he finds a way to win.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, perhaps the greatest of hometown players, proved
everyone correct in Sunday's decisive match and brought some needed
redemption for himself and U.S. tennis.
</P>
<P>
   In front of numerous friends and family among the 12,002 fans,
and after being outplayed on Friday, Sampras fought off an
inconsistent backhand and a quadriceps injury to beat the Czech
Republic's Slava Dosedel 6-4 , 6-4, 7-6 (7-2) Sunday at the Great
Western Forum, giving the United States its second consecutive
come-from-behind 3-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. rallied to beat Zimbabwe in February's first round,
causing plenty of hugging and flag waving among the team and its
followers. Since that match was in Africa, it felt better Sunday
for Sampras, Andre Agassi and John McEnroe to take victory laps
around the court, holding the flag behind them, for they are in the
semifinals against Spain July 21-23.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras was the hero, but his herculean efforts wouldn't have
happened had Agassis not won earlier. Agassi cooled the hot Jiri
Novak 6-3, 6-3 , 6-1, tiring the Czech with trips across the
baseline and mixing in 12 aces.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday's shocker, Sampras was visibly despondent, looking
stunned as he told of being outplayed by someone ``in the zone.''
Not mentioned was his disappointment that his parents, who haven't
seen him play too much in his career, witnessed his worst Davis Cup
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   How sweet is must have felt when Sampras hugged his father, Sam,
after winning Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   When Sampras was in his early 20s, he said he was so focused on
tennis that family came second. He even moved to Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's 28 and moved back here last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The older you get, you appreciate your parents,'' Sampras
said. ``Having them here today was a great moment for my parents.
... My dad doesn't see me play a lot. He's never been to Wimbledon,
which is so much a part of my career. I want them to be a part of
my tennis life. Plus, the Forum's close to their home, so they had
to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras' parents, like everyone else, saw him dominate Dosedel
with his serve, which more than made up for his backhand
deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   Hurting his quadriceps in the first set affected his backhand,
but Sampras still can serve, rocketing most of his 18 aces past
Dosedel at more than 120 mph. It didn't matter he was on his first
or second serve, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got one of the best serves in the world, and I figure I
should use it,'' Sampras said. ``I got into a great rhythm. My arm
felt loose and strong. Even if I got a couple of doubles (faults),
I was confident. ''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best serve in the history of tennis,'' U.S. captain
McEnroe said. ``I've never seen anybody who's had a better one.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras broke Dosedel in the first set to go ahead 3-1. In the
second set, after breaking Dosedel to go up 5-4, Sampras leaped and
did a Tiger Woods kind of fist pump.
</P>
<P>
   In the third-set tiebreak, Sampras went up 6-2 after breaking
his string while returning Dosedel's serve, then placing a
backhander down the line. He skipped to the bench to get a new
racket then held serve, finishing the match with a service winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slava was playing his best tennis, but it wasn't enough for
`Pistol Pete,' '' Czech captain Jan Kukal said. ``His serve was too
unreturnable for anybody today.''

CLAIRE TREVOR, 91, VERSATILE ACTRESS, DIES 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Claire Trevor, an Academy Award-winning actress who epitomized
cynical but warm-hearted careerists _ reporters, gun molls, saloon
entertainers and trollops _ died Saturday at a hospital near her
home in Newport Beach, Calif. She was 91 and had suffered from
respiratory ailments in recent months, said Richard Elbaum, a
spokesman for the family.
</P>
<P>
   A Brooklyn native who became enamored of stage acting and found
her way into the movies during Hollywood's golden age, Trevor
appeared in nearly 70 films, working under legendary directors like
John Huston and John Ford and playing alongside such famous leading
men as John Wayne and Humphrey Bogart.
</P>
<P>
   She played the former girlfriend of a gangster (Humphrey Bogart)
who becomes a burned-out streetwalker in ``Dead End'' (1937) and a
freewheeling woman forced out of town by bluenoses in the classic
version of ``Stagecoach'' (1939). She was the alcoholic mistress of
a mobster played by Edward G. Robinson in ``Key Largo'' (1948) and
a spunky jet passenger in ``The High and the Mighty'' (1954).
</P>
<P>
   She may be best remembered for ``Key Largo,'' for which she won
the Oscar for best supporting actress playing the part of Gaye
Dawn, a has-been cabaret singer who, in one emotionally charged
scene, is forced by her sadistic lover to sing ``Moanin' Low'' in
return for a drink. Feebly, she manages to sob through the song,
but Robinson's character denies her because, he says, her singing
was ``rotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Trevor also received Academy Award nominations for ``The High
and the Mighty'' and ``Dead End.''
</P>
<P>
   The blond, smoky-voiced Trevor was a dedicated performer who
repeatedly breathed fresh life into her films, many of which sorely
needed her grace and gumption. Early on she became a ``queen of the
Bs,'' the low-budget action movies that rounded off double bills.
But she got plenty of ``A'' roles, making the most of them.
</P>
<P>
   In other key roles, she was a faithless lover in ``The Amazing
Dr. Clitterhouse'' (1938), a conspiratorial killer in ``Murder, My
Sweet'' (1945), a vitriolic Broadway actress in ``The Velvet
Touch'' (1948), an overprotective mother in ``Marjorie
Morningstar'' (1958) and a scornful shrew in two melodramas, ``Two
Weeks in Another Town'' (1962) and ``How to Murder Your Wife''
(1965).
</P>
<P>
   The modest Trevor was one of the few actresses whose seemingly
effortless talent made most viewers take her for granted, while
film buffs cherished her. Looking back, she concluded that she
never became a top star because she lacked the drive that energizes
them. ``I didn't know,'' she said, ``that to make a real career in
Hollywood you have to become a `personality,' have to cultivate
publicity departments and become known as `The Ear' or even `The
Toe.'''
</P>
<P>
   On television, she won an Emmy award in an acclaimed 1956
revival of ``Dodsworth,'' with Fredric March in the title role. She
artfully portrayed his vain wife, who consorts with shallow lovers
in a futile battle against age. Trevor said she enjoyed working for
television because it provided her with a wider, more sympathetic
range of roles. But she said she never wanted to sacrifice personal
happiness for her career. ``As for a TV series, never,'' she said,
``Life's too short and, frankly, I'm not terribly ambitious.''
</P>
<P>
   Claire Trevor was born Claire Wemlinger on March 8, 1909, in
Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, the only child of Noel and Betty Wemlinger.
( Elbaum said Trevor's stepson, Donald Bren, said she was born in
1910; many reference works list her birth in 1909.) Her father was
a Fifth Avenue merchant tailor who soon moved the family to
Larchmont in Westchester County. After her graduation from high
school, Trevor took art courses for six months at Columbia
University before studying for six more months at the American
Academy of Dramatic Arts. She began honing her craft in repertory
theater in Michigan, St. Louis and Long Island and through shorts
filmed in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   These appearances led to starring roles in two Broadway plays,
``Whistling in the Dark,'' a hit, and ``The Party's Over,'' a flop.
The Fox movie company had noticed her, however, and offered a
five-year contract. Although she wanted to stay in the theater, she
had no immediate stage prospects and accepted Fox's offer, arriving
in Hollywood in 1933.
</P>
<P>
   She then made 14 Fox quickies over four years. Most were
action-adventure pictures dominated by the leading men, but she won
wide praise for playing several hard-bitten newspaper reporters.
``I worked like a demon, and I knew it was a job,'' she said in an
interview with The Los Angeles Times in 1995. ``Saturday night, you
never could plan on going out to dinner because we'd break for
dinner for one hour and work till 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer Tracy was the early co-star she admired most, and she
said she quickly began imitating ``the clever way he throws away a
line.'' Another favorite leading man was Robinson, with whom she
appeared in ``Big Town,'' a popular radio series, from 1937 to
1940. He played Steve Wilson, editor of the mythical Illustrated
Press, and she was Lorelei Kilbourne, his ace reporter and foil.
</P>
<P>
   Her longtime wish to return to Broadway materialized in 1947,
when she and Philip Dorn co-starred in a comedy, ``The Big Two.''
The consensus of critics was that they gave the play much more
artistry and vitality than it deserved. It closed after 21
performances.
</P>
<P>
   Her private life was far different from the lives of the sassy
characters she played. She was married to Clark Andrews, director
of her radio show, from 1938 to 1942, when they divorced. In 1943
she married Cylos Dunsmoore, a Navy lieutenant. The marriage
produced a son, Charles, but ended in divorce in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Her third marriage, to Milton Bren, a film producer, lasted from
1948 until his death in 1979 of a brain tumor. Bren had two sons
from a previous marriage, later prompting Trevor to recall fondly
that they had ``an instant family.'' In 1978 Trevor lost her son,
Charles, in an airliner disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of her son and husband in the span of a year left her
devastated. She moved to New York, settling into a Fifth Avenue
apartment and embarking on a busy social schedule. She also
occasionally returned to acting, in her last role playing an aging
schoolteacher in the 1987 television movie ``Norman Rockwell's
Breaking Home Ties.''
</P>
<P>
   Trevor later returned to California, where she also became known
as a generous philanthropist.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by her stepsons, Donald Bren, chairman of the
Irvine Co., a real estate investment firm in Newport Beach, and
Peter Bren, president of Koll-Bren-Schreiber, a real estate
investment firm in New York.

SY WEINTRAUB, 76, MOVIE PRODUCER WHO BROADENED TARZAN'S VOCABULARY
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sy Weintraub, the film producer who in the 1950s breathed new
life into Tarzan's flagging celluloid career, died April 4 at his
home in Beverly Hills, Calif. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pancreatic cancer, Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
   Under the tutelage of Weintraub, who bought the rights to the
Tarzan franchise in 1958, Edgar Rice Burroughs' jungle hero
metamorphosed from a loincloth-wearing, knife-carrying,
monosyllabic strongman into a well-mannered, soft-spoken, even
introspective gentleman worthy of the new James Bond era.
</P>
<P>
   Weintraub decided that Tarzan would be more exciting to women
without his all-American wife, Jane, so the character was
discarded. Out, too, went the hokey safaris set on Hollywood studio
back lots and the grunt-and-groan scripts.
</P>
<P>
   Weintraub's newfangled Tarzan was a man of the world, and his
adventures were shot in color on locations in India, Kenya, Mexico
and Thailand. His chimpanzee sidekick hung around just long enough
for Tarzan to say ``So long, Cheetah'' after Weintraub discovered
that the apes cast for the role were terrified of the real jungle.
The loincloth stayed, but nary a yodel was heard from Jock Mahoney,
the former stuntman who was the first of the new Tarzans, as he
swung into action on a parachute rather than a vine.
</P>
<P>
   With borrowed money, Weintraub financed the films himself and
then entered into distribution deals with studios under which he
shared revenue and retained television rights and income,
eventually amassing a fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Later Tarzans included Mike Henry, a former football player who
appeared in ``Tarzan and the Valley of Gold,'' and Gordon Scott, in
``Tarzan's Greatest Adventure.'' Frank Gifford, then of the New
York Giants, was reported to have turned down a chance to play
Tarzan in 1964. Ron Ely donned the loincloth in the successful
1960's television series on NBC. Weintraub also lured such actors
as Sean Connery, Anthony Quayle and Helen Hayes into Tarzan's new
world.
</P>
<P>
   As his deal with the Burroughs estate neared an end in 1984,
Weintraub turned to the daughter of another childhood literary
hero, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, in pursuit of the rights to Sherlock
Holmes. In 1983 he and the producer Otto Plaschkes made two Holmes
films, ``The Hound of the Baskervilles'' and ``The Sign of Four,''
starring the British actor Ian Richardson as the famous sleuth. The
films failed to find theater distribution and were shown on
television.
</P>
<P>
   A native of New York, Weintraub served in the Army during World
War II, directing Stars and Stripes productions, before working his
way through the University of Missouri as a waiter, furnace stoker
and sports writer. After completing a television production course
at the American Theater Wing in New York, he borrowed $2,000 and
helped to found Flamingo Films, a television syndication company.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Weintraub held the titles of chairman of the
board of Panavision, president of the National General Television
Corp. and chairman of the executive committee of the board of
Columbia Pictures Industries.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by two daughters, Lori Weintraub of Los Angeles
and Cindy Shrieve of Seattle, and four grandchildren.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Helen Ratnoff Plotz, who earned praise for compiling
and editing almost a score of anthologies of poetry, mostly for
young adults, died March 30 at her home in Brooklyn. She was 87.
</P>
<P>
   In a review of the anthology ``The Gift Outright: America and
Her Poets'' (1977), Deborah Churchman wrote in The Christian
Science Monitor that Plotz was ``an outstanding collector of
poems'' who included admirers and detractors in her compilation.
</P>
<P>
   Plotz also compiled ``Untune the Sky: Poems of Music and the
Dance'' (1957).
</P>
<P>
   Her 1981 anthology, ``Gladly Learn and Teach: Poems of the
School Experience,'' was selected as an Ambassador of Honor Book by
English-Speaking Union Books-Across-the-Sea. Her last anthology was
``A Week of Lullabies'' (1988).
</P>
<P>
   She was a member of the Children's Books Committee of the Child
Study Association and of the Committee on Childhood Education of
the Public Education Association.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Brooklyn, she graduated from Girls Commercial High
School (now Prospect Heights High) and from Vassar College.
</P>
<P>
   She married Dr. Milton Plotz in 1933. He died in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving are two daughters, Elizabeth Wagman of Brooklyn and
Sarah Jacobs of London; two sons, Paul, of Washington, and John, of
Berkeley, Calif.; seven grandchildren; two great-grandchildren; and
a brother, Dr. Oscar Ratnoff of Cleveland.

EDITORIAL: STRATEGIES FOR SAFER BLOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, April 10: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Blood safety is becoming an important factor in combating the
global spread of AIDS. The World Health Organization estimates that
between 5 and 10 percent of transmissions of HIV, the virus that
causes AIDS, occur through the transfusion of infected blood or
blood products.
</P>
<P>
   A new survey by the agency found that more than two-thirds of
the world's nations do not have adequate policies to insure a safe
blood supply. Of the 75 million units of blood donated each year
throughout the world, nearly 20 percent are not screened for either
HIV or other agents that cause hepatitis B and C, syphilis and
malaria. The poorest developing nations are the hardest hit by
infectious disease, and have been least able to test or monitor
blood safety. They are also least able to bear the long-term
economic and human costs of AIDS or other diseases spread by unsafe
blood.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing this crisis, the WHO has begun a new campaign to
improve blood safety worldwide. Blood screening is essential, but
for poorer nations, the costs can be prohibitive. The Clinton
administration is seeking a $100 million increase in next year's
budget to combat AIDS abroad, with part of that increase to be used
for blood testing programs. But testing must be supplemented by
good laboratory practices, standards for safe storage and
transportation of blood, and reliance on voluntary, unpaid blood
donors. In poorer countries, most of the blood supply still comes
from paid donors or family donors, who pose a risk because they may
conceal behaviors that make them unsuitable as donors.

A DIFFERENT DERBY TRIP FOR SAHADI
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ The first time Jenine Sahadi attended a
Kentucky Derby, she was a homesick University of Kentucky freshman
scandalized by the sight of the Woodstock-style crowd in the
Churchill Downs infield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember SWAT teams and naked people up the flagpole,''
Sahadi, trainer of Santa Anita Derby winner The Deputy, said of
that day in 1981, the year Pleasant Colony won the Kentucky Derby.
``I never saw a horse all day. It was a wild, wild scene. I was
right out of the Santa Catalina School for Girls. You can use your
imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   She got closer to the on-the-track action in 1983, when she
cheered from the box seats as her family's Desert Wine ran second
to Sunny's Halo.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a fun day,'' said Sahadi, who had transferred to USC
by then.
</P>
<P>
   It might turn out that neither experience was as intense as her
third Kentucky Derby trip will be. Sahadi will fly to Louisville
Thursday, a day after The Deputy's scheduled flight east, to get
the colt ready for the May 6 race.
</P>
<P>
   The Deputy, ridden by Chris McCarron when he won Saturday's
Santa Anita Derby by one length over War Chant, with Captain Steve
third and Anees fourth, is a small but well-conformed Irish-bred
whose consistent sharp efforts and even temper will entice Kentucky
Derby bettors.
</P>
<P>
   As for Sahadi, 37, the first woman to train a Santa Anita Derby
winner she'd also be the first to train a Kentucky Derby winner
said she'll be happy to talk to reporters about the vital role of
women in male-dominated thoroughbred racing.
</P>
<P>
   What she said she won't entertain are questions about her Santa
Anita Derby-week feud with Bob Baffert, trainer of Captain Steve
and two of the past three Kentucky Derby winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thinks I'm joking,'' Sahadi said. ``I will not talk
about it anymore. It's ancient history.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert, angry about newspaper criticism, said he didn't know
he'd touch a nerve when he asked McCarron at Thursday's
post-position draw ceremony, ``Who's training The Deputy, you or
Jenine?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a male chauvinist pig,'' Baffert said.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared Sunday morning that the top four Santa Anita Derby
finishers will go on to Kentucky. Neil Drysdale, trainer of War
Chant, hopes the colt, previously unbeaten in three starts, will
get better with experience. Baffert acknowledged Captain Steve must
improve on his recent races. Richard Mulhall, racing manager for
The Thoroughbred Corp, which owns Anees, looks for a faster pace to
set up the colt's late charge.
</P>
<P>
   D. Wayne Lukas said he'll defer to owner William T. Young on
whether fifth-place finisher Surfside goes to the Derby or returns
to the fillies division for the May 5 Kentucky Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Anita Derby, run in 1:49.08 for 1 miles on a dull
track, earned a Beyer speed figure of 109, the highest for a major
3-year-olds race in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Deputy was described by his trainer as healthy and ``proud
of himself'' Sunday morning. He could be the Derby favorite if
Fusaichi Pegasus, the only horse to beat him in the United States,
is unimpressive in next Saturday's Wood Memorial at Aqueduct in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Sahadi placed a box of sugar doughnuts on her barn desk to
welcome a stream of well-wishers and members of The Deputy's
dozen-member ownership syndicate. A congratulatory bouquet of
flowers and balloons lay on a sofa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to (the next four weeks). I'm looking
forward to being with the horse,'' Sahadi said. ``I'm thinking of
it as a once-in-a-lifetime shot.''

COURT BACKS 1927 BEQUEST ON WAR DEBT 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ World War I ended in 1918. A resident of
the Westchester County town of New Rochelle named James Bertram
died in 1934. But it took until last week for a court to approve
Bertram's request that part of his estate, which has grown to about
$4.3 million, go to the U.S. government to help repay Britain's
debts from that war.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken so long, in fact, that Britain long ago stopped
trying to pay those debts, and the United States apparently stopped
caring.
</P>
<P>
   Bertram cared deeply. In his will, written in 1927, Bertram, a
native of Scotland, left his money in a trust fund to his wife and
daughter with the provision that after they died, if there were no
other children or grandchildren, whatever was left should go to
repay some of the $4.2 billion Britain had borrowed from the United
States to finance its war effort before the Americans formally
entered the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``James, an astute businessman working for the Carnegie
Institute, was allegedly motivated by patriotic spirit when he
devised this gift to the UK,'' Judge Albert J. Emanuelli of
Westchester Surrogate's Court said in a decision last Wednesday.
``He simultaneously wished to help his adopted home, the USA.''
</P>
<P>
   Bertram's only child, Jean Ewing Bertram Underhill, died in
1996. She had no children.
</P>
<P>
   Over the objections of Underhill's estate, Emanuelli ruled that
since there were no other direct descendants, the will must be
enforced. A lawyer for Jean Underhill's estate had argued that the
money should go to a foundation she had set up to benefit animals
and finance scholarships for veterinary students.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, the judge said that Britain stopped paying its
World War I debt to the United States in 1934 and in 1947 stopped
carrying it on its official records as a debt, but that this did
not give him the legal authority to ignore Bertram's wishes. He
said it was irrelevant that the United States had made no effort to
collect from Britain, as there was no evidence that the United
States had waived its right to be repaid. He also noted that
Washington still listed the debt in a Treasury Department
publication, and that as of 1994, with the addition of interest, it
was put at more than $14 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Once the government got wind of the dispute over Bertram's will,
it joined in supporting the Bank of New York, the trustee to the
estate, which argued in court that Bertram's wishes be followed.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for Underhill's estate, Robert L. Ecker, said he did
not know whether he would appeal.

WALL STREET'S RACY INSIDER-TRADING TRIAL, AND A MISSING WITNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN SULLIVAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When federal prosecutors in Manhattan charged a Wall
Street chief executive last December with leaking confidential
stock information to an X-rated film star, it promised to be one of
the most salacious cases of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The star, Kathryn B. Gannon, was described by prosecutors as an
exotic dancer and actress who used the stage name Marylin Star. The
prosecutors charged that James J. McDermott Jr., the former chief
executive of the investment bank Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods, illegally
gave Gannon inside information on potential bank deals that enabled
her to make $88,000 in illegal profits on stock trades. She is also
accused of passing some of the information on to another investor.
</P>
<P>
   But it is unlikely that the jurors in the trial, which is to
begin Monday, will see any of the seamier side of the case. Gannon
has not appeared in Federal District Court in Manhattan to face the
charges against her, and is believed to be in Canada. And the judge
has told prosecutors that they cannot mention Gannon's career in
pornography.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she will be referred to as an actress and a dancer.
</P>
<P>
   Barring an unexpected development, such as an appearance by
Gannon or a change in the judge's ruling, it is likely that the
trial will proceed as a straightforward insider-trading case,
typical fare for a courthouse just a short walk from the financial
district.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors will try to prove that McDermott gave Gannon, with
whom they say he was having an affair, confidential information
about a series of bank takeovers. They say Gannon used the
information for stock trades and passed it on to a New Jersey
businessman, Anthony Pomponio, who has also been charged with
insider trading and with lying to the Securities and Exchange
Commission during the agency's investigation of the trades.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials have said McDermott is the first Wall Street
chief executive to be charged with insider trading.
</P>
<P>
   Both McDermott and Pomponio have pleaded not guilty in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's ruling on Gannon's work reflects one of the many
battles quietly fought as the case moved to trial. Prosecutors and
defense lawyers have jousted over several aspects of the case,
often over single words in a transcript, and references to Gannon's
work have been the subject of contention.
</P>
<P>
   In one letter to the trial judge, Kimba M. Wood, prosecutors
argued that it was important to mention pornography to establish
the relationship between the defendants and contended that
information about Gannon's occupation ``is highly relevant _
indeed, crucial _ to the government's case.''
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that references to X-rated films could be
distracting and inflammatory, the prosecutors said they had come up
with a compromise that would ``maintain the dignity of the
proceedings.'' The prosecutors offered to restrain from listing the
titles of Gannon's films, the content of her Web site, or from
offering ``photos depicting Gannon in a sexual context.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers objected to any mention of Gannon's occupation,
arguing that it had nothing to do with charges of insider trading.
For the most part, Wood agreed. ``My view on this issue remains the
same as at our last hearing, that is, that it is unduly prejudicial
and distracting for the jury to learn that Gannon was a porn
star,'' Wood said during a March hearing.
</P>
<P>
   When prosecutors asked to call Gannon an exotic dancer, Wood
deleted ``exotic.'' The prosecutors asked for adult-movie actress,
but the judge cut the ``adult.'' She did allow prosecutors to refer
to Gannon as a model and to her stage name.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Gannon will appear to answer the insider-trading charges
against her has been the subject of other hearings. Gannon, who is
a Canadian citizen, returned to Canada before she was charged,
although prosecutors have said she did so after receiving a
subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Prosecutors
have asked for delays to pursue extradition procedures, but the
defense has objected, arguing that it would violate the other
defendants' right to a speedy trial.
</P>
<P>
   Under the extradition treaty between the United States and
Canada, it is up to the Canadian Justice Department to detain
Gannon if officials believe there is sufficient evidence. A
spokesman for the department declined to comment on the case other
than to say Gannon has not been detained.
</P>
<P>
   Wood has made it clear that she was not willing to wait
indefinitely for Gannon to be brought to the United States. In a
hearing in February, defense lawyers said extradition could take
more than two years. Prosecutors said a more likely estimate was
more than a year.

COMMENTARY: THE SEARCH FOR TRUTH IN OLD BURIAL GROUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
  By TINA ROSENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In December 1981, the Atlacatl Battalion of the army of El
Salvador arrived in El Mozote, a hamlet in the war zone of Morazan.
Most of the local men, terrified of being labeled guerrillas, fled
to the mountains as the soldiers approached. But the women,
children and elderly remained. Over the next three days, soldiers
killed around 800 of them in the largest massacre of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven years later, El Mozote was invaded again. Four young
Argentines and a dozen or so Salvadorans, this time armed with
shovels and brushes, entered the hamlet and began to dig. The
Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team found the skeletons of at
least 143 people in El Mozote, 131 of them children under 12. But
because an amnesty law passed in 1993 is interpreted as barring
even the investigation of wartime crimes, the group was unable to
get permission to look at graves in the surrounding hamlets _ until
last week. Nineteen years after the massacre, families in the
villages of La Joya and Jocote Amarillo will soon receive the bones
of their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   The field of forensic anthropology _ the study of skeletal
remains for legal purposes _ is not new. But only since 1984 has it
been used as a human rights tool. Since then, small groups of
people have been finding and digging up skeletons in mass graves
and potters' fields around the world, trying to figure out who lies
buried and how they died. Exhumations have taken place in Iraqi
Kurdistan, Zimbabwe, Bosnia, Ethiopia, South Africa, Kosovo, East
Timor and various nations in Latin America, among other places.
Investigators for the war crimes tribunals for the former
Yugoslavia and Rwanda are performing hundreds of them.
</P>
<P>
   The exhumations have brought comfort to families and
communities. In a few cases, they have provided crucial evidence at
trials or proof of atrocities that galvanized a previously
indifferent public. A victim's testimony is easily dismissed by
those who wish not to believe it. ``But it's hard to argue with a
skull that has a gunshot wound to the back of the head,'' says
Clyde Snow, the Oklahoma forensic anthropologist who is the father
of the movement.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Argentina had just returned to democratic rule after
seven years of a murderous dictatorship. A truth commission was
trying to write the full story of that era's crimes. Its members
were learning a lot from the survivors, but very little from the
dead. Eric Stover, an official at the American Association for the
Advancement of Science in Washington, assembled a team of forensic
experts. It included Snow, who had examined skeletons as part of
criminal investigations all over the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The visiting Americans found few trained Argentines with whom
they could work _ the medical examiners' office was implicated in
the killings and torture, and other experts either wanted high
salaries or, quite understandably, were afraid. But a group of
anthropology students heard about the mission and showed up at
Snow's hotel to volunteer. A few days later, using string, spoons
and screens from their parents' houses, they performed their first
exhumation. The group eventually found more than 500 skeletons, and
Snow presented a dramatic slide show as testimony in the 1985 trial
of nine top junta members.
</P>
<P>
   Of the original Argentine students, three are still members of
the 11-person team. The group, which is financed by foundations and
European governments, has worked or helped to train local
investigators in more than 20 countries.
</P>
<P>
   The exhumation in the Guatemalan village of Rio Negro shows the
impact such work can have. Digging began in 1993, at the request of
courageous local citizens' groups. A team of Guatemalan students
trained largely by Snow found the skeletons of at least 143 people,
including 44 women and 99 children. In April 1994, the remains were
returned to the survivors of Rio Negro for a formal reburial with
full Catholic and Mayan ritual.
</P>
<P>
   The case was the first massacre investigation that received
extensive coverage in the Guatemalan press. The exhumation helped
achieve the only convictions that have resulted from the
scorched-earth massacres of the early 1980's _ although of
low-level triggermen. The Rio Negro publicity helped insure there
would be a truth commission, which described the armed forces'
slaughter of Mayan Indians as ``genocide.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Guatemalan forensic investigators, like the Argentines,
participate in digs around the world. Missing, however, is a
concentrated effort to train investigators in countries with
histories of mass murder. As advances in the use of DNA allow
easier identification of remains and as trials for human rights
abuses become more widespread, exhumations will be even more
valuable for exposing _ and thus helping to deter _ mass killings.
Murderers can count on eliminating or intimidating witnesses. Even
years later, however, forensic anthropology can make eloquent and
effective testimony from the silence of the dead.

 TOYSRUS.COM BUFFS UP FOR CHRISTMAS RUSH  &HT;     By CAROLYN SAID 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Toysrus.com is determined to have a merrier
Christmas this year.
</P>
<P>
   After suffering meltdowns in delivery and site access during the
1999 holiday season, the toy e-tailer is moving aggressively to
beef up its infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday the company will announce that it is setting up huge
fulfillment centers in Ontario, Calif., and Chambersburg, Pa., and
is refitting its existing Memphis, Tenn., warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the three facilities will have just short of 2 million
square feet of space. Each warehouse will be highly automated and
employ about 300 full-time workers, ramping up to 800 each over the
holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, we will have excess capacity. No one is going to
question our willingness to step up to the plate this year,'' said
chief executive John Barbour, who joined the firm in September 1999
_ too late to affect major changes before the crucial fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The company, a subsidiary of giant bricks-and-mortar chain Toys
R Us, has a fresh infusion of $57 million from Internet giant
Softbank Corp. A Toysrus.com spokesperson said the two new
facilities would cost about $26 million to $30 million each; a
figure for retrofitting the Memphis warehouse was not available.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a way of telling the world that Toysrus.com is going
to grow,'' said Sheldon Grodsky, an analyst with Grodsky Associates
in South Orange, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Barbour said Toysrus.com is also improving its Web site's
interface, which he admitted ``was a little bit clumsy'' and
increasing the amount of traffic it can handle to up to 60,000
simultaneous visitors.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half of November, the online store got so
overloaded that only 58 percent of people attempting to visit it
could get through.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in December, the company faced an unpleasant realization:
It couldn't guarantee delivery of some customers' orders in time to
for the holidays. Toysrus contacted affected customers and gave
them $100 vouchers so they could complete their shopping at any
Toys R Us store.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of TOY10 (43922 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Barbour said only about one day's worth of sales were affected,
but the company got hammered in the media. One customer filed a
class action suit over late deliveries and the Federal Trade
Commission began an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   For the five-week period ended December 26, Toysrus.com drew
more than 1.49 million shoppers, versus 1.66 million at rival
eToys, according to research firm Media Metrix.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg News reported that the Internet subsidiary had $50.9
million in 1999 sales _ a drop in the bucket compared to the parent
chain's $11 billion. Bloomberg said Toysrus.com's first-quarter
2000 sales were $10.6 million. Barbour declined to cite specific
numbers, but said first-quarter sales were 30 times greater than in
the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few months, Toysrus.com will add new channels for
BabiesRUs, the parent company's infant-care business, and Rzone,
its computer and electronics division.
</P>
<P>
   While not discounting a future spin-off to capitalize on
Internet stock valuations, Barbour said he values the online firm's
clicks-and-bricks synergies with the retail chain. When Internet
collectors snapped up Harley-Davidson Barbie, the site was able to
turn to its physical counterpart for more inventory. And when
stores sold out of Sega Dreamcasts ``virtually instantaneously''
after its September launch, Toysrus.com lent the real-world stores
a week's worth of its supply of the video game consoles.

TELLME TO OFFER INFORMATION VIA TELEPHONE 
</HEADLINE>
   By TODD WALLACK 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Some of the key people who brought the world the
Internet browser are now heading a company that has little to do
with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by former Netscape Communications and Microsoft
executives, TellMe Networks, a Palo Alto, Calif., company, instead
plans to offer information about everything from the weather to
stock quotes and a list of local restaurants via a toll-free
telephone number.
</P>
<P>
   TellMe plans to announce Monday that it is launching a trial of
the service and will make it available more widely in June.
</P>
<P>
   The service will mimic information services already offered
nationwide by newspapers and telephone companies.
</P>
<P>
   The two main differences between TellMe's service and existing
services is the company's extensive breath of topics, and the fact
that users won't have to rely on pressing keys on their touch tone
phone.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, TellMe uses computerized speech technology to accept
spoken commands like ``weather'' or ``stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has raised a total of $53 million from high-profile
investors, including the Barksdale Group, the venture capital firm
run by former Netscape Communications Corp. chief Jim Barksdale.
</P>
<P>
   The firm has been shrouded in secrecy for some time, but details
have been starting to dribble out since late last year.
</P>
<P>
   Heading up TellMe are chief executive Mike McCue and co-founder
Angus Davis, both from Netscape. Board member and vice president
Hadi Partovi &UR;  &LR; came from Microsoft, where he helped managed the
software company's Internet Explorer browser.
</P>
<P>
   TellMe executives are quick to point out that much of the
software used to power the information service relies on Internet
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technically, we consider ourselves an Internet company,'' said
spokeswoman Marci Gottleib. But the user just needs a telephone.

 FREE WEB SERVICES ARE STRUGGLING  &HT;     By TODD WALLACK 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It isn't easy being free. Just ask eFax.
</P>
<P>
   The Menlo Park, Calif., firm runs one of the world's best-known
free online fax services, with more than 2 million users, and has
ambitious plans to make money by selling ads and signing up users
for paid versions of its service.
</P>
<P>
   But some Wall Street investors appear to be losing faith in that
vision.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock was off 83 percent as of Friday. And last
week, eFax sold itself to Jfax for roughly $74 million in stock
(excluding debt), a pittance by Internet standards. The company was
running so low on cash that Jfax had to lend eFax $5 million to
help keep it afloat until the deal can be completed in July.
</P>
<P>
   Jfax, with 800,000 users and a market value of $144 million, is
doing only slightly better. Its stock is off 62 percent since it
first sold shares to the public last July. Though the company
offers free faxes, it also offers voice mail and e-mail and plans
to change its name to ``something without the word fax.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just free fax services that are losing favor on
Wall Street. Stock in NetZero, a Southern California company that
offers free Internet service to 2 million users, has sagged more
than 50 percent this year. It, too, is showing no signs of breaking
into the black.
</P>
<P>
   EFax chief executive Ronald Brown said Wall Street is no longer
willing to award giant valuations to companies just because they
have millions of users.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last summer, everyone was talking about (attracting) eyeballs
and building an installed base of users,'' Brown said. ``Now the
market is very much looking for tangible evidence of developing
revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there's no lack of interest from new players trying
to launch services and raise money. At least three companies this
year have unveiled plans to start offering free high-speed Internet
service over phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   And Freei Networks, a more traditional free Internet service
provider, announced plans last week to raise $172 million by
selling stock to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the stock slump, NetZero is still valued at $1.4
billion despite just $12 million in sales and a $25 million loss
during the last three months of last year.
</P>
<P>
   But Wall Street wasn't as kind to eFax.
</P>
<P>
   The company lost $10 million for the last three months of 1999,
including a $2 million charge related to its old business of making
computer cards for printing and faxing. Though growing, its eFax
business generated only $725,000 in revenue, not enough to impress
some investors. (Before the sale, the company planned to raise more
money from private investors to keep the business afloat, in
addition to the $60 million investors have already pumped into the
firm.)
</P>
<P>
   EFax executives said they were mystified when Phone.com in
Redwood City, Calif., bought Onebox.com, another unified messaging
service, for $787 million in February _ 10 times the value eFax
fetched. But Onebox.com, which claims more than 1 million active
users, said it had started to focus on a different market: selling
messaging services to wireless telecommunications companies that
could in turn peddle them to users. EFax has been marketing itself
directly to users, mainly professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Jfax, meanwhile, lost $4.4 million on $2.6 million in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jfax and eFax have potential to turn many of their 2.8
million users into paying customers and generate a profit, said
Mark Levitt, an analyst with International Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Both offer free phone numbers to users, and automatically route
faxes to users' e-mail. But they offer additional services, such as
letting users send faxes, for a fee. Already, Jfax has 60,000
paying subscribers and eFax has about 65,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they get users, they will get revenue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Levitt said investors have started to look harder at the
immediate potential for profits and revenues during the past six
months to a year. ``This is a fairly new phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   Fellow IDC analyst Steve Harris added:
</P>
<P>
   ``Wall Street is finally waking up to the fact that not all
these companies are going to be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris said NetZero is likely to survive, but many smaller free
ISPs could be squeezed as traditional companies such as banks offer
free Internet service as part of a package of services. ``It
doesn't bode well.''

MULTIHUED CREATURES AFOOT WITH JOHN CAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Any new dance piece by Merce Cunningham is worthy
of special attention; ``Interscape (2000),'' which was commissioned
by the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts here, sounds
good on paper and looks even better onstage.
</P>
<P>
   The ingredients are right, making for a visually striking
exercise in perception that recalls the Merce Cunningham Dance
Company's early creative collaborations.
</P>
<P>
   The music is a John Cage solo for cello, played by Loren Kiyoshi
Dempster. But Cage-fashion, the score offers choices and can also
be performed with an orchestra. On the eye-filling side, Robert
Rauschenberg, the troupe's resident designer from 1954 to 1964, has
come up with tricky, witty and stunning decor.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, the same images are seen in double. The front
curtain suggests a montage of smudged black-and-white photographs.
The backdrop has the same images in color, with a crayonish tint.
The objects depicted are from Rauschenberg's grab-bag vision of
life, civilization's artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   Among these are a large carousel horse, a wooden figurehead, a
frame house that suggests an old hotel and a terraced castle. The
pictures fly through space on a flat surface, disconcerting in
their overlapping assemblages and yet soothingly reminiscent of a
Victorian postcard. At the premiere of ``Interscape (2000)'' on
Thursday night at the Kennedy Center's Eisenhower Theater, the
dancers appeared to have postmarks imprinted on the multihued
leotards that Rauschenberg designed.
</P>
<P>
   That these wonderful creatures in shades of blue, green, pink
and orange were going somewhere was obvious in Cunningham's
choreography, which had leitmotifs that underwent sudden changes.
As a title, ``Interscape (2000)'' suggests connections between
sites.
</P>
<P>
   The dancers initially appear like ghostly blurs, barely visible
as the smudgy frontcloth turns transparent under Aaron Copp's
gorgeous lighting. As this curtain rises, Jeannie Steele and Derry
Swan are onstage in straight-legged positions, joined later by
three women. The choreography is full of details like arched backs
and small steps in place. Duets (especially by Holley Farmer and
Daniel Squire) initiate motifs that will recur: a head thrown back,
arms linked, back-to-back dancing and shifts of weight, sometimes
in the pelvis alone.
</P>
<P>
   The men have a habit of leaping in, adding a web of musculature
and volume to the women's lighter jumps. Non sequiturs abound. A
female septet, for example, suddenly rotates shoulders, with one
shoulder moved forward just before a soloist, Banu Ogan, with red
paint on her costume, is enclosed by a group.
</P>
<P>
   The central duet goes to Cedric Andrieux and to Lisa Boudreau,
whose blond curls make her look like a movie ingenue, especially
when she smiles at her partner after he has placed his hand in the
small of her back. There was a time when modern dance involved no
partnering. Cunningham is not one to live by other people's
conventions. The surprise of the duet is in its varied lifts. At
the end, the man is in profile and the woman, astride his shoulder,
faces the audience: a sharp image.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interscape (2000)'' is not one of Cunningham's overt
crowd-pleasers. It is a bit long, but its richness is in the
detail. Just as Rauschenberg's two curtains are the same with a
difference, so the choreography requires keen looking: its tone is
generally the same throughout, but there are unexpected moments. In
one, Ogan starts out with one leg behind the other, twists and
winds up in a plie, feet apart.
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to say that such technical points are for
specialists, but Cunningham knows how to theatricalize movement on
a formal level. The cast, superb and articulate, included Ashley
Chen, Maydelle Fason, David Kulick, Koji Minato, Robert Swinston
and Cheryl Therrien.
</P>
<P>
   A major contribution came from Dempster, the cellist in the pit
playing Cage's music. Cage died in 1992 and this score has not been
recorded. But according to Cage's instructions, the music for the
soloist, ``One8 ,'' may also be performed with an orchestral piece
for 108 musicians, titled ``108.'' Cunningham has left open that
possibility, or a program note suggests that the dancing could be
accompanied by orchestra only. On this occasion Dempster did a
capital job with a clear, rich sound that respected the built-in
silences and the range of the score, including its occasional
warblings and ululations.
</P>
<P>
   The program was completed by ``Summerspace'' and ``Pond Way,''
two Cunningham pieces of great beauty seen last summer at Lincoln
Center Festival '99. Unfortunately the company is not scheduled to
perform in New York until next year.

 BIOSCOPE: GENETICALLY ENGINEERED FOOD TOUTED AS HUNGER RELIEF  &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Opponents of genetically modified foods got
great media last year over the monarch butterfly, that charismatic
creature that seemed to choke on the pollen drift of so-called
``killer corn.''
</P>
<P>
   But now one detects a not-so-subtle change in the winds of
publicity, which increasingly depict bioengineered plants as the
best hope of feeding the Third World. In contrast to last year's
script, which cast Monsanto as corporate demon, the poster child of
the remake is the well-fed environmental elitist.
</P>
<P>
   A perfect example of this new genre is the favorable portrayal
of Monsanto chief executive Robert B. Shapiro in the April 10
edition of New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro is revealed to us as ``a thin almost painfully
contemplative Jew from the Upper West Side of Manhattan'' (a
factoid of ethnographic significance to New Yorkers, perhaps).
</P>
<P>
   This sensitive mensch, who still believes firmly that genetic
engineering can create disease-resistant crops to feed a hungry
world, must ``fight back tears'' as he mulls the vilification
leveled at him and the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel hurt, and we feel angry,'' he says. Not to mention
misunderstood, implies the New Yorker. Remember those Terminator
seeds, the ones engineered to die on the vine? Suicide seeds, we're
told, had ``the potential to address a worrisome environmental
issue'' making sure ``unwanted traits do not cross-pollinate and
spread to other species.''
</P>
<P>
   The foil to Shapiro's unappreciated corporate citizenship is
Lord Peter Melchett, organic farmer, Greenpeace activist and former
Labor Party minister.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Melchett, as he is referred to in the article _ an
honorific that conjures the despised powdered wigs of Rumpole of
the Bailey _ states that his opposition to genetically engineered
foods need not be based on scientific objections.
</P>
<P>
   ``People do things for all sorts of reasons that are rational,
but they are not scientific or technical,'' Melchett says. ``Why
does somebody buy a Rolls-Royce or a Mercedes? It's a box with four
wheels. But nobody says you are completely irrational to buy an
expensive car. If it's acceptable to choose your car based on
emotion and not science, why should it be wrong to choose your food
that way?''
</P>
<P>
   Marie Antoinette could not have said it better. M'lord
Greenpeace, it seems, cannot put himself in the shoes of the
starving masses who, after all, go around barefoot.
</P>
<P>
   Now I do believe much of the criticism of genetically engineered
foods has been ill-founded and occasionally Luddite, and that a
better treatment of biotechnology advocates, a better understanding
of gene-splicing techniques and a willingness to consider the
benefits of genetically engineered crops is in order.
</P>
<P>
   But I've also heard some very reasoned concerns raised by
ecologists like University of California at Berkeley professors
Miguel Altieri and Ignacio Chapela, as well as Marc Lappe, director
of the Center for Ethics and Toxics, located in Mendocino, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   I would summarize their arguments this way.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture is becoming increasingly industrialized, dominated
by heavy machinery and requiring large amounts of chemical
fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides, which are designed to mesh
with hybrid seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Gene-splicing techniques are only the latest, most far-reaching
example of this approach. Ecologists worry that this
agro-industrial gestalt threatens the web of microorganisms,
natural nutrients and topsoil on which all civilization depends.
</P>
<P>
   This growth zone has been 4 billion years in the making.
Perhaps, they say, we should consider the ecological effects of our
relatively recent practice of mixing tons of chemical agents into
the soil and devoting millions of acres to industrial growing
techniques that may produce quick yield improvements, but
eventually burn out the soil.
</P>
<P>
   I understand how that argument may have fallen out of the New
Yorker. They gave the piece only 12 pages, not room enough, it
seems, to explain the shades of gray.
</P>
<P>
   SHAMELESS PLUG: The Commonwealth Club of California will hold a
debate on ``The risks and benefits of genetically modified foods''
at 4:45 p.m. PDT Tuesday at 595 Market St. in San Francisco.
Presenting the pro side will be Dr. Martina McGloughlin, director
of the University of California at Davis biotechnology program. Dr.
Peter Rosset, executive director of Food First in Oakland, will
present the opposing view. I will moderate.

<P>
   WILD &AMP; WOOLY: Biotech stocks have taken investors for a
roller-coaster ride in recent weeks. Expect the wild gyrations to
continue.
</P>
<P>
   After a stunning climb that began in January, sparked by
optimism about new gene discoveries, the sector plunged in March,
thanks in part to confusion about whether President Clinton and
British Prime Minister Tony Blair were opposed to gene patents.
</P>
<P>
   Biotech stock indexes lost more than a third of their value in
March and, despite a brief uptick or two, seemed to be trending
slowly downward.
</P>
<P>
   Then last Wednesday, Clinton tried to repair the damage by
personally emphasizing that he had no objection to private gene
patents. The next day, Celera Genomics, one of the leaders in the
private gene discovery effort, announced another milestone in the
race to read the entire human genome.
</P>
<P>
   Biotech stocks started to bounce back faster than you could say
fuhgedaboutit. The Nasdaq biotech stock index, which tracks 200
firms, gained 8 percent last week. Even after a brutal March, the
index is ahead 27 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Strong stock gains and front page news often attracts novice
investors, like the person who asked me for the ticker symbol for
Celera. It's CRA, short, I should have mentioned, for Caution, Risk
Ahead.
</P>
<P>
   This is a fickle sector, driven up and down by news over which
the average investor has no control or even a clue. My colleague,
financial columnist Arthur Louis, helped me understand the
mathematics of biotech volatility.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poors index has a price-earnings ratio of 32. The
Nasdaq, heavily weighted with technology firms, has a PE of 211,
high but still positive. And it is notably more volatile than the
S&AMP;P.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq biotech stock index, by comparison, has a negative
PE. That's because most of the 200 firms in the index will lose
money, until and unless they get some drug through the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   So the conventional investment measures can't be applied to a
biotech portfolio. There are sound companies in the sector, but if
you throw money at biotech momentum players before you've done
enough homework to separate the wheat from the chaff, you'd better
expect to get blown about a bit.

 ONLINE BROKERS ATTEMPT PERFECT BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS MATCHES  &HT;     By CAROLYN SAID 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mike Brossier was drowning in excess olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   Critelli Olive Oil, where he is director of food service, had
listened to suggestions from its chef customers and crafted an oil
similar to that sold in Mediterranean countries: raw, unfiltered,
strongly flavored.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a deep green, cloudy olive oil that was a little
too daring for the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   That left the Richmond, Calif., plant sitting on 12,000 liters
of the oil. Plus 4,800 liters of another style that hadn't sold and
2,616 bottles of flavored oil from a canceled order. And the clock
was ticking on the shelf life.
</P>
<P>
   So last week, Brossier turned to the Internet and a
business-to-business exchange.
</P>
<P>
   He listed the oil on Rebound, an exchange for excess inventory
of finished consumer products.
</P>
<P>
   After five days, Critelli had inquiries from a retailer in South
Korea and a wholesaler in China, both countries where robust olive
oil is more accepted. No deal is set, but Brossier anticipates
getting offers soon; Rebound will get about a 6 percent commission.
</P>
<P>
   Brossier's story illustrates why B2B exchanges are this year's
Wall Street darlings, even though many could be next year's
has-beens. These online middlemen essentially overhaul supply
chains, trimming costs and time, and open up larger markets for
goods. Each exchange is a like an eBay devoted to a specific
market: car parts or factory equipment or plastics.
</P>
<P>
   Rebound has targeted a niche market _ excess inventory of
consumer goods _ and is leveraging contacts and knowledge gained
from its founders' brick-and-mortar experiences in that field. Like
many exchanges, the company said it strives to maintain the human
dimension; each customer works with an account manager, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   But the company also exemplifies the potential pitfalls for
exchanges. There's nothing to stop Brossier, or any other customer,
from taking his business across the virtual street to a rival. And
Rebound's foray into cyberspace is so new _ its official site
launch was just a month ago, although a beta version had been up
for over a year _ that it's too soon to gauge the profit potential.
</P>
<P>
   For all B2B exchanges, the potential market size is staggering.
A forthcoming report from research firm Keenan Vision of San
Francisco predicts that the dollar volume of B2B exchange
transactions will vault from $33.9 billion this year to $1.3
trillion in 2004. That's almost 12 percent of the U.S. GDP gross
domestic product, which the White House projects will be $10.9
trillion in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, those huge numbers reflect the entire pie of deals;
the exchanges only get a slice as a commission, plus bonuses if
they arrange ancillary services such as shipping and financing.
</P>
<P>
   And some huge corporations want to keep those slices for
themselves, instead of sharing with independent companies that set
up an exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The much-ballyhooed February deal among General Motors, Ford and
DaimlerChrysler to form an online marketplace for car parts means
they'll be their own middlemen. Retail giants Sears, Roebuck and
France's Carrefour &LR;   &LR; are starting an exchange for purchasing from
more than 50,000 suppliers. Chevron and Wal-Mart's McClane division
are teaming up to create an exchange for convenience stores. (All
those companies are partnering with technology firms such as Oracle
and CommerceOne, which will share in the riches.)
</P>
<P>
   Whether suppliers will be enthusiastic about exchanges run by
their customers remains to be seen. ``These e-marketplaces have to
learn the role of neutrality,'' said Bruce Temkin, research
director at Forrester Research. ``They have to figure out how to
make it work for not just them, but for their suppliers as well.
Otherwise, it will be just a bunch of big guys bullying up on their
supply chain.''
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, B2B exchanges replace informal _ and chaotic _
systems that rely heavily on buyers faxing orders, sellers calling
potential buyers, or salesmen hitting the road. ``We're not selling
anything new, just something more efficient,'' said Marybeth Dee,
president and co-founder of Rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Headquartered in both San Francisco and Hong Kong, Rebound helps
connect Asian and North American markets, particularly factories in
Asia seeking ways to sell overruns and discontinued goods.
</P>
<P>
   It deals with home and lifestyle products (for example, a
Chinese factory owner who was shutting down shop and desperately
needed to unload 42,000 10-piece knife sets of a brand very
familiar to infomercial fans), food (700,000 packages of frozen
teriyaki chicken wings), clothing and accessories (7,000
Teletubbies vinyl knapsacks), consumer electronics (100,000 laser
pointers) and computers (14 IBM ThinkPads, $1,102 each).
</P>
<P>
   B2B exchanges cut business costs in two ways. By creating a
broader, more open market, they can result in better prices for
products. And, more importantly to many firms, they can
dramatically slash procurement costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We focus on taking cost out of the channel,'' said Bob Flury,
executive vice president of Santa Clara, Calif.'s Neoforma, an
exchange for medical supplies ranging from bandages to radiology
machines.
</P>
<P>
   Flury quotes an industry study that hospitals, doctors and
nursing homes spend up to $15 billion annually in excess cost on
order entry, processing and logistics. Each individual order costs
$8 to $10 if made via fax, $5 to $6 via phone, $2 to $3 via
Electronic Data Interchange (a proprietary technology format used
by about one-fifth of the health care industry), and 50 cents or
less when made via the Internet, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If businesses save big bucks on supplies, what will it mean to
the average person?
</P>
<P>
   When a manufacturer pays less for steel for a Chicago skyscraper
or chemicals for lab tests, it's not going to affect Joe Consumer.
Even with goods further down the consumer chain _ produce, for
example, or the finished goods sold on Rebound _ you can't map a
direct impact at the checkout.
</P>
<P>
   But B2B proponents say consumers still win under the
trickle-down theory. ``When the supply chains get cheaper and
computer automation makes things more efficient, it enables
companies to maintain price stability,'' said Vernon Keenan,
president of Keenan Vision. ``It could introduce further restraint
on inflation in our economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of firms call themselves B2B exchanges, although many
aren't yet open for business. About two dozen B2B firms plan to go
public this year, and plenty more are in the pipeline. ``We get
five to 10 business plans for B2B exchanges on a daily basis,''
said Mark Hilderbrand, a partner at Onset Ventures, a Menlo Park
venture capital firm.
</P>
<P>
   So many exchanges means it's inevitable there will be a big
shakedown, soon.
</P>
<P>
   Neoforma, for example, competes against at least half a dozen
medical-supply exchanges. And Wall Street already seems soured on
the company's prospects. It went public at $13 in January, and
after soaring to $73.53 in February, plunged back to earth. It
closed at $14.13, down 38 cents, on Friday. Analysts said the stock
has been hammered by concerns over Neoforma's acquisitions and last
month's announcement that five of the biggest medical supply
companies, including Johnson &AMP; Johnson and GE Medical Systems, will
form their own online marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say ancillary services like financing, transportation
and insurance will be key to determining which B2B exchanges
survive.
</P>
<P>
   Most exchanges partner with outside vendors for these
value-added services.
</P>
<P>
   For example, IronPlanet, a Palo Alto, Calif., exchange in the
$28 billion market for used heavy construction equipment says it
has contracted with huge government contractor Dyncorp for
impartial inspectors who will personally examine each backhoe or
tractor at the seller's site, analyze oil samples from the engine
and transmission, and write a detailed report with pictures of each
moving part.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers who want to kick the tires themselves before laying out
more than $100,000 for a 4-year-old Caterpillar excavator can still
do so _ but those who don't can save on their airfare and time.
</P>
<P>
   IronPlanet also offers assistance with insurance,
transportation, financing, and parts and service.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Rebound has partnered with logistics, financial
services and quality assurance firms, and hopes to soon ink a deal
with freight forwarders.
</P>
<P>
   Keenan sees exchanges going to a model where they generate most
of their revenue from value-added services and cut out transaction
fees altogether.
</P>
<P>
   A Livermore, Calif., exchange for produce called
TradingProduce.com is already ahead of this wave. Last month, it
eliminated its transaction fee. Buyers and sellers pay a flat, $99
monthly fee to use the service, but its primary revenues come from
helping with logistics, financing and insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Gib Papazian, president of Lucky Strike Farms, a South San
Francisco, Calif., distributor, shipper and broker of vegetables
and melons, uses TradingProduce for about a tenth of his company's
annual $50 million in sales. He said the financing services were
particularly attractive. ``The accounting practices of large
customers have become aggressive and slow,'' he said.
TradingProduce is backed by giant agricultural bank Rabobank,
which, for a fee, will pay growers and brokers within 40 hours and
collect from the slow-paying stores or brokers who bought the
produce.
</P>
<P>
   Early mornings at a produce dealer's office are a blizzard of
faxes and phone calls, setting up deals to get hundreds of cases of
lettuce and artichokes from Salinas fields to the local Safeway,
for example.
</P>
<P>
   Papazian said TradingProduce gives him a streamlined, paperless
way to handle information bottlenecks. ``I can go ahead and flip on
the Internet and see what product is available,'' he said.
``Instead of dialing each individual grower and saying `Here's how
much of this or that I need packed up,' I just fill out an order on
the Internet and zip it over to them, and they zip the pickup
number back to me in 15 seconds, instead of five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are afraid it's going to replace human contact,''
he said. ``I look at it as the opposite; it's going to enhance
contact. You're spending less time doing rote, mechanical monkey
work and more time discussing how to improve things and tend to the
affairs of the firm.''

<P>
   YUGOSLAV-TRIBUNAL (The Hague, Netherlands) _ Confounding the
many critics who long called the international tribunal here a mere
fig leaf for Western shame, the court dealing with Yugoslav war
crimes has just completed an extraordinary month. It has opened the
first U.N. trial ever to focus exclusively on sexual violence
against women, such as gang rape and the use of women as sexual
slaves as part of war strategy. It has also begun the trial of one

shoots at them, the bullets just bounce off. And they can kill
their enemies simply by pointing a rifle at the ground and
concentrating really hard. It sounds like the fantasy of a million
schoolboys. But it is a belief that has led grown men into battle

ROUTINE MASTERY: SINGH ANSWERS EACH CHALLENGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Four days at Augusta National brought more
unfounded threats than lawyers in a divorce proceeding. Tiger,
Nicklaus, Duval, lightning, it all went out with the green trash
bags.
</P>
<P>
   What we were left with was the Unemotional Open.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks and weeks of Tiger Woods instigating gallery riots
and turning CBS into the Golf Channel II, we saw the Big Fiji beat
the Big Easy, the Incredible Shrinking Man and either Oral or Julia
Roberts in a pillow fight.
</P>
<P>
   Golf fans begged for another excitement fix. Vijay Singh Sunday
gave them routine and mundane instead, claiming the Masters with a
three-stroke victory.
</P>
<P>
   This might play at Sahalee, where Singh packed off the PGA
Championship trophy in similar fashion two years ago. Half of
Microsoft was there to cheer him on. But people here expect a
little swagger with their green jacket.
</P>
<P>
   Masters winners usually break down and cry. They single out
Augusta National as the ultimate golfing experience.
</P>
<P>
   The soft-spoken Singh said thank you. That's it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to think differently of (any) of the majors,'' he
said diplomatically. ``They're all really big tournaments and mean
the same to me. The Masters, PGA, British Open and U.S. Open,
they're all right there. I just hope one day I can finish the next
two.''
</P>
<P>
   Singh had people in their cars by the 13th hole, heading up the
interstate. His closest pursuer at the time, David Duval, put one
in the water at the back door of Amen Corner and it was over.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-year-old Fiji native shot 3-under-par 69 in the final
round, actually 3-under 85 over 22 holes Sunday, forced to finish
Saturday's weather-interrupted effort early in the morning. He
never trailed during any of it, though the lead shrank to one at
times.
</P>
<P>
   Singh finished with a 10-under 278 total, good for his ninth PGA
Tour victory and a paycheck worth $828,000 _ $228,000 more than he
wheelbarrowed out of Sahalee.
</P>
<P>
   With a couple of late birdies, South African Ernie ``Big Easy''
Els was runner-up, shooting 68 and 281. Duval and laid-back Loren
Roberts were tied for third, both at 282. Not exactly the makings
for a frat house party.
</P>
<P>
   Woods was fifth, at 284, unable to coax enough magic out of his
clubs after an opening-day 75.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still had a chance,'' the ever-confident Woods said. ``I'm
proud of that, the fact I got back in this tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people pined for Duval, the tour's fitness freak, to win.
He was one of them, a former Georgia Tech player, another man with
a slow, Southern drawl and true appreciation for these parts.
</P>
<P>
   He also came up with a fade instead of a draw on the 13th hole.
Splash. Trailing by a stroke, Duval's 5-iron shot from 196 yards
caught the creek that guards the right side of the 485-yard par 5.
Duval bogeyed and Singh birdied, and the split was three.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than commend Singh's good fortune, the gallery turned
eerily silent, tepidly applauding the man in front.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do we do now?'' one woman asked her husband, who pointed
to the parking lot. They were not alone in the exodus.
</P>
<P>
   So precise and error-free for much of the day, Duval had no
details to provide on what went wrong on the unlucky 13th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hit a poor golf shot and it was the wrong time to do
it,'' he said. ``It was the only one I had all weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Singh stayed close throughout the proceedings, trailing Dennis
Paulson by one shot after the first round, Duval by one after two
rounds and then easing himself in front during blustery conditions
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Singh let his putting lead him to a green jacket. His first
three-putt of the tournament came on his 57th hole. He had just two
at Augusta.
</P>
<P>
   ``He putted wonderful,'' Duval said. ``He putted more wonderful
than he played.''
</P>
<P>
   Singh goes by feel. He has 1,000 putters at home, and one is
never around long.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not an understatement,'' he said, referring to the
stockpile and exchange rate. ``I have a lot of putters. If it's not
working, you get something that will.''
</P>
<P>
   As a teen in Fiji, Singh used to catch the Masters on TV, on
tape delay. That's kind of what happened Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome was evident and much of the excitement was gone, but
he hung in there just the same.

M'S SMACK YANKEES TO CAP 4-2 HOMESTAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ After spending the better part of a week kicking sand
in the bullies' faces, the Mariners don't exactly own the beach.
</P>
<P>
   They do, however, own a sense that the bullies will give them a
wide berth after Seattle's completion of a 4-2 homestand against
Boston and New York. Sunday's 9-3 win over the Yankees gives the
Mariners as many wins against the Beasts of the East as they had in
all of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope everybody in the clubhouse realizes what we've done
here this week,'' right fielder Jay Buhner said. ``We went against
two of the best teams in baseball, and they threw their big boys at
us. We played well enough we could have won all six games, and we
did win four.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stunk against East Coast teams last year. But this is a
totally different team. We've got the pitching to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   One week into the season, Seattle has the best team earned-run
average in baseball at 2.83. That's a little like saying
Switzerland has the world's best Navy. It doesn't compute.
</P>
<P>
   But, said starting pitcher Jamie Moyer after his eight-inning,
three-run start chipped the Yankee bats into so much sawdust, maybe
it should compute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a team full of people who can pitch,'' Moyer said.
``I believe we've got really good arms here. On top of that, we've
played good defense. Everything we've done this first homestand has
been very, very positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's game was huge for the Mariners. A 3-3 homestand would
have been acceptable, given the M's 4-16 stroll over hot coals
against the Red Sox and Yankees a year ago. But a loss would have
meant back-to-back setbacks after Saturday's 3-2 heartbreaker.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees threw former Cy Young Award winner Roger Clemens at
Seattle Sunday. Clemens owns as many career wins against Seattle
(20) as any pitcher ever _ Dave Stewart also stung the Mariners 20
times.
</P>
<P>
   And whittling away at Clemens was as difficult as advertised.
The first four innings saw just one unearned Seattle run _ Mike
Cameron's infield single brought home the game's first run in the
third. But that was gone moments later when doubles by Chuck
Knoblauch and Derek Jeter led to two fourth-inning Yankee runs.
</P>
<P>
   But a throwing error by catcher Jorge Posada in the bottom of
the fifth helped Seattle to load the bases with no one out against
Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron's infield single off the glove of the leaping Knoblauch
brought the tying run home. Alex Rodriguez gave the M's the lead
with a grounder to second base. John Olerud added a sacrifice fly.
Edgar Martinez slipped a single between third and short for another
run.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, the Mariners kept taking pitches, fouling off
pitches and making Clemens work. Perhaps the best example of that
was Buhner, who worked and worked Clemens until he got a 3-2 pitch
he could juice. The ball, which came on Clemens' 32nd pitch of the
inning, landed five rows deep in the right-field bleachers for a
two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   Just like that, the upstart was in command, and the beach bully
was sullenly trying to find a way to get all that sand out of his
Speedos.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens is still a terrific pitcher, but he's 37 and, just
maybe, becoming vulnerable. He started 29 times last year, and the
Yankees only went 16-13 in those games.
</P>
<P>
   Buhner, for one, can see a chance for hitters to maybe get a
little revenge for all those nuclear third strikes Clemens used to
throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I shouldn't say this, but I think Roger's only got so
many fastballs and split-fingers left in him,'' Buhner said. ``We
kept working him hard, and I saw him going more to sliders and BP
(batting practice) fastballs, you know, 88 mph.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens needn't feel picked upon by the hurry-up-and-wait
Mariners. The Mariners have made a habit of getting deeper into the
game with virtually every pitcher they've faced this year. Seattle
hitters have one of the worst batting averages (.230) in the
league, but they've walked 31 times, tied for the best total in the
AL. Even the club's AL-worst 49 strikeouts have served a purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if there's ever such a thing as a good
strikeout,'' Rodriguez said. ``But we've gotten a lot of the
pitchers we've faced into high pitch counts. Even when we've struck
out, it's usually been on a 3-2 pitch, not just 1-2-3.''
</P>
<P>
   That's always been the Yankee way, but the Bronx bummers didn't
have a chance to try that with Moyer. The lefty didn't walk a
batter and was seldom behind in the count. As a consequence, the
Yankees only saw 93 of his pitches in eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was his stuff,'' Knoblauch said with a tip of his cap to
Moyer. ``He changes speeds, throws strikes. It just goes to show
you it doesn't matter how hard you throw _ you can be successful if
you change speeds and keep guys off the bases.''
</P>
<P>
   Moyer allowed just three base-runners. He retired 18 of the
final 19 batters he faced, and reliever Jose Paniagua set New York
down in order in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get the kind of pitching we're getting, it takes
pressure off the offense,'' Rodriguez said. ``When you go out there
feeling you have to score 10 or 12 runs to win, there's a tendency
to press. We scored nine today, but we know we don't have to score
nine every day to be competitive.''

REVAMPED BULLPEN GIVES MARINERS WHOLE NEW LOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Start spreading the news.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners have delivered on a promise: They can pitch.
</P>
<P>
   After a 24-year legacy of abusing the truth, not to mention the
strike zone, the local baseball club has started a season as it
said it would: A lot less Paul Bunyan-style hacking, and a lot more
Sheriff Andy Taylor-style whittling.
</P>
<P>
   Ask the New York Yankees, if you can find them in the pile of
wood chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is they can bring guys out of the bullpen,''
said Yankees manager Joe Torre, whose defending champs last year
beat the Mariners nine of 10 times, but lost two of three over the
weekend here. ``Their staff is stronger. Now a one- or two-run lead
is enough for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday the Mariners made it even easier, hanging a fifth-inning
six-spot on Roger Clemens to rout the Yanks 9-3. Only a single
inning from the bullpen was required, because starter Jamie Moyer
delivered an April gem of eight innings and 93 pitches, only three
of them returned as hits.
</P>
<P>
   That completed a 4-2 opening home-stand whose virtues can best
be understood by comparing it to the first six games of 1999 in the
Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners started out 3-3 against Chicago and Oakland but
gave up a spirit-crushing 42 runs. Remember Eric Weaver, Mac Suzuki
and Brett Hinchliffe?
</P>
<P>
   This season's opponent total: 18 runs, to the Yankees and Red
Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Only once in the first six games a year ago did the Mariners
give up fewer than three runs. In the first six games of 2000, they
gave up more than three runs only once. Mariners fans risk the
threat of injury from two-season whiplash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does wonders for your confidence, being in every game,''
said Jay Buhner, who put up a double and homer Sunday to lead the
Mariners with a .389 average. ``We could easily have been 6-0.
There's a lot of new guys here, guys who don't know what went on
here the last three or four years ... it's in the back of your
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The nightmare scratching at the underside of Buhner's shaven
skull has to do with going into the seventh inning with six runs
and knowing it wouldn't be enough.
</P>
<P>
   The bullpen has blown so many eighth and ninth innings for so
many seasons that there was some off-season rules-committee
discussion of renaming a bases-loaded walk ``the Mariner,'' because
the label was so concise and universally understood.
</P>
<P>
   The cure isn't complete _ witness Jose Mesa surrendering the
game-winning run in the ninth Saturday for New York's only series
win _ but with just five earned runs given up in 18{ innings by the
'pen, neither is reliable relief a mirage. As for the new relief
ace, Kazu Sasaki, only the dim outlines are visible of his imminent
largeness.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're serious, they have a pact going,'' Buhner said. ``You
can see they're going off on each other, picking each other up.''
</P>
<P>
   The history of repeated failures not only was hard on the
pitching staff, it wore acutely on the offense. Already prone to
overswinging, the lineup largely convinced itself that a five-run
homer was the only way out of most messes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot out of the offense knowing that you have to
keep tacking on runs,'' manager Lou Piniella said. ``Now, we can do
the little things, like bunt or hit and run. We don't need the big
inning. But we got one anyway, just doing the little things.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the decisive fifth, when a little Yankee screw-up on
the littlest play, a sacrifice bunt, led to much baseball bleeding.
Here's how the first four runs were produced: Soft single to
center, sac bunt and throwing error by catcher Jorge Posada, walk,
infield single for one run, run-scoring ground-out for a second
run, sacrifice fly for a third run, ground single to left for a
fourth run.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, who was seeking his 21st career win over the Mariners _
most by any opponent in club history _ instead was dripping from
multiple paper cuts. Buhner's subsequent reversion to the ancient
Mariners style, a two-run homer to close the scoring, was
superfluous.
</P>
<P>
   Buhner, the surprising early season offense leader while waiting
for others to defrost _ Edgar Martinez and Dan Wilson had their
first hits of the season Sunday, and John Olerud is batting .167 _
is getting a chuckle out of the transformation in ways more than
winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun to watch Lou,'' he said. ``He's really doing some
great things managing. We're running, using the hit-and-run, the
other day he was talking about a squeeze play.''
</P>
<P>
   While a successful opening week will be followed by inevitable
seasonal stumbles, the Mariners established that they did what they
set out to do _ transform a failing team to a new park and to
proven ways of winning.
</P>
<P>
   And thanks to the Seattle chill, the Mariners are hardened off
for nine days in the frostbelt of Detroit, Toronto and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   There must be some excuses somewhere. But at this early moment,
one must go to Cincinnati for them.
