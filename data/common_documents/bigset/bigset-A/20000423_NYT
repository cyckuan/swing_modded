Padres bump Astros in 10 innings
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Another game, another loss.
</P>
<P>
   The season is not yet a month old and the Astros have
experienced almost every imaginable way to lose.
</P>
<P>
   There have been blowouts and close calls, starting pitching
nightmares and bullpen breakdowns. And don't forget a near
no-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   They found another way Saturday afternoon _ extra innings.
</P>
<P>
   A botched pickoff attempt, a wild pitch and one misplaced
fastball were just a few of the factors that sent the Astros to
their fifth loss in six games, an 8-6 defeat to the San Diego
Padres in 10 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're getting tougher and tougher to lose as the days go on,
particularly at home,'' said manager Larry Dierker, whose team is
2-6 at Enron Field. ``We were just sloppy. The way things are going
now we can't afford to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros fell behind early, briefly took the lead and later
forced extra innings with a two-run rally in the sixth. Padres
catcher Carlos Hernandez, activated from the disabled list earlier
in the day, hit a two-run double off lefthander Yorkis Perez with
two out in the 10th inning to provide the winning runs.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of problems began long before.
</P>
<P>
   On the first pitch of the game, Al Martin doubled to left field.
He later scored. In the second inning, Astros starter Chris Holt,
who remained winless in four starts, threw away a ball on a pickoff
attempt, which eventually led to a run.
</P>
<P>
   A wild pitch by Holt in the third allowed Tony Gwynn to advance
from second to third; he scored a couple of pitches later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to play better,'' said first baseman Jeff Bagwell, who
homered for the sixth time in nine games. ``We have to pitch
better. We have to hit better. We have to play better defense. We
just have to be a better ballclub.''
</P>
<P>
   Holt allowed six runs and 10 hits in six innings but avoided his
fourth loss when Roger Cedeno tied the score at 6 with a two-out,
two-run single off Donne Wall in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Holt has allowed 26 earned runs, the most in the National
League. Opponents are hitting .409 against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not overly disappointed with my performance,'' Holt said.
``The ball I threw away at first and the wild pitch cost me. Those
are big parts of the game. You have to be able to make those plays.
It wasn't a bad game, but I wish we could have been on the winning
end of it. ``We're in a funk right now, but we're not going to stay
in this forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell's two-run homer off Matt Clement in the fifth cleared
the railroad tracks above the left-field seats and landed on
Crawford Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Caminiti hit his second homer of the season, a two-out,
two-run shot into the bullpen in right-center in the first inning,
and Craig Biggio extended his hitting streak to 13 games, one shy
of his career high. Cedeno was 2-for-3 with two RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   That was the extent of the offense (six hits Saturday), whose
members' pictures are now appearing on milk cartons in the Houston
area. San Diego pitchers combined for 14 strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros had runners in scoring position in the third inning
but came up empty when Richard Hidalgo struck out to end the
inning. With runners at first and second and one out in the
seventh, Martin's diving catch robbed Mitch Meluskey and prevented
the go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're playing like we are right now you usually aren't
getting any breaks,'' Biggio said.
</P>
<P>
   The longest bomb of the day was reserved for Padres first
baseman Ryan Klesko, who became the first player to clear the wall
in straightaway center field with a shot estimated at 440 feet.
</P>
<P>
   His sixth-inning home run gave the Padres a 6-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four-forty? I think it went a lot farther than that,'' San
Diego manager Bruce Bochy said. ``That ball would have gone out
anywhere.''

Baseball on its way to getting radical with realignment
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By ALAN TRUEX &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Three years ago, David Glass, CEO of the Kansas City Royals, issued
a blueprint for restructuring Major League Baseball. In the
interests of grouping everyone geographically, he would move nine
teams across league boundaries that had stood firm for almost a
century.
</P>
<P>
   The national media dubbed it ``radical realignment'' and
literally wrote it off as something that would never be imposed on
tradition-bound baseball. The Mets, Astros and Reds in the American
League? The White Sox and Athletics in the National?
</P>
<P>
   But as far-fetched as that proposal seemed, it drew support from
Bud Selig, the commissioner who has a knack for getting his way and
realigning the sport every three years or 50,000 miles, whichever
comes sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Selig reaches his goals slowly, one step at a time, never
letting the owners vote on anything until he's sure they're ready
to agree. After baseball's owners met last week in Houston, Selig
has more lobbying to do between now and June before he seeks
enactment of what he terms ``modest realignment'' for 2001.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, calling this realignment ``modest'' is like saying
Shiloh was a skirmish. In the reshuffling Selig proposed, the wild
card will be withdrawn from the National League, which will
introduce a new division, the Southeast, which, geography
notwithstanding, somehow will include Cincinnati, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The composition of all six currently existing divisions will
change, and two teams (Arizona, Tampa Bay) will switch leagues.
</P>
<P>
   But that's far from enough to satisfy Selig.
</P>
<P>
   When his master plan is completed, baseball will be reorganized
regionally, with a centralized format like that of the National
Basketball Association and National Hockey League. If the National
and American leagues continue to exist, they will bear little
resemblance to their appearance today.
</P>
<P>
   Selig took a major step toward centralization by abolishing the
National and American League offices. Last year, he dismissed NL
president Leonard Coleman and AL president Gene Budig.
Surprisingly, that shakeup did not elicit much outcry from media,
fans or baseball owners and executives.
</P>
<P>
   Tal Smith, president of the Astros, said, ``I don't think it's
had any real effect on anything. The main things the league
presidents dealt with were supervising the umpires and performing
some disciplinary functions.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said that with interleague play, ``It doesn't make sense
to have a perception that there's a difference in umpiring between
the two leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   But of course, the more the two leagues become the same, the
less radical it seems to abolish them altogether. Even so, Smith
and Astros owner Drayton McLane want to see the leagues holding
onto some vestiges of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you abolish the league delineations,'' Smith said, ``I
think that initially would bother a lot of fans. More than other
sports, baseball has depended on its history, its records and
traditions as part of its appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   But is that changing?
</P>
<P>
   Royals president Mike Hermann believes the leagues no longer
have any real meaning and that fans are becoming increasingly
ambivalent about league identification.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think our fans identify us that much as an American
League team,'' he said. ``There's not as much sensitivity to league
affiliation as there was in the 1950s and '60s.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith has found that among younger fans, ``there may not be as
much sensitivity about traditional league alignments as you get
from people who have been in the game a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Hermann pointed out that in the past decade, expansions,
realignments and the arrival of interleague play blurred
distinctions between the leagues, as did the recent turn to
standardized umpiring.
</P>
<P>
   And with widespread free agency, which began in the 1970s,
players continually bolt from team to team and league to league.
Many fans who preferred the AL because Ken Griffey Jr. was in it
may change allegiance with Griffey now playing for Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   However, one significant distinction that remains is the
designated hitter for the AL. If the two leagues become one, the DH
would be an all-or-nothing proposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd have to work something out with the players' union,''
Hermann said. ``If the DH went away, it wouldn't be the worst thing
to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is not the position of the Players Association, which
has the right to veto all of the Selig/Glass remodeling plans. The
union has refused to drop the DH, even when Major League Baseball
has offered to add a 26th roster position, thus creating a net gain
of union members.
</P>
<P>
   As the union sees it _ and also the owners, for that matter _
the DH is a high-salaried position that boosts the salaries of
other players.
</P>
<P>
   So why, with all the obstacles and objections to radical
realignment, does Selig push it, albeit gently?
</P>
<P>
   Foremost, he wants to promote rivalries, the lifeblood of any
team sport. He speaks nostalgically of baseball's most glorious
era, the 1940s and '50s, when the Brooklyn Dodgers and neighboring
New York Giants battled head-to-head throughout the National League
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   And there are other reasons for radical realignment besides
rivalry-making. Nobody faults Selig for trying to change a system
that has teams playing half their games during hours that bring
reduced television ratings and out-of-prime-time advertising rates.
</P>
<P>
   Selig and Glass hope they can raise the competitiveness of
small-market clubs with realignment along regional lines, combined
with an ``unbalanced'' schedule offering teams more games against
their nearby rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees and Los Angeles Dodgers can attract
near-capacity crowds regardless of the opponent, but that cannot be
said of small-market teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll never have the competitive balance we once had,'' Glass
said. ``But I think all the owners are ready to take steps to
narrow the gap, so small-market teams at least have a shot at
postseason play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Royals draw well when hosting Midwestern teams. ``A lot of
people who live in our town come from Chicago and St. Louis,''
Hermann said. ``They don't come from Seattle and Anaheim. West
Coast people tend to stay on the West Coast and Midwest people in
the Midwest when they change jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Chicago and St. Louis come into our town, they draw much
better than Anaheim and Seattle. And when we go out there, we don't
draw well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Glass plan of 1997 had the National League composed of
mostly western cities, with the American League composed of eastern
teams.
</P>
<P>
   Under this format, Hermann said, ``fans would see the teams they
want to see, and games won't be starting at 11 o'clock. You'd have
more interleague games, but you'd have a core of geographic games
like we have in other sports.''
</P>
<P>
   But others dispute the allure of regional matchups.
</P>
<P>
   When Glass tried to group all the Pacific teams together, he met
opposition in San Francisco and Los Angeles. Owners were unwilling
to exchange games with the storied Yankees and Boston Red Sox for
more dates with far-less-glamorous teams down the block _ Oakland
or San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   George Burks, a Houston attorney who spent many of his boyhood
hours in Brooklyn's Ebbets Field, questions whether Selig is on the
right track with radical realignment: ``You're talking about
overturning a lot of tradition, to try to get that kind of great
rivalry that can't happen again anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Giants came into Brooklyn, you'd have fisticuffs if
you were in the wrong section of the stands. Everybody lived
baseball. In the '50s you could go to ballgames or the movies or
watch black-and-white television on a miniscule screen. Now the
entertainment dollar is so much more diffused.''
</P>
<P>
   And with travel becoming ever faster and cable and satellite
television channels multiplying, Americans are not as regionalist
as they once were. While leagues may be losing significance, so is
distance.
</P>
<P>
   Midwesterners may tend to stay in the Midwest, as Hermann
suggests, but migration to the West and Sun Belt during the past
two decades suggests a weakening of geographical ties.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, there seems little demand for radical realignment or
geographic purity. Although this city is hardly a bedrock of
baseball tradition, it does maintain National League roots back to
the Houston Buffs, once a farm club of the St. Louis Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, fans here protested vigorously when McLane
indicated willingness in 1997 to change leagues.
</P>
<P>
   McLane desperately wanted the Astros in regular-season games
with the Texas Rangers, and he's likely to see his wish fulfilled
next season. But his hopes for an intrastate rivalry depend on both
teams being contenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the best rivalries in sports have nothing to do with
geography,'' Smith observed. ``Look at the Oilers and Pittsburgh
Steelers, or the (Los Angeles) Lakers and (Chicago) Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``And even though Philadelphia is geographically close to the
New York Mets, I wouldn't call that a great rivalry. I think
rivalries are created by who your competition is.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith isn't sure baseball helps itself with its frequent
makeovers. ``Personally, I'd like to see the divisions stay the
same for a while and let the rivalries develop,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you need is an unbalanced schedule so teams are playing a
lot of games against their division rivals in September. But to get
that, you need divisions with an even number of teams.''
</P>
<P>
   He likes the proposed wild-cardless National League realignment
for 2001, which has four divisions of four teams each. But the AL
does not set up so neatly, with its 14 teams to be dispersed in two
divisions of four and one of six.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideally, you'd like to add two teams to get 32,'' Smith said.
``But with some troubled franchises now, expansion is not on the
horizon. I think there's more chance of contraction than
expansion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota Twins are practically on life support, as were the
Montreal Expos before a recent change of ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Smith does not consider Minnesota and Montreal historical
anomalies. ``We've had franchises before that almost failed _ such
as San Diego and San Francisco _ and somebody always stepped up,''
he said. ``But I'm not sure that will keep happening.''
</P>
<P>
   With teams coming and perhaps going, it may be impossible to
develop the structural stability to promote the rivalries everyone
wants. But count on Selig to keep trying.
</P>
<P>
   The 2001 realignment will be the third for baseball in eight
years. By advancing his agenda gradually, Selig can make radical
realignment seem not radical at all. And sooner than you expect, it
may be done.

Spurs set game back a few years
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By FRAN BLINEBURY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Tim Duncan has a bad left knee. But it was the
rest of the Spurs who appeared lame.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Elliott has a transplanted kidney. But what the remaining
Spurs needed Saturday was a better shooting eye and a functioning
brain.
</P>
<P>
   Back-to-back? Or flat-on-their-backs?
</P>
<P>
   Defending champs? Or defending chumps?
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs opened the NBA 2000 new millennium playoffs with an
effort straight out of the Dark Ages. All that was missing was
garbage in the streets and the bubonic plague.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can do better,'' David Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Which is what the marketing geniuses at the baseball game said
the day after Roseanne sang the national anthem. This was just as
off-key.
</P>
<P>
   The official conclusion came when Mario Elie drifted a lazy pass
out toward the middle of the floor to Samaki Walker with 0.7
seconds left to play and it was intercepted by Rodney Rogers to
wrap up Phoenix's 72-70 win. But the end could have come any time
earlier in the afternoon when the Spurs looked ready or able to
compete.
</P>
<P>
   It was a day when the definition of ugly was stretched to new
limits. Missed layups. Errant free throws. Mindless passes. And
that was by the winners.
</P>
<P>
   Don't even bother to look at the final score and leap to any
conclusions about great defense. This equaled the lowest combined
score by two teams in a playoff game since the inception of the
shot clock only because of offensive ineptitude.
</P>
<P>
   How did they reach playoffs?
</P>
<P>
   Artistically, it was the equivalent of two teams tossing
elephant dung onto a canvas and trying to pass it off as a
masterpiece. It was hard to believe each team won 53 regular-season
games.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns struggled and the Spurs labored. Phoenix's Cliff
Robinson misfired at 6-for-18 shooting. The Spurs' David Robinson
was lucky he didn't hurt himself at 3-for-12.
</P>
<P>
   ``David was slowed in the first half by other factors,'' said
Spurs coach Gregg Popovich.
</P>
<P>
   He was talking about the officiating, which saddled The Admiral
with two personal fouls in the first quarter and a third with 5:09
left in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But long before that, Robinson appeared to have taken himself
out of the game, allowing the less-than-bullish Luc Longley to push
him around at one end of the floor and settling far too often for
jump shots at the other end.
</P>
<P>
   On the rare occasion when Robinson demanded the ball in the
paint, turned and powered to the hoop, he scored or drew a foul.
But he did it infrequently.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs shot a horrid 27-of-73 (37 percent) from the field by
relying on the likes of Terry Porter (2-for-7), Mario Elie
(0-for-5) and Malik Rose (3-for-8) to take too many of them.
</P>
<P>
   But they always had a chance because the Suns were miserable on
offense, connecting at 36.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If you put Elie together with the Suns' Randy Livingston
(1-for-6), the ex-Rockets factor had a large hand in the game
plummeting to new depths.
</P>
<P>
   It was a game when Popovich did not appear to distinguish
himself with a pair of curious personnel decisions in the fourth
quarter. First, he took Walker, his best rebounder on the day with
16, out of the game with just under nine minutes to play, and
Popovich also went the first 7{ minutes of the fourth quarter with
Antonio Daniels at point guard instead of quarterback Avery
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``That team was playing well,'' Popovich said.
</P>
<P>
   Everything, of course, being relative.
</P>
<P>
   Even coach had bad day
</P>
<P>
   With David Robinson frustrated by his foul situation and Elliott
retreating into a fourth-quarter shell in terms of taking shots,
the Spurs went through a crucial stretch where they left the
offense in the hands of Porter and Daniels. For nearly five minutes
of the final period, Porter and Daniels combined to miss five of
six shots and committed two turnovers; no other Spur got a look at
the basket.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the last eight seconds, Elliott passed up an open trey
to drive, only to put up an airball.
</P>
<P>
   It was reminiscent of the line by the old basketball coach when
asked about his team's execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in favor of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This season has not been without its challenges,'' David
Robinson said. ``This is just another one.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the talk will turn to Duncan and whether he can return for
Tuesday's Game 2. Just the thought shows the Spurs' dire straits.
</P>
<P>
   In the history of the best-of-five first round, the winner of
Game 1 has gone on to take the series 83 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a math major,'' Robinson said. ``And that 17 percent is
a lot bigger than you think.''
</P>
<P>
   The defending champs or defending chumps are already playing the
numbers game.

Suns manage ragged victory over Spurs
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By MICHAEL MURPHY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SAN ANTONIO _ With the defending champions in the house, Saturday's
game between the San Antonio Spurs and the Phoenix Suns was
supposed to be one of the day's marquee matchups.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it looked like the off-Broadway production of the 2000
NBA playoffs, with stand-ins doing much of the work for the lead
characters. No Tim Duncan, no Jason Kidd and no Tom Gugliotta.
</P>
<P>
   And not much of a game, as it turned out, because most of the
stand-ins took that meaning literally, mostly inert on offense and
defense. But because somebody had to win, the Suns managed to steal
the first game of the NBA Western Conference opener 72-70 before
21,916 at the Alamodome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we play San Antonio it's been like this,'' said
Phoenix coach Scott Skiles of the less-than-artistic game. ``It's
always low-scoring and everybody seems to shoot in the 40s
(percentage-wise). It's very ugly, but very exciting basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Exciting? Well, the game did come down to the last play, which
must constitute excitement of some kind.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, San Antonio had one last try at a tie (or a win), down
by two points with seven-tenths of a second left and the ball out
of bounds at midcourt. But, in keeping with the shoddy nature of
the game, Mario Elie's pass was picked off by Rodney Rogers,
leaving the Spurs on the short end of the game and the series,
which continues here Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we would have lost that game in the last second, I would
have cried,'' said the Suns' Corie Blount. ``I have never cried
about basketball in my life, but if we would have lost this one
tonight, that would have been the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Blount didn't have to, because the Spurs were doing plenty of
crying for both teams. The cried about the officiating, they cried
about the physical nature of the Suns' inside players and they
cried about missing Duncan, who was on the sidelines with torn
cartilage in his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   But the Suns aren't the healthiest team, either. Without Kidd
and Gugliotta, both starters, they've had to scramble, too, even
luring longtime Sun Kevin Johnson out of retirement. Penny Hardaway
(17 points) and Cliff Robinson (17 points) did their jobs, but it
was Johnson (six assists in 25 minutes) and Blount (five points,
six rebounds) who contributed as the Suns made the plays down the
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the case with the Spurs, who never seemed to find
any kind of rhythm (18 turnovers) or shooting eye (game tied
playoff record for fewest points).
</P>
<P>
   ``Our offense, the execution just wasn't there,'' Elie said.
``This was a very frustrating loss.''
</P>
<P>
   All the more frustrating because the Spurs could have won. With
eight seconds remaining, Sean Elliott found himself with the ball
in his hands and a chance to reprise his role as hero from last
season. Instead, Elliott saw his last jumper _ a leaning 11-footer
_ fall a foot short, giving the Suns the ball with a second left.
</P>
<P>
   But Elliott, who split the Suns' Cliff Robinson and Kevin
Johnson on the play, appeared to be smacked on the head by
Robinson, causing his shot to fall short.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I wouldn't say he smacked me,'' said Elliott, who
finished with 15 points on 6-of-14 shooting. ``Let's say he grazed
my head. But I just missed the shot. I give credit to Cliff
Robinson. He made me change the shot a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the Spurs' 37 percent shooting, the Suns, who are
less-than-noteworthy on defense, made them change a lot of shots.
And nowhere was that more evident than inside.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs did not have Duncan, sidelined with torn cartilage in
his left knee. But the Spurs knew beforehand they would be minus
one of their twin towers.
</P>
<P>
   What they didn't realize was they would be without both for much
of the game. Or so it seemed, as David Robinson struggled through
one of the worst playoff games of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, relying mostly on outside jumpers, made just three of
12 shots while playing against the likes of Blount, Luc Longley and
Oliver Miller, none of whom will be confused with Hakeem Olajuwon
defensively.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether Robinson, who finished with 11 points and 11
rebounds, was bothered by soreness in his right knee, San Antonio
coach Gregg Popovich said: ``No, David's fine. He was slowed
tonight by other factors.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked to elaborate, Popovich forced a smile and said:
``You'll just have to read my mind on that one. And that shouldn't
be too tough. I'm a pretty simple guy.''
</P>
<P>
   And Robinson had a simple explanation _ officiating. Robinson
was called for three fouls in his 10 first-half minutes, and he
didn't like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only playing eight or 10 minutes in that first half is kind of
tough,'' Robinson said. ``You go back in the second half and it's
hard _ you want to get things rolling pretty quick. But I'm going
to have to make some adjustments in the next game and play a little
better.''
</P>
<P>
   He can watch tapes of Samaki Walker, who tore up the Suns with
13 points, 16 rebounds and three blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   But this wasn't a game for the stars, was it?

Little nostalgia for Enron Field
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DALE ROBERTSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We used to speak fondly of the Astros' Dome-field advantage,
although it never really was much of one, translating into only two
division titles over 32 mostly mediocre seasons _ and far more
empty seats than occupied ones.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, it wasn't until the decision came down to replace the
Astrodome that the home team went from being peasants to pheasants
under glass. The Astros were 3-for-3 in Central Division titles
after the referendum to build Enron Field passed.
</P>
<P>
   So please excuse them if they're feeling pangs of nostalgia for
their dark and gloomy erstwhile house of pain. Because once again
Saturday, there would be nothing friendly about the cozy confines
of Home-ron Field. Fortunately, the multitude of fans, crammed into
every nook and cranny of the old-fashioned new park, appear to be
having so much darned fun visiting the Astros' new digs that
they've hardly noticed the hole their heroes are digging for
themselves on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Another SRO crowd, another sorrowful performance against a
second-tier ballclub. If the Astros can't beat the Phillies and the
Padres here, what chance do they have?
</P>
<P>
   That's not a trick question.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just got to play better baseball,'' said Jeff Bagwell,
although he is personally blameless with six home runs and 16 RBIs
on the season. ``We need a better team effort.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears the Astros don't have to win to sell tickets for the
near term, but the few purists among the throngs pouring downtown
are grumbling, as they should be. It's not a pitcher-perfect
setting, to be sure, but the inviting fences haven't stopped San
Diego from holding the Astros to just a pair of runs Friday night,
then to six paltry hits Saturday in an 8-6 extra-inning victory.
</P>
<P>
   Six runs used to mean something down on Kirby Drive. On Crawford
Street, six runs will only get you beat. Fact: After eight games,
six of them Astros losses, the bad guys are averaging 6.25 per. If
the so-called Gas House is going to be a hitter's park, which seems
a foregone conclusion with the roof open, then the Astros had best
stop taking the gas at the plate and get with the program
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Their National League-worst .228 batting average is more of a
drag than their NL-worse 5.81 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``These days, with these new parks,'' Bagwell said, ``you've got
to score runs to give yourself a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   And surely the Astros will. As Baggy was quick to point out,
cleanup hitter Ken Caminiti is no more than ``75 to 80 percent''
with his strained hamstring and Moises Alou, limping with a calf
injury, hadn't played in five games before he struck out pinch
hitting to end Saturday's sad affair. Once they start
sweet-stroking, and assuming center fielder Roger Cedeno finally
has found his swing, the Astros should glean as much pleasure from
the funky ball yard as their customers.
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno, the amazin' young Met turned dismayin' Astro, jacked his
average up 26 points on the afternoon _ to .196 _ with a single, a
double and two walks in five plate appearances. The aforementioned
single banged off the right-field fence, too, driving in the two
tying runs in the sixth inning and increasing his RBI count to five
for the season.
</P>
<P>
   He also would steal four bases, tying the club's record and
equaling his personally most larcenous day in New York, where he
pilfered a gaudy 66 in 1999. For one 3{-hour interlude at least,
Mike Hampton wouldn't be missed, especially the control-challenged
Mike Hampton the Mets have seen.
</P>
<P>
   It was beginning to be feared Cedeno didn't fit in as a new-age
Astro, that he arrived in Houston a year too late. But perhaps he
gave us a reason to keep our minds open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to run,'' manager Larry Dierker said, ``and Roger can
run.''
</P>
<P>
   Assuming he gets on base.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the total Enron experience, Astros pitchers will prove
a much harder sell, of course. But they would be wise to stop
fighting the problem. Hey, fellas, you're stuck. The boss, Drayton
McLane Jr., signed a 30-year lease, you know.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chris Holt was the latest victim, giving up six more
earned runs and 10 hits over six innings, he isn't necessarily
suffering from an edifice complex. Remember, he gave up 10 runs and
12 hits in three innings in San Diego. The Padres are batting .512
against Holt, as in jolt. And he had problems throwing accurately
to everybody, not just catcher Tony Eusebio, as an errant toss on
an attempted pickoff at first also set up a San Diego run.
</P>
<P>
   Last year he was the hard-luck kid. This year he has simply
turned into his own worst enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, Chris isn't pitching with a lot of confidence right
now,'' Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are many of his teammates bubbling over with same.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell was asked what needs to happen for the Astros to get
things pointed in the right direction before the Cardinals start to
vanish from their radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see Ellie (Scott Elarton) pitch a shutout
(today),'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   Fat chance. Considering there have been 29 home runs in the
park's first eight games, Elarton probably wishes he was making his
2000 debut in a safer place. Say Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get back to where we're excited about coming home
to play,'' Dierker said. ``Like other teams.'' &QL;

TRUTH HURTS IN NHL, SO YOU LIE A LOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ken Hitchcock was telling blatant lies late Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Except ...
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not. Maybe Hitchcock's words and his intention were as
pure as the driven slush, which passes these days for Reunion ice.
</P>
<P>
   Except ...
</P>
<P>
   In the wacky world of the NHL playoffs, there is no such thing
as a blatant lie, even if you repeatedly tell a whopper. No coach
or general manager in his right mind would actually speak the truth
about his team's injuries.
</P>
<P>
   So there was a relieved Hitchcock, mere minutes after his Dallas
Stars had ousted Edmonton in the first postseason series, standing
on the media room podium talking about how two very valuable team
components, Sergei Zubov and Jere Lehtinen,
might-be-could-be-definitely-will-be ready to play in Round Two.
Except ...
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said the same things about Zubov and Lehtinen before
and during the Edmonton series. Neither, of course, came close to
putting one blade on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   But Hitchcock rushed Friday night to get the word out fast to
both Colorado and San Jose. One of these clubs will show up at
Reunion this week for Game 1 of the Western Conference semifinals.
The Stars' coach wanted those opponents to have an immediate
mind-set, not to mention an extensive scouting report, which must
account for the return of two big horses to the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Is Hitchcock lying? Absolutely not, at least under the
long-standing NHL definition. This stuff is called important
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also called survival,'' Stars broadcaster Daryl Reaugh,
the former NHL goalie, noted. ``On injuries, you always want the
other side to wonder, and you do so by spewing as much
misinformation as you can.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the playoffs arrive, all injured players will be listed
as day-to-day. A guy can have an arm severed, but the club will
tell you the arm has been frozen and will be reattached. So he's
still day-to-day.''
</P>
<P>
   With Zubov and Lehtinen, however, it goes far beyond this
accepted gamesmanship. Logic says the Stars will not repeat as
Stanley Cup champs without at least Zubov being back to 100 percent
and being his usual valuable self in all areas. And when it comes
to valuable, the long-standing theory says Lehtinen is the team
MVP. The Stars made do during the regular season and in the first
round without him, but the grueling grind of the playoffs has only
just begun. No Lehtinen might well mean no Cup.
</P>
<P>
   For those guessing along, the popular notion says Zubov's knee
has improved and he will play in the next round, but Lehtinen's
ankle remains a mess and he's out for the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   And if you don't believe that, then go ask Hitchcock or Bob
Gainey. Just be sure to take along Judge Judy and a Bible. Sworn
testimony will be needed.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere else in professional sports, certainly not among the Big
Four, is such deceit about injuries either allowed or practiced.
</P>
<P>
   In the NFL, it's flat outlawed. The hiding of injuries can cost
a team tens of thousands of dollars in fines. The league office has
to be strict because so much money is wagered, legally and
illegally, on NFL games. Any perception of ``inside information''
being available on injuries would lead to a credibility disaster or
a scandal. Yet, even with the league being diligent and strict in
this area, there's always a question about some wiseguys still
having that inside info on injuries.
</P>
<P>
   In baseball and in the NBA, roster numbers are frozen, as
opposed to the ``healthy'' or ``injured'' pregame scratches in the
NHL. If a player is injured, it benefits a team in baseball or the
NBA to place him on the disabled list and bring in a healthy body.
In most cases, the hiding of injuries would be detrimental in those
sports.
</P>
<P>
   But the physical demands of hockey, combined with the toughness
of hockey players, also puts injuries in a different category from
all sports except maybe football.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NFL is the closest, but I don't know if football players
go to the extremes that hockey players do when it comes to injuries
this time of year,'' Reaugh said. ``The code is that you do not
hurt in the playoffs. You may be injured, but you do not hurt. No
matter what's ailing, or what body part may be about to fall off,
don't explain, don't complain. Just press on.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaugh's rule of thumb for the playoffs is this:
</P>
<P>
   ``The more pain your team has, that usually equates to more
wins. I don't know if anyone has ever done a survey, but I'd say
there are more off-season surgeries by the Stanley Cup champion
than any other team. Sure, that club played more games, but what I
think it means is the champion had more players able to play
through the pain.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes, however, to finding out the truth about those
injuries, don't expect any George Washingtons to step forward. nn

TOP SPRINTER JOHNSON STARTS FAST, CUTS BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDY FRIEDLANDER 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Johnson's month in Africa told him all he needed to know
about his readiness for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   In three spectacular performances at a series of meets in South
Africa, the world's most dominant sprinter put up
gold-medal-caliber times in his specialties, the 200 and 400
meters, and threw in a world record at the rarely-run distance of
300 meters. As a result, Johnson pulled out ofthe Michael Johnson
Open on Saturday in Waco, the meet at which he usually makes his
season debut in America, and has reduced his competitive schedule
for the season to a bare minimum.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson will run a 4x400 relay at next weekend's Penn Relays in
Philadelphia because of commitments to his major sponsor, Nike. But
he is likely to run just one more race between then and the Olympic
trials in July, said his coach, Clyde Hart.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to get back into training and reload,'' Hart said.
``Remember, what he did (in South Africa) was before he really got
into his training. He hadn't done any speed work. He went over
there to test himself, and I think he showed everyone where he
is.''
</P>
<P>
   That's at the top of the world, as usual. His time of 19.71
seconds in the 200 ranks No. 1 in the world, and his 43.9 in the
400 would if it hadn't been hand-timed due to a failure in the
automatic timing system. Obviously in top form, Johnson will now
trade competition for more training for the Games this September in
Sydney, Australia, where he hopes to repeat his unprecedented
200-400 double of 1996. He has also said he will attempt to lower
the 400 world record, which he set with a 43.18 last year, to less
than 43 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that's not the only reason for Johnson's limited
schedule. His wife, Kerry, is expecting a baby in early May. The
fewer meets on his schedule, the more time Johnson has with his
wife and child. TRACK IN `VOGUE' Track and field may be in vogue
because it's an Olympic year, but this month women's track and
field is really in ``Vogue''. High jumper Amy Acuff, pole vaulter
Stacy Dragila and sprinter Marion Jones are among a group of
Olympic hopefuls featured in the May issue of the fashion magazine.
Acuff, a professional model as well as a 1996 Olympian, is pictured
clearing a high jump bar in a Donna Karan aqua-mint silk chiffon
dress. She also appears in the April 17 issue of ``Us Weekly''.
</P>
<P>
   Dragila is just as hot in media circles. The 29-year-old former
heptathlete, who has broken the world indoor record and tied the
outdoor record in the past six months, is the star of a Visa
commercial in which she speaks dreamily of winning Olympic gold as
a diver before breaking the spell by revealing she's a pole vaulter
and admitting, ``I can't even swim.'' The women's pole vault will
be an Olympic event for the first time this year.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who is seeking a record five gold medals in Sydney, has
been more visible on the track than on television. She opened her
season last week with a stunning 49.59 in the 400 meters at the Mt.
SAC Relays in Walnut, Calif., easily the fastest time in the world
this year and the fourth-fastest ever by an American woman.
</P>
<P>
   Jones only ran the 400 because one of the five events in which
she hopes to compete at the Games is the 4x400 relay. She is also
chasing gold in the long jump and the 4x100 relay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to send a message to the U.S. relay coaches that if
they need somebody to run a 400 leg, I'm ready,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, Jones' husband, world champion shot putter C.J.
Hunter, won his event at Mt. SAC with a throw of 71-4. BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Sprinter John Capel withdrew from the University of Florida
last week to concentrate on preparing for the Olympic trials. As a
freshman, Capel won the 1999 NCAA outdoor 200 title in 19.87,
faster than any American other than Johnson in the past 12 months,
and has run a 10.03 100 meters.
</P>
<P>
   _ Former TCU star Bryan Howard posted the first sub-10-second
100 of his career with a slightly wind-aided 9.94 at Mt. SAC.
Howard finished a close second to Olympian Mike Marsh at 9.90.

<P>
   GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas _ Victory celebrations usually are quenched
by champagne. But Ralph Ziadie shares the tastes of one of the
horses he trains, so the bubbly could wait after he won both the
$300,000 Lone Star Derby and the $300,000 Texas Mile on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Ziadie, what would you like (to drink),'' Lone Star media
relations director Darren Rogers asked after the victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bottled water,'' Ziadie replied.
</P>
<P>
   Bottled water didn't work for Skip Away when he raced in the
Texas Mile in 1997. But bottled water is the only thing Sir Bear
drinks when he's away from his barn in Florida. It was the proper
fuel at Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie as Sir Bear capped off the
biggest day in the professional life of Ziadie and jockey Eibar
Coa.
</P>
<P>
   Ziadie, a native of Jamaica who is based in Florida, first made
it to the winner's circle when Coa rode Tahkodha Hills past Jeblar
Sez Who by almost a length in the stretch of the Lone Star Derby.
About 45 minutes later, Coa had Sir Bear a nose in front of long
shot Lexington Park to win the Grade III Texas Mile in front of a
crowd of 16,119.
</P>
<P>
   First place for both races pays $165,000 to the owners of each
horse. Both Ziadie and Coa get about a 10 percent cut of that, more
than $30,000 each. Ziadie's in line for a bonus of $250,000 if
Tahkodha Hills wins any of the Triple Crown races. It's part of the
$1 million bonus that Lone Star has underwritten (the winning owner
gets $750,000, and the jockey receives a payment from the owner).
</P>
<P>
   Ziadie said he's definitely interested in trying to collect. He
won't race Tahkodha Hills in the Kentucky Derby in two weeks. He
said the Preakness on May 20 is a possibility, but he said it's
more likely he'd run in the Illinois Derby at Sportsman's Park near
Chicago on May 13. That would set him up for the Belmont Stakes on
June 10, and Ziadie and Tahkodha Hills' owner, Vernon Heath, think
that might be their best shot at the payday.
</P>
<P>
   ``With that amount of bonus potential, we'll surely go ahead to
one of the Triple Crown races,'' Heath said.
</P>
<P>
   He has a horse that suddenly has developed into a more versatile
runner instead of a one-dimensional closer. In his previous three
appearances in stakes races, Tahkodha Hills was never closer than
sixth at the midway point of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Through the first half of the 11/16-mile Derby, Coa had Tahkodha
Hills laying third. Judging by the first week of racing at Lone
Star, a deep-closing style wouldn't work on this track.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's right,'' Coa said. ``And I knew today that there was no
speed, so I knew I had to be close. He had good position, and
everything worked out right.''
</P>
<P>
   Odds-on favorite Big Numbers was third.
</P>
<P>
   There was no need to change the way Sir Bear has been running.
He was the only millionaire in the field of the Mile, but there was
a question if the 7-year-old had seen his best days. He hadn't won
since the Met Mile at Belmont last May. But he had been in seven
consecutive Grade I or Grade II races.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Bear rallied from almost six lengths back after the opening
half-mile went in 454/5 seconds. Lexington Park held the lead until
Sir Bear got past with less than 100 yards to go, and favored Forty
One Carats finished sixth after fading from second. nn

Big Numbers falters in Lone Star Derby (For use by NYTimes News
Service clients) 
By TIM PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas _ Jockey Donnie Meche didn't have an
explanation as to why Big Numbers flattened out in the stretch and
finished third as the favorite Saturday in the Lone Star Derby. Big
Numbers came into the race after a strong second-place finish in
the Grade III Rebel Stakes at Oaklawn Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to say about him,'' Meche said. ``He trained
real well. He just didn't run the race he did in the Rebel.''
</P>
<P>
   Big Numbers, sent into the race by Lone Star leading trainer
Steve Asmussen, was within striking distance of the lead entering
the stretch. He was no more than 11/2 lengths back of Jeblar Sez
Who and eventual winner Tahkodha Hills with less than one-eighth of
a mile to go in the 11/16-mile race.
</P>
<P>
   He held third, but he was beaten by almost three lengths. It
appeared the only adjustment Meche had to make came when he swung
the colt around Bullet Buzz in the first turn. But that got Big
Numbers off the rail, which has been dead most of the season at
Lone Star.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Bullet Buzz) got in front of me away from the gates,'' Meche
said. ``He went down on the fence, and I got to the outside of him.
He eased out and bumped me a little bit, but my horse was on the
bit the whole time.'' PARK STROLLS
</P>
<P>
   At odds of 96 to 1, Lexington Park was a surprise runner-up in
the Texas Mile. Sir Bear wasn't able to put him away until the
final 50 yards of the race. He made it tough on Sir Bear when he
bore out in deep stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just got a little over-aggressive,'' jockey Jeremy Beasley
said. ``He's a competitor. He didn't do anything I didn't expect
from him.'' GRADED STATUS
</P>
<P>
   Lone Star officials are hoping that the Lone Star Derby can
attain graded status from the North American Graded Stakes
Committee. Though this is the first time a previous winner of a
graded stakes has won the Derby (Tahkodha Hills won the Grade III
What A Pleasure Stakes last year at Calder), Lone Star director of
racing Larry Craft said that won't help. ``It depends on how the
horses do after this race,'' Craft said. BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Unshaded, an allowance winner at Gulfstream Park, came from

DEAR COMANDANTE: SNITCH THREATENS OUR CONQUEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By O. RICARDO PIMENTEL  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX It's been one of the more common complaints. ``You
people are taking over.'' OK, you've got me. I admit it. There is a
conspiracy. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Dear Comandante: &QL; 
Re: The reconquest, status report.
</P>
<P>
   They're on to us.
</P>
<P>
   My apologies, Estimado Comandante. I know you told us that you
wanted this to be the stealth reconquest, but somewhere, somehow,
someone has ratted us out.
</P>
<P>
   I've been racking my brain for what went wrong. There has to be
a snitch. I believe our efforts to date have been flawless.
</P>
<P>
   We've infilitrated key industries. When the uprising begins, we
will be well-positioned.
</P>
<P>
   I know in the past you've criticized our choice of industries,
particularly fast-food restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   I repeat: Troops gotta eat, and they don't have all day to wait
for a table. Thank you for suggesting drive-thrus, by the way.
We're still working on widening them for the battle tanks.
</P>
<P>
   And, judging from your comments in your last dispatch, you must
have missed my memo about our gardeners. Those leaf blowers double
as flame throwers, well worth the added expense. Please help me get
this one through the Finance Department. Those eggheads are really
raising a ruckus.
</P>
<P>
   You expressed some doubts about the domestics we have placed
into the homes of the affluent. I repeat, they are spies, our eyes
and ears.
</P>
<P>
   OK, that last batch of ``intelligence'' was not particularly
useful. But, respectfully, the sarcasm in your last dispatch about
the value of knowing that Mrs. Jarrod uses generic brand detergent
was unnecessary. And, no, the fact that Susie Allred got $5 from
the tooth fairy is not particularly relevant.
</P>
<P>
   I remain hopeful, however, that this particular mission will
bear fruit.
</P>
<P>
   We are, per your instructions, still working on ``Silicon
Valley.'' We've had some success but mostly in getting in on the
ground floor. Well, OK, cleaning the floors, but the point is:
We're inside.
</P>
<P>
   I hesitate to bring this next item up, but the troops are
grumbling and I feel compelled to tell you what's on their minds.
</P>
<P>
   They get paid so little and are growing tired of being blamed
for everything from crime to halitosis. I know it's all part of our
bosses' grand plan to create a labor surplus to depress wages. But,
goshdarnit, these folks have families to feed, and they've got
feelings, too.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. They are not completely ungrateful. Your
plan to get the Border Patrol to concentrate efforts at the border
while leaving the number of jobs available untouched is really
paying dividends.
</P>
<P>
   We've noticed also the good works of the marketing department.
We just laughed and laughed when we first saw Dinky the Chihuahua
on that first commercial. We've noticed also how other commercials
are increasingly featuring our people with heavy accents. It's
almost like our old co-conspirator Bill Dana, aka Jose Jimenez, is
back.
</P>
<P>
   We fully subscribe to the acclimation process you are beginning,
getting people used to the accents they will soon hear all the
time. A stroke of genius, mi comandante.
</P>
<P>
   Please don't pay attention to some of the grousing you hear from
some of our people about the stereotyping. Those Mexican-Americans
are a pesky bunch, but will come through as our fifth columnists in
a pinch. After all, they went along with your brilliant plan to
celebrate Cinco de Mayo.
</P>
<P>
   And they've really jumped onto this bilingual education
bandwagon in a big way, though they have this bothersome worry
about making sure the kids are educated well.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, however, our secret is out. Someone is orchestrating a
counterattack on the reconquest, and we are being accused of all
manner of wrongdoing. They say we're on welfare, we bring drugs
and, I like this one, we just come here to ``squirt out babies.''
</P>
<P>
   I wish we had thought of these things, but we will continue to
avoid them, per your instructions, lest we attract attention.
</P>
<P>
   I will continue my search for the snitch on my end, but would
not at all be surprised if the leak is coming from you guys.
</P>
<P>
   Just hear me out on this one.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of background check did we do on Dinky? That accent
isn't entirely believable.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, I've got to get back to writing on public-policy issues.
Say hi to the missus.
</P>
<P>
   Your faithful servant, &QR; 
O. Ricardo Pimentel &QR; 
P.S. Kudos to marketing for making salsa the country's No. 1
condiment. &QL;

CURVE OR HEAT, PERCIVAL WAS SWEET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ What makes Troy Percival's 95-mph
fastball effective is his 77-mph curveball. But when he has no
command of the curve he doesn't throw it, and hitters look for his
fastball and have a much better chance of hitting it.
</P>
<P>
   Percival got his fifth save of the season Friday night when he
retired Jose Canseco, Fred McGriff and Vinny Castilla in order.
</P>
<P>
   The most entertaining at-bat was Canseco's. Canseco swung and
missed a 95-mph fastball for strike one. He took a 77-mph curveball
for strike two. Then he struck out swinging on a 79-mph curveball
that was out of the strike zone, low and away.
</P>
<P>
   While walking back to the dugout, Canseco yelled at Percival:
``Be a man!'' insinuating Percival was less than a man for not
challenging him with fastballs. Percival just shrugged off
Canseco's display of machismo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he thinks everybody's supposed to throw him fastballs
all the time,'' Percival said.
</P>
<P>
   NEW RECORD: The home runs by Mo Vaughn, Tim Salmon and Troy
Glaus in both the fourth and ninth innings Friday night established
a major-league first.
</P>
<P>
   Never before, in the 172,235 games played in the history of
major-league baseball, had three players hit home runs in the same
inning twice in one game.
</P>
<P>
   BELCHER'S PROGRESS: Tim Belcher's performance (5 innings, 0
runs, 1 hit) in his rehab start for Single-A Lake Elsinore on
Thursday has the Angels thinking about how he'll fit in with the
club's pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher, recovering from elbow surgery, will make two more rehab
starts, both for Triple-A Edmonton. The first one will come next
Tuesday and the second April 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our reports on where he is now compared to two weeks ago are
very encouraging,'' Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. ``We're
hoping he'll throw the ball the best he has in the last three or
four years.''
</P>
<P>
   If he does, or is close to it, Scioscia will have to find a spot
for him in the rotation. But just who goes is a question Scioscia
hasn't answered yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll cross that bridge when we get to it,'' he said. ``We're
blessed with a lot of options as far as guys who are pitching well.
But (Belcher) is the kind of guy you want to give the ball to. He's
a great competitor. Bringing a good arm onto the club or rotation
is not a problem.'' &QL;

GALAXY SHUTS DOWN COLD FUSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ With the best collection of firepower Major
League Soccer has to offer, the end result is still a big dud for
the Miami Fusion.
</P>
<P>
   With Eric Wynalda, the U.S. national team's all-time leading
scorer, and Roy Lassiter, the league's all-time leading scorer,
Miami was shut out for the fourth consecutive game, losing 2-0 to
the Galaxy on Saturday in front of 16,885 at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Miami coach Ivo Wortmann, hoping to wake up his listless
strikers, benched Wynalda and Henry Gutierrez, but the results were
the same.
</P>
<P>
   Wynalda, from Westlake Village, finally entered along with
Gutierrez in the 64th minute, but the damage was done, allowing the
Galaxy to win their second straight match to stay unbeaten at
4-0-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Miami is) a team right now that is a little bit frustrated,''
said Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid. ``Once you can get up a couple of
goals on them, they're not necessarily all working well with each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy remained a point behind Kansas City (5-0-1) in the
Western Division standings after the Wizards beat Tampa Bay 1-0
earlier in the night to remain the only other unbeaten team.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Galaxy's good start, Schmid said there is plenty of
room to improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a coach, so I'm always not completely happy,'' said
Schmid. ``You always want to see a little bit better, a little bit
more. We are still giving the ball away when we don't need to. But
the last couple of days of practice we knocked the ball around well
and tonight we knocked it around well at times.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami midfielder Martin Machon discussed his team's 405 minute
scoreless drought despite having such talented strikers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our patience is running wild right now,'' said Machon, a
former Galaxy midfielder. ``Our coach has to do something, that's
his job. He has to work doing the week to see what's wrong and do
better for the next game.''
</P>
<P>
   Fusion goalkeeper Garth Lagerwey, starting his first game of the
season, was given a rude introduction moments into the match thanks
to a beautiful acting job by the Galaxy's Clint Mathis.
</P>
<P>
   On a Greg Vanney corner kick, Mathis was backpedaling as
Vanney's corner was knocked to the top of the penalty area. Fusion
defender Jay Heaps tried to slow Mathis by tugging his shirt, but
Mathis made it look much worse by falling hard to the turf,
catching the attention of referee Tim Weyland, who ordered a
penalty kick.
</P>
<P>
   Vanney converted the penalty, giving the Galaxy a 1-0 lead in
the third minute.
</P>
<P>
   In the 55th minute, Galaxy midfielder Danny Pena finished off
the Fusion for good, converting an errant clear by Miami and
sending a return shot to the far post to extend L.A.'s lead to
2-0. &QL;

THIS TIME, POWER SURGE HURTS ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ The idea is simple. The execution of it,
however, is not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to if you make good pitches, you'll get people
out,'' Angels manager Mike Scioscia said after the Tampa Bay Devil
Rays hit five home runs including Bubba Trammell's game-winner in
the 10th to beat the Angels 11-9 in front of 22,042 Saturday
afternoon at Tropicana Field.
</P>
<P>
   The five homers set a Devil Rays record and came one day after
the Angels hit six to tie a club record. The Angels pitching, which
had been so good through the first two weeks of the season, has
come apart at the seams in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   Since last Sunday's 3-1 win over the White Sox, the Angels have
given up 58 runs in six games. They gave up double figures in four
of those games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're in a little streak where we're not making
good pitches on a consistent basis,'' Scioscia said. ``And you've
seen what can happen. We'll get back to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays got two home runs from Fred McGriff, and one each
by Jose Canseco, Dave Martinez and Trammell. Trammell, batting as a
pinch-hitter, hit a 3-2 change-up from Angels reliever Kent Mercker
over the left-field fence for the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   The other homers were just as damaging. The Angels had taken a
6-3 lead into the bottom of the fifth when starter Ramon Ortiz
threw a pitch to Canseco that was belted off the catwalk in center
field. The ball came straight down and landed on the field, but by
rule, it's a home run.
</P>
<P>
   The homer, which tied the game at 6, was estimated at 472 feet,
the longest in Tropicana Field history. A day earlier, the Angels'
Troy Glaus set the record with a 470-foot blast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pitch to Canseco probably wasn't the right selection at
the time,'' catcher Matt Walbeck said of the 0-1 fastball.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz gave up six runs and five hits, but his six-inning outing
was the longest by an Angels starter in the past four days.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a little squirrelly at times,'' Walbeck said of Ortiz.
``Obviously he has room for improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   The game remained tied at 6 until the seventh inning when
McGriff faced Shigetoshi Hasegawa with two on and two out. McGriff
took a 2-2 curveball that appeared to drop in for strike three, but
plate umpire Paul Emmel ruled it a ball. On a full count, McGriff
hammered Hasegawa's next pitch into the right-field seats for a 9-6
Devil Rays lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``(McGriff) was looking away, away,'' Hasegawa said. ``I always
pitch him away. But I threw it middle-in and it surprised him.''
</P>
<P>
   It also seemed to surprise Emmel, but nobody would use it as an
excuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ump makes a call, ball or strike, and you have to live
with it,'' Scioscia said. ``It's tough to have it come down to one
pitch or one situation and say `What if?' There are a lot of
opportunities. You make good pitches on a consistent basis, it
won't come down to one pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the game ended on one bad pitch after the Angels had
rallied with one run in the eighth and two more in the ninth to tie
it. With two out and a runner on second in the bottom of the 10th,
Mercker tried to throw his change-up down but left it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bounce it, in the dirt, on the plate, anything but wood,''
Mercker said. ``I wish I was hitting and got that pitch. ... It
wasn't the wrong pitch, just a bad pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   With first base open, Scioscia considered walking Trammell to
pitch to Miguel Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about it,'' Scioscia said. ``Trammell's been hot,
but mostly against right-handed pitchers. We thought it was a good
matchup with Mercker's off-speed stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Closer Troy Percival got up in the bullpen in the ninth but was
back on the bench in the 10th when the game was decided. Scioscia
said he'd prefer not to use Percival unless they have a lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a big enough game and the situation's right, we'll
consider anything,'' Scioscia said. ``But it has to be special
circumstances for him to come into a game like today's.'' &QL;
