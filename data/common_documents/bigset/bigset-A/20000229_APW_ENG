<HEADLINE> Flood Waters Threaten Mozambique  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE COHEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- Rescuers plucked thousands of people from trees
and rooftops Monday, but many others were left behind and forced to spend
another night on precarious perches above rising flood waters in Mozambique.
Officials say thousands have died in the deluge.
</P>
<P>
	   Maj. Louis Kirsten, a spokesman for the South African military, said
helicopters rescued more than 3,000 people Monday, including everyone in
immediate danger along a particularly hard-hit area of the Limpopo River.
</P>
<P>
	   But Michele Quintaglie, a spokeswoman for the U.N. World Food Program, said
thousands more were still at risk.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're a long way from being able to rescue everybody,'' Quintaglie said.
``There will be thousands of people left behind tonight. These people will be on
their own to get through the night.''
</P>
<P>
	   While there was no precise death toll, Quintaglie said it was certain that
the number of dead was in the thousands. Other aid workers said the toll would
continue to climb, especially as people begin dying of flood-borne diseases over
the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mozambican government estimates more than 200,000 people have been left
homeless since torrential rains hit the impoverished African nation three weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
	   South Africa said it would send three more military helicopters Monday to
join the five already in operation. Even with the new aircraft, it could take
days to rescue everyone.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Not by a long shot is this over. It seems like the water is still
rising,'' Quintaglie said.
</P>
<P>
	   Government aircraft flew along the Limpopo River on Monday warning residents
downstream to evacuate.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Tom Harrer, an adviser to the government's disaster agency, said
many people refused to heed the warnings and were ``unprepared for the extent of
the floods, which are the highest levels we have recorded.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday, a wall of water 6 feet high hit Chokwe, a town of about 40,000
people about 125 miles north of the capital of Maputo, submerging it in a matter
of hours.
</P>
<P>
	   Flight crews said a lake of water about 18 miles wide surrounded Chokwe and
that the Limpopo River, which normally was less than a half mile wide, was about
6 miles across near Chokwe.
</P>
<P>
	   Paul Tyndale-Biscoe, a water engineer who was in Chokwe when the flood hit,
said he saw human bodies and cattle carcasses being swept along the raging flood
waters. A South African pilot said the flood also destroyed about 150 tons of
food aid at the main depot in Chokwe.
</P>
<P>
	   Quintaglie said helicopters Monday concentrated on rescuing people stranded
in trees near Chokwe -- whenever possible first saving those holding on to
children.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In some places, people had been hanging onto branches overnight with
children on their backs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday, rescue crews watched helplessly as buildings collapsed moments
before helicopters could reach them, dumping scores of men, women and children
into the swirling waters.
</P>
<P>
	   The World Food Program said 55,000 people needed to be evacuated in the
southern Gaza province and that 30,000 needed to be moved from the Save River
(pronounced sah-VEY) valley farther north.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Disaster Management Center said the situation was critical
downstream from Chokwe at Xai-Xai, the provincial capital of Gaza. It said roads
on both sides of the city of 130,000 had been washed away and that the city had
run out of fuel and had no power.
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands of people huddled together on tiny patches of high ground in both
the Limpopo and Save regions often raced each other to win seats on arriving
helicopters. Many people ferried to higher ground had to be rescued twice as
flood waters rose.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, more water was headed downstream into Mozambique's Cahora Bassa
Dam from its western neighbor, Zimbabwe, which Sunday released billions of
gallons from its overflowing Kariba Dam.
</P>
<P>
	   Zimbabwe's Civil Protection Unit said Monday that at least 80,000 people
were left homeless by floods in the east and south of that country. But
officials said the number could be far higher, since many of the affected areas
were inaccessible. Floods had swept away bridges and roads and rescue services
lacked aircraft for aerial surveillance.
</P>
<P>
	   In Botswana, 60,000 people had been left homeless by floods caused by four
weeks of heavy raining, said Dineo Mogwe, chairwoman of the National Disaster
Management Committee. Eight people had died.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton allocated $1 million to help pay for aircraft needed for
search and rescue operations and the delivery of relief supplies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The thoughts and prayers of the American people are with the people of the
region as they cope with this disaster,'' Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Britain made $1 million available Monday to fund the rescue operations. The
Canadian, German, Dutch, Swedish and Norwegian governments also pledged money.
In Geneva, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies
appealed for donations to keep rescue operations continuing.

<HEADLINE> White House Releases Medicare Study  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House is issuing a state-by-state study of
Medicare that administration officials say buttresses President Clinton's plan
to reform the program and add a prescription drug benefit for all recipients.
</P>
<P>
	   The study -- largely an attempt to pull together existing health, financing
and demographic data about the program-- was being released to coincide with
Senate Finance Committee hearings on Medicare reform Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
	   Referring to the hearings, White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said
Clinton believes Medicare reform should be a legislative priority this year.
``And if packaging this information focuses attention on it, it's all for the
better.''
</P>
<P>
	   Poverty among the elderly has dropped nearly two-thirds since the creation
of Medicare in 1968. But the number of beneficiaries will double to 80 million
over the next 30 years and the study warned that Medicare must change to deal
with the increase.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Medicare has not been given the tools it needs to be as competitive and
efficient as it needs to be in the 21st century,'' according to the study.
``Despite modern medicine's reliance on pharmaceuticals, the program does not
cover prescription drugs.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republican lawmakers have questioned whether offering prescription drug
coverage to all participants would be too costly, and they have proposed
offering such a benefit only to the neediest beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
	   But according to the study, most seniors enrolled in the program are
classified as middle income or higher and therefore wouldn't qualify for a
restricted benefit.
</P>
<P>
	   Only 22 percent of U.S. companies offer retiree health insurance with
prescription drug coverage, and only one-quarter of Medicare beneficiaries
receive such coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   The graying of America will have obvious effects on the Medicare system.
According to the report, 10 percent of the Medicare populations in 40 states are
85 or older.
</P>
<P>
	   States in the upper Midwest -- the Dakotas, Minnesota, Nebraska, Kansas and
Iowa -- have the highest population of what the report dubbed ``old elderly.''
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to adding the prescription drug benefit, the president has
proposed ways to make the program more competitive and efficient and called for
dedicating the non-Social Security portion of the on-budget surplus to Medicare.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All the statistics support the policies that the president is promoting on
Capitol Hill,'' said Chris Jennings, a White House adviser on healthcare.

<HEADLINE> Battle of Old and New Economies  </HEADLINE>
    By JOHN CUNNIFF AP Business Analyst
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- What this marketplace needs, the Federal Reserve seems to
have reasoned, is a good dose of fear. Fear dissolves dreams. It brings back
reality. It gets the economy back in balance.
</P>
<P>
	   Assumed in this theory is that things are unbalanced, and indeed there is
lots of evidence:
</P>
<P>
	   Investors buying into companies likely to evaporate within five years,
consumers running up debts faster than incomes, lotteries and casinos replacing
old-line businesses in local tax bases.
</P>
<P>
	   So much doesn't much sense, at least based on theories that people have
believed in for their entire lives. Where, for example, is inflation in all this
overborrowing and overspending?
</P>
<P>
	   Led by old-school economists, search parties have been looking for it every
day during the past four years. They haven't found it, but they say it just has
to be there. No ifs or buts about it.
</P>
<P>
	   Why? Because we have extraordinarily low unemployment, only 4 percent in
January. And everyone knows that when you scrape the bottom you have to raise
wages and probably hire less productive workers.
</P>
<P>
	   That's been true in the past, but in this economy wages haven't been rising
that much. And except for a few areas, including health care, energy and
housing, prices haven't been rising a whole lot.
</P>
<P>
	   But it's there, they say, and the way to bring it out of hiding and saving
this economy is create fear. Fear is a wonderful antidote to misbehavior; nobody
wants to have things falling in on them.
</P>
<P>
	   But today there is a counterbalance to fear, and it's called productivity.
How can people be fearful about the future when they witness the marvels of the
technological age, and then are told by those who claim to know that it's only a
preview of what's coming?
</P>
<P>
	   After the element of fear has been built relentlessly into the public
consciousness, there is some evidence that overspending and overborrowing might
be ebbing. And stocks have taken a nosedive.
</P>
<P>
	   This has created a new problem. Among investors most traumatized are those
inclined to invest only in the fairest of blue chips, whose share prices already
were in a deep correction. They fell even lower.
</P>
<P>
	   It is not difficult now to find sound, profitable, old-line companies with
price-earnings ratios -- the number of times earnings investors payto buy a
share -- in single digits, one-third their long-term norms.
</P>
<P>
	   Driven from such stocks by the fear of higher interest rates, investors have
flocked to high-tech stocks with price multiples that are100 times earnings.
That is, if these stocks have earnings at all.
</P>
<P>
	   The effect has been that of an economic hurricane driving a tidal surge
before it into a narrowing bay: a flood of investor money with a relatively few
high-tech stocks in which to invest.
</P>
<P>
	   There is, say the keepers of monetary policy, only one remedy for that,
which is for still another round of higher interest rates. The economy must
slow. Fear will do it.
</P>
<P>
	   The lines have now been formed, and the combatants are dug in, and
skirmishes are fought every day. You can read the list of casualties in your
newspaper each day in the stock tables.
</P>
<P>
	   But the market is only a reflection of what is going on behind the lines, in
the rest of the economy. The results are enough to frighten anyone into
constraining the urge to splurge.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, monetary officials concede they can't find much evidence of
inflation. And productivity continues to grow, taming the inflation which, in
the old economy, would have surfaced by now.
</P>
<P>
	   Risking oversimplification, you might view the war as between the old
economy, where inflation was an ever-present threat and a periodic scourge, and
the new economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Until lately, the new, young, vigorous economy was utterly fearless, perhaps
reckless, somewhat spendthrift and overly optimistic.
</P>
<P>
	   Too much like a teen-ager with a high-powered car, said the wise old
economists.

<HEADLINE> Study Cites Hate Groups on I-5  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM KLAHN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- White supremacist groups are flourishing along the populous
Interstate 5 corridor in Washington and Oregon, recruiting suburban young people
who feel their culture is threatened, the Northwest Coalition for Human Dignity
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We talk about (hate groups) as if they only exist in Idaho and Montana,
and the heaviest concentration is right here in Puget Sound,'' said Terre
Rybovich, coalition executive director.
</P>
<P>
	   In its first annual ``Hate by State'' report, the coalition that monitors
hate groups drew a regional map, using iron crosses as symbols, showing 52 white
supremacist groups.
</P>
<P>
	   They range from several chapters of the World Church of the Creator and
other religious entities to Ku Klux Klan, and neo-Nazi organizations to
militias.
</P>
<P>
	   Seventeen of the groups were in Washington and 13 in Oregon, all but a few
arrayed along I-5, the main north-south highway from California to Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   There were also 11 in Idaho -- all but one in the Panhandle -- five in
Montana and three each in Wyoming and Colorado.
</P>
<P>
	   Rybovich said she was surprised at the number of groups whose names were
ferreted out in Washington and Oregon. She said the number was growing ``and
that is our greatest cause for concern.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rybovich said while her organization had been able to get a count of
organizations, it wasn't able to provide a head count of skinheads, neo-Nazis,
religious and patriotic zealots and others counted among white supremacist
ranks.
</P>
<P>
	   She said the numbers for each group are likely small, since those in the
white supremacist movement have learned the best way to avoid detection is to
work locally, using small meetings and e-mail.
</P>
<P>
	   Where they do show up, she said, is at public schools or other places they
believe are ripe for recruiting.
</P>
<P>
	   James Aho, a sociologist at Idaho State University who has written two books
on the white supremacy movement, took issue with the coalition's assertion that
the white supremacist movement is growing.
</P>
<P>
	   He said there are occasional killings and ``these are terrible tragedies.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``But the right-wing rhetoric doesn't seem to catch the public imagination
as it used to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Northwest Coalition for Human Dignity was founded in 1989 as the
Northwest Coalition Against Malicious Harassment by Catholic Priest and activist
Bill Wassmuth in response to organizing and actions by the Aryan Nations and
other supremacist groups.

Elsewhere in Japan, six meteorological observatories and seismographs set up at

New Charges Against 'Sammy the Bull'

	   PHOENIX (AP) -- Former Mafia hitman Salvatore "Sammy the Bull" Gravano,
arrested last week for allegedly masterminding a statewide drug ring, was
charged Monday with racketeering, conspiracy and money laundering. Attorney
General Janet Napolitano filed a new complaint, charging Gravano, three family
members and 42 others with a total of 181 counts. They had all initially been
arrested on a single count of conspiracy to distribute a dangerous drug. The
ecstasy drug ring, which allegedly started as a small-scale operation, was
selling 20,000 to 30,000 pills a week once Gravano put his weight behind it,
authorities said. The designer drug sells for $20 to $30 per pill.

Austria's Freedom Party Leader Steps Down

<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Austrian right-wing leader Joerg Haider resigned as
head of the Freedom Party today, seen by some as a way to end his country's
international ostrascism. The outrage was based on Haider's anti-immigrant stand
and his past praise of World War II veterans of Germany's murderous Waffen SS
and Adolf Hitler's "orderly" employment policies. Haider holds no post in the
national government, But his image and his iron-hand control of the Freedom
Party made him the most visible member of the Austrian political establishment,
eclipsing his governing coalition partners, the center-right Austrian People's
Party of Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel.

came back with smothering defense after they fell behind 37-17. Mourning was not

he said he won't make the trip for Tuesday's game at San Antonio. Heat guard

<HEADLINE> Indians Sentenced Over Donations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Two officials of the Cabazon Band of Mission Indians were
fined and sentenced to probation Monday for illegally routing thousands of
dollars in tribal money to the 1996 Clinton-Gore re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Nichols and Greg Cervantes, both non-Indians, pleaded guilty in October
to misdemeanor federal charges of using tribal money to make illegal ``conduit''
campaign donations -- contributions made in the name of someone who is then
reimbursed.
</P>
<P>
	   Such a scheme hides the true source of the money and allows donors to get
around campaign contribution limits. In this case, the true and unwitting donor
was the Cabazon Band, according to the U.S. Attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
	   There is no evidence Clinton or Gore or any of their staff members knew the
contributions were illegal.
</P>
<P>
	   Nichols, 41, chief executive officer of the Cabazon Band, pleaded guilty to
three counts of causing the donations. Cervantes, 38, director of special
affairs for the tribe, pleaded to one.
</P>
<P>
	   Nichols has already paid a $56,000 administrative fine and more than half of
a $200,000 criminal fine. Cervantes has already paid a $26,000 administrative
fine to the Federal Election Commission and has agreed to pay a $13,000 criminal
fine.

<HEADLINE> No. 14 Texas 68, No. 23 Kansas 54  </HEADLINE>
    By JIM VERTUNO AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Ivan Wagner scored a career-high 19 points and Gabe
Muoneke added 16 as No. 14 Texas stayed in contention for the Big 12 title with
a 68-54 win Monday night over No. 23 Kansas.
</P>
<P>
	   Chris Owens added 11 points for Texas (21-7, 12-3), which remains a game
behind conference leader Iowa State. It was Texas' first win over Kansas (21-8,
10-5) since 1938.
</P>
<P>
	   The Longhorns are 2-7 against the Jayhawks overall, and 1-3 since the Big 12
was formed.
</P>
<P>
	   The defending regular season champions need to win at Kansas State on
Saturday and hope for an unlikely loss by Iowa State to either Texas Tech or
Baylor, who are a combined 6-22 in the conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Kirk Hinrich was the only Jayhawks player in double figures with 11 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas jumped out to a 14-2 lead on 3-pointers by Wagner and William Clay.
Owens then scored six straight points, including a layup when he slapped the
ball away at midcourt and spun around two Jayhawks players near the basket for a
layup to bring the crowd of a 13,561 to its feet.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas was equally effective on defense, harassing Kansas into missing 13 of
its first 16 shots and 11 turnovers in the first 14 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   The Longhorns also shot 54 percent in the first half, thanks to six dunks on
breakaway and alley-oop baskets. Muoneke had 10 points in the half, six on
dunks.
</P>
<P>
	   Kansas' frustration was capsulized on one play when Drew Gooden missed a
3-pointer. Three Jayhawks players converged on the long rebound only to knock it
to Clay. Clay beat the defense downcourt for a dunk and a 28-10 lead. The
Longhorns led 38-21 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   Kansas finally showed signs of life in the second. The Jayhawks scored the
first two baskets after halftime and Texas missed its first five shots.
</P>
<P>
	   Kansas cut the lead to 42-30 on five straight points by Eric Chenowith and
finally cut the lead to 46-36 on a steal and layup by Hinrich with 11:58 left.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas coach Rick Barnes called a timeout and the Longhorns came back with a
3-pointer from Wagner and yet another breakaway dunk by Muoneke to push the lead
to 55-38.
</P>
<P>
	   Kansas twice cut the lead to 10 in the final five minutes, the last at 59-49
with 3:09 left, but hit just three field goals over the final seven minutes and
couldn't make a final push. The Jayhawks finished with seven assists against 17
turnovers and shot just 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Longhorns junior Chris Mihm, considered the best pure center in college
basketball, had a relatively quiet game with nine points in what may be his last
game in the Erwin Center.
</P>
<P>
	   Mihm was 4-of-8 from the floor and grabbed 12 rebounds as the crowd chanted,
"One more year!" Mihm has not said if he will turn pro after the season.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas is 5-5 against ranked teams this season.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Radio Liberty correspondent Andrei Babitsky, whose detention
by Russian forces in Chechnya sparked protest inside Russia and abroad, was
freed from custody early Tuesday, Russian media reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The move came less than a day after acting President Vladimir Putin publicly
questioned the Interior Ministry's handling of the case and suggested that there
was insufficient reason to keep the reporter in detention.
</P>
<P>
	   Babitsky, whose reporting from the rebel side in Chechnya had angered
Russian officials, was detained in Chechnya in January and turned over to rebels
in exchange for captured Russian soldiers. Many of Babitsky's colleagues doubted
the government's portrayal of the exchange, and feared he had been killed.
</P>
<P>
	   Babitsky resurfaced Friday in the custody of officials in Makhachkala, the
capital of the Russian republic of Dagestan, which borders Chechnya. He was
charged with carrying a forged Azerbaijani passport and officials also took up
earlier charges of Babitsky's alleged links with Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   Hours after Putin's intervention on Monday, Babitsky was flown to Moscow.
The Interior Ministry press service said that the charges against him did not
merit his being kept in custody, but the investigation will continue, NTV
television reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin stepped into the case Monday, telling the Interior Ministry and the
prosecutor general's office that Babitsky should not be held in custody,
Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
	   But echoing the government's contention that some accounts of the war in
Chechnya have been politically motivated, Putin alleged that Babitsky was trying
to sell the rebels' point of view. ``He handled this task pretty well,'' Putin
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
	   Foreign officials have pressed Russia to clear up the case, saying
Babitsky's detention added to concern over alleged human rights violations in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin insisted that investigators' handling of the case was strictly
according to the law, Interfax reported. However, he said he told Interior
Minister Vladimir Rushailo that ``it is inexpedient to hold Babitsky in custody,
and I asked him to deal with this case more carefully.''

<HEADLINE> Alleged Cuba Spy Faces Deadline  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM COHEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TORONTO (AP) -- An alleged Cuban spy permitted into Canada after being
expelled from the United States stayed inside the Cuban Embassy on Monday as the
time limit on his two-day transit visa ran out.
</P>
<P>
	   Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy said Jose Imperatori, 46, would
become an illegal alien if he remained in Canada beyond the two-day limit
allowed by the visa granted Imperatori upon his arrival in Montreal on Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   As of early Tuesday, Imperatori remained in Cuba's embassy in Ottawa. It was
not immediately clear how he would leave Canada if he wanted to. There were no
commercial flights scheduled to leave for Havana until later Tuesday morning,
meaning he would require a private charter or a flight arranged by one of the
governments involved if he wanted to leave earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Imperatori was taken into custody by U.S. authorities and flown to Montreal
aboard a U.S. government plane late Saturday. He had been expected to leave
Canada for Havana on Sunday, but did not do so. Even his family members in Cuba
said they weren't sure when he would arrive home.
</P>
<P>
	   Axworthy said Canada wanted no role in the latest diplomatic fracas between
Cuba and the United States, and refused to specify what would happen if
Imperatori refused to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We'll have to see if the Cuban authorities live up to their
responsibilities and their basic rules and connections of diplomacy,'' Axworthy
said. ``We were simply providing a courtesy to allow him to transfer back to
Cuba, and we expect them to recognize just exactly what it was.''
</P>
<P>
	   Imperatori's wife, Raquel Fundora, and the couple's 3-year-old son returned
to Havana from the United States on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, Imperatori resigned his consular position, giving up his
diplomatic immunity, and said he intended to defy the U.S. State Department's
expulsion order so he could contest allegations linking him with U.S.
immigration official Mariano Faget, who has been charged with spying for Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   FBI officials escorted Imperatori, accompanied by his lawyer, from his
suburban Maryland apartment to the plane that flew him to Montreal on Saturday
night. The State Department said he was expelled for not voluntarily leaving by
the appointed time.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuban officials say that they believe the allegations are a smokescreen to
block the return of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to his father in Cuba.

<HEADLINE> GM Introduces New Cadillac  </HEADLINE>
    By BRUCE STANLEY AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GENEVA (AP) -- General Motors Corp. introduced a sleek prototype of its new
Cadillac, offering a glimpse of a high-tech vision it hopes will capture the
imagination of European drivers long loyal to other brands of luxury car.
</P>
<P>
	   Billed as a four-seat luxury sports sedan, the Cadillac Imaj marries
innovative engineering with a compact, angular frame. Among its features are an
aluminum chassis, obstacle-alert sensors, back doors that open rearward
automatically and personal computers for each of four occupants.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's meant to show technology. It's meant to be provocative," said Simon
Cox, who led the engineering and design team that created the Imaj.
</P>
<P>
	   GM, which unveiled the car late Monday -- the eve of this week's
International Motor Show in Geneva, will only produce it in limited numbers, if
it decides to produce it at all.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, the Imaj represents a new commitment by the company to upgrade
Cadillac's image in Europe, perhaps the world's fussiest markets for
top-of-the-line cars.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's part of the process of reestablishing Cadillac as the global luxury
leader," said G. Richard Wagoner, Jr., GM's president and chief operating
officer.
</P>
<P>
	   Cadillac needs the boost; Europeans bought just 1,500 of the cars last year.
</P>
<P>
	   GM continues to rely on its Opel, Vauxhall and Saab brands for most of its
sales in Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're the home brands. They carry the load," Wagoner said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Cadillac, and to some extent Chevrolet, are names that GM hopes to do
more to popularize in this part of the world.
</P>
<P>
	   "Europe's huge. It's a sophisticated market on one hand, and on the other,
it's a growing market, with Eastern Europe," Wagoner said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said that General Motors had 9.8 percent of the market for cars and
trucks in all of Europe last year, up from 9.6 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   "Frankly, we'd like to see ourselves grow some. We'd like to get some more
innovative products in our program."
</P>
<P>
	   The Imaj is one such example. So too are the new Opel Agila microvan and
Speedster sports car -- models GM introduced together with the Imaj.
</P>
<P>
	   "They are part of the most sweeping product offensive in the history of
Opel," said Robert Hendry, Opel's chairman and managing director.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, GM must cut costs wherever possible, Wagoner said.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, the company and its rivals Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler
Corp. announced a plan to form an electronic exchange for buying supplies.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it definitely has the opportunity to reduce costs for us," Wagoner
said of the online trading network. "We hope others will join."

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves Once-a-Day Allergy Drug  </HEADLINE>
   By PHIL GALEWITZ AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- This spring, hayfever sufferers will get to choose from two
prescription drugs that are taken once a day and don't make you sleepy.
</P>
<P>
	   Until now, Claritin has been the only antihistamine with both advantages.
</P>
<P>
	   The Food and Drug Administration has approved a once-daily version of
Allegra, giving its manufacturer a new weapon to challenge Claritin, the world's
most popular prescription antihistamine. Previously, Allegra had to be taken
twice a day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This will put us on equal footing,'' said Suzanne Wiele, a spokeswoman for
Aventis, the French-German pharmaceutical firm that makes Allegra. The new pill
will be available in mid-March, Aventis said Monday in announcing the FDA
approval.
</P>
<P>
	   The once-a-day version of Allegra will sell for $2.07 per pill compared to
$2.24 for Claritin, although both are usually covered by health insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   About 35 million Americans suffer from hay fever, known medically as
allergic rhinitis. The condition is triggered by airborne pollen that emanates
seasonally from grass, ragweed and trees. Hay fever season gets under way next
month in most parts of the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, Allegra had about $700 million in worldwide sales, making it a
distant second to Schering-Plough's Claritin, which had $2.7 billion in sales.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Allegra will gain some market share,'' predicted Joseph Riccardo, an
analyst with Bear Stearns.
</P>
<P>
	   Schering-Plough has overcome pressure to its signature product.
</P>
<P>
	   Claritin grew rapidly in the mid-1990s despite the introduction of Pfizer's
Zyrtec and Allegra's twice-a-day version. One reason is that Schering Plough has
advertised it heavily to consumers, increasing the number of people seeking
prescription drugs to treat their allergies instead of relying on
over-the-counter remedies.
</P>
<P>
	   Claritin's success can also be attributed to the convenience of once-daily
dosages and the fact that it doesn't make users sleepy.
</P>
<P>
	   Zyrtec is a once-a-day allergy pill, but does cause drowsiness.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDA also approved Allegra for children as young as six, and for hives,
an allergic reaction that causes the skin to become red and itchy. But in both
of those cases, the drug needs to be taken twice a day. Claritin is taken once
daily in these cases.
</P>
<P>
	   Ken Nover, an analyst with A.G. Edwards, predicted Allegra sales will
increase, but he doesn't expect Claritin to lose its No. 1 spot because it has
been on the market since 1993 and is well established.
</P>
<P>
	   The most common side effect for both drugs is headache.
</P>
<P>
	   Claritin's first patent is set to expire in 2002, meaning the drug will face
competition from cheaper generics that year. Schering-Plough is seeking FDA
approval for its next generation allergy drug, which is expected to take effect
more quickly than Claritin.

<HEADLINE> SEC Supports Lower Trading Fees  </HEADLINE>
    By DUNSTAN PRIAL AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Securities regulators and Wall Street officials are lining
up to support proposed legislation that would dramatically reduce stock trading
transaction fees charged to investors.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed bill, which would also slash registration fees paid by
companies planning to issue stock, as well as charges related to mergers and
tender offers, is designed to bring fees collected by the SEC more in line with
the agency's budget.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the current fee system, the SEC collects about five times more than
its annual budget. The agency raked in $1.7 billion in fees in 1999. It's
budget, meanwhile, came to just $339 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The surplus emerged and grew in the 1990s as stock trading volume increased,
in part due to an explosion in online trading by individual investors. The extra
money goes to the U.S. Treasury Department and is then distributed to other
government programs.
</P>
<P>
	   "The proposed legislation you are considering today achieves meaningful
reductions in fee rates in a comprehensive manner," Securities and Exchange
Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt told members of the Senate Banking Committee,
which held hearings Monday at the SEC's field office in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill under consideration would alter the fee structure so the agency
would collect fees totaling just twice the agency's annual budget.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Phil Graham, R-Texas, chairman of the Banking Committee, said the only
hurdle facing the bill is convincing voters and their Congressional
representatives that the legislation benefits small investors as well as large
Wall Street trading firms.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is basically a working person issue," Graham said.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors stand to save $7 billion over five years if stock trading
transaction fees are reduced in accordance with the proposed legislation, titled
the Competitive Market Supervision Act, Graham said.
</P>
<P>
	   Those savings could be plowed into mutual funds and retirement plans, Graham
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Levitt, in answer to a question from Sen. Rod Grams, R-Minnesota, said
individual investors pay 87 percent of the transaction fees assessed for trading
New York Stock Exchange stocks, and 82 percent of the fees for trading Nasdaq
stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   Levitt added, however, that he feared some politicians might "demagogue" the
bill by labeling it a tax break for wealthy Wall Street firms.
</P>
<P>
	   J. Patrick Campbell, chief operating officer of the Nasdaq market, was one
of several Wall Street officials who testified in favor of the bill.
</P>
<P>
	   The fees, Campbell said, "comprise a tax because they are charged in excess
of the governmental purpose for which they were enacted. The excess collections
should be returned to investors to employ toward the continued growth of the
economy."
</P>
<P>
	   Officials from the New York Stock Exchange and three Wall Street trade
organizations -- the Securities Industry Association, the Securities Traders
Association and the Specialists Association -- also testified in support of the
bill.
</P>
<P>
	   Levitt used the hearing to plead his case for additional funding to hire and
retain qualified SEC staffers. The agency has requested a 12 percent budget
increase over 1999. Part of the money will pay for 50 additional employees.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC chairman has complained that the SEC is losing top employees to
higher paying jobs in the private sector.

<HEADLINE> No. 14 Texas 68, No. 23 Kansas 54  </HEADLINE>
    By JIM VERTUNO AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Ivan Wagner scored a career-high 19 points and Gabe
Muoneke added 16 as No. 14 Texas kept alive its slim hopes for the Big 12 title
with a 68-54 win Monday night over No. 23 Kansas.
</P>
<P>
	   Chris Owens added 11 points for Texas (21-7, 12-3), which remains a game
behind conference leader Iowa State. It was Texas' first win over Kansas (21-8,
10-5) since 1938.
</P>
<P>
	   The Longhorns are 2-7 against the Jayhawks overall, and 1-3 since the Big 12
was formed.
</P>
<P>
	   The defending regular season champions need to win at Kansas State on
Saturday and hope for an unlikely losses by Iowa State to both Texas Tech and
Baylor, who are a combined 6-22 in the conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Kirk Hinrich was the only Jayhawks player in double figures with 11 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas jumped out to a 14-2 lead on 3-pointers by Wagner and William Clay.
Owens then scored six straight points, including a layup when he slapped the
ball away at midcourt and spun around two Jayhawks players near the basket for a
layup to bring the crowd of a 13,561 to its feet.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas was equally effective on defense, harassing Kansas into missing 13 of
its first 16 shots and 11 turnovers in the first 14 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   The Longhorns also shot 54 percent in the first half, thanks to six dunks on
breakaway and alley-oop baskets. Muoneke had 10 points in the half, six on
dunks.
</P>
<P>
	   Kansas' frustration was capsulized on one play when Drew Gooden missed a
3-pointer. Three Jayhawks players converged on the long rebound only to knock it
to Clay. Clay beat the defense downcourt for a dunk and a 28-10 lead. The
Longhorns led 38-21 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   Kansas finally showed signs of life in the second. The Jayhawks scored the
first two baskets after halftime and Texas missed its first five shots.
</P>
<P>
	   Kansas cut the lead to 42-30 on five straight points by Eric Chenowith and
finally cut the lead to 46-36 on a steal and layup by Hinrich with 11:58 left.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas coach Rick Barnes called a timeout and the Longhorns came back with a
3-pointer from Wagner and yet another breakaway dunk by Muoneke to push the lead
to 55-38.
</P>
<P>
	   Kansas twice cut the lead to 10 in the final five minutes, the last at 59-49
with 3:09 left, but hit just three field goals over the final seven minutes and
couldn't make a final push. The Jayhawks finished with seven assists against 17
turnovers and shot just 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Longhorns junior Chris Mihm, considered the best pure center in college
basketball, had a relatively quiet game with nine points in what may be his last
game in the Erwin Center.
</P>
<P>
	   Mihm was 4-of-8 from the floor and grabbed 12 rebounds as the crowd chanted,
"One more year!" Mihm has not said if he will turn pro after the season.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas is 5-5 against ranked teams this season.

<HEADLINE> Rockets 96, Clippers 77  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Cuttino Mobley came off the bench to score 21 points and
Houston's reserves scored 63 points Monday night as the Rockets snapped a
five-game losing streak with a 96-77 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers.
</P>
<P>
	   Matt Bullard added 14 points and seven rebounds for the Rockets, who were
without Hakeem Olajuwon as they ended a seven-game road skid.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rockets' all-time leading scorer flew back to Houston for tests to
determine the cause of his fatigue, which plagued him during the previous three
games and limited him to only 13 minutes on Sunday against the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rockets also held Los Angeles to 26.8 field goal shooting, breaking the
Rockets' previous best defensive effort set Feb. 5, 1969, when they held the
Cincinnati Royals to 28.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Rookie Lamar Odom had 20 points and 11 rebounds for the Clippers, whose 28th
loss in 31 games coincidentally was their 28th in their last 31 meetings with
the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
	   After trailing by as many as 25 points with 6:22 left in the third quarter,
the Clippers got seven points from Odom in a 1:37 span to fuel an 18-3 blitz.
Odom's 3-pointer capped the rally, slicing Houston's lead to 72-62 with 1:13
left in the period.
</P>
<P>
	   Mobley and Carlos Rogers did all the scoring in a 9-0 run early in the
fourth to extend the margin to 83-64 with 8:11 left, and the Clippers got no
closer than 13 points the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
	   Houston never trailed, building a 58-36 halftime lead with 10 baskets from
3-point range and a combined 27 points from Mobley and Bullard. The Rockets
opened up a 15-point lead with a 10-2 spurt at the start of the second quarter
and Bullard capped the half with a 3-pointer just before the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clippers, who shot 25.5 percent in the opening half, missed 33 of their
first 42 field goal attempts -- including a ridiculously easy layup by Tyrone
Nesby early in the second quarter and six more shots during one possession less
than five minutes before halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   Maurice Taylor, still upset about not going to the New York Knicks before
the trading deadline, shot 2-for-10 in the half and 4-for-17 for the game.
</P>
<P>
	   Taylor got into it with the angry home crowd of 12,940, which gave him an
exaggerated cheer after his layup cut the Rockets' lead to 17 points with eight
minutes left. As he left the court, the three-year veteran forward answered the
fans with a raise-the-roof motion.
</P>
<P>
	   Rookie-of-the-year candidate Steve Francis, who missed 15 consecutive shots
during a two-game span -- including his first nine on Sunday against the Lakers
-- missed his first seven attempts against the Clippers before dunking the ball
with 10:22 left in the second quarter. He finished 2-for-12.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Maker Discussing Regulation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Philip Morris Co., the nation's largest tobacco producer,
is willing to negotiate over government regulation of the industry, according to
a company official.
</P>
<P>
	   Senior vice president Steven Parrish discussed the concept with both The
Wall Street Journal and Washington Post. He said a formal announcement would
come Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Parrish said he has met in recent weeks with several lawmakers of both
parties to discuss the company's "willingness to open up a dialogue and look at
the right regulatory approach," once the Supreme Court rules on a pending case
involving the Food and Drug Administration's bid to claim jurisdiction over
tobacco as a drug that should be regulated.
</P>
<P>
	   "We realize there are legitimate issues involving our products," Parrish was
quoted as saying on the Journal's Web site.
</P>
<P>
	   "I could see at some point in the future an appropriate way to regulate
tobacco products," Parrish said in Tuesday's Post.
</P>
<P>
	   FDA officials contacted Monday night by The Associated Press said they were
unaware of Parish's statements and had no immediate comment. Messages left for
Philip Morris officials were not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
	   The statements are a departure from the industry's long-held stance against
government oversight.
</P>
<P>
	   The industry said it would be open to regulation on terms that would have to
be negotiated. Industry executives oppose restrictions drawn up by the FDA and
have said if the agency prevails before the Supreme Court, they will lobby
Congress for regulations more to their liking.
</P>
<P>
	   But, according to the Journal, Philip Morris said that even if the high
court rules the FDA doesn't have authority over the industry, the company still
wants to talk to Congress about establishing federal regulation of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
	   The comments come amid a push by Philip Morris to improve its public image,
including a $100 million campaign to publicize how it has helped disaster
victims, the hungry and abused women.
</P>
<P>
	   The maker of Marlboro and other brands said recently that tobacco marketing
was "fundamentally changed" by the industry's 1998 multibillion-dollar
settlement agreement with the states over the costs of treating sick smokers.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the Journal, Philip Morris's agenda with Congress includes
developing rules to guide the development of potentially less risky cigarettes
and lay out how such products can be marketed, possibly expanding warning labels
and more extensive disclosures about the harmful ingredients in cigarettes.

<HEADLINE> Warriors 80, Hawks 75  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Donyell Marshall scored 23 points and
grabbed 21 rebounds as the Golden State Warriors defeated the
Atlanta Hawks 80-75 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Larry Hughes added 23 points and 10 rebounds as the Warriors
snapped a two-game losing streak by winning their third straight at
home. It was just the fifth time this season Golden State won when
trailing after three quarters.
</P>
<P>
	   Isaiah Rider scored 24 points to lead the Hawks. Dikembe Mutombo
added 13 points and 22 rebounds, the ninth time this season he's
grabbed 20 or more rebounds. Jim Jackson had 21 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes sealed the victory with a basket as the 24-second clock
was running out with 28 seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
	   Golden State took its first lead of the night with 8:44
remaining when Marshall scored from underneath. The Warriors
eventually led by as many as nine points down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
	   The Warriors outscored Atlanta 11-5 to open the third quarter to
close to 46-44. Golden State stayed close, and when Hughes hit the
Warriors' first 3-pointer of the night with 1:34 left in the
period, they were within one at 59-58.
</P>
<P>
	   Atlanta never trailed in the first half, leading by as many as
14 points when Chris Crawford's basket put the Hawks up 32-18 with
7:06 left in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   The Warriors missed nine of their first 10 shots and found
themselves in an early 13-2 hole as the Hawks ran off 11 unanswered
points in the first 4:30.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hawks led 41-33 at halftime. While it was the fewest points
Golden State has allowed an opponent in the first half since the
Chicago Bulls scored 33 on Nov. 16, it was also the fewest the
Warriors have scored in the half since their season low of 28
against the Los Angeles Lakers on Dec. 1.
Notes: Jackson played in his 500th career game. ... The 14
first-quarter points scored by the Warriors was their second lowest
total of the season. ... Mutombo recorded his 33rd double-double of
the season. ... Marshall recorded his team-high 22nd double-double.
... The Hawks are 0-5 on Mondays.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Festival Lures Cigar Lovers  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Serenaded by 93-year-old Grammy award winner Compay Segundo,
hundreds of cigar connoisseurs from around the world lit up behind the stone
walls of a Spanish fortress as the island's second annual cigar festival got
under way.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Mostly this is a pretext to get together ... and smoke our 'habanos' in
their native land,'' said Oscar Basulto, president of the Cuban tobacco firm
Habanos S.A., using the local term for Cuban cigars.
</P>
<P>
	   And smoke they did.
</P>
<P>
	   Slim lancers by Cohiba. Long Churchills by Punch. A shortish cigar
manufactured under the lesser known Cuban brand of Ramon Allones.
</P>
<P>
	   While the tobacco aficionados puffed away under a clear night sky, Segundo
sang traditional Cuban songs and waiters in red jackets served a variety of rum
drinks with plenty of ice.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a great way for us to make business contacts and just enjoy our
cigars,'' said Peter Forman, the exclusive distributor of Cuban cigars in the
Czech Republic. ``Coming from a former communist country, we Czechs knew about
Cuban cigars a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
	   Miguel Garcia, vice president of Habanos S.A., said the gathering was
``already catching the feeling of a festival, like the International Film
Festival,'' the annual cinema fest that brings world-renowned movie stars to
Havana each December.
</P>
<P>
	   No stars were spotted among the hundreds of people gathered at the Monday
night inauguration cocktail party, but many expect at least a few famous folks
will show before the Second International Habano Festival winds up Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   President Fidel Castro, a former cigar smoker who gave up the habit years
ago, was expected to attend at least one event, depending on how busy he is with
the ongoing battle to bring 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez back to his father in Cuba
and a flap over a Cuban diplomat expelled from the United States after he was
accused of espionage.
</P>
<P>
	   An estimated 800 festival participants from 49 countries included editors of
cigar magazines, tobacco sellers and cigar connoisseurs.
</P>
<P>
	   Aside from being serenaded by traditional Afro-Cuban rhythms, participants
could expect during the five-day event to visit tobacco fields, cigar factories,
and a trade fair.
</P>
<P>
	   Nine new cigar brands were to make their debut at a final, formal dinner on
Friday at the Pabexpo convention center. Cuba's government-controlled tobacco
industry already markets 34 brands, such as Romeo y Julieta, Partagas, Monte
Cristo, and Hoyo de Monterrey.
</P>
<P>
	   Also during the $350-a-plate dinner, seven wooden humidors fashioned by
Cuban artisans and signed by Castro are to be auctioned off. Castro attended the
dinner held last year during the first international festival.
</P>
<P>
	   The festival is being held as the Cuban government celebrates one of its
best harvests in 20 years. State news reports said the 1999-2000 harvest, which
is ending now, is expected to yield 44,000 tons of tobacco. The reports did not
give statistics from previous harvests.
</P>
<P>
	   It also came weeks after the state company Habanos S.A. became a mixed
enterprise in its marketing operations after selling 50 percent of its shares to
the European firm of Altadis for $500 million. Altadis, a partnership of
Tabacalera of Spain and Seita of France, control 25 percent of the world cigar
market.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuba exported 148 million cigars last year, of which 128 million were
hand-rolled and 20 million were machine-rolled, Garcia said at a news conference
last week.
</P>
<P>
	   He said western Europe is the largest market for Cuban cigars -- accounting
for 90 million cigars, or 65.5 percent of the total. Within Europe, the biggest
consumers in 1999 were Spain, consuming 43 million cigars, and France, which
bought 17.8 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The next largest regional market is the Americas and the Caribbean, which
accounted for 18 million cigars last year. That total included cigars sold at
duty free shops in Cuba and airports throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
	   The biggest potential market for Cuban cigars -- the United States --
remains closed because of a nearly 40-year-old U.S. trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
	   Garcia estimated that 6 million Cuban cigars enter the United States each
year as contraband.

<HEADLINE> Treatment May Fight Kidney Cancer  </HEADLINE>
    By MALCOLM RITTER AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A vaccine-like treatment wiped out or shrank tumors in
patients whose kidney cancer had spread elsewhere in their bodies, according to
a new study.
</P>
<P>
	   Experts called the results striking but cautioned that the preliminary study
of only 17 patients would have to be confirmed by more work.
</P>
<P>
	   Tumors disappeared in four patients and shrank by more than half in two
others, researchers from the University of Goettingen in Germany and elsewhere
reported in the March issue of the journal Nature Medicine.
</P>
<P>
	   Cancer that has spread from the kidney is notoriously difficult to treat,
and doctors often turn to experimental therapies. In the new study, tumors in
the lung, bones, lymph nodes and elsewhere disappeared.
</P>
<P>
	   The research was aimed at revving up the immune system to attack tumors,
much as an ordinary vaccine primes the body to fight off germs. The study used
blood cells called dendritic cells, which normally trigger an immune attack by
presenting other blood cells with bits of a target germ.
</P>
<P>
	   The scientists fused millions of tumor cells from each patient to dendritic
cells from donors, then injected the hybrid cells back into the patient. These
hybrids could then alert the immune system by displaying bits of the patient's
tumor.
</P>
<P>
	   Initially, patients were injected with the vaccine twice, six weeks apart.
Those whose disease didn't progress continued to get boosters every three
months. No serious side effects appeared.
</P>
<P>
	   In three of the four patients whose tumors disappeared, it happened within
the first 12 weeks, the researchers reported.
</P>
<P>
	   "We were quite happy with how this worked," and further development may make
the treatment work better, said one study author, Dr. Rolf-Hermann Ringert of
the University of Goettingen. He said follow-up testing has already begun.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Samir Khleif, who conducts research on cancer vaccine treatments at the
National Cancer Institute, called the report encouraging. But he stressed it
must be confirmed by other researchers in studies that include more patients.
</P>
<P>
	   Few cancer vaccines so far have made tumors disappear in cases where the
disease has spread in the body, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Alan Houghton, chief of clinical immunology at the Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, said he is "cautiously optimistic."
</P>
<P>
	   One reason for caution is that cancers that spread from the kidney can
sometimes shrink on their own, which can exaggerate the effect of therapy, he
said. Another is that the strikingly high rate of tumor response in the study
may not be matched in follow-up work, as has happened with other therapies, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Dope Ingredient May Fight Cancer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Marijuana-like drugs eradicated some brain cancers in rats
and helped other animals live longer, according to a study published in the
March issue of the journal Nature Medicine.
</P>
<P>
	   The study dealt with gliomas, the most common category of cancer arising in
the brain. Gliomas are highly lethal in people despite treatment with drugs,
surgery and radiation.
</P>
<P>
	   Scientists at the Complutense and Autonoma universities in Madrid, Spain,
injected glioma cells into the brains of rats to produce tumors. Untreated rats
died within 18 days.
</P>
<P>
	   Other rats were treated with drug infusions for seven days through a tube
leading to the tumor. Fifteen rats got infusions of THC, the main active
component in marijuana. Tumors disappeared in three animals, and nine other rats
outlived the untreated ones, surviving up to 35 days.
</P>
<P>
	   When researchers used a different but similar drug, five of 15 rats became
tumor-free and four others outlived untreated animals, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Dr. Philip Gutin, chief of neurosurgery at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center in New York, said other experimental therapies work better in
rats. And the paper doesn't demonstrate that the effect came from the drugs
rather than simply the infusion of liquid into the brain, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Rolf Barth, who studies brain tumors at Ohio State University, called
the work interesting. But he said the type of glioma cells used to create the
tumors does not provide a very good mimic of the human disease.

<HEADLINE> IDG Founder Gives $350M to MIT  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) --A graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology is giving his alma mater a record $350 million to establish an
institute to study the brain.
</P>
<P>
	   Patrick J. McGovern Jr., founder of computer data publisher International
Data Group Inc., pledged the money over 20 years in what amounts to the largest
donation ever bestowed on a university.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Creation of the McGovern Institute for Brain Research will launch one of
the most profound and important scientific ventures of the next century and what
surely will be a cornerstone of MIT's scientific contributions in the decades
ahead,'' MIA President Charles Vest said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The new institute, named for McGovern and his wife, Lore Harp McGovern, will
focus on human learning and communication. It will take an interdisciplinary
approach that includes neuroscience, molecular neurobiology, bioengineering,
cognitive sciences, computation and genetics.
</P>
<P>
	   The McGoverns said they decided to give to brain research because the
discipline is on the cusp of major advances.
</P>
<P>
	   Patrick McGovern studied life sciences at MIT, where he received his
undergraduate degree in 1959. Five years later, he founded IDG, publisher of
Computerworld, The Industry Standard and PC World. He has launched more than 290
computer magazines and newspapers in 80 countries.
</P>
<P>
	   Lore Harp McGovern co-founded Vector Graphics, one of the earliest PC
companies, in 1976 and is involved with numerous startup ventures in Silicon
Valley.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Within the next 20 years, as we move into the knowledge economy, we hope
that the interdisciplinary research at the McGovern Institute will lead to
improvements in receiving, analyzing, associating, storing, retrieving and
communicating information,'' Patrick McGovern said. ``These scientific advances
will result in enhancements to the standard of living and quality of life around
the world.''
</P>
<P>
	   The McGovern Institute will be headed by Phillip A. Sharp, a molecular
biologist who received the Nobel Prize in 1993 for his discovery of surplus DNA
and his work with gene splicing.
</P>
<P>
	   The gift also allows for a team of 16 investigators, including 10 new
faculty members, each of whom will hold a joint appointment in other
departments, such as brain and cognitive science, biology or linguistics.
</P>
<P>
	   According to The Chronicle of Higher Education, the next largest gift to a
university was $300 million to Vanderbilt in 1998 from the Ingram Charitable
Fund, created by E. Bronson Ingram and Martha Ingram.
</P>
<P>
	   Microsoft's Bill Gates has given more than $1 billion to higher education,
but most of the money went toward scholarships and was not given specifically to
a university.

<HEADLINE> Alleged Cuba Spy Faces Deadline  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM COHEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TORONTO (AP) -- An alleged Cuban spy who was expelled from the United States
remained in Canada today, despite the fact that his two-day transit visa had run
out.
</P>
<P>
	   As of early today, Jose Imperatori was still inside Cuba's embassy in Ottawa
and it wasn't clear when he might leave.
</P>
<P>
	   Imperatori was detained by U.S. authorities and flown to Montreal aboard a
U.S. government plane late Saturday. He had been expected to leave Canada for
Havana on Sunday. Even his family members in Cuba said they weren't sure when he
would arrive home.
</P>
<P>
	   Imperatori's wife, Raquel Fundora, and the couple's 3-year-old son returned
to Havana from the United States late Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy said Imperatori, 46, would
become an illegal alien if he remained past the two-day limit allowed by the
visa granted upon his arrival late Saturday in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
	   Axworthy said Canada wanted no role in the latest diplomatic fracas between
Cuba and the United States, and would not specify what would happen if
Imperatori refused to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We'll have to see if the Cuban authorities live up to their
responsibilities and their basic rules and connections of diplomacy,'' Axworthy
said. ``We were simply providing a courtesy to allow him to transfer back to
Cuba, and we expect them to recognize just exactly what it was.''
</P>
<P>
	   A Cuban government statement said Imperatori was seeking permission to stay
in Canada ``for the time needed to find an honorable solution to the problem.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, Imperatori resigned his consular position, giving up his
diplomatic immunity, and said he would defy the U.S. State Department's
expulsion order so he could contest allegations linking him with U.S.
immigration official Mariano Faget, who has been charged with spying for Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   FBI officials escorted Imperatori, accompanied by his lawyer, from his
suburban Maryland apartment to the plane that flew him to Montreal on Saturday
night. The State Department said he was expelled for not voluntarily leaving by
the appointed time.
</P>
<P>
	   Imperatori may be asked to return to the United States to testify in Faget's
case, the State Department said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuba insists Imperatori's relationship with Faget was unobjectionable. It
also maintains that the Cuban diplomatic mission in Washington, where Imperatori
served, never has been used for intelligence activities.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuban officials say they believe the allegations are a smokescreen to block
the return of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy was rescued from the Florida straits in late November after his
mother and her boyfriend died, along with several other people, in an effort to
get from Cuba to the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Whether Elian should be returned to Cuba or stay with relatives in Miami has
created an international furor.

<HEADLINE> Will Feds Prosecute in Diallo Case?  </HEADLINE>
   By LINDA DEUTSCH AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The cases of Rodney King and Amadou Diallo appear to be
mirror images. In each, four white policemen attack a black man. The authorities
are acquitted, setting off protests and demands for federal intervention and
perhaps another trial.
</P>
<P>
	   King lived after his brutal beating in Los Angeles; Diallo, shot 19 times,
died. But in both cases, excess use of force is alleged. In each trial, a change
of venue may have influenced the verdict.
</P>
<P>
	   But experts say the similarities may be outweighed by enough differences to
make the demand for a federal trial charging the officers with violating
Diallo's civil rights an uphill battle.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The similarities are striking,'' said Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional
law professor at the University of Southern California. ``But there are some
major differences. One is that you don't have the same degree of public outrage
as in Rodney King. The political pressure here was enormous. There had been a
riot.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Then there is the question of whether federal prosecutors think they can
win the case that was lost in state court, whether they can prove an intentional
violation of civil rights.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, Justice Department officials were reviewing the Diallo case
for a possible federal civil rights trial. Attorneys for the officers have
called for a speedy decision.
</P>
<P>
	   Loyola Law School Professor Laurie Levenson said prosecutors must show the
officers intended to use force they knew was unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 1992 King case, officers were videotaped beating, kicking and
stomping King after chasing him down for speeding on a freeway. A stun gun was
used on him at one point.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial was moved out of Los Angeles to the predominantly white city of
Simi Valley in neighboring Ventura County. The officers were acquitted on most
state charges by a jury that had no black members. Rioting broke out; 54 people
died and sections of Los Angeles burned.
</P>
<P>
	   By the time a federal grand jury indicted the officers, new evidence had
surfaced that police reports were altered, that the officers had boasted about
the beating and that the bloodied victim was driven to the police station to be
shown off as a trophy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They had new evidence in the federal trial,'' Levenson noted.
</P>
<P>
	   King, who suffered major injuries, was also alive to tell his story from the
witness stand, along with witnesses who did not testify in state court.
</P>
<P>
	   Two of the officers were convicted and sentenced to prison. Two were
acquitted.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Diallo case, officers fired 41 shots at the unarmed West African
immigrant in the early hours of Feb. 4, 1999, in the narrow vestibule of his New
York City apartment house.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial was moved out of the Bronx to Albany in upstate New York, where a
racially mixed jury decided the case. The four officers testified that they felt
their lives were in danger when Diallo reached for something that turned out to
be his wallet. One of them wept on the stand as he recalled the mistake.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The real question is did they believe they had the right to shoot,'' said
Levenson. ``We give great leeway to police officers in defending themselves.
Forty-one shots is not necessarily unreasonable. ... If it was just bad police
work or mistaken identity, that's not enough to prove willful intent.''
</P>
<P>
	   She also said federal civil rights prosecutions following state acquittals
are extremely rare, and that the U.S. Justice Department often looks for a flaw
in the state prosecution before recommending a new trial.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There has to be some sense that the system didn't work in state court,''
said attorney Harland Braun, who represented one of the policemen in the federal
King trial.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1991, federal prosecutors took on a New York case that did not involve
police actions. A black man who had been acquitted in state court was convicted
in a federal trial for his part in the stabbing death of a Jewish scholar during
race riots in Brooklyn's Crown Heights section.
</P>
<P>
	   Lemrick Nelson Jr. was sentenced to 19 1/2 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The law allowing such trials dates to 1909 and was intended to protect
former slaves against acts of violence by public officials. Over the years,
federal authorities often brought civil rights cases in the deep South when they
felt that local officials or juries had failed to pursue equal justice for black
defendants.
</P>
<P>
	   But no racial component is required for the civil rights charges and none
was alleged in the King case.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics have said that duplicate prosecutions of the same defendants
constitute double jeopardy. But Chemerinsky said the law is clear on that issue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The U.S. Supreme Court has said that the state and federal governments are
independent sovereigns and can bring their own cases,'' he said. ``But it
doesn't happen very often.''

<HEADLINE> Yanks' Strawberry Suspended 1 Year  </HEADLINE>
    By BEN WALKER AP Baseball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A third strike for cocaine landed Darryl Strawberry a
one-year suspension Monday, and left the New York Yankees and most of baseball
wondering: Will he ever play again?
</P>
<P>
	   Commissioner Bud Selig imposed the penalty and did not make any provision
for the troubled slugger, who turns 38 next month, to return early for good
behavior.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This was a very difficult and painful decision for me to make,'' Selig
said. ``The meeting I had with Darryl and his wife, Charisse, last Tuesday was
an emotional experience for all of us. I had no doubt that his remorse and
sorrow were genuine, and I worried about the effect my decision would have on
his health and the welfare of his family.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the end, I could not ignore Darryl's past infractions and concluded
that each of us must be held accountable for his or her actions. I am hopeful
that he will use this time away from the game productively and will care for
himself and his family.''
</P>
<P>
	   Strawberry has not been at Legends Field since baseball ordered him out of
the spring training complex last Wednesday, a day after his latest failed drug
test became public.
</P>
<P>
	   His pinstriped uniform still hangs in his clubhouse locker, plus there's a
batting helmet and spikes. There's also a stack of mail, though there's no
telling when he'll ever get to pick it up.
</P>
<P>
	   Strawberry, an eight-time All-Star, had been expected to be the prime
designated hitter for the two-time World Series champions this season at a
salary of $750,000. Instead, his third cocaine-related suspension from baseball
in five years left his future in doubt.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Bud just told me,'' Yankees owner George Steinbrenner said when he left
the ballpark after an intrasquad game. ``We will abide by the decision. I feel
badly for Darryl. My hopes and prayers are that he can do the things he needs to
do to get his life in order.''
</P>
<P>
	   Said manager Joe Torre, shortly before the penalty was made public: ``You
don't have to condone what he's done to have a feeling for him. He's not a bad
person.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think you're always concerned. Obviously, it's a tough thing he's going
through. He's fallen off here a couple of times,'' he said. ``Sure, it's easy to
say he's suspended. But what happens to him during this time?''
</P>
<P>
	   Said second baseman Chuck Knoblauch: ``All you have is hope you wake up and
get through the day clean. Hopefully, the days will roll up.''
</P>
<P>
	   The players' union does not appear likely to challenge the ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   Strawberry is a career .259 hitter with 335 home runs and 1,000 RBIs, and a
legacy of tape-measure shots. The NL Rookie of the Year with the New York Mets
in 1983, his power seemed to have him headed to the Hall of Fame early in his
career before multiple setbacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Legal trouble slowed him while drug and alcohol problems almost derailed
him. He had stays in the Smithers Center and the Betty Ford Center and then,
during the 1998 playoffs, he was diagnosed with colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   Strawberry returned last season and hit .327 with three homers and six RBIs
in 24 games. He hit .333 (5-for-15) with two home runs in the postseason,
showing the easy swing that made him so dangerous.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's got to be a tough thing, because I'm sure baseball was one of the
things he was able to use to fight this,'' Yankees third baseman Scott Brosius
said. ``Now, he's losing the ability to come to the park, and not only work a
job, but to cheer for guys who cheer for him. There's a support thing there that
may not be there on an everyday basis.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Yankees, meanwhile, must decide how to fill the left-handed DH spot
Strawberry was supposed to occupy. Chili Davis, the team's top designated hitter
last season, has retired.
</P>
<P>
	   Yankees DHs hit a combined .275 with 23 home runs and 84 RBIs last year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not in a reactionary mode because of Darryl's suspension,'' general
manager Brian Cashman said. ``Do I think we have the bats on our roster to at
least duplicate that? Yes, I do.''
</P>
<P>
	   Torre has talked about using Tino Martinez, Bernie Williams, Paul O'Neill
and Jorge Posada in the slot during their off-days, and Tim Raines is back in
camp as a non-roster player.
</P>
<P>
	   There's also the chance the Yankees might make a deal. In fact, the front
office began discussing trade possibilities once Strawberry's problem became
known.
</P>
<P>
	   Anaheim's Darin Erstad and Jim Edmonds and Cincinnati's Dmitri Young are
among the players rumored to move.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's always going to be speculation,'' Cashman said. ``If something
presents itself that would help improve the team, we'll look at it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Strawberry's options, however, are more limited. He could perhaps return to
the independent Northern League, where he played for two months in the summer of
1996.
</P>
<P>
	   It's doubtful he could go to Japan, where 1999 All-Stars Tony Fernandez and
Dave Nilsson will play this season. More than a decade ago, Steve Howe was not
allowed to try out for the Seibu Lions because of past drug problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Strawberry was suspended in 1995 for 60 days following a positive test for
cocaine use. In 1999, Selig banned him again from April 24 to Aug. 4 after
Strawberry was arrested for cocaine possession and soliciting a prostitute.
</P>
<P>
	   Strawberry later pleased no contest to the charges and was undergoing
regular drug tests as part of his legal punishment. His Jan. 19 test came back
positive and led to the latest penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   Given Strawberry's age, it's unclear if he ever will return to the game that
made him famous.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's sad,'' Yankees outfielder Ricky Ledee said before the announcement.
``Being older, if it's a one-year suspension, my guess is it would be tough.''

<HEADLINE> Fringe Group, Nation of Islam Ally  </HEADLINE>
   By MARTHA IRVINE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Jewish community leaders were hoping for an apology from the
man who once called Judaism a ``gutter religion.''
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, they say Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan has slammed them
again by affiliating with a tiny Orthodox Jewish group that opposes the state of
Israel. Among other things, its leaders say the Holocaust was punishment for
Zionist Jews who called for the establishment of an Israeli state.
</P>
<P>
	   Farrakhan made little reference to Judaism during his annual Saviours' Day
speech on Sunday. But he invited Rabbi Yisroel Dovid Weiss, a spokesman for a
group known as the Neturei Karta International, to address the crowd of more
than 20,000 in Chicago's United Center.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Nation of Islam leaders held a news conference and Weiss repeated
his belief that most people who claim to be Jews are not Jews.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's Zionism, not Judaism,'' Weiss said. ``They are something which is an
abomination to God. It is a heresy to God.''
</P>
<P>
	   Israel is considered a heresy by the Neturei Karta because the group
believes a Jewish state can arise only with the arrival of the Messiah. The
movement is comprised of several dozen orthodox Jewish clans in Israel as well
as backers in the United States and Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
	   Farrakhan did not attend Monday's news conference. But his chief of staff,
Leonard Muhammad, said he was grateful that the Neturei Karta sought out the
Nation of Islam last year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We would hope other Jews might choose to do the same thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But many Jewish leaders and groups said they considered the Nation of
Islam's affiliation with the Neturei Karta yet another insult.
</P>
<P>
	   Rabbi Ira Youdovin, executive director of the Chicago Board of Rabbis, was
stunned at Farrakhan's decision to invite a group that he said is ``about as far
off the screen in Jewish life as they can possibly be.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``He hasn't mended any fences with 99.99 percent of the Jewish community,''
Youdovin said of Farrakhan. ``But it looks good on television, doesn't it?''
</P>
<P>
	   The Nation of Islam newspaper The Final Call ran a full-page spread of
photos of a smiling Farrakhan meeting with members of the Neturei Karta last
fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Harlan Loeb, Midwest civil rights director for the Anti-Defamation League,
called the Neturei Karta ``a profound embarrassment on the mosaic of the Jewish
community, '' and called Farrakhan insincere.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What good is it for Farrakhan to say, 'We're aligned with Jews, but the
Jews we're aligned with are those who share our disdain for Zionism?''' Loeb
asked.
</P>
<P>
	   Muhammad would not comment directly on whether he agreed with the Neturei
Karta's view.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't see ourselves entering into being responsible for choosing who is
a Jew. That's up to God,'' Muhammad said. He rejected criticism over affiliating
with a group that many consider controversial.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Regardless of who these gentlemen represent and what they are, at least
they're willing to come and talk and be civil,'' Muhammad said. ``You haven't
seen them demonstrating against us saying, 'Death to Farrakhan.' ... Other
groups did that.''
</P>
<P>
	   Many Jewish leaders said it would be up to the Nation of Islam to make the
first move -- namely by repudiating past comments. If that happened, Youdovin
said, he would still be willing to work with the Nation of Islam.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I might lose my job for saying so,'' Youdovin said. ``But the Nation of
Islam does a lot of good work in the black community, too.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a frustration not being able to participate with them.''
</P>
<P>
	   Youdovin said he also hoped that leaders in the orthodox Muslim community
whom Farrakhan has been wooing -- namely W. Deen Mohammed -- might help bring
the Nation of Islam and Jewish leaders together.
</P>
<P>
	   Mohammed, head of the black orthodox Muslim American Society and the son of
late Nation of Islam leader Elijah Muhammad, made short remarks at Sunday's
speech but did not address the Neturei Karta's stance. He did not return a
message left Monday.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Hits Agent Hard in Fraud Case  </HEADLINE>
    By EDDIE PELLS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Wearing handcuffs and leg shackles, sports agent
Tank Black began the process of trying to prove himself innocent of cheating NFL
players out of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. government and Black's attorneys made their first public
presentations Monday in the criminal fraud and money laundering case.
</P>
<P>
	   In a 20-page indictment unsealed by U.S. Magistrate Gary R. Jones, the
government accuses Black and four employees of defrauding several former NFL
clients, including former Florida stars Fred Taylor, Ike Hilliard, Reidel
Anthony and Jacquez Green.
</P>
<P>
	   The accusations nearly duplicate those levied against Black by the
Securities and Exchange Commission in a civil case filed last week. The SEC
accused Black of defrauding athletes of $5 million in a period of four years.
</P>
<P>
	   The criminal case carries a sentence of up to 25 years in jail.
</P>
<P>
	   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Sanford asked that Black be held without bond
pending his arraignment next Monday, saying the agent was a risk to flee the
country.
</P>
<P>
	   Sanford claimed Black took an April 1998 trip to Jamaica with two fugitive
drug dealers from Detroit. The prosecutor claims Black took another trip to Rio
De Janeiro two months earlier with two purported drug dealers to buy property in
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
	   "If Mr. Black has a history of assisting fugitives between countries, we
have a strong belief he would be a risk to flee himself," Sanford told Jones.
</P>
<P>
	   Jones ordered a detention hearing Thursday and released Black in the custody
of his attorney, Peter George of Tampa.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Sanford and George refused comment to reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Normally outspoken in his own defense, Black stood stoically for the
90-minute hearing, speaking only to his lawyers. He left the courtroom without
comment. His only show of emotion came when Sanford asked for the detention
hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those attending the preliminary hearing were Black's wife, his pastor
and the stepfather of NBA star Vince Carter, who last week said he still
supported the embattled agent.
</P>
<P>
	   Black gained control of money paid to the players by their NFL teams,
funneled it into accounts and then used it for his own benefit, the indictment
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, Taylor accused Black of cheating him of nearly $3 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The indictment lists two payments -- one of $2.4 million, another of
$650,000 -- from Taylor's account at Black's agency to accounts in the Cayman
Islands that the government contends were used to launder the money.
</P>
<P>
	   Taylor was one of more than a dozen clients who invested a total of $12.5
million and $14 million, Sanford said.
</P>
<P>
	   Black, with the help of runner Alfred Twitty, recruited the players to his
agency by offering them money before their college eligibility was complete, the
indictment said.
</P>
<P>
	   Also indicted were Black's attorney, Jim Franklin; Twitty and employees
Linda Wilson and Lisa Adams.
</P>
<P>
	   Adams also appeared Monday and pleaded innocent.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida authorities have filed a sworn complaint against Black, accusing him
of unlicensed agent activity in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those in the gallery Monday was state prosecutor Bill Cervone, who has
been delaying action on the state case to see what federal prosecutors do.
</P>
<P>
	   "This puts our case on hold for a while," Cervone said.

<HEADLINE> America's Cup Race 4 Abandoned  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- The America's Cup schedule is being juggled to
try and get some sailing done.
</P>
<P>
	Race 4 was abandoned for the second time due to lack of wind on Tuesday,
prompting organizers, the two teams and TV rights holders to agree to try again
on Wednesday, scheduled as a lay day.
</P>
<P>
	All this bobbing around on the Hauraki Gulf, which these days more resembles a
tranquil mill pond, is starting to wear on more than just the sailors aboard
Team New Zealand's Black Magic and Italy's Luna Rossa.
</P>
<P>
	``We're getting bored out there, too,'' race committee chairman Harold Bennett
said. ``I think that is a problem. We want a race as much as the sailors do.''
</P>
<P>
	The best action on the water Tuesday was when a man in a motorized rubber boat
pulled his terrier on a boogie board through the spectator fleet.
</P>
<P>
	The forecast for Wednesday calls for tropical rain storms with winds of 12-15
knots from the northeast. Race 5 in the best-of-9 series, which Black Magic
leads 3-0, will remain scheduled for Thursday, when the wind could build to
20-25 knots.
</P>
<P>
	``We've had some good sailing days when we're not sailing, and today another
day of no breeze where we should be sailing,'' Bennett said. ``But the prospects
from here look a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
	Organizers said earlier that they didn't plan to race on lay days because they
were part of the schedule dictated by TV rights holders.
</P>
<P>
	But with the Hauraki Gulf held hostage by a high-pressure system, four racing
days have been lost to windless days, one more day than there has been racing.
With four lay days up to this point, the regatta's momentum has been stripped
away.
</P>
<P>
	And there hasn't been much drama on the water, with Black Magic routing Luna
Rossa in all three races, with no margin closer than 1 minute, 17 seconds. That
was in the opener, which also was delayed by lack of wind.
</P>
<P>
	Bennett said discussions about racing on lay days began on Monday, and that
negotiating took place today. With TV contracts involved, ``I know there were
telephone calls flying all over the world from about midday today, to see
whether this was in fact possible.
</P>
<P>
	The boats haven't raced since Saturday. Race 4 originally was scheduled for
Sunday, but there wasn't enough wind.
</P>
<P>
	The wind actually has been pretty decent on a few of the lay days, including an
average of almost 10 knots Monday, according to New Zealand's weather service.
</P>
<P>
	Bennett said that despite appearances, this isn't the wrong time of year to be
racing in the Hauraki Gulf.
</P>
<P>
	``We do generally get a lot of good sea breezes,'' Bennett said. ``But the
weather pattern we're experiencing this year is a little different than what
we've seen for the last number of years. I wouldn't say it's the wrong time of
year, we've just struck a bad patch.''
</P>
<P>
	The high pressure results in sunny days that are good for sea breezes, but the
southwesterly breeze from the Tasman Sea meets the northeasterly from the
Pacific in the gulf, and they cancel each other out.
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, supermodel Rachel Hunter, a Kiwi and the former wife of Rod
Stewart, came over on a chase boat for a chat with the crew of Black Magic, who
earlier ate ice cream bars as they shielded themselves from the summer sun.
</P>
<P>
	The crew on Team New Zealand's backup boat let teen-agers climb aboard and
swing off ropes into the water.
</P>
<P>
	Some of the sailors aboard Luna Rossa read Italian newspapers as they lounged
on deck, repeating a scene all to familiar in this America's Cup.

Russian Journalist Released
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- Radio Liberty correspondent Andrei Babitsky, whose detention
by Russian forces in Chechnya sparked protest inside Russia and abroad, was
freed from custody early Tuesday, Russian media reported. The move came less
than a day after acting President Vladimir Putin publicly questioned the
Interior Ministry's handling of the case and suggested that there was
insufficient reason to keep the reporter in detention. Babitsky, whose reporting
from the rebel side in Chechnya had angered Russian officials, was detained in
Chechnya in January and turned over to rebels in exchange for captured Russian

Study Cites Hate Groups on I-5

	   SEATTLE (AP) -- White supremacist groups are flourishing along the populous
Interstate 5 corridor in Washington and Oregon, recruiting suburban young people
who feel their culture is threatened, the Northwest Coalition for Human Dignity
said Monday. In its first annual "Hate by State" report, the coalition that
monitors hate groups drew a regional map, using iron crosses as symbols, showing
52 white supremacist groups. They range from several chapters of the World
Church of the Creator and other religious entities to Ku Klux Klan, and neo-Nazi
organizations to militias.

Mad Cow Disease Detected in Denmark
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- A case of mad cow disease has been reported in
northern Denmark, the government said today. The 4-year-old cow was immediately
slaughtered while the rest of the 70-head milk herd was put under observation.
The animal, which was born and bred in Denmark, was slaughtered in late January
because it suffered from spasms -- symptoms of bovine spongiform encephalopathy,
or mad cow disease, said Flemming Thune-Stephensen, a veterinarian with the meat
industry's livestock agency. The cow's head was sent to laboratories in Denmark
and Britain, which confirmed it had the disease.

Monday. The effort includes training for border police and law enforcement
officials and help in establishing national drug control agencies and policies,

McCain, Bush Trade Barbs

Democrats, John McCain said Monday he was instead trying to expand the GOP to
become "a party as big as the country we serve." Republican presidential rival
George W. Bush strongly disagreed, saying of McCain, "He is a person who
obviously wants to divide people into camps." The comments followed McCain's
speech here -- in the headquarters city of Pat Robertson's Christian Coalition
-- accusing some in his party of pandering to Christian right leaders "on the
outer reaches of American politics."

Tobacco Maker Discussing Gov't Regulation

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Philip Morris Co., the nation's largest tobacco producer,
is willing to negotiate over government regulation of the industry, according to
a company official. Senior vice president Steven Parrish discussed the concept
with both The Wall Street Journal and Washington Post. He said a formal
announcement would come Thursday. Parrish said he has met in recent weeks with
several lawmakers of both parties to discuss the company's "willingness to open
up a dialogue and look at the right regulatory approach," once the Supreme Court

   TOKYO (AP) -- Japan and the United States have agreed to send a
team of researchers to Cambodia to intensify the fight against AIDS
and other infectious diseases, officials of the two countries said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative was one of six proposed at an annual meeting of
senior officials to promote cooperation between the two economic
powers in solving global problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''In terms of urgency and seriousness, the infectious-diseases
program for Cambodia is extremely important not just for that
country but also as a base of activities for the wider region,''
said Japanese Deputy Foreign Minister Yoshiji Nogami, who
co-chaired the meeting.
</P>

percent of them live in developing countries, according to a
statement released by the two governments. Japan and the U.S. have
already collaborated on AIDS-related projects in the Philippines,
Thailand and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS prevention is part of a shared agenda of global initiatives
that the two countries adopted in 1993.
</P>
<P>

proportions but also is an issue that belongs on a development
agenda and a security agenda,'' said U.S. Under Secretary of State
for Global Affairs Frank Loy.

<HEADLINE> Diabetes Reversed in Mice  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Scientists have reversed diabetes in mice by
generating insulin-producing cells in a laboratory and
transplanting them into the animals, an indication of how useful
so-called stem cells might be.
</P>
<P>
   The mice had a version of Type 1 diabetes, which occurs when the
body mistakenly destroys insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.
People with this disease must inject themselves with insulin daily
to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Patients have been treated with transplants of islets, the
insulin factories of the pancreas. But the success rate has been
low, apparently in part because it's hard to get enough islets from
a cadaver's pancreas.
</P>
<P>
   The new work suggests a way to overcome that problem: prodding
immature stem cells from the pancreas to make abundant quantities
of islets in the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The mouse study by researchers at the University of Florida
College of Medicine and elsewhere is reported in the March issue of
the journal Nature Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   In one set of experiments, eight diabetic mice received the
lab-generated islets and then were weaned from insulin injections
over a few days. Within a week after injections stopped, they
showed a decline in blood-sugar levels. They remained healthy
without insulin injections until they were killed for examination
of the implant, a period of up to 55 days from implantation.

<HEADLINE> Oscars To Include 'Blame Canada'  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN, AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Fans of ''South Park'' will have a ready-made
enemy to vilify if the animated film fails to win the Oscar for
best song. They can blame Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The movie ''South Park: Bigger, Longer &AMP; Uncut'' mocked just
about all creeds, races and nationalities, but the main targets of
its crude humor were Canadians.
</P>
<P>
   ''Blame Canada,'' a song in which American parents fault the
nation to the north for their own potty-mouthed children, scored a
victory for crudity when it received an Oscar nomination for best
original song.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, a solid hit with $52 million at theaters last summer,
also was the latest tongue-in-cheek jab the movie industry has
taken at the speech, appearance, mannerisms and lifestyle of
Canadians.
</P>
<P>
   Its nomination also comes in a year when Canadian-born actors
Jim Carrey and Christopher Plummer delivered acclaimed performances
that were passed over by Oscar voters.
</P>
<P>
   Notable past film forays include Michael Moore's comedy
''Canadian Bacon,'' about a faltering U.S. president who initiates
a cold war with Canada, and ''Strange Brew,'' starring Dave Thomas
and Rick Moranis as ''hosers'' Doug and Bob McKenzie, Canadian
brothers in bulky parkas and ski hats on a perpetual search for the
next beer or hockey game.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was definitely a Bob and Doug fan when I was a kid,'' said
''South Park'' co-creator Trey Parker, who co-wrote ''Blame
Canada.'' ''That was more Canadians making fun of Canadians,
though, where we're Americans making fun of Canadians, which really
sort of ticks people off more.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Canadians are just so defensive. That's what makes them so fun
to make fun of.''
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, children begin spewing profanity after sneaking in
to see an obscenity-laden movie by Canadian comics Terrance and
Phillip. Enraged parents whip up anti-Canadian sentiment, Terrance
and Phillip are sentenced to death and bloody war breaks out.
</P>
<P>
   The American parents sing:
</P>
<P>
   ''No! Blame Canada, Blame Canada!
</P>
<P>
   With all their beady little eyes and flapping heads so full of
lies.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It sums up one of the basic points of the movie, which is
people blaming everyone but themselves for the raising of their
children,'' said ''Blame Canada'' co-writer Marc Shaiman.
</P>
<P>
   Canadians are drawn with beady eyes and flapping heads. The
Canadian ambassador is scorned by other diplomats when he
pronounces ''about'' as ''aboot.'' Canadians living in the United
States are herded into camps, and Army recruitment is aided by the
slogan ''Kill some Canadian scum.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyette Dore of the National Film Board of Canada said Canadians
took it all in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ''We kind of smiled and took it with a bit of a chuckle,'' Dore
said. ''It was clear from reading the words of the song that it's
done in jest.''
</P>
<P>
   If Canadians are at all bothered by this year's Oscars, it's
because ''The Hurricane'' by Canadian director Norman Jewison fared
poorly, Dore said. The movie has a single nomination, best actor
for Denzel Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Canada did score a coup in the short animated film category,
with four of the five nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Besides ''Blame Canada,'' the song nominees are Diane Warren's
''Music of My Heart'' from ''Music of the Heart''; Aimee Mann's
''Save Me'' from ''Magnolia''; Randy Newman's ''When She Loved Me''
from ''Toy Story 2''; and Phil Collins' ''You'll Be in My Heart''
from ''Tarzan.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the nominated songs are traditionally performed on the
Oscar telecast.
</P>
<P>
   With just one four-letter word, ''Blame Canada'' will be easy to
edit for the broadcast, Shaiman said. Other ''South Park'' songs
would have been difficult or impossible to edit for television,
including Terrance and Phillip's ditty about a certain uncle, whose
lyrics are mostly expletives.
</P>
<P>
   ''A bleeped version would have way more bleeps than words,''
Parker said.

<HEADLINE> Study Urges Pre-Processed Beef Test  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER, AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Up to half the cattle in the nation's
feedlots, far more than previously thought, are infected with
deadly bacteria, the government said today.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers using new testing methods found E. coli O157:H7
present in rates varying from 1 percent in the winter months to as
much as 50 percent in the summer. Previously, government scientists
had thought the infection rate to be no more than about 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Cattle are exposed to the bacteria from manure in feedlots.
</P>
<P>
   The new figures were developed by the Agriculture Department's
Agricultural Research Service and presented at a public session
sponsored by USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service.
</P>
<P>
   The study concluded that chances of E. coli getting into ground
beef could be reduced by testing cattle hides and carcasses before
the meat is processed. Testing now is done after the beef is
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups agree that the government needs to require far
more extensive testing of cattle and beef to prevent people from
being exposed to the germs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The prevalence figures are much higher than we ever heard
before,'' said Caroline Smith DeWaal of the Center for Science in
the Public Interest.
</P>
<P>
   Research done at a dozen packing plants last fall found the
bacteria on 3.56 percent of the hides that were sampled and 0.44
percent of the carcasses. All the bacteria on the sample carcasses
were eventually removed through steam pasteurization, hot water or
organic acid rinses, the treatments typically used in packing
plants.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is our hope that this data will encourage USDA to
re-evaluate its ground-beef sampling program,'' said James H.
Hodges, president of the American Meat Industry Foundation, which
sponsored the research. ''A carcass testing program for E. coli
O157:H7 is more practicable and will help ensure that the safest
and most wholesome product possible enters commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   Samples in the industry study were taken at a rate of 1 per 300
carcasses.
</P>
<P>
   E. coli O157 can cause serious illness and sometimes death,
especially in children and the elderly. Symptoms include chills and
bloody diarrhea. The bacteria are destroyed by adequately cooking
the meat.
</P>
<P>
   The infection rate in beef being ground in packing plants is
less than 0.05 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The ground-beef testing program, which was started after tainted
hamburger killed several children in Washington state in 1993, ''is
not systematic, and provides inadequate coverage,'' DeWaal said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Like throwing darts at a dart board, although the government
hits the target occasionally, it is clearly missing a lot of the
problem,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government recently approved the use of irradiation
to treat raw meat, but it is unclear yet whether consumers will
react to that.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, scientists are working on additional methods of
treatment. One of those is an anti-microbial agent, known as
lactoferrin, that is a naturally occurring protein in the milk of
mammals.
</P>
<P>
   Laboratory research, which was being presented at today's USDA
meeting, showed that lactoferrin was effective against more than 30
different kinds of harmful bacteria, including E. coli, salmonella
and campylobacter. Lactoferrin does not change the taste, flavor,
color or appearance of meat and isn't harmful to humans, the
researchers aid.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have borrowed a page from Mother Nature,'' said A.S. Naidu,
a medical microbiologist at California State Polytechnic
University-Pomona, where the treatment was developed. ''We have
taken a natural compound with anti-microbial properties and
discovered a way to make it work on meat surfaces to provide a
protective barrier against harmful bacteria.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials say the treatment could be useful if it is
shown to be effective in packing plants.

<HEADLINE> Pricey Hobo Styles at Dior  </HEADLINE>
By SUZY PATTERSON, AP Fashion Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Expensive hobo looks still abound at Christian Dior
and designer John Galliano proved that Tuesday, showing many jagged
hems and knotted bits of good fabric for the fall-winter boutique
collection.
</P>
<P>
   Things weren't quite as drastic as the torn-up jobs based on
bums' rags shown for spring haute couture, but there wasn't much
that would obviously sell in the boutique.
</P>
<P>
   If you like the short and sexy leopard-skin style, there are
short asymmetrical ocelot print dresses, maybe topped with a tiny
green ostrich-skin mini-bolero.
</P>
<P>
   A fitted light blue ostrich-skin short coat worn with matching
blue high-heeled boots was a plus for this mixed collection. Jean
ideas in denim blue fabrics with tie-dyed effects looked rather
good in sequined long pants.
</P>
<P>
   Logos galore came out, quite handsome in a good trench coat, hat
and bag.
</P>
<P>
   Real Galliano fans can buy boleros, shirts, skirts and even
bikinis in newsprint prints with the designer's portrait for the
''Dior Daily'' right next to a replica of the International Herald
Tribune -- a sample of the designer's English sense of irony.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly nude items came out in pretty lace over bikini panties.
One model wore her Dior beaded evening bag on a strap across the
bosom.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dior dresser doesn't have to stay out in the cold. She
can swaddle herself in one of the voluminous mink, Persian lamb,
Mongolian lamb or raccoon coats and jackets -- some in attractive
shades of ruby or Bordeaux.
</P>
<P>
   Valentino's collection was just about perfect, in a
sophisticated ladylike way. This designer doesn't dip into the
outrageous or even take chances, and that's the way his fans like
it.
</P>
<P>
   The collection is billed ''boutique,'' or luxury ready-to-wear,
but it's more haute couture, with all the lace, fine finish and
embroidery.
</P>
<P>
   He led off with lovely bold herringbone tweed suits in black or
brown, with graceful, flared knee-length skirts. Lean trouser
suits, sometimes flower-embroidered on hems, and mink collars on
dark brown skirt suits set the daytime tone.
</P>
<P>
   The ladies who lunch should be thrilled with novelties like the
pretty olive wool suit with sunburst welt seaming on the jacket.
The tricolored full short coat -- beige and sky blue with lavender
piping -- is a masterpiece of abstract geometric art, if not quite
in Mondrian colors.
</P>
<P>
   There's a bonanza for gala evenings, from Valentino's bright red
dresses with soft chiffon flounces down the back to a snazzy gold
leather suit, and many sequined flowing trouser suits or evening
gowns.
</P>
<P>
   Animal lovers have long adored Jean-Charles de Castelbajac. His
show on a 19th century balcony in the Botanical Gardens was a
lovely tribute to nature. The models, with many animal patterns on
shirts, sweaters and dresses, lined up near the stuffed elephants
and giraffes of the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Wonderful German shepherds came out in red turtleneck sweaters.
Some dogs were playing cards, while others looked intellectual with
sunglasses on.
</P>
<P>
   But the human animal did well too, as models were shown in some
fun and colorful knit sweaters, skirts and pants. Castelbajac mixed
up leather and tartans in lively dresses with plaid panels.
</P>
<P>
   The huge thatched cottage or triple-pelt furred effect on
shoulders could be omitted, but the long quilted fake fur skirts,
rustic tops and cable-knit tops with long net skirts are great fun.
</P>
<P>
   Vuitton's collection by Marc Jacobs should be a commercial hit,
as usual. The American designer seems at ease in moving a
prestigious French image of luggage into hip, luxury ready-to-wear.
</P>
<P>
   The soft tweedy short-skirted or pants-coordinated daytime
outfits looked sleek in oatmeal shades with blouses with pyramid
figures. A soft vermeil cowl-collared top looked great with its
tweed skirt.
</P>
<P>
   Leather trouser suits were luscious too, lean and well-cut.
</P>
<P>
   Berets in many colors were everywhere for a French touch. The
Parisienne style also came out in French blue alligator coats, or a
beautiful satin coat, with its beret and high-heeled pumps.
</P>
<P>
   For evening, the brown-yellow sequined short dresses, blouson
tops and tunic-pants outfits made a bow to Vuitton's old colors,
but looked sparkling new.

<HEADLINE> National Gallery Gets Two Paintings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The National Gallery of Art said Tuesday it
has received two major 20th century American paintings as gifts.
</P>
<P>
   One, Charles Sheeler's ''Classic Landscape'' is a famous image
of the Ford River Rouge plant near Detroit. The other, Arthur
Dove's ''Moon,'' illustrates the painter's role as a pioneer of
abstract art drawn from nature.
</P>
<P>
   They are part of the collection of Mrs. and Mrs. Barney Ebsworth
of St. Louis that goes on show at the gallery Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The collection will be on view through June 11 at the gallery
and at the Seattle Art Museum, Aug. 10 through Nov. 12.
</P>
<P>
   The Ebsworth collection covers American art since 1913 --
paintings, sculpture and drawings. It includes works from such
leading figures as Georgia O'Keeffe, Alexander Calder, Andy Warhol
and Edward Hopper. Ebsworth, a wealthy businessman who has retired
from the travel industry, has been collecting art for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   He is a member of the gallery's Trustees' Council. The Ebsworths
have given the gallery two other works in the past, and have made a
partial and promised gift of another, by O'Keeffe.

<HEADLINE> AP Reviews Kurt Weill Opera  </HEADLINE>
By MARY CAMPBELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- ''The Eternal Road,'' Kurt Weill's gigantic and
now almost forgotten opera of the history of the Jews, is back in
New York, 63 years after it was last staged in this city or
anywhere else. The production is unsentimental and ultimately
moving.
</P>
<P>
   Weill, Germany's greatest popular composer of the 20th century,
is better known for ''The Three Penny Opera'' and its most famous
song, ''Mack the Knife,'' than for ''The Eternal Road,'' the epic
he composed for Austrian novelist Franz Werfel's libretto.
</P>
<P>
   But with the hindsight of the Holocaust, the work composed just
after Hitler's rise to power takes on an eerie prescience in its
retelling of Jewish history against a backdrop of European
anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Eternal Road'' ran for 18 weeks in New York in 1937 before
being mothballed as too long (four hours) and big (130 performers)
to be produced. Now, to honor the centenary of Weill's birth, it
has been staged by the Chemnitz Opera in Germany, which brought its
production to the Brooklyn Academy of Music for six performances
beginning Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Eternal Road,'' with same cast size but half an hour
shorter, opens in a synagogue where the Jewish men of the town,
mindful that the Jewish populace is to be expelled at dawn, have
gathered to spend one last night together.
</P>
<P>
   A 13-year-old boy comes in with his father, a doctor and
non-practicing Jew. The boy is frightened. To calm him, the rabbi
explains that learning the history of the Jews will prepare him for
taking the road -- an eternal road -- that begins at dawn.
</P>
<P>
   The story then moves through various biblical episodes -- Abraham
and the near-sacrifice of his son Isaac, Joseph sold off by his
half-brothers, Moses, King David. The staging does a deft job of
weaving together the Bible stories and the contemporary scene in
the synagogue. A gentile woman comes in, wanting to be with the
Jewish man she loves. She becomes the title character in the book
of Ruth, the Bible's most famous convert to Judaism. The music of
mother-in-law Naomi's long aria would fit seamlessly into ''The
Three Penny Opera.'' Elsewhere the music has the religious feel of
a Handel oratorio.
</P>
<P>
   An especially moving aria is sung by Moses, begging God to
change his mind and let him enter the Promised Land. David also is
portrayed as strongly human, especially when he carries his beloved
Bathsheba through the synagogue singing a deeply committed song to
her and to God.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end, a lengthy scene with the prophets tends to sag,
but the dramatic momentum is regained at the denouement, when
soldiers burst into the synagogue telling the Jews to leave. The
cynic in the congregation turns out to be the hero. The 13-year-old
boy is spotlighted as the promise of the future, ending the opera
on a more upbeat note than in the 1937 production. Then the Jews
filed out of the synagogue to their likely doom; this time they
remain in the synagogue, singing.
</P>
<P>
   John Mauceri, an American, conducted the 80-piece orchestra.
Director Michael Heinicke is German and set and costume designer
David Sharir is Israeli.

<HEADLINE> 'Wild Party' Closing April 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- And then there was one.
</P>
<P>
   The off-Broadway version of ''The Wild Party,'' one of two
musicals this season based on the same Jazz Age poem, will close
April 2, squashing speculation that the show had Broadway in its
future.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're thrilled with the production, but it doesn't make sense
to transfer to Broadway in the current environment,'' producers
Jeffrey Seller and Kevin McCollum, said Tuesday in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The musical, which has book, music and lyrics by Andrew Lippa,
received largely mixed to unfavorable notices when it opened
Thursday at the nonprofit Manhattan Theater Club.
</P>
<P>
   A second ''Wild Party,'' also based on the Joseph Moncure March
poem, opens April 13 on Broadway. Directed by George C. Wolfe and
with a score by Michael John Chiusa, it has a starry cast including
Mandy Patinkin, Eartha Kitt and Oscar nominee Toni Collette.

<HEADLINE> AP Reviews 'Allergist's View'  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL KUCHWARA, AP Drama Critic
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Let's not beat around the Busch. That's Charles
Busch, author of ''The Tale of the Allergist's Wife,'' the funniest
new play to open on or off-Broadway this season.
</P>
<P>
   Busch, best-known as the author and star of the camp classic
''Vampire Lesbians of Sodom,'' makes a stretch for the mainstream
with ''Allergist's Wife,'' and his reach is just fine, thank you.
</P>
<P>
   This New York comedy, which opened Tuesday at the Manhattan
Theater Club's tiny Stage II, should speedily make its way to a
larger venue without much trouble.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days off-off-Broadway, Busch himself would have
played heroine Marjorie Taub, a troubled Upper West Side matron who
is feeling, in her own words, ''the loss of my soul.''
</P>
<P>
   But the playwright has found his perfect replacement in Linda
Lavin, giving the fiercest comic performance of her career. Lavin
takes no prisoners in her demented portrayal of a woman reveling in
her own unfulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   In the depths of her despair, Marjorie has become ''a retail
terrorist,'' trashing ceramic figurines in the Disney Store,
sending the likes of Goofy, Hercules and even the Little Mermaid to
their doom. Marjorie is mourning the loss of her psychiatrist, a
wonderful woman who, she says, you can't replace as easily as a
dead schnauzer.
</P>
<P>
   So Marjorie sits at home, nitpicking with her do-good husband, a
retired allergist played by the ever-reliable Tony Roberts, and
fighting with her mother, a potty-mouthed ''Golden Girl,'' who
keeps calling for Dr. Kevorkian.
</P>
<P>
   Momma, a rabid champion of Israel, is quite a revelation,
particularly as played by the wonderful Shirl Bernheim. She is a
one tough senior citizen who can match her daughter, neurosis for
neurosis.
</P>
<P>
   Into this gloom walks salvation: a long-lost childhood friend
from the Bronx named Lillian Greenblatt, now Lee Green. The woman
radiates a superhuman sunniness that is positively disarming -- and
alarming -- to Marjorie. Who else but Michele Lee, the perpetually
perky Karen MacKenzie of television's ''Knots Landing,'' could play
this glamorous sunbeam?
</P>
<P>
   The confident woman also oozes success while dropping famous
names as if they were confetti. She went to China with the Nixons --
''I didn't agree with them politically but I grew very fond of
Pat.'' Then worked for Chanel in Paris. Dated Gunter Grass. Shared
a can of soup with Andy Warhol. That sort of thing. Now she does
fund raising for a mysterious political organization.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, Marjorie and Lee are best buddies all over again.
But is this friendship too good to be true? Answers can be found in
the play's second act -- a series of revelations which don't quite
produce the comic momentum that pushes Act 1 to such dizzy heights.
</P>
<P>
   Director Lynne Meadow has done a fine job keeping the momentum
going, although she and her gang of actors can't disguise the fact
that the happy ending seems manufactured -- catering to the audience
rather than the characters Busch has created.
</P>
<P>
   Two other quibbles. The play is so topical that one wonders what
it will be like 10, 20 years from now. And its relentless Big Apple
references, from Merkin Hall to the Roundabout to the Lenox Hill
Thrift Shop, could leave non-New Yorkers scratching their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one has to admire the playwright's deft way with a joke.
There is a neurotic lunacy to them that is impossible to resist. At
Manhattan Theater Club, hilarity reigns supreme.
