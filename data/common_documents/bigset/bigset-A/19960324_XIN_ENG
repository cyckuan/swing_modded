<HEADLINE> Syrian President Meets with Yeltsin's Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
met here today a personal envoy of Russian President Boris Yeltsin
on bilateral relations and the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Boris Kozik, personal envoy of Yeltsin, handed a letter from
the Russian president to Assad during the meeting, according to
Syria's presidential spokesman Gobran Korieh. But he declined to
reveal the contents of the letter.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the two sides discussed means of
promoting bilateral relations and other issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources in the Syrian capital held that the Russian
envoy's visit took place at a time when a grave tension was
prevailing in south Lebanon, a result of Israeli threats to the
effect that Israel will react strongly to actions of Hezbollah, or
Party of God.
</P>
<P>
The Israelis, who held the Lebanese Government responsible of
laxity towards Hezbollah, have not ruled out the possibility of
shelling the positions of the Syrian troops in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that Damascus has been calling for the
re-convening of the Madrid peace conference for a review of the
causes that have led to the freezing of the Syrian-Israeli
negotiations in Maryland, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Syria's call has met with favorable response from Russia, and
President Yeltsin was in favor of resuming the Madrid peace
conference, despite his participation in a recent international
conference of peacemakers in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Italy Favors "United States of Europe:" Agnelli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Susanna
Agnelli said here today that Italy would strive to push forward a
federalist agenda during its six-month presidency of the European
Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Agnelli was quoted by the BBC television as expressing her
conviction that the forthcoming Inter-Governmental Conference to
be held in Turin, Friday, would lead to further European
integration.
</P>
<P>
"I think it would be a good idea for the whole of Europe and
everybody would be delighted if we became a United States of
Europe," she said.
</P>
<P>
She also urged British Prime Minister John Major to drop his
pledge to preserve Britain's veto power and agree to an extension
of qualified majority voting.
</P>
<P>
"It will need quite a lot of persuasion," she said, "but the
British government should understand that in some fields in which
without majority voting we're never going to make steps forward."
</P>
<P>
On the common foreign and security policy, she stressed that
the EU should build up the Western European Union as its defense
arm, alongside NATO, with the goal one day of establishing a
common army.
</P>
<P>
Several EU armies were already cooperating successfully in
former Yugoslavia, she said. "I think in time, as a matter of
fact, one should get to a common army."
</P>
<P>
The Italian minister also made it clear that she was certain a
single European currency would be launched in 1999 even if some
countries had difficulties in meeting the strict convergence
criteria.

AMMAN, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul
Karim Kabariti today told Yemeni Foreign Minister Abdul Karim
al-Ariyani that Jordan stood by Yemen's side in its dispute with
Eritrea over the Greater Hanish island in the Red Sea.

The Yemeni-Eritrean dispute flared last December into a brief
battle in which Eritrean forces took control of Greater Hanish
island and dozens of people from both side were killed.

<HEADLINE> UK Likely to Slaughter Cattle to End BSE Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The British government is likely
to slaughter all the cattle aged over 30 months to root out the
Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) or "mad cow" disease,
British Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a BBC television interview earlier today, Hogg gave
the firmest indication yet that the British government is prepared
to take drastic action upon the serious issue.
</P>
<P>
"A slaughter policy is not excluded and that is clearly a
matter which we need to consider," he said.
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that if a decision to slaughter was taken,
older cattle would be the focus because there had been very few
BSE cases in the cattle over 30 months.
</P>
<P>
"We certainly will consider any proposals that come to us from
sources which have clearly given the matter considerable
consideration," Hogg added.
</P>
<P>
Sir Richard Southwood, a leading expert on animal infection,
was reported to recommend the slaughter of more than 1 million
cows in a bid to curb the risk of transmitting BSE to humans.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the cost of slaughtering these cattle
would be as high as 20 billion pounds (about 31 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The British minister admitted that the crisis would result in
serious economic consequences for Britain. He would certainly
"look to our colleagues of the European Union (EU) to provide very
substantial assistance through the common agriculture policy, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The crisis was triggered Wednesday when the British government
acknowledged that there was a probable link between BSE and its
human equivalenteDDD, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD).
</P>
<P>
It was reported that about 10 EU countries and a growing number
of other countries have announced bans on British beef as a
precaution.

<HEADLINE> S.Leone Government "Disappointed" At Rebel Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The military government of
Sierra Leone today in a statement expressed "disappointment" at
the spates of attacks by the rebel the Revolutionary United Front
(RUF).
</P>
<P>
The statement, broadcast over the radio, quoted the public
relations office of the army as saying that about a week ago, the
RUF gave an assurance that it had put in place a two-month long
ceasefire, but it has now begun to violate the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The statement listed a number of attacks which it blamed on
the RUF, including an ambush of a civilian vehicle three days ago
in Mayokor of the Tonkolili district in the north.
</P>
<P>
"The vehicle was stripped bare," the statement said. It also
recalled another incident on March 21 when 21 people were wounded
in Shenge in the southern Moyamba district.
</P>
<P>
"On March 22, the rebels launched attacks at Tortobu,
Borborbu, Magobu, Sembobu and Bibi in the district in the south
and several civilians were wounded and dozens of others taken
away by the rebels."
</P>
<P>
The statement appealed to the RUF High Command to "respect
their earlier ceasefire agreement and to bring peace to the
country".
</P>
<P>
The statement did not mention Monday's meeting to be held
between the head of state, Brigadier General Julius Maada Bio,
and RUF leader Foday Sankoh in the Ivory Coast on a solution to
end the five-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
General Bio is now in Ghana after a short visit to Nigeria. He
is to proceed to Abidjan on Monday for the first ever meeting
between a Sierra Leonean leader and Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said today that Bio, who will hand over power to the
new civilian government on March 29, is paying farewell courtesy
calls to Abacha and Rawlings.
</P>
<P>
The two states, as well as Guinea, have provided sizable
forces to help the Sierra Leone army fight off the RUF rebels.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, government sources said the new Sierra Leone
parliament is to meet on April 2.

HONG KONG, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam and China won the men's
and women's team titles at the Second Asian Cities Gold Cup
Taekwondo Invitational Tournament which closed here today.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese won two gold, one silver and two bronze medals
from the men's events while the Chinese masters took four gold,
two silver and one bronze medals from the women's categories.
</P>
<P>
World taekwondo powerhouse South Korea, represented here by a
high school women's side, withdrew from the event this afternoon.
The Koreans protested decisions made by the Hong Kong judge which
led to a 5-3 victory by Chinese Tian Haifang over her South Korean
opponent.
</P>
<P>
The 13-member Chinese team was the second most medaled out of
the 11 teams from six countries and regions at the two-day meet,
with Hong Kong entering two teams for the men's events.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese won a total of six gold, three silver and three
bronze medals from the individual events and the gold medal from
the women's team competitions. Almost no one in the team would go
back to Beijing empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
Hosts Hong Kong should also be happy with a grab of three
golds, five silvers and seven bronze out of the six men's events
and as many women's weight categories.
</P>
<P>
"Our aim here it to learn from others," said Chinese coach
Zhang Haibin. "I know that some of Asia's ace competitors are not
present this time. We must keep cool and do still better in our
preparations for the Asian championships slated for June next year
in Australia," he said.

This will be the first Chinese appearance at Asian

Although HKTA would report the dispute to the WTF, preparations

Protests and disputes are something normal for the sport, he

<HEADLINE> Israel to Continue Closure on Gaza, West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres said here today that the four-week long closure on the West
Bank and Gaza Strip will continue because of the intelligence
warnings of planned terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
At a weekly cabinet meeting, Peres said there have been many
intelligence warnings about planned terrorist attacks against
Israeli targets by Hamas and the Islamic Jihad.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "only when these (warnings) are reduced and
the heads of terrorist groups are caught, will it be able to
consider significant easing of the closure."
</P>
<P>
Israel has imposed a total closure on the Gaza Strip and West
Bank following a series of suicide bombing attacks in Israel
since February 25, which left more than 60 dead and over 150
wounded.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Peres announced that despite the closure,
Palestinians who need medical treatments would be allowed to enter
Israel, but, he added, Israeli soldiers at all crossing points
have been given instructions to check all ambulances coming into
Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said that soldiers recently discovered explosives under a
pregnant Palestinian woman who was on her way to hospital in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
During last week, Israel had eased aspects of the closure, not
only allowing foodstuffs into the Gaza Strip and Palestinians to
move freely inside the West Bank, but also permitting Palestinian
goods to proceed from Gaza to the Ashdod port for export.
</P>
<P>
In addition to that, the Israeli army has allowed Palestinian
workers with work permits to return to their jobs in Jewish
settlements in the West Bank and part of the Jordan Valley.
</P>
<P>
However, thousands of Palestinian workers, who have not been
able to go to their jobs in Israel due to the closure, are still
barred from entering into the boundaries of Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority estimated that losses from
the closure are at 2 to 3 million U.S. dollars a day from
salaries alone, and about the same in loss of trade.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM Meets with Palestinian Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa met here today with Saeb Erekat, member of the Palestinian
Legislative Council, to discuss with him the current situation in
the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
Erekat, also a member of the Palestinian Authority, said after
the meeting that he came to Egypt under the instruction of
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to coordinate stances between
Egypt and the Palestinians over decisions of the Summit of
Peacemakers held in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh on
March 13.
</P>
<P>
The participating countries in the summit decided to join
efforts to fight terrorism to push forward the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Erekat condemned the Israeli punitive measures against the
Palestinians after the four suicide bombings in Israel since
February 25 killed 62 people, including the four bombers. The
Islamic Resistance movement (Hamas) has been blamed for the
attacks.
</P>
<P>
He said the Israeli practices including the closure of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip violate Israeli-Palestinian agreements.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Egypt called on Israel to halt the "oppressive
practices" against the Palestinians as these measures are hurting
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry spokesman said the measures contradict
international laws and conventions and strain relations between
Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli closure of the Palestinian self-rule areas has
barred Palestinians from jobs in Israel and reportedly led to food
shortages.

<HEADLINE> Russian Troops Ready for Possible Fighting in Grozny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Moscow stationed six antiaircraft
systems this morning near some important buildings in Grozny, the
capital of Chechnya, in preparation for a possible fresh attack by
the Chechen rebels, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The reports cited information from the military sources as
saying that Chechen rebels may mount an assault tonight.
</P>
<P>
The systems are installed around the Government House, the
Chechen Security Service and the Interior Ministry, which are also
guarded with tanks hidden behind house ruins and armored
personnel carriers.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this morning, Russian troops and Chechen police
resumed in Grozny a mopping-up operation in search for an
estimated 200 to 300 Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
The operation is especially active in the north-western
Zavodskoy and northern Staropromyslovsky districts of the city,
where the rebels are reportedly hidden.
</P>
<P>
A car with Chechen police was fired at from a grenade launcher
in the Staropromyslovsky district this morning. Nobody was killed,
but some people were shell-shocked, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,000 Chechen rebels broke into Grozny at the beginning of
this month and were later driven out of the capital city. The
fighting, which lasted for several days, resulted in hundreds of
deaths on both sides.
</P>
<P>
Russian troops are speeding up their "special" military
operations in the breakaway republic's southern, western,
south-western and eastern regions to wipe out the Chechen rebels,
whose stronghold and headquarters are reportedly located in the
south-western mountainous region.

<HEADLINE> Over Million Foreign Tourists Visit Zimbabwe Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe received more than 1
million foreign tourists, realizing 1.11 billion US Dollars in
earnings last year, Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge said at the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
Addressing Zimbabwean heads of missions and ambassadors in the
country for consultations, Mudenge said Zimbabwe should aim to
earn at least 1.1 billion US Dollars a year from tourism by the
turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Zimbabwe is not a small country but a giant
in terms of what it has to offer as a tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the Victoria Falls, one of the world's seven
greatest wonders, and other attractions such as Great Zimbabwe#,
there is need to do more to advertize them and a host of other
smaller destinations in order to increase earnings from the
tourism industry, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
He asked Zimbabwean diplomats, apart from their usual
business, to promote the country's two premier exports, tourism
and investment.

<HEADLINE> Fresh Milk Price Up In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Dairibord Zimbabwe Ltd today said
the price of fresh milk sold by its roundsmen goes up by 10
percent with effect from March 25.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned company said in a statement that milk sold by
roundsmen goes up from 2.15 Zimbabwe Dollars (0.24 US Dollar) a
liter to 2.37 Zimbabwe Dollars (0.26 US Dollar) a liter.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the company had been forced to readjust
prices, which were last increased in the middle of last year due
rising costs.
</P>
<P>
Among the rising costs were high producer prices being paid to
encourage farmers to deliver more milk to the company's
processing plants.
</P>
<P>
The statement said although the company had promised to
protect consumers, it could no longer absorb the rising costs,
hence the decision to increase the price of milk.
</P>
<P>
"The higher consumer prices of fresh milk over the past year
are still well below the increases in prices of other basic
commodities," the statement said.

<P>
HARARE, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Over 19,000 Zimbabwean students,
who passed ordinary level examinations last year and were
qualified for advanced level education, have failed to secure
places due to an acute shortage of A-level schools throughout
the southern African nation.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Education Ministry secretary Stan Chegwedere said
that more than 28,000 students were qualified for advanced level,
but only 9,000 or 32 percent of them were accommodated at the few

The Ministry of Education is concerned about the acute
shortage of advanced level schools throughout the country, he

</P>
<P>
The ministry has for the past 16 years failed to construct

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwaiti National
Assembly's Legislative and Legal Committee has recently approved a
draft bill allowing the public prosecution to supervise jails and
deportation detentions.
</P>
<P>
The draft bill tabled by members of parliament aims at ensuring
the proper implementation of laws and supervising any illegal lock
up of any citizen or resident as stipulated by the constitution,
the committee said in a report, according to Kuwait News Agency

</P>
<P>
"The public prosecution has the right to release those
illegally apprehended and the right to release any expatriate
withheld for later deportation whether with or without bail
according to the circumstances," it said.
</P>
<P>
According to the committee, the proposal aims at securing
the required humanitarian health and social care services to
the prisoners and deportees and looking into complaints on the
contrary.
</P>
<P>
The currently applicable prisons law entrusts the directors of
prison with the right to supervise prisons and detentions.

International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF) have changed the
Olympic Games timetable for him on Sunday.
</P>

The IAAF also changed the time of the men's long jump so former

as well, even before Lewis has to qualify for the US team for this
year's Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The time of the men's marathon has also been switched to 7:00
am instead of 1830 as previously announced. For some experts
feared an evening start would be a risk to some unexperienced
runners.

The IAAF decided to go for the early morning start as the less

<HEADLINE> Indian Trade Bodies Undecided on Funding of Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The burning issue of corporate
funding of elections has caught India's apex trade bodies in a
tight bend as they are unable to forge a common approach due to
serious differences over the modalities of contributions, the
Press Trust of India (PTI) said today.
</P>
<P>
While the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) favors
government funding of elections, the Federation of Indian Chambers
of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) finds nothing wrong with
corporate bodies funding the polls including donations to
political parties.
</P>
<P>
But the Associated Charmers of Commerce and Industry of India
(Assocham) says it would much rather leave this issue to the
individual members to decide.
</P>
<P>
Many industrialists told PTI that they did not want to be
identified with any political party, particularly if the
contributions had to be made by way of cheques.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources said that while corporates had no problem
making cheque payments on which the company's boards had to
decide, most companies would prefer making contributions by cash
to political parties they supported for meeting election
expenditure.
</P>
<P>
In wake of the hawala case, an 18-million-US-dollar bribery
scandal, Indian political parties are seeking donations from
companies publicly in the coming general elections scheduled to be
held from April 27 to May 21.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Denounces Israeli Measures against Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Egypt today denounced what it
called the "oppressive Israeli practices" against the Palestinian
people, saying that Egypt is following these punitive measures
"with deep concern."
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry spokesman said the Israeli practices
contradict international laws and conventions and strain relations
between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israel imposed restrictions on Palestinians, including the
closure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, after four suicide
bombings carried out by Palestinian Islamic extremists killed 58
people.
</P>
<P>
The restrictions have barred Palestinians from their jobs and
led to food shortages in the Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Egypt rejects the measures and calls on
Israel to halt them because they are hurting the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa called
for an end to the closure of the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been a chief mediator between Israel and the
Palestinians in their peace negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Contradictory News on Malaria-HIV Link Emerges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Researchers probing into a
possible link between malaria and the human immune deficiency
virus (HIV) are presenting contradictory results, the Press Trust
of India said today.
</P>
<P>
Scientist Altaf Lal from the Center for Disease Control (CDC)
of the United States said at a global meeting on parasitic
diseases here that antigens present on the malaria parasite
plasmodium falciparum may enhance HIV replication.
</P>
<P>
They may also hasten the progression from HIV infection to
full-blown acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), Lal said.
</P>
<P>
He said studies in cultured cell lines at the CDC lab over the
last six to eight months suggest strongly that a pigment present
in the malarial antigens may be responsible for the increased HIV
multiplication.
</P>
<P>
Both the malarial antigens and pigment caused a 10-to-100- fold
increase in a core protein of the HIV.
</P>
<P>
Since the pigment remains in circulation for a long time after
a person is cured of malaria, it may have "grave implications" in
all malaria prone regions of the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
The findings contradict a French report presented three months
ago at an international conference on immunology here which said
that malaria infection appeared to protect mice against AIDS and
in some cases, even reverse its manifestations.

<HEADLINE> Proposal Adopted on Explaining Implementation of Nationality Law in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The second Plenum of the
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR), which closed today, adopted a proposal on making
explanations for implementing the Nationality Law of the People's
Republic of China (PRC) in Hong Kong from July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The proposal will be submitted to the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC) for examination and approval.
</P>
<P>
It explains that all HK residents of Chinese descent are
Chinese citizens, provided that they were in China, including Hong
Kong, or comply with the regulations of the Nationality Law.
</P>
<P>
All Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong, whether they possess
British Dependent Territories Citizen Passports, or British
National (Overseas) Passports or not, are Chinese citizens.
</P>
<P>
From July 1, 1997, the above-mentioned Chinese citizens may
continue to use their valid travel certificates, issued by the
British government, when travelling in other countries and
regions. However, with the possession of these certificates, they
are not entitled to enjoy British consular protection rights when
travelling in the Hong Kong SAR, and the other areas of China.
</P>
<P>
The British citizenship of any Chinese citizens in Hong Kong is
not acknowledged by the Nationality Law, if the citizenship has
been obtained under the British Nationality Selection Scheme.
</P>
<P>
These people are regarded as Chinese citizens, but have no
access to British consular protection rights in the Hong Kong SAR,
and China's other areas.
</P>
<P>
Chinese citizens in the Hong Kong SAR, who have a residence
right in foreign countries, may use certificates issued by foreign
governments for travelling to other countries and regions, but
cannot enjoy consular protection rights by possessing such
certificates.
</P>
<P>
Chinese citizens in the Hong Kong SAR may apply to SAR
departments in charge of nationality application when they intend
to change their nationality.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong SAR government should be authorized to designate
the Immigration Department to take charge of nationality
applications, in accordance with the Nationality Law and the above
regulations.

<HEADLINE> Furthering Relations across Taiwan Straits Constitutes Greatest Popular Feeling (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many Taiwan residents have written and contacted newspapers
demanding the maintaining of stability in Taiwan, and the
improvement of cross-straits relations.
</P>
<P>
During the election, Lee Teng-hui had to declare time and again
that he will seek China's reunification, that he will not pursue
"Taiwan independence", and that after winning the election he will
try to improve cross-straits relations.
</P>
<P>
What does the election result signify to Lee Teng-hui? the
article asked.
</P>
<P>
The publisher of Taiwan's Business Weekly expressed the view
that Lee's votes were mostly from rural voters, who hold that
maintaining the status quo means maintaining stability.
</P>
<P>
He said that Taiwan's urban residents and intellectuals do not
think that way. They maintain that the first thing the
newly-elected Taiwan leaders must do is to further cross-straits
relations.
</P>
<P>
According to the senior reporter of the "China Times", the
matter of paramount importance for Lee Teng-hui, after the
election, is to seize the opportunity for developing
cross-straits relations, and cease to be self-willed or make
self-contradictory remarks.
</P>
<P>
A professor of Danjiang University in Taiwan said that after
the election Lee must handle cross-straits relations properly,
replace confrontation with negotiations, and readjust the policy
concerning the mainland. For instance, holding negotiations with
the mainland on ending the state of hostility across the straits.
</P>
<P>
Public opinions in Taiwan agree that under the current
situation, the state of cross-straits relations has a direct
impact on Taiwan's economy.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan scholars hold that the sustained tension in, or the
deterioration of, the cross-straits relations will inevitably
result in a mid-term and long-term recession of the Taiwan economy.
</P>
<P>
The publisher of the Business Weekly expressed the hope that
Lee Teng-hui will mean what he says, and that he should no longer
play the trick of a double-dealer.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Xinhua News Agency today
published a roundup entitled "Furthering Relations across the
Taiwan Straits Constitutes the Greatest Popular Feeling -- How
Public Opinions in Taiwan View the Election."
</P>
<P>
The article said that the result of the election in Taiwan was
announced yesterday. Lee Teng-hui and Lien Chan, candidates of the
Kuomintang, won the election with 54 percent of votes.
</P>
<P>
Peng Ming-min, and his running mate of the Democratic
Progressive Party, who strongly preach "Taiwan independence"
failed in the election, gaining 21.2 percent of votes, a figure
far lower than they anticipated.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, public opinions in Taiwan also noticed that Hao
Pei-tsun, and three other candidates who oppose "Taiwan
independence", and back the development of relations across the
Taiwan Straits, won a total of 24.8 percent of votes. The four
candidates are described as the third force by Taiwan media
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The article said that almost all Taiwan people now focus their
attention on whether the winners of the election will try to
further cross-straits relations, in line with Taiwan's popular
feeling.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan residents share the view that the only way out for
Taiwan is to develop relations across the Taiwan Straits," the
article said.
</P>
<P>
The publisher of Taiwan's Business Weekly expressed the view
that the strength of the third force is not to be neglected.
</P>
<P>
He noted that a substantial drop in the votes for the
Democratic Progressive Party candidates demonstrated that the
"Taiwan independence" proposition was dealt a heavy blow.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior reporter with the newspaper, "China
Times," the fact that the all-time low vote this time for the
Democratic Progressive Party candidates, indicates that it is
unimaginable to win elections in Taiwan, where the middle class is
influential, using the ploy of "Taiwan independence".
</P>
<P>
During the election, one of the three TV debates held in Taiwan
was devoted to a discussion about the one-China principle. Except
for the candidates of the Democratic Progressive Party, who
insisted on their "Taiwan independence" stand, all other
candidates held that the one-China principle should never be
abandoned.

<P>
The article pointed out that the struggle carried out in the

had dealt a telling blow at those advocating "Taiwan independence"

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Estonian Foreign Minister Siim
Kallas today left Tallinn, capital of Estonia, for Washington on a
five-day visit to discuss security issue with the White House on
behalf of the Baltic states, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Kallas is scheduled to meet his U.S. counterpart Warren
Christopher, and high-ranking officials of the U.S. Defense
Ministry and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) during his stay
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Estonia has been seeking to join NATO together with the other
two Baltic states -- Lithuania and Latvia.
</P>
<P>
Under NATO's eastward expansion plans, the three Baltic states,
which were all former Soviet republics, and all the other
countries in central and eastern Europe should be included in the
West military alliance.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the foreign ministers of 12 central and eastern
European countries in Prague, capital of the Czech Republic, last
Wednesday, Christopher said that the strategy of NATO's eastward
enlargement remained unchanged. Christopher reiterated the stand
in his talks with Russian leaders in Moscow at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
During the bilateral talks, the Russian leaders, including
President Boris Yeltsin and Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov
voiced firm opposition to NATO's eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
While making efforts to join NATO, the Baltic states hope
to maintain normal relations with Russia, diplomats here said.
</P>
<P>
The three Baltic countries, which got independent after the
1991 demise of the Soviet Union, have been staying away from the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), which grouped 12 former
Soviet republics.

<P>
KATHMANDU, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Five Nepali ministers, who
handed over their resignations to Prime Minister Sher Bahadur
Deuba Friday, have withdrawn their resignations, according to a
statement issued here earlier today.
</P>
<P>
Local Development Minister Kamal Thapa said in the statement
that he and other four ministers from the second ruling National
Democratic Party (RPP) withdrew their resignations with a view to
averting a split of the party.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of RPP had been divided into two groups with different
views over a no-confidence against the Nepali Congress (NC)-led
coalition government tabled by the main opposition Communist Party
of Nepal (UML) in the Lower House.
</P>
<P>
A special house session rejected the no-confidence motion late
today by a vote of 106 against 90.
</P>
<P>
The RPP party, with its 19 MPs in the house, held the key to
the survival of the government as NC and UML have 86 and 88 MPs
respectively in the 205-seat house.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Nepali Government Survives Challenge of Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali coalition government
today survived a no-confidence motion tabled by the main
opposition party after rounds of games were maneuvered between
different political camps here in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Although the National Democratic Party (RPP), the second ruling
partner in the three-party government led by the Nepali Congress
(NC) party, were divided on whether it would withdraw from the
ruling coalition and support the no-confidence motion, almost all
of its MPs voted against the opposition motion today in a special
session of the Lower House.
</P>
<P>
The no-confidence motion tabled by the Communist Party of Nepal
(UML) against Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba was defeated in
the house by 106 votes to 90 with the rest MPs abstaining from the
voting.
</P>
<P>
The UML party two weeks ago called for the special house
session and registered a no-confidence motion against the prime
minister, stating that the parliament had lost confidence in his
government as it failed to solve the nation's pressing problems
including corruption, inflation and administrative irregularity.
</P>
<P>
RPP, with its 19 seats in the House of Representatives,
obviously held the key to the survival of the coalition government
as the main ruling NC party and main opposition UML have 86 and 88
seats respectively in the 205-seat house.
</P>
<P>
The UML motion came out soon after a RPP Central Committee
meeting concluded that RPP was neglected by the main ruling party
in the government and it should review the understanding reached
between ruling partners when the government was formed last
September.
</P>
<P>
UML had offered RPP to form an alternative coalition government
with its parliamentary leader Lokendra Bahadur Chand as prime
minister if the no-confidence motion was passed, resulting in
differences within RPP over the party's stance on the motion.
</P>
<P>
The rift within RPP, believed to be consisted of two factions
loyal to Chand and to party president Surya Bahadur Thapa
respectively, was intensified when Thapa announced not to support
the no-confidence motion before the House special session opened
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, RPP MPs of the Chand faction voted against the
no-confidence motion today after the party Saturday issued a whip
ordering them to do so.
</P>
<P>
It was noticed that Chand, RPP's parliament leader, himself
abstained from today's voting in the house over the UML motion.
</P>
<P>
Local observers said that as the main opposition UML party
failed to lobby supports from other oppositions to secure the
enough votes for the motion, those RPP MPs loyal to Chand changed
their minds at the last minute opting to stand by the ruling side.
</P>
<P>
Since 13 of RPP's all 19 MPs are included in the cabinet of the
present coalition government, some of them even holding important
posts like foreign minister and water resources minister, it was
rather difficult for the opposition to persuade RPP to withdraw
from the ruling coalition, they said.
</P>
<P>
The present coalition government was formed last September by
NC, RPP and the Nepal Goodwill Party after they jointly ousted the
minority UML government by passing a NC-proposed no-confidence
motion in a similar special House session.

HONG KONG, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Cigarette smuggling cases in
Hong Kong jumped by about 30 percent between 1992 and last year,
when more than 300 million cigarettes were seized, according to a
report in today's Hong Kong Standard.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's Customs and Excise Department, which is responsible
 for tracking down smugglers, was quoted as saying that the
illegal trade in tobacco is likely to increase this year.
</P>
<P>
The estimated amount of lost duty nearly doubled between 1994
and 1995, rising to more than 200 million HK dollars.
</P>
<P>
Anti-smuggling officers say criminals are drawn to cigarette
smuggling because of the high rate of duty paid on tobacco in Hong
 Kong compared with the territory's neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong established an anti-cigarette smuggling task force of
 40 officers in May 1994.

<P>
He emphasized that China has always had full confidence in Hong
Kong's future, because China's stable political situation, and

transition, and long-term prosperity, and stability in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
China also has a set of correct guiding policies which have
been written into the Sino-British Joint Declaration, and the Basic
Law, referring to the "one country, two systems" principle, and
other concrete policies concerning Hong Kong affairs, Qian said.

China believes that the Hong Kong people are able to govern
Hong Kong well after the colonial rule ends in Hong Kong, said
Qian, citing other reasons for Hong Kong's promising future.

</P>
<P>
As China will resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong

</P>
<P>

</P>

</P>
<P>
-- two days' holiday for National Day;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
-- two days' holidays for Christmas.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Mossad Has New Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Maj.-Gen. Danny Yatom has
become new chief of Mossad, Israel's secret agency responsible
for foreign intelligence.
</P>
<P>
Yatom's appointment was approved at a cabinet meeting this
morning.
</P>
<P>
The new Mossad chief has served as military aide to Prime
Minister Shimon Peres and late prime minister Yitzhak Rabin. He
also has served two stints as head of Central Command of the
Israeli Defense Forces.
</P>
<P>
Yatom is reportedly known not just for his discretion, but
also for his bureaucratic skills. Under Rabin, he gradually
centralized all peace process issues -- not only the
security-related ones -- in the Prime minister's Office.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in the history of Israel that the name
of Mossad chief was published. Under Israel's law, names of the
leaders of all secret agencies, including Mossad, General Security
Service (GSS), are banned from publication.
</P>
<P>
But with the end of the Cold War and development of peace
process in the Middle East, Israel's mass media frequently
disclosed the names in spite of the ban. As such the government
has also eased the order.
</P>
<P>
Yatom's predecessor, whose name is still kept secret, will
retire and is expected to be appointed director of the Maccabi
Health Fund.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Two people were killed and a
number of houses collapsed in Riyadh, capital of Saudi Arabia late
Saturday night due to the torrential rains sweeping through
various parts of the kingdom since Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Major Muhammad Al-Harbi, official from the Civil Defense
Department in Riyadh, said the victims were a woman and a child,
according to Kuwait News Agency today.
</P>
<P>
Schools and universities were closed in Riyadh and roads were
blocked as trees were rooted up by the thunderstorm. Many people
were trapped, and telephone links and electricity were cut off in
various areas, al Harbi said.
</P>
<P>
Helicopters evacuated around 200 campers who were trapped by
the heavy rains in the desert. The campers were spending their
weekend there, the Civil Defense Department said.
</P>
<P>
Main roads outside Riyadh witnessed the death of four people
and the injury of five in the northern city of Al-Majmaa.
</P>
<P>
The Civil Defense Department adviced desert lovers to stay
close to the main roads in order to avoid being swept away by the
heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
Saudi authorities have repeatedly warned desert revelers
against pitching tents in valleys and low land under mountains to
avoid hazards of sudden outpour of rain.

<TEXT>
<P>
The communique continued that if the first legislative council
of the Hong Kong SAR is not able to come into existence at the
time when the SAR is founded, the establishment of a provisional
legislative council in the Hong Kong SAR will be a necessary
measure, to ensure Hong Kong's smooth transition and the effective
operation after the founding of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
The authority of the provisional legislative council, to be set
up by the preparatory committee, has been covered by the
authorization of the preparatory committee about "being
responsible for matters concerned to prepare for the establishment
of the Hong Kong SAR", in the second article of the "Decision of
the National People's Congress on the Method for the Formation of
the First Government and the First Legislative Council of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the preparatory committee's decision on establishing
a provisional legislative council is fully backed by law.
</P>
<P>
The session said that the nationality of Hong Kong residents is
a complex issue concerned by the Hong Kong society, and directly
related to the direct interests of Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
To resolve the issue, it is necessary to follow the Nationality
Law of the People's Republic of China, and the Basic Law of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, as well as the consistent
policies of the Chinese government, on the issue of the
nationality of Hong Kong residents. It is also necessary to take
into account Hong Kong's history and reality, and make
corresponding arrangement for putting into effect the Nationality
Law of the People's Republic of China in the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, the session proposed that the Standing
Committee of the National People Congress makes an explanation on
the implementation of the Chinese nationality law in the Hong Kong
SAR.
</P>
<P>
The session has confirmed the transitional arrangements for
Hong Kong's public holidays, and the establishment of a committee
in charge of activities to mark Hong Kong's return to the
motherland by various sectors in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
According to the session, the third plenary session of the
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong SAR will be held from May
24 to 25.

<HEADLINE> Qian On Democracy, Confidence in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Inviting Hong Kong people from
all walks of life to have a say in the region's future never
happened under the rule of British Hong Kong government, China's
Vice-Premier Qian Qichen said in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
He also said that mechanically copying political systems in
western countries does not accord with the reality in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Qian added that a copied system "does not take
into account interests of all social groups, and thus will hamper
prosperity and stability in Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
Developing a democratic political system in Hong Kong must be
in line with Hong Kong's reality, in order to safeguard the smooth
transition, and the long-term prosperity and stability in Hong
Kong, said Qian Qichen.
</P>
<P>
Setting up the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR),
letting Hong Kong People govern Hong Kong and exercising
high-degree autonomy, is both the prerequisite and goals for the
realization of democracy in Hong Kong, said Qian, also chairman of
the SAR Preparatory Committee.
</P>
<P>
"In drawing up the Basic Law and establishing SAR, we have
invited Hong Kong people from all walks of life to take full part
in the work, and have conducted wide consultations," said Qian at
the closing meeting of the Second Plenary Session of the
Preparatory Committee of SAR in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
"Things like that never occurred under the rule of the British
Hong Kong government."
</P>
<P>
He said, "Only after the colonial rule ends, Hong Kong returns
to the motherland, SAR is set up according to the principle
of 'One Country, Two Systems', and 'Hong Kong People governing
Hong Kong' is practised, high-degree autonomy is exercised, and
Hong Kong people become the masters of their own affairs will Hong
Kong have real democracy," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that China has always had full confidence in Hong
Kong's future, because China's stable political situation and
booming economy is the fundamental guarantee for the smooth
transition, and long-term prosperity and stability in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"The Outline of the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) for
National Economic and Social Development, and the Long-range
Objectives to the Year 2010, will surely further promote
development and prosperity in Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
China also has a set of correct guiding policies which have
been written into the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic
Law, referring to the "One Country, Two Systems" principle, and
other concrete policies concerning Hong Kong affairs, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
China believes that the Hong Kong people are able to govern
Hong Kong well, said Qian, citing other reasons for Hong Kong's
promising future.

<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- A caretaker legislative council
will be set up in Hong Kong if the proposed First Legislative
Council is unable to come into existence when the territory is
handed over to China by the British.
</P>
<P>
This was announced in an official communique, issued in Beijing
today, at the end of the Second Plenary Session of the Preparatory
Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
The committee, in its Press Communique, accused Britain of
sabotaging the Sino-British Agreement on Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Other issues discussed included the nationality of Hong Kong
residents, public holidays, and the start of preparations to mark
Hong Kong's return to China.
</P>
<P>
The session, from March 23 to 24, was presided over by Wang
Hanbin, vice-chairman of the Hong Kong SAR Preparatory Committee.
</P>
<P>
Qian Qichen, vice-premier of the State Council and chairman of
the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong SAR, made a speech at
the session.
</P>
<P>
The session approved the Decision of the Preparatory Committee
of the Hong Kong SAR under the National People's Congress "on the
Establishment of a Provisional Legislative Council of the Hong
Kong SAR", the Decision of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong
Kong SAR under the National People's Congress on the "Arrangement
of Public Holidays in Hong Kong from the Second Half of 1997 to
the End of 1998", the Decision of the Preparatory Committee of the
Hong Kong SAR under the National People's Congress on the
"Establishment of a Committee in Charge of Activities to Mark Hong
Kong's Return to the Motherland by Various Sectors in Hong Kong",
and the Decision of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong SAR
under the National People's Congress on the "Explanatory Proposal
about the Implementation of the 'Nationality Law of the People's
Republic of China' in the Hong Kong SAR."
</P>
<P>
The session noted that the transitional arrangements for the
members of Hong Kong's last legislative council to be affirmed as
members of the first legislative council of the Hong Kong SAR,
cannot be realized due to the sabotage of the Sino-British
agreement by the British side. The Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress made a decision on August 31, 1994, to
end the last legislative council of the British Hong Kong
government on June 30, 1997.

ANKARA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz today urged Greece to hold negotiations without any
preconditions to settle all the Aegean issues between the two
feuding NATO members.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Yilmaz said, "I am proposing to Greece to
engage in a comprehensive process of peaceful settlement that
will not exclude from beginning any method of settlement
including third party arbitration."
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that Greece will give due consideration to
Turkey's call for a peaceful settlement based on international
law and legitimacy and will not let this historic opportunity
slip away.
</P>
<P>
"The latest crisis has demonstrated once again that the
present state of Turco-Greek relations is fraught with
dangers. The fundamental interests of both countries lie in peace
and cooperation, not confrontation. We both stand to benefit from
developing friendly and good-neighborly relations," said Yilmaz.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister pointed out that Turkey is ready and
determined to do its utmost in that regard, saying that the Greek
leaders also have the necessary political will to live up to this
historic responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece staged a military confrontation over the
disputed Imia Islets on the Aegean Sea in January. The United
States interfered and prevented a possible conflict between the
two NATO allies at the last minute.

BAGHDAD, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Under more than five-year harsh
U.N. trade sanctions, Iraqis today cast their ballots in the
polling stations to elect the members of the National Assembly
(parliament), whose term ended last December. This is the first
parliamentary elections since the end of the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
A total of 8 million voters who are eligible for participating
in the election started voting in 15 provinces except for three
Kurds-held autonomous regions in the north of the country. The
three regions have been out of the administrative control of the
Iraqi central government after the end of the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Among the 250 seats in the parliament, 220 members will be
chosen from 689 candidates today by the voters and the voting of
the remaining 30 seats for the Kurdish areas will be postponed
according to the election law issued by Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Local sources said that the results of the election for the
fourth session of the parliament since 1980 will be announced
later today or early Monday.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi newspaper said that the election is a significant
phase in the life of the Iraqi people and a big step on the path
of democratic building in Iraq.

The annual "Walk Against Want" is expected to raise 1.2 million
Australian Dollars (about 0.9 million US dollars), said Jeremy
Hobbs, executive director of the Community Aid Abroad (CAA) in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
"BY voting with their feet today, Australians have made it
clear that they don't share the government's mean-spirited stance
on development aid," he said, adding that "they have demonstrated
that, far from just wanting to be 'relaxed and comfortable'
themselves, they care deeply about the basic needs of the world's
poorest people."
</P>
<P>
Overseas aid groups in Australia have long been disappointed
with the Labor Party's failure to meet the United Nations'
recommended aid target for wealthy nations and they also expressed
concern during the federal election campaign about the coalition's
plan to cut overseas aid.
</P>
<P>
About 7,000 people turned out in Sydney for the walk, while
thousands more participated in other towns and cities across the
country, according to Australian Associated Press reports.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Lower Interest Payments in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
lower its allocations for interest payments in 1997 to just 76.8
billion pesos (3.072 billion US dollars) from the 78.9 billion
pesos (3.156 billion dollars) appropriated in 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to the Development Budget Coordinating Committee,
this is due to the reduction of interest rates as well as the
shift of the government's borrowings from short-term to
medium-term maturities.
</P>
<P>
The projected lower interest payments for 1997 will be
equivalent to 16.5 percent of gross national product (GNP), 3
percent less than the 19.5 percent of GNP for 1996's payments.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Treasury is even batting for a lower interest
payment allocations of 74.9 billion pesos (2.996 billion dollars)
for next year.
</P>
<P>
Its optimism is based on its success in offering longer-term
government instruments.
</P>
<P>
Aside from the weekly, short-term government securities, the
Bureau of Treasury has successfully been able to offer longer-term
fixed and floating-rate treasury bills.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Defector Arrives in Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul
Karim Kabariti confirmed here Saturday that the defected former
Iraqi Chief of Staff Lieutenant-General Nizar Kazraji had arrived
here late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Today's Arabic daily AD-Dustour reported that the prime
minister said in an interview with the U.S. National Broadcasting
Company here Saturday that his government had agreed to give the
Iraqi defector "the permission to stay in the Kingdom for one
month," but not "political asylum."
</P>
<P>
Kabariti said it was up to the former Iraqi Chief of Staff
himself to decide whether he will stay in Amman or go to another
country, adding that the government will not make any decision
until Kazraji asked it to do so.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources here said that Kazraji had fled Iraq
through the northern Kurdish region which is beyond the control
of the Baghdad government and "landed in Amman late Thursday
aboard a flight from Turkey."
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival in Amman, Kazraji was not met by senior Jordanian
officials as Hussein Kamel, son-in-law of Iraqi President Saddam,
was when he defected to the kingdom last August, but by members of
the Iraqi National Accord (INA) movement, an exile opposition
group which set up a regional office here earlier this year, and
was whisked away to a residential area of the capital, sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The defector led Iraq's Seventh Army Division during the
1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war and served as Chief of Staff during the
Iraqi occupation of Kuwait in 1991.
</P>
<P>
He is the second senior Iraqi military officer to defect in
one year. General Wafic Samarai, head of military intelligence,
defected last year and now lives in Syria.
</P>
<P>
A number of Iraqi officers of junior ranks have been reported
to have defected since the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The general's defection follows the debacle of Hussein Kamel
and his brother Saddam Kamel, both sons-in-law of Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein, who defected to Jordan last August. The two
brothers returned to Baghdad in February after the Iraqi
leadership granted them a pardon, but were killed by relatives two
days after their return.

<HEADLINE> HK Calls For Joint Efforts to Fight Tuberculosis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 24 (Xinhua) -- A senior Hong Kong official
today called on the local people to join efforts to combat
tuberculosis (TB).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony marking the World TB Day, Secretary for
Health and Welfare Mrs. Katherine Fok said that the notification
rate of TB in Hong Kong was still high and health education on TB
is very important.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Health Department show that last year a
total of 6,212 people were infected with TB, and 418 died of the
disease. In the past four years, over 6,000 people were infected
annually on average, with a death rate of 6.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Fok pointed out that the key to successful treatment of the
disease lay in ensuring that the patient complete the entire
course of anti-TB treatment.
</P>
<P>
She noted that Hong Kong has adopted the DOTS (directly
observed treatment, short course) treatment since the 1970s to
assess patients in the process of treatment and a continuous
downward trend of TB in Hong Kong had been achieved.
</P>
<P>
Fok reassured the public that with the commitment of the
government and various other sectors, Hong Kong would provide the
highest quality of care and services in the fight against the
disease.
</P>
<P>
WHO has proclaimed March 24 to be the World TB Day. On this
very day in 1882, the discovery of TB bacilli was officially
announced.
</P>
<P>
According to WHO figures, one third of the world population are
 now infected with TB bacillus.

<HEADLINE> Yemeni President Calls for Peaceful Settlement of Dispute with Eritrea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni President Ali Abdullah
Saleh has reaffirmed that the peaceful approach adopted by his
country in solving the dispute with Eritrea over the Red Sea
island of Greater Hanish proceeds from Yemen's sense of
responsibility toward the international community.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks in an interview broadcast
Saturday evening by the Middle East Broadcasting Corporation (MBC).
</P>
<P>
"We are quite confident we will restore our right (to the
Hanish Island) in virtue of the relevant evidence and documents
we have," the Yemeni President said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the mediation efforts made by relevant
regional and international communities are welcomed by Yemen. The
proposals put forward by France are acceptable to Yemen.
</P>
<P>
Saleh also expressed appreciation for the Egyptian and
Ethiopian mediation efforts.
</P>
<P>
"The greatest concession made by Yemen is that it has taken no
military action, and the concession which is being made by Yemen
now is that it is looking for a peaceful settlement," the Yemeni
President added.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his confidence that the French mediation, which is
supported by U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, would
not fail.
</P>
<P>
President Saleh urged both sides to resolve the Hanish Island
crisis by peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
The Red Sea island of Greater Hanish, which the Eritreans now
control, is one of the three islands claimed by both Yemen and
Eritrea. The other two are Lesser Hanish and Zuqar.
</P>
<P>
Eritrean troops landed on the disputed Greater Hanish Island,
80 kilometers from Yemen and Eritrea, on December 15, 1995, and
clashed with Yemeni troops. The fightings ended December 18 under
a truce.

<HEADLINE> HK Residential Construction Falls Short of Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Preliminary official figures
show that just 19,090 new flats could be completed in the private
sector in Hong Kong this year, falling far short of the forecast
26,160 units.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported today that the 19,090 figure is the lowest
 level in more than 10 years and is about 40 percent lower than
the historical 10-year average of around 30,000 units a year.
</P>
<P>
Last year a total of 22,620 residential units were completed,
some 29 percent lower than the 10-year average.
</P>
<P>
Reasons for delayed construction are attributed to plunging
prices and the difficulty in getting bank financing last year.
</P>
<P>
Official forecasts show that completions should improve
slightly in 1997, rising to 26,800, and completions in 1998 would
be at least similar to that of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Local property developers said that short-supply of new flats
will put an upward pressure on prices and rentals.

<P>
EDMONTON, Canada, March 24 (Xinhua) -- American Michelle Kwan
dethroned China's first figure skating world champion Chen Lu to
win the women's title at the world figure skating championships
here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 15-year-old Kwan anchored the United States to a clean
sweep of the singles titles. Todd Eldredge won the men's title on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kwan received two perfect 6.0s and seven 5.9s for presentation,
barely beating Chen, who also got two 6.0s, into second place.
</P>
<P>
Kwan, who led the short program on Friday, nailed seven triple
jumps including a triple toe loop at the end of her four-minute
free skate to score more than Chen in the technical marks.
</P>
<P>
Irina Slutskaya of Russia finished third.

Kwan had a nearly unbeatable season after winning five of her
six events, including her first national championship.

while the 19-year-old Chen got hers from the French and Hungarian.
</P>

decide who win, but there was no Chinese judge on the panel."
</P>
<P>
Chen's coach Li Mingzhu told Chinese Central Television Station
that Chen should be decided winner.
</P>
<P>
"I think Chen is the best today," she said. "I feel very sorry
for her."

KATHMANDU, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's three ruling parties
defeated a no-confidence motion against the coalition government

<HEADLINE> Child Abuse Cases Rise in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Child abuse cases in the
Philippines rose more than 200 percent in the past five years with
sexual abuse topping the list, according to the Department of
Social Welfare and Development (DSWD).
</P>
<P>
Some 2,016 child abuse cases were recorded in the country in
the past five years, 70 percent of which are rape cases.
</P>
<P>
The DSWD said that this volume is expected to double even if
the law has criminalized child abuse in many forms, and imposed
prison term and even death penalty on violators.
</P>
<P>
Forms of child abuse include rape, sexual exploitation,
maltreatment, labor exploitation and child trafficking.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Scientists Solve Sea Shell Secrets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli scientists said their
new findings in research on shellfish may help design improved
materials for aircraft and other devices.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to seek explanation on how clams, snails and other
mollusks control their shell-building process, Israeli scientists
have come to conclusion that their findings may one day lead to
new ideas for designing improved composite material, such as those
used in aircraft and spaceship parts, orthopedic prostheses and a
variety of other devices.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed in the latest issue of Science Tips
published by Weizmann Institute of Science based in Rehovot, a
city near Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
According to Weizmann Institute researchers, mollusk shells
are made of a natural composite material. They consist of a
supporting protein framework filled with calcium carbonate
crystals. These crystals come in two types, with one often
forming the rougher outer layer of the shell, and the other --
commonly knowns as mother-of-pearl -- the shiny inner one.
</P>
<P>
Their source material is the same, but minor structural
differences grant them different properties and
appearance. Growing the right kind of crystal in the right place
is crucial for the strength of the shell.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Lia Addadi, Prof. Stephen Weiner and Dr. Shira Albeck of
the Institute's Structural Biology Department, together with
Dr. Giuseppe Falini of the Italian University of Bologna, have
shown that the mollusks control the formation of the appropriate
crystal type by manufacturing two different "support" proteins,
each specializing in a different crystal type. These proteins
then go on to regulate the entire process of determining which
type of crystal goes where.

<HEADLINE> Pandemonium Breaks Out At IPC Office In Eastern Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Pandemonium broke out near the
Inter-Party Cooperation (IPC) Office in the eastern Ugandan town
of Mbale yesterday when local defence units forces fired in the
air to disperse a mammoth crowd.
</P>
<P>
Shooting started barely 30 minutes after presidential hopeful
Paul Ssemogerere arrived at the town to address the crowd,
according to a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Many people, including an IPC member, Florence Nakiganda, were
injured as people scampered off for cover, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted some interviewees as saying the commotion
was sparked off by a government vehicle which drove into the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
As the IPC members questioned the driver, he sped off around a
bend.
</P>
<P>
The report said that within moments, sporadic gunfire broke
out and people were fleeing in different directions.
</P>
<P>
On arrival at the town, Ssemogerere was warned not to violate
the relevant laws pertaining to presidential campaigns and barred
from making any comment by the IPC members.
</P>
<P>
The Mbale Resident District Representative, Matthias Akabwai,
last Friday issued a directive stopping Ssemogerere from opening
the office or holding any other activities.
</P>
<P>
Akabwai accused the IPC of circulating a subversive and
clandesting document attacking President Yoweri Museveni. enditem

<HEADLINE> Military Offensive Imminent In North Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sources said that a major military build-up is under way in
the north for what is being billed to be the largest ever
government troops offensive to re-capture more territory currently
held by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) separatist
movement.
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of the offensive, the LTTE is reportedly
engaged in a frenzy of defensive preparations and cadre training
programs.
</P>
<P>
Defense officials are tight-lipped about the dates of the
operation and the targeted area but acknowledge a massive
concentration of troops and equipment in the north, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the offensive is expected to be
larger than the "Operation Riviresa" last November which ended in
the re-capture of Jaffna city and several districts of the Jaffna
peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The new offensive is also likely to involve tens of thousands
of troops, armored columns and combined operations with aerial and
naval support and elite special forces units, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE is reportedly already aware of the build-up and are
busy with their own preparations to resist the expected government
offensive.
</P>
<P>
Intelligence has been received of a frenzy of training activity
in the jungles of the Mullaitivu district, especially around
remote Nedunkerni, which is now the nerve center of the LTTE,
according to Defense Ministry sources.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting against the government for a
separate Tamil state in the northeast of Sri Lanka since 1983.
More than 50,000 people have been killed in the country's ethnic
war.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) states are currently considering holding a meeting to agree
on measures necessary for preventing "mad cow" disease from
reaching the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a member of
the GCC, reaffirmed its ban on the import of slaughtered and live
cows as well as other related products from Britain, which has
been in effect since the issue of a ministerial decision of 1990,
according to today's newspaper Emirates News based here.
</P>
<P>
The GCC also groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar and
Oman.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a UAE technical committee in charge of checking the
validity of foodstuffs, is following up all developments
pertaining to the "mad cow" disease which will be discussed here
today.
</P>
<P>
Thus far, some countries have banned imports of British
beef. They include Egypt, Austria, Cyprus, Finland, Germany,
Italy, New Zealand, Qatar, Singapore, South Africa, Spain,
Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Portugal and Sweden.

<HEADLINE> Indians Warned of Heath Hazard from KFC, Burger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Indians have been warned that
the intake of the Kentucky Fried Chicken and Macdonnels Hamburgers
might cause mad cow disease as it has happened in Britain which
claimed 10 lives, the National Herald reported today.
</P>
<P>
Michael. W. Fox, vice president of the Humane Society of the
United States (HSUS), made the warning at a press conference here
Friday organized by the Vegetarian Society of Delhi.
</P>
<P>
Fox said the two multi-national companies have a history of
farm animal abuse like feeding the cows the remains of the cattle
or injecting them with drug-like clen buterol, for more production
of milk and meat, which could endanger Indians, too.
</P>
<P>
He cited the example of England where the government have
decided to slaughter cows numbering to 11 millions because of the
menace of the mad cow disease known to scientists as "Bovine
Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE)" which has allegedly killed ten
people.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about how the disease started in England, he said, the
big farmers fed the sheep brain to the cattle as a protein and
this is against the nature of the cows as they are basically
vegetarians.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, he said, farmers make cows muscular by
injecting them with anabolic steroids clen buterol.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Vegetarian Society of Delhi said India was
also offered the drug clen buterol for cows but the country
vehemently opposed the step.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Presidential Aide Arrested for Taking Bribes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 24 (Xinhua) -- One close aide of South Korean
President Kim Young-sam was arrested last night on suspicion of
taking bribes from businessmen, the Seoul District Prosecutor's
Office (SDPO) said today.
</P>
<P>
Chang Hak-ro, 45, is suspected of having received 180,000
U.S. dollars in bribes from three businessmen operating small
firms.
</P>
<P>
Chang will face charges of violating the Law on Aggravated
Punishment of Special Crimes.
</P>
<P>
On March 21, South Korea's main opposition party, the National
Congress for New Politics (NCNP), alleged that Chang has about
4.76 million U.S. dollars of assets hidden under the names of his
mistress and her brothers.
</P>
<P>
However, prosecutors said today that they have yet to find
evidence that Chang is the actual owner of all of the 4.76 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Chang was appointed presidential secretary in February 1993
when President Kim took office.
</P>
<P>
The assistant minister-level secretary, whose tasks are to take
care of the president's personal matters, resigned immediately
after the NCNP's allegations.
</P>
<P>
The scandal could deal a severe blow to the clean-up drive in
officialdom initiated by Kim, who has vowed not to have
received even a penny from businessmen upon his inauguration.

ABU DHABI, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The gross domestic product
(GDP) of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) grew by 6.6 percent in
1995 over the previous year, according to a report from the
Planning Ministry obtained here today.
</P>
<P>
The report said the UAE's GDP rose to 39.3 billion U.S. dollars
in 1995 from 36.88 billion dollars in 1994 due to a growth in
all areas of the economy as oil prices rose to some 16.8 dollars
a barrel from 15.5 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The UAE produces 2.16 million barrels of crude a day.
</P>
<P>
Its trade balance had a surplus of 3.93 billion dollars in
1995 as exports stood at 28.93 billion dollars and imports at 25
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The report said the total national income increased to 32.5
billion dollars in 1995 from 30 billion dollars in 1994. However,
per capita income remained unchanged at 16,557 dollars in 1995
because of population growth.

<HEADLINE> Jockey Club's Stable Security Camera System Flawed: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The security cameras in the
Shan Tin stable of French trainer Patrick Biancone do not cover
the feed room where the prohibited substance which showed up in
six of his horses was supposed to be mixed, according to a Hong
Kong newspaper report today.
</P>
<P>
The blank spot in stable surveillance is common in all Sha Tin
yards and the hours of footage shot by the cameras and currently
viewed by the trainer, racing department and security department
officials, may well prove to be useless, the South China Morning
Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
Some trainers yesterday confirmed the siting of the cameras and
one was quoted by the English-language newspaper as saying: "When
prescribed medication is put into a horse's feed it is obviously
done in the feed room set aside for that purpose so if they are
hoping to see somebody bunging into Patrick's feeding tubs they'll
be watching for a long time."
</P>
<P>
While not commenting on the position of the security cameras in
the stable, David Twynham, the Security Controller of the Jockey
Club, Said: "We are happy with the cameras that we have in the
stables."
</P>
<P>
Tests continue on samples taken from all horses in Biancone's
stable with an official announcement on any further positive swabs
due on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Jockey Club officials are not commenting on the biggest
drug-related scandal in the 24-year-long history of professional
horse racing in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Three horses from Biancone's stable were ordered to be
withdrawn from yesterday's races because they were earlier tested
positive of Dembrexine, a banned substance.

<P>
NEW DELHI, March 24 (Xinhua) -- India's major opposition
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will announce the first list of
candidates for the coming parliamentary elections on March 27, the
Sunday Times of India reported today.
</P>
<P>
Announcing this, BJP President L.K. Advani told reporters in
Jaipur, Rajasthan, on Saturday that the party would enter into an
electoral alliance with some parties.
</P>
<P>
He said the party's national election committee, which would
meet in New Delhi from Sunday, would decide on this issue.
</P>
<P>
Advani said the party had received several proposals from
various parties at the regional and national level for poll
understanding and it would decide on such proposals during the
two-day New Delhi meeting.
</P>
<P>
Advani, who was in Jaipur on the last leg of his shortened
election trip, asserted that the ruling Congress party would not
be able to cut much ice during the forthcoming elections on the
issue of stability, a major plank of the Congress party's
election manifesto.
</P>
<P>
The BJP, on the other hand, had emerged as a strong political
outfit and was capable of forming a stable government, he added.
</P>
<P>
The BJP will contest 475 of the 543 seats of the 11th Lok Sabha
(lower house of parliament) in the coming elections scheduled to
be held on April 27-May 21.

The gas is reportedly lying undiscovered just below the
continental shelf off the east and west coast of India.
</P>
<P>
The revelation was made recently in an interaction with Indian
exploration experts by renowned Russian geo-scientist N. Mokogon
after scrutinizing preliminary seismic data.
</P>
<P>
Mokogon claims that the reserves are lying at the sub-surface,
just below the waters of the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, at
a point where India's continental shelf tapers off into deeper
waters.
</P>
<P>
The reserves are not in the form of free gas but are in solid
form -- in a mixture of gas and water, which is commonly known as
hydrates. The latter is formed when gas and water combine at low
temperatures and high pressure.
</P>
<P>
India's public sector exploration giant, Oil and Natural Gas
Commission (ONGC), has hired Mokogon as a consultant after his
astounding assessment. Mokogon will now conduct more studies on
what is the exact size and location of the gas reserves.
</P>
<P>
India's current recoverable reserves are only around 700
billion metric cubic meters. the average daily exploitation rate
is only 55 million metric cubic meters of gas per day. By the
year 2000, the demand could be well of the order of 240 million
metric cubic meters per day.

title with a unanimous decision over his compatriot Yober Ortega
in Miami, on Saturday.

<P>
The three judges scored the 12-round bout 115-114, 116-115 and

Cremeno said that Ortega was real difficult and real strong,
but he promoised that next time he would be more polished.

SUZHOU, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The basic construction of the
Industrial Zone in this major city in east China's Jiangsu
province, is being carried out smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Calling the zone "the hope" of Suzhou's further economic
development, a local official said that the construction of the
zone has been listed high on the government's work scheme, as it
will be considered as the model for Suzhou's economy in the next
few years.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the overall plan of the three parts of the
zone has been drawn up with Singaporean co-operation.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the first phase of the three-sq-km initial
part has been completed, with 2.5 million cu m of earth having
been moved.
</P>
<P>
So far, 12 roads and nine bridges, as well as standard
workshops and commercial buildings have also been built.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a small-scale power plant has been built, while the
construction of a waterworks and sewage treatment plant is in full
swing.

<HEADLINE> China to Step up Development of Fast Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Internal
Trade will take steps to solve the problem of a growing number of
fast food consumers and a limited supply of fast food, especially
those who provide Chinese-style fast food.
</P>
<P>
Ministry sources said recently that the country's fast food
market is maturing, with the emergence of Chinese-style fast food
following on the heels of western-style food in recent years, but
the supply still just does not meet demand.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese fast food business started with very slow growth,
mainly because of lack of equipment, technology, investment, and
some backward consumer notions in the country, ministry
authorities pointed out.
</P>
<P>
To remedy this, the ministry plans to allocate funds for the
technical renovation of small and medium-sized fast food
enterprises and will come up with an overall plan to put the
industry on a healthy development track.
</P>
<P>
As an important step, a fair will soon be sponsored by the
ministry in Beijing to exhibit international fast food equipment,
decor materials for restaurants, and management systems.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 24 (Xinhua) -- This capital of south China's
Guangdong Province is to build a new airport to gradually replace
its overburdened Baiyun International Airport in the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
The new airport, which will be located about 30 km north of
downtown Guangzhou, is designed to handle 1.6 million takeoffs and
landings, 27 million passengers and 740,000 tons of cargo each
year.
</P>
<P>
The whole project is expected to cost 14.8 billion yuan (about
1.78 billion US dollars). An expressway connecting the airport and
the downtown district will cost another 4.7 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Baiyun Airport, one of the top three airports in China, is
bearing increasing pressure because of the fast grow of passenger
and cargo volumes in recent years.
</P>
<P>
While waiting for the central government's approval for the
construction plan, the local government has already started the
preparatory work.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary General
Boutros Boutros Ghali arrived here today to start his five-day
official visit to China.
</P>
<P>
Ghali, accompanied by his wife Lea Boutros Ghali and UN Under
Secretary General Jin Yongjian, was greeted at the airport by
Chinese vice-Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing and other officials.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the airport, Ghali told reporters that he
was happy to be in the Chinese capital again. "The main purpose of
my visit to China is to reinforce the relations between China and
the United Nations," he said, adding that the relations between UN
and China are already quite important.
</P>
<P>
"China is a permanent member of the UN Security Council and has
the right to veto. The strengthening of the relations between
China and the United Nations is in the interests of the whole
international community," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Ghali said that for many years he has tried to pay an annual
visit to China so that "we will be able through direct contacts
with the Chinese leaders to reinforce the relations between the
United Nations and China."
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he would discuss the Taiwan issue with the
Chinese leaders during his current trip, Ghali said, "Taiwan issue
is an internal issue of China," and the UN General Assembly has
adopted a series of resolutions to this effect.
</P>
<P>
Ghali is expected to hold talks with Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and meet Chinese top leaders during
his stay in the Chinese capital.

<HEADLINE> Indian PM in Dilemma over Hawala-Tainted Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha
Rao appears to be on the horns of a dilemma on whether to give
tickets to the Hawala-tainted ministers, the Sunday Times reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The Hawala case is a 18-million-US-dollar bribery scandal in
which some politicians allegedly received money from illegal
foreign exchange dealers. Seven ministers of the Narasimha Rao
government have resigned over alleged involvement in it.
</P>
<P>
According to the Sunday Times report, Rao has to decide latest
by March 30 because the last date for filing nominations is April
3. Party circles are hoping he will decide soon as the opposition
Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) is almost ready with its list of
candidates.
</P>
<P>
The dilemma arises, said the ruling Congress party sources,
because if Rao gives them tickets, the opposition will go hammer
and tongs at the party in the ensuring Lok Sabha (lower house of
parliament) elections and the assembly elections in half a dozen
states. Besides, the public perception of Rao being "a crusader
against corruption" will evaporate.
</P>
<P>
If Rao denies them tickets, he possibly stands to lose as many
seats because most or all of the Hawala-tainted ministers are
perceived as "sure winners" in their respective constituencies.
Congress party circles said whether the former ministers are given
tickets or not, they are bound to contest, even as independents,
if need be.
</P>
<P>
In the event of a close finish in terms of party standings,
where every seat may count, a denial of nominations may be
hazardous for the Congress party.

HONG KONG, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Cigarette smuggling cases in

<HEADLINE> No-Confidence Motion Likely to Be Defeated in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 24 (Xinhua) -- A no-confidence motion against
the Nepali three-party government seems likely to be defeated by a
narrow majority in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The no-confidence motion, tabled by the main opposition
Communist Party of Nepal (UML) in a special house session, was
expected to be put to vote in the lower house later today.
</P>
<P>
The National Democratic Party (RPP), the second ruling party in
the coalition government led by Sher Bahadur Deuba, Saturday
issued a whip ordering all its 19 MPs to vote against the
opposition motion.
</P>
<P>
However, RPP parliamentary party leader Lokendra Bahadur Chand
on the same day criticized the whip, saying RPP MPs were not
subject to conform with the directive believed to be exercised by
party president Surya Bahadur Thapa.
</P>
<P>
Chand and Thapa had different views on the no-confidence motion
as Chand stands for RPP's withdrawal from the ruling coalition
while Thapa opposed the no-confidence motion.
</P>
<P>
RPP MPs have been divided into two camps loyal to the two top
leaders respectively and five ministers from RPP's Chand faction
had reportedly resigned from the coalition cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The third ruling party Nepal Goodwill party had said earlier it
would reject the motion against the ruling coalition led by the
Nepali Congress (NC) party.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Nepal Workers and Peasants party (NWPP)
announced today that it would abstain from the house voting on the
UML motion scheduled for later today.
</P>
<P>
The NWPP party, with its 3 MPs in the Lower House, holds the
key to the no-confidence motion under present situation as the 19
 RPP MPs have actually divided into two groups with opposing
choices.
</P>
<P>
NWPP's announcement to quit the voting leaves few chances for
the no-confidence motion to be passed in the 205-seat house where
the main ruling NC and the main opposition UML have 86 and 88
seats respectively.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia to Expand Cooperation With China, Leader Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia will strengthen and
expand its cooperation with China, Prime Minister Puntsagiyn
Jaspay said in a recent interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"My forthcoming visit to China is another step to develop the
good-neighborly relations and cooperation between the two
countries, and a follow-up to the traditional bilateral high-level
meetings and talks," said Jaspay, who is scheduled to visit China
on March 27-30.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the common efforts of the two countries, he said, the
Mongolian-Chinese relations have been expanded over past years.
</P>
<P>
He noted the two countries have achieved concrete results in
developing their long-term stable cooperation in economy and
trade, culture and education, science and technology, public
health, environment protection, transportation and
telecommunication.
</P>
<P>
The Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between the People's
Republic of Mongolia and the People's Republic of China, signed
during Chinese Premier Li Peng's visit to Mongolia in April 1994,
is a significant document which set forth the principles governing
relations between the two countries, the prime minister said.

Speaking on the current economic situation in the country,
Jaspay said his government has taken a series of measures to
surmount difficulties occurring in the period of economic
transition.

<P>
The country's gross domestic product, which had dropped
successively in 1990-93, increased by 2.3 percent in 1994 and 6.3
percent in 1995, he added.

<HEADLINE> HK Study Shows Laser Eye Surgery "Ineffective" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Laser surgeries to correct
severe shortsightedness are largely ineffective, according to a
study conducted by a Hong Kong clinic.
</P>
<P>
Today's Hong Kong Standard reported that the study showed 71
percent of those treated for severe myopia suffered declining
vision within two years of surgery.
</P>
<P>
One eye surgeon not associated with the study said that
treatment following laser surgery could lead to serious eye
disorders, and laser surgery "was only good for mild myopia".
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Hong Kong Society for the Prevention of
Blindness, Dr. Tong Pak-chuen, who conducted the study, said it
had proved the surgery to be highly effective in mild myopia cases
but more progress had to be made in correcting severe myopia.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Tong's survey was based on 51 eyes of 30 patients who
received treatment between October 1992 and November 1993 and were
monitored for two years after surgery.
</P>
<P>
Results were given to international experts from Asia, America
and Europe at a two-day eye surgery symposium held in Hong Kong
this week.
</P>
<P>
More people in Hong Kong suffer varying degrees of myopia than
anywhere else in the world, according to the report.

said.
</P>

The U.S. government's allegation that Thai police tortured

</P>
<P>
Amarin also rejected allegations that Thailand has no laws

</P>
<P>
The Thai police officer made these remarks after the U.S.
government, in its annual report on human rights published
recently, accused Thailand of violating human rights through
police brutality and prostitution.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Lures More Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment in this major
industrial base in north China has maintained its momentum even
though the country has abolished the preferential policies on
equipment imports for foreign-funded enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that during the first two months of this year
the newly invested foreign funds in the municipality reached 641
million US dollars, a rise of 3.3 percent over the same period of
last year.
</P>
<P>
According to a local official in charge of foreign economy and
trade, the transnational companies are still the mainstay of the
overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that last year, while most of the country
saw a downturn in the utilization of foreign funds, Tianjin saw an
upward trend in overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
He said that this indicates that foreign investment is moving
northward, and Tianjin is one of the hot spots for such investment
in north China.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin is the third-largest city in the country and also the
largest coastal port city in north China.
</P>
<P>
Though the readjustment of tariff rates may adversely affect
foreign investment to a certain extent, the official said, the
overall tariffs in China are on a downward trend.
</P>
<P>
"China's markets are now opening wider to overseas companies,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
So far, the municipality has approved the setting up of 9,600
foreign-funded companies, with contracted foreign investment of 12
billion US dollars. More than 3,000 companies are now in operation.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the local government will pay close
attention to the improvement of the investment environment this
year, the key to which is to cancel arbitrary charges levied on
foreign-funded companies.

<HEADLINE> Chile to Enter Mercosur in June, Foreign Minister Confirm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Chilean Foreign Minister Jose
Miguel Insulza confirmed here today that Chile will enter the
South American Common Market (Mercosur) by signing a free trade
agreement with the group on June 25.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur, consisting of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and
Uruguay, was established early last year to foster economic
integration in Latin America and accelarate regional economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Insulza said President Eduardo Frei will
not permit his presidential prerogatives of signing an agreement
to be limited, and that the president will sign it, with or
without the support of the Congress.
</P>
<P>
Insulza explained that the government will inform the National
Congress about the pacts implied in Mercosur, for the legislative
body to emit its conclusions and observations.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean foreign minister recalled that the government and
President Frei himself have said that Latin American integration,
and especially in its neighborly context, "is the first priority
of its foreign policy."
</P>
<P>
The top diplomat stressed everything indicates that
negotiations on Chile's Mercosur entry will be successful, and
reiterated that "the date defined for the signing of the agreement
in Buenos aires is June 25 of this year."

<HEADLINE> Wooden, Bamboo Tablets Contain China's Earliest Archives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIANYUNGANG, March 24 (Xinhua) -- A number of wooden and bamboo
tablets unearthed in Donghai County, near Lianyungang City in east
China's Jiangsu Province three years ago have been identified as
China's earliest and most complete local government archives.
</P>
<P>
Studies of the 133 bamboo tablets and 23 wooden ones were
completed by experts from the Beijing and Fudan Universities and
the Chinese Academy of Sciences using the latest techniques in
February this year.
</P>
<P>
More than 40,000 Chinese characters on the tablets have been
identified, according to Liu Hongshi, curator of the Lianyungang
Museum. The tablets, which record in detail the governmental
organization, titles, promotions and demotions and other official
activities in Donghai Prefecture over 2,000 years ago, are
precious material for the study of the local administrative system
of the Western Han Dynasty (206 B.C.-24 A.D.).
</P>
<P>
They were found in a Han Dynasty tomb in Donghai County in
February 1993. One of the wooden tablets carries over 4,000
Chinese characters, which could only be discerned under a
magnifying glass. How they were written on the tablet is still a
riddle.
</P>
<P>
Judging from other unearthed articles, including embroidery,
bronze, jade, pottery, bone and lacquer ware, as well as coins,
the occupant of the tomb was a senior official.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications will
issue four stamps to mark the 13th international archives
conference, to be held in China in September this year. One stamp
will feature a picture of one of the tablets.
</P>
<P>
An international conference on the tablets will also be held in
Lianyungang in August this year.

<HEADLINE> Uruguay Expects To Increase Beef Sales to Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Uruguay is planning to
increase beef export to Europe as many European countries have
banned British beef due to the "mad cow" disease, the local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Uruguay, Argentina and Brazil are good alternatives to supply
beef to the European market, said the president of the Uruguayan
Chamber of the Meat Freezing Industry, Daniel Belerati.
</P>
<P>
He said the "mad cow" disease is absent in the southernmost
part of South America because the import of beef and related
products from Europe has been halted since 1986 when Britain
admitted the existence of the disease.
</P>
<P>
The "mad cow" disease, formally known as Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy, is said to be able to damage the human brain and
eventually cause death.

<HEADLINE> Former French President Expects EMU to Start on Time </HEADLINE>

BONN, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Former French President Velery
Giscard d'Estaing said today that the single European currency
must go ahead as planned in 1999; otherwise it will be impossible
to put the system in place.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the German weekly magazine "Der Spiegel,"
d'Estaing urged European Union (EU) members not to give up the
timetable for the the European Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
He said five to eight countries should be in the monetary union
when it introduces the single currency in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The "ins" should at least comprise Germany, France, the
Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and even Austria, Italy and
Spain, he added.
</P>
<P>
But his view was challenged by Minister-President of the Land
lower Saxony Gerhard Schroeder, who reportedly called for delaying
the creation of the EMU in the face of widespread recession across
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Some experts had also suggested that the creation of the EMU be
put off, fearing that most member countries would not recover from
economic slump to meet the criteria for 3 percent deficit-to-GDP
and 60 percent public debt-to-GDP.

<P>
BELGRADE, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian government released
109 Serb prisoners of war (POWs) from a Tuzla jail Saturday
shortly before a midnight deadline, said reports from Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted the International Committee of the Red Cross
(ICRC) as saying in a statement that the ICRC had monitored the
release of the prisoners, who were taken to a crossing point near
Gracanica.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian government released the POWs in accordance with an
agreement reached in Geneva last week by leaders of Bosnia,
Croatia and Serbia on the release of remaining prisoners of war by
midnight Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the ICRC, a total of 152 POWs not suspected of war
crimes had been detained by Bosnia's former warring parties, with
129 by the Moslem-led Bosnian government and 23 by the Bosnian
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Another 62 POWs are held by the former warring parties for
possible war crime investigations.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton peace agreement reached last November, all
prisoners of war should have been released by January 19.
</P>
<P>
Colum Murphy, a spokesman for European High Representative Carl
Bilt, said in Sarajevo that the release Saturday should not be
viewed as full compliance with the Dayton peace accord, noting
that the Bosnia government is still holding 26 POWs in Tuzla.

<HEADLINE> Fujian Sets up 3,300-km Coastal Shelterbelt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Fujian Province in east China has
built a 3,300-km coastal shelterbelt during the past eight years
in a bid to protect farmland.
</P>
<P>
About 1.4 million ha of land has been covered with trees in 28
coastal counties or cities, 70 percent more than the planned
first-phase target. This has brought their forest coverage rate to
43 percent.
</P>
<P>
Fujian mapped out a 10-year plan to cover 429,000 ha of land
with trees in 1988 along the coast, thus forming a green
shelterbelt.
</P>
<P>
Rampant wind, sand, drought and flooding caused 400,000 ha of
beach to lie idle in the coastal province and 1,000 km long saline
land along the coast.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said the afforestation project had greatly
reduced the effect caused by wind, sand, drought and flooding
along the coast.
</P>
<P>
They went on to say that Pingtan Island, which is located on
the northwest coast of the Taiwan Straits, used to suffer strong
wind for at least 100 days and serious desertification had forced
many villages to relocate. Eighteen villages were once buried
overnight by sand.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the afforestation project, 1,300 ha of eroded
farmland on the island has been reclaimed and a similar amount of
new farmland has been opened.

<HEADLINE> Peach Blossom County in Hunan Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Once it was known as
an 'out-of-this-earth peach garden'. It earned the name because of
its backwardness, and freedom from rule by the emperor.
</P>
<P>
The "garden" was even more well-known after a prose was written
entitled "Origin of the Land of Peach Blossoms" by Tao Yuanming, a
famous writer of Jin Dynasty (265 - 420 A.D), which described the
place as a paradise without human turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Now the county of Taoyuan about 250 km away from the capital
city of central China's Hunan province is known as a major tourist
attraction, thanks to its out of this world history.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, the county has seen a tourist craze as
modern-day Chinese people have been heading to the land of peach
blossoms.
</P>
<P>
Aiming to increase the procession of tourists the county has
successfully hosted four international garden-visiting festivals,
and has welcomed nearly four million visitors.
</P>
<P>
A fifth festival is scheduled to start for a ten-day period,
from the 28th of this month to April 6th.
</P>
<P>
This year's event hopes to attract investment from overseas and
domestic business people. During the festival there will be local
performances, a calligraphy and painting exhibition, and a tourism
product fair.
</P>
<P>
With nearly 100 scenic spots, covering more than 10 sq km, the
county has been listed as one of the province's 10 famous tourist
resorts, and a provincial-level tourism development zone.
</P>
<P>
The past four events held in the zone brought in tens of
millions of yuan in tourism income, and a jump in the number of
foreign-funded enterprises.
</P>
<P>
To cater to the demand of tourists, the county has set up eight
hotels, and more than 300 enterprises engaged in commercial
business, catering, and the processing of tourism products.

city official said recently.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Mayor Tan Yongqing said that the projects will give top
priority to transportation, water and cooking gas supply, housing
and the protection of natural springs -- for which the city is
well-known in China.
</P>
<P>
All the projects are connected with the city's social and
economic development, he said.
</P>
<P>
One project will reduce the amount of dirty water flowing into
Daming Lake, one of the city's attractions, by 90 percent. Three
roads will be built or expanded, including an elevated highway 4.5
km long and 18.5 m wide running through the city from north to
south.
</P>
<P>
In addition, an underground shopping city with a construction
area of 20,000 sq m will be built. A total investment of 400
million yuan will be put into the construction of three
residential communities. Another 400 million yuan will be spent on
a new reservoir, the official said.

<P>
TAIYUAN, March 24 (Xinhua) -- International exchanges have
vitalized the agricultural research in north China's Shanxi
Province.
</P>
<P>
The provincial academy of agricultural sciences is the only
professional research body of agricultural products storage
technology under the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences,
China's top agricultural research organ.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years the provincial academy has set up
relations of cooperation with universities and research institutes
in over 20 countries and regions, including the United States,
Australia, Japan, Germany and Canada.
</P>
<P>
The academy focuses on seed breeding and the introduction of
advanced applied techniques. The Sorghum Institute has introduced
nearly 6,000 samples of sorghum species, which have markedly
enriched China's genetic bank of sorghum.
</P>
<P>
In cooperation with universities in the United States, the
cotton and corn institutes introduced six anti-drought corn
species from the US, which are expected to improve local corn
output.
</P>
<P>
Qi Shouchun, a researcher at the Fruit Tree Research Institute,
made breakthroughs in apple storage technology during his research
tour of the United States. The achievement has been popularized in
six provinces and cities in China and yielded over one billion
yuan-worth of economic returns.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years the province has invited some 50
foreign scholars to give lectures, and successfully held the Fifth
International Seminar on Buckwheat.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb Officials, ICRC Discuss Release of POWs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb Prime Minister
Rajko Kasagic and ICRC representatives discussed at Serb
stronghold Pale today the release of remaining prisoners of war
(POWs) in line with the Dayton accord and agreements reached at a
recent conference on ex-Yugoslavia in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
The head of the the International Committee of the Red Cross
mission (ICRC) to the Serb state Republika Srpska, Pierre
Krahenbuhl, said that the release of POWs in Bosnia was the ICRC's
priority which should be ended in the days to come in a bid to
consolidate peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached in Geneva last week by leaders of
Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia, all three sides in Bosnia -- Serbs,
Muslims and Croats -- were expected to exchange all remaining POWs
by today.
</P>
<P>
An ICRC report said that there remained 214 POWs in Bosnia and
that more than half of them were Serbs. A Muslim prison in Tuzla
in northeastern Bosnia alone holds 129 Serbs, according to Tanjug
news agency.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton agreement signed in December last year, all
prisoners of war should have been released by January 19, 1996 at
the latest.
</P>
<P>
Kasagic said their meeting had also tackled the ICRC's aid to
the Serb people in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an IFOR spokesman said in Sarajevo today that a
refusal by the former foes in Bosnia to release the remaining POWs
would be a grave violation of the commitments they had undertaken
in Dayton and Geneva.
</P>
<P>
"IFOR demands all parties to meet the terms of the Dayton peace
accord and the agreement reached at Geneva meeting," IFOR
spokesman Gen. Andrew Cumming said.

Situated between the Qinling and Bashan mountains, the 1.4
million hectares of forest in the basin is home to such rare wild
animals as giant pandas and crested ibises.
</P>
<P>
During the past three years all the barren hills in the basin
have been covered with trees, including A 150 km-long, 34,000
hectares of pine forest along the southern bank of the Hanjiang
River and an 80 km-long, 6,700-ha metasequoia belt.
</P>
<P>
The forest coverage rate for the basin has been increased to
47.8 percent, compared with the national average of nearly 14
percent.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the local wildlife protection department
show that as the ecological environment has improved, about 20,000
rare wild animals of 180 species have immigrated or returned to
the basin.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the afforestation is not only beneficial for
wildlife, but also for the control of soil erosion and water
loss.

KUNMING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- A sample population survey in
southwest China's Yunnan Province shows that the total population
of the province reached 40 million by March 23 this year, seven
years late than expected, thanks to effective family planning
programs.
</P>
<P>
The survey was carried out by the Yunnan Provincial Statistics
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The population growth rate had dropped to 1.25 percent by 1995,
but the figure was still higher than the national average.
</P>
<P>
Due to special policies for minority-nationality groups, the
population growth rate of the ethnic people was higher than that
of the Han people. The percentage of ethnic-minority people in the
total population has risen from 31.7 percent in 1982 to the
current 34.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
When the People's Republic of China was established in 1949,
the population of the province was about 16 million.

<HEADLINE> U.S. President Asks Companies to Do Right by workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said today that companies which "do right by their employees" are
most likely to prosper and grow.
</P>
<P>
In his weekly radio address and a speech before a university
audience in Ohio, President Clinton called on the nation's
business community to do more to address the impact of corporate
downsizing and worker anxiety.
</P>
<P>
Clinton announced he will convene a meeting in Washington next
month of the chief executives of large American corporations that
he said have scored healthy profits while "doing right" by their
employees.
</P>
<P>
The president said he hopes the meeting can help create a
climate in which the vast majority of American businesses--large
and small--will come to understand that they can improve the
security of their employees while enhancing the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
He said his proposal is based on five pillars: adequate health
insurance, protected pensions, a partnership between workers and
management, quality skills training and a safe work place.
</P>
<P>
"Many of America's most successful businesses have shown that
you can do well by doing right by employees and their families,"
he said in the radio address.
</P>
<P>
In both his speech and radio address, the president called on
companies to establish "family friendly" policies.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton said that many American working families are
hurting despite economic gains in past years. "Too many Americans
are still working harder and harder just to keep up, and they
worry they'll be left behind by the new economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president made the speeches one day after workers at
two GM brake factories in Ohio ended their 17-day-long strike. The
strike resulted in the layoff and idling of tens of thousands GM
workers in North American assembly plants.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Americans Favor Higher School Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- A new poll indicates the
American people favor tougher school standards.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-five percent of people surveyed support higher
standards, reports the latest issue of U.S. News &AMP; World Report.
</P>
<P>
But only five percent of those surveyed consider low standards
as the most serious problem for public education.
</P>
<P>
The poll comes on the eve of a national education meeting. At
least 45 governors and dozens of executives from the nation's
largest corporations plan to meet in New York this week to revive
the school standards movement.
</P>
<P>
The Education Department has tried to implement those
recommendations, but its standards have been criticized by some as
emphasizing the wrong areas and too vague. Conservatives and some
state leaders have complained that the government was trying to
impose a national curriculum.
</P>
<P>
The poll suggests that the American people want standards, but
they are divided over whether national, state or local authorities
should set them.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-two percent said public education in the nation was fair,
poor or very poor, compared with 31 percent who said it was good
or excellent, the poll says.
</P>
<P>
Respondents were more optimistic about education in their local
schools, with 44 percent calling it good or excellent and 45
percent saying it is fair, poor or very poor.
</P>
<P>
Asked for the most serious problem in education, 34 percent of
people blamed parents' lack of involvement in their children's
education, followed by lack of discipline in the schools, lack of
funding and low standards, according to the poll.
</P>
<P>
The survey of 1,000 adults was conducted March 16-18 and has a
margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Moscow Confirms Russia, Belarus to Sign Union Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin and the President's spokesman Sergei Medvedv today
confirmed that Russia and Belarus will sign an integration treaty
on April 2.
</P>
<P>
Briefing on his seven-hour talks with Russian president Yeltsin
on Friday and his meeting with Chernomyrdin this morning, Belarus
President Alexander Lukashenko told reporters here earlier today
that the two former Soviet republics will make up a union state.
</P>
<P>
The Belarus leader came here on Friday and left for home after
he made this declaration.
</P>
<P>
Confirming this statement, Chernomyrdin told reporters later
that one of the key conditions for the signing of the
Russian-Belarus agreement on integration planned for April 2 is
that the two countries will remain sovereign.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Belarus will be represented in international
organizations as sovereign states, he added.
</P>
<P>
The name of the future formation between Russia and Belarus has
not been determined, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the draft agreement, Moscow and Minsk plan to form a
unified budget to which each of the two countries will make
certain contributions, Chernomyrdin said.
</P>
<P>
In 1996-1997, Russia and Belarus will have to decide on
introducing a unified currency, he said. However, this process
"may be long," he added.
</P>
<P>
The treaty on integration between Russia and Belarus will be
open for all CIS (the Commonwealth of Independent States)
countries, the Russian premier said. "We want others to join it."
</P>
<P>
He ruled out the possibility of postponing the presidential
elections in Russia in June because of the union treaty's signing,
saying that the conclusion of the treaty has nothing to do with
the forthcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yeltsin's Press Secretary Medvedev pointed out,
"Russia and Belarus are going to sign the treaty on deeper
integration, but this does not mean that any new state is in the
making."
</P>
<P>
Medvedev confirmed that the setting up of a supreme body to
chair the union were discussed during Lukashenko's working visit
to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The top body is to include the Russian and Belarus presidents,
prime ministers, speakers of parliaments and integration committee
chairman, the presidential spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The integration committee, Mededev clarified, is expected to be
a new "standing executive body to conduct the practical work and
ensure the activities of the new union."
</P>
<P>
Medvedev also confirmed that presidents of Russia, Belarus,
Kazakhstan and Kirghizia are expected to hold a summit meeting in
Moscow on March 29 to sign a package of integration documents.

LAGOS, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The West African Monetary Agency
(WAMA) is to work out modalities for a single monetary zone and a
common currency for members of the Economic Community of West

</P>
<P>
ECOWAS Executive Secretariat said today that the organization

The currencies now used in ECOWAS nations are not exchangeable

WAMA, a specialized agency of ECOWAS, was established under an
agreement signed by governors of central banks of West African
countries in Banjul, Gambia, on March 8.
</P>
<P>
An ECOWAS official explained that a common currency meant that
governors of central banks of ECOWAS nations would collectively
determine the amount of money to be put into circulation.
