<HEADLINE> Third Continental jet suffers engine failure on takeoff  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Federal regulators and the maker of a
popular engine for large jetliners are scrutinizing why the models
of the engine suffered uncommon failures on three separate takeoffs
of Continental Airlines aircraft since April.
</P>
<P>
   The airline and the manufacturer, GE Aircraft Engines, a unit of
General Electric Co., on Tuesday expressed confidence in the
engine.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating ''to
see if there is any common thread,'' NTSB spokesman Ted
Lopatkiewicz said. The agency has not issued a safety
recommendation on the engines.
</P>
<P>
   No injuries were reported during the incidents, which led to two
takeoffs being aborted. The other flight returned shortly after
takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   GE Aircraft Engines, of Cincinnati, suspects the failures are
linked to an exhaust nozzle at the rear of the engines, company
spokesman Rick Kennedy said. As the part came loose and rotated, it
wore away at the engine cases and caused parts to break loose, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, it appears we have a specific area that we're
focusing on ... to make sure it doesn't happen again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,400 of the CF6-50 engines, which are about 20 to 25
years old, are used on McDonnell Douglas DC-10s and early Boeing
747s around the world, many flying daily, Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very reliable engine. It's a workhorse of the
industry,'' he said. ''The overall operational safety of these
engines is very high.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on a recommendation GE issued after the first incident,
Continental has increased engine inspections on its 24 DC-10s,
airline spokesman David Messing said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of our maintenance meets or exceeds FAA requirements,
which are the toughest in the world,'' Messing said.
</P>
<P>
   Continental is responsible for routine maintenance on the
engines, while GE performs overhauls on the engines every few
years, Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the airline, nor the manufacturer, could immediately
provide the date on the last overhaul on the three engines that
failed this year.
</P>
<P>
   Each suffered a rare breakdown, called an uncontained engine
failure, in which parts penetrate the engine housing.
</P>
<P>
   Only 25 such failures happened in the United States from
1985-99. Two of the Continental incidents this year happened at
Newark International Airport, one of its hubs, while the third was
Thursday in Amsterdam. All involved DC-10s.
</P>
<P>
   The engines are designed to eject parts out the rear, which
poses less of a threat to the aircraft and its occupants, said
William D. Waldock, a professor of aeronautical science at
Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   The age of the engines is not a factor if they are maintained
properly, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The most common causes of engine failures are metal fatigue or
when birds are sucked into the engine. An unbalanced turbine blade
can also cause such a failure, but that is usually detected during
routine maintenance, Waldock said.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent engine failure was Thursday, when Flight 71 from
Amsterdam to Newark aborted its takeoff when one of its three
engines failed, the NTSB said.
</P>
<P>
   Just two days earlier, Flight 60 from Newark to Brussels,
Belgium, also aborted its takeoff with an engine failure.
</P>
<P>
   On April 25, Flight 60 returned to Newark after the engine under
the left wing spewed parts and knocked out a second engine.
</P>
<P>
   DC-10s can fly on only one engine if needed.
</P>
<P>
   After the April incident, GE advised operators to increase the
frequency of visual inspection of the nozzle area whenever the
engine cowling is removed, roughly every 100 to 200 hours of flight
operation, Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides visual and manual inspections, Continental will use
electronic equipment to test the engines, Messing said.
</P>
<P>
   In another incident, passengers and crew were removed on Sunday
from a Continental Boeing 737 at Newark because of an engine
warning.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot of Flight 675 to Kansas City shut the engine and
cleared the jet after seeing a warning light flash for the
left-wing engine, Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman
Arlene Salac said.
</P>
<P>
   The jet was towed to a hangar. The engine was restarted, and a
fire that started in an engine tailpipe about 9 a.m. was
extinguished by maintenance workers, Continental spokeswoman
Catherine Stengel said.
</P>
<P>
   The cause appeared to be fuel dripping from one engine, she
said.

<HEADLINE> Arthur Eve survives against Peoples; Three incumbents lose  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The dean of the state Assembly survived a tough
challenge from a fellow Democrat but at least three other
incumbents in the state Legislature lost their party's backing in
Tuesday's primary elections.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo Democrat Arthur Eve, seeking his 18th term in the
Assembly, bested the chairwoman of the Erie County Legislature,
Crystal Peoples, 7,470 or 51 percent to 6,627 or 46 percent,
according to unofficial returns from 91 percent of the precincts.
Samuel Herbert had 424 votes or 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think people when they went in the booth they had to say,
'Arthur Eve has delivered constantly for this community, for this
city, for the children, has provided opportunities for the young
people,''' a relieved Eve said.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in his long Assembly career, Eve had to run
television commercials as part of a re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But the Eve race brought down another Democratic incumbent. A
strong turnout in the areas of Buffalo where the Eve district
overlapped that of state Sen. Alfred Coppola gave Coppola's
opponent Byron Brown the victory. With 94 percent of the vote
counted unofficially, Brown had 13,585 votes or 54 percent to
11,343 votes or 46 percent for Coppola.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact of the matter is he ran a good campaign,'' said
Coppola, who took his seat earlier this year after former Sen.
Anthony Nanula was elected Buffalo city comptroller. ''I said it
earlier, I was on the (Buffalo city) council with him for four
years and I taught him everything he knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Coppola said he would run in November as the Conservative
candidate. Bob Woolworth is the Republican nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democratic incumbents losing Tuesday were Assemblyman
Nelson Denis in the Bronx and Bronx state Sen. David Rosado. In
addition, Brooklyn Democratic Assemblyman Edward Griffith was
behind in tight balloting.
</P>
<P>
   Denis lost to former New York City Councilman Adam Clayton
Powell IV in a three-way race. Powell, 38, is the son of the former
Harlem congressman who is seeking to get back into politics for the
first time since 1997. That year, Powell resigned his seat on the
New York City Council and ran unsuccessfully for Manhattan borough
president.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel awesome,'' Powell said Tuesday night. ''Basically,
people here are very intelligent. They are very smart and they
realize they did not have any representation in the state
Assembly.''
</P>
<P>
   With all precincts reporting, Powell had 5,882 votes or 53
percent to 4,410 votes or 40 percent for Denis. Frank Acosta, the
third candidate in the race, got 871 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Powell will face Republican Rose Pascale in November.
</P>
<P>
   The Rosado-Pedro Espada Jr. campaign for a state Senate seat in
the South Bronx was perhaps the most bitter of any legislative
primaries. Espada held the seat from 1992-96 before being unseated
by Rosado. Each candidate questioned the other's honesty.
</P>
<P>
   Espada faces prosecution in Bronx state Supreme Court for
allegedly diverting money from a health center he runs to help pay
for his 1996 race. Espada has contended that the prosecution is
being pressed by his opponents within the Bronx Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith, a 14-term veteran, trailed Diane Gordon 3,169 votes to
3,099 votes with 100 percent of the balloting unofficially
complete. Mary Warren had 1,356 votes.
</P>
<P>
   In Schenectady, Brian Stratton defeated Gerald Evans in a
Democratic primary to earn the right to meet incumbent Republican
state Sen. Hugh Farley in November. Stratton, a Schenectady city
councilman, is the son of the late longtime Congressman Sam
Stratton.
</P>
<P>
   In Brooklyn, Steven Cymbrowitz easily defeated Michael Hizme to
win the Democratic nomination to succeed his wife Lena Cymbrowitz
in the state Assembly. Lena Cymbrowitz died at age 43 in August
while in her first term in the Assembly. Steven Cymbrowitz will
face Republican Fred Fields in November in the heavily Democratic
district.
</P>
<P>
   There were only two Republican legislative primaries of
significance Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Staten Island, Robert DiCarlo led Charles Capetanakis in
their race for the Republican nomination for state Senate. DiCarlo,
who lost the seat in 1996 to Democrat Vincent Gentile, was seeking
another chance against Gentile in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   With 91 percent of the vote counted, DiCarlo led with 2,058
votes or 53 percent to 1,794 votes or 47 percent for Capetanakis.
</P>
<P>
   In the state's Finger Lakes region, incumbent Assemblyman George
Winner easily defeated Chemung County Legislator Sidney Graubard in
a Republican primary. Winner, an 11-term veteran, has no Democratic
opponent in November.
</P>
<P>
   The long-serving Eve, 67, had always been counted on to speak
out passionately in debates in favor of social spending for
impoverished New Yorkers and against measures he felt would
victimize young African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Elected to the Assembly in 1966, he often referred to his role
during the 1971 Attica prison uprising, when he was one of the
observers let into the barricaded portion of the facility to hear
inmate grievances before the bloody retaking of the prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''The thing that people (opponents) are saying is that it's time
for a change, but they don't give any basis for it, in that I'm not
effective,'' Eve said on the eve of the primary. ''Seniority is
very important and I'm part of the leadership in Albany. That's
very important.''
</P>
<P>
   Peoples, 48, was careful during the campaign not to personally
attack the political institution Eve has become, saying she had
''no disrespect to the gentleman.''
</P>
<P>
   But Peoples said Eve's legislative agenda was a throwback to the
days of looking for social programs to address people's problems.
She suggested Eve had been slow to promote economic growth in the
district with initiatives to create new businesses and jobs.

<HEADLINE> Voters OK Lambeau Field Tax Plan  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT IMRIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Voters approved a half-percent sales tax
to help the Green Bay Packers renovate Lambeau Field, clearing the
way for the team to start construction in January.
</P>
<P>
   With 96 percent of Brown County's precincts reporting, 46,386
voters, or 53 percent, voted for the tax to raise $160 million for
the $295 million project. There were 40,947 votes against it.
</P>
<P>
   The county will start collecting the tax Nov. 1, Packers
president Bob Harlan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going to have the finest stadium in the NFL,'' Harlan
said at the Stadium View Sports Bar and Grill in Green Bay, where
400 team supporters gathered Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''America's team still resides in Green Bay, Wis.''
</P>
<P>
   Long before the final votes were counted, a cheer went up at the
Stadium View Sports Bar when WBAY televised its exit poll, which
projected the sales tax would pass.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have Vince Lombardi looking over us,'' said Larry Primeau,
known as ''Packalope'' for the antler-adorned helmet he wears.
</P>
<P>
   Voters also decided whether money generated by the tax in excess
of that needed for the renovation should go toward county services.
With 96 percent of precincts reporting, 47,872, or 55 percent,
opposed that idea, and 38,470, or 45 percent, voted for it.
</P>
<P>
   By passing the first question and rejecting the second, voters
decided the additional tax revenue will be used to retire the
Lambeau Field debt years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The sales-tax vote had been projected as a close one, pitting
voters' love of the Packers against their pocketbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Officials had predicted the turnout would be high, with perhaps
80 percent of the county's more than 160,000 eligible voters going
to the polls. By Monday, some 2,100 people had cast absentee
ballots in Green Bay, more than the number of absentee votes in the
presidential election in November 1996, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Tomashek of Ashwaubenon said he supported the tax because he
wants his children and grandchildren to watch the Packers play at
Lambeau Field.
</P>
<P>
   ''Truthfully, without the Packers, this would be like a ghost
town,'' he said. ''You might as well board up all the hotel
rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   The Packers announced the $295 million renovation in January,
saying it would expand the 43-year-old stadium's capacity to 71,100
seats by adding 10,000 more, modernize the stadium with more
bathrooms and concessions stands and add a mall-like atrium for the
Packers Hall of Fame, Packer Pro Shop, stadium club and other
amenities.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers hope to finish the project in 2003 so the stadium
could be used year-round and provide at least a 25-year fix to the
team's growing financial worries.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Tommy Thompson said the Legislature now should approve $9
million for infrastructure improvements such as roads and utilities
for the project.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the start of a new day for the Green Bay Packers
franchise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers, founded in 1919, argued Lambeau Field was crumbling
and needed to be modernized. The team said it desperately needed to
generate more revenue from the stadium to remain financially
competitive in the NFL and be able to afford escalating players
salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Critics countered that taxpayers' money should not be used to
finance a private business, and they argued the project was too
lavish and may not accomplish what the Packers wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really don't think they presented a financial picture that
warrants Brown County residents to pay so much for the stadium,''
said Jim Frink of the Brown County Taxpayers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Many critics said there were other ways to finance the
improvements, including collecting taxes from more than just one
county, and perhaps selling naming rights to Lambeau Field for up
to $120 million.
</P>
<P>
   The referendum was the first public vote on the venerable
stadium since April 1956, when Green Bay voters, by a 2-to-1
margin, approved bonds to build it for $960,000.

<HEADLINE> Strong Quake Jolts Indonesia Island  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- A strong offshore earthquake shook the
southwest coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra, seismologists
and residents said Wednesday. There were no reports of casualties
or major damage.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's Meteorology and Geophysics Agency said the magnitude
5.7 temblor hit at 11:27 p.m. local time Tuesday. Its epicenter was
beneath the Indian Ocean, 140 miles southwest of the town of
Bengkulu, said seismologist Sutanto, who like many Indonesians uses
only one name.
</P>
<P>
   Seismologists at the Hong Kong Observatory estimated the quake's
magnitude at 6.1.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of tremors have rattled Bengkulu since June 4, when a
magnitude 7.9 quake killed at least 100 people and damaged hundreds
of buildings and homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is very normal to feel aftershocks nowadays. We don't panic
like we used to,'' said Can Cahayawati, a resident of Bengkulu,
about 300 miles northwest of Jakarta.

<HEADLINE> House votes on repealing federal charter of Boy Scouts  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - House Republicans, warning of an attack on
fundamental American values, on Tuesday berated a small group of
lawmakers proposing that the Boy Scouts' federal charter be revoked
because of the organization's policy toward gays.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats accused the GOP majority of a political stunt in
bringing a bill with no chance of passage to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   While the outcome of the vote on Wednesday is not in doubt, the
issue renewed the debate over the relationship between the Boy
Scouts and the federal government rising out of the group's stance
on excluding homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's chief sponsor, Rep. Lynn Woolsey, D-Calif., said she
was a Girl Scout and one of her sons was a Boy Scout. ''We're not
saying the Boy Scouts are bad; we're saying that intolerance is
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I know the value of scouting, and that's why I believe
scouting should be available to all boys, not just to some boys,''
said Woolsey, the only Democrat to speak in favor of the
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, one Republican after another rose in opposition.
''It's an attack on the fundamental values of America,'' said Rep.
Chris Cannon, R-Utah, led by ''a small group of extremists on the
minority side.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They truly ought to be ashamed,'' said Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga.,
of the ''denigration and assault on the Boy Scouts of America.''
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said in a statement
that he brought the bill to the floor without hearings or a
committee vote ''to demonstrate the lack of support for those who
have declared open season on the Boy Scouts.''
</P>
<P>
   Woolsey said she wasn't told until Monday evening that
Republicans were taking up her legislation. It ''was a total
surprise to me.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're disappointed that this bill would even be considered,''
countered Boy Scouts spokesman Gregg Shields. He said having a
federal charter is an honor and ''we hope to continue to live up to
that honor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boy Scouts of America got its federal charter in 1916, six
years after it was founded. It is one of about 90 groups with such
designation, an honorary title given to patriotic, charitable and
education organizations.
</P>
<P>
   While it confers no specific benefits, receiving a federal
charter is a mark of prestige and national recognition for a group.
Among other groups with federal charters are the American Legion,
Future Farmers of America, the National Tropical Botanical Garden
and the National Ski Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision in June, upheld the Boy
Scouts' ban on homosexuals serving as troop leaders. That ruling
may also give legal backing to the 6.2 million-member
organization's rejection of gay youths as members.
</P>
<P>
   The Scouts asserted that homosexual conduct is inconsistent with
the values it seeks to instill.
</P>
<P>
   But while the high court sided with the group's First Amendment
rights to ''expressive association,'' the Boy Scout relationship
with the federal government was brought into question when
President Clinton, five days before the ruling, issued an executive
order barring discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in
federally conducted education and training programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Department in August asked the Justice Department
for guidance on how that order affected the holding of Boy Scout
Jamborees on federal lands.
</P>
<P>
   GOP presidential nominee George W. Bush and other Republicans
quickly accused the administration of trying to throw the scouts
off federal lands. But Attorney General Janet Reno, in a statement
this month, said the tradition of Boy Scouts using federal lands
for camping and other activities could continue.
</P>
<P>
   Woolsey has also urged Clinton to resign as honorary president
of the Boy Scouts because of the policy toward gays. Her office
said the White House has not responded to that request. Shields
said every president since Taft has served as honorary president.
</P>
<P>
   After the June Supreme Court ruling, Clinton said he is
''generally against discrimination against gays.'' But he refused
to criticize the Scouts or the court's ruling. ''The Boy Scouts
still are - they're a great group. They do a lot of good.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill number is H.R. 4892.

<HEADLINE> Vaccinators Target Kids in Somalia  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE MWANGI
<TEXT>
<P>
   QANSADHERE, Somalia (AP) -- Somalia recorded the world's last
known case of smallpox more than two decades ago. Six thousand
workers fanning out across the country, vaccines in hand, hope
their beleaguered nation will not be the last to eradicate polio as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with batches of oral polio vaccine and bottles of liquid
Vitamin A, the workers headed into the field Tuesday. They hope to
reach 1.4 million children over the next three days in the nation
of an estimated 10 million people.
</P>
<P>
   That means each worker will have to deposit two drops of vaccine
and two drops of Vitamin A on the tongues of 233 kids under age 5.
</P>
<P>
   ''Somalia is still classified as a polio high-risk area by the
World Health Organization after several cases were diagnosed last
year,'' said Stephen Lauwerier, coordinator of the campaign
sponsored jointly by WHO and the U.N. children's agency, UNICEF.
''Somalia was the last place smallpox was eradicated in 1978, and
the local community doesn't want to be the last place where polio
is eradicated, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Awilyo Mohamed's 3-year-old daughter, Nasteexo, wailed along
with the other children when the drops hit her mouth, but her
mother said she was happy with the program.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't know about it at all until we heard about the
vaccinations on the radio,'' Mohamed said.
</P>
<P>
   The polio immunization program in Somalia, part of a
continent-wide program to kick polio out of Africa, began in 1997.
It has run into more problems than other national campaigns because
the country has been without a central government and nationwide
security since it plunged into civil war in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Lauwerier said parts of southern Somalia and the area including
the capital, Mogadishu, are not included in this year's initial
exercise because of lack of security. But he said organizers still
hope the entire country can be reached before the next two phases,
from Oct. 14-16 and Nov. 14-16, are completed.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a community, we ... are happy about the vaccination
exercise,'' said Mohamed Ali Asen Qalinle, governor of Baidoa, a
region to the east of this town.
</P>
<P>
   Until a year ago, Baidoa and the surrounding area had been
engulfed in fighting between opposing clan-based militias and had
missed out on the polio campaign. The governor said his
administration was helping mobilize people to bring their children
for treatment. His officials also are providing security for the
vaccinators, who have to travel long distances to isolated, dusty
villages where a long drought has ravaged the staple crops.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are trying our best to save our children from this mortal
disease,'' Qalinle said.

<HEADLINE> Vt. Lawmakers Trailing Over Gay Law  </HEADLINE>
By ROSS SNEYD
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- Vermont's civil unions law claimed its
victims Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Five Republican state legislators who supported the law granting
gay couples many of the rights and benefits of marriage either were
defeated or were trailing in their primaries. Three Republicans and
one Democrat who backed the law and were targeted for defeat
because of it survived.
</P>
<P>
   Among lawmakers who were challenged because of their opposition
to the law, one was defeated and another was re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   The primaries represented the first opportunity voters have had
to register their views since the Legislature earlier this year
enacted the closest thing in America to gay marriage. The results
Tuesday reflected the deep split in Vermont over the law.
</P>
<P>
   One of the chief authors of the bill, House Judiciary Committee
chairman Thomas Little, a Republican, beat back a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Granting marriage benefits to gay couples ''is probably
something that's going to take a generation to resolve,'' Little
said.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the biggest casualties among the law's supporters were
Marion Milne, who represents six conservative towns, and John
Edwards, who serves on the Judiciary Committee and represents a
couple of small towns on the Canadian border. Both had been
targeted by opponents of civil unions.
</P>
<P>
   Milne said that she knew when she cast her vote that it might
lead to her defeat but that she did the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, more than a dozen Statehouse primary races were
expected to turn almost exclusively on a legislator's vote for or
against civil unions. Most of those races involved GOP incumbents
who backed the law.
</P>
<P>
   Signs imploring voters to ''Take Back Vermont'' by ousting those
who voted for civil unions have dotted the Vermont landscape.

<HEADLINE> Report: 140 Unionists Vanished  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- At least half of the 140-plus union members who
disappeared or were killed last year came from Colombia, making it
the world's most dangerous place for organized labor, a labor group
said in a report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In its annual survey of violations of union rights, the
International Confederation of Free Trade Unions found that 676
death threats were issued against Colombian unionists last year. At
least 69 union members were killed, down from 91 the previous year,
and 22 were kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
   In the report, ICFTU general secretary Bill Jordan cited
''ruthless repression in Latin America, attacks and interference in
Asia, arrests and imprisonment in Africa, severe restrictions and
nonpayment of wages in Eastern Europe and a growing trend to
union-busting activities in industrialized countries.''
</P>
<P>
   The 189-page report said 90 unionists died in Latin America last
year. The continent also accounted for some 70 percent of the 3,000
people arrested for carrying out union activities worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,500 unionists worldwide were injured, beaten or
tortured, while at least 5,800 were harassed because of
''legitimate trade union activities,'' the report said. It added
that 12,000 people were unfairly dismissed or refused reinstatement
because they were active union members.
</P>
<P>
   The survey said 37 unionists died during strikes in Asia and the
Pacific, and authorities around the region ''frequently intervened
in trade union affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   It also found high levels of government interference in Eastern
Europe. Across the continent, seven unionists were killed, four of
them in Russia, it said.
</P>
<P>
   The ICFTU says it has affiliates in 145 countries representing
more than 123 million workers.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Weightlifter Sent Home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Taiwan, already hurt by two drug cases,
sent weightlifter Chen Po-pu home after a positive doping test.
</P>
<P>
   ''His entry has been withdrawn,'' Taiwan's Olympic delegation
said in a statement Wednesday (Tuesday night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   Chuang Tsun-che, chief of Taiwan's Olympic delegation, said he
received formal notice from the International Weightlifting
Federation that Chen had tested positive for ''prohibited drugs''
on Tuesday, Taiwan's Central News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Chuang immediately took Chen's athlete identification papers and
arranged for his flight back to Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   Chen was tested twice on Aug. 28 and failed the first test.
After he learned that he had tested positive the first time, Chen
waived his right to know the results of the second test, the agency
reported.

<HEADLINE> Rangers Beat Orioles 6-5  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Kenny Rogers pitched seven strong
innings for his first win in seven starts as the Texas Rangers
completed a doubleheader sweep of the Baltimore Orioles with a 6-5
victory on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers (12-13) allowed three runs and seven hits in his first
win since Aug. 8, helping the Rangers to a sweep of their only
doubleheader of the season. Rogers struck out six and walked one
before allowing hits to the first two batters in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   John Wetteland earned his 33rd save, despite allowing a two-run
double to Greg Myers in the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Texas also took both ends of its last doubleheader on Sept. 6,
1999 over the Chicago White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore was last swept on June 8, 1999 by the Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Helling pitched three-hit ball for eight innings in the
Rangers' 9-1 opening-game victory.
</P>
<P>
   Helling (15-11) gave up Brady Anderson's homer leading off the
game and just two singles after that, winning for the first time in
six starts since beating Boston on Aug. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Helling struck out five and walked none. In his previous five
starts, he had a 9.12 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the Orioles' rookie starters, John Parrish and Jay
Spurgeon, were able to get past the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Rangers' veteran starters shut down the Orioles
lineups, dominated by young players.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson went 4-for-7 in the doubleheader with a homer and two
doubles.
</P>
<P>
   Spurgeon (1-1) was hurt by five walks and two homers, lasting
four innings plus three batters in the fifth. Spurgeon allowed six
runs and four hits and struck out one.
</P>
<P>
   In the second game, Texas grabbed a 4-0 lead in the first inning
on Ricky Ledee's RBI single and rookie Pedro Valdes's three-run
homer, the first of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore closed to 4-2 on Delino DeShields' two-run single in
the third. Ledee's RBI single in the third and Luis Alicea's
leadoff homer in the fifth extended Texas' lead to 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   DeShields' sacrifice fly in the eighth narrowed the deficit to
6-3.
</P>
<P>
   In the opener, Scarborough Green had the first three-hit game of
his career, and Bill Haselman went 3-for-4 with a homer and two
doubles.
</P>
<P>
   Parrish (2-4) was tagged for five runs and six hits in 1 2-3
innings. He has a 22.22 ERA in his last three starts.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson hit Helling's second pitch into the right-field seats
for his 17th homer. Helling didn't give up another hit until Greg
Myers led off the seventh with a single. Anderson added a two-out
single in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Haselman will have surgery on Monday to repair a partial
tear of his right rotator cuff. Haselman has had the problem for
several years and team doctors decide to have the surgery in order
for him to be ready for spring training. Haselman will continue to
play through the weekend. ... The Orioles had split their first
three doubleheaders this season. ... Texas has won seven of 10. ...
Anderson has led off games with home runs 42 times. ... Parrish was
making his first start since being recalled from Triple-A Rochester
on Sept. 5. He had the shortest outing of his eight big league
starts. ... Orioles DH Jeff Conine left in the fourth inning of the
first game after mildly spraining his left ankle while running out
a popup in the first. ... Ruben Sierra, called up from Triple-A
Oklahoma on Sept. 5, went 0-for-5 in his first home start for the
Rangers since Aug. 29, 1992.

<HEADLINE> Forbes in Dead Heat With Librarian  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Rep. Michael Forbes, a three-term incumbent who
switched to the Democrats last year, found himself in a virtual tie
Tuesday with a 71-year-old librarian.
</P>
<P>
   Regina Seltzer, who raised $40,000 to Forbes' $1.4 million, was
ahead by 39 votes of the 11,611 cast in unofficial returns. Forbes
said voting machines had been impounded for a recount that would
take several days.
</P>
<P>
   ''If my opponent is truly several dozen votes ahead, we're going
to support her and live by the will of the people,'' he said from
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety minutes after the polls closed, Seltzer, who fought the
state Democratic Party's support of Forbes, crowed: ''At this point
I'm declaring victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Only two other incumbents have lost in primary elections this
year: Democrat Rep. Marty Martinez of California and GOP Rep.
Merrill Cook of Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes switched parties last year after being wooed by Democrats
trying to reclaim House control. He was personally welcomed into
the party by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Seltzer said that with Forbes' opposition to abortion and votes
to impeach Clinton, he is no Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans couldn't wait until the fall. Their candidate, Felix
Grucci, was unopposed. The GOP sent mailings to Democrats gleefully
touting Forbes' 100 percent rating from the Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mike Forbes is a goner,'' said Jim Wilkinson of the National
Republican Congressional Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Seltzer said her showing proved that local Democrats were not
happy about having a one-time Republican foisted on them.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can only conclude one thing: The people of Long Island, of
the first Congressional District, don't want to be told by
Washington, D.C., who is going to represent them,'' said Seltzer.
</P>
<P>
   Seltzer, a former school librarian, served on the Brookhaven
Town Council two decades ago and went to law school at age 50.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Adam Kennedy drove in three runs and
Benji Gil had two RBIs, including a suicide squeeze bunt, as the
Anaheim Angels beat the Tampa Bay Devil Rays 5-2 on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Belcher (4-2) sent the Devil Rays to their fourth straight
loss, allowing two runs and five hits in seven innings. The
right-hander, making his sixth start since returning from the
60-day disabled list on Sept. 7, struck out one and walked one.
Belcher has missed most of his 14th major league season because of
elbow problems.
</P>
<P>
   Shigetoshi Hasegawa pitched a perfect eighth and Troy Percival
walked one in the ninth for his 29th save in 38 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Garret Anderson ignited the winning rally in the seventh with a
leadoff single against starter Bryan Rekar (6-10). One out later,
Bengie Molina singled for one of his three hits, and Kennedy drove
a 1-0 pitch past center fielder Gerald Williams for a two-run
triple and 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy scored two pitches later as Rekar fielded Gil's
sacrifice bunt and threw him out. Three straight walks, including
two by Doug Creek, loaded the bases before Tony Fiore came in and
struck out Tim Salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy drove in the final run with an RBI single in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   After being held to only one run over their previous three games
at Oakland, the Devil Rays grabbed a 2-0 lead in the second. Greg
Vaughn, who entered the game with a season-low .254 average,
followed a leadoff single by Fred McGriff with his 27th home run.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first by the Devil Rays since Vaughn's homer last
Friday night at Oakland, and only their sixth in 16 games. The
Angels have allowed 212 home runs, tying the Chicago Cubs for
second-most allowed in the majors behind Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Rekar was charged with four runs and five hits in 6 2-3 innings,
striking out five and walking three. The right-hander held Anaheim
hitless until Troy Glaus and Molina opened the fifth inning with
singles. Glaus advanced to third on Kennedy's fly to right and
scored on Gil's squibber to McGriff at first base.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Angels announced that manager Mike Scioscia's entire
coaching staff has been retained for 2001. ... The Devil Rays, who
did not draw a single walk in their four-game series at Oakland,
finally ended their drought when Belcher lost McGriff on a 3-1
count with two outs in the sixth. It ended a streak of 168
consecutive at-bats by Tampa Bay without a base on balls since
McGriff's one-out walk in the fifth inning last Thursday night at
Cleveland. ... McGriff, whose RBI drought reached 14 games, is six
shy of his fifth career 100-RBI season. ... Mo Vaughn struck out in
the first inning to raise his season total to 161, second-most in
the majors and five more than the previous Angels club record set
by Reggie Jackson in 1982. Vaughn, Glaus (142) and Salmon (129)
have combined to strike out 432 times, more than half the total of
six other major league teams. ... Greg Vaughn is three homers away
from joining McGriff and Jose Canseco as the only players in major
league history to hit at least 30 homers in a season with four
different teams.

<HEADLINE> Former librarian in dead heat with Michael Forbes  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELLPORT, N.Y. (AP) - Michael Forbes, the Long Island
congressman who switched parties 14 months ago, faced the prospect
of banishment from the November ballot after a little-known
challenger ran a dead-heat against him in a Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is about the people of this community who have said in no
uncertain terms to Mr. Forbes, 'You're fired.' It's a really,
really amazing thing,'' said Regina Seltzer, a 71-year-old former
librarian who resented the former Republican running as a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am so proud of the people of this community for having the
courage to get up there and to buck the Washington bureaucrats,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   With 100 percent of the vote counted in unofficial returns,
Regina Seltzer was ahead 5,825 to 5,786 over Forbes. She had raised
just $40,000 for her campaign while her opponent had a budget of
$1.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   The eastern Long Island district includes the Hamptons,
playground for the rich and famous, as well as working class
suburban communities in central Suffolk County.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point I'm declaring victory,'' Seltzer said in a
telephone interview on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mike Forbes is a goner,'' added Jim Wilkinson, spokesman for
the National Republican Congressional Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said voting machines had been impounded for a recount
that would take several days.
</P>
<P>
   ''If my opponent is truly several dozen votes ahead, we're going
to support her and live by the will of the people,'' said Forbes,
who switched parties in July 1999 after being wooed by Democrats
trying to reclaim the House majority.
</P>
<P>
   He was personally welcomed into the Democratic Party by
President Clinton, but he voted for impeachment and opposes
abortion. Clinton attended a Manhattan fund-raiser to benefit
Forbes last April.
</P>
<P>
   Mailings from the Republican Party to registered Democrats in
his district gleefully touted his 100 percent rating from the
Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Seltzer entered the race after other local Democrats backed out
under pressure from party leaders in Washington. Seltzer said her
showing proved that local Democrats were not happy about having a
one-time Republican foisted on them.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can only conclude one thing: The people of Long Island, of
the first Congressional District, don't want to be told by
Washington, D.C., who is going to represent them,'' said Seltzer.
''They want a Democrat who represents them to be really and truly a
Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   Seltzer, a former school librarian, served on the Brookhaven
Town Council two decades ago and went to law school at age 50.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I don't think this is about me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Seltzer also got a boost when Newsday endorsed her two weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   As an attorney, she now mostly works free of charge for groups
like the Long Island Pine Barrens Society. And she put her law
degree to good use recently, suing the state Democratic Party to
stop them from running ads on Forbes' behalf before the primary had
been held determining who the party's candidate is. She won.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of Tuesday's Democratic primary will face Republican
Felix Grucci in the November general election. Grucci, the
Brookhaven town supervisor and head of the famed fireworks family,
won an Independence Party primary Tuesday night over Jack Fisher.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Cops Hunt Jungle Labs  </HEADLINE>
By MARGARITA MARTINEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUMACO, Colombia (AP) -- Arriving aboard a U.S.-made combat
helicopter, the head of Colombia's national police and the top U.S.
drug official in the country watched as heavily armed officers
torched a drug lab and dumped coca leaves into a river.
</P>
<P>
   Other helicopters swept back and forth overhead, keeping an eye
out for gunmen, and police stood guard over four people they caught
at the site -- allegedly workers at the drug lab.
</P>
<P>
   The daylong operation Tuesday underscored Washington's deepening
involvement in the drug war in this South American nation. The
offensive is to get fully under way when 60 additional combat
helicopters arrive from the United States next year and U.S.
special forces troops finish training two Colombian army
battalions.
</P>
<P>
   About 75 rifle-toting Colombian police officers swept through a
section of jungle in southwest Colombia on Tuesday as part of
''Operation Mangrove.'' Police say 26 drug labs and 12,500 acres of
cocaine-producing crops have been destroyed by aerial fumigation in
the monthlong regional operation.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, 91,400 acres have been sprayed this year, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're fumigating all over the country, so the drug traffickers
know there is no safe place for them,'' national police chief Gen.
Luis Gilibert told journalists during Tuesday's mission.
</P>
<P>
   Gilibert and Leo Arreguin, chief of the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration in Colombia, watched as a plane swooped down and
dumped a load of herbicide on a coca plantation.
</P>
<P>
   Three combat Black Hawk helicopters flew overhead, ready to fire
back at rebels who have been protecting drug crops and earning
millions of dollars a week by taxing drug producers. There was no
resistance to the raid, which was observed by about 30 journalists
flown in from the capital, Bogota, 370 miles to the northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Later, anti-narcotics police clad in combat fatigues found three
bags bulging with coca leaf, from which cocaine is made, in a
canoe. They dumped the contents into a river.
</P>
<P>
   The officers then torched a rudimentary coca-processing lab and
arrested three boys and a man who allegedly had picked the coca
crop and worked in the lab.
</P>
<P>
   The joint U.S.-Colombian effort, being financed by $1.3 billion
from Washington, is expected to level off coca production by the
end of 2001 and bring a ''dramatic reduction'' a year later, the
State Department said last week.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, the early operations have barely dented overall
drug production in Colombia, which supplies more than 80 percent of
the world's cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   According to the DEA, there were almost 300,000 acres of coca in
Colombia at the end of last year. Evidence suggests there will be
an increase this year over the estimated 520 metric tons of cocaine
that Colombia produced in 1999, Barry McCaffrey, director of the
White House drug control office, said last week.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-drug effort has won support in Washington, but local
coca farmers often feel abandoned by Colombia's government and say
the crop is the only one from which they can turn a profit. Many
locals also fear the widespread fumigation will cause irreversible
ecological damage.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department says the herbicide, called glyphosate,
is only being sprayed on illicit drug crops and that it causes no
long-lasting damage.
</P>
<P>
   But a DEA agent said drug producers often replant the hardy coca
bushes in the same area after the herbicide washes away. Half the
sprayed areas are replanted with coca, said the agent, who did not
want to give his name.

<HEADLINE> Messages Worry Anti-Terror Experts  </HEADLINE>
By THOMAS WAGNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   Terrorists holding civilians hostage in the Philippines are paid
millions of dollars to free them. Their little-known cause is
trumpeted around the world.
</P>
<P>
   They ridicule the president of the Philippines and win new
support for their insurgency. Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi,
who has a history of supporting terrorism, seeks to cast himself in
a humanitarian light by paying the ransom.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the separatist Muslim rebel group Abu Sayyaf has freed
10 of its foreign captives, a consensus appears to be building
among experts on terrorism that the governments involved have
broken some generally accepted rules about dealing with terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ''A million bucks per hostage is a great way to fund your
revolution,'' said William Anthony Donohue, a professor at Michigan
State University who has analyzed the handling of other hostage
crises. ''If the profit is high and the risk is low, and you're a
terrorist group with nothing to lose, why wouldn't you try the same
thing again?''
</P>
<P>
   Ariel Merari, former head of Israel's hostage negotiation unit,
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Experience shows that whenever you pay ransoms, you increase
the likelihood of other kidnappings. In most cases, authorities
have to negotiate with the captors. But that doesn't mean that you
show a willingness to submit to their demands,'' said Merari, who
now works as an expert on international terrorism at Tel Aviv
University.
</P>
<P>
   In a development that seemed to support this view, the Abu
Sayyaf rebels kidnapped three more foreigners in Malaysia on Sunday
night. That raised their total remaining number to 19, including
American Jeffrey Schilling.
</P>
<P>
   The new kidnapping came right on the heels of the most recent
hostage release: On Saturday, following long negotiations with
Libyan envoy Rajab Azzarouq, the rebels freed four Europeans it had
held hostage for months in a southern Philippine jungle. The two
Finns, a Frenchman and a German had been kidnapped April 23 from a
Malaysian diving resort. Libya paid the rebels $4 million in
ransom, negotiators said.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Libya reportedly paid $6 million for the release of
six other foreign hostages: two South Africans, three Frenchwomen
and a German man. Libya said the money was for ''development
projects.'' The U.S. government and others saw it as a ransom.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Malaysian officials and businessmen paid $5 million for
the release of nine Malaysians kidnapped along with the Westerners,
negotiators said.
</P>
<P>
   Philippine President Joseph Estrada has faced calls in the
Philippine Congress to attack the rebels. But in May, European
Union envoy Javier Solana rushed to Manila to plead with Estrada's
government to do nothing that would endanger the hostages' lives.
That effectively closed the option of using force.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Sayyaf is an umbrella group of several armed gangs that
profess to be fighting for an independent Muslim state in the south
of the mostly Roman Catholic Philippines. But they are mainly
involved in kidnap for ransom. On Monday, one of the freed
hostages, Risto Vahanen of Finland, said the rebels raped some of
their female captives.
</P>
<P>
   Terrorism experts interviewed in the United States, Israel,
France and Britain echoed each other's views on the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   They criticized the European Union for publicly pressuring the
Philippine military to avoid violence. They said reporters
shouldn't have been given free rein to visit the rebels and
publicize their demands.
</P>
<P>
   The experts also tended to criticize Manila for allowing Libya
to play a self-serving role and reward the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Gadhafi had the 10 freed foreign hostages flown to Tripoli for
elaborate televised ceremonies during which they warmly thanked
Libya for its help. The deals appeared to be part of Gadhafi's
effort to improve his public image and distract the world's
attention from the trial in the Netherlands of two Libyans accused
in the 1988 terrorist attack on Pan Am Flight 103, which killed 270
people.
</P>
<P>
   ''In most hostage crises, authorities have to talk to the
captors, to open an avenue of communication with them,'' Israel's
Merari said.
</P>
<P>
   ''But that doesn't mean showing a willingness to submit to their
demands,'' he said. ''In fact, when you negotiate without the
threat of punishing the hostage-takers -- if your preclude a
military rescue -- then you negotiate from an obvious point of
weakness, and the result is pretty clear from the start.''
</P>
<P>
   Xavier Raufer, head of the Institute of Criminology at the
University of Paris II in France, said the dense jungles and tribal
structure of the region where Abu Sayyaf operates would make it
hard to use force to free the hostages safely. Raufer also said
that even countries that oppose paying ransoms sometimes do so in
secret, or trade jailed prisoners for hostages.
</P>
<P>
   But he, too, faulted the Europeans for opposing the use of
force, and Libya for making clear how much money it would pay.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you go on TV and show potential hostage-takers around the
world that you are paying million of dollars per hostage, that
makes it riskier for other tourists,'' Raufer said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Wilkinson, director of the Center for the Study of
Terrorism and Political Violence at the University of St. Andrew in
Scotland, said an increase in hostage-taking and kidnapping for
ransom, including U.N. peacekeepers in West Africa, is evident
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is clear,'' he said, ''that European Union countries do not
have a firm, clear policy on how to deal with these situations, and
they have tended to improvise. In the Philippines, they enabled the
release of hostages at an enormous price that increased the
resources to one of the most dangerous and active terrorist groups
in the Pacific region.''

<HEADLINE> Program Aids Former Child Soldiers  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID FOSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- At age 10, when most children learn
math and spelling, Grace Karisio was taught how to kill.
</P>
<P>
   Trained as a child soldier at a rebel army camp in Africa's
war-torn Sudan, Grace watched one day as the rebel commanders
punished a young friend of hers. She didn't know what the boy had
done wrong, but the commanders were angry, and that always meant
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   They tied the boy's hands behind his back and beat him
unconscious. Then they propped him up in a chair and turned to
Grace.
</P>
<P>
   Shoot him, they said. If you miss, you will replace him in the
chair. So Grace stood 20 feet away, took careful aim and squeezed
the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   She did not miss.
</P>
<P>
   When the fighting in a war zone stops, how do you mold former
child soldiers like Grace -- schooled only in violence -- into
productive members of society?
</P>
<P>
   It's one of the thorniest problems highlighted this week in
Winnipeg by an international conference on war and children. The
United Nations estimates that 300,000 children under 18 serve as
soldiers, laborers or sex slaves in armed conflicts around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Since May, more than 50 nations have signed a U.N. agreement
banning soldiers under age 18 in armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
   But signing a proclamation is simpler than helping former child
soldiers reintegrate into the community. Their families may be dead
or scattered. They have little education or ability to earn a
living. Neighbors fear them, or hate them for what they did while
carrying guns. They often are aggressive, violent. Many of the boys
are injured; many of the girls are pregnant from repeated rapes.
</P>
<P>
   Some are emotionally crippled by guilt over the killings, rapes,
lootings and beatings they participated in. Others -- and these
present the bigger challenge -- feel no remorse at all.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their concept of right and wrong is not the same as for
children brought up in a normal setting,'' said Roisin De Burca, a
UNICEF worker who helps rehabilitate child soldiers in Sierra
Leone. ''For some of these children, killing is normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is hope, De Burca says.
</P>
<P>
   Education of returning children is key. So is finding their
families, often a laborious process. Aid workers also try to
shoehorn reconciliation into a local cultural context -- from group
counseling in Kosovo to a tribal spirit-cleansing ceremony in
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, UNICEF and World Vision have put 2,000 youths
through a lengthy reintegration program in Sierra Leone, where a
brutal, nearly decade-long civil war has left the poor west African
country in shambles.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the child soldiers spend three months in a
rehabilitation center before being released to relatives, foster
parents, group homes, or independent living quarters.
</P>
<P>
   In the centers, aid workers divide the youths to break up the
command structure of their old fighting units. The first month,
called ''mad month,'' is dominated by fighting and behavior
problems. By the second month, once they've settled into a routine,
the children start honing learning skills for their return to
school.
</P>
<P>
   De Burca told of one aggressive, violent boy who came to a
rehabilitation center in the Sierra Leone capital of Freetown at
17, after seven years as a soldier. A turning point for the
teen-ager, De Burca said, was his first glimmer of empathy.
</P>
<P>
   When he realized that others had suffered even more from the war
than he had, De Burca said, the boy began to appreciate why people
would be bitter toward him as a former soldier.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to become a taxi driver, so the program helped him
practice for the driving test, bought him an old car and helped him
fix it up.
</P>
<P>
   ''He found a little house. He was in love with a girl. Now he's
18, driving his taxi around Freetown, doing very well,'' De Burca
said.
</P>
<P>
   Grace Karisio, now 18, had to find her own path to peace.
</P>
<P>
   Abducted and taken to a rebel training camp in southern Sudan in
1991 at age 9, she had already been separated from her parents
during a bombing raid.
</P>
<P>
   After five months in the rebel camp, where she learned to take
apart guns and put them back together, she escaped and spent the
next several years drifting from one refugee camp to another.
</P>
<P>
   Nightmares haunted her. She would see the blood of her friend
spurt out, or remember how the rebels killed her brother in front
of her.
</P>
<P>
   At age 16, in Kenya, she found Sister Lucy, a Roman Catholic nun
who befriended her and helped her attend high school. With the
sister's guidance, Grace discovered solace in the thought that she
had no choice but to shoot her friend.
</P>
<P>
   ''You do what you have to do to survive,'' Grace said.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Grace emigrated to Canada, where she now lives by
herself in an apartment in Winnipeg. She still wonders about her
parents. But she has a job and is attending high school.
</P>
<P>
   She is a youth delegate to this week's conference and hopes it
will make a difference for children back in Sudan and other
war-scarred nations.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, she suggests a vital step for helping any child
of war.
</P>
<P>
   ''They need somebody to support them, to let them know that what
happened is not their fault,'' Grace said. ''They need somebody to
give them love.''

<HEADLINE> Water Worries Plague Rio Grande  </HEADLINE>
By MEGAN K. STACK
<TEXT>
<P>
   McALLEN, Texas (AP) -- When the retired engineer at the back of
the room fired off his question, the room fell quiet for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   ''What good is a water right if there's no water?'' Ralph
Niehaus asked. ''You can't irrigate with a piece of paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Heads bobbed in agreement throughout the city chambers, where
farmers and families gathered last week to discuss a drafted plan
that would dictate Rio Grande Valley water use for the next half
century. ''Amen,'' muttered a gray-haired man.
</P>
<P>
   ''Well, irrigators do have shortages,'' agreed Mike Personett, a
water consultant with the regional water planning group. ''Those
shortages can get better over time, but they're not going to go
away.''
</P>
<P>
   That realization is sinking in as these border communities hash
out a water usage plan for the next 50 years. Eight counties
between Eagle Pass and Brownsville must present a proposal to the
state by late September. All 16 Texas water regions are drawing up
similar plans.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, a draft of the South Texas plan is up for public
comment at meetings along the northern bank of the Rio Grande.
Hearings are scheduled Wednesday in Brownsville and Thursday in
Harlingen.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearings, one thing was clear: These are sobering times
for South Texas farmers. Rio Grande irrigation will have to be
revamped -- and even drastic changes might not be enough to keep
farms afloat.
</P>
<P>
   ''The situation is getting worse and worse for the producer,''
said Rod Santa Ana, spokesman for the Texas A&AMP;M Agricultural
Research and Extension Service in Weslaco. ''And this is still a
huge agricultural area -- agriculture is what settled the Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   When water runs low, irrigators are the first to feel a pinch.
Farms occupy a relatively lowly seat in the complicated realm of
water rights. Water goes to the fields only after cities, industry
and steam electric plants are satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ''Irrigators are the residual users,'' said Personett. ''They
get what's left over. Industry and municipal get an ironclad
right.''
</P>
<P>
   By 2050, population and water projections show the Rio Grande
Valley will have just half the water it will need.
</P>
<P>
   The planning group is urging farmers to line dirt canals with
cement, and bury open piping underground to reduce spills and
seepage. Water districts may end up metering flows more thoroughly,
or raising the price of water to encourage conservation.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in irrigation can help stretch water's worth -- but can't
guarantee enough water for all Valley farmers. The water shortage
is fueled by two uncontrollable forces: Severe drought and foreign
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, Mexico has fallen deep into water debt. The nation
now owes U.S. farmers and cities about 1.4 million acre-feet of
water.
</P>
<P>
   The water debt is a burr in United States-Mexico relations --
South Texas representatives say they are no longer invited to
Mexico's meetings, and no change is in sight.

<HEADLINE> S.Korean Port Remembers War Landing  </HEADLINE>
By SANG-HUN CHOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   INCHON, South Korea (AP) -- To figure out who, ultimately, won
the Korean War, gaze out from Inchon onto the mud flats of the
Yellow Sea, where a $5 billion airport is going up on reclaimed
land.
</P>
<P>
   While communist North Korea struggles to feed its people, its
southern rival is moving its economy full speed ahead -- and nowhere
more strikingly than around Inchon, the port city where American
and South Korean troop landings changed the course of the Korean
War.
</P>
<P>
   As for the future, the fact that a celebratory re-enactment of
the landings was recently canceled is one of many signals that the
hatreds that have divided the Korean peninsula for 50 years may
finally be nearing an end.
</P>
<P>
   Friday is the 50th anniversary of the Inchon landings which,
after D-Day at Normandy, were the greatest and perhaps riskiest
amphibious assault in history. The invading communist north was
routed, and Gen. Douglas MacArthur, the American mastermind of the
United Nations-led operation, became a hero.
</P>
<P>
   Today, mammoth freighters ply the ''Flying Fish Channel'' where
U.S. warships had to navigate, with only a six-hour window for a
successful landing in the notoriously tricky tides of South Korea's
western coast. Giant spider-like wharf cranes dominate the
landscape of what used to be the mud flats and seawalls U.S.
Marines had to climb.
</P>
<P>
   But to the people of Inchon, the memory has not faded.
</P>
<P>
   ''History is alive. We know that what American and U.N. troops
did here saved our country,'' said Chung Sang-wan, 41, one of
dozens of people strolling on the hilltop Freedom Park, which
overlooks the now peaceful channel.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of U.S. and South Korean veterans and relatives will
gather here Thursday and Friday for ceremonies beginning with a
remembrance of the six ''Sitting Ducks.''
</P>
<P>
   These were destroyers that sailed up the narrow channel to test
North Korean defenses and trade shell fire. Two days later, an
American-led U.N. naval fleet with bigger guns crept up the
channel. At dawn on Sept. 15, 1950, shells slammed the shore and
U.S. and British planes swarmed over Inchon, knocking out the enemy
fire before 1st Division U.S. Marines overran Wolmi Island and
pressed on to Inchon.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-foot tides, hidden guns and seawalls, and the danger of
landing in an exposed harbor, made the operation seem suicidal. But
that also meant Inchon's beaches would be lightly defended. ''Hit
them where they ain't,'' was MacArthur's dictum, and he triumphed.
</P>
<P>
   About 13,000 Marines poured off flat-bottomed landing craft and
went ashore that day, at a cost of 21 dead and 153 wounded. The
communists' sweeping advance in the first weeks of the war was soon
reversed. Seoul, the capital, 25 miles inland, fell within 12 days,
and the allied forces pinned down on the southern tip of the Korean
peninsula were relieved.
</P>
<P>
   Graying Inchon veterans such as Kim Nak-hyun, 70, still revere
MacArthur and proudly carry ''MacArthur sunglasses'' on their
belts.
</P>
<P>
   The general later was fired after clashing with President Harry
S. Truman. MacArthur saw no substitute for total victory in Korea,
even if that meant full-scale war with China. Truman feared
hostilities might escalate into World War III.
</P>
<P>
   MacArthur came home a hero, and delivered his memorable farewell
line: ''Old soldiers never die; they just fade away.''
</P>
<P>
   ''For us, he never faded away,'' said Hur Young-chul, another
70-year-old veteran.
</P>
<P>
   After their successes at Inchon the allies suffered severe
reverses when Chinese troops entered the war. The fighting became
stalemated and ended in a truce signed July 27, 1953.
</P>
<P>
   At Freedom Park, a 20-foot bronze statue built with citizens'
donations shows MacArthur gazing seaward. Frolicking kindergartners
chased pigeons near the inscription that in part said:
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a deed and this is a man to hold eternally in honored
memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Veterans will remember the dead by setting flowers adrift on the
channel and near the ''Blue Beach,'' one of the three stormed by
allied forces.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the leaders of North and South Korea have met for the
first time, a tentative reconciliation has begun. On Monday, a
North Korean emissary arrived bearing gifts of mushrooms, amid
speculation he is scouting out sites for a historic visit by North
Korean leader Kim Jong Il.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, the Inchon landings were to have been re-enacted for
the 50th anniversary of the outbreak of the war. But in the new
spirit of detente, the Seoul government canceled the event.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in their ramshackle office decorated with pictures of
the landing and slogans such as ''Old soldiers are still alive,''
the Korean veterans lamented the cancellation of the re-enactment.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are all old,'' Kim said, ''and this would have been our
last chance to march in our proud uniform and let young generations
know that only a strong military guarantees peace.''

<HEADLINE> Vt. Lawmakers Ousted Over Gay Law  </HEADLINE>
By ROSS SNEYD
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- Vermont's civil unions law claimed its
victims Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Five Republican state legislators who supported the law granting
gay couples many of the rights and benefits of marriage were
defeated in their primaries. And one Democrat who opposed the law
was also ousted.
</P>
<P>
   Four Republicans and one Democrat who backed the law and were
targeted for defeat because of it survived.
</P>
<P>
   Among lawmakers who were challenged because of their opposition
to the law, one was defeated and another was re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   The primaries represented the first opportunity voters have had
to register their views since the Legislature earlier this year
enacted the closest thing in America to gay marriage. The results
Tuesday reflected the deep split in Vermont over the law.
</P>
<P>
   One of the chief authors of the bill, House Judiciary Committee
chairman Thomas Little, a Republican, beat back a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Granting marriage benefits to gay couples ''is probably
something that's going to take a generation to resolve,'' Little
said.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the biggest casualties among the law's supporters were
Marion Milne, who represents six conservative towns, and John
Edwards, who serves on the Judiciary Committee and represents a
couple of small towns on the Canadian border. Both had been
targeted by opponents of civil unions.
</P>
<P>
   Milne said that she knew when she cast her vote that it might
lead to her defeat but that she did the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, more than a dozen Statehouse primary races were
expected to turn almost exclusively on a legislator's vote for or
against civil unions. Most of those races involved GOP incumbents
who backed the law.
</P>
<P>
   Signs imploring voters to ''Take Back Vermont'' by ousting those
who voted for civil unions have dotted the Vermont landscape.

<HEADLINE> Garcia, Still 49ers' Starting QB  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Jeff Garcia will remain the San
Francisco 49ers' starting quarterback for at least another week.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Steve Mariucci said Tuesday night that Garcia will start
San Francisco's game at St. Louis on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci considered benching Garcia this week after he led just
one touchdown drive in the first three quarters of the 49ers' 38-22
loss to Carolina on Sunday. San Francisco fell to 0-2 with its
worst loss in a home opener since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ''(Garcia) has given his all for the past year and has earned
his position as the starter,'' Mariucci said. ''We also are pleased
with the play of Rick Mirer, who has shown an ability to run the
offense when given the opportunity, but at this time, we feel that
Jeff is better prepared to start and play well.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, who was 12-of-20 for 181 yards and one interception, was
benched in the fourth quarter with the 49ers down 38-7. Mirer threw
for 126 yards and led San Francisco to two late touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   While Garcia's teammates have been noncommittal about the
quarterback shuffle, he said the offensive woes were the result of
team-wide execution problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't feel I've played so poorly that it deserves a
switch,'' Garcia said Monday. ''I feel that I've earned that
position, and I don't think there should be a change. ... It
bothers me that the door was left open.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia started 10 games for San Francisco last year -- his first
in the NFL after five seasons in the Canadian Football League --
while Steve Young battled concussions. Mirer, signed as a free
agent in June, is playing for his fifth NFL team in eight seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia's quarterback rating after two games is 89.4 --
seventh-best in the NFC -- and he was victimized by several dropped
passes on Sunday. Still, San Francisco converted just one of six
third-down situations against the Panthers with Garcia in the game.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 5, Dodgers 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- David Dellucci drove in the go-ahead run with a
two-out infield single in the eighth inning, and the Arizona
Diamondbacks beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 5-4 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona remained 4&AMP;frac12; games behind the New York Mets in the wild
card race and 8&AMP;frac12; games behind San Francisco in the NL West.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Hansen tied the score 4-all in the seventh with his seventh
pinch-hit homer of the season, a three-run drive that broke the
previous major league record of six homers, set by Johnny Frederick
with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1932.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Finley was hit on the left hand by Onan Masaoka (1-1)
leading off the eighth. Pinch-runner Matt Mieske advanced to second
on Danny Bautista's sacrifice and to third on Hanley Frias' flyout
to right.
</P>
<P>
   Dellucci followed with a high chopper to shortstop and beat Alex
Cora's throw to first.
</P>
<P>
   Byung-Hyun Kim (6-5) pitched a one-hit eighth and Matt Mantei
finished with a perfect ninth for his 14th save in 16 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Curt Schilling, who had lost four consecutive starts, allowed
four runs and six hits in seven innings. He is just 4-5 since
Arizona acquired him from Philadelphia in July, and 10-11 overall.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers right-hander Luke Prokopec, making his first major
league start, gave up four runs -- just one earned -- and six hits in
4 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros put the Dodgers ahead with a sacrifice fly in the
fourth, but the Diamondbacks took a 2-1 lead in the bottom half on
a run-scoring error by Cora on Kelly Stinnett's grounder and
Schilling's RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona made it 4-1 in the fifth on Luis Gonzalez's RBI double
and a run-scoring error by Jeff Branson at second.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Schilling hasn't won since Aug. 18. The no-decision was his
first since June 21, a span of 15 starts... Sheffield's
fourth-inning double was his third in two nights. ... Prokopec hit
consecutive batters in the first inning. ... Craig Counsell started
in place of Matt Williams at third base for the Diamondbacks even
though Williams has seven hits in his last 15 at-bats. Counsell
went 1-for-2 with a stolen base. ... Tom Goodwin beat out a bunt
single in the sixth to extend his hitting streak to a career-best
13 games.

<HEADLINE> White House Applauds China Action  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The White House applauded China for
withdrawing more than 20 Olympic athletes who failed doping tests,
saying the action signaled that Beijing is truly committed to
cracking down on drug cheats.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Barry McCaffrey, director of the White House drug policy
office, said Wednesday he sent a letter to China's sports minister
congratulating him for the decision to drop 27 athletes and 13
officials from the team for the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a tremendous demonstration of their seriousness of
purpose of acting against doping in their own teams,'' McCaffrey
told The Associated Press shortly after his arrival in Sydney.
''It's a terrific signal that they are committed.''
</P>
<P>
   After a week of saying that injuries, illness and poor
performance were involved in some cases, Chinese officials said
Tuesday that nearly all of the 27 athletes cut from the Olympic
team failed drug tests.
</P>
<P>
   He Huixian, the Chinese Olympic Committee's spokeswoman, said
''the overwhelming majority'' had suspicious results in blood tests
for the performance-enhancing drug EPO.
</P>
<P>
   Among them were six runners trained by famed coach Ma Junren,
whose record-smashing ''Ma's Army'' stunned the world in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese sports have been riddled with drug scandals in recent
years, but none involving so many people in one series of tests. In
addition to the athletes, the Chinese cut 13 coaches including Ma
from their squad.
</P>
<P>
   By leaving home those who failed drug tests, Chinese sports
officials may have improved Beijing's bid for the 2008 Olympics and
avoided a repeat of embarrassing doping scandals at the 1994 Asian
Games and 1998 swimming world championships.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some view these busts as a scandal,'' McCaffrey said. ''In our
view it's exactly the right signal that the Chinese and the
international community mean business.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey, who met with anti-doping officials in Beijing this
year, said he will have more talks with the Chinese during his stay
in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey had been a strident critic of the International
Olympic Committee and its anti-doping policies. But he said
Wednesday that important progress has been made in the past 18
months -- including creation of the World Anti-Doping Agency,
implementation of more than 2,000 unannounced out-of-competition
controls worldwide and approval of a test for the banned
endurance-boosting hormone EPO.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly this is the beginning of a new era,'' McCaffrey said.
''The Sydney Olympics will be the most drug tested games in the
history of sports.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a lot to be proud of,'' he added. ''Having said that,
we are probably a third of where we need to be.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said he will attend meetings of the World Anti-Doping
Agency in Sydney and hold talks with a number of international
officials, including IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch. One of
his priorities is to push for greater independence of WADA, which
is still based in the IOC's home city of Lausanne, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   One of McAffrey's aides, Robert Housman, is among the 15
independent observers designated by WADA to monitor drug-testing
procedures in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no question we will never see again a repeat of what
happened in Los Angeles (1984) and Atlanta (1996), where you had
missing samples, destroyed evidence,'' McCaffrey said. ''I think
those days are over.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said he also will meet with Canadian and Australian
government officials in Oslo, Norway, on Nov. 15-17 to review the
experience of Sydney and work on expanding the anti-doping efforts
for the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has to be a common list of banned substances and
accepted scientific standards,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   IOC members have complained about a study, financed and released
by the White House last week, that criticized the international
committee and other sports organizations for failing to do enough
to combat the use of banned performance-enhancing drugs in the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The report was prepared by Joseph A. Califano Jr., president of
the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia
University.
</P>
<P>
   IOC officials have called the report misguided and out of date.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said he found the IOC response ''curious.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers ''did a superb piece of work,'' he said. ''We
welcome their report. It gives a tremendous insight into the
problems we are facing. It's just really a call to action. ... The
question isn't finger- pointing. We don't need defensiveness.''

<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Freddy Garcia won his third straight start in
September and the Seattle Mariners stayed one game ahead of Oakland
in the AL West with a 11-3 victory over the Kansas City Royals on
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Oliver went 3-for-5 with two doubles and three RBIs for the
Mariners, 7-5 this month after going 11-17 in August.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Martinez, 3-for-5 with three RBIs, hit his 34th homer, a
two-run drive in the eighth off Ricky Bottalico, who also allowed a
two-run homer to Carlos Guillen in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia (7-4), coming off wins at Toronto and Boston, allowed
three runs and seven hits in 7 1-3 innings, including a pair of
solo home runs by Mike Sweeney and another by Johnny Damon. With
133 RBIs, Sweeney tied the Royals record set by Hal McRae in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Reichert (8-6) lost for the first time in 11 starts since
July 16, giving up four runs, nine hits and four walks in five
innings. He had won his previous five decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle, just 10-19 since taking a seven-game division lead on
Aug. 11, plays a four-game series against Oakland at Safeco Field
next week.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney, who had his second two-homer game of the season and the
sixth of his career, put the Royals ahead in first with his first
homer of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle took a 4-1 lead in the second on Oliver's two-run
double, Stan Javier's RBI grounder and Martinez's run-scoring
single.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney hit his 27th homer in the fourth, extending his career
high, and the Royals loaded the bases in the sixth on a walk to
Damon and singles by Rey Sanchez and Sweeney.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia escaped when Jermaine Dye grounded back to the mound for
a 1-2-3 double play and Joe Randa hit an inning-ending groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Javier tripled home a run and scored on John Olerud's single to
make it 6-2 against rookie Kris Wilson in the sixth. Oliver hit an
RBI double in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Damon homered in the eighth off Garcia, giving him a career-high
78 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Sweeney also homered twice April 7 against Minnesota. ...
Seattle's Al Martin left after he was hit by Oliver's grounder to
third in the fifth. ... Seattle LF Rickey Henderson (bruised left
hip) and 2B Mark McLemore (strained left hamstring) didn't start.
... If Seattle and Oakland tie for the division title, a one-game
playoff would be held at Safeco Field, according to a coin flip won
by the Mariners on Tuesday.

went 2-for-3 with a walk and raised his average to .381. He was
1-for-11 in his previous three games.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii (6-14), who missed his last start on Saturday with
soreness in his right arm, allowed two runs and three hits. Yoshii,
who had not pitched since Sept. 3, helped himself at the plate with
two sacrifice bunts.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Clement (12-15) allowed four runs -- two earned -- on eight
hits as he lost his third straight start. Clement struck out six
and walked one.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego made it 4-3 in the eighth inning on pinch-hitter Joe
Vitiello's RBI single off Jose Jiminez, who earned his 20th save.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies added two runs in the ninth on Jiminez's RBI single
and Juan Pierre's run-scoring groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Frye went 4-for-4 and scored three runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies took a 2-1 lead in the third after Frye led off with
a single, was sacrificed to second by Yoshii and went to third on
Nefi Perez's bunt single.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Cirillo followed with an RBI double before an intentional
walk to Helton loaded the bases. Clement then hit Jeffrey Hammonds
with his first pitch to give Colorado a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Petrick reached on Dave Magadan's throwing error to lead off
the Colorado fourth and Frye followed with an infield single.
Yoshii sacrificed the runners and Pierre beat out an infield single
to second base that scored Petrick.
</P>
<P>
   Frye also scored on the play when second baseman Damian
Jackson's throw sailed over the head of first baseman Ryan Klesko.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego closed to within 4-2 when Eric Owens led off the fifth
with a single, stole second and went to third when Petrick's throw
sailed into center field. Owens scored easily as Pierre allowed the
ball to bounce past him to the center-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres took a 1-0 lead on Magadan's RBI single in the first.
Notes: Yoshii is 5-0 in 10 career September starts with an ERA of
2.83. ... Cirillo set a career high with his 47th double. He had 46
doubles in 1996 and 1997 with Milwaukee. ... The Padres stole three
more bases, giving them nine steals in as many attempts in the two
games against Colorado. ... In his previous three starts, Clement
walked 30 batters. Clement leads the majors in walks allowed with
115.

<HEADLINE> Mo. Man Executed for 1998 Slaying  </HEADLINE>
By JIM SALTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   POTOSI, Mo. (AP) -- A convicted killer was executed by injection
early Wednesday for the 1989 slaying of a man following a dispute
over machine guns.
</P>
<P>
   George ''Baby'' Harris, 41, was condemned for shooting to death
Stanley ''Hank'' Willoughby inside a Kansas City crack house.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Harris had won a large amount of money playing
an illegal game of craps on March 11, 1989. Another man at the game
needed money and offered to pawn two machine guns to Harris for
$500.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, concerned the weapons would be stolen from his trunk,
gave them to Willoughby for safekeeping. Willoughby took the guns
to the crack house, where other men hid them in bushes in the back
yard, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   When Harris tried to retrieve the guns, Willoughby told him he
didn't know where they were. Harris believed Willoughby was trying
to steal the weapons, according to testimony at Harris' trial.
</P>
<P>
   The two men later argued inside the house, and Harris shot
Willoughby in the face and throat with a .41-caliber revolver.
Harris fled but was caught by police four days later.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said he shot Willoughby after the man moved toward him
and reached for a gun.
</P>
<P>
   ''This ain't no first-degree murder,'' Harris said in a recent
interview. ''I shot the man in self-defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris was the fourth Missouri inmate put to death this year.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Debate Goers Older, Educated  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Memo to the presidential candidates: More than
half of Americans plan to watch the debates and think they will be
an important factor in how they vote.
</P>
<P>
   A few other things you might want to know? Debate watchers tend
to be age 35 and older, middle-income or higher, at least partially
college educated, registered to vote and a member of one of the two
major political parties, says an Associated Press poll.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think (the debates) are important and I do plan to watch
them,'' said Sarah Brown, a 62-year-old retiree from Steubenville,
Ohio. ''I want to hear what they plan to do on the issues that are
important to me -- education, the economy and Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   More who plan to watch say Democrat Al Gore will do better in
the debates than Republican George W. Bush by 49-29, according to
the poll conducted for the AP by ICR of Media, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign aides for Gore and Bush plan to meet Thursday with the
Commission on Presidential Debates to negotiate a schedule. The
commission has proposed three presidential debates, Oct. 3, 11 and
17, and one vice presidential debate on Oct 5. Six in 10 say that's
the right number to have.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of Democrats say Gore will do better in the debates,
while just over half of Republicans think Bush will do better.
Independents are about evenly split.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, more Americans think Gore will do better, 44 percent,
than Bush, 33 percent. A fifth say they just don't know.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm hoping Bush does better, but with the numbers so close,
it's hard to know,'' said Anne Jones, a 36-year-old housewife and
student from Portsmouth, Va., who considers herself an independent.
''I hope they just stick with the issues, clarify their positions.
I don't care about hearing them argue.''
</P>
<P>
   Marie Samaha, 53, an elementary school principal from
Moltonborough, N.H., said she hasn't been able to figure out who
will fare better.
</P>
<P>
   ''Al Gore has better use of language, but sometimes he doesn't
come across as being totally honest,'' said Samaha, a Democrat.
''George Bush has a folksy way about him and people tend to trust
that kind of dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of 10 Americans say the debates will be very important to
their decision, with almost three of 10 blacks feeling that way.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Williams, a 31-year-old teacher and Republican from
Norwalk, Ohio, said he thinks the debates will make a difference in
the election because the race is close.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are 40 percent of us who support one side and another
approximately 40 percent on the other side,'' he said. ''It's the
20 percent in the middle who determine things. There are a lot of
undecided voters out there, and I think the debates could push it
one way or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   While two-thirds of Democrats say they will watch the debates
and just about as many Republicans, fewer than half of independents
plan to tune in.
</P>
<P>
   Just over half of Americans say they prefer a two-way debate,
while about a third say the Green Party's Ralph Nader and the
Reform Party's Pat Buchanan should be included. Independents are
about equally split between preferring two-way and four-way.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let them all get up there and hack at each other for a
while,'' said Richard Gardner, a 57-year-old independent from
Buckley, Mich., who works at an auto dealership.
</P>
<P>
   Some who already have a preference plan to watch to see if their
candidate measures up.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gore is a pretty nice person, but he seems weak,'' said Edward
Sexton, a retired NASA worker from Athens, Ala., who backs the
Democrat for now. ''I'd like to find out whether he has the stuff
to hold up under the onslaught that presidents face. Look at Bill
Clinton. He's beat up like an old football.''

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton wins primary against Manhattan surgeon  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton, with a taste of victory
from a Democratic U.S. Senate primary win, has set her sights on
the tougher test ahead against Republican Rick Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm grateful for the strong support I have received from my
fellow Democrats in New York,'' the first lady said Tuesday night
in a statement issued by her campaign after she easily swept by Dr.
Mark McMahon. ''Over the next two months, I will continue to work
hard each and every day to earn the opportunity to represent the
people of New York in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   In the primary, Clinton already has made history by becoming the
only first lady ever to win an election.
</P>
<P>
   While her run for the Senate has attracted national attention
since early last year, the primary against the little-known
orthopedic surgeon from Manhattan had gone virtually unnoticed even
in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   With 97 percent of the precincts reporting, Clinton had 529,378
votes, or 82 percent, to McMahon's 119,769 votes, or 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The results meant that fewer than 20 percent of New York's
almost 5 million enrolled Democrats bothered to go to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Lazio, who had no primary, are to face each other in
their first debate Wednesday night in Buffalo. It was to be
televised live from 7 p.m. to 8 p.m. on NBC stations across the
state and nationally by tape delay from 10 p.m. to 11 p.m. on
MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   Much like Lazio, McMahon based his campaign largely on the first
lady's lack of New York roots. The 39-year-old physician also
complained that New York's Democratic bosses were forcing Clinton
on party members.
</P>
<P>
   McMahon said Tuesday night that despite his loss, ''I do feel
like a winner today because this campaign gave the democratic
process back to the people.''
</P>
<P>
   There were also a host of congressional and state legislative
primaries in New York on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   On the eastern tip of Long Island, Republican-turned-Democrat
Rep. Michael Forbes faced a surprisingly strong primary challenge
from 71-year-old Regina Seltzer, a former librarian who went to law
school at age 50. With almost all the votes in, the race remained
too close to call. She said her candidacy had allowed ''Democrats
to vote for a real Democrat, not some phony Washington is trying to
shove down our throats.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Bronx, six-term Rep. Eliot Engel beat back a Democratic
primary challenge from state Sen. Larry Seabrook that had taken on
racial and religious overtones. Seabrook, who is black, accused
Engel, who is white and Jewish, of failing a constituency that is
increasingly minority.
</P>
<P>
   In Brooklyn, Rep. Major Owens survived a Democratic primary
challenge from New York City Councilwoman Una Clarke, his one-time
ally. The race highlighted tensions within the black community
between those who migrated from the South and the area's diverse
new Caribbean immigrants. Owens was born in Memphis, Tenn., Clarke
in Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   Also in Brooklyn, Rep. Edolphus Towns beat lawyer Barry Ford in
a Democratic primary. Towns has been under fire for crossing party
lines in 1997 to endorse Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, unpopular in
heavily minority communities like Towns' district.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City winning a Democratic primary is usually
tantamount to election in November because of a better than 5-1
enrollment edge.

<HEADLINE> Regulators To Probe Media Content  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's shaping up to be a tough week for the
people who produce and distribute movies, video games, pop music
and television shows.
</P>
<P>
   First, a scathing Federal Trade Commission report claimed the
entertainment industry was peddling adult material to underage
audiences. Then federal media regulators announced they would take
a closer look at the amount of sex and violence on the major TV
networks.
</P>
<P>
   Both presidential campaigns latched onto the issue -- one that
resonates strongly with Americans concerned about the exposure of
young adults to sex and violence. Al Gore said he was prepared, if
elected to the White House, to crack down on the industry if it did
not stop marketing violent movies, recordings and video games to
underage youth within six months.
</P>
<P>
   His Republican opponent, George W. Bush, questioned Gore's
credibility on the issue and said the solution should rest with
parents and political persuasion, not new federal regulation.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Gore's running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, a
longtime critic of explicit content in the media, was to confront
entertainment executives at a Senate hearing. Lieberman and Sen.
John McCain, R-Ariz., who was chairing the Senate Commerce
Committee hearing, backed a measure last year that requested the
FTC study on entertainment violence.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans had their own representative at the hearing -- Lynne
Cheney, wife of the Republican vice presidential nominee and former
head of the National Endowment for the Humanities, who said
entertainment violence ''debases and degrades the culture our
children are growing up in.''
</P>
<P>
   The FTC report decried the entertainment industry's ''pervasive
and aggressive marketing'' of adult material -- such as R-rated
movies or video games intended for mature audiences -- to children.
</P>
<P>
   The fallout from the study was felt Tuesday in Hollywood, as the
Walt Disney Co. announced changes in its marketing practices,
including a prohibition against theater owners showing trailers for
R-rated films before movies released under the Walt Disney label.
The Disney-owned ABC network also will not accept advertisements
for R-rated films during prime time before 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Disney said it would not show R-rated films -- released under its
Touchstone, Hollywood Pictures and Miramax Films labels -- to focus
groups under age 17 and would urge theater owners to more strictly
enforce the age restriction. The company does not release R-rated
films under the Walt Disney label.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Valenti, head of the Motion Picture Association of America,
acknowledged it was not suitable to target R-rated films to very
young children, but asserted that the FTC's report was based on
subjective judgments.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the commission determined that R-rated movies were
advertised on TV programs most popular with the under-17 group.
But, Valenti said, for many of these shows, the majority of the
audience is 18 and over.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not dealing with Euclid's geometry where the equations
are pristine and explicit,'' he said in remarks prepared for
delivery at Wednesday's hearing. Still, he promised that the
industry would examine how it advertises and conducts research so
that it does not deliberately target underage viewers.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't stop calls by South Carolina Attorney General
Charlie Condon for state prosecutors to band together in a lawsuit
against Hollywood, akin to the action states took against the
tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission extended the sphere of
scrutiny to the airwaves by announcing Tuesday it would examine
whether broadcasters were promoting inappropriate programming when
children were likely to be watching.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that broadcasters' obligation is not only to
protect children from objectionable programming but also to offer
positive and educational programming for children,'' FCC Chairman
William Kennard said in a letter to lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard scheduled FCC hearings on the content of broadcast TV
for October, after a group of senators, including Lieberman and
McCain, complained about sexual vulgarity and violence on TV
several months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The senators have questioned whether broadcasters, who enjoy
free access to the public airwaves, are providing programming that
benefits the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard joined Lieberman in calling for broadcasters to revive a
voluntary industry programming code to ensure the appropriateness
of programming during times children are likely to be watching.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Broadcasters declined to comment
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Africa Trade To U.S. Increasing  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's been on the agenda of the government's
Africa experts virtually every day for the past two months: How
many of the 50 or so sub-Saharan African countries qualify for
trade benefits under new legislation that will take effect at the
end of the month?
</P>
<P>
   Domestic and cross-border strife afflict many African countries,
and there are even pockets of slavery on the continent. Officials
say the debate over eligibility for the benefits has been feverish.
</P>
<P>
   This past spring, Congress decided to upgrade Africa's status as
an economic partner by approving legislation to give certain
African products duty-free and quota-free access to U.S. markets.
</P>
<P>
   Beforehand, Africa and Antarctica were the only continents where
the United States did not have a trade policy. The great bulk of
Africa's exports to the United States has consisted of oil from
Nigeria and Angola. But with the passage of the Africa Growth and
Opportunity Act, the prospects of wider African sales to American
markets has increased.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the Cold War has enabled the United States to deal
with African countries on their merits, as opposed to how they
stand ideologically.
</P>
<P>
   Trade is one of a number of fronts on which the Clinton
administration has been moving in its Africa policy. It also is
seeking congressional approval of $435 million in debt relief for
Africa's poorest nations. Assistance levels are reaching all-time
highs. And efforts are being made to help Africa deal with its AIDS
crisis, albeit on terms less generous than many African governments
want.
</P>
<P>
   The new law says African countries will be excluded from the
trade benefits if they are considered hostile to U.S. interests,
have a poor human rights record or pursue economic policies deemed
unsound.
</P>
<P>
   The task of administration officials is to decide which
countries will make the cut and which won't. They are reluctant to
talk about individual countries except to confirm that Sudan,
regarded here as having one of the continent's nastiest human
rights records, will not qualify. Two years ago, U.S. cruise
missiles destroyed a pharmaceutical plant believed to be linked to
terrorist operations. Sudan has denied the claim.
</P>
<P>
   Among the surest bets to make the list is Nigeria, a favorite of
Washington these days after a democratic government was installed
in 1999 following years of military dictatorships. President
Clinton visited Nigeria last month to show his support.
</P>
<P>
   Salih Booker, director of the Africa Fund, which advocates
positive U.S. policies toward the continent, says he believes about
30 African countries will qualify for the trade benefits, or about
60 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   Booker is less enthusiastic about the trade bill than is
Clinton, who says the new approach ''reaffirms America's commitment
to open trade and strengthens the partnership between the United
States and our friends in Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation says nations that qualify are entitled to
export, without duties or quotas, apparel made with U.S. yarn and
fabric.
</P>
<P>
   Clothing made from African fabric would be allowed to rise from
1.5 percent of U.S. imports to 3.5 percent over eight years,
boosting African exports of these products from about $250 million
a year now to as much as $4.2 billion, according to estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not generous,'' says Booker, citing an effective lobbying
effort by textile companies and textile unions.
</P>
<P>
   Over the short term, Booker believes the new law will lead to
expanded apparel imports from Kenya, Mauritius, South Africa and
maybe a few others. There may be increases in exports of leather
goods as well, he says.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration contends that the legislation would
result in minimal job loss for U.S. workers and also would open the
way for increased investment in African countries.
</P>
<P>
   The suspense over which countries qualify will end in less than
three weeks when Clinton announces the administration's choices.
</P>
<P>
   Not all countries are eager to be chosen. They prefer not to
embrace U.S. prescriptions for economic reform, including
reductions in public spending, contending this would only leave
their peoples more destitute.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton won New York's Democratic Senate
primary Monday. Clinton had 71,714 votes or 78 percent and orthopedic surgeon
Mark McMahon had 20,481 votes or 22 percent. As nine states and the District of
Columbia held contests on the last big primary day of 2000, the first lady built
a wide lead over McMahon en route to her contest against unopposed Republican
Rep. Rick Lazio in November. With 16 percent of precincts reporting, Clinton had

compares to 2,875 during the first six months of 1999, according to statistics

	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - You may have to pay a little more for
your pumpkin this Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   That's the word from farmers and agriculture experts who say
this summer's wet, cool weather has significantly hurt much of the
upstate pumpkin crop.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pumpkins didn't get planted until very late because it was so
wet this spring. A lot won't make it in time for Halloween,'' said
Bob King, an agricultural expert at Cornell Cooperative Extension.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, pumpkins are likely to be late, more expensive and
maybe a little less orange this season.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Michaloski of Green Acre Fruit Farm in Greece predicts the
20 cents to 25 cents per pound average retail price could climb.
His advice: Buy early.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Herman of Herman's Farm Market and Cider Mill in Webster
planted his pumpkin crop over the Memorial Day weekend. But heavy
rain rotted all the seeds. So he replanted the entire eight acres
in early July.
</P>
<P>
   The unseasonable weather added insult to injury, as pumpkins
need heat and sun to ripen.
</P>
<P>
   These immature pumpkins have the heft but not the hue that makes
them desirable for Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   ''A green pumpkin isn't really marketable - maybe for
Christmas,'' said Herman, who hopes to start harvesting at the end
of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers expect to have pumpkins for sale by the last week of
the month.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers Negotiate Fate of Scientist  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD BENKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- As prosecutors and defense attorneys
negotiated the fate of Wen Ho Lee, the man at the center of the
dispute -- once vilified, now pitied -- waited in solitary
confinement.
</P>
<P>
   A plea deal concerning the nuclear scientist underwent attempts
at revision Tuesday. Prosecutors filed a sealed document relating
to the plea but did not respond to calls for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys also had no comment on negotiations, and
nobody was predicting any outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   A court hearing was scheduled Wednesday to address the proposed
agreement that would drop 58 counts against Lee, leaving one count
and no further prison time.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're optimistic that the plea bargain is going to go through
and that there won't be anything to make it hit a snag,'' Lee's
neighbor, Don Marshall, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall and his wife Jean, who plan a homecoming in Los Alamos,
visited Lee's wife, Sylvia. Marshall said the Lee family, too, was
''cautiously optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee's plea bargain, as envisioned Sunday, was at least partly
based on a trade: Lee would tell prosecutors what they wanted in
exchange for the reduced charges. Then he could walk away a free
man having been sentenced to nine months he has already served in
jail.
</P>
<P>
   It included assurances that Lee had destroyed the seven tapes --
something he has sworn from the outset -- and that he would submit
to questioning under oath, take a polygraph and tell, in detail,
why he made the tapes and what he did with them.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was fired from Los Alamos in March 1999 and nine months
later was charged with downloading restricted nuclear data to
unsecured computers and tapes. He could have faced life in prison
if convicted of all 59 counts.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation began as an offshoot of a fizzled Chinese
espionage case, with government attorneys making dire accusations
that Lee downloaded the ''crown jewels'' of U.S. nuclear science
and might be poised to hand them over to a foreign power.
</P>
<P>
   But the case began disintegrating last month at a renewed bail
hearing. FBI agent Robert Messemer, whose testimony was key in
initially denying Lee bail in December, said he repeatedly erred in
that testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal described Sunday by government sources, Lee also
was expected to drop allegations that he was targeted because he is
Chinese, claims included in a civil lawsuit against the FBI and the
Energy and Justice departments.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Washington-based Judicial Watch said it was suing
Lee and others on behalf of Notra Trulock, a former Energy
Department counterintelligence chief. Lee's lawyers have said
Trulock was among those who unfairly singled Lee out.
</P>
<P>
   Judicial Watch said Trulock, in a defamation complaint, alleges
Lee and others ''scapegoated'' Trulock to divert attention from
security lapses at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Lee's lawyers
declined comment.

<HEADLINE> Blair Vows End to U.K. Fuel Panic  </HEADLINE>
By JILL LAWLESS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Fuel tankers escorted by police began to roll past
protesters' barricades early Wednesday en route to Britain's
fuel-starved gas pumps -- the latest development in Europe-wide fuel
protests that have left pumps running dry and tempers flaring.
</P>
<P>
   The first trucks began departing depots in England and Scotland
hours after Prime Minister Tony Blair held a day of crisis meetings
Tuesday and promised a quick end to the protests.
</P>
<P>
   Truckers, taxi drivers and others angry over high fuel prices
and taxes have blockaded fuel depots for days, creating shortages
that have set off panic buying and kept cars off roads. By Tuesday
evening, retailers Shell and Elf estimated that 90 percent of their
British filling stations were dry.
</P>
<P>
   Queen Elizabeth II and her senior advisers gave the British
government the go-ahead to employ emergency measures, which could
include the use of troops to move fuel to critical points.
</P>
<P>
   Under the measures, the government instructed oil companies to
deliver fuel to hundreds of stations across Britain, said the
Department of Trade and Industry. Some of the tankers on the road
early Wednesday were met by shouts of abuse from demonstrators, but
there were no reports of violence.
</P>
<P>
   While the disruption was worst in Britain, similar protests
choked roadways in other European cities and along the borders of
Belgium and the Netherlands. Smaller protests were also reported in
Germany and even France, whose government made concessions to the
strikers over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''These guys are doing it to save their livelihoods,'' said Mike
Salmon of the British Road Haulage Association. The group
represents truck drivers, farmers and others who claim that the
double whammy of high oil prices and taxes threatens to bankrupt
them.
</P>
<P>
   The protests here started on Sept. 7, with groups of farmers,
taxi drivers, fishermen and even retirees picketing refineries
across Britain. By Tuesday, hospitals canceled non-vital surgery,
ambulance services reported delays and the Royal Post Office warned
that its deliveries were being ''seriously threatened.'' One
municipality in Wales said it was closing all 19 of its secondary
schools because staff were unable to get to work.
</P>
<P>
   The public and the press channeled much of their rage at the
Blair government for not easing gasoline taxes in the face of
rising oil prices, which have soared to $35 a barrel. Taxes account
for 74 percent of the cost of gasoline in Britain, the highest in
Europe -- and far higher than in the United States -- at $4.31 per
gallon.
</P>
<P>
   But some people began to accuse the oil companies of mounting a
''phony war'' by refusing to move their trucks out of the depots,
despite reassurances from demonstrators that their protests were
peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't allow people to be held to ransom by the oil
companies,'' said Bill O'Brien, a lawmaker with the ruling Labor
Party.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Gibson-Smith, managing director of oil giant British
Petroleum Co., rejected the charge.
</P>
<P>
   ''We make money by selling petrol, not by not selling petrol,''
he told the British Broadcasting Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Blair didn't say what steps he would take if supplies didn't
open up, but he was adamant that the government would not cave in.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whatever the strength of the feeling, there can be no excuse
whatever for this type of action, which is hurting our people,
businesses and emergency services severely,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Truck owner Ken Lane, a spokesman for the picketers at the
Hamble refinery, said the protest was far from over.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am prepared to stay here for as long as it takes. I will put
my business in jeopardy if necessary,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Mayor asks for outside help after shootings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UTICA, N.Y. (AP) - To combat a rash of shootings, Mayor Tim
Julian is asking the Oneida County sheriff's department and the
state police for help.
</P>
<P>
   Seven people were injured in four shootings from Friday through
Monday. Two Uticans remained in critical condition and another was
serious Tuesday in the aftermath of the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Julian said he has confidence in the Utica Police Department's
ability to protect the public's safety, but, he said, ''I want to
see if (the other police agencies) have any ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would ask the sheriff's deputies to patrol the train
station, a likely point of entry into the city for drug couriers.
Julian said the state police are already ''an active presence'' in
the city.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're looking at the best possible way to help them integrate
into our operations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the Utica police is doing a good job of combating
crime in the city, Julian replied, ''I think they're doing the best
job they can.''
</P>
<P>
   Julian's decision to ask for outside help followed a Tuesday
meeting in which he met with police officials and Public Safety
Commissioner Cornell Maye to thrash out a strategy to stop the
street violence.

<HEADLINE> GOP Seeks To Override Clinton Veto  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Believing they have a winning political issue
if not the votes, House Republican leaders planned an attempt to
override President Clinton's veto of a tax break for millions of
married couples.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall election campaigns, Republicans will argue that
replacing Clinton in the White House with Republican George W. Bush
-- and keeping the GOP in control on Capitol Hill -- would remove
obstacles to ending the ''marriage penalty'' tax paid by 25 million
two-income couples.
</P>
<P>
   ''Republicans believe that the federal budget surplus must be
returned to the men and women who earned it,'' said House Majority
Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas. ''President Clinton ignored a strong,
bipartisan consensus when he rejected the effort to achieve this
goal through tax relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty-eight Democrats joined 220 Republicans in voting for the
marriage penalty tax cut when it passed the House in July, a dozen
shy of the two-thirds requirement for an override. Even if the
House were to approve the override, there is little chance the
Senate would follow suit. The House was voting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the House fell 14 votes short of those needed to
override Clinton's veto of a bill abolishing estate taxes, another
issue the GOP will highlight in fall election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage penalty bill would cut income taxes by $292 billion
over 10 years for almost all married couples, particularly the 25
million with two incomes who pay more than they would if single.
The legislation would also cut taxes for millions of couples who
now enjoy an income tax bonus, generally those in which one spouse
earns the bulk of household income.
</P>
<P>
   When he vetoed the bill in August, Clinton cited statistics
showing that the marriage penalty bill, combined with other GOP tax
cuts, would give families in the top 1 percent income group an
average tax cut of $16,000, compared to only $220 for those earning
middle incomes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It provides little relief to families that need it most, while
devoting a large fraction of its benefits to families with higher
incomes,'' Clinton said in his veto message.
</P>
<P>
   The president also said marriage penalty relief could be
targeted to middle-class taxpayers at lower cost, preserving more
of the surplus for other needs such as education spending, reducing
federal debt and a Medicare prescription drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   But during a White House meeting with congressional leaders
Tuesday, the president indicated there was still room for tax
relief before Congress adjourns.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got to decide which tax cuts we're for and how much does
that cost this year,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage penalty bill would:
</P>
<P>
   --Gradually expand the bottom 15 percent income tax bracket for
married couples so it is twice the current corresponding bracket
for single taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   --Raise the standard deduction for married couples who do not
itemize so that it's equal to that of two single people.
</P>
<P>
   --Increase the earned income tax credit limit for low-income
families by $2,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   --Extend through 2004 a current exemption from the alternative
minimum tax for married couples who claim personal credits, such as
the $500 per-child tax credit.

<HEADLINE> Disparity in Death Penalties Found  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Death penalty critics are demanding a
moratorium on executions after a Justice Department report showed
racial and geographic disparity in federal death sentences, but
Attorney General Janet Reno wants more studies instead.
</P>
<P>
   The wide variations by race and location found in the report
released Tuesday were not the product of bias in her department,
Reno said, but rather resulted from social ills like poverty, drug
abuse and lack of opportunity that affect minorities more than
whites and produce criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ''The federal criminal justice system is not designed to remedy
these systemic problems by itself,'' Reno told a news conference.
She ordered additional studies of why some murderers get charged
with federal capital crimes, as opposed to being charged by local
police.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point we are troubled by the figures, but we have not
found the bias'' in her department's procedures, Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   And she endorsed legislation proposed by Sen. Patrick Leahy,
D-Vt., that would provide post-conviction DNA genetic tests for
federal and state inmates.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said the data raised questions ''since we're
supposed to have a uniform law of the land.'' But he noted there
had been ''no suggestion, as far as I know, that any of the cases
where the convictions occurred were wrongly decided'' and said he
would consult Reno before deciding what to do.
</P>
<P>
   Those responses didn't mollify death penalty critics in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''Additional internal reviews alone will not satisfy public
concern about our system,'' said Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis. His
office said he would introduce a new bill this week providing a
federal execution halt; he already has proposed one to stop both
federal and state executions.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold renewed a demand that he and Democratic Sens. Carl
Levin of Michigan, Paul Wellstone of Minnesota and Tom Harkin of
Iowa made in June that Clinton name a commission to study the issue
and postpone any executions until it reports. ''All Americans agree
that whether you die for committing a federal crime should not
depend arbitrarily on where you live.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., D-Ill., also demanded a moratorium
instead of ''business as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're an African American in Texas who commits a crime
that could warrant the federal death penalty, you get it. If you're
white in New York City, you probably don't. ... What is this, some
form of natural selection? Death penalty Darwinism?''
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International also urged Clinton to declare a moratorium
on executions.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy said the study ''proves once again that this is not just
an Illinois problem or a Texas problem. This is a national
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder, the study's author and
the nation's highest ranking black law enforcement officer, saw no
need for a moratorium such as the one imposed in Illinois in
January by Gov. George Ryan, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan was reacting to a period when more Illinois inmates had
their death sentences overturned than were executed, Holder said.
''That is not the case here in the federal system. The number of
cases where we have actual claims of factual innocence are less
than 1 percent.'' Those claims can be dealt with adequately through
new presidential clemency procedures, Reno and Holder said.
</P>
<P>
   Holder's study did show that death sentences in federal cases
roughly reflected the racial percentages of defendants charged with
capital crimes.
</P>
<P>
   From 1995 through July 2000, U.S. attorneys forwarded for review
the cases of 682 defendants who faced capital charges -- 20 percent
white; 80 percent, minorities.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. attorneys recommended the death penalty for 183 of them --
26 percent whites; 74 percent, minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Reno approved seeking death penalties for 159 -- 28 percent
whites; 72 percent, minorities. All involved murders.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, 20 defendants were sentenced to death -- 20 percent
whites; 80 percent, minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Geographically, only nine of the 94 U.S. attorney districts
accounted for 43 percent of the 183 defendants that prosecutors
recommended for the death penalty. They were Puerto Rico, the
eastern district of Virginia, Maryland, the eastern and southern
districts of New York, western Missouri, New Mexico, western
Tennessee and northern Texas.
</P>
<P>
   And a total of 40 districts never recommended a death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The first federal execution since 1963 is set for Dec. 12. In
August, President Clinton delayed that execution so the defendant,
convicted killer Juan Raul Garza, could use new procedures to
appeal for clemency.

<HEADLINE> House Nears Trade Tax Breaks Bill  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hoping to avert a trade war with Europe, the
House was rushing to pass legislation enacting new tax breaks for
U.S. companies to replace a system ruled an illegal export subsidy
by the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is extremely important that we send a message to the
Europeans that we're serious about this,'' said Rep. Bill Archer,
R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. ''The
mother of all trade wars is something to be avoided.''
</P>
<P>
   Backed by the Clinton administration, Congress intends to pass
the bill before an Oct. 1 deadline set by the WTO, which
invalidated the U.S. Foreign Sales Corporation tax rules after they
were challenged by the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   The WTO set the deadline to give the United States time to enact
a replacement law without retaliatory tariffs from the EU. European
officials contend that this new system is also illegal, but U.S.
officials said they would press ahead to prevent tariffs or
sanctions on up to $40 billion in U.S. exports.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Treasury Secretary Stuart Eizenstadt said the bill
represents ''the only way in which we can avoid the potential for
an immediate conflict with the EU, with the possibility of
significant retaliation on their part.''
</P>
<P>
   A final House vote was set for Wednesday. The Senate was
expected to follow suit in short order.
</P>
<P>
   Created to offset an EU tax rebate for its exporters, the
Foreign Sales Corporation program permits U.S. companies to reduce
income taxes by 15 percent through export subsidiaries set up in
offshore tax havens such as Barbados and the Virgin Islands.
Microsoft, Boeing and General Motors are only a few of the 6,000
companies, with 4.8 million workers, that get the $4.1 billion
annual tax break.
</P>
<P>
   The replacement legislation, costing the government roughly the
same amount each year, would set up new tax breaks that apply
equally to exports by U.S. companies and the products they make
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The WTO ruling against the previous rules centered on their
nature as special exceptions in tax law. Efforts to reach a
diplomatic solution failed.

<HEADLINE> House Debates Boy Scouts' Policy  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans labeled it an attack on American
values -- a House bill seeking to revoke the eight-decade-old
federal charter for the Boy Scouts of America because of the
organization's policy of excluding gays.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Cass Ballenger, R-N.C., said half the members of the House
were former scouts and would defend an organization ''as American
as apple pie and baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   While the bill's opponents accused its few Democratic supporters
of extremism, Democrats complained that the GOP's only intent was
to embarrass them.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation was expected to fail overwhelmingly Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the politics, the legislation offered by Rep. Lynn
Woolsey, D-Calif., spotlighted the uneasy relationship between the
federal government and the Boy Scouts since the organization's
stance toward gays became a national issue.
</P>
<P>
   Woolsey said she was a Girl Scout and one of her sons was a Boy
Scout ''We're not saying the Boy Scouts are bad; we're saying that
intolerance is bad.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I know the value of scouting, and that's why I believe
scouting should be available to all boys, not just to some boys,''
Woolsey said during Tuesday night's debate. She was the only
Democrat to speak in favor of the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, a long line of Republicans rose to condemn the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an attack on the fundamental values of America,'' said
Rep. Chris Cannon, R-Utah, led by ''a small group of extremists on
the minority side.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., top Democrat on the Judiciary
Committee, said Republicans were engaging in a ''political stunt''
in bringing to the floor a bill that had had no hearings or
committee vote and didn't have a chance of passage.
</P>
<P>
   Woolsey said she wasn't told until Monday evening that
Republicans were taking up her legislation. It ''was a total
surprise to me.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're disappointed that this bill would even be considered,''
Boy Scouts spokesman Gregg Shields said. Having a federal charter
is an honor and ''we hope to continue to live up to that honor,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   The Boy Scouts got their federal charter in 1916, six years
after it was founded. It is one of about 90 groups with such
designation, an honorary title given to patriotic, charitable and
education organizations.
</P>
<P>
   While it confers no specific benefits, receiving a federal
charter is a mark of prestige and national recognition for a group.
Among other groups with federal charters are the American Legion,
Future Farmers of America, the National Tropical Botanical Garden
and the National Ski Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision in June, upheld the Boy
Scouts' ban on homosexuals serving as troop leaders. That ruling
may also give legal backing to the 6.2 million-member
organization's rejection of gay youths as members.
</P>
<P>
   The Scouts asserted that homosexual conduct is inconsistent with
the values it seeks to instill.
</P>
<P>
   Separately in June, President Clinton issued an executive order
barring discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in
federally conducted education and training programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Department in August asked the Justice Department
for guidance on how that order affected the holding of Boy Scout
Jamborees on federal lands.
</P>
<P>
   GOP presidential nominee George W. Bush and other Republicans
quickly accused the Clinton administration of trying to throw the
scouts off federal lands. But Attorney General Janet Reno, in a
statement this month, said the tradition of Boy Scouts using
federal lands for camping and other activities could continue.
</P>
<P>
   After the June Supreme Court ruling, Clinton said he is
''generally against discrimination against gays.'' But he refused
to criticize the Scouts or the court's ruling. ''The Boy Scouts
still are -- they're a great group. They do a lot of good.''

<HEADLINE> Democrats Skeptical of GOP Offer  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Clinton administration officials and top
congressional Democrats are suspicious of a pre-election Republican
offer to use 90 percent of next year's expected budget surplus to
drive down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans made the offer Tuesday at a White House meeting
among President Clinton and congressional leaders that also covered
health-care proposals and other issues remaining in this Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The session, which lasted more than an hour, produced little
substantive progress.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans were hoping the meeting would be a prelude to a
bipartisan, end-of-year deal on spending and tax cuts that would
let lawmakers head home for re-election campaigns by mid-October.
The GOP proposal on the surplus would, in effect, leave about $27
billion for tax cuts and spending increases that lawmakers want for
fiscal 2001, which begins Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   With that money, ''We can provide the funding we need for
agriculture and education and tax relief for small businesses and
encourage savings'' and make pension plans more generous, Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' plan seemed to be an effort to establish
themselves as the party that favors debt reduction, and to draw a
line that Clinton dare not cross with his demands for billions in
extra spending. With control of both the White House and Congress
at stake in November, polls show that debt reduction is a favorite
of voters.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's own budget also would use more than 90 percent of
projected surpluses for debt reduction next year. He would use all
the remaining money for extra spending, not tax cuts. House Speaker
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., suggested splitting the remaining funds
evenly between extra spending and tax cuts, said participants who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said they, too, favor setting aside as much as
possible for debt reduction. But participants said Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers and others said the GOP plan could allow
tax cuts that would mushroom over the next decade and erode
Clinton's plans to eliminate the publicly held portion of the
national debt by 2012.
</P>
<P>
   ''We smell a rat,'' Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D.,
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials and Democrats also argued that if the GOP
applied its 90 percent formula to the next decade, it would
preclude the $1.3 trillion, 10-year tax cut proposed by the
Republican presidential nominee, George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''They need to tell us what it is they're for,'' said Daschle.
''If they're for a real plan, they're going to have to separate
themselves from their presidential candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   During the meeting, Republicans did not specify how they would
spend the $27 billion next year, attendees said.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans did suggest using some of the money to eliminate
the federal telephone tax and cut taxes on some small businesses,
pensions and development in inner cities, said participants from
both parties. That seemed to be an implicit acknowledgment that the
GOP's highest-profile tax cuts -- on many married couples and large
estates -- would not become law this year. Both have been vetoed by
Clinton, and Republicans lack the votes to reverse him.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's remaining priorities this year include more spending
for education and giving consumers the right to sue insurance
companies for inadequate care. He also wants new prescription drug
benefits under Medicare, an expanded hate-crimes law, a minimum
wage increase, a long-term health care credit and ''new markets''
tax breaks to spur investment in depressed communities.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we ought to do just as much as we possibly can,''
Clinton said before the meeting began.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans want reduced taxes for workers and small businesses,
and increased spending and for education. Lott said he hoped the
Senate would complete work this week or next on a major trade bill
with China.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., said the meeting
left him dubious that broadened patients' rights or drug benefits
will be approved this year. Both have been considered long-shots
for some time because of political differences over the size and
scope of the packages.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Senate Majority Whip Don Nickles, R-Okla.,
said there would be no expansion of managed-care patients' rights
this year ''if people are going to be playing partisan games.''
Daschle said Republicans threatened to filibuster a House-approved
version of the bill, which Nickles said would increase health-care
costs.
</P>
<P>
   So far, just two of the 13 annual spending bills for 2001 have
been signed into law. Republicans are hoping that serious
negotiations on the remaining measures will now begin.

<HEADLINE> Report: Transplant May Kill Cancer  </HEADLINE>
By JANET McCONNAUGHEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   An experimental approach to treat kidney cancer that uses blood
cells from a patient's sibling drastically reduced or eliminated
tumors in some patients, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   The newly harnessed cancer killers may also reverse the spread
of kidney cancer, according to the study appearing in Thursday's
New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the biggest advance in kidney cancer in my research
career -- in my almost 22 years of doing kidney cancer research,''
said Dr. Nicholas Vogelzang of University of Chicago, a medical
adviser for the Kidney Cancer Association.
</P>
<P>
   The cancer killers are T-cells, the roving attack dogs of the
immune system. When they work, they usually go after the body but
do even worse damage to tumors, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   While transfusions have been used for decades to treat leukemia
and other blood cancers, this is their first use against solid
cancers. But the authors at the National Institutes of Health
cautioned that the approach is still being studied and is itself
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   About 30,000 new cases of kidney cancer are found each year in
the United States. If it is caught before it spreads, removing the
kidney may cure the patient. But in about 11,000, it is out of the
kidney before it is found. Then it moves swiftly, often killing
within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Vogelzang said Chicago is among at least 10 institutions testing
the new approach described in the study by Dr. Richard Childs of
the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Childs and researchers at the National Cancer Institute are
preparing tests against 15 other cancers, including those of the
lung, breast, prostate and esophagus.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only way we're going to know if it works is trials. Animal
trials have not been particularly helpful,'' Childs said.
</P>
<P>
   The study describes the first 19 people to get transfusions to
treat cancer which had spread from the kidney. Tumors disappeared
completely in three, and shrank to half their former size in seven
others. Two died.
</P>
<P>
   Only two of the seven had a later relapse, and one of them
improved again after additional treatment with a different immune
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The patients got transfusions of both stem cells, the immature
cells which develop into various kinds of blood cells, and T-cells,
which destroyed tumors, Childs said.
</P>
<P>
   But the T-cells took months to work.
</P>
<P>
   Four months after John Sirmans' transplant, his tumors were
still growing. A CAT scan of his lungs ''looked like golf balls in
a sock,'' said Sirmans, of Dayton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   That was in December. He thought that Christmas would be his
last. ''Then 30 days later, I came back and these things were
shrinking like crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Childs' article lists Sirmans as a patient whose tumors had
shrunk at least by half. He has been cancer-free since summer.
</P>
<P>
   The approach should stay experimental for now and will be
nowhere near a cure-all even if more studies and longer follow-up
show that it should be an accepted treatment, Childs said.
</P>
<P>
   One problem surrounding the treatment is finding a donor.
There's only a one in four chance that a sibling's blood will be a
good enough match for the patient's. The donor also must be
healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Side effects are major. All but two patients whose tumors
improved had rashes or diarrhea and gut pain.
</P>
<P>
   No patient has been followed for more than about 2&AMP;frac12; years. Once
cancer has been in remission for five years, doctors feel there is
a reasonable chance of remaining cancer-free.

<HEADLINE> Actor Jeff Bridges Inspired by Dad  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- The memory of his late father was on Jeff Bridges'
mind when he prepared for his latest movie role as president of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   At a Statehouse ceremony Tuesday, Bridges said he studied
Presidents Clinton, Lyndon B. Johnson and John F. Kennedy, as well
as former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   But it was his father, actor Lloyd Bridges, who was an
inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ''More than any of those folks was my father and also elements
of myself. My dad was a very gregarious guy and had a lot of joy he
brought to his work,'' Bridges said.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Bridges died in 1998 at age 85.
</P>
<P>
   His son was in Boston to present an award to the winner of the
Massachusetts Film Office's screenwriting competition: Kris
Johnson, 23, of Hopkinton.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson won for his screenplay, ''Written in Water,'' about a
boy who grows up in a funeral home. Johnson will now have a chance
to pitch his screenplay to Hollywood executives, in meetings
arranged by the film office.

<HEADLINE> Book Details Lewinsky Affair  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton was unable to tell his wife
that he had lied about the Monica Lewinsky affair and had his
personal lawyer deliver the news, according to a new book about the
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney David Kendall met with Hillary Rodham Clinton in the
White House residential wing in 1998 to tell her that the president
had lied in denying the affair with Ms. Lewinsky. The disclosure
was made in ''The Breach: Inside the Impeachment and Trial of
William Jefferson Clinton,'' by Washington Post reporter Peter
Baker.
</P>
<P>
   The Post reported excerpts from the book in Wednesday editions.
</P>
<P>
   Baker writes that Clinton was so distracted by the impeachment --
which ended in his acquittal last year -- that aides at White House
meetings sometimes had to answer questions for him. And a key
adviser approached several Democratic Party leaders about a
strategy to urge him to resign when impeachment seemed almost
certain.
</P>
<P>
   In the late summer of 1998, Baker writes, a former White House
deputy chief of staff, Harold M. Ickes, ''told people that the only
possible way to convince his ex-boss to give up power would be to
put together a coalition of interest groups and key senior members
from Congress to go to him as a delegation and tell him there was
no way to hold the White House in 2000 unless he resigned.''
</P>
<P>
   Ickes broached the idea to AFL-CIO President John Sweeney and
was told: ''Let's wait and see, Harold.'' The idea faded away.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Sued by White House Chef  </HEADLINE>
By D. IAN HOPPER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A sexual harassment lawsuit brought by the
White House's assistant pastry chef against her boss, the pastry
chef, accuses President Clinton of failing to make sure such
complaints can be reported.
</P>
<P>
   Franette McColloch asserts that Roland Mesnier has subjected her
to ''severe sexual harassment'' since 1991, culminating in
stress-related medical conditions and retaliation for reporting the
alleged harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is named in the suit because, as president and head of
the White House, McColloch's attorneys say, he ultimately is
responsible for making sure that there is an avenue for reporting
alleged sexual harassment and other civil rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint, to be filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court,
claims Clinton has not done so.
</P>
<P>
   The head of a federal agency is typically named in civil rights
suits made against the agency.
</P>
<P>
   McColloch is asking for a total of $2 million -- $1 million from
Clinton and $1 million from Mesnier.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said it had not yet seen the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ''The White House is committed to ensuring equal opportunity
employment for all its employees,'' White House spokesman Jake
Siewert said. ''We cannot comment on the specific allegations in
this case, because the matter is in litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   McColloch, who has worked at the White House since 1983, says in
the complaint that Mesnier repeatedly made unwanted advances
against her and demanded to know why she would not have a sexual
relationship with him.
</P>
<P>
   In retaliation for refusing him, the complaint alleges that
Mesnier was ''hostile and rude'' to her at work, left dozens of
messages on her answering machine and took duties away from her.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint alleges that McColloch brought her complaints to
several of her superiors. She says that she was ''deliberately
misled'' into believing that she had no way to pursue her
allegations and no legal recourse. She says she was told that she
either had to remain in her position, with Mesnier as her
supervisor, or to quit her job.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in early trading Wednesday on
news of a merger between two of the country's largest banks and
continued nervousness about third-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 39.40 at 11,193.83.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index rose 2.15 to 3,851.66, and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 7.71 at 1,474.28.
</P>
<P>
   Before the market opened, Chase Manhattan Bank announced it was
acquiring J.P. Morgan for about $36 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan traded down $8.19 at $177.25 in early trading, after
weeks of its stock price inching upward on rumors that it was an
acquisition target. Chase Manhattan fell $2.63 to $49.88.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of corporate earnings unsettled the market.
</P>
<P>
   Most businesses won't report results until next month, but some
have already began hinting at what to expect. The market has fallen
into a pattern of rewarding those with strong results and outlooks,
and punishing those who falter.
</P>
<P>
   Best Buy closed Tuesday up $4.75 at $69.19 after the consumer
electronics retailer beat Wall Street estimates for second-quarter
earnings. The same day, the market sent shares of PRI Automation
down nearly 40 percent,, falling $16.81 to $25.88, after the
factory automation systems maker said fourth-quarter earnings would
not meet expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The market closed mixed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down Wednesday at 1.82 at 530.61.

<P>
   On Monday, the Dow, Nasdaq and S&AMP;P all declined, continuing

<HEADLINE> Chef's Harassment Suit Cites Clinton  </HEADLINE>
By D. IAN HOPPER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A sexual harassment lawsuit brought by the
White House's assistant pastry chef against her boss, the pastry
chef, accuses President Clinton of failing to make sure such
complaints can be reported.
</P>
<P>
   Franette McColloch asserts that Roland Mesnier has subjected her
to ''severe sexual harassment'' since 1991, culminating in
stress-related medical conditions and retaliation for reporting the
alleged harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is named in the suit because, as president and head of
the White House, McColloch's attorneys say, he ultimately is
responsible for making sure that there is an avenue for reporting
alleged sexual harassment and other civil rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court, claims
Clinton has not done so.
</P>
<P>
   The head of a federal agency is typically named in civil rights
suits made against the agency.
</P>
<P>
   McColloch is asking for a total of $2 million -- $1 million from
Clinton and $1 million from Mesnier.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said it had not yet seen the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart declined comment on the
lawsuit but said the White House ''is committed to ensuring equal
employment opportunity for all its employees and takes allegations
of employment discrimination seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   McColloch, who has worked at the White House since 1983, says in
the complaint that Mesnier repeatedly made unwanted advances
against her and demanded to know why she would not have a sexual
relationship with him.
</P>
<P>
   In retaliation for refusing him, the complaint alleges that
Mesnier was ''hostile and rude'' to her at work, left dozens of
messages on her answering machine and took duties away from her.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint alleges that McColloch brought her complaints to
several of her superiors. She says that she was ''deliberately
misled'' into believing that she had no way to pursue her
allegations and no legal recourse. She says she was told that she
either had to remain in her position, with Mesnier as her
supervisor, or to quit her job.

<HEADLINE> NY Opera Season Opens Favorably  </HEADLINE>
By MARY CAMPBELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A new production of ''Roberto Devereux'' has
scenery which looks like a modern nightclub, striking costumes and
a baritone who steals the show.
</P>
<P>
   Voices were good; one was better than that. But anyone who was
in the audience in 1970 when the company first did the piece --
opera lovers who Julius Rudel conduct, and saw Beverly Sills' Queen
Elizabeth I drum her fists on the arms of her throne -- missed the
passion and excitement of those performances.
</P>
<P>
   There is drama in Donizetti's music, so excitement wasn't
entirely missing. Tuesday's performance -- which opened the fall
season for the City Opera -- just didn't have that extra frisson of
thrill that great performances have.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren Flanagan, the company's reigning soprano, hit her notes
squarely and produced volume when it was needed. But she has seemed
more comfortable in other roles. Mezzo-soprano Jane Dutton made her
New York City Opera debut as the Duchess of Nottingham. Her voice
has the clarity of a bell-like soprano. Tenor Fernando De La Mora
also was making his debut with the company, in the title role. His
voice is dark, and pleasing.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Delavan as the Duke of Nottingham has a warm, rich baritone
of remarkable beauty. Even when he berated his wife, his tones were
round. Delavan, like the late Leonard Warren, can unbalance a cast
of singers; he pulls the audience to him even when he isn't singing
the leading role.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Lamos directed. Both the set designer, Andrew Lieberman,
and the costume designer, Judy Levin, make their City Opera debuts
with this production.
</P>
<P>
   And both the sets and the costumes are worth noting.
</P>
<P>
   The set had a red-floored stage at one side with three wide red
steps down. On one side of that stage was ''Gloriana'' spelled in
vertically in red neon. On the other side was a blue neon ''Regina
XIII'' -- for Elizabeth, the 13th queen of England. Across from all
that, the throne sat on a blue square lighted from inside. Above
the throne was a theater marquee with ''Elisabetta'' written on two
sides.
</P>
<P>
   The Elizabethan costumes were mostly red, black and white. The
red-wigged chorus -- which is a chorus in this opera, not
townspeople -- usually stood in rows on the red stage. This produced
attractive tableaux and, while the scenery and costumes were
incongruous, they didn't annoy.
</P>
<P>
   George Manahan conducted. The New York City Opera's fall season
runs through Nov. 19 at the New York State Theater.

<HEADLINE> Dow Falls 35; Nasdaq Rises 23  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed Wednesday on news of a merger
between two of the country's largest banks and continued
nervousness about third-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   In morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average fell 35.15 to 11,198.08.
</P>
<P>
   But broader stock indicators moved higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 2.79 at 1,484.78 , and
the Nasdaq composite index rose 22.62 to 3,872.13.
</P>
<P>
   Before the market opened, Chase Manhattan Bank announced it was
acquiring J.P. Morgan for about $36 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan traded down $6.31 at $179.13 in morning trading,
after weeks of its stock price inching upward on rumors that it was
an acquisition target. Chase Manhattan fell $2.31 to $50.19.
</P>
<P>
   Investors also continued to monitor corporate earnings
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Although most businesses won't report results until next month,
some have already began hinting at what to expect. The market has
fallen into its pattern of rewarding those who deliver strong
profits and outlooks, and punishing those who don't.
</P>
<P>
   SCI Systems was off $13, about 23 percent, at $42.94 after the
electronics manufacturer said its quarterly results would fall
below expectations, because of seasonal weakness in demand for its
products. SCI also said it is acquiring an Australian-based
telecommunications business to expand its global reach.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Sherwin Williams dropped $2.63 to $21.25 after the
paint company said quarterly earnings would not meet Wall Street
expectations because of higher raw material costs and tough
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're still half a month away from actual earnings season, but
we've already had key reports like DuPont saying it will be down.
The market has not taken that news well,'' said Ricky Harrington, a
senior vice president at Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, N.C.
''It's somewhat subjective, but I think the runup of stocks that we
saw before Labor Day has set the stage for downside surprises.''
</P>
<P>
   DuPont shares fell sharply last week after the chemical company
said its earnings would be below expectations because of rising
costs and soft markets.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by a narrow margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 345.09 million
shares, compared with 320.04 million in the last session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 0.57 at 533.00.

<HEADLINE> Albright, Ministers Meet about Haiti  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met
Wednesday with diplomats from Argentina, Canada, Chile, France and
Venezuela to pressure Haiti to strengthen democratic procedures in
advance of presidential and legislative elections in November.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration already has vowed to impose economic
sanctions on Haiti if it does not change its ways.
</P>
<P>
   The group convened by Albright calls itself ''Friends of
Haiti.'' Meeting with her were Foreign Ministers Lloyd Axworthy of
Canada and Soledad Alvear of Chile. High-ranking Argentine, French
and Venezuelan diplomats attended, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Luis Lauredo, U.S. ambassador to the Organization of
American States, accused Haitian authorities of an unwillingness to
address the ''serious irregularities and deficiencies'' that he
said were evident during parliamentary runoff elections in May.
</P>
<P>
   The runoff, along with balloting in June and July, resulted in
overwhelming victories for the Lavalas Family party of former
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who is expected to win
re-election to the presidency in November.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the absence of meaningful change,'' Lauredo said, ''the
United States will not support the presidential and legislative
elections of Nov. 26, financially or through observer missions,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lauredo said the U.S. government would send nearly all bilateral
assistance to the people of Haiti through private and
nongovernmental organizations, thus bypassing the Haitian
government.
</P>
<P>
   A former Haitian senator, Paul Denis, of the former
parliamentary minority Struggling People's Organization, hailed
''the evolution'' of the U.S. position and said it would support
the struggle of the Haitian people against a government that wants
to establish a dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, in what was her last official speech to the United
Nations, said Tuesday ''democracy is the one road we can all walk
down together.''
</P>
<P>
   She also pledged ''to serve the cause of international progress
and individual liberty not only for as long as I am in office, but
for as long as I am alive.''

<HEADLINE> Nashville: John Michael Montgomery  </HEADLINE>
By JIM PATTERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Serious is selling again in the country
music industry. And an old-fashioned tear-jerker is shaping up as
one of the year's most talked-about country singles.
</P>
<P>
   John Michael Montgomery's ''The Little Girl,'' written by
Nashville songwriter Harley Allen, is a song about child abuse,
murder and suicide. An orphaned girl sees a picture of Jesus Christ
while attending Sunday School for the first time. She identifies
him as the man who comforted her as she hid behind a couch on the
night her father killed her mother and then himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to show I could sing a song with a serious issue in
it,'' said Montgomery. ''It was kind of a 50-50 risk. ... We could
have had people going, 'It's talking about religious issues, it's
talking about killing people; we don't want that on our radio
waves.'''
</P>
<P>
   The single shot into the Top 15 on the Billboard country singles
chart just five weeks after its release. The song is included on
Montgomery's ''Brand New Me'' CD (Atlantic Records).
</P>
<P>
   ''We played the song once and got about 75 calls,'' said Michael
J. Foxx, the music director at WPOC in Baltimore. ''This song ranks
in the top five of all time in positive testing in the history of
the station.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery, who admits he's recorded his share of ''bubble gum''
country, hopes ''The Little Girl'' will have the commercial impact
of Brad Paisley's 1999 hit ''He Didn't Have to Be,'' a song that
praised stepparents.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, mainstream country got decidedly lighthearted.
There were a few hits with serious themes: Garth Brooks' ''The
Thunder Rolls'' in 1991 and Martina McBride's ''Independence Day''
in 1994 both dealt with domestic violence. Collin Raye carved a
niche for himself with such issue songs as ''I Think About You.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the decade wore on, the industry increasingly promoted
breezy, upbeat songs in an attempt to win over younger listeners.
Hit singles included Montgomery's silly tongue-twisting hits ''Be
My Baby Tonight'' (1994) and ''Sold (The Grundy County Auction
Incident)'' in 1995; Tracy Byrd's 1994 dance song ''Watermelon
Crawl''; Faith Hill's ''This Kiss'' in 1998, a sunny ode to first
love; and Kenny Chesney's trifling 1999 hit, ''She Thinks My
Tractor's Sexy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the tide appears to be turning with some significant songs
about serious topics.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Ann Womack scored her biggest hit ever with this year's
inspirational ''I Hope You Dance.'' Sonya Isaacs' single ''Barefoot
in the Grass'' is about a woman with terminal cancer. Child singer
Billy Gilman's first hit was ''One Voice,'' which tackled the issue
of guns in schools.
</P>
<P>
   Allison Moorer's ''The Cold Cold Earth,'' a hidden track on her
new album, is the story of her parents' murder-suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Is ''The Little Girl'' a true story? The answer isn't clear.
Allen got the idea from a story that was posted on the Internet and
e-mailed to him by his brother.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had those conversations about whether it was too (serious
and depressing) to be a hit,'' said Rick Baumgarner, who promotes
singles to radio stations for Atlantic Records, Montgomery's record
label.
</P>
<P>
   ''We finally realized that we needed to swing for the fences and
let the listeners decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Baumgarner said the success of the Dixie Chicks' ''Goodbye
Earl'' single was a factor in the decision to go ahead. That song,
about an abusive husband who is murdered by his wife and a friend,
was criticized as treating premeditated murder as a lighthearted
romp.
</P>
<P>
   ''It created passion,'' he said. ''It got the phones ringing, as
opposed to other songs that do OK, but don't really create
excitement.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery, 35, said he recorded ''The Little Girl'' to display
his versatility. He plans to continue recording the lighter songs
and love ballads that have made him famous. Each is represented
alongside ''The Little Girl'' on his new album.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, I'm more mature now as a person and as an artist,''
he said. ''But nobody wants to hear sad songs or mature songs all
day long. And nobody wants to hear bubble gum songs all day long.
It's fun to mix and match them up.''

<HEADLINE> Met Explores Pivotal Time  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE ROTH
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Strolling through the Metropolitan Museum of
Art's first major American exhibit in three decades is an
awe-inspiring journey through the rise of money, power and
creativity in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ''The second quarter of the 19th century was an amazing time in
this city,'' said Catherine Hoover Voorsanger, who organized the
show with John K. Howat. ''The New York we know today was really
created during this period.''
</P>
<P>
   But ''Art and the Empire City: New York, 1825-1861,'' which
opens Sept. 19 and runs through Jan. 7, 2001, is also about much
more than the city itself.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is about the art history of this country as seen through
the lens of New York, which becomes the cultural and commercial
capital of the country during this time period, and the largest
city in the Western Hemisphere,'' Voorsanger said.
</P>
<P>
   She said it is the first American exhibit of its size at the
museum since 1970.
</P>
<P>
   The show covers the time between the completion of the Erie
Canal and the start of the Civil War, an era when artists first
found they had to come to New York if they were going to be truly
successful, and when the term ''shopping'' was coined.
</P>
<P>
   Lord &AMP; Taylor opened in 1826, Tiffany's (then known as Tiffany
and Young) opened in 1837 and Central Park opened in 1859 (the Met
itself was formed in 1870). The Associated Press and The New York
Times were both founded during this period.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's as obvious as the nose on our face. New York was the
center of things starting from 1825. But it's a period that's
really been overlooked,'' Voorlanger said. ''The density of
material is staggering.''
</P>
<P>
   The show is ambitious and there's a lot to cover, a testimony to
the wealth and creative energy of the period. The exhibit has been
underway for five years during which a wish list of over 1,000
works was honed down to 310 gems from 84 lenders in the United
States and Europe. Many of the pieces have never before been on
public display.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit is accompanied by a catalog of the same name, with
hundreds of color illustrations and a text by over a dozen writers.
</P>
<P>
   Opening with a replica of the Battery Park boardwalk -- complete
with a couple dressed up for a 19th-century stroll, ''Art and the
Empire City'' is divided into a dozen galleries organized
thematically within a chronological framework.
</P>
<P>
   It all starts with art works surrounding the 1825 competition of
the Erie Canal, which established the city as the gateway to the
West. Highlights include a full-length portrait of the Marquis de
Lafayette, much beloved at the time for his role in the
Revolutionary War, by Samuel F.B. Morse (on loan from City Hall),
and a pair of monumental silver vases given to Gov. De Witt Clinton
for his role in envisioning and overseeing the building of the
canal.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes a portrait gallery that recalls the Governor's Room
in City Hall as it looked around 1825. It is a window into the
important personalities of the time: Alexander Hamilton, the
nation's first Secretary of Treasury, painter John Trumbull,
President Andrew Jackson, newspaper editor and publisher William
Cullen Bryant and author Washington Irving.
</P>
<P>
   Next is a gallery on neoclassical architecture, with
architectural drawings and a facade from the Branch Bank of the
United States. And the fourth gallery, with furnishings dating from
1830 to 1845, gives you the feel of one of the period's upscale
homes. Besides stunning ceramics, glassware, silver and
furnishings, it includes pilasters -- rectangular supports or
columns -- and a mahogany door from a grand Grecian house built in
Brooklyn in the 1830s.
</P>
<P>
   A gallery examines the interrelationship between the visual arts
and literature -- including masterworks like Thomas Cole's 1825
painting, ''Last of the Mohicans,'' inspired by the James Fennimore
Cooper novel.
</P>
<P>
   Another explores the world of connoisseurship and art
collecting. We see some of the works that city dwellers of the time
would have appreciated at a time when top quality foreign art works
were on public display or were acquired by wealthy New Yorkers for
their private collections.
</P>
<P>
   In the next is a sampling of works and displays seen in 1853 at
a major fair in The New York Crystal Palace, housed in a grand
building of cast-iron and glass in midtown Manhattan which stood
where Bryant Park, alongside the New York Public Library, is now
located.
</P>
<P>
   In counterpoint to the portrait gallery at the beginning of the
show, the gallery ''Photography, the New Medium'' shows early New
York daguerreotypes and paper prints. Suddenly, this new style of
portraiture becomes accessible for anyone from the illustrious P.T.
Barnum and Walt Whitman to a fireman (who poses with hat and horn)
and a grocery boy with his parcel. There are even a few of the
earliest art photos, which look startlingly contemporary.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Great Emporium'' makes you think of window shopping on
Madison Avenue or Fifth Avenue and shows what made some of the
city's first shopaholics drool. There are elegant gowns and
gleaming silver, ornate furniture and pearled jewelry from the
early Tiffany's worn by Abraham Lincoln's wife -- with lots in
between.
</P>
<P>
   The following gallery features early maps and plans of what was
by then dubbed the ''Empire City,'' and another shows works by
American artists who were famous when, in the 1840s, New York
became the center of the nation's art scene.
</P>
<P>
   The show culminates with a dramatic display of Frederic Edwin
Church's monumental 1859 painting, ''The Heart of the Andes,''
presented as it was originally -- as a single picture in a darkened
room. It is shown in a reconstruction of the original elaborate,
freestanding wooden frame.
</P>
<P>
   The work was displayed at a fair in New York in 1864, which
inspired the citizens of New York to call for a city museum. That
museum was the Met itself, and the show's grand finale comes full
circle back to modern day New York.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutor Talks About Depression  </HEADLINE>
By ESTES THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- James Blackburn was a legal star, the newly
minted prosecutor who convinced a federal jury that Jeffrey
MacDonald killed his pregnant wife and young daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is a man taking small steps on the road to reclaiming his
life, after detours that took him to the other side of the
courtroom and the inside of a state prison, then to a job waiting
tables at a restaurant where he was once a favorite guest.
</P>
<P>
   He relates that journey in a new book, ''Flame-Out: From
Prosecuting Jeffrey MacDonald to Serving Time and Serving Tables.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Life has been measured for me the last seven years in
milestones other people don't think about,'' Blackburn, 55, said in
the sparsely furnished state office where he now works.
</P>
<P>
   He still takes Prozac daily to treat the depression that helped
push him to take $234,000 from his law firm to pay -- among other
things -- a court judgment he had faked, including judges'
signatures, in a client's favor.
</P>
<P>
   He pleaded guilty to forgery, fraud, embezzlement and
obstruction of justice in November 1993 and was in prison for 3&AMP;frac12;
months, an eternity for a man accustomed to sending people there.
When he got out, he spent about a year running the office of his
mentor, Sen. Robert Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1995, he went to work at 42nd Street Oyster Bar,
a place where he had regularly lunched with colleagues and
celebrated with friends. He was a host until he realized he could
make better money from a waiter's tips.
</P>
<P>
   He became assistant to the director of the state retirement fund
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Blackburn shed some of his beloved possessions --
his law license, a BMW convertible, a country club membership -- and
gave the law firm his equity in the company and office furnishings.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a Baptist minister, he was amazed by people he calls
angels -- people he didn't know who wanted to help him. He recalls a
man offering help as he waited for a hamburger the day before he
went to prison. Another man handed Blackburn a $100 bill while he
was waiting tables.
</P>
<P>
   He considers the book as marking the end of that part of his
life.
</P>
<P>
   Like so much else, he said, his book came about with help from
friends. Blackburn formed Leslie Books -- his middle name -- and
borrowed $16,000 and supporters' expertise to get it printed. He
has a Web site that is also kept up with friends' help. The old
sedan he drives was a gift.
</P>
<P>
   His re-entry to society also came through the grace of people
who took him places he wouldn't go otherwise, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The book is mailed from his dining room with help from his
family: wife Marsha, son Jeff and daughter Stacy, who told her
father six years ago that a book would help him heal. It's also
being sold in some stores in North Carolina and on Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Marsha Blackburn, shy of publicity, wouldn't be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   ''She has my everlasting admiration because she exhibited at
least as much courage as he did,'' said lawyer Wade Smith, who
defended MacDonald, an Army doctor, on charges that he had stabbed
to death his pregnant wife, Collette, and daughters Kimberly and
Kristen at their home in Fort Bragg in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Smith also was part of the defense team for his old courtroom
adversary, and later wrote the foreword to Blackburn's book.
</P>
<P>
   Blackburn was famous as a prosecutor who had a friendly manner
that charmed juries. He had been an assistant federal prosecutor
for less than two years when he tried his first murder case in 1979
and won a conviction against MacDonald.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor's problems began when he entered private practice
after serving two years as the U.S. attorney for eastern North
Carolina. When Blackburn began to slide, he was a managing partner
of one of the state's largest law firms.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was unable to accept defeat,'' Smith said. ''He expected
that he would win all his cases dramatically. He couldn't face the
truth about himself that all of us have to face -- no lawyer has
magic tricks. We just do the best we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackburn is no longer interested in reapplying for his law
license, and hopes the book will lead to a career as an author of
crime and court mysteries and as a public speaker about depression.
</P>
<P>
   ''People say I used depression as a legal defense,'' he said.
''That's the hardest part to talk about in the book because it's
the most personal. I'm the most vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to beat myself up over that. If people like me,
great. If people don't like me, that's OK.''

   Excerpts from Jim Blackburn's book, ''Flame-out: From
Prosecuting Jeffrey MacDonald to Serving Time to Serving Tables'':
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''I developed an unnatural and unreasonable expectation of
myself and what I could accomplish for my clients. I never wanted
them to lose or be unhappy with the result of their case. Over
time, I developed tremendous difficulty with telling some clients
the bad news that they had no chance of winning a settlement or
staying out of prison. I believed, sometimes unreasonably, that
there was always hope.'' -- Blackburn on what led to his downfall.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''I had no plan, except now I'd tell the truth. I tried not to
stop and think about the consequences of what I was now doing or
saying. I just kept to the plan: tell the truth.'' -- Blackburn's
strategy after being caught stealing from his law firm.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   ''If we are what we wear, then I had sunk to the bottom.'' --
Blackburn on checking into jail and being issued an orange
jumpsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''Within these pages is hope for people who are battling
depression or whose loved ones battle it. Jim Blackburn became Job,
sitting beside the road, covered in ashes and dust. He looked in a
mirror and saw the truth and then, fearlessly, he spoke it. ...
Once he told the whole truth about himself, he was freer than any
of his detractors.'' -- Friend and MacDonald defense lawyer Wade
Smith, in the book's foreword.

<HEADLINE> Blues Legend Still Performing  </HEADLINE>
By PATRICK CASEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- B.B. King has just opened a new nightclub in New
York City's Times Square. He and Eric Clapton are riding the wave
of a hot, new album, and last February, he won yet another Grammy
Award.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and King's 75th birthday is Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   That and more than 200 concert dates a year is all part of what
makes the legendary guitarist ''the king of the blues.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing is really driving me. I am doing what I like to do,''
King said in a recent telephone interview. ''Playing the blues is
one part of it. I like meeting people, entertaining people.''
</P>
<P>
   King has been doing just that from the time he discovered the
guitar as a youngster at the Holiness Church in Kilmicheal, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   It was there that King met the Rev. Archie Fair, a preacher who
directed his flock by playing guitar. He taught the eager youngster
how to play a few licks.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was the one who motivated me to be a musician,'' King said.
''I wanted to play the guitar like he did.''
</P>
<P>
   As a young man, King played blues and gospel music on the
streets of towns in Mississippi and Tennessee, and in the late
1940s, hooked up with bluesman Sonny Boy Williamson, who had a show
on a Memphis, Tenn., radio station.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson eventually gave King some airtime and set up the
musician with one of his first gigs.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was one of the first to help me in the business,'' King
said. ''He's a great person.''
</P>
<P>
   King went on to record dozens of albums over the ensuing
decades. His signature songs include ''Sweet Sixteen'' and ''The
Thrill Is Gone,'' which he wrote after the breakup of his second
marriage in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   ''Riding With the King'' (Duck/Reprise), King's collaboration
with Clapton, debuted at No. 3 on The Billboard 200 in June and
already has been certified platinum. King calls the album -- the
musicians' first despite a friendship that began in the 1960s -- his
best ever.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we did some good work,'' he said. ''This one has gone
further and done better than anything else we have done, so I think
it would be the best.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Clapton, said King, who ''picked the songs, picked the
studio and the cover of the CD. He is a genius. He is a very
remarkable young man.''
</P>
<P>
   King was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1984. Three
years later, he earned a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. He is
also a member of the Songwriters Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   He demurs when asked if there is anyone new on the music scene
that he would like to play with.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can answer your question better if you ask me who I would
not like to play with,'' he said. ''I can't think of anybody. It
don't all have to be blues people. It's people. I like to play with
people. I like music. I think I have played with John Lee Hooker to
Pavarotti. I like to play with people.''
</P>
<P>
   The blues legend also likes the Internet, a medium he thinks
will prove beneficial to musicians despite the technology bomb that
Napster recently dropped on the recording industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a good way to promote your music, but copyright and
things of that sort are something that will have to be worked out
and they will be worked out,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I remember when they didn't want you to have a VCR, but they
worked it out and I think for the best. Smart people always get
together and work it out.''
</P>
<P>
   King knows the blues of 2000 are not the same as the songs he
learned as a sharecropper's son in Mississippi, but he's confident
the genre is moving in a good direction.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got the young people today and they got their ideas
about music, blues, whatever. They not only have their ideas about
it, they are playing it and supporting it,'' he said. ''It has
evolved quite a bit from when I was a kid to now.''
</P>
<P>
   King says he's evolved as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I have gotten better. I know I have tried to get
better,'' he said. ''I see things a lot different today at 74 than
I did when I was 14. For one thing, wisdom comes with age. Don't
you think so?''
</P>
<P>
   King says he's unsure what the blues will be like 20 years from
now. ''But I am very optimistic about the way it is going.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is more popular today than it ever was since I have been
trying to play it, so that gives me reason to be optimistic,'' he
said. ''I am hoping that one day you can turn on your radio and you
won't be segregated with the music. You will be able to get some of
all kinds.''
</P>
<P>
   And B.B.? What about you?
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not doing too bad for a 74-year-old,'' King said.

<HEADLINE> Crowe Delivers Portrait of Himself  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Cameron Crowe's movies are deeply personal,
with alter egos played by the likes of John Cusack and Tom Cruise
dramatizing facets of the writer-director's own character.
</P>
<P>
   With ''Almost Famous,'' Crowe's first film since ''Jerry
Maguire,'' he lays it all bare: his fractious family history, his
teen-age days as a goggle-eyed music journalist, even the sweetly
lurid tale of how he lost his virginity.
</P>
<P>
   ''Almost Famous,'' opening Friday, fictionalizes Crowe's
precocious entry -- at 15 -- writing rock 'n roll for Rolling Stone
magazine. But the fiction is marginal, presenting a composite rock
tour and a make-believe band as backdrop for events Crowe says
really happened.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's mostly my experiences just kind of put in the Cuisinart
and spun around, given some different dramatic form,'' Crowe, 43,
said during an interview in his hometown of San Diego, where much
of ''Almost Famous'' is set.
</P>
<P>
   Crowe says he borrowed lines once spoken by his own mother
(played by Frances McDormand), including her quip that
''adolescence is a marketing tool.'' He details a generational
split between his mother and his sister. He creates the fictional
'70s band Stillwater, whose leader is played by Billy Crudup, to
provide a glimpse of the rock scene he witnessed while profiling
Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, Crosby, Stills &AMP; Nash and other acts.
</P>
<P>
   While traveling with Stillwater, Crowe's ''Almost Famous''
stand-in William Miller (newcomer Patrick Fugit) loses his
virginity to three ''band aids'' -- young rock devotees accompanying
the group. It's virtually the same scene Crowe underwent himself,
he said, right down to the Steely Dan song playing on television at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we were filming, he wouldn't come out and say it really
happened,'' Fugit said. ''But when we were filming the scene with
the three girls, I wanted to say, 'Cameron, are you bragging?'''
</P>
<P>
   Most people would shy away from such personal revelations. But
Crowe said the film had been itching to come out even as he was
writing his directorial debut, the acclaimed teen romance ''Say
Anything,'' in the late 1980s. Crowe previously wrote the
screenplay for ''Fast Times at Ridgemont High,'' based on his book.
</P>
<P>
   Crowe always viewed his '70s rock film as his ''next movie,''
but kept putting it off because he could not hit on the right
approach for such a personal story.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tried many different ways,'' Crowe said. ''It's the easiest
thing in the world to give up on. It's easy to say, 'Oh, it's never
doing to work. I always liked 'Hawaii Five-O.' Maybe I can do a
movie about 'Hawaii Five-O' instead.' You just pingpong into the
most non-personal of ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   After ''Say Anything,'' which starred Cusack, Crowe went on to
the romantic comedy ''Singles'' and then ''Jerry Maguire,'' which
earned Oscar nominations for Cruise, Crowe's screenplay and for
best picture.
</P>
<P>
   Both films were personal matters for Crowe: ''Singles,'' for his
interest in Seattle's music scene, and ''Jerry Maguire,'' a take on
Crowe's sense of abandonment by friends and associates who were
disappointed with ''Singles.''
</P>
<P>
   In ''Jerry Maguire,'' Cruise plays a sports agent shunned by
colleagues and athletes when he begins to question his
wheeling-and-dealing lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did feel abandoned by a lot of my friends,'' Crowe said. ''I
actually had some of those experiences Jerry Maguire goes through
where people suddenly don't return his phone calls.''
</P>
<P>
   The success of ''Jerry Maguire'' opened new opportunities for
Crowe, who was offered more big-studio, big-star films. But he
decided it was time for his own story.
</P>
<P>
   Crowe took some time out to do the recently published
''Conversations With Wilder,'' a collection of interviews with
legendary director Billy Wilder. Then he launched himself into
''Almost Famous.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie is heavy on musical nostalgia, featuring winsome
scenes set to Simon &AMP; Garfunkel's ''America'' and Elton John's
''Tiny Dancer,'' plus hard-rock songs created in '70s style for the
band Stillwater. ''Almost Famous'' also includes a score by Crowe's
wife, Nancy Wilson of the rock band Heart.
</P>
<P>
   While music is central to the film, ''Almost Famous'' really is
a story about family and connecting with kindred souls. William
Miller strikes up a bittersweet relationship with lead band aid
Penny Lane (Kate Hudson).
</P>
<P>
   ''Cameron's one of my favorite directors,'' Hudson said. ''One
thing I love about his work is that everything's based on love. In
all of his movies, he touches on love in such a real and profound
way without making it sappy.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, William bonds in an unusual way with Crudup's
character, Russell Hammond, Stillwater's searing guitarist. The two
form a complicated friendship, with their mutual love for music
overcoming the band's view of all journalists as ''the enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Working with Cameron, I felt I was working with somebody after
something complex and multilayered,'' Crudup said. ''That's what I
strive for. To be associated with somebody much smarter than me,
saying something much more important and vital than I could come up
with.''
</P>
<P>
   William also takes up with a mentor, rock writer Lester Bangs
(Philip Seymour Hoffman), who was a guide and role model for Crowe
when he began covering music.
</P>
<P>
   The most interesting relationship is that between William and
his mother Elaine, who seems frantically overprotective yet
ultimately is the most caring and liberal-minded of parents. Crowe
said the sparring between William and Elaine closely captures the
relationship with his own mother, who was on the set much of the
time.
</P>
<P>
   When they met, Crowe's mother told McDormand she found Elaine to
be written rather shrilly and said she hoped the actress did not
intend to play the character that way.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said, 'You know what? I don't think she is shrill,'''
McDormand said. ''I don't think she's you, and I don't think she's
me. She's Elaine, now.' And we talked about how regardless of
whether a character might be based on an actual person, once it
becomes a movie, it's a fictional character from that point on.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Crowe views ''Almost Famous'' as less a work of fiction
than a faithful document of his time as that gawking boy thrust
into the world of his musical heroes, a personal yet accessible
coming-of-age story in rarefied circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never wanted this movie to feel like the movie at the bottom
of the drawer that you've got to endure because the guy had a
success before it. There's a very particular cologne about those
kinds of projects. I'm really proud that this movie is not a vanity
piece,'' Crowe said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really can put this away, now. I really can say, 'You know,
I made a movie about it.' And it comes pretty damn close to the way
it felt.''

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Ronnie Spector  </HEADLINE>
By MARY CAMPBELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Remember the Ronettes? They recorded the hits
''Be My Baby,'' ''Baby I Love You'' and ''Walkin' in the Rain'' in
the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Now Ronnie Spector, the group's lead singer, is cutting a new
record, after several decades of relative musical inactivity. Not
that she's been totally out of the music scene.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Spector recorded ''Say Goodbye to Hollywood''
with Bruce Springsteen and ''Take Me Home Tonight'' with Eddie
Money. She sang on a doo-wop Christmas album and last year,
recorded ''She Talks to Rainbows,'' an EP on the Kill Rock Stars
label.
</P>
<P>
   Spector doesn't have a label for the album yet, but she's
confident someone will want it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope I blow everybody's mind. If things you hope for don't
come true, you go on with your life. But I feel like it's my
turn,'' said Spector, whose maiden name was Veronica Bennett.
''I've waited long enough. I want to show what a rock 'n' roll
voice looks like, sounds like and is like. I'm 57, and I'm still
singing in the same keys.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the interview, Spector sounds dynamic, singing in
a recording studio with a seven-piece band and shaking her hips to
the rock 'n' roll beat.
</P>
<P>
   The Ronettes cut their first record in 1961. Record producer
Phil Spector signed them to Phillies Records in 1963 and produced
their hits. He married Ronnie in 1968, then kept her locked in
their Beverly Hills mansion. The couple divorced in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Spector sued her ex-husband for the Ronettes' record
royalties. Although a judge this year awarded $2.6 million to the
Ronettes, she expects Spector to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Spector performs as part of oldies shows in cities
across the nation. While she's in a town to perform in an oldies
show, she often sings in clubs frequented by young people.
</P>
<P>
   1. Do you like doing oldies shows?
</P>
<P>
   Spector: Yes, Dion, Little Anthony, Frankie Valli, the Four
Tops, I adore those voices. If I had a No. 1 with this new record
and they invited me, I would still do them. You get people who
remember you. I'm not erased. I'm not gone.
</P>
<P>
   2. Did you remarry?
</P>
<P>
   Spector: Yes. I went out with Jonathan Greenfield for three
years before we married. He manages me. Our boys, Jason and Austin,
are 16 and 17. I have wonderful in-laws, sister-in-law, two
brothers-in-law. I wanted to be a regular wife and mom. I have
everything now I wanted 30 years ago. It's never too late; I guess
that saying is true.
</P>
<P>
   3. How do you feel when you perform?
</P>
<P>
   Spector: I feel so free. Now I'm available to do concerts; I'm
not so busy raising two boys. Even at rehearsals, I get so excited.
I love it. Even a week after a show, I'm still going, 'doo-wah,
doo-wah.'
</P>
<P>
   4. Have you changed your singing style?

   Spector: I stick with the style people heard on the radio. I
never get tired of 'Be My Baby,' and Brian Wilson wrote 'Don't
Worry Baby' for me as a follow-up to that. My ex wouldn't let me
sing it because he didn't own the publishing (rights). But I got to
do it 30 years later. And I still have to be spontaneous. We put
our hair up and if it fell down, fine. We did natural stuff. We
wanted to be sexy. The guys wanted to go to bed with us and the
girls wanted to be like us. Hearing them both screaming made you
more sexy up there.
</P>
<P>
   5. Do you stay in touch with old friends?
</P>
<P>
   Spector: I've been knowing Keith Richards forever, since the
Stones opened for us in England in 1963. He came over to play on a
couple of songs for the new album. It's wonderful to have good
friends backing me up. They all know how long I've been waiting to
have my turn. Keith said, 'They thought we were going to die,
Ronnie, and here we are.'

<HEADLINE> London Art Scene Bustles and Booms  </HEADLINE>
By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- In 1921, French art dealer Rene Gimpel wanted to
arrange an exhibition in London for a painter he knew.
</P>
<P>
   His book, ''Diary of an Art Dealer,'' records that only three
London galleries showed contemporary art, and one of those
restricted itself to English painters. All three galleries were in
the smart West End.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are more than 900 galleries in London for
contemporary art, spread all over the capital, with the largest
concentration in the tough East End.
</P>
<P>
   The East End, once an artistic desert, is home, workplace and
showplace these days for an astonishing 20,000 professional
artists, attracted by low rents and much space in disused
industrial and office buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over 150 new galleries have opened in London in the past 18
months, and the launch of Tate Modern has had a euphoric effect,''
says Heather Waddell, who for 20 years has chronicled and
photographed the changing scene with her guidebooks to art in the
capital.
</P>
<P>
   The eighth edition of her 280-page ''London Art and Artists
Guide'' shows what an industry art supports, with its lists of
galleries, studios, materials shops, publishers, print firms,
workshops, schools and museums.
</P>
<P>
   ''One successful gallery opening like White Cube in Hoxton --
another formerly very poor district -- quickly leads to others, like
those in Hackney and Spitalfields, areas which used to be dead for
art and despised as places to live in,'' she says. ''The art boom
makes them places to visit and can lead to rejuvenation of an
entire borough.
</P>
<P>
   ''New York City has over 1,300 galleries and is important for
selling, but London has the edge in producing new and exciting
works of art and there's an insatiable appetite for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Waddell noted that this year's London Art Fair sold works
totaling more than $18 million in under a week, up from $15 million
last year and $9 million the year before that.
</P>
<P>
   The boom has been helped by corporate sponsorship as big
companies and banks pay for international exhibitions and buy art
to put on their walls, and is likely to go on for some time as
Britain's National Lottery, now in its sixth year, continues to
pour money into the arts.
</P>
<P>
   The new Tate Modern for 20th-century and contemporary art in the
disused Bankside Power Station on the south bank of the Thames is
just one of the many lottery-funded arts projects in London.
</P>
<P>
   Others are the Wallace Collection of antique arts, the expanded
National Portrait Gallery, the revamped central courtyard of the
British Museum, and the huge 18th-century Somerset House.
</P>
<P>
   ''The contemporary art explosion stems from the crossover
between pop and rock music, videos and artists, the power of the
advertising agent and collector Charles Saatchi and the publicity
for new art forms by Nicholas Serota, director of the two Tates in
London and others in St. Ives and Liverpool,'' Waddell says.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of many things done by Damien Hirst, who also owns
restaurants, was to make rock videos for musicians, notably Blur,
and the millions of youngsters who saw them became interested in
what else Hirst and his friends were doing,'' she adds.
</P>
<P>
   ''Saatchi collects avant-garde artists' work and was behind the
Royal Academy's 'Sensation' exhibition, which then went to the
United States and had all that publicity when the mayor of New York
tried to ban it from Brooklyn. Everything comes together these
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the boom and millions of dollars made by artists such as
Hirst, Waddell noted that it's still hard for most artists to
scratch out a living.
</P>
<P>
   Waddell produced her first London art guide in 1979, offering
new editions every two-and-a-half years and spinoffs covering
similar ground for New York, Paris, Amsterdam, Berlin, Madrid,
Australia, Britain and Glasgow, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   This year, she also published ''The London Art World 1979-99,''
a book of her black-and-white photographs of the art scene, which
she hopes will become a document of the changes -- from clutter to
minimalism, from abstraction to figuration to conceptualism.
</P>
<P>
   But she has a wary word for one aspect of the boom scene.
</P>
<P>
   ''The opportunities for artists to exhibit and reach a wider
public are greater than they've ever been,'' she says. ''But
sometimes the hype of young artists is ridiculous and ignores some
exceptionally talented mid-career and older artists who were in
their 20s in the 1950s to 1970s.''

<HEADLINE> Bruce Hornsby Glad To Be on the Bus  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN ROGERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The tale he's about to impart, Bruce Hornsby
says impishly, is the tale of two roads: the one taken and the one
not taken.
</P>
<P>
   One led to fame, hotel rooms and a lifetime of buses that have
transported him from one concert venue to the next. Along the way
he has played his piano and sung ''The Way It Is,'' ''Mandolin
Rain'' and, yes, ''The Road not Taken'' to millions of people.
</P>
<P>
   The other is the one that would have put him behind the wheel of
a bus, driving basketball players from one end of Virginia to the
other.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he was a pretty fair basketball player back in high school,
Hornsby says.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had a couple of small school offers. Division II schools,''
he says, then bites back into the corn on the cob he's been trying
to finish amid a constant stream of greetings from admirers
backstage at the Universal Amphitheatre.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I wanted to play piano,'' he adds, looking up with a
sheepish grin.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he acknowledges, he was conflicted.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never regretted it,'' he adds quickly. ''If I'd taken one
of the offers, I'm sure I'd be a JV basketball coach somewhere in
Virginia by now.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he laughs at the vision.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd be the guy driving the JV team around and teaching
health.''
</P>
<P>
   But if he dodged that bullet, he still couldn't shake life on
the road.
</P>
<P>
   ''This isn't bad,'' he says, biting back into his corn. ''You
should have seen what we had last night.'' That was in San Diego.
Tonight is Los Angeles. Tomorrow will be somewhere in the San
Francisco Bay area.
</P>
<P>
   The peripatetic Hornsby is back on the road with The Other Ones,
the remnants of the Grateful Dead (Bill Kreutzmann, Mickey Hart and
Bob Weir) minus the late Jerry Garcia. It's the group he last
toured with when it last toured, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the year, he'll be back in the studio recording a new
album with his own band; the first new material he's worked on
since 1998's ''Spirit Trail.'' He's also working with Ricky Skaggs
on a tribute album to Bill Monroe, the father of bluegrass music.
</P>
<P>
   And he'll be trying, whenever he can squeeze in the dates, to
promote ''Here Come the Noise Makers,'' a live album with songs
culled from a catalog dating to the mid-1980s, when he won the
Grammy for best new artist of 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll be playing with a symphony orchestra, the Roanoke
Symphony, in October,'' he says proudly.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hornsby has never been able to shake The Other Ones
completely.
</P>
<P>
   One of his first gigs was playing in a Grateful Dead cover band
that his older brother Bob threw together.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were Bobby High Test and the Octane Kids,'' he recalls with
a laugh. ''I was Little Brother Brucie on the piano. That was in
1974. I was a freshman in college.''
</P>
<P>
   By the late '80s, Bruce Hornsby and the Range were opening shows
for the Dead, a one-time cult attraction that had grown to the
status of arena favorite. When Brent Mydland, the group's keyboard
player, died of a drug overdose in 1990, the Dead tapped Hornsby to
fill in until a permanent replacement could be found.
</P>
<P>
   ''I already knew about 30 songs,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The Dead performed more than 100 songs, often going a week or
more without repeating itself.
</P>
<P>
   ''They made me learn 160 songs,'' he says in a voice that still
betrays incredulity.
</P>
<P>
   He stayed on for nearly two years, long after permanent
replacement Vince Welnick had arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess I figured after all that, I ought to get some use out
of it,'' he says of his new repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   Hornsby never completely left. He joined the band impromptu here
and there throughout the '90s. Then he signed on for many of the
Furthur Festival shows that the reconstituted and constantly
evolving Others Ones put together.
</P>
<P>
   With Garcia gone, Hornsby, 45, has stepped up front more,
singing lead on some of Garcia's most popular songs and sometimes
playing piano where a Garcia guitar riff would have been a given.
If the constant stream of people stopping to chat over dinner at
the amphitheater is any indication, the group's notoriously
parochial fans wouldn't have it any other way.
</P>
<P>
   ''L.A.,'' he says, shaking his head with good-natured
exasperation.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we were in Seattle,'' he adds, ''we could talk as long as
we wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps in Williamsburg, Va., the small, bucolic town where
he has lived for the past 10 years. He grew up in Williamsburg. His
father once served on the City Council. He's raising his twin
8-year-old sons there now.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Colonial town,'' he says proudly.
</P>
<P>
   Then, turning mischievous again, he smiles and asks: ''You ever
go there on a school field trip and have the locals throw bottles
at you?
</P>
<P>
   ''That would have been me,'' he adds. ''I was one of those.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Falls 76; Nasdaq Drops 12  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Continued nervousness about third-quarter
earnings pushed stocks lower Wednesday, despite the announcement of
a merger between two of the country's largest banks.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average fell 76.21 to 11,157.02.
</P>
<P>
   Broader indicators also declined. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index fell 4.77 to 1,477.22, and the Nasdaq composite index was
down 11.68 at 3,837.83.
</P>
<P>
   Although most third-quarter earnings reports won't come out
until next month, concerns that the numbers will be disappointing
have sent stocks in September. The market has fallen into a pattern
of rewarding companies that deliver strong profits and outlooks,
and punishing those who don't.
</P>
<P>
   SCI Systems was off $12.19 at $43.75, a nearly 22 percent
decline, after the electronics manufacturer said its quarterly
results would fall below expectations because of seasonal weakness
in demand for its products.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Sherwin Williams dropped $2.63 to $21.25 after the
paint company said quarterly earnings would not meet Wall Street
expectations because of higher raw material costs and tough
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Intel fell $3.25 to $61.69 after a Banc of America Securities
analyst cut his rating to ''market perform'' from ''strong buy.''
Last week, a U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffries analyst to ''buy'' from
''strong buy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're still half a month away from actual earnings season, but
we've already had key reports from companies like DuPont saying it
will be down. The market has not taken that news well,'' said Ricky
Harrington, a senior vice president at Wachovia Securities in
Charlotte, N.C. ''It's somewhat subjective, but I think the runup
of stocks that we saw before Labor Day has set the stage for
downside surprises.''
</P>
<P>
   DuPont shares fell sharply last week after the chemical company
said its earnings would be below expectations because of rising
costs and soft markets.
</P>
<P>
   Before the market opened, Chase Manhattan Bank announced it was
acquiring J.P. Morgan for about $36 billion in stock. J.P. Morgan
traded down $7.50 at $177.94, after weeks of its stock price
inching upward on rumors that it was an acquisition target. Chase
Manhattan fell $2.63 to $49.88.
</P>
<P>
   The merger news, which might be expected to lift stocks, was
instead overshadowed by the earnings uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a narrow margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 487.99 million
shares, compared with 457.83 million in the last session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index fell 1.27 to 531.16.

<HEADLINE> China Trade Bill Being Sorted Out  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate on Wednesday neared a vote on
sanctioning Chinese weapons proliferation, settling a squabble that
was holding up what was expected to be a strong Senate vote to
endorse permanent normal trade status for China.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the most important trade bill of this Congress was
within sight, but the Senate first had to dispose of the
proliferation issue and at least a dozen other amendments.
</P>
<P>
   A vote on the proliferation amendment was set Wednesday
afternoon, ending an impasse that had postponed that vote and
delayed completion of the trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment's chief sponsor, Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., said
it was important to focus on the issue because the threat of
Chinese arms technology sales is ''not diminishing its growing. ...
The leadership of the Chinese government is basically giving us the
back of their hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The House in May passed the bill that ends the annual review of
U.S.-Chinese trade relations and grants China permanent trade
status in conjunction with that country's impending entry into the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   To join the WTO, China has agreed to significantly lower its
tariffs and remove trade barriers, actions that could mean billions
of dollars in increased business for American companies.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to pass. It's time now we get to the closing,''
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Lott's effort Tuesday to schedule a vote on Thompson's
amendment was thwarted by fellow Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The Banking Committee chairman, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, and
Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo, a senior member of that committee, argued
that they should have more input in shaping the proliferations
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who chairs the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee,
shot back that ''this is the only amendment that deals with a
direct threat to this nation and we are talking about process.''
</P>
<P>
   His proposal, co-sponsored by Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.,
would set up an annual review of the weapons sales of China, Russia
and North Korea and require the president to impose
non-trade-related sanctions on individuals and companies that
violate nonproliferation agreements. The president also could
impose additional sanctions on key supplier nations.
</P>
<P>
   It also requires the Securities and Exchange Commission to
create a procedure to inform American investors when foreign
entities on the president's proliferation list invest in U.S.
capital markets.
</P>
<P>
   The president would be able to waive the sanctions requirements
for national security reasons, but Congress could vote to override
that waiver.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson acknowledged that he faced formidable foes in pushing
his measure. ''There's a powerful combination of forces out there --
the White House and the Chamber of Commerce -- working very hard
against this.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Tom Donohue, before leaving
for a weeklong trade mission to Asia, spent Tuesday morning on
Capitol Hill, buttonholing senators in a last-minute effort to
ensure passage of a clean China trade bill. ''Should this vote get
tangled up to the extent that it might not be passed, that would
have a very serious political implication,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the bill, led by business and agriculture groups,
argue that it must clear the Senate without amendments so that it
doesn't have to be sent back to the House for further consideration
in the final days before this Congress adjourns.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday easily defeated three proposed amendments
linking the new trade relationship to such issues as China's ending
its subsidies to state-run enterprises, ending the export of
prison-made goods and improving its human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 4444.

<HEADLINE> Lieberman: Media Promotes Carnage  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Joe Lieberman decried a ''culture of
carnage'' surrounding America's young people and told a Senate
committee Wednesday that the government should stop the marketing
of violent movies, music and video games to children if the
industry fails to police itself.
</P>
<P>
   Parents feel ''locked in a losing competition with the culture
to raise our children,'' said Lieberman, a longtime opponent of
violence and sex in the media who helped bring the issue into the
presidential campaign as Democratic nominee Al Gore's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing followed a scathing Federal Trade Commission report
this week that asserted the entertainment industry was peddling
adult material to underage audiences. Federal media regulators have
announced they'll take a closer look at the amount of sex and
violence on the major TV networks.
</P>
<P>
   Senators used the hearing to accuse entertainment executives and
to criticize them for failing to show up to defend themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their hubris is stunning,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
head of the Commerce Committee, who convened the hearing. ''I have
never seen such a thing before.''
</P>
<P>
   He called another hearing in two weeks specifically to hear from
the heads of Time Warner, Walt Disney Co., Newscorp, Viacom,
Miramax and others.
</P>
<P>
   Both presidential campaigns were represented at the hearing,
seizing on an issue that resonates strongly with Americans
concerned about the exposure of young adults to sex and violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''This practice is outrageous, it is deceptive and it has got to
stop,'' said Lieberman, the Democratic vice presidential nominee.
He reiterated a pledge by the Gore campaign to crack down on the
industry if it doesn't shape up in six months.
</P>
<P>
   His Republican opponent, George W. Bush, questioned Gore's
credibility on the issue and said the solution should rest with
parents and political persuasion, not new federal regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Lynne Cheney, wife of Republican vice presidential nominee Dick
Cheney and former head of the National Endowment for the
Humanities, espoused many of the same views as Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   But she took a swipe at the Democratic presidential duo, asking
them to deliver her message of accountability when they attend a
fund-raiser Thursday with Harvey Weinstein, chairman of Miramax
films.
</P>
<P>
   She also launched a full assault on rap star Eminem, whose
album, ''The Marshall Mathers LP,'' is one of the hottest -- and
most awarded -- in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''They could not be more despicable. They could not be more
hateful,'' she said of the lyrics to Eminem's song ''Kill You,''
which describes the artist raping and killing his mother.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC report decried the entertainment industry's ''pervasive
and aggressive marketing'' of adult material -- such as R-rated
movies or video games intended for mature audiences -- to children.
</P>
<P>
   The fallout from the study was felt Tuesday in Hollywood, as the
Walt Disney Co. announced changes in its marketing practices,
including a prohibition against theater owners showing trailers for
R-rated films before movies released under the Walt Disney label.
The Disney-owned ABC network also will not accept advertisements
for R-rated films during prime time before 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Disney said it would not show R-rated films -- released under its
Touchstone, Hollywood Pictures and Miramax Films labels -- to focus
groups under age 17 and would urge theater owners to more strictly
enforce the age restriction. The company does not release R-rated
films under the Walt Disney label.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Valenti, head of the Motion Picture Association of America,
acknowledged it was not suitable to target R-rated films to very
young children, but asserted that the FTC's report was based on
subjective judgments.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the commission determined that R-rated movies were
advertised on TV programs most popular with the under-17 group.
But, Valenti said, for many of these shows, the majority of the
audience is 18 and over.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not dealing with Euclid's geometry where the equations
are pristine and explicit,'' he said in remarks prepared for
delivery at Wednesday's hearing. Still, he promised that the
industry would examine how it advertises and conducts research so
that it does not deliberately target underage viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission extended the sphere of
scrutiny to the airwaves by announcing Tuesday it would examine
whether broadcasters were promoting inappropriate programming when
children were likely to be watching.

<HEADLINE> Review: Chemical Weapons Checks OK  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some U.S. industry fears over chemical weapons
inspections have so far been unfounded, a congressional
investigator said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The first seven companies to be inspected under the 1997
convention requiring destruction of chemical weapons have not
suffered a feared loss of trade secrets nor from bad publicity,
Jack L. Brock Jr. of the General Accounting Office told a House
panel.
</P>
<P>
	   The GAO was asked to review the experiences of companies under
the chemical weapons convention as a way to anticipate problems
that drug, agricultural, chemical and brewing companies might have
with another international agreement -- one still being negotiated
to cover biological weapons. On that, he said he couldn't make
definite conclusions.
</P>
<P>
	   ''I would like to caution that our ability to draw conclusions
... is somewhat limited,'' Brock said, because requirements for
judging compliance on biological weapons could be different for
those on chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   Brock was testifying at the House Government Reform Committee's
subcommittee on National Security, Veterans Affairs and
International Relations. The committee was looking into the
questions of whether it is possible to verify nations have stopped
producing biological weapons and are destroying old stocks -- and
whether in attempting to verify such things U.S. industry and
defense secrets might be compromised.
</P>
<P>
	   Susan Koch, deputy assistant secretary of defense, told the
committee that the Pentagon does not believe that the system being
negotiated -- the protocol for judging compliance on biological
weapons -- will work.
</P>
<P>
	   ''We do not believe that the protocol being negotiated will be
able to provide the kind of effective verification that exists in
other arms control treaties,'' she said.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some U.S. industry fears over chemical weapons
inspections have so far been unfounded, a congressional
investigator said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The first seven companies to be inspected under the 1997
convention requiring destruction of chemical weapons have not
suffered a feared loss of trade secrets nor from bad publicity,
Jack L. Brock Jr. of the General Accounting Office told a House
panel.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO was asked to review the experiences of companies under
the chemical weapons convention as a way to anticipate problems
that drug, agricultural, chemical and brewing companies might have
with another international agreement -- one still being negotiated
to cover biological weapons. On that, he said he couldn't make
definite conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like to caution that our ability to draw conclusions
... is somewhat limited,'' Brock said, because requirements for
judging compliance on biological weapons could be different for
those on chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Brock was testifying at the House Government Reform Committee's
subcommittee on National Security, Veterans Affairs and
International Relations. The committee was looking into the
questions of whether it is possible to verify nations have stopped
producing biological weapons and are destroying old stocks -- and
whether in attempting to verify such things U.S. industry and
defense secrets might be compromised.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Koch, deputy assistant secretary of defense, told the
committee that the Pentagon does not believe that the system being
negotiated -- the protocol for judging compliance on biological
weapons -- will work.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not believe that the protocol being negotiated will be
able to provide the kind of effective verification that exists in
other arms control treaties,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Committee chairman Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., criticized
representatives of the pharmaceutical industry for refusing to
attend the hearing -- saying the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America ''has not been shy'' about lobbying the
government for the best treatment possible on the issue.

<HEADLINE> Author's Wife Threatens Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- The widow of journalist Edgar Snow, who
chronicled the Chinese Communist Party's early years as a guerrilla
army, has threatened to sue over a film about her husband's
friendship with Mao Tse-tung.
</P>
<P>
   Lois Wheeler Snow says the upcoming film, made by a Chinese
state studio, draws without permission on Edgar Snow's landmark
book, ''Red Star Over China,'' and her own account of his final
days.
</P>
<P>
   She accused China of hypocrisy, saying it praised her late
husband as a seeker of truth while curtailing a free Chinese press.
In modern China, it would be impossible to make a ''truthful,
independent film about my husband,'' she wrote in a letter to the
film's Chinese makers.
</P>
<P>
   Snow, who died in Switzerland in 1972, is officially regarded as
a ''friend of China,'' for his sympathetic coverage of the
communist struggle in the 1930s and 1940s. But his widow clashed
with the government this year when police in Beijing blocked her
from visiting the mother of a victim of the 1989 crackdown on
pro-democracy protesters.
</P>
<P>
   ''We strongly object to Edgar Snow's life story being used for
propaganda purposes,'' Wheeler Snow wrote. The letter said the
producers had no right to make or show the film without her
permission, and could face ''legal or other appropriate action.''
</P>
<P>
   Snow wrote ''Red Star Over China'' after living with Mao's
struggling communist guerrillas in their remote base in the hills
of northwestern China in 1936. It drew international attention to
the movement, which finally came to power in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Director Song Jiangbo denied his movie violated any copyrights,
saying screenwriter Li Chao relied on interviews and historical
works, not Snow's book.
</P>
<P>
   The lives of Mao and Snow are part of the public record, said
Song, who works for the Changchun Film Studio in the northeastern
province of Jilin, one of a trio of Chinese studios financing the
movie.
</P>
<P>
   ''She clearly hasn't read the script or seen the movie and isn't
familiar with the content. If she brings the lawsuit, we'll fight
her to the end,'' Song said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler Snow also complained that the Chinese movie crew
illegally entered the grounds of her house in Switzerland to film.
</P>
<P>
   Song responded that the crew had been shooting test footage and
stopped when asked by Snow's son.
</P>
<P>
   Song said he had planned to return to talk to Wheeler Snow, but
the Chinese Embassy in Switzerland objected because of her sympathy
toward the pro-democracy movement. China's army killed hundreds and
possibly thousands of people when it crushed pro-democracy protests
in Beijing on June 4, 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ''They said we shouldn't see her to avoid being misunderstood,''
Song said.
</P>
<P>
   Song said the film was not shot on instructions from the
government and said that it delved into the disagreements between
Snow and Mao, as well as their friendship.
</P>
<P>
   The movie stars John A. Gardner, an American businessman in Hong
Kong and first-time actor, as Snow. Song said it would be released
in China next spring.

<HEADLINE> Lieberman Sees 'Culture of Carnage'  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Joe Lieberman decried a ''culture of
carnage'' surrounding America's young people and told a Senate
committee Wednesday that the government should stop the marketing
of violent movies, music and video games to children if the
industry fails to police itself.
</P>
<P>
   Parents feel ''locked in a losing competition with the culture
to raise our children,'' said Lieberman, a longtime opponent of
violence and sex in the media who helped bring the issue into the
presidential campaign as Democratic nominee Al Gore's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing followed a scathing Federal Trade Commission report
this week that asserted the entertainment industry was peddling
adult material to underage audiences. Federal media regulators have
announced they'll take a closer look at the amount of sex and
violence on the major TV networks.
</P>
<P>
   Senators used the hearing to accuse entertainment executives and
to criticize them for failing to show up to defend themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their hubris is stunning,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
head of the Commerce Committee, who convened the hearing. ''I have
never seen such a thing before.''
</P>
<P>
   He called another hearing in two weeks specifically to hear from
the heads of Time Warner, Walt Disney Co., Newscorp, Viacom,
Miramax and others.
</P>
<P>
   Both presidential campaigns were represented at the hearing,
seizing on an issue that resonates strongly with Americans
concerned about the exposure of young adults to sex and violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''This practice is outrageous, it is deceptive and it has got to
stop,'' said Lieberman, the Democratic vice presidential nominee.
He reiterated a pledge by the Gore campaign to crack down on the
industry if it doesn't shape up in six months.
</P>
<P>
   His Republican opponent, George W. Bush, questioned Gore's
credibility on the issue and said the solution should rest with
parents and political persuasion, not new federal regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Lynne Cheney, wife of Republican vice presidential nominee Dick
Cheney and former head of the National Endowment for the
Humanities, espoused many of the same views as Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   But she took a swipe at the Democratic presidential duo, asking
them to deliver her message of accountability when they attend a
fund-raiser Thursday with Harvey Weinstein, chairman of Miramax
Films.
</P>
<P>
   She also launched a full assault on rap star Eminem, whose
album, ''The Marshall Mathers LP,'' is one of the hottest -- and
most awarded -- in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''They could not be more despicable. They could not be more
hateful,'' she said of the lyrics to Eminem's song ''Kill You,''
which describes the artist raping and killing his mother.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC report decried the entertainment industry's ''pervasive
and aggressive marketing'' of adult material -- such as R-rated
movies or video games intended for mature audiences -- to children.
</P>
<P>
   Music distributors and video game makers said they have worked
hard to implement voluntary ratings to inform parents of content.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is nothing wrong with considering and perhaps adopting a
more robust system'' for rating music, said Strauss Zelnick,
president and chief executive officer of BMG Entertainment. But, he
added, ''I don't think you can analyze a work of art like you can
analyze a breakfast cereal.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Peter Moore, chief operating officer of video game giant
Sega of America: ''We are open to suggestions, but suggestions
based on reality, not speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   The fallout from the study was felt Tuesday in Hollywood, as the
Walt Disney Co. announced a prohibition against theater owners
showing trailers for R-rated films before movies released under the
Walt Disney label. The Disney-owned ABC network also will not
accept advertisements for R-rated films during prime time before 9
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Disney said it would not show R-rated films -- released under its
Touchstone, Hollywood Pictures and Miramax Films labels -- to focus
groups under age 17 and would urge theater owners to more strictly
enforce the age restriction.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Valenti, head of the Motion Picture Association of America,
acknowledged it was not suitable to target R-rated films to very
young children, but asserted that the FTC's report was based on
subjective judgments.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the commission determined that R-rated movies were
advertised on TV programs most popular with the under-17 group.
But, Valenti said, for many of these shows, the majority of the
audience is 18 and over.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not dealing with Euclid's geometry where the equations
are pristine and explicit,'' he said in remarks prepared for
delivery at Wednesday's hearing. Still, he promised that the
industry would examine how it advertises and conducts research so
that it does not deliberately target underage viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission extended the sphere of
scrutiny to the airwaves by announcing Tuesday it would examine
whether broadcasters were promoting inappropriate programming when
children were likely to be watching.

<HEADLINE> 'Survivor' Hatch's Book Deal Dead  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Millionaire ''Survivor'' Richard Hatch has been
voted off the book list. Hatch's lucrative deal with St. Martin's
Press has collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not doing the book,'' St. Martin's spokesman John
Murphy said in Wednesday's edition of the New York Post.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of its exclusive deals with Hatch and his 15 fellow
''Survivor'' castaways, CBS has veto power over how they can trade
on their participation in the hit adventure-game series.
</P>
<P>
   And the network already had a book in the works -- the official
account, ''Survivor,'' written by the series' executive producer
Mark Burnett with Martin Dugard, arrived in book stores this week.
</P>
<P>
   CBS spokesman Chris Ender said, ''Rich was very clear to us from
the very beginning: He wanted to write about his life, not the
'Survivor' experience.'' He got CBS' go-ahead.
</P>
<P>
   But the Web site Inside.com reported Wednesday that a different
proposal for ''Survival Skills for Life: An Owner's Manual'' was
submitted to publishers than the one CBS approved. According to
Inside.com, St. Martin's agreed to pay nearly $500,000 for a
''Survivor'' tell-all -- which Hatch wasn't authorized to write.
</P>
<P>
   A St. Martin's spokesman wasn't immediately available for
comment.

<HEADLINE> House Vote Keeps Boy Scouts' Charter  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House came down solidly behind the Boy
Scouts Wednesday with a 362-12 vote against a proposal to revoke
their eight-decade-old federal charter because of the scouting
organization's policy of excluding gays.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, who brought the legislation to the House floor to
show the lack for support for critics of the Scouts, labeled it an
attack on American values.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Cass Ballenger, R-N.C., said half the members of the House
were former Scouts and would defend an organization ''as American
as apple pie and baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   While the bill's opponents accused its few Democratic supporters
of extremism, Democrats complained that the GOP's only intent was
to embarrass them. Fifty Democrats and one Republican voted
''present'' in apparent protest of the procedure. One Republican,
Rep. James Greenwood of Pennsylvania, voted for the bill.
</P>
<P>
   David Smith of the Human Rights Campaign, a leading gay rights
organization, said Republicans were ''trying to change the subject
from hate crimes to Boy Scouts.'' The GOP leadership is resisting
Democratic attempts to pass hate crimes legislation this year.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the politics, the legislation offered by Rep. Lynn
Woolsey, D-Calif., spotlighted the uneasy relationship between the
federal government and the Boy Scouts since the organization's
stance toward gays became a national issue.
</P>
<P>
   Woolsey said she was a Girl Scout and one of her sons was a Boy
Scout. ''We're not saying the Boy Scouts are bad; we're saying that
intolerance is bad.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I know the value of scouting, and that's why I believe
scouting should be available to all boys, not just to some boys,''
Woolsey said during Tuesday night's debate. She was the only
Democrat to speak in favor of the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, a long line of Republicans rose to condemn the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an attack on the fundamental values of America,'' said
Rep. Chris Cannon, R-Utah, led by ''a small group of extremists on
the minority side.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., top Democrat on the Judiciary
Committee, said Republicans were engaging in a ''political stunt''
in bringing to the floor a bill that had had no hearings or
committee vote and didn't have a chance of passage.
</P>
<P>
   Woolsey said she wasn't told until Monday evening that
Republicans were taking up her legislation. It ''was a total
surprise to me.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're disappointed that this bill would even be considered,''
Boy Scouts spokesman Gregg Shields said. Having a federal charter
is an honor and ''we hope to continue to live up to that honor,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   The Boy Scouts got their federal charter in 1916, six years
after it was founded. It is one of about 90 groups with such
designation, an honorary title given to patriotic, charitable and
education organizations.
</P>
<P>
   While it confers no specific benefits, receiving a federal
charter is a mark of prestige and national recognition for a group.
Among other groups with federal charters are the American Legion,
Future Farmers of America, the National Tropical Botanical Garden
and the National Ski Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision in June, upheld the Boy
Scouts' ban on homosexuals serving as troop leaders. That ruling
may also give legal backing to the 6.2 million-member
organization's rejection of gay youths as members.
</P>
<P>
   The Scouts asserted that homosexual conduct is inconsistent with
the values it seeks to instill.
</P>
<P>
   Separately in June, President Clinton issued an executive order
barring discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in
federally conducted education and training programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Department in August asked the Justice Department
for guidance on how that order affected the holding of Boy Scout
Jamborees on federal lands.
</P>
<P>
   GOP presidential nominee George W. Bush and other Republicans
quickly accused the Clinton administration of trying to throw the
scouts off federal lands. But Attorney General Janet Reno, in a
statement this month, said the tradition of Boy Scouts using
federal lands for camping and other activities could continue.
</P>
<P>
   After the June Supreme Court ruling, Clinton said he is
''generally against discrimination against gays.'' But he refused
to criticize the Scouts or the court's ruling. ''The Boy Scouts
still are -- they're a great group. They do a lot of good.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill number is H.R. 4892.

<HEADLINE> Paltrow Sings, Dad Directs 'Duets'  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Gwyneth Paltrow has often sung with her mother,
actress Blythe Danner. Now she's singing for her father, Bruce
Paltrow, in his quirky karaoke road movie ''Duets.''
</P>
<P>
   In the film, which played at the Toronto International Film
Festival and opens Friday, Paltrow co-stars as a Vegas showgirl who
hits the highway with her long-lost dad, a karaoke hustler played
by pop singer Huey Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Paltrow has no formal voice training, but holds her own singing
a solo of ''Bette Davis Eyes'' and a duet with Lewis of Smokey
Robinson's ''Cruisin'.'' She also sings with Babyface on the
closing credits number, ''Just My Imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I always sang growing up. It was a very musical house. I was
always singing with my mother. I was always in singing groups in
school,'' Paltrow said.
</P>
<P>
   In the original script, her character did not sing, but her
father added it to the story.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wrote it in because I felt it was essential for the
character to sing,'' said Bruce Paltrow, who directed ''Duets'' and
was one of the producers. ''I thought it would be a way for her to
connect with her father. And I knew how well Gwyneth could sing.
When she and her mother sing together, you just can't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Paltrow and Lewis, ''Duets'' features two other
road-buddy pairings. Maria Bello plays a singer who pays her bills
with sexual favors and hooks up with a jilted cab driver (Scott
Speedman). Paul Giamatti plays a disillusioned salesman who becomes
entranced with the karaoke world and meets up with an ex-con (Andre
Braugher) who has an angelic voice.
</P>
<P>
   The characters travel from one singing bar to the next,
converging on a karaoke contest with a $5,000 prize in Omaha, Neb.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its lightweight premise, ''Duets'' has dark moments,
including some surprising violence.
</P>
<P>
   For all the karaoke trappings, the Paltrows said ''Duets'' was a
movie about connecting with family and friends, both fictionally
and in reality.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd never worked with Gwyneth,'' said Bruce Paltrow, whose
credits include producing and directing work on ''The White
Shadow'' and ''St. Elsewhere.'' ''It was something I'd wanted to
do, and I was jealous because she and Blythe had worked together
before.''
</P>
<P>
   His daughter, an Oscar winner for ''Shakespeare in Love,'' said
''Duets'' interested her as a fun, lighter role with the added
advantage of taking direction from her father.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he's the smartest person I've ever known in my life,''
she said. ''And also he's my Dad. I thought, maybe I'll work and
get spoiled at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Paltrow said she used her influence once to avoid an early
shooting call, when she would have needed to meet with the
hairdresser at 5 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''I asked the hairdresser, 'Do I really need to be in the first
shot?' and she said, 'Yeah, we asked, and you definitely have to be
in it.' So it's like, 'Da-a-addy, do I have to be in the first
shot?' And he's like, 'Nope.' It was great,'' Paltrow said,
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Both Paltrows visited karaoke bars to get a sense of the people
who sing at them. While they were shooting the movie around
Vancouver, Lewis even got up at a karaoke bar and sang some of his
own songs under his ''Duets'' character name, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Her first time in a karaoke bar, Paltrow said she thought,
''This is sort of stupid. Then you join in and get into the spirit
of it. It's so much fun. It's always the people who are the most
reluctant to do it who get up there and then they never put the
mike down.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Paltrow said he only tried his voice out once at a karaoke
bar.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think if you've jumped off a 60-foot tower and survived,
you've done it. You don't need to do it again,'' he said. ''I'm a
long way from Pavarotti. A long way.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Falls 57; Nasdaq Gains 30  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Continued nervousness about third-quarter
earnings left stocks mixed Wednesday despite the announcement of a
merger between two of the country's largest banks.
</P>
<P>
   In early afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average fell 56.60 to 11,176.63.
</P>
<P>
   Broader indicators moved higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
edged up 1.68 to 1,483.67 and the Nasdaq composite index rose 29.96
to 3,879.47, but the Russell 2000 index fell 0.49 to 531.94.
</P>
<P>
   Although most third-quarter earnings reports won't come out
until next month, concerns that the numbers will be disappointing
have sent stocks into divergent directions in September. The market
has fallen into a pattern of rewarding companies that deliver
strong profits and outlooks, and punishing those who don't.
</P>
<P>
   SCI Systems was off $9.313 at $46.625, a nearly 17 percent
decline, after the electronics manufacturer said its quarterly
results would fall below expectations because of seasonal weakness
in demand for its products.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Sherwin Williams dropped $2.25 to $21.625 after the
paint company said quarterly earnings would not meet Wall Street
expectations because of higher raw material costs and tough
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Intel fell $3.188 to $61.75 after a Banc of America Securities
analyst cut his rating to ''market perform'' from ''strong buy.''
Last week, a U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffries analyst to ''buy'' from
''strong buy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're still half a month away from actual earnings season, but
we've already had key reports from companies like DuPont saying it
will be down. The market has not taken that news well,'' said Ricky
Harrington, a senior vice president at Wachovia Securities in
Charlotte, N.C. ''It's somewhat subjective, but I think the runup
of stocks that we saw before Labor Day has set the stage for
downside surprises.''
</P>
<P>
   DuPont shares fell sharply last week after the chemical company
said its earnings would be below expectations because of rising
costs and soft markets.
</P>
<P>
   Before the market opened, Chase Manhattan Bank announced it was
acquiring J.P. Morgan for about $36 billion in stock. J.P. Morgan
traded down $6.75 at $178.75, after weeks of its stock price
inching upward on rumors that it was an acquisition target. Chase
Manhattan fell $2.875 to $49.938.
</P>
<P>
   The merger news, which might be expected to lift stocks, was
instead overshadowed by the earnings uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a narrow margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 697.96 million
shares, slightly up from Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index slipped 0.37 to 532.06.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate defeated a proposal Wednesday to
attach anti-weapons-sales sanctions to a bill permanently
normalizing trade relations with China, opening the path for
passage of the most important trade bill of this Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 65-32 against the weapons proliferation amendment,
with numerous senators saying they support the goals of tougher
monitoring of Chinese weapons sales but are concerned that linking
trade and weapons could doom passage of the trade bill this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''All senators agree that we must address China's record on
proliferation, but it is equally clear that this permanent trade
bill was never the right vehicle for that debate,'' said Sen. Max
Baucus, D-Mont.
</P>
<P>
   At least a dozen other amendments remained before the Senate
could finish work on the bill by next week, but none is likely to
pose a serious threat to the goal of an amendment-free bill.
</P>
<P>
   The proliferations vote came after the Republican leadership
broke an impasse that had postponed that vote and delayed
completion of the trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment's chief sponsor, Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., said
it was important to focus on the issue because the threat of
Chinese arms technology sales is ''not diminishing its growing. ...
The leadership of the Chinese government is basically giving us the
back of their hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The House in May passed the bill that ends the annual review of
U.S.-Chinese trade relations and grants China permanent trade
status in conjunction with that country's impending entry into the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   To join the WTO, China has agreed to significantly lower its
tariffs and remove trade barriers, actions that could mean billions
of dollars in increased business for American companies.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to pass. It's time now we get to the closing,''
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Lott's effort Tuesday to schedule a vote on Thompson's
amendment was thwarted by fellow Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The Banking Committee chairman, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, and
Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo, a senior member of that committee, argued
that they should have more input in shaping the proliferations
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who chairs the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee,
shot back that ''this is the only amendment that deals with a
direct threat to this nation and we are talking about process.''
</P>
<P>
   His proposal, co-sponsored by Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.,
would set up an annual review of the weapons sales of China, Russia
and North Korea and require the president to impose
non-trade-related sanctions on individuals and companies that
violate nonproliferation agreements. The president also could
impose additional sanctions on key supplier nations.
</P>
<P>
   It also requires the Securities and Exchange Commission to
create a procedure to inform American investors when foreign
entities on the president's proliferation list invest in U.S.
capital markets.
</P>
<P>
   The president would be able to waive the sanctions requirements
for national security reasons, but Congress could vote to override
that waiver.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson acknowledged that he faced formidable foes in pushing
his measure. ''There's a powerful combination of forces out there --
the White House and the Chamber of Commerce -- working very hard
against this.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Tom Donohue, before leaving
for a weeklong trade mission to Asia, spent Tuesday morning on
Capitol Hill, buttonholing senators in a last-minute effort to
ensure passage of a clean China trade bill. ''Should this vote get
tangled up to the extent that it might not be passed, that would
have a very serious political implication,'' he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Panel OKs Plan for Reagan Monument  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A plan to build a monument to former President
Ronald Reagan on the National Mall between the Capitol and the
Lincoln Memorial was approved Wednesday by the House Resources
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, proposed by Chairman Don Young, R-Alaska, was given
the go-ahead by voice vote. The bill now goes to the full House.
</P>
<P>
   It sets up a three-member Ronald Reagan Memorial Commission that
would consist of the chairman of the National Capital Memorial
Commission, who is appointed by the president, plus appointees of
the House speaker and the Senate majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, Congress would approve a precise location for
the monument and a marker at least three feet square would be set
up that designates it as the ''Future Site of the Ronald Reagan
Memorial.'' The secretary of the Interior would be required to
maintain that marker until the monument is built, dedicated and
opened to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The new commission would raise private funds to design, build
and maintain the monument.
</P>
<P>
   The National Capital Memorial Commission rejected the idea
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman John G. Parsons, representing the National Park
Service, said it would contradict the 14-year-old Commemorative
Works Act, which says no memorial to an individual should be
approved until 25 years after the person's death. Reagan is 89.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the commission and two others -- the Fine Arts
Commission and the National Capital Planning Commission -- agreed to
disapprove any new monument on the Mall. That accord would be
overridden if Young's bill becomes law and Congress approves a
site.

<HEADLINE> First Latin Grammy Awards Tonight  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Seven months after winning a Grammy for
record of the year, Carlos Santana had a chance at the same award
for a different song at the inaugural Latin Grammy Awards on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Santana's duet with the Mexican rock band Mana, ''Corazon
Espinado,'' competed with songs by Marc Anthony, Ricky Martin,
Ruben Blades and Carlos Vives for the honor. Among Santana's eight
Grammys in February was record of the year for ''Smooth.''
</P>
<P>
   Producer and songwriter Emilio Estefan led with six Latin Grammy
nominations. His wife, Gloria, was to be host of the CBS telecast
from the Staples Center, along with Jennifer Lopez, Andy Garcia and
Jimmy Smits.
</P>
<P>
   Heartthrob Anthony and Colombian recording star Shakira had five
nominations apiece.
</P>
<P>
   The Latin Grammys were started by an offshoot of the National
Academy of Recording Arts &AMP; Sciences, which produces the Grammys,
to capitalize on a growing interest in Latin music. The telecast
was to be seen in more than 120 countries.
</P>
<P>
   With a broad definition of Latin music -- anything sung in either
Spanish or Portuguese -- the first nominations caused some
controversy. The record company Fonovisa threatened a boycott,
complaining that the Latin Grammys slighted Mexican styles such as
norteno, tejano and ranchera.
</P>
<P>
   There also was some grumbling that television producers were
favoring artists who sing in English and are better known among
Americans. Martin, Christina Aguilera and 'N Sync were scheduled to
perform.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a first step, but it's a big step in the right
direction,'' said Francisco Villanueva, managing director of the
record label, BMG U.S. Latin.
</P>
<P>
   The 2,600 members of the Latin Academy of Recording Arts &AMP;
Sciences were eligible to vote in the 40 award categories.

<HEADLINE> Weaker Siamese Twin Growing Faster  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BARR
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Doctors caring for infant Siamese twins believe
the weaker one may be thriving at the expense of her better
developed sister, attorneys told an appeals court panel Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The three appeal judges must decide whether to permit the
separation of the Siamese twins, in effect condemning one to die.
</P>
<P>
   The parents, who are Roman Catholics from an unidentified
Eastern European country, oppose the operation and have appealed a
lower court's decision in favor of surgery. They say they wish to
let God's will take its course.
</P>
<P>
   The twins, joined at the lower abdomen, were born Aug. 8 at St.
Mary's Hospital in Manchester. Doctors said their condition
Wednesday was ''reasonably stable.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say both twins will die within six months if they are
not separated, but that one twin -- identified as Jodie -- could
survive on her own. The less-developed twin, Mary, could not
survive separation, doctors say.
</P>
<P>
   However, Mary recently has been growing faster than her sister,
said Adrian Whitfield, a barrister representing the doctors and the
Central Manchester Healthcare Trust.
</P>
<P>
   ''From the physical point of view, Jodie is not growing,
although she is eating well. The surgeon thinks it may be that Mary
is drawing nutrition from Jodie and growing at her expense,''
Whitfield said.
</P>
<P>
   This could influence the timing of surgery to separate the
twins, but there was no immediate crisis, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The justices decided Wednesday they would accept written
submissions from the Pro-Life Group and the Roman Catholic
Archbishop Cormac Murphy-O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy-O'Connor, leader of Catholics in England and Wales,
publicly supported the parents in a statement on Sept. 5.
</P>
<P>
   ''The parents in this case have made clear that they love both
their children equally, and cannot consent to one of them being
killed to help the other. I believe this moral instinct is right,''
Murphy-O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Surely it can only be acceptable for the court to override the
rights of parents when there is clear evidence that the parents are
not acting in the best interests of their children and wish them
harm.''
</P>
<P>
   The archbishop added that ''it would set a very dangerous
precedent to enshrine in English case law that it was ever lawful
to kill a person, that good may come of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lord Justice Alan Ward, one of three judges hearing the case,
said the court had contacted colleagues in Australia, South Africa
and Canada but had found no precedent to guide them
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no comparable authority in any of these jurisdictions
so far as they are all aware,'' Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Owen, a barrister appointed to represent Jodie's interest,
said Mary had no chance of long-term survival, and it was
''unreal'' to consider Mary's interests separately from those of
Jodie.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without Jodie, Mary will die. With Mary, Jodie will die,''
Owen said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The purpose of the operation is wholly to maintain life and
not to accelerate death by mercy killing or otherwise.''

<HEADLINE> N. Ireland's Leaders Visit U.S.  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The leaders of Northern Ireland's new
power-sharing government made a historic visit to the White House
on Wednesday and said they would continue working together to
bridge differences despite fresh violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ongoing violence reminds us of the need for all parties to
carry out their obligations under the accord and for those with
political aims to pursue them through exclusively peaceful means,''
President Clinton said in a statement after a 45-minute meeting
with David Trimble, leader of the main Protestant party, the Ulster
Unionists, and Seamus Mallon, a leader of the moderate Roman
Catholic Social Democratic and Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble and Mallon, on the first visit to the United States as
leaders of the Northern Irish Executive, updated the president on
the implementation of the Good Friday Accord. Clinton helped broker
the 1998 peace agreement that established a power-sharing
government with representatives of pro-British Northern Ireland
unionists and Sinn Fein, the mainly Roman Catholic party linked to
the outlawed Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although the institutions have only been fully operating for a
matter of weeks, elected representatives from across the party
spectrum are working together on issues -- from economic development
to the environment to health and education -- that hold the key to a
better life for their constituents, who now hold them accountable
under devolution of power,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest outbreak of violence, a mortar blast Wednesday
morning forced the evacuation of the main police station in the
Northern Ireland town of Armagh. No injuries were reported but
several people were treated for shock. Officials suspect such
incidents are linked to IRA dissidents opposed to the group's
cease-fire and its participation in Northern Ireland's peace
process.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some people still have to make up their minds about what we're
doing, about the agreement and about the future that we're trying
to bring about,'' Trimble said. ''Do they really actually want to
buy into the future or do they prefer to go back to the past -- the
violence and the associated racketeering and criminality that was
there as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Trimble and Mallon also invited Clinton to visit Northern
Ireland before the end of his presidency in January.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said he would if he could,'' Trimble said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I bet my life he'll come,'' Mallon said.
</P>
<P>
   The president has indicated a desire to make such a visit, but
no trip has been announced.

<HEADLINE> Italian Opera Fans Protest  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILAN, Italy (AP) -- It was the end of La Scala's long-standing
tradition: Angry opera fans showered pamphlets from the balconies
and marched in protest outside to denounce abolishment of the
house's venerable standing-room-only spots.
</P>
<P>
   La Scala on Wednesday stood by its decision to get rid of the
spots but offered one concession to the angry fans -- promising to
make 139 regular seats available at the old standing-room-only
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of opera fans walked in candlelight procession before
Tuesday night's performance of ''La Boheme.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first performance since the 222-year-old opera
house's summer break -- and the first since management announced it
was replacing the 160-200 standing spots with numbered seats.
</P>
<P>
   ''Back-row seats on the balconies are not the best for
visibility,'' La Scala spokesman Paolo Soraci conceded. ''But we
have to install them in line with Italian safety regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   La Scala cited fire-safety concerns.
</P>
<P>
   La Scala's standees -- traditionally regarded as among opera's
most ardent fans and most knowledgeable critics -- used to line up
for hours for the last-minute tickets at $5 to $9 a spot.
</P>
<P>
   Top tickets for opening night can run up to $1,500.

<HEADLINE> Putin Hints at 2001 Budget Changes  </HEADLINE>
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Signaling a possible rift within the government,
Russian President Vladimir Putin indicated Wednesday that the 2001
budget could be revised because many lawmakers want to spend more --
a proposal that his prime minister had flatly rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Gennady Seleznyov, the speaker of the State Duma, or lower house
of parliament, said that Putin suggested changes could be made
before the budget is debated Oct. 6 by lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president said he had ordered the government to meet with
(Duma) factions and committees to explain the budget concept
without brushing away their proposals,'' Seleznyov told reporters
after meeting with Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov had ruled out any changes before
the budget is taken up, saying the document was realistic. The
government has proposed a balanced budget for the first time since
Russia emerged from the 1991 Soviet breakup, with revenues and
spending both set at about $39 billion.
</P>
<P>
   If Putin were to order the government to revise the budget, it
could dent Kasyanov's authority. Russian news media speculate that
the prime minister may be dismissed because of his links with
prominent businessmen who had considerable clout under former
President Boris Yeltsin, but whom Putin has vowed to cut off.
</P>
<P>
   Kasyanov on Tuesday denied that he might resign or be dismissed,
saying negative media reports about him had been planted by
companies unhappy with some of his policies.
</P>
<P>
   Putin met with leaders of parliamentary factions Wednesday and
discussed the budget, leaders said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers across the spectrum have criticized the budget as
overly cautious. They say the government should raise its estimates
for industrial growth, inflation and oil prices. That would
increase revenue projections and permit more spending.
</P>
<P>
   The budget forecast assumes that the average price for oil --
Russia's main export -- would be about $21 per barrel. With prices
around $32 per barrel, many lawmakers think the government will get
more in taxes, and can therefore spend more.
</P>
<P>
   Many deputies have urged raising defense spending from $6.8
billion to $9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Zhukov, the head of the Duma's budget committee, said
Wednesday that revising budget assumptions would allow an increase
in spending by $8.3 billion to $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But Zhukov said that most of that additional amount should be
earmarked to service Russia's huge foreign debt, not defense or
social spending.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Moves Against Japanese Whaling  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration on Wednesday moved
to punish Japan for overly aggressive whaling, beginning a process
that could lead to economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Strong international cooperation has allowed the recovery of
many whale species once pushed to the brink of extinction,''
President Clinton said in a written statement. ''We must work to
ensure that these protections are upheld.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House complained that Japan violated international
whaling rules this summer by hunting two species protected under
U.S. law. Japan claims that it is hunting Bryde's and sperm whales
in the North Pacific for scientific purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Japan is killing whales in the name of scientific research to
satisfy a demand for whale meat in a few high-end restaurants and
gourmet boutiques,'' Commerce Secretary Norman Mineta said.
</P>
<P>
   Until July, Japan's research program was limited to minke
whales.
</P>
<P>
   Mineta said the United States and international conservation
bodies fear that Japan is trying to resume commercial whaling on a
scale banned since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton directed his Cabinet to investigate the practice and
list his options, including trade sanctions. Sanctions would likely
cover Japanese fishery products.
</P>
<P>
   The United States will also deny Japan access to some fishing
rights in U.S. waters.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not take these steps lightly,'' White House chief of
staff John Podesta said. ''We hope the Japanese government will
heed the protests of the international community and reverse its
actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Foley, the U.S. ambassador to Japan, said in Washington
he hoped the Japanese government ''would reconsider their action so
a decision restricting fishing rights can be avoided.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the United States has repeatedly raised the whaling
issue in high-level contacts with Japanese officials, most recently
last week when Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met Japanese
Foreign Minister Yohei Kono in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In Tokyo, the government's top spokesman said Japan will
retaliate if the United States imposes sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the U.S. does in fact impose sanctions on us unilaterally,
we would have to take action in line with international rules,''
Chief Cabinet Secretary Hidenao Nakagawa said.
</P>
<P>
   While Nakagawa did not elaborate, Japan's response could include
lodging a complaint with the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The International Whaling Commission banned commercial whaling
in the mid-1980s but allowed whaling countries to kill whales to
gather information on migration, eating patterns and pollution
levels. Japanese officials claim that there is no way to conduct
the research without killing whales.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Surinamese Minister Kills Self  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UTRECHT, Netherlands (AP) -- Jan Sariman, a former Surinamese
minister who fled to the Netherlands in 1983 as a political
refugee, committed suicide on the eve of his embezzlement trial, a
prosecution spokeswoman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sariman, who was in his early 50s, was minister for agriculture,
fisheries and animal husbandry in the former Dutch colony, located
in northeastern South America, before a Dec. 8, 1992 bloody purge
of opponents of former dictator Desi Bouterse, who took power in a
1980 military coup.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, Sariman fled to the Netherlands where he became active
in the immigrant Surinamese community, serving as treasurer of the
Foundation of Collaborating Ethnic Minorities in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   He was charged with misappropriating $132,000 from the
foundation in a trial that was scheduled to begin Tuesday at the
district court in this central Dutch city.
</P>
<P>
   But the trial was suspended moments after it opened Tuesday when
a court official announced Sariman had killed himself the previous
day, according to prosecution spokeswoman Marjolein Kisjes.
</P>
<P>
   No further details on Sariman's death or family circumstances
were known, she said.

<HEADLINE> Radical French Farmer Found Guilty  </HEADLINE>
By ELAINE GANLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILLAU, France (AP) -- A militant sheep farmer was sentenced
Wednesday to three months in prison for vandalizing a McDonald's
restaurant in a protest that made him a hero in the eyes of the
French in the battle against rampant globalization.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 supporters of Jose Bove chanted and banged sticks
outside the small courthouse in this town in southern France. But
it was nothing like the raucous atmosphere of his June 30 trial
when he was carried to court in an ox cart amid cheering crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Bove and his lawyers appealed the verdict. The sentence exceeded
that sought by the prosecution during the two-day trial, which drew
15,000 people. The prosecution asked for 10 months with nine months
suspended.
</P>
<P>
   But presiding judge Francois Mallet said the stiffer sentence
aimed ''to make him (Bove) finally listen to reason.''
</P>
<P>
   The sprightly, mustachioed Bove, however, vowed prison would not
stop him from continuing his battle against multinationals and the
World Trade Organization, which he claims pose a threat to small
farmers, good food and a way of life.
</P>
<P>
   ''The court thinks this judgment is going to stop the battle,''
Bove said. ''But the fight is going on all over the world ...
against bad food.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight other defendants were given sentences ranging from $265
fines to two-month suspended prison terms. One was acquitted. The
McDonald's, located at the base of a hill where Bove lived in a
centuries-old farmhouse, was dismantled with farm equipment while
under construction on Aug. 12, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Bove has already spent three weeks in prison, meaning he will
likely serve two months in jail, his lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not afraid of prison,'' said Bove, dressed in jeans and
sandals. ''I know it and think I'd be welcomed by inmates and
guards.''
</P>
<P>
   Bove, nicknamed ''Robin Hood,'' has become a folk hero in France
since the attack, which he said was ultimately against the
''McDomination'' of the world. His $17,000 bail was paid for by
farmers and activists around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Bove said his Farmers' Confederation, linked with movements
elsewhere, would continue to act, in particular destroying fields
of genetically altered crops.
</P>
<P>
   Bove, who coined a new French term -- ''mal bouffe'' (bad eats) --
gained international stature defending small farmers against what
they see as the encroachment of multinationals producing
standardized, unhealthy food.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on McDonald's was inspired by U.S. sanctions on
European delicacies, from foie gras to Roquefort cheese -- some made
from milk supplied by Bove's flock. The sanctions were designed to
punish the European Union for refusing to import American
hormone-treated beef.

<HEADLINE> Immunity Proposed For Burmese Chiefs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Republican congressman proposed Wednesday
''some degree of immunity'' for military leaders of Myanmar to get
them to give up power.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Cooksey, R-La., who has visited the country also known
as Burma, said at a House subcommittee hearing that the government
of the Southeast Asian country has made some effort to stem the
flow of drugs, however.
</P>
<P>
   He said it is a country of good, smart people where ''the
dummies have the guns.'' The military regime is holding back
progress, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The House International Relations Committee's panel on Asia
approved a resolution marking the 10th anniversary of an election
in Myanmar won by Aung San Suu Kyi and her opposition party, which
was never allowed to take office. Under house arrest, she later won
the Nobel Peace Prize.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution calls for a restoration of democracy. It urges
freedom of speech, a government dialogue with Suu Kyi, and release
of detained parliamentary election winners.
</P>
<P>
   Cooksey said he had warned Myanmar's regime not to harm Suu Kyi,
saying, ''If it does, the wrath of the world is going to come down
on you and wipe you out.''
</P>
<P>
   An amendment to the resolution deleted an endorsement of U.S.
sanctions against Myanmar. Subcommittee chairman Rep. Doug
Bereuter, R-Neb., who introduced the amendment, said the sanctions
have been totally ineffective.

<HEADLINE> Holocaust Settlement Plan Detailed  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A court-appointed mediator says Swiss banks
should pay about $800 million of a historic $1.25 billion
settlement with Holocaust victims to those who deposited money to
hide it from the Nazis and never got it back.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining $450 million would go to wartime refugees who were
denied entrance to or were expelled from Switzerland, slave
laborers forced to work for companies with Swiss accounts, and
victims whose belongings were plundered by the Nazis and apparently
wound up in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   The allocation proposal was included in a voluminous draft plan
for dividing and distributing the settlement to Holocaust victims
and their heirs. It was made public Tuesday in Brooklyn federal
court by special master Judah Gribetz. A ''special master'' is a
person appointed by a court to conduct help research a particular
question.
</P>
<P>
   The plan gives priority to the so-called ''Deposited Assets
Class'' -- Jews and other victims with valid claims that the banks
failed to reimburse them after World War II. Gribetz estimates that
$800 million -- including interest -- will be needed to reimburse
bank account holders and heirs.
</P>
<P>
   Among other claimaints, the proposal estimates that each
surviving refugee would get $2,500 and laborers $1,000 apiece.
Their heirs would be largely excluded. ''There is simply not enough
money available,'' Gribetz cautioned in a letter to the millions of
potential claimants posted on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is consistent with Congress' decision to compensate
Japanese-Americans confined in detention camps in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs' attorney Morris Ratner said the proposal ''does not
satisfy all my concerns, but I think it is plainly fair.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan still must be approved by U.S. District Judge Edward
Korman. The judge will hold a public hearing on Nov. 20 before
making a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Gribetz -- a New York City attorney and former deputy mayor --
said his proposals rely heavily on the findings of a three-year,
independent investigation headed by Paul A. Volcker, the former
Federal Reserve chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The Volcker Committee identified 26,000 Swiss bank accounts
probably opened by Holocaust victims, and an additional 20,000
possibly connected. Gribetz recommended publishing account
information worldwide to find the claimants.
</P>
<P>
   ''The findings of the Volcker Committee must be acted upon,''
Gribetz wrote. ''They are not merely for history books.''
</P>
<P>
   Gribetz called for the Claims Resolution Tribunal -- a
Zurich-based body of judges, lawyers and accountants established by
the Volcker Committee and the Swiss banks -- to process the claims.
So far, about 560,000 people have expressed interest in making
claims; about 80,000 have identified themselves as Swiss bank
depositors.
</P>
<P>
   Korman approved the settlement in July after attorneys from both
sides convinced him that that an overwhelming majority of the
plaintiffs in the class-action lawsuit against the banks supported
it.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed by Holocaust victims who deposited money in
Swiss banks for safekeeping as the Nazis gained power in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, the plaintiffs said, they ran into a stone wall
in trying to claim the assets. In some cases, they lacked detailed
account information; some bankers even demanded
impossible-to-obtain death certificates of people killed in Nazi
concentration camps.

<HEADLINE> Russian Whistle Blower Acquitted  </HEADLINE>
By ANGELA CHARLTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- To the relief of environmental and human rights
activists, Russia's Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld the acquittal
of an ex-navy officer accused of espionage for revealing the perils
of decaying nuclear submarines.
</P>
<P>
   The decision finally closed a case that had drawn international
criticism as it dragged on for four years. Alexander Nikitin's
cause was championed by environmental and other activists who
accused the government of Soviet-style persecution.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today I am very happy,'' Nikitin told reporters after
Wednesday's court ruling. ''What happened is a triumph of law and
justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Nikitin was arrested in 1996 for preparing a report on decaying
nuclear warships for the Norwegian environmental group Bellona. The
report described 52 Cold War-era submarines in a remote shipyard
near Russia's border with Norway whose spent nuclear fuel could
have leaked or exploded.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's main intelligence agency, the Federal Security Service,
accused Nikitin of sharing secret information with foreigners and
he was jailed for nearly a year.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters in Russia and abroad denounced the case as an attempt
to intimidate environmental groups and set back freedom of speech.
</P>
<P>
   A St. Petersburg court acquitted Nikitin in December, throwing
out the espionage charges. The court ruled the information was not
classified as secret at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court upheld that ruling in April. But the
Prosecutor General's office appealed, saying further investigation
was needed. On Wednesday, the Presidium of the Supreme Court -- the
court's highest body -- rejected the prosecutor's appeal, closing
the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some people still remain in this country ... who are living in
the past,'' Nikitin said. ''And these people resisted until the
end. Today, a final line has been drawn.''
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International praised Wednesday's ruling, but warned
that it doesn't mean rights are secure in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are delighted that Alexander Nikitin's long ordeal is
finally at an end -- an ordeal he should never have had to undergo
in the first place,'' the executive director of Amnesty USA,
William F. Schulz, said in a statement. ''This decision should send
a strong signal to President (Vladimir) Putin to urgently address
the deteriorating human rights situation in Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin headed the Federal Security Service during much of the
Nikitin case, but made little comment publicly except to say
Nikitin was guilty. Putin has also said that ecological groups were
providing cover for foreign spies.
</P>
<P>
   But Putin has denied any crackdown on dissent, and some human
rights activists say things are no worse under him than they were
under Boris Yeltsin, who was president when Nikitin was arrested.

<HEADLINE> Errol Flynn's Island To Be Sold  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) -- An island once owned by the Hollywood
swashbuckler Errol Flynn is being sold by the Jamaican government.
</P>
<P>
   A company run by Jamaican and foreign investors will pay $2.75
million for lush, half-mile-long Navy Island, officials said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The sale includes a decaying resort that offers a nude beach and
snorkeling. The company said it will add restaurants, boutiques and
luxury villas.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the government said it planned to sell the island
to ''Officer and a Gentleman'' actor Louis Gossett Jr. for $3
million, but the deal fell through.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn died in 1959. The government acquired the island in 1997
from an auto dealer.

<HEADLINE> Dow Drops 72; Nasdaq Rises 39  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Continued nervousness about third-quarter
earnings left stocks mixed Wednesday despite the announcement of a
merger between two of the country's largest banks.
</P>
<P>
   In late afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average fell 71.68 to 11,161.55.
</P>
<P>
   Broader indicators moved higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
edged up 2.93 to 1,484.92 and the Nasdaq composite index rose 38.81
to 3,888.32.
</P>
<P>
   Although most third-quarter earnings reports won't come out
until next month, concerns that the numbers will be disappointing
have sent stocks into divergent directions in September. The market
has fallen into a pattern of rewarding companies that deliver
strong profits and outlooks, and punishing those who don't.
</P>
<P>
   SCI Systems was off $9.50 at $46.44, a nearly 17 percent
decline, after the electronics manufacturer said its quarterly
results would fall below expectations because of seasonal weakness
in demand for its products.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Sherwin Williams dropped $1.75 to $22.13 after the
paint company said quarterly earnings would not meet Wall Street
expectations because of higher raw material costs and tough
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Intel fell $4.19 to $60.75 after a Banc of America Securities
analyst cut his rating to ''market perform'' from ''strong buy.''
Last week, a U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffries analyst to ''buy'' from
''strong buy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're still half a month away from actual earnings season, but
we've already had key reports from companies like DuPont saying it
will be down. The market has not taken that news well,'' said Ricky
Harrington, a senior vice president at Wachovia Securities in
Charlotte, N.C. ''It's somewhat subjective, but I think the runup
of stocks that we saw before Labor Day has set the stage for
downside surprises.''
</P>
<P>
   DuPont shares fell sharply last week after the chemical company
said its earnings would be below expectations because of rising
costs and soft markets.
</P>
<P>
   Before the market opened, Chase Manhattan Bank announced it was
acquiring J.P. Morgan for about $36 billion in stock. J.P. Morgan
traded down $6.06 at $179.38, after weeks of its stock price
inching upward on rumors that it was an acquisition target. Chase
Manhattan fell $2.38 to $50.13.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is the third in the financial services industry in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Citigroup announced it was buying Associates First
Capital for $29.5 billion in stock and, on Tuesday, Goldman Sachs
said it would buy market maker Spear Leeds &AMP; Kellogg L.P. for $6.5
billion in stock and cash.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Knight Trading Group, a leading market maker, were up
$6.91 at $36.34, more than 23 percent, on speculation that it might
be next.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 6-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 838.31 million
shares, ahead of 775.21 million shares on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> EU Lifts Austria Sanctions  </HEADLINE>
By ROLAND PRINZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Hailing the lifting of European Union
diplomatic sanctions, Austria's right-wing firebrand Joerg Haider
on Wednesday labeled the measures a ''complete flop.''
</P>
<P>
   Haider, whose far right Freedom Party's inclusion in the
government led to the sanctions, said the measures failed in their
goal to force the party out of the ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Austria's 14 European Union partners lifted the seven-month
sanctions against Austria on Tuesday after a panel said the
measures stoked the nationalistic feeling they were meant to
punish.
</P>
<P>
   ''They ended as a complete flop,'' Haider said in Klagenfurt,
capital of Carinthia province, where he is governor. ''Democracy
cannot be unhinged by undemocratic means.''
</P>
<P>
   Haider also ridiculed a European Union statement stressing the
need to remain vigilant about the Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very pleased if we are being watched, like we will be
watching the others,'' said Haider, whose remarks sympathetic to
some aspects of Nazi rule raised alarm bells in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Haider also said it was time for small EU members to make sure
that ''a few self-appointed powers'' cannot ''run roughshod over
the small ones.''
</P>
<P>
   That touched on the outcry from Denmark and other small EU
members fearful of domination by France, Germany and other major
powers in the union.
</P>
<P>
   In a swipe against French President Jacques Chirac, whose nation
was among the strongest proponents for the sanctions, Haider said
the statement about vigilance was ''something to cheer up an
already sufficiently humiliated'' French chief of state.
</P>
<P>
   Haider, former leader of the Freedom Party, lashed out more
strongly against German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview to be published Thursday by the Austrian
magazine News, Haider said: ''Schroeder's monarchic arrogance is
unbearable.''
</P>
<P>
   In excerpts of the interview distributed by the Austria Press
Agency, Haider said Schroeder is among those ''people who are
trampling without feeling on anyone endangering their sphere of
influence.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Those are people who have no scruples,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions took effect when the Freedom Party joined the
coalition government of Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel in February.
The Freedom Party had waged an anti-foreigner and anti-EU expansion
campaign in last year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   Israel criticized the European Union's decision to lift
sanctions. Prime Minister Ehud Barak said they should have
continued so long as a party with ''neo-fascist characteristics''
remains in government.
</P>
<P>
   Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres said Wednesday he
didn't believe ''Israel will follow (Schuessel's) advice'' and
return its ambassador, which it had withdrawn to protest the
inclusion of the Freedom Party in the coalition.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations in New York, Austrian Foreign Minister
Benita Ferrero-Waldner said EU procedures on imposing punitive
measures against member states should be amended in wake of the
sanctions affair.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are all countries of rule of law so ... the European Union
has to be a union based on the rule of law,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Storms Flood Streets in Japan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Skies cleared Wednesday over cities swamped by
Japan's heaviest rain on record, but streets were still flooded and
fears of landslides kept hundreds of thousands of people away from
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The torrential rains Tuesday in central Japan -- bolstered by a
typhoon creeping up from the south -- killed seven people, stranded
50,000 bullet train passengers and forced Toyota and Mitsubishi to
halt production.
</P>
<P>
   Officials were scrambling to drain muddy water from flooded
streets in the city of Nagoya, said Kenji Ogawa, an official with
Aichi prefecture, which was hit hardest by the downpour.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, nearly 364,000 people were ordered to evacuate
their homes, though it was unclear exactly how many sought refuge.
</P>
<P>
   Ogawa said it was not yet known when those who did would be
allowed to return home because the threat of mudslides had not
subsided.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's largest automaker, resumed
operations Wednesday afternoon after shutting down factories
nationwide the day before, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi Motor Corp., which halted production at its two
factories in Nagoya, 165 miles west of Tokyo, had already gone back
online.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. Marine was swept away by high waves and drowned at a
military base on southern Okinawa Island, local police said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine was watching the typhoon-fed waves with friends on
the coast at Camp Schwab when he was carried away Tuesday evening,
a police spokesman said. The Marine's name and other details were
not available, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Typhoon Saomai, packing winds of 77 mph, was off the coast of
Okinawa and heading toward China late Wednesday, the Meteorological
Agency said.
</P>
<P>
   About 17,800 homes were without electricity on Okinawa at the
height of the storm, but power has since been restored, said
Shinsaku Toma, a spokesman for Okinawa Electric Power Co.
</P>
<P>
   Okinawa is about 1,000 miles southwest of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   In central Japan, rainfall totaling 23 inches was recorded in
Tokai, near Nagoya, the local observatory said.
</P>
<P>
   The downpour was the heaviest ever recorded in Japan, the
Meteorological Agency said.

<HEADLINE> 2001 Targeted for Clinton Bar Case  </HEADLINE>
By JAMES JEFFERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- President Clinton's disbarment case
probably won't be heard by an Arkansas judge before the president
leaves office next year, the judge's law clerk said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Leon Johnson has a full docket and won't make any special
effort to squeeze in a Clinton hearing sooner, clerk Chantel Mullen
said. The president leaves office Jan. 20.
</P>
<P>
   However, some cases scheduled for trial are in settlement talks,
and one could drop off of the docket, allowing the Clinton case to
come up by the end of the year as requested by the state Supreme
Court disciplinary panel, Mullen said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was appointed in June to serve through the end of the
year for a judge removed from the bench. He accepted the Clinton
disbarment case after four judges disqualified themselves because
of their ties to Clinton while he was Arkansas governor.
</P>
<P>
   The disciplinary committee moved to have Clinton stripped of his
license to practice law in his home state for denying under oath
that he had a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said disbarment would be too harsh a punishment.
</P>
<P>
   The president was earlier found in contempt of court over the
testimony. He did not fight the citation and paid $90,000 in fines.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian-Israeli Talks To Resume  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LAVIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel-Palestinian talks are to resume Thursday
in New York, a Palestinian Cabinet minister said, following an
invitation from Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat met with his negotiations
steering committee Wednesday to discuss the invitation, described
by Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo as a ''surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Palestinian negotiators Saeb Erekat and Mohammed Dahlan
are to arrive in New York on Thursday to resume the talks.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton failed to break the deadlock over control of
holy sites in Jerusalem in separate meetings with Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in New York last week.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's chief negotiator, acting Foreign Minister Shlomo
Ben-Ami, discussed the stalled negotiations in Washington on
Wednesday with National Security Adviser Sandy Berger. Ben-Ami said
American officials would meet separately with the Israelis and
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians were poised to declare independence Wednesday, the
seventh anniversary of the signing of the first Israel-Palestinian
accord, but put it off to give the talks another chance.
</P>
<P>
   Israel suggested a solution to a territorial issue -- a bridge
over Israel to link the West Bank and Gaza in exchange for Israeli
annexation of parts of the West Bank where most Jewish settlers
live.
</P>
<P>
   Ben-Ami said Israel demands overall sovereignty on the Temple
Mount, known to Muslims as Haram as-Sharif, the Noble Sanctuary.
Ben-Ami said the two sides must ''find some kind of accommodation
that will respect the needs of everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to counter Palestinian concerns that Israel excavate
under the Muslim shrines to uncover the ruins of the Temples,
Ben-Ami told the Al-Ayam newspaper, ''We will obviously take all
commitments not to dig, all international guarantees necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Nabil Aburdeneh, an aide to Arafat, rejected compromise.
''Jerusalem is a Palestinian city, and it should be under full
Palestinian sovereignty,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has charged that Arafat's inflexible position on Jerusalem
stymied negotiations. Barak's spokesman, Gadi Baltiansky, said,
''We showed openness and flexibility, but the other side was not
ripe for it.''
</P>
<P>
   About 200 Israeli demonstrators marched to the Old City of
Jerusalem at nightfall, demanding that Israel allow the
Palestinians to declare a capital in their part of the city. The
dovish Peace Now group organized the gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Erekat complained that interim accords have not been implemented
and demanded international guarantees to force Israel to comply.
''It is sickening, it is frustrating, and Israel cannot get away
with it,'' he told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   One of the leftover interim commitments is handing over part of
the West Bank to Palestinian control. Barak hoped to incorporate
that into a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Barak wants to place blocs of West Bank Jewish settlements under
Israeli sovereignty. In exchange, Ben-Ami said, the Palestinians
could freely use a bridge that would be built between the West Bank
and Gaza, separated by 30 miles of Israeli territory.
</P>
<P>
   Ben-Ami said Israel would maintain sovereignty over the elevated
road but would conduct no security checks there.

<HEADLINE> House Upholds Marriage Tax Cut Veto  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted Wednesday to sustain President
Clinton's veto of a bill that would have cut income taxes for
millions of married couples, killing a major piece of Republicans'
tax agenda but also giving them ammunition for the fall campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ''Americans understand it is wrong to tax marriage,'' said House
Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas. ''We will have to put it up on
the floor next year and have a president who will sign it.''
</P>
<P>
   The 270-158 vote was 16 fewer than the two-thirds necessary to
override the veto of the ''marriage penalty'' bill. Forty-nine
Democrats joined all 220 Republicans and one independent who voted
to override, with 157 Democrats and one independent voting to back
the president.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was aimed at cutting taxes for 25 million dual-income
couples who pay more than they would if single. But almost all
married couples stood to benefit from the legislation, which would
have cut their taxes by $292 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would have cut taxes for millions of couples who
already enjoy an income tax bonus, generally those in which one
spouse earns significantly more than the other.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said Congress would not
revisit the marriage penalty issue this year and would shift
attention away from broad individual tax cuts toward paying down
the national debt. Clinton previously vetoed a $105 billion measure
that would have abolished estate taxes over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he's going to veto tax relief -- the next choice at the
table is paying down the debt, and that's what we're going to do,''
Hastert told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Clinton said the bill would ''knock America off
this path of fiscal discipline'' -- which has produced growing
budget surpluses and paid down federal debt -- as part of an
unacceptable GOP tax relief plan costing $2 trillion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I urge Congress to work with me on a middle-class tax cut to
help Americans send their children to college, provide long-term
care for elderly or disabled relatives, make child care more
affordable and provide targeted marriage penalty tax relief,'' the
president said.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats accused Republicans of pushing for an enormous
tax cut purely for political reasons instead of negotiating for
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., said voters prefer
''tax relief that is affordable, feasible and reasonable, and is
targeted at the people who really need it. Let's stop the
posturing.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, however, believe the marriage penalty is a winning
campaign issue that will help them elect George W. Bush president
and preserve their slim grasp on Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a people's issue,'' said Rep. Zach Wamp, R-Tenn. ''I
clearly believe we're on the side of the people here.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the House had approved the override, the effort had
virtually no chance in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the House fell 14 votes short of overriding Clinton's
veto of a bill abolishing estate taxes, another issue the GOP will
highlight in fall election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The president last year vetoed a 10-year, $792 billion
Republican tax cut that included both estate tax and marriage
penalty provisions; GOP leaders this year attempted to send Clinton
the more popular elements of that bill individually.
</P>
<P>
   Those vetoes leave Republican leaders with few significant
victories on tax cuts despite a growing budget surplus over this
two-year session of Congress. Still on the table this year are: a
$76 billion package of business-related tax cuts to accompany a $1
rise in the minimum wage; a popular pension bill expanding
contribution limits for individual retirement accounts and 401(k)s;
a $55 billion bill repealing the 3 percent telephone excise tax;
and a $21 billion package aimed at revitalizing impoverished
communities.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage penalty bill would have:
</P>
<P>
   --Gradually expanded the bottom 15 percent income tax bracket for
married couples to twice that of the lowest bracket for single
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   --Raised the standard deduction for married couples who do not
itemize to equal that of two single people.
</P>
<P>
   --Increased the earned-income tax credit limit for low-income
families by $2,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   --Extended through 2004 a current exemption from the alternative
minimum tax for married couples who claim personal credits, such as
the $500 per-child tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   --------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 4810.

<HEADLINE> Crime Reporter Shot in Montreal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- A veteran crime reporter was shot repeatedly
Wednesday morning in an attack in his newpaper's parking lot, but
managed to call for help on his cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Michel Auger's injuries were not life-threatening, and he was in
stable condition at a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Auger was attacked as he walked into the offices of Le Journal
de Montreal. On Tuesday, the tabloid published a two-page spread
written by Auger about recent biker-related murders.
</P>
<P>
   Le Journal Publisher Paule Beaugrand-Champagne said Auger has
covered crime for 25 years and has been threatened in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is disgusting because it's an attack on democracy,''
Beaugrand-Champagne said.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said Auger has always taken security precautions
and had been taking different routes to work every day.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was extremely careful,'' said Beaugrand-Champagne.
</P>
<P>
   The publisher said Auger was shot five times in the back.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal police Cmdr. Andre Durocher said Auger used his cell
phone to call 911.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was alert, oriented and in stable condition,'' said Eric
Berry, a spokesman for the ambulance service, Urgences-Sante.

<HEADLINE> Austria's Haider: Sanctions a 'Flop'  </HEADLINE>
By ROLAND PRINZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Hailing the lifting of European Union
diplomatic sanctions, Austria's right-wing firebrand Joerg Haider
on Wednesday labeled the measures a ''complete flop.''
</P>
<P>
   Haider, whose far right Freedom Party's inclusion in the
government led to the sanctions, said the measures failed in their
goal to force the party out of the ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Austria's 14 European Union partners lifted the seven-month
sanctions against Austria on Tuesday after a panel said the
measures stoked the nationalistic feeling they were meant to
punish.
</P>
<P>
   ''They ended as a complete flop,'' Haider said in Klagenfurt,
capital of Carinthia province, where he is governor. ''Democracy
cannot be unhinged by undemocratic means.''
</P>
<P>
   Haider also ridiculed a European Union statement stressing the
need to remain vigilant about the Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very pleased if we are being watched, like we will be
watching the others,'' said Haider, whose remarks sympathetic to
some aspects of Nazi rule raised alarm bells in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Haider also said it was time for small EU members to make sure
that ''a few self-appointed powers'' cannot ''run roughshod over
the small ones.''
</P>
<P>
   That touched on the outcry from Denmark and other small EU
members fearful of domination by France, Germany and other major
powers in the union.
</P>
<P>
   In a swipe against French President Jacques Chirac, whose nation
was among the strongest proponents for the sanctions, Haider said
the statement about vigilance was ''something to cheer up an
already sufficiently humiliated'' French chief of state.
</P>
<P>
   Haider, former leader of the Freedom Party, lashed out more
strongly against German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview to be published Thursday by the Austrian
magazine News, Haider said: ''Schroeder's monarchic arrogance is
unbearable.''
</P>
<P>
   In excerpts of the interview distributed by the Austria Press
Agency, Haider said Schroeder is among those ''people who are
trampling without feeling on anyone endangering their sphere of
influence.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Those are people who have no scruples,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions took effect when the Freedom Party joined the
coalition government of Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel in February.
The Freedom Party had waged an anti-foreigner and anti-EU expansion
campaign in last year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   Israel criticized the European Union's decision to lift
sanctions. Prime Minister Ehud Barak said they should have
continued so long as a party with ''neo-fascist characteristics''
remains in government.
</P>
<P>
   Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres said Wednesday he
didn't believe ''Israel will follow (Schuessel's) advice'' and
return its ambassador, which it had withdrawn to protest the
inclusion of the Freedom Party in the coalition.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations in New York, Austrian Foreign Minister
Benita Ferrero-Waldner said EU procedures on imposing punitive
measures against member states should be amended in wake of the
sanctions affair.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are all countries of rule of law so ... the European Union
has to be a union based on the rule of law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine told reporters at the
United Nations in New York that the sanctions had outlived their
usefulness and were becoming counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to know how to roll with the punches,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Supports New Hate Crime Bill  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Armed with more data showing hate crimes often
go unreported, President Clinton on Wednesday appealed to Congress
to pass hate crimes legislation. ''Only Congress can do what really
should be done here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton convened an event at the White House to release a new
Justice Department report that shows information on hate crimes
sometimes is not forwarded to the FBI. The report also says victims
of hate crimes tend not to report them and sometimes police lack
sufficient training to handle such cases.
</P>
<P>
   He said a hate crime is ''an even more dangerous kind of
infection'' than ordinary acts of violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think any of us believe we can ever root it out just
by punishing people,'' Clinton said. ''The most important thing is
that we do have the tools we need to take a strong stand before
these things spread even wider.''
</P>
<P>
   The president directed Attorney General Janet Reno to work with
state and local authorities over the next three months on a plan to
improve hate crimes reporting.
</P>
<P>
   He was joined by the widow of Ricky Byrdsong, a former
Northwestern University basketball coach killed in a 1999
hate-motivated shooting rampage, and Laramie, Wyo., police
investigator David O'Malley, who handled the 1998 slaying of gay
college student Matthew Shepard.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton acted as the House prepared for a nonbinding vote on
whether hate crimes provisions should be part of a defense bill.
The Senate voted 57-42 in favor of the hate provisions in June, and
Clinton urged House lawmakers to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Byrdsong said passage of the hate crimes legislation would
send a powerful message to bigots that their hatred will not be
allowed to become commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   ''The tragedy my family and I experienced is becoming the
American way,'' she said. ''If we allow this evil to spread, I
believe it will rock the foundation of this society.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan would add crimes motivated by sexual orientation,
gender or disability to the list of offenses already covered under
a 1968 federal law, and allow federal prosecutors to pursue a hate
crime case if local authorities refuse to press charges.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also provides financial and other assistance to
state and local law enforcement agencies in investigating hate
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   However, prospects for the House legislation are dim. Democratic
leaders emerged from a White House meeting on Tuesday saying
Republican leaders made it clear that the hate crimes package was
dead for the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice report was based on surveys of law enforcement
agencies. It found that 83 percent of the more than 10,000 law
enforcement agencies that participate in the FBI's hate crime data
collection program said no hate crimes had taken place in their
jurisdictions in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Of the agencies that reported no hate crimes, 31 percent
indicated they had investigated or reported at least one hate
incident. Clinton noted that as many as 6,000 law enforcement
agencies may have encountered a hate crime but failed to report
them -- underscoring a disconnect between what is reported to the
FBI and what police investigators believe.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the tendency for hate crimes to be underreported,
Clinton said, there were still 7,755 such offenses last year.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 51; Nasdaq Gains 41  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue chips fell on profit-taking while tech
stocks drifted higher Wednesday, amid investors' concerns about
third-quarter corporate earnings and the direction the market
itself is headed.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 51.05 at 11,182.18,
according to preliminary calculations.
</P>
<P>
   Broader indicators moved higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
edged up 1.90 to 1,483.89 and the Nasdaq composite index rose 41.04
to 3,890.55.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers were a reversal of Tuesday's close, when blue chips
ended the day up and tech stocks fell.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard to pin it all one stock, but I'd have to say J.P.
Morgan was the biggest drag on the Dow today,'' said Arthur Hogan,
chief market analyst at Jefferies &AMP; Co. ''The Nasdaq stocks, which
were very oversold, had a nice rally today.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the market opened, Chase Manhattan Bank announced it was
acquiring J.P. Morgan for about $36 billion in stock. J.P. Morgan
traded down $4.19 at $181.25, after weeks of its stock price
inching upward on rumors that it was an acquisition target. Chase
Manhattan fell $2.13 to $50.69.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is the third in the financial services industry in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Citigroup announced it was buying Associates First
Capital for $29.5 billion in stock and, on Tuesday, Goldman Sachs
said it would buy market maker Spear Leeds &AMP; Kellogg L.P. for $6.5
billion in stock and cash.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Knight Trading Group, a leading market maker, were up
$6.63 at $36.06, more than 23 percent, on speculation that it might
be next.
</P>
<P>
   Trading also reflected ongoing concerns that corporate earnings
reports due out month will be soft. The market has fallen into a
pattern of rewarding companies that deliver strong profits and
outlooks, and punishing those who don't.
</P>
<P>
   SCI Systems was off $9.94 at $46, a 17 percent decline, after
the electronics manufacturer said its quarterly results would fall
below expectations because of seasonal weakness in demand for its
products.
</P>
<P>
   Intel fell $3.69 to $61.25 after a Banc of America Securities
analyst cut his rating to ''market perform'' from ''strong buy.''
Last week, a U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffries analyst to ''buy'' from
''strong buy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're still half a month away from actual earnings season, but
we've already had key reports from companies like DuPont saying it
will be down. The market has not taken that news well,'' said Ricky
Harrington, a senior vice president at Wachovia Securities in
Charlotte, N.C. ''It's somewhat subjective, but I think the runup
of stocks that we saw before Labor Day has set the stage for
downside surprises.''
</P>
<P>
   DuPont shares fell sharply last week after the chemical company
said its earnings would be below expectations because of rising
costs and soft markets.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 6-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.06 billion shares,
ahead of 974.40 million shares on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index slipped 0.81 to 531.62.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average was up 0.94 percent.
Germany's DAX index fell 1.81 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was off
1.18 percent, and France's CAC-40 drpped 1.92 percent.c

<HEADLINE> Indian Leader To Visit White House  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Their differences over nuclear issues run deep
but President Clinton is preparing an unusually warm reception for
visiting Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee this week,
reflecting the improved climate between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee will address a joint session of Congress on Thursday
and will be received by Clinton on Friday at a ceremony on the
White House South Lawn that will include a 19-gun salute. A gala
dinner is planned for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore will interrupt campaigning on Friday to
be the host of a lunch for the Indian leader, who reportedly had a
phone conversation in recent days with the GOP presidential
nominee, George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say Clinton wants to build on what they
regard as Clinton's successful visit to India in March.
</P>
<P>
   The warming atmosphere between the two countries permits them to
deal more amiably with their differences, including U.S.
unhappiness with the nuclear tests India carried out in 1998 and
with India's refusal to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   India's position is that a decision on signing the treaty would
be made only after Indians reach a political consensus on the
nuclear issue. Clinton has called the Asian subcontinent ''perhaps
the most dangerous place in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   There is some resentment in India that not all of the U.S.
sanctions imposed on India after the 1998 tests have been removed.
The sanctions require the United States to oppose certain types
Indian loan requests from international lending institutions and
also bans sales of dual use technology to India. Pakistan also
carried out nuclear tests in the same 1998 time frame and is
subject to the same sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   K. Subramanyam, chairman of India's National Security Advisory
Board, said India would appreciate a lifting of some sanctions. If
Clinton does so, he said, ''It would go down well with the Indian
people who are finally overcoming their anti-American Cold War
mindset.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 tests sparked fears of an India-Pakistan nuclear
confrontation particularly over the disputed territory of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, without offering to mediate, has been urging the two
sides to undertake a serious effort to resolve the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   As U.S. officials see it, settling the problem would eliminate
the possibility of a nuclear war and also enable the two rivals to
utilize their energy and resources in far more productive ways.
</P>
<P>
   For most of 52 years since independence, India and the United
States were on opposite sides of the Cold War divide, a situation
Vajpayee sees as an anomaly. The world's two largest democracies,
he has said, should be natural allies.
</P>
<P>
   Kanti Bajpai, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution,
said Clinton's visit ''was a grand psychological and political
success, and there has never been a better time for an Indian
leader to deal and deliberate with Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Cohen, also of Brookings, says the ''specter of
collapse'' that haunted India since independence ''has now passed
and India is emerging as a great Asian power, joining China and
Japan.'' He notes that economic reforms hold the promise of
enabling India to realize its economic potential.

<HEADLINE> Senate Nixes China Trade Measure  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. relations with China stood on the verge
of a new era as the Senate neared completion of a bill to make
normal trade relations permanent.
</P>
<P>
   The last major barrier to smooth passage of the trade bill was
cleared Wednesday when the Senate defeated an amendment toughening
sanctions on China and other countries that traffic in weapons of
mass destruction. The vote was 65-32 against it.
</P>
<P>
   Even supporters of the sanctions proposal, offered by Sens. Fred
Thompson, R-Tenn., and Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., agreed that any
change in the bill could kill it for the year because the House
might not have the votes or the will to take it up again in the
final days of this session. The House passed the bill by 40 votes
last May.
</P>
<P>
   At least a dozen amendments remain to be dealt with, on issues
ranging from the business conduct of American companies in China to
China's human rights record, but none appeared to pose a major
threat. A final vote could come at the end of this week or early
next week.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today we have cleared the final hurdle and moved one step
closer to enacting one of the most important pieces of legislation
in a generation for U.S.-China relations,'' said Sen. Max Baucus,
D-Mont., a chief sponsor of the trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is very important momentum for final passage,'' said Bill
Morley, chief trade lobbyist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ''We
took this amendment particularly seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chamber and other business groups in the past year have made
the China trade bill their top legislative priority.
</P>
<P>
   Also the United States must extend permanent normal trade status
to China as part of China's impending membership in the World Trade
Organization. If it does not, U.S. businesses would miss out on the
significantly lower tariffs China has agreed to as part of its
entry into the WTO, giving foreign competitors a major advantage in
entering the expanding Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is critical to American agriculture'' that the bill pass
without amendments that would force it back to the House, some 65
agriculture groups wrote to senators this week. Unilateral
sanctions, the groups said in opposing the Thompson amendment,

labor camps.

<HEADLINE> Senate Nixes China Trade Provision  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. relations with China stood on the verge
of a new era as the Senate neared completion of a bill to make
normal trade relations permanent.
</P>
<P>
   The last major barrier to smooth passage of the trade bill was
cleared Wednesday when the Senate defeated an amendment toughening
sanctions on China and other countries that traffic in weapons of
mass destruction. The vote was 65-32 against it.
</P>
<P>
   Even supporters of the sanctions proposal, offered by Sens. Fred
Thompson, R-Tenn., and Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., agreed that any
change in the bill could kill it for the year because the House
might not have the votes or the will to take it up again in the
final days of this session. The House passed the bill by 40 votes
last May.
</P>
<P>
   At least a dozen amendments remain to be dealt with, on issues
ranging from the business conduct of American companies in China to
China's human rights record, but none appeared to pose a major
threat. A final vote could come at the end of this week or early
next week.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today we have cleared the final hurdle and moved one step
closer to enacting one of the most important pieces of legislation
in a generation for U.S.-China relations,'' said Sen. Max Baucus,
D-Mont., a chief sponsor of the trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is very important momentum for final passage,'' said Bill
Morley, chief trade lobbyist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ''We
took this amendment particularly seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chamber and other business groups in the past year have made
the China trade bill their top legislative priority.
</P>
<P>
   Also the United States must extend permanent normal trade status
to China as part of China's impending membership in the World Trade
Organization. If it does not, U.S. businesses would miss out on the
significantly lower tariffs China has agreed to as part of its
entry into the WTO, giving foreign competitors a major advantage in
entering the expanding Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is critical to American agriculture'' that the bill pass
without amendments that would force it back to the House, some 65
agriculture groups wrote to senators this week. Unilateral
sanctions, the groups said in opposing the Thompson amendment,
''have the effect of giving U.S. markets to our competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson's amendment would have strengthened monitoring of
China's weapons proliferation to such countries as Pakistan and
Iran, required non-trade-related sanctions on companies and
individuals that violate proliferation agreements and set up
procedures for the Securities and Exchange Commission to make
public those proliferators investing in U.S. capital markets.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese activities have ''resulted in a more dangerous world,''
said Thompson, who originally tried to move his proposal as

<HEADLINE> Sports Betting Bill Moves Ahead  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bill to outlaw betting on college sports
advanced in its against-the-odds march through Congress on
Wednesday, winning approval in the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The committee voted 19-9 to ban betting on amateur sports, a
type of gambling practiced only in Nevada. The Senate Commerce
Committee approved similar legislation in April.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Shelley Berkley, D-Nev., whose district includes Las Vegas,
said opponents will now turn their efforts to keeping the bill from
reaching the floor in the final weeks of the 106th Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, the House GOP conference chairman,
said Wednesday he still does not think the bill will get passed
this year. But the measure is proving stronger than many predicted.
</P>
<P>
   When it was introduced in January, some supporters acknowledged
passage was unlikely. Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona gave
the bill momentum by adopting it as a cause soon after abandoning
his presidential campaign, and the National Collegiate Athletic
Association enlisted prominent college coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Retired North Carolina coach Dean Smith, college basketball's
career victory leader, visited Capitol Hill on Tuesday to push for
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The measure has bipartisan sponsors in both chambers but is
drawing much of its key support from Republicans. Backers say the
integrity of amateur sports is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a chance for Congress, in the last hours of this
session, to do something good for a cause many Americans really
love and appreciate, and that's college sports,'' said Rep. Lindsey
Graham, R-S.C., a sponsor of the bill and its chief proponent on
the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents in Congress and in the gambling industry say almost
all of the gambling on college sports -- 98 percent -- occurs
illegally, outside the reach of Nevada casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., who lobbies for casinos as president of
the American Gaming Association, called the bill ''a cosmetic
response to serious campus gambling problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Anthony Weiner, D-N.Y., said the bill's real purpose is
''to get the camel's nose under the tent'' and begin a wholesale
assault on legal gambling.
</P>
<P>
   The committee voted down a substitute bill offered by Rep. John
Conyers, D-Mich., that would have created an Amateur Sports Illegal
Gambling Task Force and doubled penalties for illegal betting on
sports.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said the subject of illegal gambling ''has been studied
to death'' and urged committee members to ''stick to your guns''
and reject the Conyers substitute. They did.
</P>
<P>
   The committee debated another amendment offered by Rep. Asa
Hutchinson, R-Ark., to expand the proposed ban to outlaw all sports
betting, as requested by professional baseball, basketball,
football and hockey.
</P>
<P>
   But Hutchinson withdrew the amendment at the request of Graham,
who said he supported the idea but did not want to complicate the
committee vote.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., said this week that Majority Leader
Trent Lott of Mississippi assured the bill's supporters they will
get a chance this year to muster 60 votes to break a certain
filibuster by Nevada's senators.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's spokesman, Kevin Bishop, said House supporters of the
bill have been given no such promise that a vote will be held this
year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Booster Could Protect Against Polio  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Giving a booster shot in addition to the oral polio
vaccine is
the best way to ensure that babies in Third World countries are
protected from the virus, a study found.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In industrialized countries, three doses of oral vaccine are 95
percent effective in protecting children. But the rate in
developing countries is as low as 65 percent, perhaps because
youngsters there are resistant to the vaccine or the vaccine is not
properly refrigerated.
</P>
<P>
   In a study, researchers gave either booster shots or extra doses
of an oral vaccine to 785 9-month-old babies in Oman who had
already gotten five doses of oral vaccine. Only the booster shots
proved effective.
</P>
<P>
   The booster shots kept antibody levels high for at least six
months, Dr. Roland W. Sutter of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention reported in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The polio vaccine works by spurring the immune system to make
protective antibodies. Polio shots contain dead polio virus; the
oral vaccine contains a live but weakened virus.
</P>
<P>
   Although it has been nine years since the last case of polio in
the Western Hemisphere, the virus is still found in 30 countries in
South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.

<HEADLINE> Study Finds No Heart Harm from AZT  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   A small study found no heart damage in babies whose
mothers had
been given AZT to keep their infants from getting the AIDS virus.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several recent studies had suggested that prenatal exposure to
zidovudine, marketed as AZT or Retrovir, might damage babies'
hearts.
</P>
<P>
   The study by Dr. Steven E. Lipshultz of the University of
Rochester was a small one -- 48 babies exposed to the drug. He and
doctors in Boston, Cleveland, Los Angeles, New York, Houston and
Bethesda, Md., checked the babies' hearts every four to six months
until they were 5.
</P>
<P>
   The study was reported in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Without the drug, 25 of every 100 children born to HIV-infected
women will be infected with the virus, Dr. Lynne M. Mofenson of the
National Institute of Child Health and Human Development wrote in
an editorial.
</P>
<P>
   With zidovudine treatment, 23 of these infants will be spared
infection, she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The study was sponsored by the National Heart, Lung &AMP; Blood
Institute and by the National Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   Until another equally effective medicine is found, the data
strongly suggest the benefits outweigh any risk to babies' hearts,
said Dr. Claude Lenfant, director of the National Heart, Lung &AMP;
Blood Institute.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - What do you get when you mix murder, money and
sex - and soft Italian loafers?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is Gucci.
</P>
<P>
   The fashion dynasty that started as a mom-and-pop shoe shop in
1920s Florence ended up with heir Maurizio Gucci executed in 1995 -
by order of his ex-wife, with the family business on the brink of
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   This week in New York, the moccasin-maker was on its feet again,
capping its five-year turnaround with the reopening of its Fifth
Avenue store.
</P>
<P>
   And the lurid tale behind the signature horse-bit label was just
around the corner - quite literally.
</P>
<P>
   On East 53rd Street, a Manhattan publisher was marketing ''The
House of Gucci: A Sensational Story of Murder, Madness, Glamour and
Greed'' - a real-life thriller tracing three generations of Guccis.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an account of passion, fashion and finance, all wrapped
into one,'' says author Sara Forden, a former Milan bureau chief
for Women's Wear Daily and editor in chief of the new Italian
lifestyle magazine L'Una.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, she takes a close look at the company Guccio Gucci
opened in Fascist Italy, with artisans working in a gilded
Florentine palazzo. His son Aldo eventually took the goods
overseas, making the Gucci scarf and bamboo-handle bag symbols of
clout worn by the likes of Jacqueline Kennedy, Grace Kelly and
Ingrid Bergman.
</P>
<P>
   But Aldo's three sons, his brother Rodolfo and nephew Maurizio
didn't appreciate Aldo's arrogance, and their meetings often ended
with ashtrays and poisoned words flying. After the Fifth Avenue
store first opened in 1980, the family squabbles got so bad that
Aldo's son Paolo publicized financial documents showing that his
81-year-old father had evaded taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Then Maurizio ousted his uncle and cousins and, in 1993, sold
his share of the company to a Bahrain-based investment group.
</P>
<P>
   As the wild-spending Maurizio was about to marry his mistress,
his jealous ex-wife, Patrizia Reggiani, paid a stylishly dressed
gunman to kill her 47-year-old ex at his Milan office, according to
court testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The spurned socialite and the couple's two daughters attended
the funeral; months later, Patrizia posed for a photographer,
reclining on a sofa at home with a smile that could have been an
omen of what it took police two years to discover.
</P>
<P>
   Maurizio's once glamorous spouse was arrested on a winter dawn
in 1997 - now looking like a haggard middle-aged suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Her six-month trial the following year ''was the Italian
equivalent of the O.J. Simpson case in the United States,'' says
Forden. ''I couldn't have made up a more intriguing story.''
</P>
<P>
   She had a jailhouse correspondence with Patrizia, while Gucci
executives cooperated with the author as she researched the book.
</P>
<P>
   The woman the Italian press dubbed the ''black widow'' was
convicted of hiring her ex-husband's hitman and sentenced to 29
years in prison, later reduced by three years. Gucci store windows
worldwide displayed sterling silver handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the fashion empire itself was facing the law, with
exorbitant expenses and sinking sales.
</P>
<P>
   Incredulously, it would become the comeback kid of the industry,
with the Harvard Business School conducting a case study of its
rise and fall - and rise again.
</P>
<P>
   As the new Gucci-less Gucci Group, the company re-emerged on the
fashion map under the creative leadership of Texas-born designer
Tom Ford. Its Initial Public Offering was successfully floated on
the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   But the goods behind Gucci would never be the same.
</P>
<P>
   After all, when asked for the source of the original Gucci
magic, Maurizio's cousin, Roberto Gucci, replied: ''L'azienda era
la famiglia e la famiglia era l'azienda!!'' (The company was the
family and the family was the company!)
</P>
<P>
   And the family is gone, along with its signature style. Witness
the Gucci G-string on an all-but-naked man introduced in the 1997
collection.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's for effect rather than to wear. It's to get talked
about,'' says Eleanor Lambert, a New York-based fashion expert who
has studied international style almost as long as the Gucci firm
has existed.
</P>
<P>
   The prim, classical Gucci look of the last century ''is a dead
issue. It's a brand that they want to sell,'' says Lambert. And,
though she has high praise for designer Ford's talent, ''he should
be on his own. And Gucci should be forgotten because there isn't
any more Gucci. It's nonexistent. It's too bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's Web site now offers a sexy 21st century edge,
including some diaphanous ensembles for both men and women. The
moccasins still sport the trademark ''GG'' - Guccio Gucci's linked
initials - but the cool new image has coated the bloodied past.
</P>
<P>
   Only a touch of red is still attached to the Gucci name - a
crimson stripe on the latest black leather loafer.
</P>
<P>
   ''The House of Gucci, A Sensational Story of Murder, Madness,
Glamour and Greed.'' William Morrow, $26.

<HEADLINE> Burglary at DNC finance office in Manhattan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Three laptop computers and a handheld electronic
organizer were reported stolen from the Democratic National
Committee's regional finance office in midtown Manhattan, police
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   There have been several other burglaries in recent weeks of
offices at 2 Penn Plaza, a skyscraper where the finance office is
located, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The burglary was reported to police shortly before 10 a.m.
Wednesday. The last person in the office left at 3 a.m. Wednesday,
so the theft occurred sometime after that, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police did not know what was stored on the computers or the
organizer, and DNC officials in New York and Washington said they
had not heard about the break-in.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had one back in 1972,'' joked DNC spokesman Rick Hess,
referring to the burglary that year of the DNC headquarters at the
Watergate complex. The Watergate scandal eventually forced
President Richard Nixon to resign in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the finance office did not return telephone calls
for comment.

<HEADLINE> House Passes Trade Tax Breaks Bill  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rushing to head off European Union trade
sanctions, the House passed legislation Wednesday to set up about
$4.1 billion in new tax breaks for U.S. companies that would
replace a system invalidated by the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ''Enactment of this law is necessary to avoid an immediate
confrontation with the EU, to ensure the United States is in
compliance with the WTO and to avoid possible sanctions,'' Deputy
Treasury Secretary Stuart Eizenstat said. ''This legislation would
ensure that no U.S. companies are disadvantaged.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 315-109 to send the bill to the Senate, which is
expected to follow suit quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Congress intends to pass the bill before an Oct. 1 deadline set
by the WTO, which upheld an EU challenge claiming the U.S. Foreign
Sales Corporation tax law amounted to an illegal export subsidy.
The October deadline was set to allow the United States time to
replace the system without retaliatory tariffs on up to $40 billion
in U.S. exports.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unthinkable that we not pass this,'' said Rep. Bill
Archer, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Created to offset an EU tax rebate for its exporters, the
Foreign Sales Corporation program permits U.S. companies to reduce
income taxes by 15 percent through export subsidiaries set up in
offshore tax havens such as Barbados and the Virgin Islands.
Microsoft, Boeing and General Motors are only a few of the 6,000
companies, with 4.8 million workers, that get the $4.1 billion
annual tax break.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, costing the government roughly the same amount
each year, would set up new tax breaks that apply equally to
exports by U.S. companies and the products they make abroad. The
WTO ruling against the previous rules centered on their nature as
special exceptions in tax law.
</P>
<P>
   EU officials have already argued the new system is also an
illegal subsidy, but it is not clear whether they would bring a new
challenge to the WTO once it is in place. Even under expedited
proceedings, such a challenge would likely take several months to
settle.
</P>
<P>
   ''My impression is that the initial criticism is posturing,''
said Kimberly Pinter, who oversees corporate finance and tax at the
National Association of Manufacturers. ''I'm sure they're still
unhappy. I'm not sure they're willing to start a trade war over
it.''

<HEADLINE> State wants polluting plant to pay $5.2 million penalty  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PITTSFORD, N.Y. (AP) - New York wants the owners of a former
asphalt factory to pay $5.2 million for spewing noxious fumes into
the air over 14 years in violation of state environmental laws.
</P>
<P>
   In February, a judge ruled that the Monoco Oil plant in this
Rochester suburb was a public nuisance and ordered it shut down.
Since then, state officials say negotiations to get the company to
clean up an oil spill and other environmental damage have come to
naught.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the state Attorney General's office and the
Department of Environmental Conservation said they had returned to
court to try to force a cleanup and recover civil penalties of $5.2
million against owners Raymond, Norman and Gary Hurwitz.
</P>
<P>
   The trio were ordered to appear in court on Dec. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Monoco Oil had stored liquefied asphalt at the factory since
1983. The state said it had received hundreds of complaints about
noxious odors wafting over the factory since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The town of Pittsford sued the company in 1986 and again in
1992. A physical education teacher at nearby Pittsford Sutherland
High School told a judge that her outdoor classes often had to be
canceled because of the fumes.

<HEADLINE> Italy Leads Va. Execution Vigil  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Politicians led torchlight processions in Rome and
in cities across Italy on Wednesday in protest of the upcoming
scheduled execution of a convicted killer in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The countdown to the execution of Derek Rocco Barnabei, an
American of Italian descent, dominated headlines and newscasts in
Italy, which is strongly opposed to the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ''Governments can't kill people to make justice,'' Walter
Veltroni, head of the lead party in Italy's governing center-left
coalition, said at a protest outside Rome's Pantheon.
</P>
<P>
   ''Americans' consciences are moving, but the politicians are too
slow,'' Veltroni said, declaring Italy would keep up pressure for a
worldwide moratorium on the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 300 people took part in the protest in Rome -- a
politician-heavy crowd that included the leader of Italy's
communist party.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II earlier Wednesday added to appeals of Italy's
leaders to Virginia to stop the execution.
</P>
<P>
   Barnabei is scheduled to die by injection at 9 p.m. Thursday for
the rape and murder of a 17-year-old student at Old Dominion
University.
</P>
<P>
   Even after release of DNA evidence that Virginia said erased any
doubt of Barnabei's guilt, Italian media on Wednesday explored
Barnabei's suggestions that his fraternity brothers framed him in
the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Italian state TV aired the film, ''Dead Man Walking,'' Wednesday
night on the eve of the execution. Italian TV planned live coverage
from outside the execution site in Virginia in the hours leading up
to it.

   ''We have not totally completed our investigation,'' the
committee chairman, Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., told reporters
afterward. He declined to say anything more about the closed-door
session, but said the committee ''should have a report soon.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We did have a full discussion with Mr. Tenet,'' said Nevada
Sen. Richard H. Bryan, the committee's top Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Both the committee and the Justice Department are investigating
the discovery that Deutch had worked on some of the nation's most
sensitive secrets on unsecured home computers that also had
Internet access and were used by other members of his household.
</P>
<P>
   The security violations were discovered by the CIA when Deutch
left his post in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing was done about it by the agency until 1999, when the
case was referred to the Justice Department for review and when
Tenet, Deutch's former deputy, stripped his former boss of his
security clearances.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch, now a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, has admitted violating security rules but said he did
so unintentionally and did not mean to put the nation's secrets at
risk.
</P>
<P>
   Six senior CIA officials who handled the case after the breach
was discovered were reprimanded in May.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet was not included in the reprimand, but officials said he
received stern words from President Clinton about his own role.

<HEADLINE> BC-NY--Club King-Bail,383  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A Miami Beach nightclub impresario charged in a
mob murder case once sought the backing of the Colombo organized
crime family to expand his empire to New York City, a prosecutor
charged Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor James Walden claimed investigators have evidence that
Chris Paciello, 28, and his ''business partner'' visited the
Brooklyn social club of Colombo captain William ''Wild Bill''
Cutolo in 1997 - the year Paciello and Cuban heiress Ingrid Casares
tried to open a branch of their popular Liquid nightclub in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Mobsters ''were going to provide contractors for the club, they
were going to provide some of the protection for the club, they
were going to provide some of the bouncers for the club, and he was
going to pay them,'' the prosecutor said. The club plan fizzled in
the face of community opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Walden leveled the new allegations in Brooklyn federal court
while arguing against Paciello's request to ease the conditions of
his house arrest on Staten Island. The defendant is set to go to
trial Oct. 17 on charges he conspired with a Bonanno crime family
crew in a fatal armed robbery and a $300,000 bank heist during the
early 1990s; he has not been charged in the Colombo investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Outside court, defense attorney Benjamin Brafman called Walden's
allegations ''patently untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   The case against Paciello ''is razor thin, at best,'' Brafman
said. ''That's why we're eager to proceed to trial. We're confident
he'll be acquitted.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Paciello's arrest last year, authorities have portrayed
him as a mob-connected thug who reinvented himself in South Beach
by opening a string of celebrity hangouts including Liquid, Bar
Room and Joia.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Brafman told Magistrate Joan Azrack that the
conditions of Paciello's bail - which include footing the
$20,000-a-month bill for private guards - were too taxing. He said
his client had been forced to sell Bar Room to pay lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Brafman called the guards ''a very expensive baby-sitting
service that he can no longer afford.''
</P>
<P>
   Azrack ruled that Paciello could use $250,000 posted with the
court as security on a $15 million bond to help cover his expenses.

<HEADLINE> Army To Align National Guard  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army for the first time will align
National Guard divisions with active-duty Army corps, making it
more likely that part-time soldiers will ship out if war erupts in
Korea or the Persian Gulf, Army officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The change reflects Army leaders' search for ways to make better
use of the National Guard at a time when the active-duty force is
stretched thin by a variety of peacetime missions across the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Eric Shinseki, the Army chief of staff, is to announce the
plan Thursday at a National Guard convention in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Aligning a Guard division with an Army corps, such as the 18th
Airborne Corps based at Fort Bragg, N.C., is designed to allow the
guardsmen to focus their training on specific potential combat
situations. The 18th Airborne Corps, for example, is focused on the
Persian Gulf and other rapid reaction assignments.
</P>
<P>
   The new arrangement means members of the eight National Guard
divisions are more likely to be called on not only for major wars
but also as rotation units for peacekeeping operations in places
like Bosnia and Kosovo, according to Army officials who discussed
the matter on condition they not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   The change does not make National Guard divisions a part of the
Pentagon's official war plans, which are written by the commanders
in chief, or CINCs, of combat commands like U.S. Central Command,
whose area of responsibility includes the Persian Gulf. A CINC
could call on a Guard division, however.
</P>
<P>
   Shinseki, who took over as Army chief last summer, has made it a
priority to more fully integrate the National Guard and Army
Reserve with the active-duty force. The Army National Guard has
360,000 members in 3,200 units in 2,700 communities across the
nation. The active-duty Army has 470,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   Shinseki will announce that the 35th Infantry Division of the
Kansas National Guard, for example, is being aligned with the
Army's 5th Corps, whose operational focus is Europe. The 35th will
be ''teamed'' with Fort Riley, Kan., home of active-duty brigades
of the 1st Infantry Division and the 1st Armored Division.
</P>
<P>
   Also part of the 5th Corps team will be two separate National
Guard brigades, the 256th Infantry Brigade of the Louisiana
National Guard and the 278th Armored Cavalry Regiment of the
Tennessee National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   Details on which other National Guard divisions would be linked
to which Army corps were not immediately available. The two other
Army corps besides the 18th Airborne and 5th Corps are I Corps,
based at Fort Lewis, Wash., whose wartime focus is Korea and the
Pacific, and 3rd Corps, based at Fort Hood.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the National Guard have been pressing for the Army to
more fully integrate the active and reserve parts of the service.
Lt. Gen. Russell C. Davis, chief of the National Guard Bureau,
raised the issue during a speech Wednesday to the National Guard
Association of the United States in Atlantic City, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ''It can only improve or readiness and our training,'' Davis
said in remarks prepared for delivery. ''We will provide an
expanded capability to the Army that will far exceed its modest
cost.''
</P>
<P>
   There has long been tension between the active-duty Army and its
reserve component over sharing resources and decision-making
authority. Recently, for example, the National Guard complained
that its UH-1 Huey helicopters are rapidly approaching obsolescence
and that modernization dollars have gone mostly to the active-duty
fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The National Guard contributes to U.S. active-duty Army missions
in many ways. Just this year troops from the 49th Armored Division
of the Texas Guard assumed command of the American peacekeeping
contingent in Bosnia, becoming the first guard division to head an
overseas mission since the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   The National Guard has had a hand in virtually every major U.S.
military operation since the Revolutionary War, most recently
including humanitarian relief missions, peacekeeping and training
of new teams to help civilian authorities respond to incidents
involving germ weapons or attacks with other weapons of mass
destruction.

<HEADLINE> Inmate agrees to pay $1.1 million of false arrest award  </HEADLINE>
syfons
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - A man jailed for a 1993 fatal drive-by
shooting has agreed to give the state a portion of a jury award he
won in a lawsuit over an unrelated false arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said Wednesday the
settlement with Eric Ham is the first time Connecticut has
collected under a law that allows the state to recoup the costs of
incarceration from a prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   Ham is serving a 50-year sentence for the 1993 murder of Marilyn
Vega in New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe the settlement fully satisfies the state's interest
and eliminates the burden for taxpayers of incarcerating this
convicted murderer,'' Blumenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   It costs the state about $101 a day to jail Ham, Blumenthal
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ham agreed to give up $630,000 of the $1.1 million award he
received in 1996 after he sued two New Haven police officers for
false arrest in a 1991 murder case.
</P>
<P>
   A jury found that the officers should have included information
in an arrest warrant affidavit that could have cast doubt on Ham's
guilt. Ham was jailed for three months in that case, but the
charges were dropped.
</P>
<P>
   The state sued Ham after the jury verdict. The state Supreme
Court ruled in June that Connecticut was entitled to more than
$898,000 from Ham's award for estimated costs of his incarceration
from Oct. 1, 1997 through January of 2022, the date he would first
be eligible for parole.
</P>
<P>
   Ham, 27, agreed to the settlement last month as a way to end the
state lawsuit, create a trust fund for his 3-year-old son and pay
his legal bills, his attorney, William S. Palmieri, of New Haven,
said.
</P>
<P>
   Palmieri said the state's action was retaliation against Ham for
his successful lawsuit against two police officers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Eric had all the wrong things going for him,'' Palmieri told
The Hartford Courant. ''He was black, he was from an inner city and
he won a constitutional civil rights case against two police
officers for false arrest.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal said the state has several other collection cases
pending, including one against convicted murderer Kevin King. A
jury awarded King $2 million after he claimed correction officers
beat him in during an escape attempt; a judge reduced the payment
to $375,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''This action has nothing to do with Eric Ham's race or
background,'' Blumenthal said. ''It relates solely to the
seriousness of his crime, the length of his imprisonment and his
ability to pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The city of New Haven paid out the $1.1 million last week,
sending portions to the state, Ham's two attorneys and the trust
fund for Ham's son.

<HEADLINE> Law expands health insurance coverage to actors, self-employed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Actors and the self-employed will be
eligible for state health insurance coverage under a bill that was
signed into law by Gov. George Pataki Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The measure amends the Health Care Reform Act 2000, expanding
its Healthy NY program to include those who are employed in
non-traditional fields or on a project-by-project basis.
</P>
<P>
   The existing Healthy NY Program, which takes effect in January
2001, established a state-sponsored health insurance coverage for
small businesses with 50 or fewer employees.
</P>
<P>
   The new law allows eligible working uninsured individuals to
purchase the same benefits package available to small business
employees. Pataki said people like actors who lose eligibility for
group health insurance coverage because they are no longer working
the required minimum hours may now qualify for Healthy NY.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whether they are a future Tony Award winner or an entrepreneur
seeking to launch a new high-tech firm, thousands of budding young
stars of tomorrow will benefit from this expansion,'' Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor was joined by representatives of the Actors' Fund
of America at a bill-signing ceremony in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits will be available initially through health
maintenance organizations and other insurers approved by the state
Insurance Department. The department will also begin classifying
independent contractors and the self-employed as ''individual
proprietors,'' who may potentially qualify for Healthy NY coverage.

<HEADLINE> Book Tells Clinton Scandal Secrets  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton dispatched his personal
lawyer to break the news to Hillary Rodham Clinton that he had lied
about the Monica Lewinsky affair, rather than break the news
himself, a new book about the scandal says.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney David Kendall went to the first family's quarters in
the White House in 1998 to tell Mrs. Clinton that the president had
lied, according to the account in ''The Breach: Inside the
Impeachment and Trial of William Jefferson Clinton,'' by Washington
Post reporter Peter Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton had backed her husband's January 1998 finger-waving
denial of a sexual relationship with ''that woman, Miss Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   She was visibly shaken and grim-faced in the days following the
president's August 1998 disclosure that he had, in fact, had an
''inappropriate'' relationship with the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Baker writes that Clinton was so distracted by the impeachment
trial later that year that aides at White House meetings sometimes
had to answer questions for him. Clinton was impeached by the House
and acquitted in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The book also says that a key adviser approached several
Democratic Party leaders about a strategy to urge him to resign
when impeachment seemed almost certain.
</P>
<P>
   In the late summer of 1998, Baker writes, former White House
deputy chief of staff Harold M. Ickes ''told people that the only
possible way to convince his ex-boss to give up power would be to
put together a coalition of interest groups and key senior members
from Congress to go to him as a delegation and tell him there was
no way to hold the White House in 2000 unless he resigned.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the book, Ickes broached the idea to AFL-CIO
President John Sweeney, a longtime Clinton ally who replied:
''Let's wait and see, Harold.'' The idea faded away.
</P>
<P>
   Ickes, who is now advising Mrs. Clinton in her campaign for
Senate in New York, said he has not read the account.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got to read what he says before I'm going to comment on
that,'' Ickes said Wednesday. He refused to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about whether Kendall acted as an emissary to the first
lady, Ickes said: ''I know nothing about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall did not immediately return a call to his office
requesting comment.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Dion, a spokeswoman for Sweeney, confirmed the account
of the Ickes-Sweeney conversation is accurate: ''It speaks for
itself.'' Sweeney was out of the country at a labor conference and
therefore could not comment himself, she said.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said he does not know whether
the Kendall and Ickes stories are accurate and has no plans to find
out.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought I heard everything there was to hear about that
period of our history,'' Lockhart said. ''These are two things I
hadn't heard before, but I don't intend to become a historian.''

<HEADLINE> 22-year-old fliers aim to become youngest crew to circle Earth  </HEADLINE>
By BEN DOBBIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - After months of misadventure trying to
line up sponsors, two 22-year-olds took off in style in a
twin-engine plane Wednesday in a bid to become the youngest flight
crew on record to circle the globe.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm really excited - the day has finally come,'' Daniel
Dominguez said before joining fellow pilot Chris Wall aboard a
silver, 1957 Aero Commander 560E for a three-month trip they plan
to document with photographs and video on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The first of 36 stops in 32 countries was Bangor, Maine, with a
seven-hour flight from Newfoundland to the Azores islands in the
mid-Atlantic set for Tuesday. Another 22-year-old, photographer
Jesse Weisz, was to have accompanied them but can now afford to
travel ahead on commercial flights because of a late rush of
sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   ''World Flight 2000'' was originally supposed to take off in
June, but the high cost of fuel, landing fees and day-to-day travel
costs threatened to cripple the project. America Online stepped in
last weekend and more than doubled cash donations to $70,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''The flight's always been in jeopardy,'' acknowledged Wall, an
engineering senior at Rice University in Houston. ''A lot of people
saw the project as being risky.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominguez and Wall, who earned their pilot's licenses at age 17,
have downplayed the flight's ''youngest'' aspect. A 7-year-old
girl, Jessica Dubroff, was killed in 1996 while trying to become
the youngest person to fly across the United States, prompting
passage of a law banning record flight attempts by youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Aliengena, another California child also accompanied by his
father, became the youngest pilot to fly around the world at age 11
in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation history buffs think it's highly unlikely that the
oldest crew member aboard any of the more than 160 noncommercial
flights around the world since 1924 was as young as 22. Such
flights usually do not mention crew members' ages.
</P>
<P>
   Dominguez and Wall, both natives of El Paso, Texas, have logged
tens of thousands of flying hours. They bought the disused plane
with a $15,000 loan in 1998, renamed it ''Dreamcatcher'' and
refitted it with sophisticated avionics.
</P>
<P>
   After takeoff, Dominguez looped the plane back around the
Rochester airport. It zoomed past a crowd of well-wishers, less
than 100 feet above the runway.
</P>
<P>
   The longest leg will be a 14-hour, 2,042-mile hop from Hawaii to
San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Dominguez, who graduated in May with an economics degree from
the University of Rochester, said his biggest thrill has been
encouraging others to ''dream big,'' just like he has. ''That you
can inspire someone to do something is just fantastic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Through a Web site, worldflight2000.com, youngsters will be able
to follow the trio on excursions to volcanoes, reefs, temples,
marketplaces and historic homes from Turkey to Australia and Nepal
to Hawaii.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Leak Forces Evacuations  </HEADLINE>
By MARK STEVENSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Hundreds of people in central Mexico were
evacuated and 120 were hospitalized after an accident at a
pesticide factory released clouds of malathion pesticide,
authorities said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred late Tuesday at a plant owned by the
Mexican chemical firm, Tekchem, in the agricultural hub of
Salamanca, 200 miles northeast of Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   ''People reported dizziness, vomiting, and skin and eye
irritations,'' said Arturo Gutierrez, the civil defense director in
Salamanca. ''The cloud was quite dense and large.''
</P>
<P>
   About 1,100 people were evacuated, with about 500 taken to
improvised shelters at government buildings in Salamanca. Most of
them were able to return to their homes Wednesday after the
two-mile-wide cloud dispersed.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six people remained hospitalized Wednesday, and five of
them were under close observation by doctors for more severe
reactions to the gas.
</P>
<P>
   Malathion is used in the United States to kill mosquitoes and a
host of agricultural pests. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control
has said it doesn't pose a serious risk to most people, but the
pesticide is suspected of sickening 123 people in Florida in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   However, the quantity and density of the gas cloud involved in
Tuesday's accident was apparently far above what people experience
in normal spraying of the pesticide.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred when emergency valves opened automatically
after pressure rose in tanks holding malathion at the plant,
Gutierrez said.

<HEADLINE> Suspects waives extradition, to be returned to New Jersey  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - A casino security guard accused of
killing three men in a roadside ambush fled New Jersey because he
and his family were getting death threats, his lawyer said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd Massey II, 21, of Pleasantville, was charged with three
counts of murder in the slayings of three men on U.S. 30.
</P>
<P>
   After a confrontation in a bar with one of them early Friday,
Massey allegedly followed them into Atlantic City and then opened
fire with an AK-47 while they were stopped at a red light.
</P>
<P>
   He was arraigned Wednesday in Atlanta, where he traveled to stay
with an uncle and later surrendered to police. He waived
extradition to New Jersey to face the charges.
</P>
<P>
   He went to Georgia because he was worried for his safety, lawyer
Ann Shafer said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Massey, who is not now, nor has he ever been, a fugitive,
was here staying with relatives because there have been numerous
threats on his life, as well as on the lives of his family,''
Shafer said.
</P>
<P>
   She said Massey, through his uncle, contacted authorities after
learning they wanted to talk to him. The uncle did not implicate
Massey in the killings, Shafer said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We continue to be concerned about Mr. Massey's safety and the
safety of his family. We have expressed these concerns to the
authorities from Atlantic City; we have been told ... they are
aware of these threats and we trust that they will take every
precaution possible to ensure his safety as well as the safety of
his family,'' Shafer said.
</P>
<P>
   Massey, a former football player and homecoming king at
Pleasantville High School, is a part-time security guard at the
Sands Hotel Casino, where he was worked for just over a year.
</P>
<P>
   Co-workers there expressed shock at the news of his arrest.
Alfred Luciani, president of the casino, called it ''an
aberration.''
</P>
<P>
   The casino did a background check on Massey before he was hired
and a similar check would have been performed by state casino
regulators before he was issued a license, Luciani said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was always all right with me, I never knew him to do
anything like this,'' said Jamar Hunter, 19, of Pleasantville, who
played football with him in high school.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say he had an argument with Michael Demps at a bar
in Egg Harbor Township and then followed the car Demps was in down
U.S. 30 before jumping out and spraying it with gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   Demps, 20, of Pleasantville, and Richard White, 26, were shot to
death as they sat in the car. The driver of the car, Lamont Wilson,
21, was gunned down as he ran from the scene. A fourth man in the
car wasn't shot.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic County Prosecutor Jeffrey Blitz is refusing to release
that man's identity, nor will he name the passenger in Massey's
truck, who fled when the shooting began.
</P>
<P>
   Blitz wouldn't comment when asked if Massey's life had been
threatened. But he said no information about Massey's whereabouts
would be given until he is lodged in the Atlantic County jail,
which will be late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, a service person at Seaview Marriott Resort, was laid to
rest Wednesday after an emotional funeral mass at Mount Zion
Baptist Church that was attended by more than 300 people.
</P>
<P>
   Several mourners interviewed outside said Massey deserved to
die.
</P>
<P>
   ''He (Wilson) didn't deserve the raw deal he got,'' said Iziah
Alexander, 18, wiping tears from his eyes. ''Massey, I hope someone
gives him a raw deal like he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Others called for cooler heads.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line is that it's a tragedy happening throughout
our country,'' said Teddy Bryant, who runs an anti-violence program
at Pleasantville High School. ''This is another sad story about
young lives being taken senselessly.''
</P>
<P>
   At the scene of the shooting, meanwhile, a roadside memorial of
teddy bears, flowers, photographs and candles has sprung up.
</P>
<P>
   ''We love you, Ty,'' read the handwriting on a laminated collage
of photos and memorabilia dedicated to White, whose nickname was
Ty.

<HEADLINE> Student's parents: MIT agrees to pay $4.75 million  </HEADLINE>
By THEO EMERY
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) - The Massachusetts Institute of Technology has
agreed to pay $4.75 million, endow a scholarship and continue to
make sweeping policy changes in a settlement with the family of a
freshman who drank himself to death at a 1997 fraternity
initiation.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Krueger's parents, Bob and Darlene Krueger of Orchard
Park, N.Y., said they reached the agreement, announced Wednesday,
after two days of meetings with MIT President Charles A. Vest.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Campbell, a university spokesman, said that as part of the
settlement the university agreed to continue reviewing policies
that have been overhauled since Krueger's death.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most important thing to us is that the settlement allows
all parties to move forward with their goals of better education on
alcohol and a constant attention to curb alcohol abuse,'' Campbell
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent to the Kruegers earlier this month, Vest
apologized for the 18-year-old student's death.
</P>
<P>
   ''The death of Scott as a freshman living in an MIT fraternity
shows that our approach to alcohol education and policy, and our
freshman housing options, were inadequate,'' Vest said.
</P>
<P>
   MIT will pay $4.75 million to the family and establish a $1.25
million sholarship fund in the student's memory.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement also includes references to several policy
changes that have been made, including a requirement that all MIT
freshman live in university-owned, -operated and -supervised
housing as of August 2002. Also, no fraternity and sorority
recruiting events will be held during freshman orientation, and
freshmen will not be allowed to live in fraternities and
sororities.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, fraternities and sororities are required to have
resident advisers.
</P>
<P>
   The university is also more strictly enforcing rules against
underage drinking. The drinking age in Massachusetts is 21.
</P>
<P>
   If Vest ''follows through with all of his promises, we feel that
MIT will be a better place. And we hope other colleges will follow
suit,'' Darlene Krueger said.
</P>
<P>
   Krueger decided to join Phi Gamma Delta to obtain housing, his
parents said. After a hazing during which he drank large amounts of
alcohol, he slipped into a coma and died three days later.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors charged the fraternity as an organization with
manslaughter but were not able to bring it to court. MIT later
banished the fraternity.
</P>
<P>
   The family never sued MIT but would have if the university
hadn't agreed to the settlement, according to the Kruegers'
attorney, Leo V. Boyle.
</P>
<P>
   The Kruegers said they refused any confidential settlement
offers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were looking to make people aware of what goes on in the
college and to keep it from happening to someone else,'' Bob
Krueger said. ''We can only try and bring some good out of our
son's death.''
</P>
<P>
   After the student's death, two dozen Boston-area colleges and
universities - including MIT - pledged in 1998 to control underage
campus drinking.

<HEADLINE> House Committee OKs Gambling Ban  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bill to outlaw betting on college sports
advanced through Congress on Wednesday, winning approval in the
House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The 19-9 vote approved the measure to ban betting on amateur
sports, a type of gambling practiced only in Nevada. The Senate
Commerce Committee approved similar legislation in April.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Shelley Berkley, D-Nev., whose district includes Las Vegas,
said opponents will now turn their efforts to keeping the bill from
reaching the floor in the final weeks of the 106th Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, the House GOP conference chairman,
said Wednesday he still does not think the bill will get passed
this year. But the measure is proving stronger than many predicted.
</P>
<P>
   When it was introduced in January, some supporters acknowledged
passage was unlikely. Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona gave
the bill momentum by adopting it as a cause soon after abandoning
his presidential campaign, and the NCAA enlisted prominent college
coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Retired North Carolina coach Dean Smith, college basketball's
career victory leader, visited Capitol Hill on Tuesday to push for
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The measure has bipartisan sponsors in both chambers but is
drawing much of its key support from Republicans. Backers say the
integrity of amateur sports is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a chance for Congress, in the last hours of this
session, to do something good for a cause many Americans really
love and appreciate, and that's college sports,'' said Rep. Lindsey
Graham, R-S.C., a sponsor of the bill and its chief proponent on
the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the measure say almost all of the gambling on
college sports -- 98 percent -- occurs illegally, outside the reach
of Nevada casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., who lobbies for casinos as president of
the American Gaming Association, called the bill ''a cosmetic
response to serious campus gambling problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee voted down a substitute bill offered by Rep. John
Conyers, D-Mich., that would have created an Amateur Sports Illegal
Gambling Task Force and doubled penalties for illegal betting on
sports.
</P>
<P>
   The committee debated another amendment offered by Rep. Asa
Hutchinson, R-Ark., to expand the proposed ban to outlaw all sports
betting, as requested by professional baseball, basketball,
football and hockey.
</P>
<P>
   But Hutchinson withdrew the amendment at the request of Graham,
who said he supported the idea but did not want to complicate the
committee vote.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., said this week that Majority Leader
Trent Lott of Mississippi assured the bill's supporters they will
get a chance this year to muster 60 votes to break a filibuster by
Nevada senators.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's spokesman, Kevin Bishop, said House supporters of the
bill have been given no such promise that a vote will be held this
year.

<HEADLINE> Collins wants amendment to block court ban on parental notification </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The state Supreme Court said his parental
notification law was wrong. Now the Assembly speaker wants New
Jersey voters to overturn that decision with a constitutional
amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, R-Salem, said Wednesday his
amendment would give the Legislature clear authority to require
minors to notify a parent before an abortion or any medical
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the court ruled a law written by Collins was
unconstitutional ''because a minor's right to control her
reproductive decisions is among the most fundamental of the rights
she possesses.''
</P>
<P>
   At a Statehouse news conference, Collins said the court
overstepped its bounds with that decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''Parents have a fundamental right to counsel, care and manage
their children,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   The only remedy is to change the state constitution, Collins
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now we have a constitutional right to say what we believe
should happen in New Jersey with something so fundamental,''
Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill co-sponsor Assemblyman John E. Rooney, R-Bergen, said
voters should make this decision, not the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we have to go over the Supreme Court's head, that's what we
will do,'' Rooney said.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment does not mention abortion. It would only give the
Legislature the ability to pass laws on parental notification.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said he would formally introduce the measure in the
Assembly on Sept. 21 and have the matter scheduled for a Judiciary
Committee hearing Sept. 25.
</P>
<P>
   His plan is to have the amendment on the ballot in November
2001. The bill would need 24 votes in the Senate and 48 in the
Assembly, or simple majority votes in two consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
   If voters approve, Collins would then introduce a specific law
requiring notifications before abortions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents called that deceptive.
</P>
<P>
   ''What he wants to do is essentially mislead the entire New
Jersey public,'' Assemblyman Neil M. Cohen, D-Union. ''Really it's
a veiled attempt to have a vote on the woman's right to choose
without saying that in the amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   The amendment would also be challenged for violating several
sections of the state constitution, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This could be unique in New Jersey constitutional law because
it's very likely that you could have a constitutional amendment
that violates the constitution,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's National Organization of Women also denounced the
amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of our politicians are so committed to the anti-choice
lobbyists that they will alter the constitution, waste taxpayer
dollars and endanger young women's lives to get anti-choice
support,'' the group's President Elizabeth Volz said.
</P>
<P>
   The law voided by the state Supreme Court passed the Senate by
30-8 vote and cleared the Assembly by a 59-18 margin in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republican lawmakers joined Collins to support both the
amendment and parental notification for abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ''In this case it's unconscionable to deprive a child of a
parent's involvement,'' Assemblyman Guy F. Talarico, R-Bergen,
said.
</P>
<P>
   The court has left unchallenged laws barring minors from
consuming alcohol or using tobacco, Talarico said.
</P>
<P>
   ''But when you talk about abortion, that's the holy grail. You
can't have any interference,'' Talarico said.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-abortion groups attended the news conference Wednesday to
support the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ''It comes down to who makes the decisions, the parents or the
abortion industry that makes a profit,'' New Jersey Right to Life
spokeswoman Marie Tasy said.
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco, R-Union, said in a
statement that he will have the proposal reviewed to see if it
matches the intent of the original notification law.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman is also likely to support the amendment, a
spokeswoman said. Whitman does not need to sign the bill if it
passes the Legislature.

<HEADLINE> Former Jet Mark Gastineau sentenced to 18 months in jail  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Former New York Jets star defensive end Mark
Gastineau was sentenced Wednesday to 18 months in jail for
violating court orders that stemmed from his tense relationship
with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan Criminal Court Judge A. Kirke Bartley, expressing
disappointment, sentenced Gastineau, 43, to a year on his guilty
plea in April to a misdemeanor assault charge and six months for
contempt of court.
</P>
<P>
   Gastineau's lawyer, Sharyn Stein, asked Bartley to give the
former football great another opportunity to straighten out his
life. ''He's a changed man,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bartley said as he sentenced Gastineau, ''I have given you
beyond a second and third chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The charges grew out of Gastineau's flouting of a 1998 court
order of protection to stay away from his estranged wife, Patricia
Schorr, and his failure to complete a court-ordered, year-long
anger management course.
</P>
<P>
   Schorr obtained the protection order after Gastineau pleaded
guilty in October 1998 to misdemeanor assault for hitting her the
previous month and threatening her with a glass cocktail table.
</P>
<P>
   In April this year, Bartley directed Gastineau to spend a year
at the Hope Christian Center, a Bronx treatment facility. If he
failed to finish the program, the judge said, Gastineau was
''surely'' going to jail.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 22, Gastineau walked away from the program after
threatening another resident, Assistant District Attorney Angela
Albertus said. In court Wednesday, she reminded the judge of his
warning to the former football star.
</P>
<P>
   Gastineau, who played for the Jets for 10 years, had previously
been found guilty of assault in 1984 and was sentenced to three
years probation in 1993 on drug charges.

<HEADLINE> Report: France Removes Land Mines  </HEADLINE>
By EMMANUEL GEORGES-PICOT
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- France has eliminated land mines from its weapons
arsenal and should press other nations to do the same, a report
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   France won high marks from the National Commission for the
Elimination of Anti-personnel Land Mines for destroying its arsenal
of more than 1 million land mines by Dec. 20, 1999, more than three
years ahead of a deadline specified in a 1997 treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty, reached in Ottawa, bans stockpiles of mines and
commits participating nations to destroy stocks within four years
and clear all mines from their territories in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''The commission can affirm that France has effectively
destroyed its entire stock of anti-personnel land mines as well as
the materials used to make them,'' said the report submitted
Wednesday to French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty specifically bans anti-personnel land mines, not
anti-tank mines.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty has been signed by 138 governments and ratified by
101. However, major producers such as the United States, Russia and
China have refused to sign.
</P>
<P>
   The United States says that land mines are necessary to deter
communist North Korea from invading South Korea, where United
States troops help to protect the border separating the countries.
</P>
<P>
   In accordance with the 1997 agreement, France preserved 5,000
mines for training purposes.
</P>
<P>
   According to the International Campaign to Ban Land Mines,
governments have destroyed about 17 million mines in recent years,
but at least 250 million remain stockpiled, and tens of millions
are scattered in more than 60 countries. The devices kill or injure
an estimated 20,000 people each year, mostly civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The French commission was created in 1998 to ensure compliance
with the treaty's provisions.

<HEADLINE> Fiennes Provides Two Portraits  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL KUCHWARA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Let's hear it for chameleon power. In this case,
the ability of Ralph Fiennes to provide two strikingly different
yet mesmerizing portraits of a pair of Shakespeare's more
problematic heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-heroes, actually, may be more like it. ''Richard II'' and
''Coriolanus'' are not high on anybody's all-time favorite list of
the Bard's works, although ''Coriolanus'' seems to have had a
resurgence of productions in recent years and ''Richard II''
contains some of the master's most eloquent poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Fiennes, with an assist from director Jonathan Kent and a
superb company of supporting players, manages to make a compelling
case for both plays. He even finds something almost noble in these
two deeply flawed men, particularly Richard.
</P>
<P>
   The productions are courtesy of London's Almeida Theater
Company, which is running its own mini-rep at the Brooklyn Academy
of Music through Oct. 1. If the themes of both plays are
surprisingly similar -- the use and misuse of power -- their leading
characters are not.
</P>
<P>
   Fiennes' Richard is a petulant, prissy monarch, whose misguided
sense of divine right can only lead to disaster. He is a nervous
fellow, wary of the popularity of his cousin -- and immediate
successor -- Bolingbroke, who becomes Henry IV.
</P>
<P>
   The actor works effectively against his matinee-idol good looks,
twitching his dark, piercing eyes and twisting his body with the
nervous tics of a grievously insecure man. The stage at BAM's
Harvey Theater is carpeted in grass, a turf that Richard guards
with a possessiveness that borders on the neurotic.
</P>
<P>
   That possessiveness, particularly of his own crown, gets Richard
into a lot of trouble. With his banishment of Bolingbroke,
portrayed with a laser-beam intensity by Linus Roache, the king
sets in motion his own downfall.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Fiennes so effective is his ability to convey
Richard's realization of his own doom. It's more than melancholy.
This self-awareness involves the growing-up of one of England's
most childish monarchs, a process that Fiennes beautifully conveys.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't hurt that Fiennes has a rich, plummy voice that does
full justice to some of Shakespeare's most dazzling verse. Listen
to his rendition of Richard's ''Not all the water in the rough rude
sea can wash the balm off from an anointed king,'' and you'll
realize that Bolingbroke may eventually get the monarchy, but not
before he has forever sullied his own cause.
</P>
<P>
   ''Coriolanus,'' a semi-modern dress version set in a rigidly
class-conscious ancient Rome, represents neuroses of a different
sort. It's mostly blood lust, which Fiennes plays with a ferocity
that would unnerve the mightiest of soldiers. The actor is not a
physically large man, no Arnold Schwarzenegger, but his energy and
vocal strength make him a brutish giant even on the vast Harvey
stage.
</P>
<P>
   His Coriolanus is the only man who can contain the rabble of
Rome, a fact not lost on the empire's leaders who need someone to
defend the downtrodden against invaders. Yet Coriolanus would just
as soon hang the riffraff as fight for them, a quirk that
eventually takes him over to the side of the enemy, again played by
the excellent Linus Roache.
</P>
<P>
   The only person Coriolanus can't seem to conquer is Volumnia,
his mother. As played by the astonishing Barbara Jefford, she is a
a steely matriarch, a fearless woman who is even more of a warrior
than her son.
</P>
<P>
   If ''Coriolanus'' is not as satisfying as ''Richard II,'' it may
be because the man who is a Roman killing machine remains the same
throughout the play. His downfall is compelling but not as
heartbreaking or involving as the English king's. Still, with
Fiennes leading the charge, self-destruction has never seemed so
fascinating.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Urge Congress on Diamonds  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE RIZZO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A lawmaker seeking to require that diamonds
sold in the United States list their country of origin believes
Americans should have the chance to reject ''blood diamonds'' --
gems whose sales fund wars in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know where our cars are from, and the parts in them. We
know where our clothes and our cheese were made. Why can't we know
where a diamond, which represents a significant investment of
money, was mined?'' Rep. Tony Hall said at a hearing of the House
Ways and Means subcommittee on trade.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whether Congress likes it or not, American consumers will not
be a party to this blood trade,'' said Hall, D-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Americans buy two-thirds of the world's diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   An international diamond group urged lawmakers to hold off
action on Hall's certification bill.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Runci, president of Jewelers of America, who represented
the World Diamond Council at the hearing, said government officials
from more than 30 nations plan to meet in London next month to
coordinate action on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is simply not possible to legislate a national solution to
the conflict diamond problem in the U.S. market alone, without
inflicting significant economic damage on the diamond and jewelry
industries of the U.S., Israel, India, Belgium, Botswana, South
Africa, Namibia and Russia,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee chairman, Rep. Phil Crane, said Congress ought
to ''send a clear signal that conflict diamonds are not forever,''
a reference to an advertising slogan. But he cited concerns about
enacting a requirement that would violate World Trade Organization
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   In July, in Antwerp, Belgium, the international diamond industry
adopted strict new measures to stop rebel groups who trade gems for
guns to fight some of Africa's most vicious civil wars.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to increasing pressure from governments and human
rights groups, the World Diamond Congress approved a package of
measures to track diamonds from the mine to the jewelry store. The
industry promised severe penalties for dealers who break the rules
and buy or sell ''blood diamonds.''
</P>
<P>
   The diamond trade, worth some $6 billion a year, has been
tarnished by revelations that rebel groups in Sierra Leone and
Angola have bought their weapons through diamond sales and gone on
to commit atrocities in their fight against elected governments.

   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Supporters of Pat Buchanan filed a
lawsuit in Hartford Superior Court Wednesday seeking to place the
conservative commentator's name on the Reform Party ballot line in
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's lawsuit names as defendants Secretary of the State
Susan Bysiewicz and Donna Donovan, state chairwoman of the Reform
party, who believes Buchanan rival John Hagelin should be listed as
the Reform Party candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit came after officials in Bysiewicz's office announced
Wednesday that Buchanan had won a spot on the state ballot as the
choice of the newly minted Freedom Party of Connecticut - not the
Reform Party. Bysiewicz's office said that Hagelin, an Iowa
physicist, probably will not be listed on the ballot in Connecticut
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Bysiewicz made her determination after Hagelin and Buchanan
backers each submitted paperwork declaring their man to be the real
Reform nominee. Bysiewicz said her office could not sort out the
party's internal differences, and said that unless one of the
candidates withdrew or won a court challenge, neither would be
listed.
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin's supporters also failed to gather enough signatures to
list him on the ballot under the Natural Law Party, the party
banner under which he ran for president in 1996, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's lawsuit comes a day after the Federal Election
Commission awarded him $12.6 million in federal campaign funds
belonging to the Reform Party, and hours after a California judge
ruled that Buchanan, not Hagelin is the Reform nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Cherilyn Gulbrandsen, state chairwoman of the Buchanan campaign,
said the FEC ruling, combined with Wednesday's decision by a judge
in Long Beach, Calif., virtually ensures that Buchanan will be the
Reform Party candidate for president in Connecticut and across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have every reason to believe that (Buchanan) will be on the
ballot as the Reform party candidate at this point,'' Gulbrandsen
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a 35-page complaint, Gulbrandsen charges that Buchanan would
suffer ''irreparable loss'' if he is not listed as the Reform
nominee, and says Bysiewicz was wrong to declare the party
''over-nominated.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Bysiewicz declined to comment Wednesday on
Gulbrandsen's suit.
</P>
<P>
   The decision means that as of Wednesday, six presidential
candidates had qualified for the Connecticut ballot: Buchanan,
Democrat Al Gore, Republican George W. Bush, Green Party candidate
Ralph Nader, Libertarian Harry Browne and Howard Phillips of the
Concerned Citizens Party.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan, the Hagelin backer named in Gulbrandsen's suit, called
it ''typical of the slash and burn tactics (Buchanan supporters)
have been using state by state. Rules and facts don't seem to
matter to these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin's supporters announced Wednesday they have filed a
complaint with the state Elections Enforcement Commission alleging
that Buchanan supporters used fraud in gathering the Freedom party
signatures.
</P>
<P>
   In that complaint, Donovan charges that Gulbrandsen failed to
witness some signatures submitted to the state and submitted others
that were not genuine.
</P>
<P>
   Gulbrandsen angrily denied the fraud claim and said Donovan was
merely retaliating for a vote last month by Buchanan supporters to
remove her as state chair. Donovan does not recognize the Aug. 31
vote and says she remains the Reform leader in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey B. Garfield, executive director of the state elections
enforcement panel, said commission staff is reviewing Donovan's
complaint and will make a recommendation as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing on Gulbrandsen's suit is scheduled Friday at 10 a.m.

<HEADLINE> Family files civil lawsuit in Brooklyn to recover $300 million  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The family of Patrick Dorismond sued the city
and police officers for $300 million on Wednesday, aiming
particular criticism at Mayor Rudolph Giuliani for attacking the
man's character after his death.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, blamed
the city, Giuliani and former Police Commissioner Howard Safir, and
the officers for violating Dorismond's civil rights during a drug
buy-and-bust in Manhattan on March 16. The suit described their
combined actions as illegal, malicious, callous and negligent.
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond, a 26-year-old security guard, became the fourth
unarmed black man shot to death by police in little more than a
year when he was killed by an undercover police detective at the
corner of West 37th Street and 8th Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting occurred during a struggle outside a Manhattan bar
after the officer asked where he could buy drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Johnnie Cochran, who filed the lawsuit on behalf of his
family, said at a news conference that the Dorismond shooting was
''the ultimate case, we feel, of racial profiling.''
</P>
<P>
   Cochran, who has defended other high-profile clients like O.J.
Simpson and Sean ''Puffy'' Combs, said Dorismond had told the
detective he did not have any drugs, and yet was shot.
</P>
<P>
   He blamed the police department for searching Dorismond's
Brooklyn apartment after the shooting and Giuliani for releasing
sealed juvenile records to ''dirty up his character and
reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor at one point suggested that Dorismond had caused his
own death and refused to offer the family condolences.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to take him to task for demonizing a person who
was an altar boy,'' Cochran said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has since acknowledged that he made a ''mistake'' by
not expressing appropriate sympathies.
</P>
<P>
   Lorna Goodman, a lawyer for the city, said: ''We have no
comment. We haven't even see the lawsuit.'' The police department
also declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Rose Dorismond, the victim's mother, said she was pleased
that the civil lawsuit had been filed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess it's time for the justice to start,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Whitman signs bill to expand DNA testing for criminals  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - At first, only certain sex offenders were
required to give DNA samples to the state. Now samples from
murderers and other violent criminals will be collected by the
State Police.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman signed a bill Wednesday to expand the DNA
samples first allowed by Megan's Law in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say the DNA files will help police crack future
crimes. They claim the samples are like genetic fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now the broadening of DNA collection will be yet another tool
in helping law enforcement win new battles in the fight against
crime,'' Whitman said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Samples will now be collected from people convicted of murder,
manslaughter, second-degree assault, kidnapping and crimes
involving children where a victim is lured or when sexual conduct
impairs the morals of a child.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, only those convicted of certain sex crimes were
subjected to the DNA collection.
</P>
<P>
   The State Police now has over 5,000 DNA results on file.
</P>
<P>
   ''Testing sex offenders' DNA has proven enormously successful,''
bill sponsor Sen. Nicholas J. Sacco, D-Hudson, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will provide a great opportunity to help protect children
and adults alike from hardcore, dangerous convicts,'' said Sacco, a
sponsor of the original DNA collection law.
</P>
<P>
   Megan's Law is named for Megan Kanka, a 7-year-old Mercer County
girl raped and murdered by a neighbor. Residents claimed they did
not know he had two earlier sex assault convictions.
</P>
<P>
   The law allows prosecutors to notify communities to the presence
of certain sex offenders deemed dangerous after court hearings.

<HEADLINE> Senate Panel Approves Measure  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Senate committee approved a $104.7 billion
measure Wednesday financing veterans, housing, environment and
space programs that would ease some House-approved cuts in
President Clinton's proposals.
</P>
<P>
   But the measure, approved 27-1 by the Senate Appropriations
Committee, would still provide roughly $2 billion less than Clinton
wants for some public housing, environmental and science programs.
That gap could lay the groundwork for yet another chapter in this
year's budget battle between the White House and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   At the same meeting, the panel voted 27-1 to approve a separate
measure providing $441 million for the District of Columbia's
budget, just $4 million less than Clinton sought. The bill lacks
several controversial provisions included in the House's version of
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The two measures are now among 11 spending bills financing
domestic programs and foreign aid for fiscal 2001, which starts
Oct. 1, that Clinton and Congress must approve before lawmakers
return home for the fall campaigns. So far, only two spending bills
for the coming year -- both covering military programs -- have been
signed into law.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional leaders are hoping to negotiate compromises on the
remaining bills so that Congress can adjourn for the year in less
than five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's veterans-housing bill would boost spending
substantially over this year's levels for overall veterans,
housing, NASA, and National Science Foundation programs. And it
would provide $434 million for the AmeriCorps national service
program, a Clinton favorite that the House voted to kill.
</P>
<P>
   But the Senate measure still provides less than Clinton wants
for housing vouchers for the poor, instead creating a $1 billion
grant program for states to use build new low-income units.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not only do vouchers not work well, but vouchers do not
produce a single new unit of affordable housing,'' said Sen. Kit
Bond, R-Mo., chairman of the Appropriations Committee's
subcommittee that produced the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also would spend less than the president proposed
for the environment and the National Science Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Ricci, spokeswoman for the White House budget office, said
the bill has ''inadequate'' funds for vouchers and other low-income
housing aid, and for the science foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The District of Columbia measure contains money the
administration wants for tuition aid for some of the city's
students and for a new Metrorail station. And it lacks
controversial language the House version has limiting distribution
of hypodermic needles to illegal drug users and contraceptive
coverage for city workers.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 51; Nasdaq Gains 44  </HEADLINE>
By LISA SINGHANIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue chip stocks fell on profit-taking Wednesday
while high-tech issues drifted higher amid investors' concerns
about third-quarter corporate earnings and the direction the market
itself is headed.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 51.05 at 11,182.18.
</P>
<P>
   Broader indicators moved higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
edged up 2.92 to 1,484.91 and the Nasdaq composite index rose 44.38
to 3,893.89.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers were a reversal of Tuesday's close, when blue chips
ended the day up and tech stocks fell.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard to pin it all one stock, but I'd have to say J.P.
Morgan was the biggest drag on the Dow today,'' said Arthur Hogan,
chief market analyst at Jefferies &AMP; Co. ''The Nasdaq stocks, which
were very oversold, had a nice rally today.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the market opened, Chase Manhattan Bank announced it was
acquiring J.P. Morgan for about $36 billion in stock. J.P. Morgan
traded down $4.19 at $181.25, as investors took some profits after
watching the stock's price move upward for days on rumors that it
was an acquisition target. Chase Manhattan fell $1.31 to $51.19.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is the third in the financial services industry in
September. Last week, Citigroup announced it was buying Associates
First Capital for $29.5 billion in stock and, on Tuesday, Goldman
Sachs said it would buy market maker Spear Leeds &AMP; Kellogg for $6.5
billion in stock and cash.
</P>
<P>
   Knight Trading Group, a leading stock trading firm, was up $6.63
at $36.06, more than 23 percent, on speculation that it might be
next.
</P>
<P>
   Some technology stocks also fared well. Cisco Systems closed up
$2.44 at $61.31 and Sun Microsystems rose $3.88 to $118.19.
</P>
<P>
   But concerns about corporate earnings contined to dog stocks,
reflecting worries that the third-quarter numbers due out next
month will be soft. The market has fallen into a pattern of
rewarding companies that deliver strong profits and outlooks, and
punishing those who don't.
</P>
<P>
   Uncertainty on Wall Street in advance of third-quarter results
has made many investors reluctant to make any big commitments.
Their hesitance has contributed to the recent fluctuations and
caused high-tech and blue chip stocks to keep changing direction.
</P>
<P>
   SCI Systems was off $9.94 at $46, a nearly 18 percent decline,
after the electronics manufacturer said its quarterly results would
fall below expectations because of seasonal weakness in demand for
its products.
</P>
<P>
   Intel fell $3.69 to $61.25 after a Banc of America Securities
analyst cut his rating to ''market perform'' from ''strong buy.''
Last week, a U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffries analyst to ''buy'' from
''strong buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherwin Williams dropped $1.63 to $22.25 after the paint company
said quarterly earnings would not meet Wall Street expectations
because of higher raw material costs and tough competition.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're still half a month away from actual earnings season, but
we've already had key reports from companies like DuPont saying it
will be down. The market has not taken that news well,'' said Ricky
Harrington, a senior vice president at Wachovia Securities in
Charlotte, N.C. ''It's somewhat subjective, but I think the runup
of stocks that we saw before Labor Day has set the stage for
downside surprises.''
</P>
<P>
   DuPont fell sharply last week after the chemical company said
its earnings would be below expectations because of rising costs
and soft markets.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 6-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange. Consolidated volume came to 1.29 billion
shares, ahead of 1.20 billion Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index rose 1.57 to 534.00.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average was up 0.94 percent.
Germany's DAX index fell 1.81 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was off
1.18 percent, and France's CAC-40 dropped 1.92 percent.

<HEADLINE> White House Reviews Names Request  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House is considering media requests
for names of overnight guests after suggestions Wednesday that
Hillary Rodham Clinton offered overnight stays at the White House
to supporters of her Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're reviewing the requests,'' deputy White House spokesman
Jake Siewert said.
</P>
<P>
   The senior spokesman, Joe Lockhart, confirmed that political
supporters have stayed at the White House, but dismissed the notion
that the first lady did anything improper.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president and the first lady, over the last seven and a
half years, have always welcomed their friends and supporters and
political officials from around the country, (and) prominent
members of the arts community, to stay at the White House,''
Lockhart said. ''Within that group, there certainly have been
people who, as their friends, have supported them financially.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is seeking the Senate seat being vacated by
retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y. Some of her largest
contributors have also given to other Clinton campaigns and causes,
including the president's 1996 re-election campaign, his legal
defense fund and his planned post-presidential library.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration took fire after the 1996 campaign for
inviting big donors to spend the night. Republicans in Congress,
along with some less partisan critics, complained that the practice
dulled the majesty of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Lincoln Bedroom was never sold,'' Clinton said in 1997,
when the White House released a list of 938 guests who had spent
the night at the White House to that point in the Clinton
presidency. The list names did include political supporters, as
well as entertainment luminaries and old Clinton friends.
</P>
<P>
   The renewed interest in overnight guests followed a report
Wednesday from Internet columnist Matt Drudge.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan files suit to win place on Reform Party line  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW DALY
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Supporters of Pat Buchanan filed a
lawsuit in Hartford Superior Court Wednesday seeking to place the
conservative commentator's name on the Reform Party ballot line in
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's lawsuit names as defendants Secretary of the State
Susan Bysiewicz and Donna Donovan, state chairwoman of the Reform
party, who believes Buchanan rival John Hagelin should be listed as
the Reform Party candidate.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Cockfighting Bill Debated  </HEADLINE>
By FREDERIC J. FROMMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Collin Peterson isn't used to being
attacked by fellow sportsmen, and he wanted to make it clear
Wednesday that his anti-cockfighting bill doesn't mean he's soft on
animals.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got more dead animals on my wall than anybody in this
Congress except for Don Young,'' he said, referring to the Alaska
congressman who has a bear hanging in his lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson, a pro-hunting Democratic congressman from northern
Minnesota, is the sponsor of legislation that would ban the
interstate transport of birds for cockfighting. At a hearing of the
House Agriculture Committee Wednesday, he faced arguments from
cockfighters that his bill was just the beginning of an effort to
outlaw other forms of animal exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I remind my colleagues in the sportsmen's caucus that this is
a pretty slippery slope,'' said Rep. Chris John, D-La., in a barb
directed at Peterson, co-chairman of the Congressional Sportsmen's
Caucus. ''Cockfighting today, what about bow-hunting tomorrow?''
</P>
<P>
   Federal law currently prohibits shipping animals for fighting
across state lines, except for cockfighting birds bound for the
three states where the sport is still legal -- New Mexico, Oklahoma
and Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the legislation say that exemption needs to be ended
because it gives illegal cockfighters an easy out when confronted
by police -- they often say they are just raising the birds for
shipment elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a simple and straightforward bill which would see
birds treated and protected the same as dogs have been for more
than 25 years under federal law,'' said Lt. Sherry Schlueter, an
investigator with the Broward County Sheriff's Office in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition at the hearing came mainly from committee members and
cockfighters from the South, where many of the birds are raised for
cockfighting. Roughly 200 cockfighters packed the hearing room and
an overflow room.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Riley, R-Ala., said that when he was a farmer, he'd
kill 30,000 to 40,000 chickens a week -- they'd be hung upside down
and have their throats slit after a six- or seven-week life.
Cockfighting birds, by contrast, are raised for two years in a
''pampered'' environment, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I was the chicken,'' he said, ''and I had the option of
this two years of pampering and then one option to fight one
day...'' He didn't finish the thought.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Pacelle, a lobbyist and vice president of the Humane
Society, gave a different description.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cockfighting is a bloody and indefensible practice,'' he said.
Cockfighters pump the birds with stimulants to heighten their
behavior, inject them with blood-clotting agents so they can fight
longer, affix them with blades, ''and place them in a pit to hack
one another to injury or death,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson said that he has the votes to win passage in committee,
but a committee spokesman said there may not be time left this year
to schedule a vote this year. The Senate Agriculture Committee has
already passed the legislation.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Supports Hate Crime Bill  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Armed with more data showing hate crimes often
go unreported, President Clinton on Wednesday appealed to Congress
to pass hate crimes legislation. ''Only Congress can do what really
should be done here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Only minutes later, the House agreed in a nonbinding vote to
make the hate crime legislation part of a defense appropriations
bill. ''Today, with this bill, we as a society say that we will do
everything we can to protect people from these heinous acts, that
we will not rest until Americans are free from all violence,'' said
House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   The House vote was 232-192.
</P>
<P>
   ''This historic legislation will help fight hate crimes by
strengthening the law and providing state and local prosecutors the
tools they need to enforce it,'' Clinton said in a statement
released after the vote. ''I urge House and Senate conferees to act
swiftly on this legislation so I can sign it into law.''
</P>
<P>
   However, congressional sources who spoke on condition of
anonymity said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott told Clinton at
the White House on Tuesday the hate crimes provision would not be
made part of the defense bill.
</P>
<P>
   According to one source, Lott told Clinton, ''we'll talk about
it somewhere else, Mr. President,'' possibly as part of another
bill.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Wednesday's vote was a
strong statement of support for tougher hate crimes laws,
''regardless of whatever comments were made yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The Congress has an obligation to move on it this year,''
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton convened an event at the White House to release a new
report that shows information on hate crimes sometimes is not
forwarded to the FBI. Victims of hate crimes tend not to report
them and sometimes police lack sufficient training to handle such
cases, according to the study, written by Northeastern University's
Center for Criminal Justice Policy Research and by the Justice
Research and Statistics Association of Washington, D.C. The Justice
Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics paid for the report.
</P>
<P>
   He said a hate crime is ''an even more dangerous kind of
infection'' than ordinary acts of violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think any of us believe we can ever root it out just
by punishing people,'' Clinton said. ''The most important thing is
that we do have the tools we need to take a strong stand before
these things spread even wider.''
</P>
<P>
   The president directed Attorney General Janet Reno to work with
state and local authorities over the next three months on a plan to
improve hate crimes reporting.
</P>
<P>
   He was joined by Sherialyn Byrdsong, the widow of Ricky
Byrdsong, a former Northwestern University basketball coach killed
in a 1999 hate-motivated shooting rampage, and Laramie, Wyo.,
police investigator David O'Malley, who handled the 1998 slaying of
gay college student Matthew Shepard.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton acted as the House debated its nonbinding vote to add
the legislation to a defense bill. The Senate voted 57-42 in favor
of the hate provisions in June, and Clinton urged House lawmakers
to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans argued state courts could handle hate crimes
much better than the federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   ''All murders are hate crimes and I think what we're trying to
do is legislate by headline,'' said Rep. Kenny Hulshof, R-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., said lawmakers know they can't
legislate hateful thoughts ''but we do understand that when hateful
thoughts turn into hateful deeds, Congress must act.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Byrdsong said the legislation must be passed to tell bigots
that their hatred will not become commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   ''The tragedy my family and I experienced is becoming the
American way,'' she said. ''If we allow this evil to spread, I
believe it will rock the foundation of this society.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan would add crimes motivated by sexual orientation,
gender or disability to the list of offenses already covered under
a 1968 federal law, and allow federal prosecutors to pursue a hate
crime case if local authorities refuse to press charges.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also provides assistance to local law
enforcement agencies in investigating hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The report was based on a survey of law enforcement agencies and
found 7,755 hate crimes were reported last year. But 83 percent of
the more than 10,000 agencies in the FBI's hate crime data
collection program said none had taken place in their jurisdictions
in the previous year, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the agencies that reported no hate crimes, 31 percent
indicated they still investigated at least one. Clinton noted that
as many as 6,000 law enforcement agencies may have failed to report
a hate crime, underscoring a disconnect between what is reported to
the FBI and what police investigators believe.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Antidrug Guns Disappoint  </HEADLINE>
By KEN GUGGENHEIM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Four powerful machine guns the State
Department reluctantly bought for drug-fighting helicopters in
Colombia were pulled from service after they repeatedly
malfunctioned and threw the aircraft off-balance. The U.S. embassy
calls the weapons a ''big disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gau-19 Gatling guns, which the administration bought for a
total of $2.1 million at the urging of key Republicans and
Colombian police, are so expensive to operate they threaten to
''eat up our budget ... faster than it could possibly chew up
narco-terrorists,'' an embassy cable complained to the State
Department last month.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the weapons are ''temperamental'' and so heavy they
''can tip the aircraft dangerously forward,'' said the cable that
laid out problems with the weapons. The cable was obtained by The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Just months after being acquired from General Dynamics, the
triple-barrel, .50-caliber guns were broken down and could not be
used in the Black Hawk helicopters the United States provided to
Colombia. The helicopters are used to transport Colombian
antinarcotics police, who often face fire from heavily armed
leftist guerrillas who protect cocaine laboratories and coca
fields.
</P>
<P>
   General Dynamics spokesman Kendell Pease said the guns would be
fixed quickly, based on the findings of a team the company sent to
Colombia this week.
</P>
<P>
   The staffs of two key House Republican chairmen suggested the
difficulties with the Gau-19 likely stem from faulty installation
and misuse.
</P>
<P>
   The chairmen, Reps. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., and Dan Burton,
R-Ind., have been the leading advocates of the weapons and are
urging that more be bought in the next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Their aides say the Gau-19's rapid fire and large rounds are
needed to penetrate Colombia's dense jungle.
</P>
<P>
   ''The other weapons tend to be just noisemakers that scare the
crows away,'' said John Mackey, an aide to Gilman, chairman of the
House International Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Gilman and Burton, chairman of the House Government Reform
Committee, have repeatedly criticized Clinton administration
efforts in Colombia, accusing the State Department of trying to
foist unsafe, outdated equipment on the Colombian National Police.
</P>
<P>
   The questions about the Gau 19s come as the Clinton
administration is considering what weapons to buy for 60
helicopters -- Black Hawks and Hueys -- included in a new $1.3
billion U.S. aid package to Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials said the Gau-19 problems haven't been
a major setback to counternarcotics efforts because the helicopters
have been using other weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. embassy's Narcotics Affairs Section in Bogota
originally opposed the purchase of the Gau-19s because it didn't
want ''to be the guinea pig'' for what the cable described as an
''unproven item.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department, however, acquiesced to the wishes of the
Colombian police and congressional staffers, said a senior
department official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The Black Hawks were altered to accommodate the Gau-19 at an
added cost of $541,000. Those alterations were approved by the
helicopters' manufacturer, Sikorsky Aircraft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy cable said the weight of the guns and ammunition
leave the helicopters off balance and the guns' electric control
boxes frequently burned out.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, their 2,000-round-per-minute fire rate made them
''incredibly expensive'' given that the .50-caliber ammunition can
cost up to $4 a round, the cable said.
</P>
<P>
   Mackey said the expense is justified given the value of the
helicopters they protect.
</P>
<P>
   ''How would you ever explain it if a $15 million piece of
equipment is shot down and a Colombian crew is killed because you
don't have the right weapons system?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the electrical problems may stem from the pairing of two
different machine guns on helicopters: the Gau-19, using AC
current, on one side and the smaller-caliber MK-44, using DC, on
the other. He said that may also explain the balance problems.
</P>
<P>
   A Sikorsky spokesman, William Tuttle, said the Black Hawks
should be able to accommodate the Gau-19s.
</P>
<P>
   Pease of General Dynamics said the Colombian air force has
bought 34 Gau-19s in recent years and hasn't had major problems.
</P>
<P>
   The air force guns were installed by General Dynamics; the
police guns were installed by contractors not supervised by the
company, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The cable said that after the guns were acquired, General
Dynamics ''belatedly'' informed the embassy that only ammunition
manufactured after 1983 could be used. By then, State Department
had already sent Colombia 7 million rounds of .50-caliber Korean
War-era ammunition that the cable described as ''quite
serviceable.''
</P>
<P>
   Pease said the restriction was stated in manuals provided before
the weapons were purchased.
</P>
<P>
   With the Gau-19s out of service, Colombian police have tried
using older, single-barrel Gau-16 .50-caliber machine guns in
addition to the MK-44s. The Gau-16s are more accurate, can use the
old ammunition, and are small enough that a spare can be carried in
the helicopter, the cable said.

<HEADLINE> Police find 15 cars at bottom of lake  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MANCHESTER TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - Prosecutors are investigating
the discovery of at least 15 cars submerged at the bottom of a
90-foot privately owned lake.
</P>
<P>
   State Police divers pulled six cars, including three sports
utility vehicles and a red Porsche, out of the lake Wednesday. At
least nine more cars are believed to be at the lake's bottom, said
Greg Sakowicz, executive assistant Ocean County prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Sakowicz said the cars were fairly recent models, and said they
had been in the water for at least several months. The cars could
either have been dumped in the lake as part of an insurance fraud
scheme or stolen, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors were working with Manchester police on an unrelated
investigation when police informed them they had sent scuba divers
to find several cars at the bottom of the lake, Sakowicz said. He
declined to describe the unrelated investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Police divers pulled out the Porsche, a Land Rover, an Explorer,
a Blazer, a Ford Van and a Dodge Dynasty sedan Wednesday, Sakowicz
said. Authorities are tracking the cars' histories through their
vehicle identification numbers, he said. Some had New Jersey
license plates and some had Pennsylvania license plates.
</P>
<P>
   Sakowicz didn't know when authorities would return to retrieve
the other cars.
</P>
<P>
   The lake is located on an 8,000-acre tract of land that was the
former site of a mining company. He said the land was owned by
Hovnanian Enterprises Inc., one of the state's largest developers.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the company, Ed Rand, said Wednesday that he
could not reach key company officials for comment.

<HEADLINE> Judge refused to let MasterCard block Nader's ads  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Ralph Nader has learned that justice can be
priceless.
</P>
<P>
   That's because a federal judge on Tuesday rejected an effort by
MasterCard to stop the presidential candidate's parody of its
''Priceless'' ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge George B. Daniels said MasterCard failed to
prove irreparable harm and thus did not qualify for a temporary
order to block the ad campaign before the full evidence could be
heard.
</P>
<P>
   MasterCard's lawyers argued that Nader's television ad campaign
infringed on the company's trademark and copyright for its
''Priceless'' ad campaign, which had cost about $250 million since
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The MasterCard ads typically show a sequence of goods or
services and their values followed by an intangible - such as ''a
day when all you have to do is breathe,'' followed by the word
''priceless.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nader ads highlighting the need for campaign finance reform
say, ''Grilled tenderloin for fundraiser $1,000 a plate; Campaign
ads filled with half-truths, $10 million; Promises to special
interest groups, over $10 billion; Finding out the truth,
priceless. There are some things money can't buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniels rejected an argument by MasterCard lawyer Russell H.
Falconer that viewers might believe MasterCard was making a
political endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony L. Fletcher, Nader's lawyer, said the Nader campaign's
''right to express themselves in any manner trumps the rights of
corporations not to be made fun of.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Unless I completely misread the First Amendment, we are
talking about the highest form of protected speech,'' Fletcher
said.

<HEADLINE> State approves appointment of new Camden business administrator  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - State officials Wednesday approved the
appointment of a new Camden business administrator, rendering
meaningless the mayor's own appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Norton N. Bonaparte Jr. will begin work Oct. 2, replacing
retiring business administrator Preston Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   State officials made and approved the appointment because the
state Division of Local Government Services since May has been
overseeing finances in the city, the poorest in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Camden Mayor Milton Milan on Tuesday named acting business
administrator Heriberto Colon to the position, saying he, not the
state, has the power to hire and fire employees.
</P>
<P>
   But Ulrich Steinberg, director of Local Government Services,
said the mayor is mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not sure he understands the appointment process or how
things have changed with state supervision,'' Steinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Milan's action this week was reminiscent of July, when he
appointed, then swore in City Attorney John A. Misci Jr. as a
municipal judge. A state Superior Court judge ruled that the
appointment was invalid.
</P>
<P>
   Bonaparte, 47, will earn $98,500 annually. He has been the
Willingboro manager since 1995. He also serves as a senior adjunct
instructor at the School of Management and Business at
National-Louis University in McLean, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Bonaparte previously served as city manager in Glenarden, Md.,
and as a municipal official in Grand Rapids, Mich.

<HEADLINE> Bus crash on route to Lincoln Tunnel brings morning rush to a crawl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WEEHAWKEN, N.J. (AP) - Twelve people were taken to hospitals
Wednesday after two buses crashed head-on in the express bus lane
leading to the Lincoln Tunnel, jamming morning rush-hour traffic,
the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said.
</P>
<P>
   The crash happened just before 7 a.m. when an Olympia Trails bus
from New York left its lane, colliding with an NJ Transit bus
heading into New York, Port Authority spokesman Steve Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   Olympia driver Sandra Girons, 33, of Union City, and NJ Transit
driver Jack Poventud, 42, of Paterson, and five passengers from
each bus were taken to hospitals, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Port Authority police interviewed the drivers but had not
concluded their investigation so the agency would not comment on
what led to the accident, Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   NJ Transit spokeswoman Anna Farneski said her agency believes
the Olympia driver skidded on wet pavement into their oncoming bus
after braking to avoid an accident in which a car hit the rear of a
truck.
</P>
<P>
   Olympia manager Glen Behrens said, ''At this time, we're still
gathering information regarding the accident. We really can't tell
what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Girons has been driving for Olympia for ''seven to eight
months,'' Behrens said. Asked whether she had any tickets or
violations, he said, ''We're still looking at all of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Poventud has been driving for NJ Transit for 17 years and has a
''spotless'' record, Farneski said.
</P>
<P>
   The drivers were taken to Jersey City Medical Center, where they
were initially listed in critical condition. Both had been upgraded
to fair condition by late afternoon, hospital spokeswoman Lynn
McFarlane said.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman said the accident happened on Interstate 495, about 1.5
miles past the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   The wreckage was cleared about 9:30 a.m., allowing the tube
leading out of New York to reopen, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Delays persisted for about an hour, he said.

<HEADLINE> DEP to ask town to shut off well suspected of affecting Pinelands water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The Department of Environmental Protection
will ask Berlin Borough to shut off a municipal well because it
might be depleting water in the environmentally sensitive Pine
Barrens.
</P>
<P>
   The well, which serves 10,000 residents, will be out of service
for at least two weeks while Berlin officials conduct tests
required by the Department of Environmental Protection.
</P>
<P>
   The borough will monitor water flow at Kettle Run, a stream that
has lost about six inches of water since the well was turned on in
early June. Kettle Run is a habitat for the swamp pink, an
endangered wildflower that has been disappearing from the stream.
</P>
<P>
   The stream, in the Marlton Lakes section of Evesham Township,
ran dry in July. At the same time, residents noticed that many of
the swamp pink had disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin officials also must interview nearby residents, who say
the Berlin well has caused their private wells to run dry.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher J. Noll, Berlin Borough's engineer, told The
Philadelphia Inquirer for Wednesday's editions that the borough
would comply with the order, but that it might take a month to get
the funding and the necessary equipment in place. He said the well
would remain operational during that time.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Environmental Protection expects to receive
test results by Nov. 1.

<HEADLINE> Salem County slaughterhouse owner accused of threatening investigator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   QUINTON TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - The owner of a Salem County
slaughterhouse who has been indicted on charges of improperly
disposing of blood and animal waste threatened an environmental
investigator, the state attorney general's office said.
</P>
<P>
   According to a complaint filed in state Superior Court in Salem
County, Anthony Bonaccurso, owner of Salem Packing Co., threatened
Department of Environmental Protection specialist David Fields on
July 28 when Fields tried to issue him a notice of violation.
</P>
<P>
   Fields was investigating complaints of illegal dumping of bloody
runoff and entrails from the plant, which slaughters pigs, cattle
and lambs. Bonaccurso threatened Fields when he tried to issue the
violation notice, according to the complaint filed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Bonaccurso's lawyer, Robert Agre, declined comment Wednesday,
saying he had not seen the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of the disorderly person's offense, Bonaccurso, 70,
of Haddonfield, could face up to $1,000 in fines and six months in
jail.
</P>
<P>
   A state grand jury in July indicted Bonaccurso and the packing
company on charges of improperly disposing of blood and animal
waste, polluting nearby streams. A second indictment in August
included a second, identical count stemming from another
inspection.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of the charges in the indictment, Bonaccurso faces
up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $75,000.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictments, Bonaccurso or his employees dumped
blood and other animal waste products on the packing house property
between July 6, 1999, and Feb. 23, 2000. The waste flowed into
nearby Keasby Creek and was carried into the Salem River.
</P>
<P>
   The state Division of Criminal Justice launched an investigation
of the company's waste disposal practices after receiving
information from the Salem County Health Department. The state
Department of Environmental Protection assisted in the
investigation.

<HEADLINE> Report: School district doctor practiced after surrendering license </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PASSAIC, N.J. (AP) - School officials believe the district's
doctor continued tending to children after surrendering his license
13 months ago, a newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Dr. Edward S. Feldner could face renewed criminal
and civil charges, as well as new charges of practicing without a
license, authorities said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Passaic school district, which has 11,000 students, learned
through an anonymous tip that Feldner gave up his license after
admitting he wrote prescriptions for others that were for his own
use, the Herald News of West Paterson said.
</P>
<P>
   As the district's only doctor, Feldner gave physical exams to
athletes and band members, Superintendent of Schools Robert Holster
told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The district hired Feldner in 1996 and paid him about $50,000 a
year, Holster said. Feldner also practiced in Little Falls, where
he lived.
</P>
<P>
   Holster did not return messages seeking comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Feldner, 44, could not be reached for comment Wednesday. A home
listing was not found and the service answering his office number
said he could be reached only by mail.
</P>
<P>
   Feldner surrendered his license in August 1999 after admitting
that he had written prescriptions in the names of his mother, wife
and a fictitious person for four or five years, but kept the drugs
for his own use, according to a decree he signed with the state
Board of Medical Examiners.
</P>
<P>
   Feldner was required to stop practicing, but did not have to
notify patients or others of the surrender, according to supporting
documents. He was required to remove his name from listings and
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ''As part of the agreement, he did have to stop practicing
medicine, and he did have to take steps to prevent others from
thinking he is a licensed practitioner,'' board spokeswoman Genene
Morris said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He did not give us any notice that he was working for the
school district,'' Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   The board, which has civil authority, will review the matter for
possible sanctions, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Patients who want to ensure their doctor is licensed can check
with the board.
</P>
<P>
   State prosecutors have also been notified that Feldner may have
violated his pretrial intervention program, said Marilyn Zdobinski,
Passaic County deputy first assistant prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Feldner pleaded guilty in May to obtaining drugs by fraud and
possessing drugs. He could have faced up to five years in prison,
but was accepted into the pretrial program. Charges would be
dropped and he would face no prison time if he completes the
program.

against his captors Wednesday and claimed credit for helping to
drive Israel out of southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid, who has been in prisons since 1989,
showed that he has learned the language of his captors when he
spoke to reporters in Hebrew before a hearing in Israel's Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no justice. In this whole country there is no
justice,'' Obeid said as he and fellow detainee Mustafa Dirani, sat
waiting to appeal their detention. The panel of five judges made no
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Obeid, wearing a white knit prayer cap and a dark blue prison
uniform, spoke in simple but direct Hebrew about Israel's May 24
withdrawal from southern Lebanon after 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''We kicked them (Israel) out by force,'' said Obedi, who was a
local spiritual leader of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah when he was
kidnapped by Israeli commandos in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Dirani, a military commander for the Amal militia when he was
abducted in 1994, also had bitter words against Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there was no (Israeli) oppression I'd be in Lebanon,''
Dirani said in Arabic. ''They occupy your land, arrest you in your
own house, destroy your land, and kill your children.''
</P>
<P>
   Obeid was interviewed on Israel television shortly after he was
abducted. From then until a May 29 open court session, neither he
nor Dirani was seen in public.
</P>
<P>
   The two Lebanese have been held in Israel as bargaining chips in
any negotiations on the release of missing airman Ron Arad, who was
shot down over Lebanon in 1986 and captured alive.
</P>
<P>
   They remain in custody despite a Supreme Court ruling in April
that led to the freeing of 11 other Lebanese detainees, also held
as bargaining chips. The ruling said Israel cannot hold foreigners
unless they are a threat to state security.
</P>
<P>
   The Tel Aviv District Court has ruled that the two still
endanger national security and may be kept temporarily in
administrative detention. They have never been charged or put on
trial.

<HEADLINE> Challenger declares victory as recount looms in Democratic House primary </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELLPORT, N.Y. (AP) - Regina ''Reggie'' Seltzer says she ran for
Congress because ''we should have people in there who represent the
ordinary person.''
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary hardly describes Seltzer, who pulled off a political
shocker by running a dead heat in a Democratic primary against Rep.
Michael Forbes, a three-term congressman who last year switched
from Republican to Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Seltzer, who immigrated from Poland at age 8, is a
librarian-turned-lawyer (often working for free), plays tennis
twice a week, has written a book on children's rights and is a
sculptor in her spare time. Her only previous elected office was
one term on the Brookhaven Town Board in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The primary was far from decided Wednesday, but Seltzer - a
71-year-old, gray-haired, suntanned grandmother - bubbled with
optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think Washington is going to change me. At least, I
hope not. And if it does, there are enough people around who are
going to let me know that. Then they'll vote me out - and they
should,'' she said in an interview on her screened-in porch
overlooking Long Island's Great South Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Although a re-count was planned, unofficial returns showed
Seltzer clinging to a 39-vote lead out of more than 11,000 votes
cast.
</P>
<P>
   It could be at least a week before a winner is officially
announced. Election officials said 600 absentee ballots were sent
out but it was unclear how many will be returned by the Sept. 19
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference in Washington, Forbes, a
Republican-turned-Democrat, was not optimistic. ''Clearly, I am a
realistic fellow. When you end an election night with a deficit
vote, the likelihood of making up that deficit is pretty much a
longshot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really can't believe that I won,'' Seltzer said. ''I think
that this is a terrific example for high school kids, for college
kids - it says anybody, anybody in this country, can still have a
shot at running for government.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't have to be a multimillionaire, you don't have to
sell your soul to the private interests. You can just be a plain,
ordinary person - even a little old lady like me.''
</P>
<P>
   A lifelong Democrat, Seltzer moved to Long Island in 1960 with
her late husband, Stanley. With her two children in school, Seltzer
went back to college and got a degree in library science.
</P>
<P>
   She worked as a librarian for 13 years in the Patchogue-Medford
School District. In 1976, she ran and won a seat on the Brookhaven
Town Council. By 1980, however, the political winds shifted, and
she was out of a job.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's when a friend came to me and said, 'Now's the time to
go to law school,''' Seltzer said. At age 50, she enrolled at
Hofstra Law School. Today, she mostly works free for groups like
the Long Island Pine Barrens Society.
</P>
<P>
   ''She is a friend to all who need her,'' said Seltzer's longtime
tennis partner, Esther Glass. ''She has done work for no money for
many causes that she believes in.''
</P>
<P>
   About 350 people helped Seltzer in her upset bid, which was
funded on a $40,000 budget. Forbes had amassed a war chest of $1.4
million, some of that coming from a fund-raiser held last April
that featured President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't like to ask people for money,'' Seltzer said,
confessing that she was stunned by the money that came rolling in.
</P>
<P>
   Seltzer said her dislike of Forbes was fueled less by his change
in parties than his politics. Forbes had backed Republican Newt
Gingrich's ''Contract With America'' and is opposed to legalized
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Forbes sticks his finger out and whatever way the wind
is blowing to suit him, that's what he's goinwinner and
has no regrets about switching parties.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Seltzer took a moment to look back before forging
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ''In my household, my father and mother were strong believers
that people should be involved in government, should be concerned,
and that it was your responsibility as a citizen to do something to
help,'' she said. ''In my house, this country was considered to be
paradise.

<HEADLINE> EPA Helps Chicago on Clean Air  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP)-- The Environmental Protection Agency is
preparing to give officials in Chicago increased flexibility to
meet clean air requirements, even though the city is in violation
of federal air standards.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed regulation would declare all or parts of the
Chicago metropolitan area an ''economic development zone'' and make
it easier to expand or build new factories without running afoul of
the federal clean air law.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative, which is the first of its kind, brought
criticism Wednesday from a government watchdog group called Public
Employees for Environmental Responsibility, which called it ''a
special clean air exemption'' that could produce dirtier air.
</P>
<P>
   ''Something is mighty fishy,'' said Jeff Ruch, executive
director of PEER. He questioned the timing of the EPA initiative,
which comes as Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush
are in a tight presidential race in which Illinois is a pivotal
state.
</P>
<P>
   EPA spokesman David Cohen refuted any suggestion that politics
was involved in singling out Chicago for the innovative program. He
said Chicago had requested a more flexible approach to meeting
clean air requirements and ''if it works in Chicago we will expand
it to other cities.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago initiative is part of the agency's ''Project XL''
program which seeks to use more flexible and less onerous
approaches to dealing with pollution problems, while maintaining
the same pollution protection. The EPA's critics, including
congressional Republicans, often have been critical of the agency
for not being flexible enough in its pollution-control efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ''The idea is to provide regulatory flexibility in exchange for
even greater protection of public health than would have been
obtained otherwise,'' said Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   There are 32 XL projects, involving various pollution issues, in
operation across the country. The one proposed for Chicago is the
first to try to help metropolitan areas meet air quality standards,
but still expand economic development.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago is among the cities struggling to reduce air pollution
and comply with federal air quality standards without stifling
development. Bush has been under attack from environmentalists for
not doing enough to cut air pollution in Texas and especially
Houston, which last year surpassed Los Angeles as the city with the
most severe smog problem.
</P>
<P>
   PEER claimed that under the more flexible approach being offered
Chicago, a company seeking to build a new factory or expand an
existing one would not have to find other emission reductions to
make up for the additional pollution from the new facility. Such
offsets normally are required by the EPA.
</P>
<P>
   But Cohen disputed that claim.
</P>
<P>
   He said that under the proposal the city would have to develop a
''pool'' of pollution offsets in advance from which a developer of
a new factory, for example, would draw.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's meant to promote economic development in depressed areas
while getting greater air pollution reductions than would have been
obtained otherwise,'' said Cohen, adding that the offset must be 40
percent greater than under the normal permit requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ''The idea is to provide regulatory flexibility,'' said Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   But Ruch of PEER said that some regional employees, who are
members of his group, have complained about the Chicago program
''being politically bulldozed through the agency'' with publicity
and only a two-week public comment period.
</P>
<P>
   ''This smacks of a sweetheart deal,'' insisted Ruch.

<HEADLINE> Husband charged in fatal stabbing of wife; four sought in shooting in nearby town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BALDWIN, N.Y. (AP) - A 22-year-old was critically injured by a
gunshot wound to the head during a home invasion at his family's
house in Baldwin on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Maxwell was awakened by a knock at the home around 10:25
a.m, according to Detective Sgt. Daniel Severin of the Nassau
County Homicide Squad.
</P>
<P>
   When he opened the door three or four males pushed into the
house and shot him in the head, Severin said.
</P>
<P>
   The assailants ran away; police said witnesses provided only
vague descriptions.
</P>
<P>
   The victim was airlifted to Nassau County Medical Center, where
he was listed in extremely critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles away, in North Massapequa, Nassau homicide
detectives charged Anthony Guido, 41, with second degree murder in
connection with the fatal stabbing of his wife, Barbara Guido, 32,
in their home early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Guido was taken to the Nassau County Medical Center with
stab wounds to his stomach that appeared to be self-inflicted,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police responded to a call about a family disturbance at the
couple's house around 6:40 a.m.

<HEADLINE> US Men's Volleyball Has Competition  </HEADLINE>
By DENIS D. GRAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Still stinging from its last-place
finish in 1996, the U.S. men's volleyball team comes up against a
tough opponent in its first game in Sydney. And it gets worse after
that.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans are grouped in Pool B with three teams -- Italy,
Russia and Yugoslavia -- that coach Doug Beal believes are the top
medal prospects. Their first match Sunday is against Argentina, and
Beal says that's no pushover.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we're a little stronger than in 1996, maybe have a
little more depth and I think there are more experienced players on
the team,'' Mike Lambert, who also was a member of the team four
years ago, said Thursday (Wednesday night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   At Atlanta, the glory days of American men's volleyball of the
1980s were a distant memory. The team tied for ninth and last with
Poland, Tunisia and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll keep the game simple and communicate on the court.
That's a key area for us,'' Lambert, an outside hitter from
Kaneohe, Hawaii, said. The team will focus on serving, passing and
the three-man block.
</P>
<P>
   Blocking should be a key element in the opener against the
aggressive Argentines, described by Beal as ''one of the dangerous
teams.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They have some of the world's top players. It's a very
difficult opening match for us,'' Beal said.
</P>
<P>
   Beal said that seven to nine countries in Sydney are fielding
''legitimate medal teams.'' Pool B standouts include the
Netherlands, Brazil and Cuba, with Spain and Australia not far
behind.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think there have ever been such a high number of
quality teams in Olympic history,'' Beal said.
</P>
<P>
   A new scoring system, that will make matches shorter, might also
allow less-touted teams such as the Americans to spring surprises.
Beal reasoned that the longer the match, the greater the chance for
a consistently strong team to display its mettle.
</P>
<P>
   With rally scoring, a point will be at stake for every rally,
replacing an earlier system where only the serving team could earn
one. Matches will last about half as long under the new system.
</P>
<P>
   The American men, while faltering in recent years, have a solid
tradition. The United States, where volleyball was invented, took
the men's gold at the Los Angeles Olympics in 1984 and defended
their title successfully four years later at Seoul.

<HEADLINE> Russia OKs War Crimes Court Treaty  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Russia signed the treaty creating the
world's first permanent war crimes court on Wednesday, leaving the
United States and China as the only permanent Security Council
members that haven't endorsed it.
</P>
<P>
   The signing ceremony by Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov at U.N.
headquarters came as Canada launched an international campaign to
get countries to ratify the statute creating the International
Criminal Court.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 19 countries have ratified. With Russia's signature
Wednesday, 112 countries have signed. At least 60 countries must
ratify before the treaty can enter into force.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was one of seven countries voting ''no'' when
120 countries meeting in Rome in June 1998 approved the the
tribunal, which would have jurisdiction over genocide, war crimes
and crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   American officials felt the treaty yielded too much
prosecutorial power to the new court, leaving U.S. troops and
citizens vulnerable to politically motivated prosecutions. In
subsequent negotiations, Washington has tried to negotiate an
exemption for Americans to the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot accept reopening the treaty or exceptions for any
one country,'' said William Pace, head of the Coalition for an
International Criminal Court, an umbrella of grass-roots groups
lobbying governments to create the tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke at the launch of the Canadian ratification campaign,
which was announced by Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy to a
breakfast meeting of foreign ministers, ambassadors and U.N.
officials Wednesday on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly.

<HEADLINE> Gastineau sentenced to 18 months in jail  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Former Jets star Mark Gastineau was sentenced
Wednesday to 18 months in jail for failing to complete an
anger-management course after hitting his estranged wife.
</P>
<P>
   Gastineau admitted in May that he had violated terms of his
probation following a guilty plea to misdemeanor assault in October
1998. So, he was ordered to spend a year in a treatment center but
left after about four months, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Gastineau's lawyer, Sharyn Stein, asked the judge to give the
former defensive lineman another chance to straighten out his life.
''He's a changed man,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Manhattan criminal court Judge A. Kirke Bartley told
Gastineau, ''I have given you beyond a second and third chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems grew out of Gastineau's flouting of a 1998 court
order of protection to stay away from his estranged wife, Patricia
Schorr.
</P>
<P>
   She obtained the order after the 6-foot-5 Gastineau, who was 270
pounds during his football career, hit her and threatened her with
a glass cocktail table.
</P>
<P>
   In April this year, Bartley ordered Gastineau to spend a year at
the Hope Christian Center, a Bronx treatment facility. If he failed
to finish the program, the judge said, Gastineau was ''surely''
going to jail.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 22, the 43-year-old Gastineau walked away from the
program after threatening another resident, Assistant District
Attorney Angela Albertus said. In court Wednesday, she reminded the
judge of his warning to the former football star.
</P>
<P>
   Gastineau, who played for the Jets for 10 years and retired in
1988, had previously been found guilty of assault in 1984 and was
sentenced to three years' probation in 1993 on drug charges.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Renews Mideast Peace Plans  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- On the day the Palestinians were to have
declared statehood, the Clinton administration launched a fresh
effort Wednesday to restart Mideast peace talks. Israeli Foreign
Minister Shlomo Ben Ami said he was ''doubtful about the prospects
of success'' after a meeting with national security adviser Sandy
Berger.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ben Ami agreed to a hurriedly set dinner session Thursday
night with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and the
Palestinians sent top negotiators to New York to resume the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to try and give it a chance,'' Ben Ami said.
</P>
<P>
   He and Gilad Sher, a specialist on Palestinian issues, met with
Berger as the Clinton administration refused to abandon its drive
to fashion a compromise on the future of Jerusalem and on other key
issues, even with the passing of Wednesday's deadline for a
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Ben-Ami also took up with Berger promises by the administration
to improve Israel's strategic capabilities. He said U.S. assistance
should not be contingent on whether or not an agreement is reached
with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   He also called on the international community to make a strong
statement of support for peacemaking and said the Palestinians were
''regressing'' in their positions since President Clinton hosted a
summit with Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat at Camp David in July.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians have made similar complaints about Israel's
stand.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo called
Albright's invitation to send negotiators to New York ''a
surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   He said negotiators Saeb Erekat and Mohammed Dahlan would be
there on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's excellent news,'' U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
said in New York Wednesday night of the resumption of talks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton failed to break the deadlock over control of holy sites
in Jerusalem in separate meetings with Arafat and Barak in New York
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians were poised to declare independence Wednesday, the
seventh anniversary of the signing of the first Israel-Palestinian
accord, but put it off to give the talks another chance.
</P>
<P>
   Israel suggested a solution to a territorial issue -- a bridge
over Israel to link the West Bank and Gaza in exchange for Israeli
annexation of parts of the West Bank where most Jewish settlers
live.
</P>
<P>
   Ben-Ami said Israel insists on overall sovereignty on the Temple
Mount, known to Muslims as Haram as-Sharif, the Noble Sanctuary.
Ben-Ami said the two sides must ''find some kind of accommodation
that will respect the needs of everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to counter Palestinian concerns that Israel excavate
under the Muslim shrines to uncover the ruins of the Temples,
Ben-Ami told the Al-Ayam newspaper, ''We will obviously take all
commitments not to dig, all international guarantees necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Nabil Aburdeneh, an aide to Arafat, rejected compromise.
''Jerusalem is a Palestinian city, and it should be under full
Palestinian sovereignty,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has charged that Arafat's inflexible position on Jerusalem
stymied negotiations. Barak's spokesman, Gadi Baltiansky, said,
''We showed openness and flexibility, but the other side was not
ripe for it.''
</P>
<P>
   About 200 Israeli demonstrators marched to the Old City of
Jerusalem at nightfall, demanding that Israel allow the
Palestinians to declare a capital in their part of the city. The
dovish Peace Now group organized the gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Erekat complained that interim accords have not been implemented
and demanded international guarantees to force Israel to comply.
''It is sickening, it is frustrating, and Israel cannot get away
with it,'' he told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   One of the leftover interim commitments is handing over part of
the West Bank to Palestinian control. Barak hoped to incorporate
that into a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Barak wants to place blocs of West Bank Jewish settlements under
Israeli sovereignty. In exchange, Ben-Ami said, the Palestinians
could freely use a bridge that would be built between the West Bank
and Gaza, separated by 30 miles of Israeli territory.
</P>
<P>
   Ben-Ami said Israel would maintain sovereignty over the elevated
road but would conduct no security checks there.

   DENVER (AP) -- It's hard to imagine anyone having fond memories
of an environment consisting of flying batteries, spike-haired
enemies and expletive-laden insults.
</P>
<P>
   The rock-concert setting in Oakland suits Denver Broncos
quarterback Brian Griese just fine.
</P>

   ''It's kind of a carnival atmosphere. I enjoy it,'' Griese said

</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know about everybody else, but it's fun to go in there
and see all the characters. Once you get on the field and out of
the reach of all the fans throwing things at you, you can actually
play ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Griese has another reason to appreciate life in Oakland. It is
the site of his first victory as a starter in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   After a disastrous four-game losing streak to open last season,
Griese was benched in favor of Bubby Brister, who subsequently was
injured two days before the Oakland game.
</P>
<P>
   Griese completed 17 of 29 passes for 234 yards and one touchdown
in Denver's 16-13 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''To that point in my career, that was the biggest win I'd ever
had,'' he said. ''I'm sure you all know how I felt after going 0-4.
I needed a win. There was no two ways about it. It wasn't pretty,
but we ended up getting it.''
</P>
<P>
   Griese appears more confident this year and his productivity
ranks among the league's best.
</P>
<P>
   His 120 quarterback rating is tops in the NFL, and Griese also
is second in touchdown passes (5) and fourth in passing yards
(575). He has yet to throw an interception.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our offense has been playing well and scoring points, so I
haven't had to force many things,'' he said. ''The game has really
been coming to me. Hopefully, down the road it will continue that
way.''

<HEADLINE> Israeli Minister Questions Arafat  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Heading into an other round of ''incredibly
difficult'' negotiations, Israel's foreign minister questioned
Wednesday whether Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was ready to
take courageous decisions for peace.
</P>
<P>
   On the day the Palestinians were to have declared statehood, the
Clinton administration announced a new effort to break a deadlock
with separate talks with Israeli and Palestinian officials.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami said the
negotiations ''were incredibly difficult but also promising'' and
said Israel would do its very best to produce a settlement with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech marking Israel's newly won eligibility for the U.N.
Security Council, Ben-Ami said of Arafat: ''It is still an enigma
whether the courage is there for the Palestinian leader to make the
extra mile.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the foreign minister met at the White House with Sandy
Berger, President Clinton's national security adviser, and said he
was ''doubtful about the prospects of success.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ben-Ami accepted a hurriedly arranged invitation from
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright for dinner Thursday while the
Palestinians dispatched top negotiators to New York for separate
talks with her.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to try and give it a chance,'' Ben-Ami said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, meanwhile, said ''the obstacles remain daunting.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the Conference of Presidents of Major American
Jewish Organizations, Albright said ''the unprecedented progress''
made at the Camp David summit in July was due to Prime Minister
Ehud Barak's ''courage and vision.''
</P>
<P>
   The occasion for the speeches was a ceremony marking Israel's
acceptance in the West European group at the United Nations. This
will give Israel a chance it has never had because of an Arab
boycott to serve in rotation with European countries on the
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Lauder, president of the Jewish group, said ''no other
nation in the world was denied its rightful role'' and that Israel
still suffered discrimination in the world organization.
</P>
<P>
   Ben-Ami and Gilad Sher, a specialist on Palestinian issues, met
with Berger as the Clinton administration refused to abandon its
drive to fashion a compromise on the future of Jerusalem and on
other key issues, even with the passing of Wednesday's deadline for
a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Ben-Ami also took up with Berger promises by the administration
to improve Israel's strategic capabilities. He said U.S. assistance
should not be contingent on whether or not an agreement is reached
with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   He also called on the international community to make a strong
statement of support for peacemaking and said the Palestinians were
''regressing'' in their positions since Clinton hosted a summit
with Barak and Arafat at Camp David in July.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians have made similar complaints about Israel's
stand.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo called
Albright's invitation to send negotiators to New York ''a
surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   He said negotiators Saeb Erekat and Mohammed Dahlan would be
there on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's excellent news,'' U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
said in New York Wednesday night of the resumption of talks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton failed to break the deadlock over control of holy sites
in Jerusalem in separate meetings with Arafat and Barak in New York
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians were poised to declare independence Wednesday, the
seventh anniversary of the signing of the first Israel-Palestinian
accord, but put it off to give the talks another chance.
</P>
<P>
   Israel suggested a solution to a territorial issue -- a bridge
over Israel to link the West Bank and Gaza in exchange for Israeli
annexation of parts of the West Bank where most Jewish settlers
live.
</P>
<P>
   Ben-Ami said Israel insists on overall sovereignty on the Temple
Mount, known to Muslims as Haram as-Sharif, the Noble Sanctuary.
Ben-Ami said the two sides must ''find some kind of accommodation
that will respect the needs of everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to counter Palestinian concerns that Israel excavate
under the Muslim shrines to uncover the ruins of the Temples,
Ben-Ami told the Al-Ayam newspaper, ''We will obviously take all
commitments not to dig, all international guarantees necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Nabil Aburdeneh, an aide to Arafat, rejected compromise.
''Jerusalem is a Palestinian city, and it should be under full
Palestinian sovereignty,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Notes From Wednesday's Press  </HEADLINE>
AMERICAN LEAGUE
Orioles-Rangers
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: The Orioles entered Wednesday night's game with 285
doubles and were on pace to hit 318. The club record is 299 set in
1996 and 1999. ... OF Albert Belle missed his ninth straight game
with inflammation of his right hip and was given permission to
return to Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: C Bill Haselman will keep playing through the weekend
until he undergoes arthroscopic surgery on Monday to repair a
partial tear of his right rotator cuff. Haselman was Texas'
starting catcher Wednesday night against Baltimore. Team doctors
say Haselman can't further injure the shoulder by playing. Haselman
took over as the everyday catcher when Ivan Rodriguez broke his
right thumb and was lost for the season on July 24. ... Randy Knorr
and B.J. Waszgis will share the catching duties for the final two
weeks of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ------
Red Sox-Indians
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: RHP Rich Garces reported significant improvement in his
strained right groin after throwing on the side Tuesday. Garces,
who left a Sept. 7 appearance against Minnesota, said if the Red
Sox weren't fighting for a playoff spot he would be on the DL. ...
Reliever Rod Beck was on his way to the mound Tuesday night when he
saw Hector Carrasco warming up for the seventh inning. Beck
returned to the bullpen only to have pitching coach Joe Kerrigan
wave him in. ''It's a little embarrassing when you run out there,''
Beck said. ''It makes you look like you don't know what the hell
you're doing. I've seen it happen to other guys but it's the first
time I've done it.'' ... Rico Brogna, acquired in a waiver claim on
Aug. 3 from the Phillies, has hardly played since declining the
team's request to go to the minors on a rehab assignment. Brogna,
who is in a 2-for-15 slump, is also upset with comments GM Dan
Duquette made in a newspaper story saying Brogna's bat speed is too
slow.
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: RHP Charles Nagy will make his first start since May
on Thursday in the series finale against Pedro Martinez and the Red
Sox. Nagy had bone chips in his elbow removed on May 19. ''I'm
nervous, excited, the whole nine yards,'' he said. Nagy had tried
to return for his surgery early, but suffered a setback. ''It was
supposed to be 6-to-8 weeks and it turned into a four-month bear,''
he said. Nagy still has pain in his elbow. ''You know when it rains
and when it's going to be cold.'' ... Indians manager Charlie
Manuel said the odds were 50-50 that left-hander C.C. Sabathia
would start one of the games in Boston next week when Cleveland
plays back-to-back doubleheaders. Sabathia, the Indians' top
pitching prospect, has returned from the Sydney Games in Australia
after the U.S. team wanted him to pitch as a reliever. When the
Indians allowed the left-hander to go it was under the condition
that he'd be in the starting rotation and on a pitch count. ...
When he watches the Boston Red Sox, Indians manager Charlie Manuel
sees a lot of his team. ''They're real scrappy,'' Manuel said.
''We're almost the same kind of team -- except for Pedro.''
</P>
<P>

Blue Jays-Yankees
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: Going into Wednesday's game, Toronto's Triple Crown
threat, Carlos Delagdo, was homerless in 13 games. He still had 39
homers, three off Frank Thomas' league-leading total. ... Tony
Batista, in a 9-for-70 slump coming in, singled off Yankees 3B
Scott Brosius' glove in his first at-bat. ... The Blue Jays, tied
with New York for the AL East lead at the All-Star break, have gone
27-28 since in falling to third place, nine games behind the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: David Cone might actually have been helped by his
separated left shoulder, according to manager Joe Torre. ''It will
give him something to concentrate on,'' Torre said. ''Without any
problems, he got buried early.'' Because of the problem with his
non-pitching shoulder, Cone, scheduled to pitch Friday against
Cleveland, has pain if he gets away from his proper mechanics and
lets his hips fly open. ''Nobody will have to say, 'Keep it
closed,''' Torre said. ... CF Bernie Williams, who has missed seven
of eight games after straining his right rib cage, could be back in
the lineup Thursday or Friday. He's bothered now by a slight calf
strain.
</P>
<P>
   ------
Tigers-White Sox
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: The Tigers will probably miss RHP Pedro Martinez this
weekend when Boston visits. In fact, manager Phil Garner said he
has yet to see Martinez in a game. ''I'd like to see him pitch,''
Garner said. ''I'd like to beat him, too.'' ... Knuckleballers
Steve Sparks and Tim Wakefield will meet Friday. ... The Tigers had
gone four games without a home run, their longest stretch this
season, before hitting two Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: SS Jose Valentin, who has a bruise in his pelvic area,
has opted to not get a cortisone shot despite the pain. He was in
the starting lineup Wednesday. ... DH Harold Baines started for
only the 11th time since acquired July 31. Baines batted .220 with
eight RBI in August. ''It's been very difficult to get him
at-bats,'' Manuel said. ''It's probably been unfair to him. But you
can't get a guy more professional than Harold Baines.'' ... RHP Jon
Rauch, who split the season between Double-A Birmingham and Class A
Winston-Salem, was named Minor League Player of the Year by
Baseball America. Rauch was a combined 16-4 with a 2.66 ERA and 187
strikeouts and earned a spot on the U.S. Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   ------
Twins-Athletics
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: Utilityman Denny Hocking has wrecked the A's this
season. He tied his career-high with five hits against them on May
18, then went 3-for-4 against them Tuesday night, driving in all
three runs in a 5-3 Twins loss. Jason Giambi called him ''Babe
Ruth,'' and A's manager Art Howe suggested his team was going to
''Plan Z'' against him. ''At least I got him out once,'' said
Tuesday night's pitcher Mark Mulder. ''That guy is unbelievable.''
Hocking was in the leadoff spot on Wednesday and singled to open
the game, eventually scoring Minnesota's first run. ... OF Torii
Hunter missed his fourth straight game because of a groin strain.
He's expected back in the lineup on Friday when the Twins return
home to face Anaheim. ... LHP Johan Santana returns to the rotation
to start Saturday's game against the Angels. He made two previous
starts, but was sent to the bullpen. He's 2-2, with a 6.12 ERA this
season and will replace LHP Juan Romero (2-6, 7.36).
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: In case of a division tie between Oakland the Mariners,
the A's would travel to Seattle for a single game on Oct. 2. If the
A's and Angels tie, Anaheim would come to Oakland. If a playoff
game is needed to determine the wild card team, the A's would play
host Cleveland or Boston, and travel to Toronto, Anaheim or
Seattle. ... 3B Eric Chavez was given the day off to rest a sore
heel and because the Twins started LHP Eric Milton. Chavez is
hitting .196 against left-handers this season, but .268 in his last
45 games. ... OF Matt Stairs was also out of the starting lineup
because of his .170 average against lefties. Stairs is at .223
overall, second-worst in the majors to the Mets' Robin Ventura
(.222). Stairs is hitting .313 in September.

NATIONAL LEAGUE
Brewers-Mets
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: Curtis Leskanic had converted all nine save chances
before blowing Wednesday's opportunity in the ninth. ''I have all
the confidence in the world in Curtis,'' manager Davey Lopes said.
''Sometimes it just doesn't happen.'' ... Jeff D'Amico had a
career-high 10 strikeouts. ''That doesn't matter as long as I get
the guy out,'' he said. ... Marquis Grissom became the 65th player
to reach 400 stolen bases.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Mike Piazza, in a 5-for-34 slide, struck out all four
times he batted for just the second four-strikeout game of his
career. ''I'm very frustrated,'' he said. ''That's just the way it
is. Hopefully I hit rock bottom today and will bounce back.'' ...
The Mets, who are 33-37 on the road, head out on an 11-game road
trip to Montreal, Atlanta and Philadelphia after a dramatic,
extra-inning win. ''If there was ever a carryover effect, I'd hope
this would be it,'' manager Bobby Valentine said. ... Closer
Armando Benitez, out the past three days with a sore right big toe,
pitched the 10th for the win. ''I felt great,'' he said.
</P>
<P>

Marlins-Braves
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: The Marlins, who hold a 6-4 season edge over the Braves
with two games left prior to Wednesday night, are 30-30 against
Atlanta during the last five seasons, best in the NL. Chicago at
23-25 is next. ... The Marlins are 30-19 in one-run games, second
only in the NL To St. Louis' 24-15 record.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: The Braves had only 11 last at-bat wins entering
Wednesday night's game and since the All-Star break, only two -- on
July 16 and Aug. 11. Last season, the Braves won 31 games in their
last at-bat, including 15 after the break. ... LF B.J. Surhoff
missed his fifth straight game with a pulled right quadriceps and
is not expected back before the weekend at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   ------
Expos-Phillies
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: LHP Trey Moore, who was scratched as Wednesday's
starter, will be examined by Expos team doctor Larry Coughlin on
Thursday and will have an MRI performed on Friday. He experiences
stiffness in his left shoulder while throwing on the side on
Tuesday night. ... Montreal farmhands Brad Wilkerson and Shayne
Bennett will participate in the Olympics, with Wilkerson playing
for the United States and Bennett pitching for host Australia. ...
The Expos return home for a 12-game stretch before finishing the
season on the road. They do not have a scheduled off-day during the
month of September.
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: On Thursday, the Phillies will announce an
agreement with the newly formed Lakewood (N.J.) BlueClaws of the
Class A South Atlantic League. Currently, the Phillies have an
agreement with the Piedmont (N.C.) Boll Weevils. ... The Phillies
donated 15,000 tickets to the Junior Baseball Federation (JBF), the
agency that benefits sandlot baseball in the Philadelphia. The
tickets raised $300,000 for JBF. ... Two minor league affiliates,
Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre (International League) and Double-A
Reading (Eastern League), are in their league championships.
</P>
<P>
   ------
Cardinals-Pirates
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: Another night, another new position for Mark McGwire.
McGwire was officially the Cardinals' starting shortstop for
Wednesday's game against the Pirates. This is manager Tony La
Russa's way of getting one plate appearance for McGwire, who can't
play in the field because of patella tendinitis in the right knee.
McGwire had been listed as the second baseman and left fielder
previously. He leaves after his one at-bat and is replaced by the
real starter. McGwire lined a single to left against Todd Ritchie
and was replaced by pinch-runner Placido Polanco. Since La Russa
started using McGwire in the first inning of road games, McGwire is
2-for-5 with a home run in six plate appearances. ... La Russa
wants the Cardinals front office to put together a highlight tape
of some of C Mike Matheny's throws. ''He should be the Gold Glove
award winner,'' La Russa said. ''I don't know if you can campaign
for that or not.'' In Tuesday's game against Pittsburgh, Matheny
picked Alex Ramirez off second in the second inning and wound up
changing the complexion of a game the Cardinals went on to win
11-1.
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: Mike Benjamin was the Pirates' starting second
baseman on Wednesday. He had missed 22 games with a lower back
strain. ... Kevin Young worked out at first base on Wednesday and
pronounced himself ready to play after missing 15 games with a
groin strain. ''I want to play tomorrow if they let me,'' he said.
Manager Gene Lamont indicated he won't use Young for the opening
game in Houston but didn't rule out the possibility he might play
during the weekend series against the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ------
Cubs-Reds
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: Eric Young stole second in the first inning Wednesday,
his 52nd stolen base and the 26th in a row without being thrown
out. ... Kerry Wood pitched only the second complete game of his
career in a 2-1 victory Tuesday but has always done well against
the Reds. He is 4-0 in four starts dating to his 1998 Rookie of the
Year season. ... Tuesday's win was the 500th as a manager for Don
Baylor. He got the first 440 with Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: The Reds' team physician will watch Scott Williamson
throw on the side Friday to see if he can return to the rotation
next week. Williamson was scratched from his scheduled start
Wednesday night because he banged into a door in his home Monday
night and broke two toes in his right foot. ... Alex Ochoa is
becoming a fixture in the Reds' lineup, especially since he homered
in three consecutive games for the first time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ------
Giants-Astros
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: Former Astros reliever Doug Henry had to find his
way into the visitors' clubhouse this time when the Giants came to
Enron Field. He spent 2&AMP;frac12; years with the Astros before he was dealt
to the Giants this season. ''I managed to find it OK,'' Henry said.
''It feels weird. I have some very good friends (in Houston). It's
nice coming back. I'm happy in San Francisco right now, but I miss
the guys here (Houston).'' ... Russ Ortiz will start against San
Diego on Friday in his first appearance since the Padres snapped
his seven-game winning streak on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: Equaling his club-record 43 home run mark isn't the
number that interests Jeff Bagwell. He'd rather his team be No. 1
in the NL Central. ''That isn't a big deal,'' Bagwell said. ''I hit
43 in 1997 and we won the division. that was fun.''... Moises Alou
entered Wednesday night's game with a .357 average and is
approaching the franchise record of .368 set by Bagwell in his MVP
season of 1994.

<HEADLINE> US Targets Housing Corruption  </HEADLINE>
By JAMES ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Auditors in Washington were
astonished when Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo announced a $130
million settlement of a discrimination suit by Puerto Rico's
housing agency -- despite charges that millions of federal dollars
are misspent, lost or stolen in the nation's second largest housing
program.
</P>
<P>
   Now a U.S. senator is trying to freeze that money ''to make sure
it goes to the people who need it'' -- namely, a quarter million of
Puerto Rico's poor.
</P>
<P>
   ''The deal may have merit. But we want to know how they are
going to spend the money and where it is actually going,'' said
Sen. Christopher Bond, a Missouri Republican whose appropriations
subcommittee oversees the Department of Housing and Urban
Development's budget.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the subcommittee voted to withhold the $130
million until Puerto Rico certifies how it will be spent. ''We
expect (the hold) to go all the way to the White House,'' said Bond
spokesman Ernie Blazar.
</P>
<P>
   HUD spokesman Andrew L. Lluberes insisted the agency ''has zero
tolerance for fraud, waste and abuse'' and ''does not anticipate
any difficulty in satisfying Senator Bond's concerns and, indeed,
has already started on that process.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlement -- announced during a Cuomo visit to Puerto Rico
in June -- capped a $500 million lawsuit charging that for 25 years,
HUD had discriminated against Puerto Rico's housing agency in
calculating its annual operating subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   HUD said the action was approved by the Justice Department ''as
being in the best interests of the United States'' -- and argued it
had nothing to do with ongoing efforts to combat corruption or
improve accounting.
</P>
<P>
   But it stunned HUD auditors, including Inspector General Susan
Gaffney, who complained to Cuomo and filed a separate complaint
about Puerto Rico directly with Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Accusing the local housing authority of ''flagrant fraud, waste
and abuse,'' Gaffney demanded that a federal judge seize control of
the troubled agency. Deputy HUD Secretary Saul N. Ramirez Jr.
insisted that Puerto Rico was improving its accounting and that
judicial receivership wasn't necessary.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation into the alleged embezzlement of $2.5 million
in HUD funds has produced 11 indictments and nine guilty pleas, and
the FBI is conducting its own fraud investigations. A 1998-1999 HUD
audit found $26 million of $39 million in U.S. funds used to pay
contractors was wasted or illegally spent.
</P>
<P>
   The local agency -- second in size to New York City -- has
confronted a host of other problems.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, many residents were virtual captives of heavily
armed drug lords, forcing Puerto Rico's National Guard to seize
control of several projects. Drug-related crime in the projects
accounts for the bulk of Puerto Rico's murder rate -- one of the
highest in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents also live in dangerous conditions with exposed
electric wiring, raw sewage and unsafe playgrounds. HUD has
dispatched teams to ensure repairs are made and monitor accounting
and contracting.
</P>
<P>
   Now the local agency hopes to hang on to its $130 million
settlement. ''Our answer always has been that the cases of fraud
have been reported by the housing authority,'' said agency head
John Blakeman.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 9, Gaffney asked a federal judge to force Puerto Rico to
turn over documents to determine how Puerto Rico paid up to dlrs
625,000 to defend itself against HUD allegations. HUD regulations
forbid the use of federal funds for litigation against the federal
government.

<HEADLINE> Titan's O'Donnell Opts for Comfort  </HEADLINE>
By TERESA M. WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- With a timely off week and one of the
NFL's top backup quarterbacks, the Tennessee Titans are not overly
concerned about Steve McNair's bruised sternum.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans, in perhaps their most important move during the
offseason, kept veteran Neil O'Donnell from signing with anyone
else.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just a huge lift for us,'' tight end Frank Wycheck said.
''I think in this league nowadays you have to have two really
proven starters on your team. Last year Steve goes down, and Neil
picks up the slack, goes 4-1 and was a big, big part of our
championship run.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee (1-1) has a bye this Sunday, and McNair will play on
Sept. 24 at Pittsburgh if possible. But coach Jeff Fisher said
O'Donnell will start if McNair isn't ready.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell proved his worth yet again last weekend, coming into
the game with 6:25 left and rallying the Titans to a 17-14 victory
in overtime over the Kansas City Chiefs after McNair was hit hard
in the chest by the Chiefs' Duane Clemons.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell was 11-of-17 for 132 yards and one touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans nearly lost him to Tampa Bay during the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-year veteran had only a one-year contract with the Titans
for last season, hoping to find a job as a starter. Tampa Bay came
calling, looking for a backup to Shaun King and offering more money
than the Titans.
</P>
<P>
   After all, O'Donnell ranks 12th all-time among NFL quarterbacks
with his passer rating, and he is the NFL's career leader among
active quarterbacks in lowest interception percentage.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't an easy choice.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell was friends with Tampa Bay coach Tony Dungy from their
years together in Pittsburgh, and he had people calling, urging him
to join the Buccaneers.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Leslie, was a big factor in his decision to stay. She
had moved the family from New York in 1998 to Cincinnati and to
Nashville in 1999, and it was a joint decision to remain in
Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell accepted the Titans' three-year contract worth at
least $7.6 million, even though it meant less money.
</P>
<P>
   ''You look at the business-side and the personal/social side,''
O'Donnell said. ''We feel pretty comfortable here. I like the
locker room. I like the players, so let's keep this good thing
going.''
</P>
<P>
   The veteran's performance in rallying the Titans last weekend
started talk on radio shows that McNair should be benched. But
there hasn't been any complaints from O'Donnell or anyone else of a
quarterback controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jeff Fisher credits both O'Donnell and McNair.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their relationship is excellent. You don't realize how well
they work together on the practice field, in the meetings as well
as on the sidelines during the game. Neil understands his role,''
Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell has been through quarterback controversies, and he has
no desire to whip up a problem here.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been at this long enough. I understand all that. It's not
good for the locker room. It's not good for the team. I know it
would make (a reporter's) job easier,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not like that.''

<HEADLINE> Schulters' Return May Help Niners'  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Lance Schulters wants the San
Francisco 49ers' defense to start playing more like he does.
</P>
<P>
   The Pro Bowl safety says the 49ers can begin to solve their
defensive problems by taking risks and being more reckless. It's a
strange prescription for a team as young and inexperienced as the
Niners, but Schulters said it's the only chance San Francisco will
have against Kurt Warner and the St. Louis Rams.
</P>
<P>
   After missing the first two games of the season because of a
sprained left ankle, Schulters plans to lead by example when San
Francisco travels to St. Louis on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We aren't going to play scared this week,'' Schulters said.
''We keep harping on the deep ball, but we've got to forget the
deep ball. We've got to take chances and not worry about giving up
a big play. In this league, you can't play the way we've been
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Schulters spent most of Wednesday's practice resting
on the sidelines and coach Steve Mariucci said a final decision
hadn't been made, Schulters said he'll play against the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   ''By game time, I should be close to 100 percent,'' Schulters
said. ''I can cut and break a little better than I could (while
recovering from a similar injury) last year.''
</P>
<P>
   His return would be the first good news in a long while for a
defense that's last in the NFL in points allowed (74), total yards
allowed (809) and passing yards allowed (616). Sunday's game
matches that league-worst defense against the NFL's best offense.
</P>
<P>
   Ever the optimist, Mariucci called the game ''an excellent
test'' for the 49ers' painfully young defense, particularly a
secondary that featured just five healthy players at the end of
Sunday's 38-22 loss to Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Schulters, backup cornerback Zack Bronson didn't
practice Wednesday while recuperating from a stinger suffered on
Sunday. Starting cornerback Monty Montgomery was on crutches
earlier this week but is expected to play as well.
</P>
<P>
   But the 49ers' defensive problems are likely to continue all
season long, regardless of which players are healthy. With one of
the league's youngest rosters and a complete inability to sign
significant free agents because of salary cap constraints, the
49ers have no choice but to rebuild their once-proud defense.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coordinator Jim Mora chuckled when he remembered a
sequence against Carolina in which the 49ers fielded eight
defenders who were playing in their second pro game.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you look at the big picture, you say this is exactly what
we need,'' Mora said. ''The only way they're going to get better is
to play. It's an opportunity that a lot of young players don't
get.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rams, who Mariucci called ''the fastest team ever assembled
on a football field,'' frequently use plays featuring four wide
receivers. That means rookie cornerbacks Ahmed Plummer and Jason
Webster, rookie safety John Keith, second-year safety Pierson
Prioleau and second-year cornerback Anthony Parker all will be on
the field a great deal on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pressure is what makes rough stones into diamonds,'' Webster
said. ''They have great talent, but we can't allow it to rattle
us.''

<HEADLINE> Task force to address violent crime  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UTICA, N.Y. (AP) - After the fifth shooting in six days, city
and county law enforcement officials announced Wednesday they will
form a Major Crimes Investigations Unit to combat violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Early Wednesday morning, police said a soured drug deal led to
the shooting of a man and the arrest of another, bringing to eight
the number of people shot in the city since Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The new task force will be patterned after a federal/state/local
Utica Arson Strike Force formed in 1997 after a series of Cornhill
and East Utica fires, said Oneida County District Attorney Michael
A. Arcuri.
</P>
<P>
   He said the task force will investigate shootings, homicides,
rape and other violent crimes. Planning for the new unit should be
complete within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The task forced is formed in the face of criticism by some in
the community who say the city has acted slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I support this task force and I hope it will eliminate drug
dealers and put an end to these shootings,'' said Councilman Howard
Welch.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Minister Doubts Arafat  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Heading into an other round of ''incredibly
difficult'' negotiations, Israel's foreign minister questioned
Wednesday whether Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was ready to
take courageous decisions for peace.
</P>
<P>
   On the day the Palestinians were to have declared statehood, the
Clinton administration announced a new effort to break a deadlock
with separate talks with Israeli and Palestinian officials.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami said the
negotiations ''were incredibly difficult but also promising'' and
said Israel would do its very best to produce a settlement with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech marking Israel's newly won eligibility for the U.N.
Security Council, Ben-Ami said of Arafat: ''It is still an enigma
whether the courage is there for the Palestinian leader to make the
extra mile.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the foreign minister met at the White House with Sandy
Berger, President Clinton's national security adviser, and said he
was ''doubtful about the prospects of success.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ben-Ami accepted a hurriedly arranged invitation from
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright for dinner Thursday while the
Palestinians dispatched top negotiators to New York for separate
talks with her.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to try and give it a chance,'' Ben-Ami said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, meanwhile, said ''the obstacles remain daunting.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the Conference of Presidents of Major American
Jewish Organizations, Albright said ''the unprecedented progress''
made at the Camp David summit in July was due to Prime Minister
Ehud Barak's ''courage and vision.''
</P>
<P>
   The occasion for the speeches was a ceremony marking Israel's
acceptance in the West European group at the United Nations. This
will give Israel a chance it has never had because of an Arab
boycott to serve in rotation with European countries on the
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Lauder, president of the Jewish group, said ''no other
nation in the world was denied its rightful role'' and that Israel
still suffered discrimination in the world organization.
</P>
<P>
   Ben-Ami and Gilad Sher, a specialist on Palestinian issues, met
with Berger as the Clinton administration refused to abandon its
drive to fashion a compromise on the future of Jerusalem and on
other key issues, even with the passing of Wednesday's deadline for
a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Ben-Ami also took up with Berger promises by the administration
to improve Israel's strategic capabilities. He said U.S. assistance
should not be contingent on whether or not an agreement is reached
with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   He also called on the international community to make a strong
statement of support for peacemaking and said the Palestinians were
''regressing'' in their positions since Clinton hosted a summit
with Barak and Arafat at Camp David in July.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians have made similar complaints about Israel's
stand.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo called
Albright's invitation to send negotiators to New York ''a
surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   He said negotiators Saeb Erekat and Mohammed Dahlan would be
there on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's excellent news,'' U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
said in New York Wednesday night of the resumption of talks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton failed to break the deadlock over control of holy sites
in Jerusalem in separate meetings with Arafat and Barak in New York
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians were poised to declare independence Wednesday, the
seventh anniversary of the signing of the first Israel-Palestinian
accord, but put it off to give the talks another chance.
</P>
<P>
   Israel suggested a solution to a territorial issue -- a bridge
over Israel to link the West Bank and Gaza in exchange for Israeli
annexation of parts of the West Bank where most Jewish settlers
live.
</P>
<P>
   Ben-Ami said Israel insists on overall sovereignty on the Temple
Mount, known to Muslims as Haram as-Sharif, the Noble Sanctuary.
Ben-Ami said the two sides must ''find some kind of accommodation
that will respect the needs of everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to counter Palestinian concerns that Israel excavate
under the Muslim shrines to uncover the ruins of the Temples,
Ben-Ami told the Al-Ayam newspaper, ''We will obviously take all
commitments not to dig, all international guarantees necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Nabil Aburdeneh, an aide to Arafat, rejected compromise.
''Jerusalem is a Palestinian city, and it should be under full
Palestinian sovereignty,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Jet Gastineau Gets Jail Sentence  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Former Jets star Mark Gastineau was sentenced
Wednesday to 18 months in jail for failing to complete an
anger-management course after hitting his estranged wife.
</P>
<P>
   Gastineau admitted in May that he had violated terms of his
probation following a guilty plea to misdemeanor assault in October
1998. So, he was ordered to spend a year in a treatment center but
left after about four months, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Gastineau's lawyer, Sharyn Stein, asked the judge to give the
former defensive lineman another chance to straighten out his life.
''He's a changed man,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Manhattan criminal court Judge A. Kirke Bartley told
Gastineau, ''I have given you beyond a second and third chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Gastineau immediately began serving his sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The problems grew out of Gastineau's flouting of a 1998 court
order of protection to stay away from his estranged wife, Patricia
Schorr.
</P>
<P>
   She obtained the order after the 6-foot-5 Gastineau, who was 270
pounds during his football career, hit her and threatened her with
a glass cocktail table.
</P>
<P>
   In April this year, Bartley ordered Gastineau to spend a year at
the Hope Christian Center, a Bronx treatment facility. If he failed
to finish the program, the judge said, Gastineau was ''surely''
going to jail.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 22, the 43-year-old Gastineau walked away from the
program after threatening another resident, Assistant District
Attorney Angela Albertus said. In court Wednesday, she reminded the
judge of his warning to the former football star.
</P>
<P>
   Gastineau, who played for the Jets for 10 years and retired in
1988, had previously been found guilty of assault in 1984 and was
sentenced to three years' probation in 1993 on drug charges.

<HEADLINE> Greek Cypriot Leader Skips UN Talks  </HEADLINE>
By ALEX EFTY
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Angered by a statement from the U.N.
chief, Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides boycotted the second day
of U.N.-sponsored talks on reunifying Cyprus on Wednesday and gave
no indication he would return Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Clerides was upset by a statement from U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan that the Greek Cypriots see as favoring the breakaway
Turkish Cypriot state, said Cyprus government spokesman Michalis
Papapetrou.
</P>
<P>
   Clerides sent Annan a letter ''expressing his interpretation and
views in connection with the statement issued by the
secretary-general yesterday,'' Papapetrou said.
</P>
<P>
   While Clerides spent the day away from U.N. headquarters,
Turkish Cypriot leader Raouf Denktash, who had welcomed Annan's
statement, met as planned with Annan's special adviser on Cyprus,
Alvaro de Soto.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a happy day,'' a beaming Denktash told reporters on
arrival at U.N. Headquarters on Wednesday. After a 75-minute
meeting with de Soto, Denktash said he would return Thursday for
more talks, without revealing what was discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Annan had told the rival Cypriot leaders by letter that the time
had come for them to move toward reunification of their war-divided
island.
</P>
<P>
   The Greek Cypriots were upset by the statement, which they
interpreted as a shift in the U.N. position, equating the
internationally recognized Cyprus government of Clerides with the
breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the Turkish-occupied northern
part of the island.
</P>
<P>
   The Turkish Cypriot state is recognized only by Turkey, which
maintains 35,000 troops there.
</P>
<P>
   The Mediterranean island has been divided since 1974.

<HEADLINE> Tigers' Palmer Ejected, 4th Inning  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Detroit Tigers third baseman Dean Palmer was
ejected in the fourth inning Wednesday night for arguing a called
third strike by home plate umpire Chris Guccione.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer was called out on a 2-2 pitch from Chicago's Jim Parque
to end the inning. Palmer stared at Guccione, started to walk to
the dugout and then threw his helmet in disgust.
</P>
<P>
   Guccione signaled that Palmer was ejected and the third baseman
ran over to argue. Detroit manager Phil Garner stepped in to
separate the two, and third base coach Doug Mansolino had to
restrain Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's Juan Gonzalez argued with Guccione over a called third
strike in the first inning.

<HEADLINE> Knight Delivers Farewell Speech  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE HERMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- Bob Knight bid farewell to Indiana
University, saluting cheering students and urging them to forget
about the freshman who played a part in the coach's firing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let that kid be a student and let him get on with life,''
Knight said Wednesday night. ''This thing, believe me, had happened
to me long before that situation took place. That kid is not
responsible for my not coaching at Indiana, and make sure you
understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   The peaceful crowd at Dunn Meadow was estimated by police at
about 6,000. Some students watched from the roof of a fraternity
house across the street. Others climbed trees that ringed the
meadow, the site of many campus protests in the 1960s and '70s.
Many hoisted signs of support for Knight, who was fired Sunday for
violating a zero-tolerance behavior policy imposed by university
president Myles Brand.
</P>
<P>
   Knight never mentioned Brand by name, and he took only a few
brief jabs at the administration in his 20-minute talk.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a great university,'' he said. ''Trustees,
administrations, faculties change ... but this university has
really stood the test of time, because the really good people that
take care of you in the classroom and in every other way far
outnumber the people that have agendas that don't involve the
students first of all.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight was fired three days after he grabbed and berated
freshman Kent Harvey, who had called out, 'Hey, what's up,
Knight?'' a greeting Knight regarded as disrespectful.
</P>
<P>
   Several players threatened to transfer after Knight was fired,
but all of them decided to remain when assistant Mike Davis, who
had recruited many of them, was selected interim coach by athletic
director Clarence Doninger on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Knight urged the students to continue supporting the team and
the new coach.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you go into Assembly Hall for the first game this year, I
want you to remember what your moms and dads, your brothers and
sisters, your aunts and uncles and friends that have been in those
seats before you have meant to our basketball team. And I want you
to mean the same thing to this basketball team,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''People change over the years, and that changes situations, for
good and for bad, but don't let the student body, the energy, the
enthusiasm the student body has had for basketball, please don't
let that change. If you want to do something to remember me by, do
that. Continue the same energy, the same enthusiasm the students
before you have given to basketball. I'll be very proud of you for
doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   A university spokesman called it ''an awfully gracious speech.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Students have always been important to him, and I'm glad they
got to see him tonight,'' IU vice president Christopher Simpson
said. ''Twenty-nine years is a long time. There were some highs and
lows, but I certainly didn't take offense at anything he said.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither did the students, who greeted Knight with applause and
cheers as he approached the platform at the edge of Dunn Meadow and
then kissed his wife, Karen, as she dabbed her eyes with tissue.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope that's not inappropriate physical contact,'' Karen
Knight said, drawing laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Tom Geyer called the kiss ''the most touching part'' of
Knight's appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ''People don't see that side of coach. It's just sad that they
had to wait until now,'' Geyer said.
</P>
<P>
   One banner in the crowd read ''Free 29 years of IU junk,'' but
most signs supported Knight:
</P>
<P>
   ''Politics + a punk + cowards  railroading of a great man'' ...
''Career victories, Knight: 763, Brand/Doninger: 0'' ... ''Bring
back Bobby'' ... ''My degree is from Knight school.''
</P>
<P>
   Colin Banta, 19, a freshman from Griffith, said Knight made his
point with the administration ''in a subtle way. ... To most people
here, they would have been on his side no matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   David Smuckler, 18, a freshman from St. Louis, said Knight
conducted himself ''better than he normally does. ... It was a good
way to say goodbye to Indiana.''
</P>
<P>
   Meghan Felicelli, 20, a junior from St. Paul, Minn., said she
was pleased Knight didn't use the speech to justify his actions.
''He wished us the best of luck and asked us to do the same for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Julia Gilham, 18, a freshman from Indianapolis, said she was not
a fan of Knight but came to the rally ''because it's like history
in the making ... because IU basketball is such a huge tradition.''

   ''Everybody who would like to slap her, raise your hand.'' -
Arthur Deruve, 66, of Yonkers, watching the debate at the Sons of
Italy Lodge in White Plains, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ''He won by a mile. He put her on the spot with that soft money
pledge. She wanted to crawl into the nearest hole. It was
especially great because expectations for her were really high.'' -
James Cavanaugh, chairman of the Westchester County GOP Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that she did better than he did. She answered
questions without ducking them like he did. She tried to be
ladylike, intelligent, and bright, and she was.'' - John Burns Sr.,
former state Democratic chairman, 1965-1971.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that Mrs. Clinton overall made a better showing. I

very evasive.'' - Craig Goldstein of New Paltz, N.Y., registered as
an Independent and undecided on who he will vote for.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think she's exceptionally bright. She's a far better debater
but she has a long way to go before she convinces me to vote for
her.'' - Phyllis Granat, an undecided voter from Manhasset, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Hillary won. She has the specifics, she's got a plan,
Lazio was so vague. He would not touch anything Hillary said
because he had nothing. ... She stuck with her husband so she'll
stick to any promise she makes.'' - Jojie Sperrazza, 54, a Clinton

<HEADLINE> Excerpts from the Clinton-Lazio debate  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Here are excerpts from the
debate Wednesday
between U.S. Senate candidates Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rep. Rick
Lazio.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Question: Clinton is shown a video clip of her January 1998
appearance on NBC's ''Today'' show in which she said President
Clinton had not been involved with Monica Lewinsky and accused a
''vast right wing conspiracy'' of trying to destroy his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do you regret misleading the American people?''
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON: ''That was a very painful time for me, for my family,
and for our country. It is something that I regret deeply that
anyone had to go through. ... I'm very hopeful that we can go
forward in a united way. That certainly is what I've tried to do.
And I've tried to be as forthcoming as I could given the
circumstances that I faced.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, I didn't mislead anyone. I didn't know the truth.
And there's a great deal of pain associated with that, and my
husband has certainly acknowledged that and made it clear that he
did mislead the country as well as his family.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: ''In trying to unite people, however, is it appropriate to
brand anyone who criticized the president as part of a vast right
wing conspiracy?''
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON: ''I certainly didn't mean to extend that to anyone who
might criticize the president, especially after the truth came out.
You know I have the greatest respect for Sen. (Joseph) Lieberman,
(a vocal critic of the president). ... But I think there is strong
opposition within the country to the vision that I share with many
about what we'd like to do for our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: ''In your response, Mr. Lazio, would you also address your
fundraising letter of July 2000, where you said the first lady
embarrassed our country?''
</P>
<P>
   LAZIO: ''I stand by that fundraising letter. I stand by that
statement.''
</P>
<P>
   ''What's so troubling here with respect to what my opponent just
said is somehow that it only matters what you say when you get
caught. And character and trust is about well more than that. And
blaming others every time you have responsibility, unfortunately
that's become a pattern, I think, for my opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   -------------------
</P>
<P>
   Q: Lazio is asked if a vote against a bill that would have
allowed patients to sue health insurance companies showed he was
more loyal to the Republican House leadership than to New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   LAZIO: ''I don't think anybody can rationally say that. ... In
fact, if you look at my record, it's a record of independence in
the House.''
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON: ''Listening to the congressman's response reminds me of
a word I've heard a lot of this past year, chutzpah. He stands
there and tells us that he's a moderate, mainstream, independent
member of Congress. Well, in fact, he was a deputy whip to Newt
Gingrich, he voted to shut the government down. ..... Time and time
again, when he's had a choice to make ... he's stood with the
Republican leadership and Newt Gingrich.''
</P>
<P>
   -------------------
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON: ''Talking about the issues is something that he's not
very comfortable about, because he does have these votes and this
record, not just back when you were deputy whip to Newt Gingrich,
but in the last year or two.''
</P>
<P>
   LAZIO: ''It's beyond shameless, I guess. The tactic of naming a
bunch of things and knowing that I don't have enough time to answer
all of them is just positively Clintonesque.''
</P>
<P>
   ''... Newt Gingrich is not running. If you had a record, I
suppose, you wouldn't need to use Newt Gingrich. I'm running. And I
have a strong New York record.''
</P>
<P>
   -------------------
</P>
<P>
   LAZIO: (after Clinton described her ideas on education).
</P>
<P>
   ''I agree that Mrs. Clinton has got a record on education, and
it's a disaster. She was responsible for educational changes in
Arkansas, and you know what happened? Spending went up, taxes went
up and student performance went down ... I don't think we need that
Little Rock record in the Big Apple.''
</P>
<P>
   -------------------
</P>
<P>
   Q: ''Will both of you set an example for the rest of the country
and renounce the use of soft money ads for the rest of this
campaign?''
</P>
<P>
   LAZIO: ''Absolutely. ... I have right here a pledge that I sent
over to my opponent. It's a 'ban on soft money' pledge. I'm willing
to say I will neither raise nor spend a dime of soft money, and ask
all outside groups to stay away if my opponent is willing to do the
same.''
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON: ''Back in May, I made exactly that offer. ... If you
will get signed agreements from all your friends, who say they're
raising $32 million, and will not be running so-called independent
ads, will not be doing push-polling, will not be doing mass
mailings that are filled with these outrageous personal attacks, I
think we can have an agreement. I'd like to see those signed
letters.''
</P>
<P>
   LAZIO: ''I want to get it done right now, I don't want any more
wiggle room, I don't want any more evasions. ... Let's just get
this deal done right now. Right here. Here it is. Let's sign it,
it's the New York Freedom from Soft Money Pact. I signed it. ... We
will make sure it's an iron-clad deal.''
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON: ''I admire that. That was a wonderful performance.
...''
</P>
<P>
   LAZIO: ''Why don't you sign it? I'm not asking you to admire it,
I'm asking you to sign it.''
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON: ''Well, I would be happy to when you give me the signed
letters.''
</P>
<P>
   LAZIO: ''Right here, right here. Sign it right now. (He leaves
his podium and walks across the stage to Clinton, handing her a
sheet of paper.)
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON: ''We'll shake on it.'' (They shake hands.)
</P>
<P>
   LAZIO: ''No, I want your signature. Everybody wants to see you
sign something that you said you were for. (He points to the
pledge.) ... Why don't you show some leadership, because it goes to
trust and character.''

<HEADLINE> Debate was proving ground for Senate candidates  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Trying to show that he's not just a
babyfaced un-Hillary, Rep. Rick Lazio went on the attack against
the first lady in their first debate Wednesday, wielding
soundbite-sized insults and an actual prop in his hand.
</P>
<P>
   NBC spokeswoman Barb Levin said Lazio violated an agreement both
campaigns had made not to use props when he produced a contract
that would ban the use of unregulated donations. Lazio left his
podium and strode over to Hillary Rodham Clinton's side of the
stage with the contract in his hand as he repeatedly asked her to
sign the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   She said she would only sign it if he got agreements from the
Republican committees that have been sending out letters and
producing TV ads attacking her on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   While the exchange appeared dramatic on TV, with the two
candidates interrupting each other and Lazio shoving the paper in
front of Clinton's face, the studio audience regarded it as a light
moment, laughing nervously as they watched to see how Clinton would
respond.
</P>
<P>
   ''People got to see for themselves that it was a trick for the
TV camera,'' said Ann Lewis, one of Clinton's campaign advisers.
</P>
<P>
   But Lazio campaign manager Bill Dal Col defended the gimmick,
saying, ''It was time to stop the Clinton shuffle.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also did plenty of attacking of her own, repeatedly
tarring Lazio with Newt Gingrich's name, while Lazio turned the
tables and accused her of being ''Clintonesque.'' The two
candidates also accused the other of having ''chutzpah.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Miringoff, head of the Poughkeepsie-based Marist Institute
for Public Opinion, described the debate as being ''very combative
... This was really rough stuff. They were in your face the whole
time.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they decided there weren't a lot of undecided voters.
They weren't trying to convert people that weren't supporting
them,'' he told WNBC-TV. ''What they were trying to do ... was
reinforce their base.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a Marist poll showed voters nearly evenly divided in
their support, with 50 percent going for Clinton and 47 percent
supporting Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Bob McClure, a Syracuse University political science professor,
said ''Hillary had to prove she didn't have horns. Rick had to
prove he had something between his ears. And both of them came out
of the debate with something.''
</P>
<P>
   McClure said Lazio took a risk by confronting Clinton with the
soft money contract.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has to show he can stand up to her, that he's a person of
principle and substance,'' McClure said. ''At the same time, he
takes the risk of potentially looking churlish and aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio appeared to have been prepped with numerous snappy
one-liners. When Clinton's health care debacle was mentioned, Lazio
said: ''A New Yorker would never have made that proposal. In New
York, we say you gotta tell it like it is.''
</P>
<P>
   In a ''spin'' room set up just outside the auditorium,
representatives from both campaigns stood at podiums and
highlighted their candidates' performance to reporters after the
event. But the spinning began long before the debate. The Clinton
campaign distributed a ''Special Debate Pre-Buttal'' attacking
Lazio, and Lazio staffers distributed e-mails and memos throughout
the debate to dozens of reporters watching it in on large-screen
TVs at the site.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, for her part, tried to seem likable, twice taking
precious seconds from her speaking time to thank the organizers of
the debate, and once asking a member of the audience who had
submitted a question to identify himself so she could personally
address him.
</P>
<P>
   She also briefly reincarnated herself as the victimized wife of
a philandering husband, blinking, swallowing and stammering a
response to a question about why she misled the country by
initially denying that President Clinton had an affair.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't mislead anyone,'' she said quietly. ''I didn't know
the truth. There's a great deal of pain associated with that.''
</P>
<P>
   McClure said Clinton ''handled that well ... It actually served
to advance her own standing.''
</P>
<P>
   About 240 people - including 40 guests from each campaign -
attended the debate, which was moderated by Buffalo native Tim
Russert, host of NBC's ''Meet the Press'' and held in the studios
of Buffalo's public television station, WNED-TV.
</P>
<P>
   After the debate was over, Lazio celebrated his wife Pat's 40th
birthday with a cake and party at a nearby hotel. To the cheers of
about 200 guests, Lazio said: ''We New Yorkers don't back down from
a fight.''

<HEADLINE> Canoe-Kayaker To Carry Olympic Flag  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY SIDDONS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Cliff Meidl, who survived a 30,000-volt
jolt of electricity in a construction accident and became one of
America's top sprint kayakers, was picked to carry the U.S. flag
into the opening ceremony at the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Meidl, 34, from Redondo Beach, Calif., was chosen Thursday
(Wednesday night EDT) in a vote of the U.S. squad from a list that
also included Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong, soccer player
Brandi Chastain and swimmer Dara Torres.
</P>
<P>
   He will lead the largest team at the games, more than 600
strong, into the ceremony at the 110,000-seat Olympic Stadium
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an incredible honor,'' Meidl said. ''I am so proud and
honored to be able to represent the USA and to lead the entire
delegation into the stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Meidl was a 20-year-old plumber's apprentice in 1986 and working
a jackhammer in a large hole when he cut through three unmarked
high-voltage cables. The charge was 15 times that of an electric
chair and lifted him out of the hole, blowing off toes, cracking
open his skull and burning his back.
</P>
<P>
   ''I then slid back into the hole with my knees in direct contact
with the jackhammer,'' Meidl said. ''I was brought back to life
once right after the initial shock.
</P>
<P>
   ''I went into cardiac arrest again on the ambulance ride to the
hospital, and then again once I was at the hospital. The next thing
I remember is waking up in the hospital 10 hours later. My chest
felt like it had been run over by a truck from all the CPR they had
to perform.''
</P>
<P>
   His knees were so badly injured doctors wanted to amputate his
legs, but Meidl's parent refused. A plastic surgeon was brought in
to transplant muscles from his calves to his knees, one of 15
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ''They didn't think I would walk again,'' he said. ''But I was
determined. I was on crutches for most of three years, enduring
many, many surgeries.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by Greg Barton, a double gold-medalist in kayak at the
1988 Games who was born with club feet, Meidl took up the sport to
help his rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   It worked. Meidl was a member of the Olympic team in 1996 and
last year won the K-2 category at the Olympic trials. He also
finished third in K-1 at an international regatta at Bratislava,
Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still can't run or ski,'' he said. ''But I can walk and I
can paddle. I don't take things for granted anymore, and I
definitely believe in nine lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Meidl is the first canoe-kayaker picked as U.S. flagbearer. The
alternate flagbearer is hammer thrower Lance Deal.

<HEADLINE> Senate Passes Rural Forest Aid Bill  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN HUGHES
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal aid for schools and roads in hundreds
of rural counties would increase by $222 million next year under a
bill approved by the Senate Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The bill by Sens. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, and Ron Wyden, D-Ore.,
changes the formula for distributing aid to counties that have
tax-exempt federal forest land within county boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1908 law, counties with federal forests nearby receive
25 percent of the revenue generated from the forests, mostly from
logging.
</P>
<P>
   But as logging on federal land declined by nearly 80 percent in
the last decade, so did the aid for many rural counties. Rural
school officials were forced to lay off teachers, cut back programs
and cancel equipment purchases.
</P>
<P>
   The Craig-Wyden bill increases and stabilizes the payments to
counties by tying the annual aid amount to a three-year average of
the highest forest payments between 1986 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the payments would come from the U.S. Treasury
regardless of how much timber is cut on federal land, though some
of the aid would still be tied to forest revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ''This legislation is about not abandoning rural America,''
Wyden said after the Senate approved the bill by unanimous consent.
</P>
<P>
   County aid would go from $273 million in 1999 to $495 million
next year, under the bill.
</P>
<P>
   At least some counties in all 50 states receive aid under the
92-year-old program, though most of the money goes to the West.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon would be the biggest beneficiary, with about $260 million
in aid next year, followed by California, with $65 million,
Washington state, with $44 million, and Idaho, with nearly $23
million.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration favors the Senate bill. ''We applaud
the Senate,'' said Chris Wood, a top aide to Forest Service Chief
Mike Dombeck, after Wednesday's Senate approval.
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials oppose a version of the bill passed
by the House last November, saying that version -- among other
things -- encourages logging.
</P>
<P>
   Senators hope to get the House to agree to the Senate version
with few, if any, changes before Congress adjourns for the year
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists opposed provisions in both bills that allow
counties to use up to 20 percent of the federal aid to develop
joint county-federal projects on federal land such as tourism and
road maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   The activists complained that most local projects would focus on
one of the biggest money makers -- logging.
</P>
<P>
   But Craig, Wyden and Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., reached a
compromise with some Democratic colleagues who had environmental
concerns about the bill.
</P>
<P>
   They crafted language that would have proceeds from the county
projects go to the Treasury, not to the counties, and they expanded
the scope of projects allowed under to include more conservation
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a true bipartisan, team effort,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the roles Smith played was to intervene when Sen. Don
Nickles, R-Okla., temporarily held the Craig-Wyden bill hostage as
part of a fight Wyden and Nickles have been having over
physician-assisted suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know of a bill that has had me in more hallway
meetings and pleadings than this one,'' Smith said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Vt's Flanagan is Gay Senate Nominee  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURLINGTON, Vt. (AP) -- In a state clearly divided over its
landmark law allowing civil unions for gay couples, a Democratic
state auditor has become the nation's first openly gay major-party
U.S. Senate nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Flanagan said Wednesday he was proud to be a leader in
the gay-rights movement, but added, ''I am asking Vermonters not to
waste a single vote either for me or against me because of my
private life.''
</P>
<P>
   Flanagan, who narrowly defeated state Sen. Jan Backus in
Tuesday's primary, has been low-key about his sexuality since
making it public five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But he was active in encouraging state lawmakers last winter to
pass Vermont's first-in-the-nation civil unions law, which granted
the rights and responsibilities of marriage to same-sex couples.
</P>
<P>
   In listing problems he would fight to redress, Flanagan cited 45
million Americans without health insurance and the difficulty many
elderly Americans have affording prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The political consensus within the beltway that things are
just fine is not in touch with the reality that exists here in
Vermont and across the country,'' Flanagan said.
</P>
<P>
   Flanagan faces a fall campaign that could create a dilemma for
some gay and lesbian activists.
</P>
<P>
   Two-term incumbent James Jeffords, a Republican, has been among
the senators most supportive of gay issues. He wrote the bill that
created the Ryan White Fund, which provides assistance to people
with AIDS, and currently is the lead sponsor of a bill to outlaw
employment discrimination based on sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffords also chairs the Senate Health, Education, Labor and
Pensions committee, which has jurisdiction over many of those
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''The voters in Vermont have a difficult choice and an
embarrassment of riches,'' said Winnie Stachelberg, political
director of the Washington-based Human Rights Campaign. ''It's an
example I hope we see in other states in the coming years.''
</P>
<P>
   Divisions over the civil unions law also created voter backlash
that ousted six state legislators -- five Republicans who supported
the law and one Democrat who opposed it. Not all went quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kinsey, a lawmaker in the state House for 30 years, was
soundly defeated in the Republican primary but won a write-in
campaign among Democrats. He said Wednesday he would accept the
nomination.

<HEADLINE> Wednesday's Canada News Briefs  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressNative Women Occupy New Brunswick Fisheries Office
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURNT CHURCH, New Brunswick (AP) -- About 30 native women and
children occupied a federal Fisheries Department office for 2&AMP;frac12;
hours Wednesday, demanding the return of seized lobster traps.
</P>
<P>
   The natives from the Burnt Church reserve entered the office in
nearby Tracadie-Sheila and asked the secretaries for the traps the
department seized over the past five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to get our traps one way or the other,'' said
Martina Parker, one of the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Fisheries officers confiscated at least 2,000 traps, roughly 10
boats and arrested dozens of people on fisheries violations and
criminal charges in the weeks since the latest hostilities began on
Miramichi Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Under a band management plan, every man, woman and child in
Burnt Church is entitled to four lobster traps.
</P>
<P>
   The natives occupying the office were told they had to fill out
forms claiming ownership of the traps, then wait a month to get
them back. The catch is that anyone who claims ownership could be
charged with illegal fishing.
</P>
<P>
   Most ended up signing and left peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   Protester Gail Paul said the band badly needs the equipment to
keep fishing.
</P>
<P>
   ''We stand by our treaty rights,'' she said.

Stephen Lewis Raises Plight of Kidnapped Sudan Kids
</P>
<P>
   WINNIPEG, Manatoba (AP) -- Put the lives of children ahead of
oil, Canada's former ambassador to the United Nations urged world
leaders Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Lewis told an international conference on war-affected
children the world must force the government of Sudan to free
thousands of children being held in the country by a Ugandan rebel
group.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every single day that we pretend that moral suasion is the
answer is another day carved out of the life of a child,'' Lewis
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The numbers are not that large, the villains are clear, it's
the perfect test.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there cannot be agreement on a policy ... so that
eventually the government of Sudan capitulates and the children are
returned, then this conference risks and warrants a cynical
judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   It's estimated 6,000 children are being held in camps in Sudan
by the Lord's Resistance Army, which is battling the Ugandan
government. Although it claims fundamentalist Christian principles,
the LRA kidnaps and forces children to fight in its army on pain of
death.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy has made saving the
kidnapped children a priority, although he has faced criticism for
allowing Sudan's foreign minister to attend the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Axworthy has said that under Canadian legislation, he cannot
take any action against Talisman unless there is international
agreement.

Videotron Agrees To Quebecor Takeover
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- A brand-new multimedia group is about to join
the majors in Canada after Groupe Videotron said Wednesday it has
agreed to be taken over by Quebecor Inc. for about $4.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Videotron, Quebec's largest cable TV operator, also said it has
broken off its merger agreement with Rogers Communications and paid
the Toronto cable and cellphone giant the required $241 million
breakup fee.
</P>
<P>
   Videotron's controlling shareholders, the Chagnon family, have
entered into a lockup agreement with Quebecor and its partner the
Caisse de depot to tender their stake in Videotron. The company
also said the parties have agreed to stop all court actions over
the future of Videotron and reached an out of court settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The deal ends nearly seven months of wrangling that had pitted
Quebecor -- one of Canada's multimedia powerhouses -- and the Caisse,
the country's largest pension fund, against Rogers, a deep-pocketed
company well connected to Canada's financial center on Toronto's
Bay Street.
</P>
<P>
   Under Wednesday's deal, Quebecor and Caisse-owned Capital
Communications will make a new or revised all cash takeover bid, at
the same price of $45 a share that it made in August. The offer
will expire three weeks after its mailing.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first responsibility of managers and directors of public
companies is to maximize value for all shareholders,'' Andre
Chagnon, chairman, and son Claude, chief executive, said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''On that score, we are happy of what we have accomplished.''

<HEADLINE> School Employee Fakes News Release  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GADSDEN, Ala. (AP) -- A school employee says he created and
disseminated a bogus White House news release heralding his
teen-age daughter's volunteerism and sent it to media outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hanvey's daughter, a high school junior, was honored for
volunteerism from the President's Student Service Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   She received a packet that included a certificate, form letter
and a lapel pin, said Robin Blaine, the program's executive
director.
</P>
<P>
   ''What she did was probably really good,'' Blaine said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Blaine said she told Hanvey to retract the news
release after being notified of its contents, which appeared in at
least one newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, we don't condone anyone improperly using the White
House image,'' said Jason Schechter, a White House spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Hanvey, trade industrial education coordinator for the Gadsden
school system, said the incident was ''the worst mistake of my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   The fake release included a picture doctored to look as if
President Clinton handed her the award. It also quoted the girl's
remarks, implying that she delivered a speech.

<HEADLINE> Martinez: Indians' Fans Were Rough  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- As if there wasn't enough bad blood between
Pedro Martinez and the Cleveland Indians, now this.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez revealed on Wednesday that as he got ready to pitch in
relief for the Boston Red Sox during Game 5 of the AL playoffs at
Jacobs Field last October, he was showered with racial slurs by
some fans and received one death threat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I remember being told when I was warming up, 'You're going to
be shot,''' Martinez told Boston reporters. ''They were calling me
'beaner' and saying, 'Go back to your country -- you don't belong in
this country.' That came from fans who probably just wanted me to
get out of there.
</P>
<P>
   ''They said so (much) discriminating stuff to me, it would sound
unreal. It was the first time I ever heard such things and I heard
them here in Cleveland.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the second time in three years that a pitcher has accused
fans sitting in the right-field corner in Cleveland of verbally
taunting them during the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto's David Wells, then with the New York Yankees, said
Indians fans sitting near the visitors' bullpen made vulgar remarks
to him before Game 5 of the ALCS in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez managed to block out the crowd and pitched six no-hit
innings last October as the Red Sox completed their improbable
comeback from a 2-0 deficit to beat the Indians and advance.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez dismissed the taunts as fans caught up in the
excitement of rooting for the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's normal in sports to have your fans in your hometown get
on the visiting players. That's how I take it. They just said some
things because they knew I could probably beat up on the Cleveland
Indians,'' Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't pay attention. I would just say those were the crazy
fans with a lot to drink and who knows what else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez has owned the Indians throughout his career, going 8-0
with a 1.47 ERA, including two wins in last year's playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez never mentioned the taunting last October or in April
when he pitched at Jacobs Field earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, he'll make his first start at Cleveland since
April 30, when he was ejected for hitting Indians second baseman
Roberto Alomar.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was suspended for five games for hitting Alomar in the
backside after he was warned by umpires not to retaliate after
Cleveland's Charles Nagy hit Boston's Jose Offerman.
</P>
<P>
   Nagy hit Offerman after Martinez twice buzzed the head of
Indians catcher Einar Diaz, who hit two doubles off last year's AL
Cy Young winner.
</P>
<P>
   With so much riding on these games, Martinez isn't anticipating
any more trouble between the teams.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think I did anything for them to react at that time,''
he said. ''They chose to take some measures in the game and we just
responded.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said he spoke with Alomar at the All-Star game in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ''(Alomar) said it was the right thing to do when I did it and I
did it right,'' Martinez said. ''He came over to the weight room
(Monday) and he was like always. We hugged each other, we talked,
just like always. He understands.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Indians don't have anything against us. We just did what
we had to do, both teams. It's over with. Those games are over
with. It's a new game tomorrow. Nothing will happen, hopefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said he's not worried any hostility from the fans,
either, as the Red Sox chase the Indians for the wild card spot.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only thing the crowd can do is go crazy out there,'' he
said. ''They can never jump into the field. I don't care what the
crowd does -- not there, not at Yankee Stadium or at Fenway.
Nowhere. Fans are out there to have fun and watch.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm inside the field to do my thing. I don't care what they do
or how they feel. I just care about my game and give them what they
deserve and what they pay to see -- a good game of baseball.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Lions Player, Colo. AD Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT COLLINS, Colo. (AP) -- Thurman ''Fum'' McGraw, the former
Detroit Lions lineman and Colorado State athletic director, died
Wednesday of complications from a stroke. He was 73.
</P>
<P>
   McGraw played defensive tackle for Detroit from 1950-54, helping
the Lions to three NFL championships. He was an assistant coach
with Pittsburgh from 1958-62.
</P>
<P>
   McGraw played football at Colorado State, and also wrestled and
competed in track and field. His No. 48 is one of only two football
numbers retired by the school.
</P>
<P>
   Rams football coach Sonny Lubick called McGraw ''the heart and
soul'' of Colorado State football. The team will honor McGraw with
helmet decals, beginning with Saturday night's game at Arizona
State.
</P>
<P>
   University president Albert Yates called McGraw ''a legend and a
hero to many of us, a man of courage and character who dedicated
his life to helping young people through education and athletics.''
</P>
<P>
   When a knee injury ended his NFL career, McGraw returned to his
alma mater as wrestling coach in 1955 and assisted with the
football and track teams.
</P>
<P>
   After returning to the NFL as an assistant coach with
Pittsburgh, he became a campus administrator at Colorado State in
1962 and was promoted to assistant athletic director three years
later. He led drives to build the school's football stadium and
basketball arena.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, McGraw became an NFL scout, but returned to Colorado
State six years later as athletic director, a post he held until
retiring in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   He was a fixture at the Colorado Rockies' spring training camp
and at Coors Field, and a close friend of Rockies owner Jerry
McMorris.
</P>
<P>
   McGraw was inducted into the Colorado Sports Hall of Fame, the
National Football Foundation and Hall of Fame and the National
Association of College Directors of Athletics Hall of Fame.

FAA, Boeing Agree on Rudder Repair
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Under an agreement with the Federal Aviation
Administration, Boeing is to redesign the rudders of all its 737s, the most
widely used jetliner in the world. The rudders have been suspect following a
pair of fatal accidents in Colorado and Pennsylvania. Three changes have
previously been mandated in 737 rudder controls and officials said they have had
no reports of rudder problems since. Because the redesign could take years, the
FAA will announce new training procedures for pilots on the more than 3,000
twin-engine jets now in service.

   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton repeatedly attacked Republican

national security threat. U.S. District Judge James Parker said he was bound by
the plea agreement to sentence the fired Los Alamos scientist to 278 days, one

Lee read a statement in which he admitted using an unsecure computer to download

officials said today. The change reflects Army leaders' search for ways to make
better use of the National Guard at a time when the active-duty force is
stretched thin by a variety of peacetime missions across the globe. Gen. Eric
Shinseki, the Army chief of staff, is to announce the plan tomorrow at a

<HEADLINE> Albright Lobbies UN on Sudan Seat  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is
lobbying U.N. members to deny Sudan a seat on the U.N. Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
   The African country is an ''unsuitable candidate,'' State
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher cited U.N. reports that Sudan had bombed areas in the
country where U.N. relief operations were based.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the U.N. Charter specifically calls for ''due
regard'' for the maintenance of international peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 2 million people have been killed by fighting,
starvation and disease as the mostly white and Arab government of
Khartoum pursues a 17-year-old war against mostly Christian and
animist black southerners.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department, in a report last week surveying religious
freedom around the world, ranked Sudan, along with Burma, China,
Iran and Iraq, as among the ''countries of particular concern'' --
the most unfavorable category.
</P>
<P>
   Albright talked this week to foreign ministers from several
African countries and elsewhere in her effort to bar Sudan, Boucher
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization of African Unity normally would pick the
African country to take a rotating seat next year on the Security
Council. The General Assembly customarily approves the choice of
such regional groups.
</P>
<P>
   But American officials said there was disagreement over whether
Sudan had the support of a majority of African countries or was in
competition with Mauritius, a democracy preferred by the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt, which is among the countries Albright has approached, was
said to favor Sudan for a seat. Albright also has raised Sudan's
suitability with Britain, France, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, said a
senior U.S. official.
</P>
<P>
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, did not say
what positions those countries took or whether Albright expected to
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan is regarded by State Department officials as having one of
Africa's worst human rights records. As a result, it is not under
consideration for trade benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, U.S. cruise missiles destroyed a pharmaceutical
plant believed to be linked to terrorist operations. Sudan has
denied the claim.
</P>
<P>
   Albright has made a point of urging support for human rights in
speeches and talks with foreign ministers here for General Assembly
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the United States and seven other countries decided
to form a human rights bloc to rally support for resolutions that
promote democracy and to lobby against violations.
</P>
<P>
   As such, they will try to rally opposition to a Security Council
seat for Sudan, said a senior official Wednesday in describing the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The group, which calls itself ''the democracy caucus,'' includes
Chile, the Czech Republic, India, South Korea, Mali, Poland and
Portugal, along with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The United States cannot veto Sudan from the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates for rotating seats on the council are selected by
regional groups, and the 189-member General Assembly then votes for
new council members. The council has five permanent members with
veto powers -- the United States, Britain, France, Russia and China
-- and 10 nonpermanent members who serve two-year terms. Five
nonpermanent members are chosen every year.
</P>
<P>
   French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine told a press breakfast
Wednesday that Egypt and Ethiopia had jointly requested that the
United Nations lift sanctions against Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan's allies on the Security Council introduced a draft
resolution on June 13 that would end limited sanctions imposed to
force Khartoum to hand over suspects in the 1995 assassination
attempt against Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
   The United States twice delayed discussion of the resolution.
Facing a likely U.S. veto if the resolution were put to a vote,
Sudan and the United States reached an agreement to put off the
Security Council discussion on the resolution until mid-November.

<HEADLINE> Islanders Sign Gary Galley  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) -- Garry Galley, the free-agent defenseman
who spent the last two seasons with Los Angeles, signed with the
New York Islanders on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the contract were not disclosed, but newspaper reports
put the deal at $850,000 for one year, with an option year for $1.1
million.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders approached the 37-year-old defenseman when they
were unable to reach an agreement with restricted free-agent
defenseman Zdeno Chara. When Chara signed, Islanders owner Charles
Wang kept the offer to Galley on the table.
</P>
<P>
   ''Galley brings experience and versatility. He can play on
penalty killing, power play and provides depth against injuries,''
Islanders general manager Mike Milbury said.
</P>
<P>
   Galley had nine goals and 21 assists in 70 games last season.

<HEADLINE> Reds 13, Cubs 3  </HEADLINE>
By TERRY KINNEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Benito Santiago had four hits and Rob Bell
made a strong case for returning to the starting rotation as the
Cincinnati Reds beat the Chicago Cubs 13-3 on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago drove in four runs, including a two-run homer, and Alex
Ochoa also had four hits for the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Bell (7-7), demoted after failing to complete the second inning
last Wednesday, started in place of Scott Williamson, who has two
broken toes in his right foot.
</P>
<P>
   Bell allowed six hits, walked three and struck out six in his
first career complete game.
</P>
<P>
   In his last outing, against the New York Mets, Bell walked four
and gave up five runs in 1 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Stynes had a two-run homer and Sean Casey drove in two
with a single and a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds batted around in the third, scoring four runs, to chase
Jamie Arnold (0-3), who allowed five runs on seven hits and a walk
in 2 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago took a 1-0 lead in the first when Eric Young walked,
stole second, advanced to third on Ricky Gutierrez' sacrifice bunt
and scored on Sammy Sosa's double to left field.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Andrews led off the second with his 11th homer, his first
since May 11 after being on the disabled list more than three
months with a herniated disk that required surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago doubled in a run in the second to make it 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati scored four in the third on single by Casey, double
by Dmitri Young, a single by Ochoa and Stynes' sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Reese scored on Casey's sacrifice fly in the fourth, and the
Reds added three in the fifth on a single by Santiago, Juan
Castro's ground out and a single by Michael Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   Ochoa got his fourth single in the sixth and Stynes homered, his
eighth, off Steve Rain.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Eric Young stole his 52nd stolen base of the season and
26th in a row since he was last thrown out. That left him one shy
of his career high with Colorado in 1996. ... Sosa was 2-for-3,
including an infield hit, but hasn't homered since Monday. He has a
major-league high 49 homers and needs just one to join only Babe
Ruth and Mark McGwire as the only players with more than two
50-homer seasons. ... Cincinnati runners stole four bases for the
third time this season. ... The Reds' team physician will watch
Williamson throw on the side Friday to see if he can return to the
rotation next week. Williamson banged into a door in his home
Monday night and broke two toes in his right foot.

<HEADLINE> Saint Ballado Colt Tops Keeneland  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- A chestnut colt by Saint Ballado was
purchased for $850,000 on Wednesday, the top price during the third
session of the Keeneland September Yearling Sale.
</P>
<P>
   Keeneland sold 273 yearlings Wednesday for a total of
$31,700,500. The average price was $116,119 and the median price
was $85,000. A year ago in the third session, Keeneland sold 284
head for $27,996,500 with an average price of $98,579 and a median
of $67,500.
</P>
<P>
   Keeneland has sold 716 yearlings for $193,842,500 so far during
the 13-day auction. The average price is $270,730 and the median
price is $140,000. Last year, after the first three sessions,
Keeneland had sold 755 yearlings for $148,885,500 with an average
price of $197,199 and a median of $110,000.
</P>
<P>
   John C. Oxley won the bidding war for the Saint Ballado colt out
of Sunyata.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought he was very good looking and had all the right
parts,'' said Oxley, who owns champion Beautiful Pleasure. ''He has
a very strong pedigree both on top and bottom and had the looks to
go along with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's sale was modest compared to the first two days of
the auction, when several long-standing auction records were set.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The U.S. men's soccer team won't march
in the opening ceremony at the Summer Games. Instead, it will
settle for taking a small step forward in its Olympics debut --
which is more than the hosts can say.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans battled to a 2-2 tie Wednesday with the Czech
Republic in a game where they nearly managed to pull out a victory.
The U.S. team held a 2-1 lead and missed several scoring
opportunities as the games kicked off 48 hours before Friday's
official start.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no good news for the 93,000 Olympic early birds
packed into the Melbourne Cricket Ground. The home Australians lost
1-0 to Italy despite a rabid home crowd.
</P>
<P>
   That defeat followed a similar fate for the Australian women's
team, which went down 3-0 to Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The soccer games came two days before the Olympics' opening
ceremony, but the competition was already fierce. Chris Albright
and Josh Wolff scored for the United States in a physical contest
with the Czechs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We showed we're a solid team and created a lot of
opportunities for ourselves,'' said Wolff. ''I think we matched
them from the get-go and got in as hard on them as they did on us.
We could have won, so we're a little disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans will stay in Canberra until Saturday's game with
Cameroon, forcing the team to miss Friday's opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen soccer games kicked off the Summer Games, with both
men and woman taking the field for the first glimpse of the
competition.
</P>
<P>
   In other men's action, defending gold medalist Nigeria managed a
3-3 tie against Honduras, while Cameroon defeated Kuwait 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   -- FLAGBEARER: The honor of carrying the flag for the U.S.
athletes at Friday's opening ceremony went to an obscure kayaker
with an incredible story.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Meidl, who survived a 30,000-volt electrical shock in a
1986 construction accident, was selected as flagbearer Thursday
(Wednesday night EDT) by his teammates. Other candidates included
Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong and soccer player Brandi
Chastain.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an incredible honor,'' the 34-year-old Meidl said. ''I
am so proud and honored to be able to represent the USA and to lead
the entire delegation into the stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Meidl, of Redondo Beach, Calif., was working a jackhammer when
he cut through three unmarked high-voltage cables. The charge -- 15
times that of an electric chair -- blew him out of the hole, took
off some of his toes, and cracked open his skull.
</P>
<P>
   After 15 operations, Meidl took up kayaking to help his
rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   -- WOMEN'S SOCCER: Earlier, with the Melbourne Cricket Ground
nearly empty, the games began with the Brazilian women's soccer
team defeating Sweden 2-0. The Australian women, the first of the
home athletes in action at the Summer Games, lost 3-0 to Germany
before a sellout crowd of 23,000 at Canberra's Bruce Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the fans saw the game's start, though, as heavy
security caused long delays getting inside.
</P>
<P>
   -- DRUG TESTING: Three athletes -- a Taiwanese weightlifter, a
Bulgarian triple and long jumper, and a swimmer from Kazakstan --
were kicked out of the games after positive drug tests.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwanese weightlifter Chen Po-pu tested positive for
''prohibited drugs'' on Tuesday, Taiwan's Central News Agency
reported. Officials immediately seized his athlete identification
papers and arranged for his flight back to Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   Bulgarian triple and long jumper Iva Prandzheva, the triple jump
silver medalist at the 1995 world championships, was barred because
of a positive test for nandrolone. Considered a medal contender in
Sydney, Prandzheva already had been banned for two years after the
1996 Games following a positive doping test.
</P>
<P>
   Swimmer Yevgeniya Yermakova of Kazakstan was dumped from the
Olympics after testing positive for a drug masking agent. Yermakova
tested positive for Furosemide, a diuretic, at a meet in Monte
Carlo in May.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the head of the White House drug policy office
praised China for dropping more than 20 athletes from its Olympic
team over failed drug tests.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a tremendous demonstration of their seriousness of
purpose of acting against doping in their own teams,'' Barry
McCaffrey told The Associated Press shortly after arriving in
Sydney. ''It's a terrific signal that they are committed.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey, part of the 10-member official U.S. delegation,
delivered the same message in a letter to China's sports minister.
The delegation also included first daughter Chelsea Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   -- GYMNASTICS: U.S. gymnast Stephen McCain might not take a gold
medal, but his coach has already given the Olympian his ''badge of
courage'' award.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who severely sprained his right ankle in training camp
10 days ago, returned to practice Wednesday and was expected to
compete this weekend. The same was true of teammate John
Roethlisberger, who has battled a strained left calf suffered at
the Olympic trials last month.

   Transportation woes at the Sydney Games mushroomed when dozens
of drivers simply quit the Olympic bus service, citing lousy
schedules and a lack of meal breaks.
</P>
<P>
   A driver speaking on condition of anonymity told the Australian
Associated Press that about 50 drivers stayed home from work
Wednesday morning (Tuesday night EDT) rather than spend another
stressful day behind the wheel.

<HEADLINE> Suns' Longley's Olympic Strategy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Luc Longley has been working outside
for the Australian Olympic team, trying to lure shot-blockers from
away from the basket, and then heading inside.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was uncomfortable in the beginning,'' the Phoenix Suns'
center said. ''They were using me as an offensive initiator with my
dashing speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Longley said centers have been approached with this idea before
and recalled a Russian pivot from the mid-1980s who had his own
solution.
</P>
<P>
   ''He would set up in the paint and then fold his arms until the
three-second violation was called,'' Longley said Thursday. ''Then
he would walk slowly to the other end. He wanted the ball where he
wanted the ball. If I have to resort to that, I will.''
</P>
<P>
   Longley missed the 1996 Atlanta Olympics because of a leg
injury. ''I'm excited to be here,'' he said. ''Having to sit out in
Atlanta was one of the hardest things I had to do.''
</P>
<P>
   He said America's ''Dream Team'' of NBA players, including Suns
teammate Jason Kidd, has a huge edge. ''Their athleticism and skill
level and size and experience put them in a league of their own,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to believe they're beatable. In order to carry that
through the games, the right set of circumstances would involve
creeping up on them.
</P>
<P>
   ''From a competitive point of view, you're out of your mind to
play for second best. You shoot for the stars and hit the moon.''

<HEADLINE> Tourism Authority OKs Pro Bowl Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU (AP) -- The Hawaii Tourism Authority approved a contract
to keep the Pro Bowl in Hawaii for another four years.
</P>
<P>
   The contract approved Wednesday by a voice vote calls for the
state to pay the NFL nearly $19.75 million for games from 2002-05.
</P>
<P>
   The current contract ends with the 2001 game.
</P>
<P>
   The new contract pledges ''best efforts'' by the state to
provide a natural playing surface at Aloha Stadium by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   It also creates a partnership between the state and the NFL that
would pave the way for cooperation on Pro Bowl travel packages, a
Pro Bowl museum, and other sources of revenue, according to former
tourism authority member Mark Rolfing, who negotiated the contract.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL has approved the contract terms, Rolfing said.

<HEADLINE> Mexico To Question Argentine Man  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A man accused of torture during Argentina's
military dictatorship will be questioned in Mexico about the deaths
of 15 French people, including two nuns, the French Embassy said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Miguel Cavallo was arrested last month in Mexico after
five former political prisoners identified him as their alleged
torturer. He is being held in a Mexico City prison while Spanish
officials proceed with an extradition request.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon, who is investigating human rights
abuses under the former military dictatorships of Chile and
Argentina, has accused Cavallo of torture, terrorism, car theft and
forgery.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, investigators in France had asked Mexican officials
to investigate whether Cavallo had anything to do with the death of
15 French citizens in Argentina between 1976 and 1983.
</P>
<P>
   French Embassy spokesman Vicent Petit said Wednesday that
Cavallo will be interrogated in Mexico about the deaths. However,
he declined to release any additional information, including when
the interrogation would take place.
</P>
<P>
   Cavallo has admitted serving in Argentina's military, but denied
the charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   He was serving as director of Mexico's private National Registry
of Motor Vehicles, but the company announced his replacement after
his detention. The registry has been criticized by many in Mexico
for charging too much to register cars.
</P>
<P>
   Garzon is the same judge who issued the warrant that kept former
Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet under house arrest in London for
16 months. He has brought charges against officials for the deaths
of Spaniards in both Argentina and Chile.
</P>
<P>
   At least 9,000 Argentines vanished during the country's
seven-year military dictatorship, which ended in 1983. Human rights
groups put the figure closer to 30,000.

<HEADLINE> Nuke Scientist Wen Ho Lee Is Free  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD BENKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Nine months after he was branded a
threat to national security and put in solitary confinement, Wen Ho
Lee was set free Wednesday with an apology from a judge who said
the government's actions ''embarrassed our entire nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters cheered as a smiling Lee left the courthouse
alongside his family and attorneys. He thanked his supporters and
said, ''I'm very happy to go home with my wife and children
today.''
</P>
<P>
   With a chuckle, he added: ''The next few days, I'm going
fishing.''
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, the diminutive, graying scientist was swamped
by a crowd of about 150 supporters in the back yard of his
neighbors, who waved flags and signs and sang ''For He's a Jolly
Good Fellow.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The last nine months were pretty tough for me,'' he said,
''but I survived.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 60, pleaded guilty to a single count of mishandling nuclear
secrets as the government all but abandoned its crumbling case
against the former Los Alamos scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the plea bargain, he was sentenced to 278
days -- essentially the time served since his arrest last December.
</P>
<P>
   Lee had been charged with 59 counts of breaching national
security and faced life in prison if convicted. Fifty-eight of
those counts were dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ''I sincerely apologize to you, Dr. Lee, for the unfair manner
in which you were held in custody by the executive branch,'' U.S.
District Judge James Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   Parker said the Departments of Justice and Energy ''have
embarrassed our entire nation and each of us who is a citizen of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, a Taiwanese-born naturalized U.S. citizen, read a statement
in court in which he admitted using an unsecure computer to
download a national-defense document onto a tape. He said he knew
his possession of the tape outside of the top-secret area where he
worked was unauthorized.
</P>
<P>
   Lee agreed to cooperate with the government and tell them
everything he knows about seven missing tapes.
</P>
<P>
   The government said that the fate of the tapes was paramount and
that Lee's willingness to explain what happened to them was the
turning point in 2-month-old plea discussions. Lee has said the
tapes were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutor George Stamboulidis said Lee did not deserve
a government apology. He called the downloaded information ''a
personal library'' of nuclear defense secrets.
</P>
<P>
   ''Which Americans among us would want us to turn our backs on
that?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said he was only sorry the plea agreement prevented
disclosure of information that would have shed light on the reasons
for Lee's detention. Lee's supporters have said he was unfairly
singled out as a Chinese-American.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, who was appointed by President Reagan, said he did
not blame the prosecutors: ''It is only the top decision-makers in
the executive branch of the government, in particular the
Department of Justice and the Department of Energy.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House declined to comment on the judge's criticism.
''It is time to close this chapter, find out what happened to the
missing tapes and move on,'' spokesman Jake Siewert said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin said in Washington:
''We respectfully disagree with the judge. We have an obligation to
the American public to protect the national security. Before we had
the assurance from Dr. Lee that he would tell us what he knows, we
could not afford to do anything but detain him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department issued a one-paragraph statement: ''Dr.
Lee pleaded guilty to a felony admitting that he mishandled
sensitive classified information. That speaks for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also said that there are powerful incentives for Lee
to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   ''If at any time we believe he is not being truthful, we can
seek to void the agreement and prosecute the case to the full
extent of the law,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Mark Holscher said he was confident Lee's
cooperation would satisfy the government and lay those issues to
rest.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation began as an offshoot of a Chinese espionage
case, with government attorneys making dire accusations that Lee
had stolen the ''crown jewels'' of U.S. nuclear weaponry science
with the intent of handing them over to a foreign power. At the
time, the government claimed the information could alter the global
balance of power.
</P>
<P>
   The case began disintegrating last month at a renewed bail
hearing, with one embarrassing turn after another for the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Defense experts disputed the claim that the data contained vital
defense secrets. The government was forced to acknowledge that the
material was classified ''restricted'' rather than secret. And a
defense expert testified that ''99 percent'' of the material was
already available to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Also, an FBI agent whose word was key in denying Lee bail
acknowledged giving incorrect testimony that made the scientist
appear deceptive.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides worked out a plea bargain last week, but Lee's
release was delayed twice while attorneys wrangled over details.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement does not affect a civil lawsuit filed by Lee and
his wife, Sylvia, alleging his privacy was violated by the
government, attorney Brian Sun said. The suit is on hold in
Washington, D.C., federal court, awaiting a decision by the Lees
whether to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Lee beamed as he entered the courtroom and gave
his son, Chung, the OK sign. Lee's wife also smiled as she arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Cecelia Chang, an organizer of the Wen Ho Lee Defense Fund,
sobbed with joy as she left the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ''just basically told us that the executive branch is
to blame. He had the courage to say that and to apologize to Dr.
Lee. That is the apology we have waited for from the government,''
Chang said. ''I would love to see the country follow his example.''
</P>
<P>
   A group of Lee's Los Alamos neighbors came to court in ''Free
Wen Ho Lee Now'' T-shirts. The backs of the shirts read: ''Los
Alamos Scientist -- Is He Guilty Before Proven Innocent?''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are elated that Dr. Lee is having his name cleared of the
false allegations that he ever intended to injure the country for
which he spent 20 years designing codes to protect,'' Holscher
said. ''We fully intend to cooperate completely with the government
and provide them whatever information they need.''
</P>
<P>
   Stamboulidis, the prosecutor, said that if Lee had been tried on
the one count to which he pleaded, he could have spent eight years
in prison without disclosing the handling of the tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Some law professors have called for an investigation of the
government's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said he will resume a Senate
subcommittee investigation that he began and then suspended.
</P>
<P>
   ''All I can say is I've thought from the beginning that that was
a botched investigation,'' said Republican Sen. Richard Shelby of
Alabama, chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.

<HEADLINE> Malaria Outbreak Hits Quebec  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- The province of Quebec has been hit with several
cases of malaria, catching public health officials by surprise and
prompting calls for wider screening of immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's remarkable that someone hasn't died,'' said Dr. Ron St.
John, director of emergency response at Health Canada's Center for
Emergency Response.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve cases of malaria have been confirmed in the past month,
all involving refugees from central Africa who arrived last month.
They were on a humanitarian flight to Montreal, which transported
about 240 people from a refugee camp in Burundi, St. John said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that they came from an area with a high incidence of
malaria but weren't screened for the disease when they entered
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities are studying the outbreak and could produce
new screening recommendations, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Current policy calls for routine screening of immigrants for
tuberculosis and syphilis.
</P>
<P>
   Malaria can be transmitted through blood transfusion and
mosquito bites.

<HEADLINE> 'Big Brother' Walkout Flops  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The ''Big Brother'' rebellion went nowhere -- and
neither did the house guests.
</P>
<P>
   Sticking to the CBS reality series' going-nowhere style,
Wednesday's live installment saw a routine banishment of another
resident -- this time, Cassandra -- and little else.
</P>
<P>
   It could have been different.
</P>
<P>
   A dramatic turn of events seemed a possibility last weekend as
insurrection simmered. George, the usually jovial roofer, began
fanning the discontent within the house, where since early July the
sequestered residents have submitted to constant video
surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   Captured on the round-the-clock ''Big Brother'' Web site, the
six house guests could be seen endlessly debating whether to march
out of the house in mutiny during Wednesday's live telecast. That
would have emptied the house more than two weeks before the ''Big
Brother'' finale, when one surviving house guest is scheduled to
collect the grand prize of $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what the protest was meant to accomplish was never
clear, although it would have thrown a kink into CBS's ability to
continue the six-times-a-week series.
</P>
<P>
   CBS promoted Wednesday's show, and the showdown, to pump up
interest in the poorly received series.
</P>
<P>
   ''The big news of the week is the 'Big Brother' rebellion,''
said host Julie Chen at the top of the hour.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a tale full of sound and fury signifying nothing, as
viewers learned when Chen cut to George inside the house. She asked
if he planned to go ahead with his walkout.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Chicken Man's staying,'' said George, referring to himself
by his nickname. The other five house guests also clearly meant to
stay put.
</P>
<P>
   During an in-studio segment with ''health and relationship
specialist'' Dr. Drew Pinsky, Chen asked why the house guests had
considered mass revolt.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems strange to those of us who don't have the perspective
of confinement,'' Pinsky replied. ''Doesn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Then Chen announced the results of the phone poll choosing which
of three house guests ''marked for banishment'' -- Eddie, Curtis or
Cassandra -- would be tossed out.
</P>
<P>
   Cassandra, a dignified New Yorker who works as a United Nations
communications specialist, was nailed with 46 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   With her gone, Josh and Jamie remained, along with Eddie, Curtis
and George, as contenders from the original 10 house guests.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Cuban Kayaker Loses US Appeal  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Kayaker Angel Perez, who competed for
Cuba in the 1992 Olympics, has lost another appeal in his bid to
represent the United States in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Arbitration for Sport on Wednesday became the
latest panel to reject Perez's eligibility because he's been a U.S.
citizen less than a year, far short of the three years mandated by
the International Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Olympic Committee counters that Perez has been a U.S.
national since defecting in 1993. Officials note that Perez, who
lives in Miami, sat out three years before beginning to compete as
an American in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ''In their own bylaws, the IOC makes a distinction between a
national and a citizen,'' said Norm Blake, chief executive of the
USOC. ''If we can demonstrate as a matter of fact that he was a
U.S. national, then he's an eligible athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   But the CAS was as strong in rejecting the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ''The existing rule is clear,'' the decision said.
</P>
<P>
   CAS said there was ''no rule of 'fairness''' in the determining
who can compete and that a ''straightforward reading'' of Olympic
bylaws showed that allowing Perez in would violate the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Blake said another attack was being prepared for the IOC and-or
the CAS.
</P>
<P>
   ''Realistically, we have about a 24-hour window here,'' Blake
said. ''We've got bullets left and I'm going to exhaust the chamber
and go down fighting. We're cautiously optimistic that we'll
prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake said Perez was in tears when they discussed the latest
setback.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's proud of being an American,'' Blake said. ''His wife is
an American, his son was born here, he's competed for the country
internationally with U.S. travel documents. He's done everything
you would ask of a proud American, yet he's being denied an
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   If Perez loses, the other three members of his four-man kayak
entry could be out of luck, too. Rules call for the entire entry to
be booted, although the U.S. could seek permission to replace only
Perez.
</P>
<P>
   Perez has been ranked among the top two in the United States
since resuming competition in 1997. He made the Olympic team in the
trials in June, then the problems began.
</P>
<P>
   The International Canoe Federation says athletes can change
countries as long as they have had citizenship for three years or
have the approval of their former country.
</P>
<P>
   USOC officials visited Cuba in July to seek their permission to
allow Perez to compete. They gave a resounding no. Coming on the
heels of the Elian Gonzalez saga, Perez's timing couldn't have been
worse.

<HEADLINE> Okla. Stoops' Gets Contract Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORMAN, Okla. (AP) -- Oklahoma football coach Bob Stoops received
a contract extension through the 2005 season Wednesday that could
raise his annual pay to between $900,000 and $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted to demonstrate the tremendous confidence we have in
Bob Stoops,'' athletic director Joe Castiglione said after the
Board of Regents approved the contract.
</P>
<P>
   The compensation package includes deferred benefits of $150,000
contingent upon Stoops remaining head coach through 2004. It also
includes outside compensation from non-state appropriated funds of
about $80,000 to an estimated $530,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Performance incentives, including a national title bonus, were
increased by about $70,000 to a maximum $200,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Stoops joined the Sooners in December 1998 after serving as
Florida's defensive coordinator. He inherited a program that had
not had a winning season since 1993 and was 12-22 in the previous
three seasons. Oklahoma is 2-0 and ranked No. 18 after a 7-5 season
in 1999 that saw the Sooners go to the Independence Bowl.

<HEADLINE> Phillies 15, Expos 5  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Scott Rolen hit two triples and a double,
driving in three runs as the Philadelphia Phillies beat the
Montreal Expos 15-5 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Burrell homered and also drove in three runs for the
Phillies, who finished with 19 hits in their highest-scoring game
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Guerrero hit his 37th home run for Montreal and pitcher
Felipe Lira also connected.
</P>
<P>
   Rolen, who began the game with only three triples this season,
tripled to spark a five-run fifth inning. The Phillies added four
more runs in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Chen (7-2) got the win despite pitching just five innings
and allowing the Expos to take a 5-2 lead. Guerrero's two-run homer
in the first ended Chen's streak of 20 2-3 scoreless innings.
</P>
<P>
   Chen gave up seven hits and walked two. He ended his of four
no-decisions and gave him his first victory since Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Lira (4-6) made an emergency start after Trey Moore felt
stiffness in his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Lira, who had pitched an inning out of the bullpen during
Monday's doubleheader, worked four-plus innings. He gave up six
runs and 10 hits.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, Lira hit his second homer of the season to give
the Expos a 5-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Lira left in the fifth after the first four hitters reached
base, capped by Rolen's triple and an RBI single by Burrell that
tied it at 5.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Forster came on in relief but did not record an out,
walking the first two batters and surrendering an RBI single to
Tomas Perez. Julio Santana relieved and allowed one run to score on
an infield grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Rolen hit another RBI triple in the sixth and scored on an error
by third baseman Mike Mordecai. Tom Prince added an RBI double and
pinch-hitter Kevin Jordan had an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, Burrell hit a two-run homer to the upper deck in
left field, the second time he has done it this season.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero hit a two-run homer to left-center field in the first
inning on a half-swing. He appeared to be fooled on the pitch, but
still managed to muscle it into the seats.
Notes: The last Phillies player to hit two triples in a game was
Midre Cummings on Sept. 19, 1997, against the Cubs. ... Chen's
scoreless streak was the third-longest streak in the NL this
season. ... The Expos completed their longest road trip of the
season at 6-8. ... Guerrero was intentionally walked for the 22nd
time, most for the Expos since Tim Raines had 26 in 1987.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Tom McMahon, Colorado's co-defensive coordinator.
had surgery Wednesday to remove cancerous growths and his right
lung.
</P>
<P>
   McMahon's wife, Marilyn, told school officials that doctors
believed they removed all the cancer and that his prognosis was
excellent.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we received the good news, it was like a big, dark cloud
was lifted off us today,'' Colorado coach Gary Barnett said.
</P>
<P>
   McMahon, 51, was diagnosed with cancer less than three months
ago. Doctors first said the cancer was inoperable, but radiation
and chemotherapy reduced the growths enough to allow surgery.

<HEADLINE> Expelled Teens Charged With Robbery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DECATUR, Ill. (AP) -- Three of the teens whose expulsions from
school for a football game brawl set off protests -- and a campaign
by the Rev. Jesse Jackson -- have been charged with robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt Fuller, 19; Errol Bond, 17; and Bruce Manns, 17, were
arrested after another teen-ager, an acquaintance, told police they
and a fourth teen beat him Tuesday and stole $120. Also arrested
Tuesday was 17-year-old Darrien Spates.
</P>
<P>
   The four were jailed on preliminary charges of robbery and
felony mob action, said police Lt. James Chervinko. At a hearing
Wednesday, bond was set at $50,000 for Fuller, $15,000 for Spates
and $12,000 apiece for Manns and Bond, who was later released after
paying the total.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-year-old who filed the complaint had minor injuries but
did not go to a hospital, Chervinko said.
</P>
<P>
   Fuller, Bond, Manns and three other students were expelled for
two years after the stands-clearing brawl at a high school football
game one year ago. Another student withdrew from school.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson used the boys' case as a platform for a national crusade
against ''zero tolerance'' school policies that require expulsion
for any form of violence.
</P>
<P>
   A judge permanently banned the protesters from campus in March,
agreeing with administrators that demonstrations had disrupted
classes.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Myers Jr., an attorney for Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH
Coalition, said in a statement Wednesday he was ''deeply
concerned'' about the teens' arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ''As these young men continue to struggle with the daily
notoriety of the 'Decatur Expulsion Case,' they also face pressures
of growing up poor, black and with fewer life options,'' Myers
said.
</P>
<P>
   The school board eventually reduced the expulsions to one year
and allowed the boys to attend alternative school.
</P>
<P>
   Fuller, who was charged with felony mob action after the
football game brawl, already had been arrested twice since then.
Earlier this year, he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor battery and
domestic battery in a plea agreement that consolidated the three
cases.
</P>
<P>
   Manns and Bond were both 16 at the time of the fight and were
not charged as adults.

<HEADLINE> Canseco Thriving During Yanks' Run  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- In a corner of the New York Yankees' clubhouse,
Jose Canseco got up from his chair, and made a proclamation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going for the record,'' he said. ''Most DL trips with 500
home runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Canseco, who has 446 homers and 11 stints on the disabled list,
is hitting .278 with six homers and 18 RBIs in 79 at-bats since
Aug. 7, when the Yankees claimed him on waivers from Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   He was 3-for-3 with three RBIs and three runs scored in Tuesday
night's 10-2 win over Toronto, and was back in the lineup at
designated hitter Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't expect to play today. I don't take it for granted,''
Canseco said before Wednesday's 3-2 Yankee's win. ''You have
players here who are everyday players and do a great job at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Humble one moment, he can be among baseball's most boastful the
next.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been from the best player in the world to a bum, washed
up,'' he said. ''I've been through so much in the game, more
probably than anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankees manager Joe Torre was surprised when his general
manager, Brian Cashman, claimed Canseco, a move made to prevent him
going to a team the Yankees could later battle for the AL pennant.
</P>
<P>
   It's turned into a pleasant surprise, adding pop to an offense
that's slumped in several stretches. Canseco says he doesn't know
if he'll be picked for the 25-man postseason roster, but Torre made
it sound as if the 36-year-old player is a shoo-in -- because he's a
power threat.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even when he doesn't swing the bat,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   As a DH, Canseco partly fills the void caused by Darryl
Strawberry's season-long suspension. Strawberry hit three homers
against Baltimore in the 1996 playoffs, and two in the postseason
last year, one against Texas, another against Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Torre also remembered how Strawberry pinch hit and walked
against Greg Maddux in the eighth inning of last year's World
Series opener, giving New York two on and no outs as it overcame a
1-0 deficit to beat the Braves 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   ''As opposed to Darryl, where Darryl is definitely one-sided as
to facing right-handers (only), Canseco has played every day,''
Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   That makes it likely both Canseco and Glenallen Hill will be on
the postseason roster, with one DHing and the other pinch hitting.
David Justice will be the third outfielder, joining Bernie Williams
and Paul O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   Canseco hasn't been to the playoffs since 1990, when he helped
Oakland go to the World Series for the third straight year. He was
''shocked'' to find out that the Yankees had claimed him, giving
him another shot at postseason play.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to be in the lineup every day,'' he said. ''I want to
help the team, day in, day out. I'm a proven power hitter. If I'm
not in the game, I don't feel I'm contributing.''
</P>
<P>
   If not for injuries, Canseco, not Ken Griffey Jr. and Mark
McGwire, might be the person aiming for Hank Aaron's career home
run record of 755. His bio is like a trip through a medical
dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   Canseco fractured his left hand in 1989, had a protruding disc
in his back in 1990, a sore shoulder in 1992, a torn right elbow
ligament in 1993, a groin strain and rib injury in 1995, a strained
right hip flexor and a ruptured disc in 1996, back spasms in 1997,
a herniated disc in 1999 and a strained left heel this year.
</P>
<P>
   All the missed time makes his career totals mean that much more
to him.
</P>
<P>
   ''You want to reach the 500-homer plateau and go from there,''
he said. ''I've been through so much, if I quit now, it would be
for nothing. You definitely want to reach that. I've been through
so much in baseball, so many surgeries, so much time off, so many
ups and downs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees hold an option for 2001, and it's unclear what the
future holds for Canseco. He just wants to play.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm 36, but I don't consider myself your average 36-year-old
athlete,'' he said. ''I take care of myself way too much. If
anybody's noticed, the at-bats per home run are better than when I
was younger.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Defends Ties to Weinstein  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore's campaign on Wednesday defended his
fund-raising help from movie mogul Harvey Weinstein who went around
Disney in 1995 to release the controversial NC-17 rated ''Kids.''
It's just the sort of film the Democratic presidential candidate
has been criticizing.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and running mate Joseph Lieberman threatened new federal
legislation or rules against the entertainment industry within six
months if it doesn't stop marketing violent and sexual products to
young people.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Gore is planning to attend a Thursday night
fund-raiser at New York's Radio City Music Hall that Miramax
co-chairman Weinstein helped organized, capping a week of
fund-raising reaching $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not about our supporters, this is not about our
opponents, this is about what's right for America's children,''
Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said in defending the vice president's
association with Weinstein. ''Al Gore has proposed concrete steps
to protect America's kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were quick to criticize.
</P>
<P>
   ''Al Gore with one hand is making promises to voters about how
he's going to clean up Hollywood and with the other hand taking
money from Hollywood,'' said Terry Holt, a spokesman for the
Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   RNC Chairman Jim Nicholson planned a news conference in New York
on Thursday to ''talk about the Hollywood hypocrisy of Al Gore,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein has long been a strong supporter of the Democratic
Party, Gore and President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's appearance at a fund-raiser with Weinstein comes at an
awkward time, however, as he's publicly criticizing media violence.
</P>
<P>
   It also gives the Republicans and George W. Bush's presidential
campaign an opportunity to raise the issue of Gore's credibility,
arguing that he has a habit of saying one thing and doing another.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the Miramax film ''Kids'' was released under an NC-17
rating. Because of parent company Disney's policy not to release
NC-17 films, Miramax set up a separate distribution to release the
movie about adolescents using drugs and engaging in sex.
</P>
<P>
   The NC-17 rating was created in 1990 to separate films with
strong adult content from porno films, which are X-rated.
</P>
<P>
   Miramax also has released the violent movies ''Pulp Fiction''
and ''Reservoir Dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Sen. Lieberman testified at a Senate Commerce
Committee hearing on a Federal Trade Commission report that
asserted the entertainment industry was peddling adult material to
underage audiences.
</P>
<P>
   He decried a ''culture of carnage'' surrounding young people and
told lawmakers the government should stop the marketing of violent
movies, music and video games to children if the industry fails to
police itself.

<HEADLINE> No Party, Protest in Dutch Gay Vote  </HEADLINE>
By ANTHONY DEUTSCH
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- Neither party nor protest was held
Wednesday following the passing of groundbreaking gay rights
legislation, as most in the country seemed to shrug off the equal
rights bill permitting homosexual marriages and adoption as part of
the Dutch view of modern life.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was backed in a 109-33 vote in the 150-seat of the
lower house Tuesday and gay rights activists said it will create
unprecedented equality for gay couples. Staunch resistance came
only from a small minority of religious political parties.
</P>
<P>
   It is set to become law next year, pending a vote in the upper
house of parliament, largely seen as a formality.
</P>
<P>
   Saskia Keuzenkamp, a sociologist with a leading governmental
advisory body, said the overwhelming acceptance of the bill mirrors
a real change in public views on personal sexual preference.
</P>
<P>
   ''In recent years the acceptance of homosexuality here has risen
sharply, especially when compared to other countries,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Under Dutch law, only Dutch citizens or people with resident
permits may marry in the Netherlands, whether they are heterosexual
or gay.
</P>
<P>
   A European-wide survey conducted by the Socio-Cultural Planning
Bureau and presented Wednesday to Prime Minister Wim Kok, found
that 76 percent of the Dutch population considers homosexuality
acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   The gay marriage issue received little media attention and
domestic newspapers brushed the vote aside with brief articles.
</P>
<P>
   The new law won't significantly change the daily lives of most
gays after the Registered Partnership Act was adopted in 1998,
giving gay couples the same pension, inheritance and tax benefits
as heterosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, gay couples will be free to convert that status
of ''registered partnership'' to full-fledged marriages, complete
with wider adoption rights and divorce guidelines. Adopting
children overseas will remain barred to avoid confrontations with
countries that don't allow gays to marry.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch take the lead on other social issues besides gay
rights. Officials tolerate the use of small quantities of so-called
soft-drugs such as marijuana and hashish, allowing cafes to sell
cannabis joints and a cup of coffee. Prostitution is on open
display in well-regulated red-light districts, where scantly clad
women sit like merchandise in shop windows.

<HEADLINE> Notes From Wednesday's Baseball Games  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressAMERICAN LEAGUE:
Orioles-Rangers:
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: The Orioles entered Wednesday night's game with 285
doubles and were on pace to hit 318. The club record is 299 set in
1996 and 1999. ... OF Albert Belle missed his ninth straight game
with inflammation of his right hip and was given permission to
return to Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: C Bill Haselman will keep playing through the weekend
until he undergoes arthroscopic surgery on Monday to repair a
partial tear of his right rotator cuff. Haselman was Texas'
starting catcher Wednesday night against Baltimore. Team doctors
say Haselman can't further injure the shoulder by playing. Haselman
took over as the everyday catcher when Ivan Rodriguez broke his
right thumb and was lost for the season on July 24. ... Randy Knorr
and B.J. Waszgis will share the catching duties for the final two
weeks of the season.
Red Sox-Indians:
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: RHP Rich Garces reported significant improvement in his
strained right groin after throwing on the side Tuesday. Garces,
who left a Sept. 7 appearance against Minnesota, said if the Red
Sox weren't fighting for a playoff spot he would be on the DL. ...
Reliever Rod Beck was on his way to the mound Tuesday night when he
saw Hector Carrasco warming up for the seventh inning. Beck
returned to the bullpen only to have pitching coach Joe Kerrigan
wave him in. ''It's a little embarrassing when you run out there,''
Beck said. ''It makes you look like you don't know what the hell
you're doing. I've seen it happen to other guys but it's the first
time I've done it.'' ... Rico Brogna, acquired in a waiver claim on
Aug. 3 from the Phillies, has hardly played since declining the
team's request to go to the minors on a rehab assignment. Brogna,
in a 2-for-15 slump, is also upset with comments GM Dan Duquette
made in a newspaper story saying Brogna's bat speed is too slow.
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: RHP Charles Nagy will make his first start since May
on Thursday in the series finale against Pedro Martinez and the Red
Sox. Nagy had bone chips in his elbow removed on May 19. ''I'm
nervous, excited, the whole nine yards,'' he said. Nagy had tried
to return for his surgery early, but suffered a setback. ''It was
supposed to be 6-to-8 weeks and it turned into a four-month bear,''
he said. Nagy still has pain in his elbow. ''You know when it rains
and when it's going to be cold.'' ... Indians manager Charlie
Manuel said the odds were 50-50 that left-hander C.C. Sabathia
would start one of the games in Boston next week when Cleveland
plays back-to-back doubleheaders. Sabathia, the Indians' top
pitching prospect, returned from the Sydney Games in Australia
after the U.S. team wanted him to pitch as a reliever. When the
Indians allowed the left-hander to go, it was under the condition
that he'd be in the starting rotation and on a pitch count. ...
When he watches the Boston Red Sox, Indians manager Charlie Manuel
sees a lot of his team. ''They're real scrappy,'' Manuel said.
''We're almost the same kind of team -- except for Pedro.''
Blue Jays-Yankees:
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: Going into Wednesday's game, Toronto's Triple Crown
threat, Carlos Delagdo, was homerless in 13 games. He still had 39
homers, three off Frank Thomas' league-leading total. ... Tony
Batista, in a 9-for-70 slump coming in, singled off Yankees 3B
Scott Brosius' glove in his first at-bat. ... The Blue Jays, tied
with New York for the AL East lead at the All-Star break, have gone
27-28 since in falling to third place, nine games behind the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: David Cone might actually have been helped by his
separated left shoulder, according to manager Joe Torre. ''It will
give him something to concentrate on,'' Torre said. ''Without any
problems, he got buried early.'' Because of the problem with his
non-pitching shoulder, Cone, scheduled to pitch Friday against
Cleveland, has pain if he gets away from his proper mechanics and
lets his hips fly open. ''Nobody will have to say, 'Keep it
closed,''' Torre said. ... CF Bernie Williams, who has missed seven
of eight games after straining his right rib cage, could be back in
the lineup Thursday or Friday. He's bothered now by a slight calf
strain.
Tigers-White Sox:
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: The Tigers will probably miss RHP Pedro Martinez this
weekend when Boston visits. In fact, manager Phil Garner said he
has yet to see Martinez in a game. ''I'd like to see him pitch,''
Garner said. ''I'd like to beat him, too.'' ... Knuckleballers
Steve Sparks and Tim Wakefield will meet Friday. ... The Tigers had
gone four games without a home run, their longest stretch this
season, before hitting two Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: SS Jose Valentin, who has a bruise in his pelvic area,
has opted to not get a cortisone shot despite the pain. He was in
the starting lineup Wednesday. ... DH Harold Baines started for
only the 11th time since being acquired July 31. Baines batted .220
with eight RBIs in August. ''It's been very difficult to get him
at-bats,'' Manuel said. ''It's probably been unfair to him. But you
can't get a guy more professional than Harold Baines.'' ... RHP Jon
Rauch, who split the season between Double-A Birmingham and Class A
Winston-Salem, was named Minor League Player of the Year by
Baseball America. Rauch was a combined 16-4 with a 2.66 ERA and 187
strikeouts and earned a spot on the U.S. Olympic team.
Twins-Athletics:
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: Utilityman Denny Hocking has wrecked the A's this
season. He tied his career high with five hits against them on May
18, then went 3-for-4 against them Tuesday night, driving in all
three runs in a 5-3 Twins loss. Jason Giambi called him ''Babe
Ruth,'' and A's manager Art Howe suggested his team was going to
''Plan Z'' against him. ''At least I got him out once,'' Tuesday
night's pitcher Mark Mulder said. Hocking was in the leadoff spot
on Wednesday and singled to open the game, eventually scoring
Minnesota's first run. ... OF Torii Hunter missed his fourth
straight game because of a groin strain. He's expected back in the
lineup Friday when the Twins return home to face Anaheim. ... LHP
Johan Santana will return to the rotation to start Saturday's game
against the Angels. He made two previous starts, but was sent to
the bullpen. He's 2-2, with a 6.12 ERA this season and will replace
LHP Juan Romero (2-6, 7.36).
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: In case of a division tie between Oakland the Mariners,
the A's would travel to Seattle for a single game on Oct. 2. If the
A's and Angels tie, Anaheim would come to Oakland. If a playoff
game is needed to determine the wild card team, the A's would play
host to Cleveland or Boston, and travel to Toronto, Anaheim or
Seattle. ... 3B Eric Chavez was given the day off to rest a sore
heel and because the Twins started LHP Eric Milton. Chavez is
hitting .196 against left-handers this season, but .268 in his last
45 games. ... OF Matt Stairs was also out of the lineup because of
his .170 average against lefties. Stairs is at .223 overall, but is
hitting .313 in September.
Royals-Mariners:
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: LF Mark Quinn was scratched from the lineup before
Wednesday night's game because he didn't think he was ready to
play. He came out of Sunday's game against Texas in the seventh
because of a cramp in his right hamstring. He was replaced by Dave
McCarty in LF. Quinn is a top candidate for AL Rookie of the Year.
He leads AL rookies in homers (20), RBIs (70) and on-base
percentage (.345). ... Since the All-Star break, Johnny Damon has
as many games with four hits or more as hitless games, eight each.
He's hit safely in 51 of 59 games in the second half of the season.
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: The Mariners, who open a road trip Friday night in
Baltimore, haven't won the opening game of a road trip since June
29, 1999, when they beat Oakland 2-1 -- a span of 15 road trips. ...
The Mariners have used 36 players this season, tied for fewest in
the league with Minnesota. Of the 36 players, 17 did not play for
the Mariners last season. ... Manager Lou Piniella needs two wins
for 1,100 career victories. In Seattle, Piniella has a 619-591
record for a .512 winning percentage.
Devil Rays-Angels:
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: LF Greg Vaughn, whose sore right shoulder has limited
him to DH duty for the final month of the season, was examined by
Angels team physician Dr. Lewis Yocum after Tuesday night's game
and was told he wouldn't need surgery. ''I slept a lot better last
night. It's been about a month, and I wanted to know what was going
on,'' said Vaughn, who will be examined again by Dr. James Andrews
when the team returns to Tampa. ... Bench coach Bill Russell still
has the urge to manage again -- and filling in for Larry Rothschild
during the Devil Rays manager's recent three-game suspension
intensified that feeling. ''I enjoyed it,'' said Russell, who was
fired by the Dodgers 74 games into the 1998 season. ''I'd like to
get back into a managerial slot. I mean, I'm enjoying my stay in
Tampa, but I will test the waters. There will probably be some
openings, so we'll see how it works out.'' ... 1B Fred McGriff
entered Wednesday night's game needing three home runs and three
RBIs to reach his average in both categories during the previous
four years.
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: Even if Darin Erstad doesn't pick up a bat the rest of
the season, the Angels' leadoff hitter has enjoyed the most
consistent offensive campaign in club history with a major
league-leading 214 hits, 68 multi-hit games, 23 home runs, 92 RBIs
and a .354 average. ''You can't ask him to do it again, because
that's an aberration,'' Mo Vaughn said. ''They shouldn't expect him
to have 200 hits by September again next year. This was just one of
those great years where everything fell into place.'' ... Batting
coach Mickey Hatcher, who made his career as a contact hitter,
insisted that the 432 combined strikeouts by Vaughn, Troy Glaus and
Tim Salmon is a worthwhile tradeoff for the trio's total of 108
home runs. ''What's the difference between a guy hitting 100 ground
balls for outs, and striking out 100 times?'' Hatcher said. ''There
are guys who are going to be aggressive with two outs. They're
looking for a mistake, and they should be swinging for the fence.''
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Brewers-Mets:
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: Curtis Leskanic had converted all nine save chances
before blowing Wednesday's opportunity in the ninth. ''I have all
the confidence in the world in Curtis,'' manager Davey Lopes said.
''Sometimes it just doesn't happen.'' ... Jeff D'Amico had a
career-high 10 strikeouts. ''That doesn't matter as long as I get
the guy out,'' he said. ... Marquis Grissom became the 65th player
to reach 400 stolen bases.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Mike Piazza, in a 5-for-34 slide, struck out all four
times he batted for just the second four-strikeout game of his
career. ''I'm very frustrated,'' he said. ''That's just the way it
is. Hopefully I hit rock bottom today and will bounce back.'' ...
The Mets, 33-37 on the road, head out on an 11-game road trip to
Montreal, Atlanta and Philadelphia after a dramatic, extra-inning
win. ''If there was ever a carryover effect, I'd hope this would be
it,'' manager Bobby Valentine said. ... Closer Armando Benitez, out
the past three days with a sore right big toe, pitched the 10th for
the win. ''I felt great,'' he said.
Marlins-Braves:
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: The Marlins, who hold a 6-4 edge over the Braves with
two games left before Wednesday night, are 30-30 against Atlanta
during the last five seasons, best in the NL. Chicago at 23-25 is
next. ... The Marlins are 30-19 in one-run games, second only in
the NL To St. Louis' 24-15 record.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: The Braves had only 11 last at-bat wins entering
Wednesday night's game and since the All-Star break, only two -- on
July 16 and Aug. 11. Last season, the Braves won 31 games in their
last at-bat, including 15 after the break. ... LF B.J. Surhoff
missed his fifth straight game with a pulled right quadriceps and
is not expected back before the weekend at the earliest.
Expos-Phillies:
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: LHP Trey Moore, scratched as Wednesday's starter, will
be examined by Expos team doctor Larry Coughlin on Thursday and
will have an MRI performed on Friday. He experiences stiffness in
his left shoulder while throwing on the side on Tuesday night. ...
Montreal farmhands Brad Wilkerson and Shayne Bennett will
participate in the Olympics, with Wilkerson playing for the United
States and Bennett pitching for host Australia. ... The Expos
return home for a 12-game stretch before finishing the season on
the road. They do not have a scheduled off-day in September.
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: On Thursday, the Phillies will announce an
agreement with the newly formed Lakewood (N.J.) BlueClaws of the
Class A South Atlantic League. Currently, the Phillies have an
agreement with the Piedmont (N.C.) Boll Weevils. ... The Phillies
donated 15,000 tickets to the Junior Baseball Federation (JBF), the
agency that benefits sandlot baseball in the Philadelphia. The
tickets raised $300,000 for JBF. ... Two minor league affiliates,
Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre (International League) and Double-A
Reading (Eastern League), are in their league championships.
Cardinals-Pirates:
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: Another night, another new position for Mark McGwire.
McGwire was officially the Cardinals' starting shortstop for
Wednesday's game against the Pirates. This is manager Tony La
Russa's way of getting one plate appearance for McGwire, who can't
play in the field because of patella tendinitis in the right knee.
McGwire had been listed as the second baseman and left fielder
previously. He leaves after his one at-bat and is replaced by the
real starter. McGwire lined a single to left against Todd Ritchie
and was replaced by pinch-runner Placido Polanco. Since La Russa
started using McGwire in the first inning of road games, McGwire is
2-for-5 with a homer in six plate appearances. ... La Russa wants
the Cardinals front office to put together a highlight tape of some
of C Mike Matheny's throws. ''He should be the Gold Glove award
winner,'' La Russa said. ''I don't know if you can campaign for
that or not.'' In Tuesday's game against Pittsburgh, Matheny picked
Alex Ramirez off second in the second inning and wound up changing
the complexion of a game the Cardinals went on to win 11-1.
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: Mike Benjamin was the Pirates' starting second
baseman Wednesday. He had missed 22 games with a lower back strain.
... Kevin Young worked out at first base on Wednesday and
pronounced himself ready to play after missing 15 games with a
groin strain. ''I want to play tomorrow if they let me,'' he said.
Manager Gene Lamont indicated he won't use Young for the opening
game in Houston but didn't rule out the possibility he might play
during the weekend series against the Astros.
Cubs-Reds:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: Eric Young stole second in the first Wednesday, his
52nd stolen base and the 26th in a row without being thrown out.
... Kerry Wood pitched only the second complete game of his career
in a 2-1 victory Tuesday but has always done well against the Reds.
He is 4-0 in four starts dating to his 1998 Rookie of the Year
season. ... Tuesday's win was the 500th as a manager for Don
Baylor. He got the first 440 with Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: The Reds' team physician will watch Scott Williamson
throw on the side Friday to see if he can return to the rotation
next week. Williamson was scratched from his scheduled start
Wednesday night because he banged into a door in his home Monday
night and broke two toes in his right foot. ... Alex Ochoa is
becoming a fixture in the Reds' lineup, especially since he homered
in three consecutive games for the first time in his career.
Giants-Astros:
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: Former Astros reliever Doug Henry had to find his
way into the visitors' clubhouse this time when the Giants came to
Enron Field. He spent 2&AMP;frac12; years with the Astros before he was dealt
to the Giants this season. ''I managed to find it OK,'' Henry said.
''It feels weird. I have some very good friends (in Houston). It's
nice coming back. I'm happy in San Francisco right now, but I miss
the guys here (Houston).'' ... Russ Ortiz will start against San
Diego on Friday in his first appearance since the Padres snapped
his seven-game winning streak Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: Equaling his club-record 43 home run mark isn't the
number that interests Jeff Bagwell. He'd rather his team be No. 1
in the NL Central. ''That isn't a big deal,'' Bagwell said. ''I hit
43 in 1997 and we won the division. that was fun.''... Moises Alou
entered Wednesday night's game with a .357 average and is
approaching the franchise record of .368 set by Bagwell in his MVP
season of 1994.
Dodgers-Diamondbacks:
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: Eric Karros drove in his 100th run Tuesday night,
marking the fifth time he's reached that mark during his nine-year
career. ... Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said Dave Hansen's
major-league record for pinch-hit homers in a single season is more
remarkable because Hansen doesn't swing for the fences. ''He's not
a home run hitter,'' Johnson said. ''He's a line-drive hitter.''
Hansen hit his seventh pinch-hit homer of the year Tuesday,
breaking the mark set by Brooklyn's Johnny Frederick in 1932. ...
When Jeff Williams relieved Luke Prokopec on Tuesday, it marked the
first time when Australian had replaced another on the mound,
according to the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: Danny Bautista replaced Steve Finley in center field.
Finley was hit on the left hand by Onan Masaoka's pitch in the
eighth inning Tuesday. Preliminary X-rays were negative, but Finley
still had pain in the hand and was scratched from the lineup. He's
listed as day-to-day. ... David Dellucci, whose eighth-inning
infield single drove in the go-ahead run Tuesday, made his second
start of the season in right. ... Arizona is 22-15 against the NL
West, the best such mark in the division. ... Reliever Byung-Hyun
Kim has recorded three of the Diamondbacks' last four victories.
Rockies-Padres:
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: RHP Masato Yoshii will make his next start after fears
he might be lost for the season following his start Tuesday night.
Yoshii left after only five innings with soreness in his right
biceps. Both Yoshii and manager Buddy Bell thought the right-hander
might have to shut it down for the season because of the recurring
injury. But Yoshii's arm felt much better Wednesday and he is
scheduled to start Sunday at Los Angeles. ... Jose Jimenez recorded
his 20th save on Tuesday night, becoming only the fourth Rockies
pitcher to reach that mark. Dave Veres is the single-season leader
with 31. ... The Rockies have won four of six games in San Diego
with one game left. It's the first time the Rockies have won a
season road series against the Padres since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: The chances of signing second-round draft pick Xavier
Nady are ''slim,'' according to GM Kevin Towers. Nady's
''adviser,'' agent Scott Boras said Nady rejected the Padres'
latest offer of a major league contract worth more than $2.5
million over four years. Towers said the contract is the club's
final offer. ''If it doesn't happen,'' Towers said, ''we could look
ourselves in the mirror and feel pretty good about ourselves.''
It's the first time the Padres have offered a major league contract
to a draft pick, Towers said. Nady, a power-hitting 3B from the
University of California, was seeking a contract similar to the one
Detroit gave 3B Eric Munson that paid the former USC star 6.75
million over four years. ... 3B Phil Nevin, out for a week with an
abdominal strain, predicted he'd be back in the lineup tonight.
Trainer Todd Hutcheson said the earliest Nevin will return will be
at least another week.

<HEADLINE> Giants 3, Astros 2  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL A. LUTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Barry Bonds hit his career-high 47th home run,
and Armando Rios hit a solo homer in the ninth inning that lifted
the San Francisco Giants over the Houston Astros 3-2 Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds homered in his third straight game for the NL West
leaders, connecting for a solo shot in the seventh inning off
rookie Wade Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds broke his homer high of 46 set in 1993, his first season
with the Giants. The All-Star outfielder's eighth homer of the
month was the 492nd of his career, one behind Lou Gehrig for 17th
place on the all-time list.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants completed a three-game series and improved to 6-0
overall at Enron Field.
</P>
<P>
   Rios hit his 10th homer with two outs in the ninth off Miller
(5-6).
</P>
<P>
   Livan Hernandez (15-10) pitched eight innings for the victory.
Robb Nen got his 36th save, converting his 23rd straight chance.
</P>
<P>
   Miller took a three-hitter and a 2-0 lead into the seventh.
Bonds led off with a home run, Jeff Kent followed with a double and
J.T. Snow hit a double that tied it.
</P>
<P>
   Rios then singled, but was caught trying to take second. Miller
preserved the tie when Bobby Estalella popped up and Hernandez
struck out.
</P>
<P>
   Miller didn't allow a runner to reach second base until the
Giants rallied in the seventh. He struck out four and walked one as
the Giants snapped his three-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hidalgo's RBI single in the first extended his
career-high hitting streak to 15 games. Mitch Meluskey also had an
RBI single, giving the Astros a 2-0 lead in the opening inning.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez settled down after that and permitted only one more
runner to reach second base. He struck out seven and allowed seven
hits.
Notes: Bonds has passed Stan Musial, Willie Stargell, Dave
Winfield and Carl Yastrzemski on the career homer list this season.
... Jeff Bagwell and Hidalgo are the second Astros duo to hit at
least 30 homers in the same season. Moises Alou (38) and Bagwell
(34) did it in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Indians 10, Red Sox 3  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Bartolo Colon was finally the No. 1 starter
Cleveland needs him to be and Manny Ramirez homered and drove in
four runs Wednesday night, leading the Indians to a 10-3 win over
the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   The victory moved Cleveland 1&AMP;frac12; games ahead of Oakland and three
games up on Boston in the AL wild card race. And the timing
couldn't have been better for the Indians -- Pedro Martinez will
start for the Red Sox on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez is 8-0 in his career against Cleveland and will be
pitching in Jacobs Field for the first time since April 30 when he
hit Roberto Alomar and was suspended for five games.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez hit a three-run double off Tomo Ohka (3-5) in the fourth
and later added his 29th homer. He has eight RBIs in the first two
games of the series and 102 in just 97 games this season.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Branyan and David Segui added two-run homers for the
Indians, who play the Red Sox six more times in the next eight
days.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Varitek homered for Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Colon (13-8) allowed two earned runs and six hits in seven
innings. In his last start, Colon was leading 3-1 and needed one
out to get through the seventh, when he told Indians manager
Charlie Manuel he was tired.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't what Manuel wanted to hear and he sat the
25-year-old down for a talk. Apparently, Colon took it to heart. He
hit 100 mph in striking out Carl Everett in the first, and was
never in real trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Colon didn't have a 1-2-3 inning until the seventh when he made
a nice play covering first for an out after David Segui knocked
down a hard liner. Branyan then made a nice running catch on Nomar
Garciaparra to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez's three-run double with two outs in the fourth off Ohka
gave the Indians a 6-1 lead. Einar Diaz singled with one out and
Ohka walked Omar Vizquel with two down. Roberto Alomar then battled
the right-hander for nine pitches before walking.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez went ahead 3-0 in the count before lining his double
into the right-field gap.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox got a run back in the fifth on Troy O'Leary's RBI
groundout and Varitek's 10th homer brought Boston within 6-3 in the
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland blew it open in the seventh on Ramirez's homer and
Segui's 435-foot blast to center off Hector Carrasco.
</P>
<P>
   Branyan, who will be getting the bulk of the playing time in
left field with Wil Cordero out with a broken hand, put the Indians
up 2-0 in the second with his 15th homer.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland added another run in the inning on Vizquel's RBI
single.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox got a run back in the third on Troy O'Leary's RBI
double.
</P>
<P>
Notes: TV actor George Wendt, best known as Norm from ''Cheers''
was spotted having dinner in the Terrace Club in Jacobs Field. When
Wendt appeared on the stadium scoreboard, he raised a pint of beer
and toasted the crowd. ... Branyan has 15 homers in 136 at-bats.
... Boston manager Jimy Williams couldn't have been happy to see
seven TV cameras perched atop the wall in center. Last season,
Williams made the Indians cover one camera he thought they were
using to steal signs. ... Ramirez moved into sole possession of
third place on the Indians' career homer list with 227. He passed
Hall of Famer Earl Averill.

<HEADLINE> Teachers keep working under expired contract; negotiations continue </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Students and teachers were expected to
remain in school Thursday and Friday as labor negotiations between
Buffalo teachers and administrators continued to move toward a
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd have to say we're cautiously encouraged by the movement on
the part of the federation. That's not to say we've been rigid,''
said board of education spokesman Andrew Maddigan Wednesday night.
Maddigan said the school board was briefed by the district's
negotiating team for several hours Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Maddigan said he expected talks to resume Thursday in the labor
dispute that canceled classes for two days last week when teachers
abruptly struck, stranding the city's 47,000 students. School has
been in session since Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Buffalo Teachers Federation said the
union's executive board had gone home for the night and would
likely meet at 6 a.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   School Board President Paul Buchanan said contract talks between
the district and the teachers have come down to a handful of
issues, many of which, ''revolve around money.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's 3,700 teachers, meanwhile, continued to suspend their
strike and work under the terms of a contract that expired in June
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Offers and counteroffers center on the length of the contract
and salary increases. Late last week, the union was seeking 3.5
percent annual increases, while the district was offering 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The union also opposes health insurance concessions sought by
the district and the district's plan to contract with outside
agencies to provide social services to students and their families.
</P>
<P>
   While the district has obtained a preliminary injunction
ordering the teachers to refrain from striking, union leaders have
not ruled out another work stoppage.
</P>
<P>
   Rumore and other union leaders face potential jail terms for
calling the strike, illegal under the state's Taylor Law. Teachers
also face a fine of two days' pay for every day they strike. Court
hearings on contempt charges brought by the district are set for
Thursday and Friday.

Wen Ho Lee Could Still Sue
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Nuclear scientist Wen Ho Lee could still pursue a
civil lawsuit that claims the government invaded his privacy. Lee's attorney
says the plea agreement under which Lee was released today does not affect the
civil suit that's still on hold. Lee was set free today after pleading guilty to
one count under a deal in which prosecutors all but abandoned their crumbling
case against him, nine months after he was placed in solitary confinement as a
national security threat. U.S. District Judge James Parker said he was bound by
the plea agreement to sentence the fired Los Alamos scientist to 278 days, one
day less than he already has served since his arrest last December.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A confidant of Al Gore received an unsolicited package

Bush, turned the material over to his lawyer. The attorney gave the package to

Bush Vows To Spend $4.9B on Parks

   EVERETT, Wash. (AP) -- On the foggy banks of a salmon spawning ground, George
W. Bush promised to spend $4.9 billion on national parks that rival Al Gore had
left ''crumbling.'' He also criticized Gore for failing to take a stand on a hot
local debate over dams and endangered salmon. ''I think you deserve an answer,''
Bush, who opposes breaching the region's dams, told more than 100 supporters at
an invitation-only event. ''I think you need to know where he stands on this
important environmental issue.'' Seeking to regain his footing after weeks of
gains by Gore, Bush kicked off a three-day Western campaign swing on one of the
vice president's favorite subjects and in a region the Texas governor described
as a ''battleground of environment war and environmental policy.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Under an agreement with the Federal Aviation

pair of fatal accidents in Colorado and Pennsylvania. Three changes have
previously been mandated in 737 rudder controls and officials said they have had
no reports of rudder problems since. Because the redesign could take years, the
FAA will announce new training procedures for pilots on the more than 3,000

<HEADLINE> N. Korean Leader To Visit S. Korea  </HEADLINE>
By KYONG-HWA SEOK
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Senior officials of South and North
Korea worked out details Thursday on a visit to South Korea by
North Korean leader Kim Jong Il and other measures aimed at easing
tension on the divided Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Yong Sun, a visiting special envoy of the North Korean
leader, and his South Korean counterpart, Lim Dong-won, were
expected to issue a joint statement later Thursday after their
talks, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   They were trying to set dates for Kim Jong Il's Seoul visit, a
meeting of their defense ministers and more reunions of separated
families.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Yong Sun was to pay a courtesy call on South Korean
President Kim Dae-jung before returning home Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean pool reports, citing unnamed government officials,
said Wednesday that the two sides agreed to arrange for Kim Jong Il
to make his first visit to Seoul next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Both Koreas also will hold their first meeting of defense
ministers in Hong Kong later this month, said the pool reports.
</P>
<P>
   They will also hold another round of Red Cross talks in the
North as early as Monday to discuss more reunions of Koreans
separated from relatives since the 1950-53 Korean War, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The reports were filed by South Korean journalists. Foreign news
media were not included in the press pool organized by South Korean
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Jong Il had promised to visit Seoul in return for Kim
Dae-jung's visit to Pyongyang in June.
</P>
<P>
   Inter-Korea relations have warmed significantly since the June
summit, when Kim Dae-jung and Kim Jong Il pledged to put the past
behind and work together for peace. No North Korean head of state
has visited Seoul and the planned trip would be a new milestone in
improving ties.
</P>
<P>
   The Koreas allowed 200 people to cross the border in August for
temporary reunions with families they haven't seen for half a
century. Two more reunions are expected by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   The Koreas have also agreed to reconnect a cross-border railway
and let their athletes march together behind a unification flag
during the opening ceremonies at the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Yong Sun toured Cheju island off the southern coast on
Tuesday and Wednesday. Kim Jong Il reportedly wants to visit the
resort island during his trip.
</P>
<P>
   The Korean Peninsula was divided into communist North Korea and
pro-Western South Korea in 1945. Their 1950-53 Korean War ended
without a peace treaty, and their border remains the world's most
heavily fortified, with almost 2 million troops deployed on both
sides.

<P>
   FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- A motel handyman was convicted of murder
Wednesday for killing a Yosemite National Park naturalist but still
faces trial and a possible death penalty for allegedly killing
three tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Cary Stayner pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court to
kidnapping, attempting to sexually assault and killing Joie
Armstrong on July 21, 1999. In exchange for his plea to
first-degree murder, he will be sentenced in November to life in
prison with no chance of parole.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner displayed little emotion during a subdued 30-minute
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ''It brings back a lot of painful memories for him,'' his lawyer
Robert Rainwater said later. ''A young woman died in the prime of
her life and a young man will stand the rest of his life in prison.
And there are two grieving families.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement that Stayner, his lawyer and prosecutors signed
Sept. 6 requires that he take his story to his grave to spare the
family from any additional media attention. The only exception is
any testimony or communication with his lawyer regarding other
state or federal murder cases.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner also agreed to a $10 million restitution order to go to
a fund in Armstrong's name and to meet with her family if they
wish.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will never be a time when Joie will not be a vital part
of our lives,'' said a statement from the Armstrong family. ''Her
life was full of laughter and love and, at the time of her death,
she was enthusiastic about her future and was in the happiest
period of her life.''
</P>
<P>
   The plea is a pivotal stage in a case that has gained worldwide
attention, embarrassed the FBI and left federal and state
prosecutors quarreling. It shifts Stayner's fate to state court,
where prosecutors have been awaiting the chance to try him in the
slayings of three Yosemite tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner, 39, still faces the death penalty if convicted in the
slayings of Carole Sund, 42, her daughter Juli, 15, and their
Argentine friend Silvina Pelosso, 16.
</P>
<P>
   The women were killed five months before Armstrong, during a
sightseeing trip to Yosemite. They had been staying at the Cedar
Lodge, a remote and rustic motel outside the park's western gate
where Stayner lived and worked.
</P>
<P>
   It was their disappearance in February 1999 that prompted an FBI
manhunt, as scores of agents fanned out across the rugged and
rolling terrain of the western Sierra to search for clues.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner was interviewed early in the investigation but ruled out
as a suspect. He later helped agents collect evidence from the
motel rooms and was in their midst as the case unfolded and the
investigation went astray.
</P>
<P>
   Based on circumstantial evidence and what was later believed to
be a false confession, investigators plunged into the region's
methamphetamine netherworld and focused on a group of violent
ex-cons. At one point, an FBI agent said he was confident most of
the main suspects in the sightseer case were behind bars on other
charges.
</P>
<P>
   It was Stayner, arrested three days after Armstrong's murder,
who finally unraveled the mystery, admitting to a top FBI
interrogator that he killed all four women, according to court
documents. He also led investigators to weapons and other physical
evidence, and later re-enacted the crimes on videotape, according
to law enforcement sources.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariposa County District Attorney's office, which has
jurisdiction, can go forward with its case against Stayner as soon
as he is formally sentenced in Armstrong's murder.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas C. Hastings, a Santa Clara County judge who presided over
the high-profile Polly Klaas murder trial, has been assigned to
hear the sightseer case. But no hearing dates have been set, no
pleas entered, and an attorney has not been appointed or hired to
represent Stayner.

<HEADLINE> US Gymnast Hurts Ankle in Practice  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- With one gymnast already out with an
injury, the U.S. women's team got another scare when Jamie
Dantzscher rolled her right ankle during training.
</P>
<P>
   Dantzscher continued practicing Thursday (Wednesday night EDT)
after getting her ankle taped and said the injury isn't serious.
</P>
<P>
   ''It should be better by tomorrow, hopefully,'' she said. ''If
not, at least in a couple of days.''
</P>
<P>
   The women's team competition begins Sunday (Saturday night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   Dantzscher was doing a warmup dance move when she landed short
in a corner. She winced, but continued practicing for a few minutes
before taking a seat at the edge of the podium.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it's that bad,'' said Steve Rybacki, her coach.
''I saw her twist it and she didn't have her full weight on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dantzscher had a brief conversation with Rybacki, who is also
the U.S. assistant coach, and head coach Bela Karolyi before
hopping off the podium. She had her ankle taped during the team's
rest period and sat out again when the U.S. team moved to the
vault.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't want to pound on it right after that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But when the United States moved to the uneven bars, Dantzscher
rejoined her teammates. She ran through her routine without any
problems, taking a small step backward on her dismount.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a small surprise,'' Karolyi said. ''But I believe it's
a temporary difficulty. It's nothing we're concerned about very
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Dantzscher was in good spirits as she left the practice floor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm having fun,'' she said. ''The arena's really cool. You get
a good feeling when you walk in.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans have already had to replace one of their athletes.
Morgan White, one of the most consistent gymnasts on the team,
withdrew Tuesday because of a stress fracture in her left foot. She
was replaced by Tasha Schwikert, the second alternate.

<HEADLINE> TV Images Show Suspect Hit by Cops  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Three officers were placed on administrative duty
after live television shots showed them throwing a suspect to the
ground and punching and kicking him in the head Wednesday after a
high-speed chase.
</P>
<P>
   ''We saw some actions that concerned us,'' said Frank Boni,
assistant director of the Miami-Dade Police Department. ''If action
is warranted, we'll take it.''
</P>
<P>
   The chase began when a driver in a sport utility vehicle with
stolen plates flashed a gun at an officer, police said.
</P>
<P>
   During the chase, Miami television stations showed a
gunshot-pierced windshield on a pursuing police car. No officers
were hit by any gunfire, but one officer was struck by the SUV and
may have suffered a broken arm.
</P>
<P>
   Live helicopter shots showed a black SUV speeding down busy
streets and through residential neighborhoods from Miami-Dade
County north into Broward County. The SUV swerved through traffic
and up on sidewalks, narrowly missing cars and pedestrians before
being clipped by another car.
</P>
<P>
   The driver then drove into a neighborhood, where he jumped out
of the moving SUV and jumped a fence into a back yard. The vehicle
crashed into a front yard, the images showed.
</P>
<P>
   Television shots then showed an officer throwing the suspect
face down to the ground and punching him three times in the head.
Another officer ran up and kicked the suspect three times in the
head. Other officers arrived, handcuffed the suspect and led him
away.
</P>
<P>
   Police later identified the SUV driver as Jerome McCellion.
Charges against him were pending.
</P>
<P>
   The license tag on the SUV was reported stolen, but it is
unknown if the vehicle itself was stolen, Miami-Dade police Sgt.
Pete Andreau said.
</P>
<P>
   Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penelas issued a memo to Boni saying he
was troubled by the images and ''what initially appears to be
unnecessary force used by some officers.''
</P>
<P>
   Penelas also said he agreed with the decision to reassign
officers pending the outcome of the investigation.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals 9, Pirates 5  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Mark McGwire, hobbled by a sore knee, grounded
a single into the left-field corner that started a two-run first
inning and sent the St. Louis Cardinals over the Pittsburgh Pirates
9-5 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals completed a three-game sweep and cut their magic
number for clinching the NL Central to seven over Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh lost its fifth in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Ankiel (9-7) matched his career high for strikeouts with 11
in 6 2-3 innings. He has two wins in his last 10 starts, both over
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, listed in the starting lineup as the Cardinals'
shortstop and No. 2 hitter, singled off Todd Ritchie (8-8).
</P>
<P>
   The ball rolled into the corner and would have been a double for
most players. McGwire is slowed by patella tendinitis in his right
knee, a condition that sidelined him for more than two months.
</P>
<P>
   Because McGwire is unable to play in the field, manager Tony La
Russa has manipulated his lineup to get him to the plate in the
first inning of six consecutive road games. The slugging first
baseman is 2-for-5 with a home run since the plan went into effect
last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Edmonds followed with a single, and he and pinch-runner
Placido Polanco scored on Will Clark's double.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates tied it in the first on Keith Osik's two-run double.
Both runs were unearned because of second baseman Craig Paquette's
two-out error.
</P>
<P>
   Infield grounders by Ankiel and J.D. Drew scored runs in the
fourth for a 4-2 lead. Ray Lankford had an RBI single in the fifth
and Mike Matheny hit a sacrifice fly to make it 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds singled in a run in the sixth and Shawon Dunston hit a
two-run homer, his 12th, in the seventh. Dunston came into the game
to replace Lankford, who slightly strained his right hamstring
running to first base on a single.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Brown hit RBI singles in the fifth and seventh for
Pittsburgh. The Pirates had the bases loaded with nobody out in the
eighth but got just one run when John Wehner grounded into a double
play.
</P>
<P>
Notes: McGwire has been officially listed as the Cardinals'
starting second baseman, right fielder and shortstop since La Russa
started his plan. Wednesday was his first appearance as the
shortstop. ... Aside from the two wins over the Pirates, Ankiel has
two losses and six no-decisions in his last 10 starts. ... Ritchie
had won three of his last four decisions.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Herbert Friedman, an astrophysicist whose
work resulted in the discovery of X-ray sources outside the solar
system, died Saturday of cancer. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman published roughly 300 papers during his 60-year career
and was awarded the National Science Medal, the nation's top
scientific prize, in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   His work in the field of rocket astronomy, which he helped
pioneer in the late 1940s, led to a better understanding of the
sun's activities, including solar flares and their effect on radio
communications and weather.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, he discovered X-rays from the Crab Nebula, the remains
of a supernova explosion.

</P>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. (AP) -- George Oakley, one of the city's most loyal
boosters and founder of Viking Tours, died Sunday of lung cancer.
He was 71.
</P>
<P>
   It was nearly 40 years ago when Oakley bought an old school bus
and offered the first public, narrated tours of Newport. That
venture led to Viking Motor Tours, a family-run business that now
has 28 vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley was among the first to recognize the significance of the
Tall Ships in Newport when they visited in 1976. He chartered a
fleet of boats throughout New England to provide passengers with a
water view of the classic ships.
</P>
<P>
   He also operated spectator boats for the America's Cup Races
from 1970 through 1983.
</P>
<P>
   He was on the board of directors of the Newport County Chamber
of Commerce and was vice chairman of the Newport Tourist and
Convention Authority, now the Newport County Convention and
Visitors Bureau.

</P>
<P>
   UTRECHT, Netherlands (AP) -- Jan Sariman, a former Surinamese
minister who fled to the Netherlands in 1983 as a political
refugee, committed suicide Monday on the eve of his embezzlement
trial. He was in his early 50s.

<HEADLINE> Cops Rule Out Ramsey in Sex Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Boulder police have ruled out a connection
between a 1997 sexual assault on a 14-year-old girl and the 1996
slaying of JonBenet Ramsey.
</P>
<P>
   Police began investigating a possible link in May after a
newspaper article suggested police may have overlooked a
connection.
</P>
<P>
   The 14-year-old victim in the September 1997 case attended the
same dance academy as JonBenet, and lived within two miles of the
Ramseys' home. The victim in the 1997 attack reported being
sexually assaulted by an intruder who may have been lurking in her
home for hours. The girl's mother interrupted the attack and no
suspect was ever identified.
</P>
<P>
   A palm print found at the Ramsey crime scene does not match a
palm print discovered in the 14-year-old's home, police Chief Mark
Beckner said Tuesday. Despite some parallels between the two
unsolved cases, Beckner said police ''have found no connection.''
</P>
<P>
   Six-year-old JonBenet was found beaten and strangled in the
basement of her parents' Boulder home Dec. 26, 1996. A grand jury
investigating her death adjourned last year with no indictments
issued.
</P>
<P>
   Beckner also said investigators have more work to do following
their August interviews with JonBenet's parents, John and Patsy
Ramsey, who remain under suspicion in their daughter's death.
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys' lawyer, Lin Wood, said they have agreed not to
release tapes of the interviews ''at this time'' because they want
to cooperate with officers who believe the releasing would
jeopardize the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The two-day session in Atlanta, where the Ramseys live now, was
the first time the parents and police had talked since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Wood released a short portion of the interview in which a
prosecutor grew agitated during an exchange with Wood. District
Attorney Alex Hunter and Beckner asked Wood not to release any
more.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A pregnant woman was killed and her 4-year-old
daughter was injured when they were struck by a street sweeping
truck Wednesday in downtown Washington, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-year-old woman, identified by police as Felietia Sorto,
was crossing 13th Street at N Street with her daughter and a
grocery cart when she was hit.
</P>
<P>
   The girl, Onis Morlenis-Arbaizn, and the cart were pulled into
the machine and ejected out of it. Sorto got caught up in the
sweeper's brushes and had to be pulled out by rescue workers.
Workers held up sheets around the sweeper during the rescue to
shield the gruesome process from onlookers.
</P>
<P>
   Sorto was pronounced dead at the scene. Her daughter was taken
to Children's Hospital with minor injuries and admitted for
observation.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how the accident occurred. The sweeper reaches a
top speed of only 20 mph.

<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Cal Ripken had four hits and rookie
Chris Richard drove in five runs as the Baltimore Orioles beat the
Texas Rangers 9-4 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken's first-inning single gave him 3,054 hits, moving him
past Rod Carew into 18th place on the career list. Ripken later
moved past Robin Yount for 12th place in all-time doubles with 584.
</P>
<P>
   Richard has nine homers and 26 RBIs in 42 games since he was
acquired in a trade with the St. Louis Cardinals on July 29.
</P>
<P>
   Richard hit a two-run double in the first, a two-run single in
the third and added a sacrifice fly in the fourth. He also was hit
by a pitch in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles won for the first time in six games at Texas this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Rapp (8-11) allowed four runs and five hits over 5 2-3
innings. He had lost five of his previous six decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore scored three times in the first off rookie Ryan Glynn
(5-4) on Richard's two-run double and Brook Fordyce's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   After Texas got a run in the second on Bill Haselman's RBI
double, Richard's two-run single in the third made it 5-1. Rusty
Greer hit a two-run double in the Rangers third.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles chased Glynn in the fourth on Ripken's RBI single.
Richard's sacrifice fly off reliever Jonathan Johnson made it 7-3.
</P>
<P>
   Texas cut the deficit to 7-4 in the sixth on Ricky Ledee's
run-scoring triple.
Notes: Ripken had his 27th career four-hit game. His last came on
Sept. 10, 1999. ... Ripken has 241 career hits against Texas,
putting him third among Rangers opponents behind George Brett (291)
and Paul Molitor (254). ... Richard fell one short of his career
high for RBIs set on Sept. 3. ... Texas' Rafael Palmeiro hit his
450th career double.

<HEADLINE> Report: Minn. Woman To Plead Guilty  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The woman who admitted helping Minnesota
basketball players cheat on their schoolwork will plead guilty to a
charge of misappropriating funds, WCCO-TV said Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   WCCO, citing unidentified sources, reported that former tutor
Jan Gangelhoff has agreed to plead guilty as early as Friday to one
felony count and testify before a grand jury. In exchange, federal
prosecutors will ask that she not receive any prison time.
</P>
<P>
   Gangelhoff revealed in March 1999 that she wrote more than 400
research papers and tests for about 20 players. Her revelation led
to an investigation that has resulted in former coach Clem Haskins'
ouster, university-imposed sanctions, inquiries by federal
authorities and the NCAA and the departure of two administrators.
</P>
<P>
   The charge to which Gangelhoff will plead relates to federal
grant money given to former guard Bobby Jackson, who now plays for
the Sacramento Kings, the station reported. Prosecutors will argue
that by doing Jackson's work, Gangelhoff enabled him to collect
Pell Grant student aid.
</P>
<P>
   The federal investigation reportedly centers on Haskins. Alonzo
Newby, a former academic counselor in the men's basketball program,
also is a target.
</P>
<P>
   WCCO said key witnesses will testify before a federal grand jury
in Minneapolis next week, including Gangelhoff and her sister, Jean
Payer, who also was a tutor at the university.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the university sued Haskins to recover the $1.5
million it paid to buy out his contract, saying the coach lied when
he denied giving $3,000 to Gangelhoff and that he told players to
mislead investigators after the scandal broke. Haskins attorney
said the university's allegations are false.

<HEADLINE> Butler To Challenge Aryan Judgment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho (AP) -- Aryan Nations leader Richard Butler
on Wednesday filed a notice of his intent to appeal last week's
$6.3 million judgment against his white supremacist sect.
</P>
<P>
   The move was expected to delay by at least two weeks the
court-ordered seizure of property from the group's northern Idaho
compound near Hayden Lake, Kootenai County Sheriff Rocky Watson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Butler, his organization and its corporate entity, Saphire,
Inc., were found negligent in selecting and overseeing security
guards who assaulted a mother and son, Victoria and Jason Keenan,
outside the compound in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A copy of the appeal notice, which Watson sent to reporters,
indicates Butler did not post an appeal bond that would shield
Aryan Nations property from seizure pending the outcome of the
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   On the notice, Butler states that he is exempt from paying
various filing fees due to indigence. A handwritten portion says
the appeal to the Idaho Supreme Court is expected to be based on
''all issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs lawyer Kenneth B. Howard, reached at his Coeur
d'Alene home, said he expected to prevail in any appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Morris Dees, the civil rights lawyer who led the plaintiffs'
legal team, has said he expected the judgment to bring a quick end
to the Aryan Nations and its racist, anti-Semitic message.
</P>
<P>
   A court order giving the sheriff's department authority to seize
assets was signed Tuesday, and Watson had indicated he planned to
begin removing property from the compound in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Butler has been ordered to appear at an Oct. 13 hearing to
testify under oath about his assets.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian sailors show national pride in effort to promote homeland </HEADLINE>
By NATASHA GURAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) - For now the Bat'kivshchyna is docked in
Connecticut, but the ship's soul is firmly anchored in its native
Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   The 80-foot black-hulled gaff-rigged schooner whose name means
''Motherland'' in Ukrainian is stalled in the midst of a sometimes
tumultuous voyage with a message as strong as the storms it has
endured.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our country is very new but has an old heritage,'' Dmytro
Biriukovich, the ship's 63-year-old captain, said in his native
tongue Tuesday. ''We lost our independence, but now we are a free
country. We want people to know what Ukraine is.''
</P>
<P>
   With the blue and yellow Ukrainian flag at its helm, the cement
ship that Biriukovich rebuilt from a fishing trawler 10 years ago
is showing signs of wear from it difficulties at sea.
</P>
<P>
   But the crew from Kiev beams with pride that districts visitors
from its rough exterior and turns their focus to the colorful
culture that Biriukovich wants the world to recognize.
</P>
<P>
   Russia traces its roots to the Kievan state of Rus in the 9th
century, but for most of the time that followed, Ukraine had been
dominated by Moscow. For seven decades, Ukraine was a republic of
the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, leaders from both nations have made efforts to
improve relations, focusing on a Slavic brotherhood.
</P>
<P>
   Clad in a traditional white shirt with red embroidery,
Biriukovich's wife, Nina, takes visitors down the steps at the
front of the ship into the cramped master sleeping quarters.
</P>
<P>
   She shows off a bottle of vodka shaped like a Cossack and
clutches a golden key chain embossed with the image of the Orthodox
saint, Michael (Mikhail).
</P>
<P>
   ''St. Michael blesses us on our voyage,'' Nina Biriukovich says
in Ukrainian, her green eyes about to well with tears. ''There is a
new statue of St. Michael in the center of Kiev. Everyone prays to
him there, and we pray to him here.''
</P>
<P>
   On April 7, the Biriukoviches - both retired civil engineers -
and the rest of the crew set sail on the icy Dnieper River.
Bombarded by storms and lost at sea with a failed communications
system, the Bat'kivshchyna missed the first in a series of OpSail
events in San Juan, Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course it wasn't all easy,'' said Nina Biriukovich, 64.
''But we persevered. Ukrainians are very strong people.''
</P>
<P>
   Atop the ship's tallest mast waves an American flag. During
stops in countries including Italy, Spain and Turkey, the crew
raised the native flag honoring the people that welcomed them to
their ports.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here in America are very soulful, generous and kind people,''
said Nina Biriukovich. ''People ask, 'What can we do? How can we
help? What can we bring?' It makes me cry.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, two men stopped by to help repair an engine, and a
woman took Nina Biriukovich to the store so she could buy cucumbers
and tomatoes to make a traditional salad.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to thank everyone,'' Dmytro Biriukovich said.
</P>
<P>
   The city is allowing the Bat'kivshchyna to remain docked here
until the Amistad freedom schooner returns next week. The Thames
Shipyard donated a dry dock for repairs.
</P>
<P>
   The Bat'kivshchyna has been offered a winter home in Norwich.
The city and the chairman of the Norwich Harbor Management
Commission - co-owners of the large-vessel ferry dock - said the
tall ship can stay until April.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut Friends of Ukraine Expedition worked to raise
and collect some $8,500 when the Bat'kivshchyna's finances
dwindled. Now CFUE has teamed up with the New Haven chapter of
Children of Chornobyl Relief Fund in an effort to raise tens of
thousands of dollars to send the ship to a Great Lakes tall ships
festival next spring. Plans for the Great Lakes Tall Ships
Challenge include stops in eight ports from Oswego, N.Y. to
Muskegon, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was such a warm response in southern Connecticut where
there is a small Ukrainian-American population compared to the
Great Lakes area,'' said Alex Kuzma, executive director of the New
Haven chapter of CCRF. ''The Bat'kivshchyna is really a symbol of
the resilience and the forward-looking of these people.''
</P>
<P>
   During OpSail festivities here, large crowds gathered around the
Bat'kivshchyna as crew members donned velvet Ukrainian Cossack
suits and sang folk songs.
</P>
<P>
   Tugging at his graying beard the ship's cook, Lenoid Deragin
longed for his homeland. His wife and two children are back home.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the 52-year-old retired civil engineer said that after 35
years of traditional work, he needed a change.
</P>
<P>
   He says he has lived his life without regrets. Perhaps he has
just one as it pertains to this visit.
</P>
<P>
   ''My mother told me to study English,'' he said in Ukrainian.
''I guess I should have listened.''
</P>
<P>
   As the sun belted his bare chest Tuesday, Deragin recalled the
trip from its frigid start.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love all weather because I love life. I am very happy. The
sea puts your soul at peace,'' he said. ''Being a guest here is
great, but I belong to Ukraine.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Confidant Gets Bush Package  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A package containing documents and a videotape
relating to George W. Bush's debate preparations was mysteriously
delivered to a Gore confidant Wednesday. The FBI was asked to
investigate.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether the material was legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Downey, a former congressman who has been helping the vice
president prepare for debates against Bush, turned the material
over to his lawyer. The attorney gave the package to the FBI to
determine whether the documents and tape were ''illegally obtained
from the Bush campaign,'' said Gore spokesman Mark Fabiani.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly, this is something that should not have been sent to
me,'' Downey said in a statement. ''I have directed that all of the
materials be turned over to law enforcement officials where they
can deal with them appropriately.''
</P>
<P>
   Fabiani said Gore's staff did not know for certain whether the
package was a hoax or actual Bush campaign material. Downey,
however, has told associates he is convinced the material is
legitimate, in part because he saw Bush in what appeared to be a
mock debate with Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., who is serving as Gore's
stand-in during Bush debate sessions, according to two Democratic
lawyers who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The package came with a postmark from Austin, Texas, home of
Bush's headquarters. The return address included a sender's name
but Downey did not recognize it, his attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Using these materials was never an option,'' said Downey, who
had been playing Bush in Gore's debate preparations ''To do so
would dishonor a great American tradition of open and honest
debates.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore chairman William Daley called Bush chairman Don Evans to
notify him about the package.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said: ''We would like to review the
material. Our attorneys have asked to review it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush communications director Karen Hughes said the campaign is
not conducting an internal investigation because people who had
''legitimate access'' to the tapes were very few. ''So obviously we
don't feel that ... they came from our staff,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the revelation unsettled the famously loyal Bush
campaign, which has been slipping in polls and struggling to stay
on message since the Democratic convention in August. Several
advisers said they could not imagine that the documents could come
from inside the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign attorneys have asked the FBI for access to the
materials to view them and determine if they are authentic.
</P>
<P>
   Downey's attorney Marc Miller said he rejected a request by Bush
lawyer Ben Ginsberg to review the materials. ''The FBI is in a
better position to determine what should be done about this,''
Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   FBI spokesman Bill Carter said, ''The preliminary information
provided to the FBI is being assessed to determine which, if any,
federal statutes are applicable.''
</P>
<P>
   The development came on the eve of a meeting between officials
with the Gore and Bush campaigns that could result in a schedule of
fall debates. The meeting is set to be held at the offices of the
Commission on Presidential Debates in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Fabiani disclosed the development to The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The package arrived by mail at Downey's office in Washington at
10:28 a.m. EDT Wednesday. He opened the package, which contained a
videotape and documents that appeared to relate to the Bush
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Downey notified Miller, who took the documents about 11:15 a.m.
and called the FBI. Miller later said two FBI agents picked up the
package from his office. Fabiani said Downey has decided to stop
participating in debate preparations.
</P>
<P>
   Downey has not disclosed to campaign officials what is in the
package, Fabiani said. Miller also refused to detail the contents
in an interview with the AP.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Bush adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the campaign does have videotapes of Gore's past debates, Bush's
past debates and Bush's debate preparation sessions.
</P>
<P>
   There are also internal documents that detail potential
strategies against Gore, said the official, who added that it was
inconceivable that the information was leaked to a Gore partisan.
</P>
<P>
   The situation was somewhat reminiscent of a case in which debate
documents from President Carter's 1980 re-election campaign turned
up later in the files of Republican challenger Ronald Reagan. That
was never fully explained, despite an FBI investigation.

<HEADLINE> Aliens Rescued from Cyprus Coast  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) -- More than 250 immigrants were rescued
after their ramshackle boat sank Wednesday off the western Cyprus
coast, police said. There are no reports of any serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people relaxing on a beach near the resort town of
Paphos first alerted authorities to the foundering craft and then
watched the rescue drama from shore.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the coast guard brought all those aboard the boat
safely to shore.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the boat, believed to mainly be carrying Iraqi Kurds
and Syrians, departed from Lebanon and was bound for Italy when it
ran into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Local media reports said each immigrant had paid $4,000 to the
boat's four-member crew to take them to Italy. The reports said the
crew abandoned the boat before it entered Cyprus waters. There was
no immediate official confirmation of the media reports.
</P>
<P>
   There has been several incidents in the past few years of
boatloads of immigrants, most from the Middle East and Africa,
ending up on Cyprus shores after their boats break down en route to
Greece or Italy.

<P>
   YUMA, Ariz. (AP) -- An instructor and a student at a military
parachute training school were killed during a nighttime jump,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the accident, which happened late Tuesday, wasn't
known, said Chuck Wullenjohn, a spokesman for the Army's Yuma
Proving Ground.
</P>
<P>
   The victims were identified as Tech. Sgt. Christopher Sheaffer,
an instructor at the Military Freefall School, and a student --
Engineman First Class Shawn Mustard, 31, of the Naval Amphibious
Base Little Creek in Norfolk, Va. Mustard's hometown is Morrow,
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Sheaffer's age was not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators from Fort Bragg, N.C., and Fort Rucker, Ala., will
investigate the accident at the school, which teaches advanced
parachute techniques to all branches of the military.
</P>
<P>
   The school has been at the Yuma Proving Ground since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1999, another student at the school was killed when his
parachute malfunctioned.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Airlines plane forced to return to JFK after bomb threat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A plane reportedly carrying the president of
Pakistan was forced to turn around and land at John F. Kennedy
International Airport late Wednesday after a bomb threat was phoned
in.
</P>
<P>
   Port Authority spokesman Alan Hicks said the Boeing 747 took off
for Pakistan from Kennedy Airport Wednesday night with 121
passengers and crew aboard. Pakistan International Airlines Flight
722 was scheduled to leave New York at 9 p.m. on its way to
Manchester, England, and then on to Karachi.
</P>
<P>
   At some point after takeoff, a bomb threat was received, and the
plane turned around and landed at Kennedy shortly before 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks said authorities were in the process of removing
passengers and luggage from the craft late Wednesday. Luggage would
then be matched to passengers. No further incidents were
immediately reported.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks said K-9 units would then check the plane for anything
unusual. He said the plane would be moved to an isolated area,
adding that he was ''very confident'' that nothing else would
happen.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks said dogs had checked the luggage before it had taken off.
</P>
<P>
   A call to the Consulate General of Pakistan in New York was not
immediately returned.

<HEADLINE> Trial Lawyer at Center of Dispute  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A trial lawyer at the center of a dispute with
Texas over tobacco litigation has given hundreds of thousands of
dollars from his law firm to the Democratic Party over the last
four years since Vice President Al Gore was asked to call him to
seek a six-figure check.
</P>
<P>
   A Gore aide said Wednesday the vice president never made the
phone call to Texas trial lawyer Walter Umphrey.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was asked to make the call in 1995 by a Democratic National
Committee official after having had dinner in Texas with trial
lawyers -- at a time when they were concerned with Republican
legislation that would have put limits on lawsuit awards.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic call sheets that recently have been scrutinized by
Justice Department investigators suggest Gore and former Democratic
Party chairman Don Fowler were asked to solicit Umphrey for
contributions beginning in late 1995. The interest of the Justice
Department fund-raising task force in the call sheets was described
by a federal law enforcement source, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The task force is headed by Robert Conrad, who previously called
for a special counsel to investigate Gore in the fund-raising
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno rejected the recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Umphrey and his law firm have donated $790,000 to the Democratic
Party since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The call sheet to Fowler suggests the trial lawyer was waiting
until after President Clinton followed through with a veto of tort
reform litigation before sending money to the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   One of the call sheets to Fowler suggested language he could use
in a call to the lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sorry you missed the Vice President,'' states the call sheet.
''I know will give $100K whn the President vetos Tort reform, but
we really need it now. Please send ASAP if possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the preparation of the Dec. 13, 1995 call sheet,
another document shows Gore was asked to call Umphrey and solicit a
donation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Republicans and others have had this material for more than
1,000 days and no one thought this was interesting until 1,000
hours before the election,'' said Gore spokesman Jim Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   A Gore aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the vice
president did not make the call. The aide dismissed the notion of
any improper connection between the vice president and Umphrey's
donations.
</P>
<P>
   Umphrey is one of five trial lawyers at the center of a legal
dispute between the Republican Texas attorney general and attorneys
who represented the state in litigation to recover money from
tobacco companies for health care costs.
</P>
<P>
   The trial lawyers are receiving $3.3 billion for the tobacco
case. Texas Attorney General John Cornyn, a Republican, is
challenging them and seeking to question five lawyers including
Umphrey who negotiated the state's tobacco settlement.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Brush Blazes Burn 5,200 Acres  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AGUA DULCE, Calif. (AP) -- Five wind-driven fires sent walls of
flame roaring over at least 5,200 acres of Southern California
brush Wednesday, destroying at least three homes and threatening
more than a dozen others.
</P>
<P>
   The fires dotted an area stretching hundreds of miles, from San
Diego to an Air Force base more than 100 miles north of Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen homes were evacuated in the Agua Dulce area about 50
miles northeast of Los Angeles after the homes were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   One of the last people out of the area, Dan Dawson, said the
fire destroyed a shed containing his six motorcycles, all
uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was the last one out of here,'' he said. ''I was trying to
get as much as I could. Even the fire department pushed me out of
the way.''
</P>
<P>
   The blaze had burned some 400 acres, while the other fires were
not immediately threatening any homes. No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   The blazes broke out during a second day of scorching
temperatures across Southern California.

<HEADLINE> Federal officer accused of trying to arrange a murder  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - A federal prison guard who found
romance online asked an inmate to help him find a hit man to bump
off a rival, prosecutors said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the guard, the inmate went to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Norval of Hamlin, Pa., a correction officer at the
federal prison in Otisville, N.Y., was arrested Tuesday and charged
with murder for hire and murder conspiracy, which are punishable by
10 and 25 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said Norval wanted to find someone
who would kill a person in Mexico ''who would interfere with
Norval's relationship with a woman in Mexico whom he had met on the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   He reached out to an inmate at Otisville, but the inmate
reported the approach and arranged for Norval to call an undercover
officer in Texas, White said. The undercover officer posed as a
relative of the inmate and Norval solicited the murder, the
prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
   Norval was arrested by agents from the Justice Department's
Office of the Inspector General. He was arraigned in White Plains
and was held pending a bail hearing scheduled for Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''American law enforcement officers who violate their trust are
few and far between,'' said Glenn Fine, acting inspector general.
''But when we identify ones that do, the (inspector's office) will
vigorously investigate and prosecute.''

<HEADLINE> Tex. Budgets $4M for Kids' Health  </HEADLINE>
By CONNIE MABIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- In a move which followed criticism of Gov.
George W. Bush's health care policies, the Texas Health and Human
Services Commission on Wednesday announced an increase in its
budget.
</P>
<P>
   The commission said it had allocated an additional $4 million to
its state budget for Children's Health Insurance Program outreach.
</P>
<P>
   The extra money comes two weeks after a federal judge blasted
the state for failing to solve problems with its children's
Medicaid program, and as Bush, the Republican presidential nominee,
countered accusations that he was not doing enough to give poor
Texans access to health care.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has defended the state's Medicaid program, and his campaign
has cited the health program as one way his administration has
tried to get children insured.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has the nation's second-highest rate of uninsured
children. Some 1.4 million of the nearly 11 million children
nationwide who lack health insurance are Texans. Only Arizona has a
worse rate.
</P>
<P>
   Commission spokesman Charles Stuart said the budget decision was
not political and that there had been no pressure from Bush's
office to spend more on publicizing the program.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're just trying to increase our outreach efforts,'' Stuart
said. ''Our plans and our goals are not influenced by any election
cycle.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Mike Jones also denied politics played a role.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is just a prudent, common-sense decision by the Health
and Human Services Commission,'' he said. ''The program still has
plenty of room to grow and in a state as big and as diverse as
Texas, this is a reasonable step to help spread the word.''

<HEADLINE> Albright: US Will Threaten Force  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The United States will back vigorous diplomacy
with a threat of force to preserve stability through the Middle
East and Persian Gulf, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   While Albright did not identify the potential targets in a
speech to a Jewish group, a senior U.S. official said the United
States would take military action if Iraq rebuilt its arsenals of
dangerous weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Albright harshly criticized Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on
Tuesday in her last official speech Tuesday to the United Nations.
She urged the countries of the world to ''stand up to the campaign
launched by Baghdad against the U.N.'s authority and international
law.''
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference afterward, Albright denounced Saddam as a
villain. She said she was not threatening force if Iraq did not
permit a new U.N. inspection commission under Hans Blix, a Swedish
arms control expert, to look for hidden weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   But she also said ''we have our red lines'' and that the United
States did not want to see Iraq rebuild its weapons arsenals, take
action against the Kurds or ''threaten the neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Her statement Wednesday to the Conference of Presidents of Major
American Jewish Organizations indicated force was a U.S. option in
such circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the senior U.S. official who briefed State
Department reporters here said the penalty Iraq would pay if it
defied U.N. inspectors was continued economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the United States and Britain conducted air
strikes to punish Iraq for refusing to cooperate with weapons
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   The administration evidently is not looking for another
confrontation with Saddam over inspections. But Albright's
reference to ''red lines'' appears to indicate the United States
could use force if Iraq crosses those unspecified red lines.

<HEADLINE> Flame Thrower Wins in Del Mar  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEL MAR, Calif. (AP) -- Flame Thrower edged Street Cry by a head
Wednesday in the $250,000 Del Mar Futurity, giving trainer Bob
Baffert his fifth straight victory in the race for 2-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Flame Thrower, the even-money favorite ridden by Jerry Bailey,
ran seven furlongs in 1:22, just two-fifths of a second off the
stakes record set by Forest Camp in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Flame Thrower paid $4, $2.80 and $2.10 for his third victory in
three career starts. Street Cry returned $3.40 and $2.40, and
Arabian Light paid $2.60 to show.
</P>
<P>
   Bought for $270,000 last April at the Ocala sale, Flame Thrower
earned $150,000 for the win, running the colt's earnings to
$268,200. Flame Thrower won a maiden race on July 26, then took the
Best Pal Stakes on Aug. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert also saddled the winners of the Del Mar Futurity in
1996-99: Silver Charm, followed by Souvenir Copy, Worldy Manner and
Forest Camp.
</P>
<P>
   The trainer and Bailey also teamed to win Wednesday's supporting
feature on closing day of the Del Mar meeting, taking the $75,887
race with 1-5 favorite Chilukki, who won by five lengths.

<HEADLINE> Show To Debut Without Commercials  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The doctor is in and the ads are out for the
new ABC medical drama ''Gideon's Crossing.''
</P>
<P>
   The series' first episode will air without commercial
interruption Oct. 11, the network said Wednesday. The hourlong show
will feature a single sponsor, health care conglomerate Johnson &AMP;
Johnson, offering brief messages at the beginning and end of the
program.
</P>
<P>
   ''With attention spans shorter and viewers surfing TV as much as
watching it, ABC has taken this special episode of 'Gideon's
Crossing' and treated it in a special way,'' said Andrea Alstrup, a
Johnson &AMP; Johnson executive.
</P>
<P>
   The company did not disclose what it was paying to sponsor the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Alstrup spoke at a news conference attended by series star Andre
Braugher (''Homicide: Life on the Street'') and co-stars including
Ruben Blades and Eric Dane. Braugher plays Dr. Ben Gideon, chief of
experimental surgery at a Boston teaching hospital.
</P>
<P>
   A broadcast network drama has never aired without commercial
breaks, ABC said.

<HEADLINE> Florence still could strengthen again, threaten Bermuda  </HEADLINE>

<P>
   MIAMI (AP) - Hurricane Florence weakened into a tropical storm
Wednesday, a day after being blamed for at least two deaths in
North Carolina, but forecasters said the system could regenerate
into a hurricane and threaten Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
   ''Florence will have an opportunity to restrengthen to hurricane
status once it begins to move away from its present location toward
warmer waters,'' said Lixion Avila, a hurricane specialist at the
National Hurricane Center in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Florence, which had sustained winds of 70 mph, remained a
slow-moving mass of wind and rain off the southeast United States
late Wednesday. The storm has moved slightly to the west since
developing into a hurricane Tuesday, but was forecast to move to
the east-northeast and away from the U.S. mainland in the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Avila said Bermuda should monitor Florence's progress and a
hurricane watch may be required early Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At 11 p.m. EDT, Florence, the sixth named storm of the 2000
Atlantic hurricane season, was centered near latitude 30.2 north,
longitude 73.3 west, or about 525 miles west-southwest of Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
   A tropical wave in the Caribbean also has forecasters on alert.
The wave could become a tropical depression within the next 24
hours, meteorologist Eric Blake said. It is located southeast of
Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula and is moving to the northwest between
10 and 15 mph, Blake said.
</P>
<P>
   A man and a woman died at Kure Beach, N.C., and seven other
people were rescued Tuesday after strong rip currents associated
with Florence caught swimmers by surprise. Another man was missing
after falling out of a kayak at Carolina Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said they did not intend to reopen two beaches
closed Tuesday until Florence is no longer a threat.
</P>
<P>
   ''Florence will continue to generate dangerous surf and rip
tides along portions of the southeastern U.S. coast,'' Avila said.
