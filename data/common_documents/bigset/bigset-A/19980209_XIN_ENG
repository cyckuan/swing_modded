MOSCOW, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Relations between Russia and the
United States haven't deteriorated despite the two countries'
differences over weapons inspections in Iraq, Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov said here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Primakov made the remarks in an exclusive interview with the
Russian TV station, reported Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Foreign Minister said that Moscow's opposition to
any military action against Iraq does not mean its opposition
to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Russia is against the use of force on Iraq. And his country and
the U.S. shared the same view on the elimination of weapons of
mass destruction in Iraq, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Primakov stressed that maintaining good relations with the
U.S. serves Russia's interests. A steady development of
Russia-U.S. relations should only be based on an equal footing, he
added.

Primakov expressed his hope that UN Secretary-General Kofi
Annan's scheduled visit to Iraq will be realized.

He said that Russia hoped to see the Iraqi crisis develop in
an optimistic way.

<HEADLINE> Britain Steps Up Pressure on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Britain Sunday stepped up its
pressure on Iraq as two of the country's high-ranking officials
warned Saddam that time was running out and air attacks could
weaken his personal hold on power.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports quoted Foreign Secretary Robin Cook as
telling BBC television that the US and Britain would resort to
force sooner rather than later unless Saddam provided free access
to United Nations arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
"The deadline (for compliance with the UN) is getting closer
and closer, and he (Saddam) will be making a big mistake if he
thinks that we are going to back down," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Saddam's own grip on power would be weakened and
Iraq could lose a lot of its own military assets if the air strike
did take place.
</P>
<P>
But Cook refused to say how long it would be before the US and
the UK would strike, only saying it would not last for months.
</P>
<P>
A BBC television report also quoted Defense Secretary George
Robertson as saying that "any use of force is going to be designed
to get at his (Saddam's) own power base."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a spokesman of the Defense Ministry said Sunday that
Britain was preparing to send attack planes to the Gulf, but none
of the eight Tormados detailed for the Iraq standoff had arrived
in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that the eight Tornados could be expected
to arrive in the next few days.

<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The economy in Slovak Republic
kept on with the trend of recovery in 1997 and showed a good
future, official statistics said.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics released recently by the National
Statistics Bureau, the total output value of the republic
increased 6.1 percent last year compared with the figures of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The year of 1997 saw an increasing export, a prosperous market
and a stablized currency in the country, the statistics said. The
living standard of people was also improved.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the main reason for the success of Slovak was
that the government readjusted the country's structure of
production, promote the export and strictly controlled the
expenditure and monetary issue.
</P>
<P>
But the foundation of further increase in still unstable in the
republic although its economy was recovering, related analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
Some of the problems still need to be solved, they said,
citing the high unemployment rate which was 12.8 percent in 1997,
and the remarkable foreign debt which totalled 10.3 billion U.S.
dollars last year.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Calls for Dialog among </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami Sunday reiterated his call for dialog among civilizations
so to kick away political confrontation, hoping that the next
century will feature cultural communication among nations.
</P>
<P>
Receiving Colombian Minister of Culture Ramiro Osorio Funska
here, Khatami said in the 20th century "politics have dominated
religion and culture, but if politics and military forces are
brought under control of the culture, the destiny of human beings
will change."
</P>
<P>
"We hope to enter into a process (in 21st century) that dialog
between the civilizations and understanding among the nations will
prevail instead of the current confrontation among the
civilizations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Khatami made his appeal for dialogs among civilizations at the
summit of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) held
here last December. He also called for cultural dialog between the
Iranian and American peoples although relations between the two
countries were strained since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Khatami also told Funska that Colombia as the chairman of the
Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) and Iran as the OIC chairman could
cooperate to assume a decisive role on the international scene.
</P>
<P>
In the meeting, Funska handed over a message from Colombian
President Ernesto Samper Pizano to Khatami, saying that Colombia
is willing to develop cooperation with Iran.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that his negotiations with Iranian
officials in Tehran would serve to boost bilateral relations in
cultural, scientific, art and economic areas.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian official is here at the invitation of Iranian
Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance Ataollah Mohajerani, the
official IRNA news agency reported. However, it did not mention
when Funska arrived here and how long he would stay.

<HEADLINE> Iran Urges Algeria to Announce Clear Stand Toward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi Sunday urged the Algerian government
to announce a clear stand toward massacres of the innocent people
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi was quoted by the Iranian official news agency IRNA
as saying that the negative reaction of the Algerian government to
the international community's concern has given a rise to the
suspicion of the world public opinion about the massacres.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian government should not block the humanitarian
efforts of international organizations to probe into the
suspicious massacres of defenseless people in Algeria, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, hundreds of Algerian
people have been cruelly slain by unidentified gunmen, arousing
great concern of the international communities.
</P>
<P>
As the chairman of the Organization of the Islamic Conference
(OIC), Iran called for international efforts to put an immediate
end to the bloodshed and voiced its readiness and willingness to
offer every possible assistance for curbing bloodshed in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian government has insisted that no foreign meddling
should be allowed over the killings since the issue is an internal
affairs of the country.
</P>
<P>
Blaming the stance of the Algerian government, some Iranian
officials and mass media alleged that the Algerian government had
a hand in the massacres of Muslims in the country.
</P>
<P>
At least 75,000 people have died in Algeria since an Islamic
insurgency erupted in 1992 when the government canceled elections
which the now-banned Islamic Salvation Front was set to win.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Compensates Israel 1 Million Dollars for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Israel said Sunday that
Jordanian King Hussein has transferred 1 million U.S. dollars in
compensation for the Naharayim massacre last year, in which seven
Israeli schoolgirls were killed by a Jordanian soldier.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister's Office said that King Hussein had
forwarded a check of 1 million dollars to Israeli President Ezer
Weizman, whom he called a "sincere friend."
</P>
<P>
In a letter, Hussein asked the Israeli president to divide the
compensation to families of the victims, expressing once again
sorrow over the Naharayim incident and saying the compensation was
only a personal gesture aimed to ease as much as possible the
sufferings of the victims' families.
</P>
<P>
Seven Israeli schoolgirls from the central town Beit Shemesh
were killed and six others wounded on March 14 last year by a
Jordanian border guard.
</P>
<P>
The girls were on an organized school outing to Naharayim, a
scenic border area in the Jordan Valley.
</P>
<P>
Hussein won high praise from Israeli public when he paid an
emotional visit to the victims' families in Beit Shemesh late last
March. His highly-publicized visit succeeded in reducing the
damage caused to the warm relations between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Jordan was one of the two Arab countries that signed a peace
treaty with Israel.

<HEADLINE> AL, UN Chiefs Discuss Standoff Between Iraq, UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdel-Meguid exchanged views with U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan on the standoff between Iraq and the U.N. in a
telephone conversation Sunday, Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
During their conversation, the two leaders expressed keenness
to solve the crisis through peaceful means and within the
framework of the Security Council. They agreed to continue their
contacts in this respect.
</P>
<P>
Annan is expected to meet with Abdel-Meguid and Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak when he visits Cairo on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
On the top of his agenda will be the present crisis between
Iraq and the U.N. over weapons inspection. This will be his first
visit to Egypt since he took office as the U.N. chief a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain have threatened to launch air
strike on Iraq to force it to comply with U.N. resolutions and
allow weapons inspectors unimpeded access to its presidential
sites.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid told reporters earlier Sunday that his
organization is to submit a "draft resolution" to the
U.N. Security Council on averting a military option against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the AL chief met Sunday with Russian
Ambassador to Egypt Vladimir Gudev on the latest developments in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid was briefed by Gudev on the outcome of recent
contacts and talks held between Russian presidential envoy Viktor
Posuvalyuk and senior Iraqi officials in Baghdad on the present
crisis between Iraq and the U.N..
</P>
<P>
Gudev expressed conviction that efforts made by the Russian
envoy were a success as the Iraqi side declared its approval to
the Russian proposal that international inspectors have access to
eight presidential sites.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the inspection formula discussed by the
Russian envoy in Baghdad would be an appropriate basis for
reaching a solution acceptable to all parties including the
U.N. and western states.
</P>
<P>
"The Arab and Russian stances are in agreement as regards not
resorting to forces and avoiding a military strike against Iraq,"
he said.

Cabinet Affairs Abdul Aziz Al-Dakhil arrived in Muscat, the
capital of Oman, Sunday afternoon on a tour to coordinate Gulf
states' positions on the Iraqi-U.S. crisis over arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti minister met with senior Omani officials and

</P>
<P>
Oman was the last leg of Al-Dakhil's Gulf tour which has taken
him to Qatar, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia and
Bahrain. He will leave Oman for home Monday.
</P>
<P>
His visit came following U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright's recent Gulf trip aimed at rallying Gulf Arab states'
support for a possible U.S. military strike against Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and Bahrain have promised to back U.S. military strike
if diplomatic efforts failed to solve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia opposed military option while the UAE and
Qatar have not announced their positions.

<HEADLINE> Report: Crime Continues to Rise in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Crime continued to be rampant
last year in Israel, a report released Sunday by the police said.
</P>
<P>
Every 1.4 minute, a crime was committed in Israel last year,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Property infringement occurred every two minutes, a car was
stolen every 11 minutes, a car broken into in every 10 minutes,
and a home robbed of every 15 minutes, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Property damages accounted for 18 percent of all the crimes,
the report added.
</P>
<P>
Crimes, notably violent ones, have been in a rising trend in
Israel since 1994, Police Commissioner Yehuda Wilk said at a news
conference to make public the report.
</P>
<P>
About 46,000 vehicles were stolen last year, registering an
increase of 24 percent, of which 31 percent were retrieved.
</P>
<P>
Wilk said the police would do more this year to check the rise
of car thefts, with special attention on cracking down on shops
selling car parts.
</P>
<P>
The report drew the public attention to the steady rise in
domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
The police received 20,000 complaints of domestic violence last
year, 75 percent of which were involved in violence against women.
</P>
<P>
The report said that a record number of 16 women were killed
last year by their husbands, partners and brothers.
</P>
<P>
Some Israeli politicians and women organizations have called
for tougher laws to check domestic violence.

<HEADLINE> Primakov: Russia-US Ties Do Not Worsen Because of Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Russia's relations with the
United States do not deteriorate because of the two sides'
different positions on the Iraqi crisis, Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The minister's remark was made in the Zerkalo program of the
Russian RTR television company.
</P>
<P>
Primakov, categorically denying the "anti-American
interpretation" of the Russian stance, stated that the Russian
position against settlement of the Iraqi crisis by using force
does not mean that Russia stands against the United States.
</P>
<P>
Russia, at the same time, also supports the elimination of
large-scale destructive weapons in Iraq, Primakov said, and on
this problem Russia shares the view with the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The minister emphasized that good relations with the U.S. are
in keeping with the interests of Russia, which understands the
role and abilities of the U.S. in the modern world, and the U.S.
gradually understands the role of Russia in the world.
</P>
<P>
He stated that Russia does not allow anyone to speak to it in a
commanding tone, and only on an equal basis could the
Russian-American relations be developed steadily.
</P>
<P>
On the Iraqi crisis, Primakov expressed the hope that UN
Secretary-General Kofi Annan will fulfill the Iraq trip. He once
again stressed that a possible strike at Iraq is now unjustified
and may "have negative results to bring us far back."
</P>
<P>
He believed that Russia does not act alone, "almost all Arab
countries oppose the use of force."
</P>
<P>
Primakov meanwhile noted that it still cannot rule out the
possibility of military strike at Iraq. He thought that the "group
of U.N. inspectors should act more efficiently and well-balanced."

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Develops Contraceptive from Caster Bean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian researchers have found
that castor bean can be developed into an effective and cheap
contraceptive, the Guardian newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The research is being carried out by a group of scientists
headed by Barnabas Kabele-Toge, at the College of Medicine,
University of Lagos.
</P>
<P>
Tests on laboratory animals have shown that castor bean has
good contraceptive effect, with little or no side effect, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The researchers have succeeded in formulating the herb into
tablet, capsule and injection forms, but they said further
improvement on them is still needed before starting clinical
trials.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, castor bean was introduced to the
researchers by a native doctor named O. Azija, who claimed that
castor beans as contraceptive are so effective that three seeds
taken orally by a woman can prevent pregnancy for one year.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think any contraceptive is used once a year," said
Kabele-Toge, adding that the research, if successful, will be a
tremendous achievement for Nigeria and will offer it a place in
the global pharmaceutical industry.

</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, a statement from the

According to the statement, there is a deposit of 1,150 tons
of poisonous chemicals stock piled over three decades in 256
stations across the country, including 100 tons of contaminated
containers.

Five percent of the chemicals are among those banned
throughout the world due to the danger they entail.
</P>
<P>
The chemicals include pesticides like DDT, Dieldrin, Aldrin
and Alitelic, the statement said, adding that the disposal of the
chemicals is estimated to demand over 30 million Birr (about 4.34

</P>
<P>
Colonel Ahmed Garaseh Hassan was killed at the airport of
Kismaio, 500 km south of Mogadishu, by angry gunmen who stormed
into the airport in an attempt to block an ICRC relief plane to
land, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
The reason behind the killing of Colonel Hassan, the man in
charge of the only police station in Kismaio, is not known yet.
</P>
<P>
However, sources close to the militiamen in the town said
Colonel Hassan was trying to move the militiamen from the airport
so as to give way to a plane by the International Committee for
the Red Cross with supplies for the flood victims in the region
to land there.
</P>
<P>
The plane by the ICRC was forced to go back to Nairobi after
failing to get a clearance from the airport of Kismaio.
</P>
<P>
The airport itself has been a messy place where clashes
between the armed militiamen in the town occurred every now and
then over khat and fortune seeking squabbles.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoy Urges Kenyan Govt to Stop Tribal Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAKURU, Kenya, February 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. special envoy Jesse
Jackson called Sunday on the Kenyan government to halt tribal
conflicts in which some 120 people have been killed and hundreds
brutally injured since January 11.
</P>
<P>
"The government must bring the order back and stop the
violence," he said after touring three hospitals hosting clash
victims in Nakuru of the Rift Valley Province. The town is an
epicenter of the clashes shocking the whole east African state.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi should exert an influence
immediately on stopping the continuous bloodshed tragedies which
has also scared foreign investors away, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"It's the healing time. (Let) people alive... One Kenya, One
people!" he repeatedly and loudly appealed to the crowd, urging
all Kenyans to choose reconciliation instead of retaliation so as
to fight the poverty and build up the country together.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he noted the country's second multi-party general
election, despite its all flaws and related disturbance, went
through basically in a democratic manner.
</P>
<P>
As U.S. President Bill Clinton's special envoy for the
promotion of democracy in Africa, Jackson is expected to hold
talks with Moi Monday, the second day of his two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Jackson was scheduled to visit the Democratic Republic of
Congo and Liberia afterwards.
</P>
<P>
Local press said Jackson's visits are part of the U.S.
attempts to end violence and improve human rights which the U.S.
administration lists as keys for these nations to attract foreign
investment and get sustainable economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Says UN Evaluation Meetings Constructive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has said the technical
evaluation meetings (TEM) held with the United Nations last week
were "very constructive, very open, very realistic."
</P>
<P>
Presidential Adviser Amer Saadi, who led the Iraqi side during
the TEMs, told a press conference Sunday evening that Iraq has
presented all the material and information regarding the chemical
file.
</P>
<P>
The TEMs, held in Baghdad from February 2 to 6, were
"characterized by professional, scientific and technical
discussions," he said.
</P>
<P>
The technical meetings were designed to evaluate progress made
by Iraq in disarmament and iron out differences between Baghdad
and the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of eliminating
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Saadi said international weapons experts who had participated
in the TEMs would continue their discussions in Bahrain for a week
and hopefully reach a conclusion regarding the chemical agent VX.
</P>
<P>
"We are optimistic, we hope further meetings will be held,"
said Saadi, adding that another meeting will be necessary.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait can not be lifted unless UNSCOM certifies that it is free
of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly declared that it has no banned weapons and
demanded an end to the embargo.
</P>
<P>
Iraq refuses to grant full access to U.N. arms inspectors to
its presidential sites, triggering a crisis between Iraq and the
UNSCOM. The United States has been threatening to take military
action to force Iraq into compliance with relevant
U.N. resolutions.

<P>
JERUSALEM, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Israel has decided to send
Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh and Prime Minister's Foreign Policy
Advisor Uzi Arad to Washington for peace talks with U.S. and
Palestinian officials.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made during Sunday's cabinet meeting which
dealt with the efforts of reviving the stalled Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
When U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright visited Israel
and Palestinian areas earlier this month, the parties concerned
decided to hold the peace talks in Washington.
</P>
<P>
During the trip, Albright noted that the peace talks had
dragged on for a very long time without making any breakthrough.
She said it is time for both Israel and Palestinian leaders to
make "political decisions" on all issues related to the peace
process for the interests of both Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israel's troop redeployment in the West Bank, the time-out of
Israeli settlement activities in the Palestinian territories and
the Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation are the key issues in
the peace process, but no agreements were reached by the two
sides on any of these issues so far.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania will host the
23rd Africa Travel Association (ATA) International Congress in
the northern region of Arusha during May 17-22.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 delegates from the United States, Canada and
African countries are expected to attend the congress, according
to a statement released Sunday by the Principal Secretary in the
Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism, Rose Lugembe.
</P>
<P>
It will cost Tanzania 100 million shillings (about 156,000 US
dollars) to host the congress, Lugembe said, adding that Tanzania
will take the opportunity to display its cultural and tourism
products.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for Tanzania, an ATA member, to host
such a congress, the minister for Natural Resources and Tourism
Zakia Meghji said last week.
</P>
<P>
Other member countries which have hosted ATA international
congresses include Kenya, Cote d'Ivoire, Morocco, Egypt, Gambia,
Zimbabwe, Ghana and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is the largest single earner of foreign exchange in
Tanzania, and a large chunk of the country's tourism revenue
comes from wildlife viewing, Lugembe said.
</P>
<P>
The eastern African country earned 390 million U.S Dollars
from tourism in 1997, up 21.1 percent over the previous year,
according to the ministry statistics.

ADDIS ABABA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of
Agriculture of Ethiopia Sunday warned the public to be wary of
expired pesticides after it discovered part of the 12.5 tons of
the chemicals missing from stores in two regional states.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, a statement from the
ministry said the poisonous chemicals if applied could cause
damages to crops, human beings as well as animals and advised the
society not to use pesticides without consulting the manufacture
and expiry dates and avoid chemicals sold in small quantities
contained in bottles.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, there is a deposit of 1,150 tons
of poisonous chemicals stock piled over three decades in 256
stations across the country, including 100 tons of contaminated
containers.
</P>
<P>
Five percent of the chemicals are among those banned
throughout the world due to the danger they entail.
</P>
<P>
The chemicals include pesticides like DDT, Dieldrin, Aldrin
and Alitelic, the statement said, adding that the disposal of the
chemicals is estimated to demand over 30 million Birr (about 4.34
million U.S Dollars) and fund soliciting campaign has already
begun.

Ethiopia will at the venue call upon the manufacturers to

<HEADLINE> Baikonur to Be Civilian After 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Baikonur space center will
be under full control of the Russian Space Agency by the year of
2000, General Director of the Russian Space Agency Yuri Koptev
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to the ITAR-TASS, Russian President Boris Yeltsin
signed the decree to pass the Baikonur space center which belonged
to the Defense Ministry to the Space Agency in December 1997. The
procedure of the transfer of the Baikonur military facilities is
being drafted.
</P>
<P>
The report said about 16,000 servicemen of the Russian
Strategic Missile Troops are stationed in Baikonur, while about 40
percent of them will be gradually withdrawn to Russia, some 15
percent will stay in Baikonur and the rest will be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
Some 400 million rubles are planned to be allocated from the
1998 budget to solve the housing problem of the dismissed
servicemen. A total of 2,000-2,500 apartments will have to be
annually assigned to the troopers in Russia, the ITAR-TASS said.
</P>
<P>
Thus, Baikonur will become the main commercial and scientific
civilian facility after 2000.
</P>
<P>
Baikonur located in Kazakhstan is the only place in the CIS
from where piloted spacecraft can be launched. The space center
has nine launching pads with 15 launchers capable of sending on a
space mission the heavy boosters. It also has 11 assembly and
testing facilities to assembly spacecraft and satellites.
</P>
<P>
Russia has to annually pay 15 million US dollars to Kazakhstan
in rent for the space center, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Peaceful Solution to Iraqi Crisis Still </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 8 (Xinhua) -- A visiting British peace envoy
said here Sunday that there was still time for the brokering of a
peaceful solution for the current Iraq-U.N. standoff.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that it is possible to reach a solution without the
use of force," said Don Ker, Assistant Foreign Office Secretary of
Britain who arrived here Saturday to explain Britain's policy on
the Iraqi crisis to Jordanian leaders.
</P>
<P>
Following his meetings with Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan and
Prime Minister Abdul-Salam Majali Sunday, the British official
told reporters that Britain would not use force unless all peace
efforts failed.
</P>
<P>
"We are striving together to reach that end (a peaceful
solution) and we still have time," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are waiting for a solution that can comply with the
U.N. Security Council resolutions and this is what matters for
the British government and what I have told the Jordanian side
about," said Ker.
</P>
<P>
The current crisis between Iraq and the United Nations was
triggered by Iraqi denial of U.N. weapons inspectors access to its
presidential sites suspected of hiding banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
Britain is the only country that has announced to join the
U.S. in a possible attack on Iraq to coerce Baghdad into complying
with U.N. resolutions regarding weapons inspection.
</P>
<P>
U.N. weapons inspectors must certify that Iraq is free of
weapons of mass destruction that a seven-year-old U.N. sanctions
imposed on Iraq can be lifted.
</P>
<P>
On the Russian initiative to solve the crisis, Ker said that
"We are grateful for the Russian Foreign Minister's move and we
want these efforts to be crowned with success."
</P>
<P>
He also told reporters that he had met with Arab League Chief
Esmat Abdel-Meguid, who briefed him on the league's efforts to
help avoid use of military force against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Skill Shortages in UK Less Acute: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Skill shortages have eased in
Britain over the past three months, according to the Reed
quarterly skills index released here today.
</P>
<P>
Even so, more than seven in 10 firms are reporting shortages in
suitably skilled job applicants.
</P>
<P>
The index, based on a survey of 686 organizations, shows that
71 percent of the sample is experiencing difficulty in finding
suitable candidates, compared with 76 percent three months ago.
</P>
<P>
Shortages were most acute among service-sector companies, with
74 percent reporting difficulties, compared with 69 percent for
manufacturing firms.
</P>
<P>
James Reed, chief executive of Reed Personnel Services, said
the high pound and consequent tightening of economic conditions
have fed through to recruitment programs nationwide.
</P>
<P>
However, skills shortages, experienced by 71 percent of
organizations, are still running at a higher rate than last year,
when 68 percent were experiencing them, and are particularly high
in the service sector, he added.
</P>
<P>
By sector, catering topped the list, with 86 percent of
recruiters experiencing difficulties, followed by insurance, 83
percent, and accountancy, 73 percent.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that skill shortages have been a big worry
for the Treasury and the Bank of England, because of fears that
they will bring an increase in wage settlements.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet Discusses Iraq Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli cabinet Sunday
discussed the impact on the Jewish state triggered by the crisis
of arms inspections between Iraq and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated that the
possibility of Iraq's missile attacks against Israel is low, and
that the cabinet should help people keep calm.
</P>
<P>
However, he reserved Israel's right of self-defense and said it
would react positively if Iraq attacks Israel.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has barred U.N. arms inspectors from searching
presidential premises for weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The United States has threatened to take military actions to
force Iraq to grant unfettered and unconditional access to the
arms inspections if diplomatic efforts fail to exact Iraq to
comply with the United Nations resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Israel fears that Iraq may respond a possible U.S. attack by
firing missiles to Israel.
</P>
<P>
During the 1991 Gulf War, Iraq fired more than 30 Scud missiles
to Israel's Tel Aviv, causing serious property damage.
</P>
<P>
To get the Israelis prepared and ward off the attack, the
Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) opened seven more gas mask
distribution centers Sunday in major cities to speed up the
distribution of gas masks.
</P>
<P>
IDF officers and soldiers told the Israel Radio that the army
should help the citizens get prepared, including providing them
with new gas masks.
</P>
<P>
The officers and soldiers explained to the citizens how to use
the masks and the methods of protecting themselves in case of
biological weapon attacks.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed
Saeed el-Sahhaf Monday left here for Damascus, starting a tour to
Arab states to rally support for Iraq's efforts to thwart a
possible U.S. attack.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Syria, el-Sahhaf will hold talks with
Syrian officials on the latest development of the crisis over arms
inspections between Iraq and the United Nations Special Commission
(UNSCOM) in charge of eliminating weapons of mass destruction in
Iraq, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He will seek Syria's support for the efforts to ward off any
possible military attack by the United States.
</P>
<P>
The United States, backed by Britain and some Gulf Arab
countries, has threatened to take military actions against Iraq
if diplomatic efforts fail to exact Iraqi compliance with the
UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
Syria is opposed to use force against Iraq, and has called for
resolving the Iraq crisis through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi-Syrian relations have been improving since last May
when a Syrian economic delegation visited Baghdad. This was
followed by the reopening of their joint border and exchanges of
visit by officials of both countries.
</P>
<P>
After Syria, el-Sahhaf will travel to Egypt, Jordan and other
Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Cairo, el-Sahhaf will meet Arab League
chief Ahmed Esmat Abdel-Meguid on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to deliver a message to Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, and hold talks with
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Vice Premier
Li Lanqing here today expressed his satisfaction with the recent
development of Sino-Belgian relations at a meeting with his
Belgian counterpart Philippe Maystadt.
</P>
<P>
Li, who arrived here Sunday leading a delegation of around 50
people, held out hope that the bilateral relations could be
further developed through the joint efforts from both sides.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Maystadt, Belgian vice prime minister and finance minister,
told Li during the talks that Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc
Dehaene was going to visit China this year and that he was also
planning to visit China early next year with a delegation of
Belgian enterpreneurs.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the relationship between the two countries
would be further strengthened and developed through more
high-level visits like this.
</P>
<P>
Li said the bilateral trade relations had been developing
smoothly in recent years, adding that Belgium has achieved success
in its economic and technological cooperation projects in China.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chinese vice premier said their trade cooperation
could be further enhanced, including the cooperation between small
and medium-sized enterprises in both countries.
</P>

The mixed economic and commercial commission of China, Belgium
and Luxembourg held a meeting in Brussels last December, which
Maystadt said during the meeting had promoted the development of
the bilateral trade relations.

The Belgian finance minister said Belgium would actively
discuss with China its investment in the hinderland of China while
expanding its investment in the Chinese coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Belgium's support for China's accession to the
World Trade Organization during the talks. He also expressed his
support for the European Commission's proposal to discontinue
labelling China as a non-market economy in the anti-dumping area.

Asia and briefed his Belgian counterpart on China's current

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- With Saudi Arabia showing deep reluctance to support a
military strike against Iraq, U.S. Secretary of Defense William S.
Cohen said that he would not seek permission to launch American
fighters and bombers from Saudi territory. Secretary of State
Madeleine K. Albright portrayed her recent visit to the Middle East
as a success, but messages from top Arab officials are heavy with
suggestions that the renewed use of force against Iraq could set
off more turmoil in a volatile region.
</P>
<P>
-- The White House broadened its attack on Kenneth W. Starr,
calling him "corrupt" and demanding an independent investigation of
alleged leaks from his office. Officials in Mr. Starr's office
said he had begun his own inquiry into whether his office was
leaking to the press. Meantime, a new witness emerged who, lawers
said, told investigators that Monica S. Lewinsky confided in her
that she had had an extended affair with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- In just over a week, U.S. President Bill Clinton's State of
the Union appeal to "save Social Security first" has redrawn
battle lines in this year's budget debate. Some lawmakers saw the
windfall as a way to fund new federal programs or build more roads
and bridges while others hoped to finance a major tax cut.
</P>
<P>
-- The Clinton administration will announce a plan Monday to
revamp the naturalization process, using Information Age
technology to reduce the chances of granting U.S. citizenship to
criminals and other ineligible applicants.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Childhood poverty has lessened becasue of the strong economy
and expansion of tax credits, the administration says in an
analysis due out this week, but one in five children remains in
poverty. The findings point up the shift in efforts away from
traditional welfare.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Special Envoy Calls for End of Tribal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nairobi, February 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. special envoy Jesse
Jackson urged Monday Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi during
their talks to visit Rift Valley Province in a bid to end tribal
clashes there killing some 120 people since January 11.
</P>
<P>
"The president's presence, personal presence and touch, will
show a humane expression of care across lines, party, ethnic
lines," said Jackson, U.S. President Bill Clinton's envoy for
democracy in Africa, following a morning meeting with Moi.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters following a morning meeting with Moi that he
believes Moi might visit the violent province as early as this
week.
</P>
<P>
He said that a joint visit by Moi and opposition leader Mwai
Kibaki would provide a useful symbol of ethnic and political
unity of the eastern African country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he noted that "the United States is deeply
concerned by the outbreaks of ethnically-based violence in the
Rift Valley in recent weeks."
</P>
<P>
His two-day visit starting Sunday "reflects the importance the
U.S. attaches to the continued development of democracy in
Kenya," Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
Four people were seriously wounded and 17 houses were burned
out when raiders attacked Lorian Saturday night, forcing hundreds
of scared families to flee the area.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Kenya African National Union and the opposition
accuse each other of inciting violence mainly between the largest
Kenyan tribe of Kikuyu and Moi's home tribe Kalenjin.
</P>
<P>
Local press said many of the early victims of the violence
appeared to be Kikuyus, but that Kalenjin people now turned out
to account for half of the dead.
</P>
<P>
Jackson toured three hospitals hosting clash victims in Nakuru
of the Rift Valley Province Sunday. The town is an epicenter of
the clashes shocking the whole east African state.
</P>
<P>
He left here this afternoon for the Democratic Republic of
Congo and Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Local press say his visits are part of preparations for
Clinton's visit to Africa due in March.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Postpones Mideast Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 9 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan has postponed his visit to the Middle East due to the Iraq
crisis, an Israeli government announcement said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Due to the current U.S.-Iraqi confrontations and the
U.S. military buildup in the Gulf, Annan has postponed his planned
Middle East trip, the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief was scheduled to visit Israel and the
Palestinian territory on February 12 during his Middle East trip
to help revive the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
The tense situation in the Gulf and the possible U.S. military
strike against Iraq have caused much concern here, and Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is holding a consultation with
Israeli military leaders Monday afternoon to study the political
and military effects on Israel in the event of the U.S. military
attack on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu reiterated Monday morning that Israel has the right
of self-defense and Israel would retaliate if being attacked by
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In the Palestinian territories, the anti-U.S. sentiment is on
the rise along with the U.S. military buildup in the Gulf. The
Palestinians support the Iraqi people in their struggle against
the U.S. and oppose the use of force against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians held several anti-U.S. demonstrations in
different cities of the West Bank and Gaza Strip during the last
few days and clashed with Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said during his
visit to the Gaza Strip Monday morning that it is dangerous that
the Palestinians side with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Without proper control, such demonstrations and clashes could
only lead to further confrontations between Israelis and
Palestinians, he added.
</P>
<P>
The current crisis in the Gulf was triggered off by Iraq's
refusal to allow U.N. weapons inspectors free access to its

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Witnesses Birth of China's First Transgenic Goat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists announced
today that the first transgenic goat born in the country has
produced milk containing a human gene which provides therapeutic
protein.
</P>
<P>
The milk, which carries the IX Factor, or plasma thromboplastin
component (PTC), offers hope for the treatment of hemophilia,
according to scientists at the Shanghai Research Institute of
Genetics.
</P>
<P>
An additional four goats bred by the institute will soon be
able to produce milk containing the IX Factor, and the institute
expects the birth of even more transgenic goats during the Spring.
</P>
<P>
The birth of China's first transgenic animals bred for medical
purposes is believed to represent a major "breakthrough" in the
nation's genetic engineering research efforts.
</P>
<P>
"The new technology will promote the economic production of a
wide range of proteins derived from the milk of transgenic
animals," according to Professor Tan Jiazhen, a famous Chinese
geneticist.
</P>
<P>
Professor Huang Shuzhen, director of the research program, said
that researchers succeeded in overcoming problems associated with
breeding transgenic animals, including micro injections of foreign
genes and the integration of injected foreign genes with the genes
of recipient animals.
</P>
<P>
The researchers adopted test tube techniques in order to
enhance the integration of genes from a goat with PTC injected
into the embryo of a recipient goat, said Huang.
</P>
<P>
Techniques for embryo transplantation developed by the
researchers are expected to ensure a 70 percent impregnation rate
for recipient goats, a substantial rise on the former 50 success
rate.
</P>
<P>
Transgenic goat research, a national biotechnological project
listed as a major item under China's "863" High-Tech Plan, carried
out with the support of the government, has been conducted for
years by genetic research institutes in Shanghai and at Fudan
University.

HONG KONG, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Stable property prices were
important to the economy of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region government did not want to see a sharp price
increase, nor a collapse in the property market, a high-ranking
official said here Monday.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The '98 National Conference on
Calamities Relief was recently held in Nanning, capital of south
China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The participants agreed that the country has made remarkable
achievements on calamities relief, which has contributed to social
stability and economic development, and ensuring the basic life of
people living in disaster-hit areas.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, in 1997 alone, the central
government allocated 2.2 billion yuan in relief funds and sent 9,000
tents to the areas devastated with floods and earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the local governments spent 1.2 billion yuan for the
purpose, and they received and distributed 40 million quilts and
wears worth over 400 million yuan as well as other donations
valued at more than 600 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The participants of today's conference proposed that China
should further improve its relief work system, by adhering to
the principle of "the central and local governments sharing the
responsibility and the expenditure for the work."
</P>
<P>
Governments of all levels should reinforce their capabilities
in disaster relief and more money should be spent on setting up a
nationwide system for processing, storing and handling the relief
materials.
</P>
<P>
Relief departments should be equipped with better equipment for
telecommunications and communications, while special funds should
be set up for relief efforts.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- China's posts and
telecommunications sector has experienced rapid growth over the
past five years due to reform and the introduction of satellite,
optical fiber cable and computer technology.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of related technology has also contributed to
fulfilling the rising demands for posts and telecommunications
services.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng made the remarks today during a meeting with
senior officials attending a national conference on posts and
telecommunications. Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo and State Councilor
Luo Gan were also present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The premier noted that the sector has developed at an
"extremely rapid" rate. China now has installed 110 million
telephone lines, or some 20 million lines annually, at the same
time introducing optical fiber cable lines linking major cities
throughout the nation, according to Li.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the premier cautioned officials to remain fully
cognizant of the gap between China and developed countries
in the development of the industry.
</P>
<P>
China's demand for posts and telecommunication services offers
vast potential, and the industry should develop in line with
market laws in order to meet the requirements of the people, said
Li.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Scraps Plans to Invest in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Monday regretted
for scrapping plans to invest in Lebanon to help its
reconstruction because of its own economic problems.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Monday night
that he regretted "very much" that Malaysia had to scrap plans to
invest in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that when he visited Lebanon in June last year,
businessmen accompanying him were very keen then to participate in
their own small way in Lebanon's reconstruction following 15 years
of civil war.
</P>
<P>
At a dinner he hosted for visiting Lebanese Prime Minister
Rafic Hariri at his official residence here, Mahathir said, "Our
business people thought that they could take up some of the
projects you offered which would contribute to the rebuilding of
Beirut and other parts of your country."
</P>
<P>
"But today we regret very much that we have to withdraw. The
carpet has been pulled from under our feet. We no longer have the
wherewithal to invest abroad," he told Hariri.
</P>
<P>
There have been sharp falls in Malaysia's economic fortunes
since July last year when the regional currency crisis erupted.
</P>
<P>
"In fact even in our own country our capacity to invest and
develop has been diminished. Suddenly after years of prosperity
created by our own system and efforts we have been made poor,
along with the other countries of Southeast Asia," Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
On Malaysian-Lebanese ties, Mahathir said both countries were
in the process of reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
"You from the ravages of war and we from the ravages caused by
an unprecedented assault on our economy. There is much that we
have in common and therefore there is much that we can do
together. Even weak countries working together can bolster each
other's strength," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that both countries were not exactly the weakest
economies in the world and he was confident that through
friendship and cooperation, the two countries would be able to
recover and develop.
</P>
<P>
Hariri who arrived here Monday morning for a two-day official
visit and Mahathir had a four-eyed discussion lasting about two
hours during the day, which was followed by a full delegation
meeting lasting another hour. The two prime ministers signed a
Memorandum of Understanding on Information Cooperation after the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Hariri also had an audience with Malaysian King Tuanku Ja'afar
before holding talks with Mahathir.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Calls for Holy War Against US Challenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Vice President Taha
Yassin Ramadan Monday called for a holy war against the
U.S. military challenge.
</P>
<P>
He was addressing the opening ceremony of the Eighth Popular
Islamic Conference held here. The three-day conference is attended
by 120 Islamic clerics and Muslims' personalities from 50 Arab and
Islamic states.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan said a holy war could "bare the American-Zionist
(Israeli) regime before peoples of the entire world."
</P>
<P>
The vice president said the United States' attempts to tighten
the embargo on the people of Iraq and its "hysterical threats to
use force against Iraq" revealed its "failure and defeat."
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain have threatened to launch air
attack to coerce Iraq into opening all presidential sites to
U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The seven-year-old U.N. embargo imposed on Iraq following its
1990 invasion of Kuwait cannot be lifted unless the
U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq is free of weapons of mass
construction.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq is strong with its faith and right, powerful with the
brave Muslims who raise their voices loud from all over the globe
in support of Iraq's right and in demand of lifting the embargo,"
said Ramadhan.
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijani delegation was the first to arrive in Baghdad
last week. The delegation groups six clerics and intellects.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to local press upon arrival, the delegation
stressed Muslims' solidarity with, and support for Iraq and its
people, calling for an early lift of the U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General of the Popular Islamic Conference Abdul
Razzaq al-Saadi said that the convening of the conference under
the current circumstances has a special importance as Iraq is
facing threats to dismantle its unity and impair its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Islamic delegations have expressed full
support for Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Iraq refuses to grant full access to U.N. arms inspectors
to presidential sites, triggering a crisis between Iraq and U.N.
Special Commission in charge of disarmament in Iraq.

MANILA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
Monday commended the various groups and individuals for their
efforts in recovering the bodies of the Cebu Pacific plane crash
victims.
</P>
<P>
Ramos also ordered a thorough investigation of the air accident
which resulted in the death of 99 passengers and five crew

</P>
<P>
In a statement, the president particularly thanked all
volunteers, civic-minded people, the mountaineering clubs and
organizations who are still in the mountain jungles to recover the
bodies of the victims.
</P>
<P>
He also thanked the media for giving timely and on-the-spot
accounts of the developments in the search and recovery efforts.
</P>
<P>

Board of the United States and a team of forensic experts from
London, along with the personnel of different government agencies,
"equally deserve our highest appreciation."
</P>
<P>
He also offered his condolences to the families of the victims.
</P>
<P>
He said the crash at Mt. Sumagaya, Claveria, Misamis Oriental,
on February 2 "will go down in history as the worst accident in
the air transportation industry in the Philippines."
</P>
<P>
The president earlier released an initial 5 million pesos
(125,000 U.S. dollars) from the Calamity Fund to support the
search and rescue operations. Additional funds were released by
the National Disaster Coordinating Council.
</P>
<P>
He has also ordered a review of present air routes, safety
features and airport locations in the country to prevent
repetition of such kind of accident.
</P>
<P>
So far, rescuers have found the black box of the ill-fated
plane at the crash site and brought down 65 bags containing body
parts of the victims.

<HEADLINE> France to Seek Diplomatic Solution to Iraqi Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Playing down the German support
for a possible U.S. military strike against Iraq, France vowed
Monday to continue looking for a diplomatic solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Elysee presidential palace said President Jacques Chirac
decided to continue "efforts aimed at a diplomatic solution to the
crisis," after he was briefed by his envoy Bertrand Dufourcq.
</P>
<P>
Dufourcq visited Baghdad and some other Arab capitals last week.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa in
Paris on Monday, French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said his
country will not give up its efforts to find a diplomatic solution.
</P>
<P>
"On the contrary, France will use all its means to try to find
a political and diplomatic way out for the crisis," said Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Moussa said Egypt supports the diplomatic efforts
being made by France, Russia and the Arab League.
</P>
<P>
Iraq should accept the United Nations resolutions on
disarmament, the top Egyptian diplomat said, adding that the world
body should in the meantime respect the sovereignty of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League will present a draft resolution to the U.N.
Security Council calling for prevention of military action against
Iraq and implementation of U.N. resolutions by Iraq, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne
Gazeau-Secret said German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's decision to
support a U.S. military strike against Iraq cannot be considered a
sign of difference between France and Germany over the crisis.
</P>
<P>
France and Germany, Gazeau-Secret said, are not disputing with
each other over whether one should launch a military strike.
</P>
<P>
"The 15 (European Union countries) all agree that the bottom
line of the question is the acceptance by Iraq of the resolutions
of the United Nations," she said.

<HEADLINE> Asian Crisis Making China More Cautious About Its Debts  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Minister of Finance Liu
Jibin said that China will practice even greater prudence in
issuing sovereignty bonds on the global market as a result of the
financial crisis in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Today's People's Daily quoted Liu as saying that
"China has consistently adhered to a prudent policy with regard to
foreign debt and will adopt an even more prudent attitude because
of the financial crisis in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"We will only enter the world capital market under
acceptable market conditions," said Liu, adding that China will
attempt to ensure success by selecting good opportunities for
entering the market.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the Chinese Ministry of Finance introduced to
sovereignty bond issues valued at a total of 800 million US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
China issued Eurobonds valued at 500 million German marks in
June last year, followed by 500 million US dollars in global bonds
in October.
</P>
<P>
China's reform, opening policies and good macroeconomic
environment ensured the success of the two issues, said Liu.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the successful economic soft-landing of the
Chinese economy and the rapid growth in exports in recent years have
enabled China to significantly reduce inflation and maintain a
high economic growth rate.
</P>
<P>
China's year-on-year gross domestic product (GDP) grew 9.7
percent in 1996 and 8.8 percent in 1997. The respective annual
retail sales indexes stood at 6.1 percent and 0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that China's prudent policies have ensured that major
indices tracking the health of the nation's foreign debt level
have remained well within the international safe standards.

<TEXT>
<P>
Official statisitics show that China's debt-service ratio (the
ratio of the annual repayment of principal and interest on debt to
foreign exchange earnings in the same year) stands at 11.8
percent, compared to the generally accepted international standard
of 20 percent. The debt ratio, or the sum of the outstanding value
of a country's foreign debt divided by its gross domestic product,
stands at 14 percent, a level far below the average for developing
nations.
</P>
<P>
China's short-term debt of 118.6 billion US dollars at the end
of June accounted for less than 12 percent of the nation's total
foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
International investors have viewed China differently from
other Asian countries because of its rapidly increasing national
strength, rising international status, good macroeconomic
situation and rigid administration of foreign debt, said Liu.
</P>
<P>
In May last year, Standard &AMP; Poors, a highly reputable US
rating agency, upgraded China's sovereignty debt rating from BBB
to BBB-plus.
</P>
<P>
Liu said the upgrade was a sign indicating the agency's
expanded understanding of China and increasing confidence in the
nation's economic prospects.
</P>
<P>
Liu noted that both Standard &AMP; Poors and US-based Moody's
significantly downgraded the sovereignty debt ratings of the
Republic of Korea, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and various other
Asian nations following the outbreak of the Asian financial
crisis.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Enzhu Gives Spring Reception in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Enzhu, director of the
Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch, said here Monday that he and
his colleagues will work unremittingly for Hong Kong's long-term
stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
He made these remarks at a reception hosted by the Xinhua News
Agency Hong Kong Branch here Monday evening with more than 3,500
people attending.
</P>
<P>
Among them were Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR), high-ranking officials of the
SAR government as well as vice chairmen of the National Committee
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Hong
Kong deputies to China's National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Jiang expressed the belief that Hong Kong
citizens under the leadership of the SAR government headed by Tung
Chee Hwa will tide over the temporary economic difficulties and
make glorious achievements.
</P>
<P>
He said that since Hong Kong's return to the motherland, the
principles of "one country, two systems" and "Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong" with a high degree of autonomy have been
implemented in real earnest and everything has been operating in a
normal manner.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, efforts will be made to implement the principles of
"one country, two systems" and the Basic Law in an all-round way
and maintain Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Although Hong Kong is faced with some difficulties under the
impact of the Asian financial turmoil, Jiang said, Hong Kong's
economic foundation is stable and its financial system is healthy.
</P>
<P>
Backed by the motherland, he said, Hong Kong citizens who are
enterprising and good at meeting challenges, can certainly tide
over the temporary difficulties and make more glorious
achievements under the leadership of the SAR government headed by
Tung Chee Hwa.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch, a
working institution authorized by the central authorities, will as
always promote the close cooperation between Hong Kong and inland
areas, and respect and support the SAR government in performing
its duties in accordance with the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
It will continue to maintain wide and close ties with Hong Kong
people in all walks of life and make unremitting efforts to
implement the principles of "one country, two systems" and "Hong
Kong people governing Hong Kong" with a high degree of autonomy in
an all-round way and to safeguard Hong Kong's long-term stability
and prosperity, he added.
</P>
<P>
In his address, Tung Chee Hwa said that Hong Kong's economy has
entered a period of readjustment. The financial turmoil in Asia
has brought a lot of pains to Hong Kong and at the same time
accelerated the necessary readjustment of Hong Kong's economic
structure.
</P>
<P>
He said he is fully confident that Hong Kong will extricate
itself from the difficulties as soon as possible when the Asian
financial turmoil calms down.
</P>
<P>
Tung also said that the SAR government will share weal and woe
with Hong Kong citizens, consolidate Hong Kong's economic
foundation, make good use of resources and work for the well-being
of Hong Kong citizens.

<HEADLINE> Manila for Use of Local Currencies in Trade Payments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines is backing up a proposal by the neighboring ASEAN
countries to use their respective currencies as payments for
intra-trade settlements, the Philippine News Agency said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The plan came about after Philippine President Ramos and
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir discussed over the weekend the
possibility of adopting the use of local ASEAN currencies to
enhance trade and economic cooperation between the member
countries, it said.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson said the
proposed scheme involves payment of exports in the currency of the
exporting country trading within the region. Individual trade
contracts among participating countries are to be transacted in
local currency.
</P>
<P>
This, however, will be quoted in terms of the daily prevailing
exchange rate of that currency with respect to the U.S. dollar, he
said, adding that the settlement of transactions will be
undertaken through the respective commercial banks of
participating members.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed scheme, only the trade balance shall be
settled in U.S. dollars at a fixed interval, which may be a month
or a quarter, Singson said.
</P>
<P>
According to Singson, this scheme will reduce the ASEAN member
countries' heavy dependence on U.S. dollars for trade payments and
other transactions and will promote greater trade among
participating members in the ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
He is confident that the proposed scheme is expected to be
favorable to the interest of the Philippines because the demand
for U.S. dollars will be pushed back to the settlement date.
</P>
<P>
Details of this scheme will be discussed further when central
bank governors of the ASEAN countries meet in Bali, Indonesia, on
February 12 to fine-tune the operational efficiency and other
mechanics of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) groups the
Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, Singapore, Vietnam,
Thailand, Myanmar and Laos.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the regular ASEAN members, non-ASEAN members
such as South Korea, Nepal and Sri Lanka are also expected to
attend the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Fertilizer Prices Go Up in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's fertiliser
manufacturers today announced an average 27 percent increase in
the selling prices of fertilisers with further small increases
scheduled for later in the year.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, a spokesman for the Zimbabwean Fertiliser
Company and Windmill said that the companies had reluctantly decided
to initiate an increase brought about by massive input costs
increase experienced by manufacturers in the past 18 months.
</P>
<P>
With imported raw materials making up more than 50 percent of
total raw materials, this has had a major impact on
production costs, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
''We have also experience substantial increases in the costs
of all local inputs, including coal, power, fuel, wages and
salaries and railage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
In order to minimise the price increases required to maintain
viability in the industry, fertiliser companies were forced
to implement measures that will improve operational efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, however, maintained that
despite the increase, fertiliser was still relatively cheaper in
U.S.Dollar terms than in the past.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean Dollar, facing its worst crisis since
independence in 1980, depreciated by more than 70 percent in the
past year forcing the prices of most goods and services with
foreign inputs going up sharply.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Hackl Wins third Olympic Gold in Nagano </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Georg Hackl of Germany
created a history for the sport of luge when he won his third
consecutive Olympic men's single title here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile on snow, Bulgarian biathlete Ekaterina Dafovska gave all
a surprise except herself with victory in the women's 15km individual
event at the 18th Olympic Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
Hackl, gold medalist in Albertville and Lillehammer, had a combined
time of three minutes 18.436 seconds, beating his Italian rival Armin
Zoeggeler by half a second.
</P>
<P>
Jens Mueller of Germany took the bronze in 3:19.093.
</P>
<P>
Markus Prock of Austria, who finished second in both Albertville
and Lillehammer, was squeezed out of the podium and came in fourth at
3:19.656.
</P>
<P>
With the victory, Hackl joined other five athletes to win three
consecutive Winter Olympic golds in the same events.
</P>
<P>
The others are figure skaters Gillis Grafstrom of Sweden, Norway's
Sonja Henie and Irina Rodnina of former Soviet Union, Nordic combined
skier Ulrich Wehling of the former East Germany and American speed
skater Bonnie Blair.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old Bavarian, three times world champion and double
World Cup winner, led all the way throughout Monday's two runs, and
created a speed record of 130.3kmh.
</P>
<P>
Amid heavy snow at the Japanese Alps, Dafovska, 22, captured the
gold medal of the women's biathlon 15km individual with a finishing
time of 54:52.0.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian, entering the event as an underdog, defeated many top
names in the competition for the gold.
</P>
<P>
Dafovska, making her second Olympic appearance after Lillehammer,
was ranked 51st in last year's World Cup standings.
</P>
<P>
Despite unsuccessful start of the season, her accurate shooting and
incredibly fast skiing put her in the first place.
</P>
<P>
"This track is very fast," she said. "That is why the skiing was
so important here."
</P>
<P>
Dafovska missed only one shot in four shootings, two in prone and
two in standing positions.
</P>
<P>
The silver medal went to Ukrainian biathlete Elena Petrova, who
crossed the finish line 17.8 seconds after Dafovska in 55:09.8.
</P>
<P>
Experienced Olympic athlete Ursula Disl of Germany repeated her
performance in Lillehammer, taking the bronze medal in the event at
55:17.9.
</P>
<P>
Mika Myllylae of Italy won the day's first medal event, taking the
men's cross country 30km classical race in one hour 33 minutes and
55.8 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Myllyliae, 28, gained his fame after winning the grueling 50km at
the 1997 World Championships in Trondheim, Norway in spite of the
heavy snow.
</P>
<P>
Erling Jevne of Norway was second and Silvio Fauner of Italy came
third.
</P>
<P>
World number one Thomas Algaard of Norway pulled out of the race
midway through the race. He was 50th at the time.
</P>
<P>
In another surprising development, hs countryman Bjorn Daelie,
ranked second in the world and dominant figure in men's cross country
throughout the 1990s, finished in 20th place.
</P>
<P>
In the first run of speed skating on Monday, world record holder
Hiroyasu Shimizu of Japan led a group of 42 skaters for Tuesday's
second race of the men's 500m race.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese covered the distance in 35.76 seconds, 0.37 seconds
off his own world record set in Calgary, Canada in March, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Pre-race favourites Jeremy Wotherspoon of Canada and Jan Bos of the
Netherlands both had problems on rink.
</P>
<P>
Bos almost stook up at the start, and fell to 20th place in 36.66
seconds. He kicked the ice in frustration afterward, knowing that his
chances for medal have virtually evaporated.
</P>
<P>
Wotherspoon will need the race of his life tomorrow in the second
heat to overcome a slip on the second curve in which he touched the
ice for balance. He ended up in seventh at 36.04.
</P>
<P>
The day's competitions were marred by cancellation or postponement
of some events due to heavy snowfall. The women's snowboarding giant
slalom and the men's Alpine skiing combined slalom, which were
originally set for Monday morning, were put back to Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In the first day competition of the Olympics on Sunday, the men's
downhill was cancelled and re-scheduled for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the ice hockey tournament on Monday, Belarus defeated Germany
8-2 and France beat Japan 5-2 in the men's Group B preliminary round.
While in the women's section, Finland outplayed Japan 11-1, United
States overpowered Sweden 7-1 and Canada whitewashed China 2-0.
</P>
<P>
After three-day competitions, Belarus led the Group B standings
with four points from two wins. Germany was second at 2 with one win
and one loss.
</P>
<P>
Finland, United States and Canada, each collected two wins, led the

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Ready to Cut Off Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 9 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is ready to
trim its defense force and the cabinet has approved a set of
criteria for forced retrenchments, the South African National
Defense Force (SANDF) said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The SANDF said an individual's disciplinary record, past work
performance and level of expertise would be taken into account.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the defense review approved last year, the
rationalized SANDF should have about 70,000 members. Its current
staff component stands at 94,000.
</P>
<P>
The rationalization is expected to start by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
The SANDF said the process would be spread over a number of
years. It would involve natural attrition, transfers to other
departments, not renewing short-term contracts, voluntary
severance packages, and forced retrenchment.
</P>
<P>
Staff whose posts had been abolished would not necessarily be
laid off, and not all those in posts retained would escape
retrenchment.
</P>
<P>
"All serving members, irrespective of their posts, employment
and service conditions will be considered for rationalization,"
SANDF sources said.
</P>
<P>
Those retrenched would receive newly negotiated packages, of
which details were still to be announced.
</P>
<P>
The SANDF said its rationalization program provided for a
transition support center in Pretoria, the capital of South
Africa, to help staff facing retrenchment.
</P>
<P>
In addition, regional centers would also be set up. They would
offer retrenched members training opportunities and help them to
find employment in civil society.

<HEADLINE> S'pore to Start Multi Billion Dollar Petrochemical </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Singapore will undertake a
multi-billion-dollar petrochemical project in the western part of
the island country despite the ongoing financial crisis that had
swept Southeast Asia, a senior government official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
EDB Chairman Philip Yeo said that the Economic Development
Board (EDB) and the Mobil Corporation are expected to conclude
talks on the project and make an announcement by the end of March
this year.
</P>
<P>
Mobil's feasibility study for the project envisages an 800
million U.S. dollars naphtha cracker, with an annual capacity of
800,000 tons of ethylene and 440,000 tons of propylene.
</P>
<P>
Yeo said that the next phase of a
seven-billion-Singapore-dollar (4.19 billion U.S. dollars at
current exchange rate) land reclamation project for Jurong Island
in the western part of the country, which is going to be the site
of the Mobil's proposed cracker as well as other petrochemical
plants and refineries, will begin in August.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Television reported Monday evening that the EDB might
take more than 30 percent stake of the major petrochemical plant
planned by Mobil Corporation.
</P>
<P>
It quoted an EDB spokeswoman as saying that normally the EDB
does not take more than 30 percent stake in projects. However, "as
a result of the economic crisis, we are looking at investing more
than 30 percent on a case-by-case basis," she said.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Government Reiterates Commitment to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- A Zambian senior official here
Monday reiterated the government's commitment to reducing poverty
among the people from the current levels of 70 percent to 50
percent by the year 2004, according to Zambia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a consultative workshop on poverty reduction this
morning in the capital, Samuel Miyanda, the Minister for
Community Development and Social Services, said that there is no
reason why a country like Zambia so endowed with natural
resources should continue to be among the poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
Zambia, with a population of about 10 million, is rich in
minerals and arable land, and water resources which account for
40 percent in southern Africa. However, it is defined by
the United Nations as one of the 43 poorest countries in the
world.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Miyanda stressed that poverty reduction can be
attained in Zambia provided all citizens identify themselves with
the problem and work hard to reverse the ugly situation and share
the wealth that has been created.
</P>
<P>
He identified the major stumbling block in the eradication of
poverty as starvation, inadequate social infrastructure,
inadequate clean water, poor housing and limited access to
education and health.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government, in its 1998 budget publicized on 30
January, decided to adopt a quantitative target for reducing poverty
over the medium-term, namely to reduce the proportion of 70
percent of the population living in poverty to 50 percent by the

<HEADLINE> Healthy Sino-ROK Ties Offer Multiple Benefits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Hu Jintao, standing committee
member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) Central Committee, said today that healthy and stable ties
between China and the Republic of Korea (ROK) will benefit peace,
stability and development on the Korean Peninsula, and in the Asia
Pacific Region as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that further strengthening of friendly exchanges and
cooperation between China and the ROK in advance of the 21st
century will be in the fundamental interests of the people in both
countries.
</P>
<P>
Hu, also a member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central
Committee, made the remarks during a meeting with Kim Jong-pil,
honorary president of the ROK's Liberal Democratic Union (LDU).
</P>
<P>
Hu noted that Sino-ROK relations have developed steadily and
all spheres of bilateral cooperation have been expanded since the
two nations established diplomatic relations earlier this decade.
</P>
<P>
Friendly contacts between the LDU and CPC have been established
as a result of the current visit of Kim Jong-pil, noted Hu.
</P>
<P>
The CPC is fully prepared to develop new party-to-party
relations with LDU and other political parties in the ROK in line
with the principles of independence, self-reliance, equality,
mutual respect and mutual noninterference, said Hu, adding that
related actions will help promote relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Kim Jong-pil said the LDU attaches great importance to its
relations with China, and expressed the hope that the two nations
will expand exchanges and cooperation in order to further develop
bilateral relations geared to the new century.
</P>
<P>
Kim noted that the ROK will strictly abide by agreements
reached with China when the two countries established diplomatic
relations, and will strictly adhere to its one-China position by
refraining from establishing official relations with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The ROK delegation, which arrived on February 8, is visiting
China at the invitation of the CPC. Dai Bingguo, head of the CPC
Central Committee's International Department, held working talks
with Kim and his party shortly after their arrival.

<HEADLINE> African States Urged to Use Science for Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) on Monday called on experts
to help bring science and technology to bear on the food
security and sustainable development in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by Lalla Ben Barka, ECA Deputy Executive
Secretary, on behalf of Executive Secretary K.Y. Amoako, at the
opening ceremony of a four-day meeting of the ad-hoc group
of experts on science and technology for food security and
sustainable development in the Ethiopian capital.
</P>
<P>
Barka said, "Africa is the only continent where per capita
food production has been stagnating or declining in the last
three decades."
</P>
<P>
This poor trend has been further compounded by a population
growth rate that exceeds food production. The food problem and
the population pressure have led to an alarming rate of
environmental degradation, the ECA official warned.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that the ECA will focus its science and
technology activities on issues relating to food security
achievement through agricultural, demographic and environmental
transitions.
</P>
<P>
Barka added that it is important for ECA to be guided by
experts to ensure that science and technology play this
catalytic role.
</P>
<P>
She said that during the biennium 1998-1999, ECA
intends to concentrate its science and technology on food
security achievement through three transitions: the transition
from low to high performing agriculture, from high to low
population growth rate and from environmental degradation to
environmental conservation.
</P>
<P>
Participants were urged to rise up to the great challenge and
help ECA to make a contribution to the extrication of African
continent from poverty, diseases and malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
During the four-day meeting, experts will present their
countries' reports on science and technology on food security and
sustainable development. They will also launch the ECA's science
and technology network for Africa.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- China is now offering day and
night boat services along the upper reaches of the Mekong River,
increasing trade considerably with nearby countries.
</P>
<P>
The 4,880-km-long river runs through China, Myanmar, Laos,
Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam. The 2,130-km section upstream in
China is known as the Lancang River.
</P>
<P>
A fleet of freighters belonging to the China Southwest Water
Transport Development Group operates on 361 km on the upper
reaches, between Burma, Laos, and Thailand, but there are more
than 100 rapids, and night travel was not possible in the past.
</P>
<P>
But, the group had decided to provide 24-hour service as trade
with Southeast Asian countries has been increasing rapidly. It has
put more than 100 navigation markers on the river, and is
equipping its ships with advanced navigation equipment.
</P>
<P>
It now takes 20 hours to go from Guanlei in Yunnan Province to
Thailand, half a day less than it took before. As a result, more
than 30 ships are in the harbor daily, moving metals, machinery,
and daily necessities from China, and seafood, minerals, and
timber from countries along the lower reaches of the river.

<HEADLINE> Australia Tries to Avert Military Response to Iraqi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government
Monday stepped up diplomatic attempts to avert a military response
to the Iraq standoff amid fears Australia could become a target
for an Iraqi chemical or biological weapons strike.
</P>
<P>
After talking to Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien and New
Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley Monday, Prime Minister John
Howard told reporters Monday that he still believed a diplomatic
solution was possible, saying "We are, as Australia, intensifying
our diplomatic activity."
</P>
<P>
"I still remain of the view that if this matter can be settled
by diplomatic processes, that is clearly the best way. Nobody
wants force used," he said.
</P>
<P>
The federal cabinet would decide Tuesday if Australia will join
any military action.
</P>
<P>
Opposition leader Kim Beazley said he doubted Australia would
be more vulnerable to chemical attack if it joined military action
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe that would be a consequence," Beazley said.
</P>
<P>
"The nature and character of any assistance that we would
present would be essentially symbolic in nature," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Federation of Islamic Councils pleaded with
Howard to keep Australia out of the conflict, warning it could
spread to the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The organization's president Wasser Nasser has written to
Howard, saying Iraq's neighbors did not want military action.
</P>
<P>
"They fear that the consequences in the region will be
incalculable and in today's world, such evil effects would quickly
spread to other regions, including our own," he said.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Reforming Its Grain Distribution System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- China's Tibet Autonomous Region
has worked out some rulings on reforming its grain distribution
system to increase its self-sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
It implemented a balanced grain supply system three years ago,
and the local government has been increasing input in agriculture
and trying to expand the number of grain-growing areas.
</P>
<P>
Under that system, the chairman of the autonomous regional
government is held responsible for grain supplies in the region
and officials in each city and county manage grain production,
purchases, allocations, and sales.
</P>
<P>
There is a temporary subsidy for fixed quota grain purchases,
and urban and rural residents with low incomes pay relatively
lower prices in buying grain and edible oil.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous region arranged some 17 million yuan (2.05
million US dollars) on agriculture last year and its total grain
output was estimated at 820,000 tons.

<HEADLINE> AL: Peaceful Solution to UN-Iraq Crisis Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdel-Meguid Monday stressed possibility of reaching a
solution for the current U.N.-Iraq standoff through the
U.N. Security Council (SC).
</P>
<P>
"There is still a possibility to solve the crisis within the
U.N. Security Council," Abdel-Meguid told a press conference held
here following his meeting with Arab delegates at the league
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's refusal to open its presidential sites suspected of
hiding lethal arms to the U.N. Special Commission on scrapping its
biological and chemical weapons has sparked a stand-off with the
U.N. and prompted a call for military strikes by the U.S..
</P>
<P>
"The military option will only complicated the already
sensitive situation while a political solution can help solve
crisis and maintain stability of the region... It is difficult but
not impossible," the AL leader told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid pointed out that the Arab side seeks Iraq's
implementation of the SC resolutions which it accepted and abided
by and at the same time supports a full ban on weapons of mass
destruction in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League contacts with various parties on easing the
tension will continue to avoid serious crisis threatening the
region, he added.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohamed Saeed Al Sahhaf, who is visiting
Syria, is due to arrive in Cairo soon. "He might carry proposals
and ideas that could help defuse the Iraqi crisis," Abdel-Meguid
said in an interview granted to Saudi newspaper Okaz of Monday.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting with the permanent delegates Monday morning,
the AL chief briefed them on the outcome of contacts and
consultations he conducted with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and
other officials in a bid to find out a balanced solution that
would contribute to staving off a military strike against Baghdad
and ensuring Iraq's commitments to implement the U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid told reporters earlier Sunday that his
organization is to submit a "draft resolution" to the Security
Council on averting a military option against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain have threatened to launch air strike on
Iraq to force it to comply with U.N. resolutions and allow weapons
inspectors unimpeded access to its presidential sites.

<HEADLINE> SKorea's Consumer Goods Import Down in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 9 (Xinhua) -- South Korea imported 698 million
U.S. dollars worth of consumer goods last month, plunging 48.3
percent from January 1997, the Customs Administration said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The figure accounted for nine percent of the country's total
monthly imports, down 11 percent from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Due to the current financial crisis triggered by a series of
corporate failures and bad loans of financial institutions in late
1997, the nation's imports plummeted last month.
</P>
<P>
In the first month of the year, the import of golfing goods
marked zero while automobiles registered 2 million dollars, a deep
cut from the 44 million dollars in January 1997.
</P>
<P>
Garment import fell 65.8 percent to 40 million dollars, liquor
and cigarettes dropped 64.9 percent to 20 million dollars, and
home electronics from 112 million dollars to 53 million.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, beef and pork imports downed 67.9 and 84.6 percent
respectively, and maritime and agricultural products nosedived
57.1 and 37.8 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said South Korea will continue to slash its imports in
rest of the year while increasing its exports to overcome the
financial crisis.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 9 (Xinhua) -- South African investment
in Uganda has increased sharply from about 18 million U.S.
Dollars to 160 million Dollars in the past two years, the
Business Day newspaper said Monday.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is now among the biggest foreign investors in
Uganda, the paper quoted Uganda Investment Authority, which
handles the granting of investment licences, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Britain is still the number one investor in the country.
</P>
<P>
The authority said South African investment was boosted last
year by the signing of a double taxation treaty, following a visit by
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni to Pretoria and a South African
trade mission to Kampala.
</P>
<P>
The biggest new South African investors in Uganda are South
African Breweries, which bought a 40 percent stake worth 30
million Dollars in a Ugandan brewer, and a MTN-led consortium
which will provide a second telecommunications network.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the two countries has also been growing rapidly.
Exports to Uganda from the Southern African Customs Union (SACU)
more than doubled to 19 million Dollars in the first half of last
year against the same period in 1996. About 70 percent of the
SACU's trade was generated by South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Show Strength at Australian Constitutional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- After one-week debates,
Australia's Constitutional Convention Monday declared two
resolutions which to show the strength of republicans and indicate
monarchists have little chance of winning key votes on the
convention floor.
</P>
<P>
The Constitutional Convention cleared the way for Australia to
become a republic by the centenary of federation on January 1,
2001, with a president to replace the governor general as head of
state.
</P>
<P>
A second convention resolution also left open the way for the
republic to come into force in time for the opening of the 2000
Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
However, the republicans still remain divided late Monday
night on how to select the president.
</P>
<P>
Proponents of a popular election of a president earlier Monday
put forward a compromise plan designed to appeal to the Australian
Republican Movement (ARM) insistence that the head of state be
appointed by a two-thirds majority of both houses of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the public and politicians would be able to
nominate candidates for the presidency, with a list of at least
three to be decided by a two-thirds majority of parliament.
</P>
<P>
In another concession to the ARM, the plan would see the
reserve powers of the head of state partially defined.
</P>
<P>
But the plan caused immediate divisions, with popular election
advocate Phil Cleary declaring he would not support it.
</P>
<P>
The Direct Presidential Election Group Monday night put the
proposal to a meeting with ARM chairman Malcolm Turnbull. The
meeting was described as friendly and cooperative, but broke up
without agreement.
</P>
<P>
In another worrying sign for republicans, Queensland direct
election advocate Clem Jones put up a proposal to defer a
referendum on the republic if the convention outcome does not
support popular election.
</P>
<P>
While Jones's proposal was defeated on the convention floor, it
did show 21 republicans were willing to risk a referendum in the
push for a popular election.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Australian Republican Movement Malcolm Turnbull
expected republicans to reach an agreed position Wednesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's overall export
earnings during the first half of the current 1997-98 fiscal year

year.
</P>
<P>
In the period, the earnings from ready-made garments export,
the biggest foreign exchange earner of the country, stood at 1.460
billion dollars, 16.85 percent higher than the target of 1.25
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The country earned 31.11 million dollars from tea export, up by
27.49 percent while the earnings from frozen food export increased
by 27.49 percent against the target.

However, the EPB pointed out that the earnings from frozen
food, leather, jute goods and other traditional items came down.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's total export earnings have been targeted at 5
billion dollars during the current fiscal year (July 1997-June
1998), the EPB said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong launched a survey
of some 60,000 private buildings Monday to boost public awareness
of fire safety.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launch of the survey, Director of Fire Services
Peter Cheung said the importance of fire safety cannot be
over-emphasized, as is illustrated by the serious fires recently.
</P>
<P>
The fire service installations and their maintenance will also
have to be brought up to scratch, coupled with good management, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
About 180 voluntary officers of the Fire Services Department
will inspect the buildings over the next two months.
</P>
<P>
The information collected will form the basis of a data bank
from which further strategies by the department's Fire Protection
Command will be mapped out.
</P>
<P>
The inspectors will look at fire service installations and
their state of maintenance, the presence of illegal roof-top
structures, electrical installations and wiring along means of
escape and obstruction to means of escape.
</P>
<P>
Serious cases of offenses spotted by the inspectors will be
reported to the department for immediate follow-up action.
</P>
<P>
A few fires have been reported lately, of which a blaze at a
building in Kowloon killed four people last week.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Urges Sierra Leone Junta to Co-operate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) has urged the Sierra Leonean military
junta to co-operate with it so that a humanitarian corridor will
be opened in the country, said reports reaching here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ECOWAS Committee of Five on Sierra Leone, comprising the
foreign ministers of Nigeria, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea and
Liberia, made the appeal at the weekend in New York.
</P>
<P>
The committee, accompanied by ECOWAS Executive Secretary and a
representative of the Organization of African Unity, had earlier
briefed the United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the
Security Council on the situation in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The ECOWAS committee welcomed the initiative to establish a
contact group on Sierra Leone and expressed appreciation to Annan
for agreeing to co-chair with ECOWAS the launching of the group.
</P>
<P>
The committee said some countries have pledged to contribute
to a trust fund for Sierra Leone and called on other countries to
do so when the fund is established.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, heavy fightings continued on the outskirts of the
Sierra Leonean capital Freetown on Sunday, with the military
junta and the ECOWAS peace-keeping force ECOMOG accusing each
other of launching the offensive.
</P>
<P>
The fighting, which broke out last Thursday, has killed three
soldiers and seven civilians on the Sierra Leone side and wounded
38 others, the junta said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports indicate the ECOMOG is now trying to cut
off the main roads into Freetown.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 9 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela has criticized the United States's policy on Iraq,
demanding the White House stop regarding itself as the world's
policeman.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a television interview on Sunday night, Mandela
said it was wrong to have so many U.S. representatives in the
United Nations team searching for weapons of mass destruction in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The United States should also not interfere in matters of
regional conflict, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela reiterated that South Africa's position was that it
would not interfere in the Gulf crisis as this was a matter to be
resolved by Arab states in the region.
</P>
<P>
The latest gulf crisis was triggered by Iraq's refusal to
grant access to so-called presidential sites to inspectors from
the UN Special Commission on Disarmament.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain have assembled a formidable
military force in the gulf region and have threatened to give
Iraq another military strike unless Iraqi leaders allowed the UN
officials unfettered access to suspected weapons sites.

<HEADLINE> Shimizu Threatens to Win Men's 500m Speed Skating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 9 (Xinhua) -- World record holder Hiroyasu
Shimizu threatened to take the men's 500 meters speed skating event
tomorrow after he led the first run race on Monday at the Nagano
Winter Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Shimizu, who set the world record 35.39 seconds in Calgary, Canada,
on March 2 in 1996, completed the distance in 35.76 seconds, breaking
the old Games record of 36.33 seconds, and 0.2 seconds ahead of
Canadian Kevin Oveland.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old Japanese looked easy several meters before he
crossed the finish line. He skated on outer lane against Patrick
Bouchard of Canada in the race of the 19th of 21 pairs and clocked the
fastest time in the first 100 meters in 9.66 seconds, compared with
Oveland's 9.99.
</P>
<P>
"My 100-meter lap time was good but I was a bit nervous becuase it
was my first race," said the Japnese medal hopeful.
</P>
<P>
"Tomorrow, I'm sure I can mark a better time if I make a better
start and skate smoothly throughout. But, in the Olympics, it is a
matter of win or lose and not time."
</P>
<P>
Casey Fitzrandolph of the United States came in a surprise third
with a time of 35.81 seconds. But his 100-meter lap time of 9.77
seconds was second in all 32 skaters.
</P>
<P>
"I'm shocked. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't," said Fitzrandolph,
whose best time in 500 meter before was 35.90 seconds. "This was what
I was looking to do, but not what i was expecting."
</P>
<P>
Pre-race favorites Jeremy Wotherspoon of Canada and Jan Bos of the
Netherlands were paired but both had problems.
</P>
<P>
Bos almost stood up at the start, and fell to 20th place in 36.66
seconds. He kicked the ice in frustration afterward, knowing that his
chances for a medal have virtually evaporated. He walked past
reporters without comment after race.
</P>
<P>
Wothespoon will need the race of his life tomorrow in the second
heat to overcome a slip on the second curve in which he touched the
ice for balance. He ended up in seventh place in 36.04.

<HEADLINE> Plan for Direct Presidential Election in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Australian proponents of a
popular election for president in a republic Monday put forward a
refined plan to allow federal parliament to endorse a list of
candidates.
</P>
<P>
As the Constitutional Convention entered into its second week,
a new proposal from the Direct Presidential Election Group is
designed as a compromise to the Australian Republican Movement
which wants the head of state appointed by a two-thirds majority
of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Under the new plan, the public and politicians will be able to
nominate candidates for the presidency. A two-thirds majority of
both houses of parliament would then choose a list of at least
three candidates, who would face election at a federal election.
</P>
<P>
The head of state would remain in office for two terms, but
could be dismissed by a majority of the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
"Our view is that it is a reasonable compromise, to say the
parliament of Australia can do the selecting," West Australian
Opposition leader Geoff Gallop told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"We're quite confident the Australian parliament would do that
job well, and come up with good candidates who could then submit
themselves to the people," he added.
</P>
<P>
Gallop said the direct election group had widespread support,
but he refused to comment on numbers.
</P>
<P>
Another issue under heated debate among the 152 delegates last
week was when would Australia become a republic.
</P>
<P>
Many of the republicans wanted a referendum next year and for
Australia to become a republic on January 1, 2000, to capture the
national spirit leading up to the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"It is quite incongruous, bizarre almost, to contemplate us
going to the games with the Queen reading the opening speech,"
they said.
</P>
<P>
Convention chairman Ian Sinclair Monday reminded that while
many wanted to see a republic either in time for the Sydney 2000
Olympics or on the centenary of federation on January 1, 2001,
there were many consequential constitutional changes that needed
to be considered first.
</P>
<P>
"If we do decide to change, it is not just a matter of a stroke
of a pen on a bit of paper. There are a lot of other fundamentals
that need to be identified but it will take time to achieve
those," Sinclair said.
</P>
<P>
Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy (ACM) executive
director Kerry Jones said she favored a referendum next year to
test the current system against whatever republican model was put
up and believed the monarchists would win.
</P>
<P>
But Jones said the ACM would not enter the debate on the timing
of a republic.

<HEADLINE> Three Million Farmers in Gansu Corridor Being Helped Out Of Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Three million farmers in
northwest China's Gansu corridor were given help in getting away
from poverty by the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The corridor is Gansu Province's largest grain, cotton, and oil
producer, with 1.8 billion kg of grain every year, making the
province self-sufficient in grain supply.
</P>
<P>
With annual per-capita income of at least 2,300 yuan, the
farmers of the Zhangye and Jiuquan agricultural zones have a
relatively good life, and the Chinese government made the corridor
a state agriculture development zone, spending 760 million yuan
(91.6 million US dollars) from 1983 to 1993 on 53 water
conservation projects, adding 70,000 hectares of irrigated land,
and completing irrigation systems in Shiyang, Heihe, and Shule
rivers.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, science and technology have contributed much to
agriculture improvements. In Zhangye, on 40,000 hectares of land,
water saving irrigation was used.
</P>
<P>
Increased amounts of agricultural by-products helped township
enterprise development, and there were 60,000 township enterprises
in five cities, with an annual output worth 15 billion yuan (1.8
billion US dollars), and 80 percent of the farmers families have
moved into new houses with tap water, 95 percent of the villages
are connected by improved roads, and 77 percent of the villages
have access to telephones.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading French Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers Monday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- After British Prime Minister Tony Blair, German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl has expressed support to the American strategy in Iraq,
showing his difference in a spectacular manner with France and other
European Union members, which prefer a diplomatic solution to the
crisis. Germany will not necessarily go so far as sending troops to
the Gulf, but will provide its military bases to American troops,
and its support is enough to satisfy the United States Defense
Secretary William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
-- The four Frenchmen abducted last Tuesday in the south of Chad
by a rebel movement were released on Sunday. But the circumstances
around their release, which followed a meeting between rebel leader
Dr. Mahamud Nahor and French officials, remains a secret. Some
villagers said that the Frenchmen were released by Chadian
government soldiers and not by rebels.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin will
attend this afternoon in Ajaccio, capital of Corsica, the funeral of
Claude Erignac, the prefect of Corsica who was killed Friday. The
murder, which remains unclaimed, caused a wave of shock to the local
population and political circle of the island, whose passiveness in
the face of violence is blamed for the breeding of a mafia economy
in Corsica.
</P>
<P>
-- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has expressed his support to the
United States in case of a military raid against Iraq. At the risk
of isolating France, which continues to plead for a diplomatic
solution to the Iraqi crisis, Kohl went further by claiming that the
stand of Germay represents that of the majority of the Western camp.

<HEADLINE> Eastern Chinese City Getting More Taiwanese Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Fuzhou, the capital of east
China's Fujian Province, has made good use of its proximity to
Taiwan Island in developing its economy, and Taiwan is the second
largest source of overseas capital in the city, providing 2.64
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan-backed projects average two million U.S. dollars each,
and Fuzhou has four Taiwan-funded enterprises each with an
investment of more than 100 million U.S. dollars and 70 each with
more than 10 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The investment has had a cumulative effect on the city's
development zones. The Fuzhou Development Zone now has 1.1 billion
U.S. dollars worth of Taiwan investment, accounting for over 40
percent of the city's total, and similar investment makes up some
a third of that in the Rongqiao Development Zone, where a Taiwan
Industrial Village has taken shape.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Taiwan investment has shifted from
manufacturing to high value-added industries like precision
instruments, electronics, precision chemicals, and automobiles.
</P>
<P>
More Taiwan investors are looking at the agricultural sector
also. The city has approved 121 Taiwan-funded companies engaged in
agricultural development, bringing a total investment of 260
million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> US Against Technology Transfer to India: Scientist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States is opposed
to technology transfer to India, Press Trust of India (PTI) quoted
U.S.-based Indian scientist Dr. K. R. Dronamraju as saying here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
They see India as a potential threat and future competition, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Dronamraju, who recently visited India, is president of
Houston-based Foundation for Genetic Research.
</P>
<P>
He accused the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of threatening
U.S.-based Indian scientists, their families and using other
strong-arm tactics in preventing transfer of technology in key
areas to India.
</P>
<P>
He said of late CIA was trying to thwart technology transfer in
key research programs like space, biotechnology, genetics and
atomic energy.
</P>
<P>
In an interview preceded by a series of talks when he was here
recently, Dronamraju said that though such tactics were used
before, the pressure has been intense of late.
</P>
<P>
"At least on three or four occasions, participants in
conferences, who first planned to attend, were intimidated by
threatening phone calls forcing them to cancel their plans to
attend the particular conference, he said.

countries, has been refined.

making use of their own currencies to trade among them.

Of the majors, Commonwealth Bank closed down 10 cents, National
Australia Bank dropped one cent, ANZ was down one while Westpac
gained 2.2.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Weighed Down by Gold Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar shed
half a U.S. cent from Friday's close, weighed down by low gold
prices, concerns over the widening current account deficit, and
technical factors.
</P>
<P>
The local currency finished the local session at 67.05 U.S.
cents, from 67.58 locally late Friday. It had begun the day at
66.97 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
ANZ head of foreign exchange sales John Reedyk said the
Australian dollar was mainly traded on technical factors Monday,
while gold was also a major consideration.
</P>
<P>
"Generally the gold price is keeping the Aussie under
pressure," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nikko Securities Australia Ltd. chief economist Peter Horn said
he expected the Australian dollar to remain in a 63-to-67 U.S.
cents range through the second quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
"The inevitable deterioration in the trade and current account
balance over coming months is the principal reason I remain
negative on the Australian dollar," said Horn.
</P>
<P>
IBJ Australia senior foreign exchange dealer Darrin Stewart
said some traders were staying on the sideline while events in
Iraq unfolded.
</P>
<P>
Stewart said the Australian dollar had benefited from such
conflict in the past.
</P>
<P>
"Historically when there has been some military action in that
part of the world, the Aussie has acted as a safe haven," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But we already know the U.S. dollar is fairly strong which can
have the effect of weakening the Australian dollar," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished the session at 83.60 Japanese
yen, down from 83.87 Friday and at 1.2140 German marks, up from
1.2086.

<HEADLINE> Corsican Militants Claim Murder of French Prefect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Unidentified Corsican nationalist
militants Monday claimed responsibility for the murder of the
prefect of the Mediterranean island, Claude Erignac, last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse (AFP) said that the militants sent an
unsigned but authenticated communique to Corsican newspapers
Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
``The action that we claim today is perfectly reflected and
highly political. It is not the fruit of any sort of... isolated
action of the `lost soldiers' of the nationalist fight, less of a
job of bearded extremists as some have affirmed,'' said the
communique.
</P>
<P>
Police said that the description in the communique of the type
of pistol used in the assassination conforms with the one which was
found not far from the scene of the assassination, which took place
in Ajaccio, the capital of Corsica, Friday night.
</P>
<P>
On his way to a classical music concert, Erignac was killed by
two young men, who sprayed a rain of bullet on him from a
running-by car, according to witnesses.
</P>
<P>
The assassination of Erignac has caused a wave of shock to the
local populaton and political circle of Corsica, who are blaimed
for remaining passive in the face of violence perpetrated by mafia
groups on the island.
</P>
<P>
Many French politicians have indicated that the murder is more a
job of the mafias disguised as nationalists.

<HEADLINE> Tax Revenues From Foreign Investors In Northeastern Port City Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Dalian, a port city in northeast
China's Liaoning Province, collected 1.86 billion yuan (224
million US dollars) in taxes from foreign nationals in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The figure accounted for 20 percent of its total industrial and
commercial tax revenues, says a local official.
</P>
<P>
So far, the city has approved 6,600 overseas-financed
businesses, with 13.2 billion U.S. dollars worth of contracts and
actual investment of 5.5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Only 4,990 of the overseas-backed enterprises have gone through
tax registration procedures, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Local tax offices have been cooperating with other government
departments to help create a better investment environment, while
also making sure that there is no tax evasion by foreign nationals.
</P>
<P>
As a result, more than 900 foreign-funded enterprises have
increased their investment by 2.65 billion U.S. dollars, according
to the official.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Threats Hound Quezon City, Metro Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Bomb threats nearly caused
stampede among employees of a private firm and a government
agency, who scampered for safety Monday morning in Quezon City,
Metro Manila.
</P>
<P>
However, the calls, which were made by pranksters, turned to be
a hoax as responding explosive experts failed to find any bombs at
the office of the New San Jose Builders Corporation and the
Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage Administration (MWSS).
</P>
<P>
An unidentified man called up at the office of the New San Jose
Builders Corporation, warning that a bomb has been planted at the
office and will go off exactly at 9 a.m.
</P>
<P>
The caller said the alleged bombing "was in retaliation to the
company's earlier move dismissing three of its welders for unknown
reasons."
</P>
<P>
The explosive experts arrived minutes later, but failed to find
the alleged bomb at the vicinity and instead discovered a hole
inside the manager's office.
</P>
<P>
Probers said the suspect could have dug the hole where he would
place the bomb but failed to do so as government agents
immediately responded to the call.
</P>
<P>
Two hours later, employees of MWSS also received a similar
call. Probers also found no bombs at the scene. Police could not
say whether the calls were made by the same person.

The city's Non-staple Foodstuff Wholesale Company had from
200,000 to 300,000 yuan worth of non-staple foodstuff exports

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Central Bank governor
Gabriel Singson Monday reiterated his view that inflation will
remain single-digit this year in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that the inflation for 1998 could be higher
than last year's 5.1 percent. Economic planners forecast that it
would stand at between 7.5 percent and 8.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Singson held this view notwithstanding the wage increase which
will take effect this month.
</P>

He said that he based his optimism on significant gains in
economic efficiency resulting from the various structural measures
the country have put in place and his bank's continuity in
sustaining monetary discipline to ensure domestic liquidity within
targets.

On the international scene, Singson said the world market price
of crude oil has also been on the downtrend while the currency

<HEADLINE> ISU Comfirms Strips Worn by Dutch Skaters Legal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The International Skating
Union fully endorsed the wind-reducing stripes of foam that the Dutch
speed skaters worn at the speed skating tournament of the Winter
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
ISU technical official Gerd Zimmerman said on Monday that the ISU
and its president Ottaviao Clinquanta confirmed this in their morning
Council meeting. The Speed Skating Council members had approved the
strips at a special meeting on Saturday evening, prior to Sunday
competitions.
</P>
<P>
The stripes are in accordance with the rule that no attachment can
change the shape of the skater's body. Protests on Sunday by Japan and
Norway ere rejected.
</P>
<P>
"We have enjoyed constant progress in speed skating over the years,
including the development of the slap skate last year. If there had
been any question of a breach of rules, we would of course have taken
immediate action, but the Technical Delegates and the ISU Council are
fully satisfied that there is no bread of the rules," Zimmerman said.
</P>
<P>
Dutch skaters Gianni Romme and Ritje Ritsma both rewrote the world
records in the men's 5,000m event on Sunday, with Romme winning the
gold medal at six minutes and 22.20 seconds. The Dutch team revealed
the secret behind the stunning performance was wind tunnels and foam
stripes.
</P>
<P>
Since Lillehammer Olympics, the Dutch have been testing new suits
and body positions in wind tunnels at the University of Delft. They
came up with silicon stripes on the head and lower legs of the body
suits, which reduce air turbulence.
</P>
<P>
Canadian team also used stripes, according to its team leader
Robert Bolduc. But he believed wind tunnel test, which help athletes
adopt more aerodynamic postures, have helped most.
</P>
<P>
"The body position of the skaters is what is decreasing friction,
more than the suits," said Bolduc. "The stripes help a little bit,
but more, it's a psychological advantage."

<HEADLINE> Computers in HK Secondary Schools Outmoded: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Computers in Hong Kong's
secondary schools are too outdated to catch up with the fast
changing age of information technology, according to a survey
released here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Secondary school students in Hong Kong are using outmoded
computers to master the new science and technology," said Patrick
Mok, a member of the Hong Kong Development and Strategic Research
Center, a non-profit organization which conducted the survey in
December 1997.
</P>
<P>
Based on more than 10,000 responses from teachers and students
of 28 local schools, the research finds 86 percent secondary
schools have no more than five multi-media computers. Out-of-date
models take a lion's share of computers used in these schools.
</P>
<P>
Mok said that 53 percent secondary schools have fewer than 20
computers, falling short of the demand of students. Secondary
schools now lack adequate technology support and sufficient
resources to upgrade computers and relevant equipment, he added.
</P>
<P>
The survey also finds that in Hong Kong's secondary schools,
nearly 87 percent teachers and 70 percent students have their own
computers. Despite the high proportion of ownership, most teachers
see computers only as efficient typewriters, while many students
regard them as means of entertainment.
</P>
<P>
Mok hoped that the survey could provide a reference for the
Special Administrative Region (SAR) government to map out and
implement information technology education policy in the near
future.

<HEADLINE> OIC Works to Avert Strike against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) Ezzidine Laraki said
OIC will do its utmost to avert any military strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival early Monday morning for a visit to Egypt, he said
that OIC also stresses that Baghdad should comply with and
implement all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The OIC chief praised Egypt's diplomatic efforts for settling
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said his current visit to Cairo would be an opportunity for
holding consultations with President Hosni Mubarak "for the good
of Islam and the Muslims and for activating the Middle East peace
process."
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Laraki will take part in meetings of the
OIC Expert Committee, due to begin later Monday. These meetings
are of importance as they deal with Islamic action in face of
challenges in the future, Laraki added.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Voice of the Arabs Radio Sunday, Laraki
said that he has sent a message to U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan on avoiding military option in the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has been refusing U.N. arms inspectors' access to
presidential palaces, which it regards as signs of sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. weapons inspectors must certify that Iraq has
eliminated all weapons of mass destruction before the Security
Council can order the lifting of crippling economic sanctions,
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Washington has beefed up military buildup in the Gulf and
heightened its threat of military attacks to force Iraq to comply
with U.N. resolutions to grant arms inspectors full access to
sensitive sites if diplomatic efforts fail to defuse crisis.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has accused the U.S. of trying to block the removal of
embargo and prolonging the suffering of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The past several days have witnessed intense international
diplomatic efforts to find a peaceful way out of the crisis and
avert a possible U.S. military strike against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Plans to Close Some Trade Offices Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Ministry of
International Trade and Industry (MITI) plans to close some of the
operations of its local and overseas branches and agencies to
reduce costs.
</P>
<P>
"We are studying to readjust investments on MITI offices in and
outside the country and to close any offices which can be
monitored from the central offices in the states or managed by
nearby states," International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah
Aziz told newsmen after a function here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The cost-cutting measure is to ensure effectiveness of MITI's
branches and agencies, she said.
</P>
<P>
Some branches and agencies of the Malaysian External Trade
Development Corporation (MATRADE) and the Malaysian Industrial
Development Authority (MIDA) are also involved in the cost-cutting
measure.
</P>
<P>
Rafidah said that because of the stronger U.S. dollar, some
overseas operations will be closed and they will be reopened when
the situation warrants it.
</P>
<P>
She said MITI plans to close three local branches and the
officers involved will be redeployed to MITI's head-office here.
</P>
<P>
Rafidah added that some key overseas offices, like those in
Brussels, London and Tokyo, will be maintained because they deal
with regional, international as well as bilateral policy matters.
</P>
<P>
She added MITI is in the final stage of reviewing the matter
and will make an announcement soon.
</P>
<P>
MITI has 11 overseas offices and seven local branches. MATRADE
has 23 overseas offices, while MIDA has 12 overseas and 13 local
offices. All the offices deal with policies, investments and the
export of products.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 9 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's gold bars exports
surged by 54.3 percent last month compared with the same period a
year ago in an effort to tide over its financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
It exported 696 million U.S. dollars worth of gold in January,
which accounted for 16.1 percent of the total exports of 4.33
billion dollars of the month, the Korea International Trade
Association said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the exported gold bars were donations at home made to
help the nation out of the current financial crisis caused by
corporate failures and bad loans of financial institutions in late
1997.
</P>
<P>
Once the 11th largest economy in the world, South Korea is in
dire need of hard currency to tide over the financial storm, which
swept most of the Southeast Asian countries and some East Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
An agreement has been signed with the International Monetary
Fund for a rescue loan of 57 billion dollars, under which South
Korea has to restructure its economy and open its market among
the other harsh conditions tied with the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The nation has to pay a large part of its foreign debts
totaling 154 billion dollars this year.

TEHRAN, February 9 (Xinhua) - Leader of the Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan (PUK) Jalal Talabani arrived here Sunday heading a
delegation which also included members of other Kurdish parties.
</P>
<P>
Local daily Tehran Times quoted an informed source as saying
that Talabani and the Kurdish delegation was invited to attend the
10-day Dawn ceremonies marking the 19th anniversary of the Islamic
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
The Kurdish delegation comprised of senior officials from the
Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP), Iraqi Socialist Party, Hizb
Herkat-e Islami (Islamic Movement Party), Democratic Party,
Conservatives Party, Assyrian Party, Islamic Union as well as
other groups.
</P>
<P>
Talabani and other Kurdish leaders will meet with Iranian
officials to exchange views on the current situation in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi Kurds gained relative autonomy after the Western
allies imposed a "no-fly" zone in northern Iraq. However,
factional fightings erupted in the region due to the hostile
atmosphere among different groups, particularly between the PUK
and the KDP.
</P>
<P>
Iran is reportedly the major supporter of the PUK while Iraqi
government allegedly backs the KDP in their struggle for dominance
in northern Iraq.

opposition party left-wing AKEL and the central-right Democratic
Party, gained a marginal lead over Clerides with 160,918 votes or
40.61 percent.
</P>
<P>
Clerides, who has the full backing of the ruling right-wing
Democratic Rally party, got 40.06 percent with 158,763 votes.
</P>
<P>
Under the constitution of Cyprus, if no candidate secures more
than 50 percent of votes in the first ballot, a second ballot will
take place on the following Sunday between the two front-runners.
</P>
<P>
Voting started early Sunday morning at 1,023 polling stations
throughout the country and ended at 17:00 local time (1500 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The announcement said just over two percent of the votes cast
were invalid and 1.2 percent were blank votes. A total of 396,299
votes were valid, out of a total of 409,979 votes cast.
</P>
<P>
The number of registered voters was 446,731, which included
for the first time 18 to 20-year-old persons.
</P>
<P>
After the first round, the two contenders are expected to seek
cooperation with the smaller parties and will probably be more
keen to attract supporters of the socialist EDEK party, whose
candidate, Vassos Lyssarides, obtained 41,978 votes, accounting
for 10.59 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
Both Iacovou and Clerides said the outcome of Sunday's run-off
will be decisive in shaping developments in Cyprus as far as the
U.N.-sponsored peace effort is concerned to end the island's
division.
</P>
<P>
The new president of the republic will also have to tackle
issues pertaining Cyprus' application for membership of the
European Union (EU), as accession talks are due to begin in April.
</P>
<P>
Using the slogans "a decision of responsibility" and "hope for
security," Clerides stresses the need for responsible strategy in
the handling of both the accession negotiations with the EU and
the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Iacovou, who has promoted his campaign on the slogans "new
inspiration, new course," criticized Clerides for a sell-out in
Cyprus problem and calls for a change of government to allow for
realistic initiatives to end the deadlock in the peace effort.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, which gained independence from British colonial rule in
1960, has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.

<HEADLINE> Kenya, Tanzania Quarrel over Transit Trucks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 9 (Xinhua)-- Dozens of Tanzanian transit
trucks were blocked at the Kenyan border town of Namanga after
Kenya demanded that they get customs bonds in Nairobi, thus sparking
a border row between the two neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
A check at Namanga found a chaotic bottleneck of at least 30
Tanzanian-registered trucks, Monday's East African newspaper
reported. The trucks, Coming mostly from Dar-es-Salaam, wanted to
cross part of Kenya to reach Musoma and other towns in northwest
Tanzania or areas beyond, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The trucks are being forced into Kenya because of extensive
damage to Tanzania's upcountry road network by the El Nino rains.
</P>
<P>
A senior Kenyan customs official said all transit truckers
without a bond are required to leave their vehicles at the
border, travel to Nairobi, process the bonds there, and return to
the border to collect their trucks and loads.
</P>
<P>
Some drivers said they had been waiting for over one week,
unsure what to do after being denied entry by Kenyan Customs for
lack of a bond guarantee from Nairobi,a requirement they said was
new to them.
</P>
<P>
The requirement violated a decision made by the Common Market
for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) in Dar-es-Salaam last
week, the Tanzanian drivers complained. Both Kenya and Tanzania
are members of the 19-nation COMESA.
</P>
<P>
The organization at the time announced measures to eliminate
the procedure that requires bonds for transit traffic in each
COMESA country and set out a COMESA-wide customs bond guarantee
scheme.
</P>
<P>
"Stakeholders have been assigned specific responsibilities and
we envisage that the system will be operations in all COMESA
transit corridors by October 1998," said COMESA Secretary-General
J. Mwencha.
</P>
<P>
He said the scheme was expected to release more than 200
million U.S. Dollars currently tied down in bonds.
</P>
<P>
"All member states have agreed to ratify it as soon as
possible to eliminate the need to open and close customs bond
guarantees at each port of entry," Mwencha said.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Opposition Leader Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's Veteran politician and
leader of the opposition National Party (NP) Humphrey Mulemba
died of cancer in a London hospital on Sunday, Zambia Daily Mail
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper quoted his nephew Ludwig Sondashi as
saying that Mulenba died at the age of 65 in London where he was
flown to seek further specialized treatment following an
unsuccessful operation he underwent in Harare, the capital of
Zimbabwe, where he was diagnosed with cancer of the stomach.
</P>
<P>
Mulemba spent over 40 years of his life as a politician and was
one of the founder members of the now opposition United National
Independence Party (UNIP) led by former president Kenneth Kaunda.
</P>
<P>
He served as deputy speaker of the National Assembly in the
UNIP government and held several ministerial portfolios in the
same government.
</P>
<P>
After the now ruling Movement for Multi-party Democracy (MMD)
won the multi-party elections in 1991, he was appointed as mines
minister.
</P>
<P>
But he quitted the MMD party and formed his opposition NP in
1993.
</P>
<P>
Information Minister David Mpamba was quoted by Times of
Zambia as saying that it is sad that Zambia has lost a
responsible politician who fought tirelessly for the independence
of the country.

<HEADLINE> Hackl Takes Third Olympic Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Georg Hackl of Germany
collected his third consecutive Olympic gold medal when he won the
men's singles luge at the 18th Olympic Winter Games in Spiral track on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hackl, gold medalist at Albertville and Lillehammer, broke the
track record twice in recording the four fastest runs over the two-day
competition. He finished with a aggregate time of three minutes 18.346
seconds.
</P>
<P>
Armin Zoeggler of Italy took the silver in 3:18.939. Jens Mueller
of Germany won the bronze in 3:19.093.
</P>
<P>
India's Shiva Keshavan, the sole competitor from the country at the
Olympics, finished 28th among 34 competitors.
</P>
<P>
"It was really wonderful to take part in the games," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hackl, who wore a pair of new yellow race booties during race, had
drawn protests from the U.S. and Canadian teams Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The race jury threw out the protests.
</P>
<P>
Luge regulations stipulate race boots should be equally available
to all competitors. Both the Canadians and Americans had said they
were unable to buy the new aerodynamic footwear because the
manufacturer said it lacked raw materials.
</P>
<P>
But even they conceded Hackl needed no help from his equipment.
Hackl himself conceded that the yellow booties might cut run times by
two or three hundredths of a second, it might be the color that had
drawn attention, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I think if they were black, no one would say anything," he added.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Air Crash Rescuers Retrieve More Cadaver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-three more cadaver bags
were airlifted Monday from the crash site of the Cebu Pacific
Flight 387, bringing to 65 the total number of cadaver bags
recovered since rescue operations started Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The "Task Force Pacific," a combined rescue team comprising the
air force, the Philippine Army, Cebu Pacific management and
volunteer rescue groups, had already accounted 65 cadaver bags
from the crash site, the Philippine News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Jesus Dureza, head of the Presidential Action Center who acts
as the general supervisor of the rescue efforts, said the cadaver
bags containing body parts will undergo an intensive forensic
examination to determine the identification of the victims.
</P>
<P>
Dureza said forensic experts from Europe and the local National
Bureau of Investigation have been segregating the recovered body
parts since Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said relatives of the victims will immediately be notified
once the experts complete the identification, adding that "we want
to be 100 percent sure of the victim's identity."
</P>
<P>
Santos Gabison, commander of the army's Fourth Infantry
Division, also confirmed Monday morning the recovery of the
plane's Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) from the crash site.
</P>
<P>
The CVR, which recorded conversations and communication of the
pilots while the aircraft was flying, will be important in
determining the cause of the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
Monday afternoon, local TV also reported that rescuers had
found the black box, or the Flight Data Recorder, which contained
important information including the speed, direction, altitude of
the plane before the crash.
</P>
<P>
The black box would help investigators determine the cause of
the country's worst air accident in recent years, in which 99
passengers and five crew members aboard were all feared killed.
</P>
<P>
The ill-fated Cebu Pacific Flight 387 was bound for Cagayan de
Oro city in the southern island of Mindanao from Manila when it
slammed on a 6500 feet-high mountain in Misamis Oriental province
last Monday.

<HEADLINE> China Wants To Export More To Southeastern Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- China will increase exports of
machinery and electronic products to southeastern Africa to meet
growing demand there, according to today's International Business
Daily.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese customs, China exported some 440 million
US dollars worth of machinery and the same amount of electronic
products to 25 countries there in 1996 and 1997, accounting for 42
percent of its exports to the region.
</P>
<P>
Trade with southeastern Africa amounts to 2.1 billion US
dollars worth a year, but that was a mere two percent of the
region's total annual trade of 102.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
Southeastern Africa covers 10 million sq.km. of land and has
270 million people and a growing demand for mechanical and
electrical equipment to help the economy.
</P>
<P>
China's machinery and electronic products are of a technical
level more suited to this area than equipment from more developed
countries, so China has good prospects here.
</P>
<P>
The daily suggests that Chinese companies should promote
themselves more, participate in public bids, establish joint
ventures in those countries, and improve service.

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls on UN to Ease Sanctions Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Iran has called on the U.N. to
ease sanctions against Iraq and lift the ban of the flight of
humanitarian relief aids to Iraq, the Iranian official news agency
IRNA reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
IRNA quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi as
saying Sunday that Iran is ready to help send relief aids to the
Iraqi people in the framework U.N. Security Council decisions.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was referring to a second Russian air shipment of
medicines to Iraq through Iran, which was arranged by the Russian
Liberal Party headed by Vladimir Zhirinowsky but was delayed due
to lack of permission from the U.N. Sanctions Committee.
</P>
<P>
The second humanitarian flight with 45 Russian parliament
members was scheduled to arrive in Iraq Monday. But the takeoff
was delayed for 10 hours Sunday due to Iran's rejection of letting
it pass through the Iranian airspace on the pretext that the
U.N. did not approve the flight. Reports said that the
U.N. Sanctions Committee would meet on the issue Monday.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Russian Foreign Ministry said Iran can force land
the plane over its airspace for inspection if Iran suspects the
plane to be carrying prohibited consignment.
</P>
<P>
The first Russian flight with five tonnes of medical relief
consignment was blocked by Iran on December 23, 1997. The plane
was allowed to enter Iraq upon a U.N. Sanctions Committee
permission after a three-day delay in Iran's western province of
Kermanshah.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iran's diplomatic mission to the U.N. announced
that due to acute shortage of foodstuff facing the Iraqi people,
children in particular, Iran is ready to help in sending the
Russian relief supplies to Baghdad within the framework of the
U.N. regulations.

a border row between the two neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
A check at Namanga found a chaotic bottleneck of at least 30
Tanzanian-registered trucks, Monday's East African newspaper
reported. The trucks, Coming mostly from Dar-es-Salaam, wanted to
cross part of Kenya to reach Musoma and other towns in northwest
Tanzania or areas beyond, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The trucks are being forced into Kenya because of extensive
damage to Tanzania's upcountry road network by the El Nino rains.
</P>
<P>
A senior Kenyan customs official said all transit truckers
without a bond are required to leave their vehicles at the
border, travel to Nairobi, process the bonds there, and return to
the border to collect their trucks and loads.
</P>
<P>
Some drivers said they had been waiting for over one week,
unsure what to do after being denied entry by Kenyan Customs for
lack of a bond guarantee from Nairobi,a requirement they said was
new to them.
</P>
<P>
The requirement violated a decision made by the Common Market
for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) in Dar-es-Salaam last
week, the Tanzanian drivers complained. Both Kenya and Tanzania
are members of the 19-nation COMESA.
</P>
<P>
The organization at the time announced measures to eliminate
the procedure that requires bonds for transit traffic in each
COMESA country and set out a COMESA-wide customs bond guarantee
scheme.
</P>
<P>
"Stakeholders have been assigned specific responsibilities and
we envisage that the system will be operations in all COMESA
transit corridors by October 1998," said COMESA Secretary-General
J. Mwencha.
</P>
<P>
He said the scheme was expected to release more than 200
million U.S. Dollars currently tied down in bonds.
</P>
<P>
"All member states have agreed to ratify it as soon as
possible to eliminate the need to open and close customs bond
guarantees at each port of entry," Mwencha said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's Veteran politician and
leader of the opposition National Party (NP) Humphrey Mulemba
died of cancer in a London hospital on Sunday, Zambia Daily Mail
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper quoted his nephew Ludwig Sondashi as
saying that Mulenba died at the age of 65 in London where he was
flown to seek further specialized treatment following an
unsuccessful operation he underwent in Harare, the capital of
Zimbabwe, where he was diagnosed with cancer of the stomach.
</P>
<P>
Mulemba spent over 40 years of his life as a politician and was
one of the founder members of the now opposition United National
Independence Party (UNIP) led by former president Kenneth Kaunda.
</P>
<P>
He served as deputy speaker of the National Assembly in the
UNIP government and held several ministerial portfolios in the
same government.
</P>
<P>
After the now ruling Movement for Multi-party Democracy (MMD)
won the multi-party elections in 1991, he was appointed as mines
minister.
</P>
<P>
But he quitted the MMD party and formed his opposition NP in
1993.
</P>
<P>
Information Minister David Mpamba was quoted by Times of
Zambia as saying that it is sad that Zambia has lost a
responsible politician who fought tirelessly for the independence
of the country.

<HEADLINE> China Helping More Laid-off Workers to Find Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Labor departments throughout
China will do their utmost to help some eight to ten million
workers at state-owned industries to be laid off over the next
three years, today's "People's Daily" quotes Minister of Labor
Li Boyong as saying.
</P>
<P>
Li says that helping as many of them as possible find new jobs
is their major objective to help the state-owned enterprise
reforms ane ensure social stability.
</P>
<P>
He adds that that reforms in state-owned enterprises will be
accelerated in more developed regions where employment
opportunities are greater.
</P>
<P>
Reemployment service centers and other organizations will be
set up across the country, he said, and the collective sector, the
non-state sector, the service sector, and small businesses will
all play a major part in providing more job opportunities to
laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
Various preferential policies will be formulated by the
government to help the unemployed find work, and there will be
more funds for the reemployment project, Li said.
</P>
<P>
These funds will be established across the country, with some
of the unemployment subsidies and unemployment insurance allocated
for helping laid-off workers find work and job service networks or
computer networks among big or medium-sized cities improved, and
labor training increased.
</P>
<P>
An effort will also be made to introduce pension, medical
insurance, and housing systems, and the best way to get laid-off
workers out of poverty is to help them be employed, Li stressed.

<HEADLINE> Beijing's City Government Being Given Closer Look By Lawmakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Lawmakers in Beijing are taking
a closer look at government activities in the Chinese capital,
which has suffered some severe setbacks because of criminal
activities of top officials.
</P>
<P>
The case of former Beijing Party chief Chen Xitong and former
vice-mayor Wang Baosen, which went public in 1995, has caused the
Municipal People's Congress and the People's Political
Consultative Conference to increase supervision of the city
government.
</P>
<P>
Priority has been given to the budget, because local lawmakers
believe that Chen and Wang and their collaborators got some quick
money to support their luxurious lifestyle by their unsavory
financial activities.
</P>
<P>
The activities of local law-enforcement departments, including
the police and the courts, have also received greater scrutiny,
and hearings have been held regularly by Municipal People's
Congress Standing Committee to check the progress in the city's
anti-corruption drive.
</P>
<P>
For the past several years, a series of rules have been passed
to ensure cleaner more efficient government in a more democratic
and scientific way, and the Regulations on Supervising Beijing
Municipality are being formulated, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, local lawmakers have put forth 52,300 proposals on
local government work. Local lawmakers attribute the problems to
"illegal activities conducted by leading officials and
law-enforcement departments".
</P>
<P>
Mayor Jia Qinglin recently urged government to strictly follow
instructions and abide by the supervisory work of local People's
Congresses and People's Political Consultative Conferences.

accountability and restructuring of cooperative debts.

<P>
Shivakumar said it is time for Thailand to carry out
privatization and the key to success is to have a precise
regulatory framework to pass the message on to the public.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank official also said Thailand must set up a
national panel to oversee regulations, work out a privatization
master program and reconsider plans for different sectors so that
they are consistent with national objectives.
</P>
<P>
He said Thai state enterprises are at different stages of
privatization.
</P>
<P>
Thai Airways International is already listed and the
Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand has made progress
while the telecommunications sector will need a master plan to
avoid turning a public monopoly into a private monopoly, he said.
</P>
<P>
Shivakumar also pointed out that privatization has a clear link
with the management of the state budget and it should be done at a
proper pace and with certain objectives for budget relief and
efficiency.

<HEADLINE> Prodi: No Decision Yet on Italian Bases for U.S. Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Italy has hinted it has yet to
decide whether to allow United States forces to use Italian bases
for a possible attack on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi, who has been on vaction in
Bologna, said today, "I do not answer questions about these
things". He had been asked about reports that Italy would not
allow the United States to use North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) bases on its soil for a strike on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
But the Italian news agency, Ansa, quoted informed sources as
saying that Italy has frequently expressed support for a
diplomatic solution to the crisis between Iraq and the United
Nations as the way to avoid the use of force. But it did not
"automatically" rule out the use of Italian bases in an attack.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Italy has so far received no U.S. request to
use bases on its territory for an attack on Iraq. "If the request
should arrive, it would be examined by the government as a whole,"
the sources said. "As things stand, one can not rule out a prior
authorization being given."
</P>
<P>
"There has been no request, and no decision, one way or the
other, has been taken," the sources explained. "But the situation
does not allow ruling out authorization. There has been no
consideration of the question precisely because no request has
been made."
</P>
<P>
Prodi also followed his firm "no comment" on the use of the
bases, and was equally noncommital on the apparent differences of
opinion between the E.U. nations on the advisability of an
American military intervention in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
No official comment was forthcoming from the prime minister's
office here on either topic, and the government spokesman, Ricardo
Franco Levy, simply referred journalists to what Prodi said at a
trade-union conference in Bologna two days ago.
</P>
<P>
Prodi told the conference he had asked the Italian charge
d'affaires to urge the Iraqi authorities to open up all sites to
U.N. controls, and he repeated that there is still space for
diplomatic moves.
</P>
<P>
He also said the Italian government has made "every effort" in
order for diplomacy to prevail. It had voiced confidence in moves
to be pursued through pressure on Iraq, and a "frank" exchange
with the United States. "This means a frank and serious
relationship of alliance."
</P>
<P>
A week ago, Italian military experts were convinced that
Italian bases would not be offered for use in a U.S. military
action against Iraq. They said they thought a military attack
would fail to produce "decisive results" in the struggle to gain
access for U.N. arms inspectors to suspected chemical weapons
sites in Iraq.

<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Finnish skier Mika Myllyliae
defeated strong Norwegian team to win the men's cross country skiing
30km classical race at the 18th Olympic Winter Games on Monday.
</P>
<P>
With other events on snow cancelled or delayed of the day,
Myllyliae has been the only hero to ski through snow flakes. He
crossed the finishing line at one hour 33 minutes and 55.8 seconds,
beating Erling Jevne of Norway and Silvio Fauner of Italy to the
second and third. Jevne and Fauner were 1:31.3 and 2:12.7 slower off
the pace.
</P>
<P>
Myllyliae, 28, gained his fame after winning te grueling 50km at
the 1997 World Championships in Trondheim, Norway in spite of the
heavy rainfall.
</P>
<P>
World number one Thomas Algaard of Norway pulled out of the race
midway through the race. He was 50th at the time.
</P>
<P>
In another surprising development, his countryman Bjorn Daelie,
ranked second in the world and dominant figure in men's cross country
throughout the 1990s, finished in 20th place.
</P>
<P>
The Finland delegation chief Tapani Ilkka credited the poor
performance of the Norwegian team with mistakes in choosing wax for
the race.
</P>
<P>
"Normally, they are very good in waxing. Te conditions are
exceptionally difficult," Ikka said, adding that he believed that
choices in waxing was the determining factor.
</P>
<P>
"I was at one point at the five kilometer (mark) and I could see
that they had no chance in the competition." he added. "The skis were
so sticky and no glide at all."

MANILA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' exports revenue
reached 25.23 billion U.S. dollars in 1997, rising by 22.8
percent, the National Statistics Office (NSO) said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The NSO said the growth was primed by the performance of
electronics and components as well as input/output peripheral
units whose combined value increased by 258.8 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
For December alone, the exports receipt gained 18.4 percent to
2.23 billion dollars from the year-ago level. Electronics and
components, articles of apparel and clothing accessories as well
as input/output peripheral units were the country's top exported
items.
</P>
<P>
Value of manufactured goods accounted for about 85.6 percent of
December's total exports, moving up by 23.3 percent to 1.9 billion
dollars, the NSO said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the United States remained the Philippines' No. 1
trading partner in 1997, importing a total of 7.68 billion dollars
of Philippine goods.
</P>
<P>
The United States was followed by Japan, Singapore, China's
Hong Kong, Britain and other countries and regions, the NSO said.

The Fin skier admitted that the time when he crossed the finishing

his life.
</P>
<P>
"The biggest day in my life was when my son was born," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that it was very tough to ski in such a driving snow
condition. "I felt like dying after the first kilometer. But it is not
the worst thing," he said.

"Our ex-coach said that the worst thing that can happen to you is

<HEADLINE> Thailand Pushes for New ASEAN Investment Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will push for the
early creation of an ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian
Nations) investment area.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's International Economic Policy Committee will propose
the move at a meeting of senior ASEAN investment officials
scheduled to be held in Myanmar later this month, the local press
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The committee, chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Supachai
Panitchpakdi, wants to shorten the time frame for the new
investment zone from the earlier agreed year of 2010 to 2003.
</P>
<P>
Under the Thai proposal, ASEAN would have to remove all
barriers to regional investment by 2003, except for new members
Vietnam, Myanmar and Laos.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN summit in Bangkok in December 1995 provided the spark
for the creation of the investment area in hope that the
liberalization of as many industries as possible would attract
foreign investment to the region.

<HEADLINE> Romania's First Nuclear Station Goes Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Romania's power supply has
greatly improved since its first nuclear power station went into
operation a year ago.
</P>
<P>
At 5.4 billion kilowatt-hour (kwh), the first generating unit
of the Cernavoda Nuclear Power Station provided ten percent of the
total electric energy production of Romania last year.
</P>
<P>
The Cernavoda Station, located on the east bank of the Danube
River, 170 kilometers east of Bucharest, was first built in the
early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear power station, which adopted Canadian technology,
was designed to be composed of five reactors, each with a power of
700,000 kwh.
</P>
<P>
The first generating unit of the station was put into use at
the end of 1996, following delays to the project because of
financial problems.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian government has given priority to the construction
of the station's second generating unit in its next five-year
development plan.
</P>
<P>
The second generating unit could go into operation in the year
2000 if the funds could be guaranteed, experts said.

<HEADLINE> Southern Chinese Province Sets 1998 Economic Goals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong Province, an
economic power house in China, plans a 10 percent increase in its
GDP for 1998 and a retail price index held below three percent.
</P>
<P>
The province wants to raise output value of high and new
technology companies from 1997's 120 billion yuan to 150 billion
yuan Priority will be given to electronic information, new
materials, and the integration of light industry, machinery,
electronics, bio-technology, and energy.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong will try new forms of overseas investment such as
investment in the stock right and investment by international
funds. Last year, it used 81.1 billion US dollars in overseas
funds, which accounted for a quarter of its capital construction
and helped provide jobs for nearly 10 million people.
</P>
<P>
The province will make the most of Hong Kong's return to the
motherland in capital raising efforts, because some 80 percent of
its overseas investment, exports, imports, and joint ventures have
to do with Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong is making greater effort at its unemployment project
to help 70 percent of those who have been laid off find new jobs
to bring the urban unemployment rate to below 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
It will also try to balance economic growth and environmental
protection, with prevention of acid rain and use of unleaded
gasoline high on the agenda It wants to treat 87.9 percent of
industrial emissions, 58.3 percent of waste water, and 92.9
percent of solid wastes.

<HEADLINE> Non-Public Sector Brisk in Liaoning Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Liaoning Province, in
northeastern China, was dominated by its State-owned sector for
decades, but is now devoting its efforts to the non-state-owned
sector to make it a new area of economic growth this year.
</P>
<P>
At the first session of the Ninth Provincial People's Congress
recently in Shenyang, the provincial capital, 12 deputies urged
the formulation of a regulation for private enterprises,
while other deputies called for a regulation on private economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning has 1.06 million private and individually-owned
companies with a total workforce of two million, and 32 billion
yuan of registered capital.
</P>
<P>
At the recent People's Congress, it was decided that this
workforce would be increased 15 percent this year and private
firms would be encouraged to get involved in high-tech
development, the export-oriented economy, and enterprise groups.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the output value of these companies at or above the
township level was 163 billion yuan, almost twice the 1992 figure
and accounting for half the output value of enterprises at or
above township level in the province.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Philippines' Exit in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has approved that the Philippines could graduate from it by
March this year, the local press reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed over the weekend by IMF representative David
Nellor, who said the IMF has approved the extension of the
country's existing program to March, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines should have exited from the IMF's 35-year
tutelage early last year after completing its comprehensive tax
reform, a three-year program required by the multinational
institution.
</P>
<P>
However, the Philippine Supreme Court last year ruled as
"unconstitutional" an oil deregulation law already passed by the
two chambers of the congress and signed by President Fidel Ramos,
forcing the country to pass a new law before graduating from the
IMF.
</P>
<P>
Also because of the financial turmoil sweeping across the
region, the Philippines has repeatedly delayed its graduation from
the IMF.
</P>
<P>
A new oil deregulation bill was approved by the congress last
week and is scheduled to be signed into law by President Ramos on
Monday.

<HEADLINE> Hotline Helping Poor Families In Eastern Chinese City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The family of Hou Guiju, in
Shandong Province's port city of Qingdao, were facing a bleak
Spring Festival this year, but she picked up the phone and called
the city's Help-the-Poor Hotline for a solution.
</P>
<P>
She explained that her husband had died a few days before,
leaving her with a 90-year-old mother-in-law and two daughters,
one of whom is mentally retarded and one with heart disease, and
she had no idea about how to get through the holidays with a
monthly income of only 140 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Spring Festival, China's Lunar New Year, fell on January 28
this year, and leaders of the city's Federation of Trade Unions
rushed to her home with 200 yuan in cash, two bottles of cooking
oil, flour, and other necessities. They wished her a happy Chinese
Near Year and told her to take good care of her family members.
</P>
<P>
Hou was just one of many local poor families who have received
assistance from the people operating the hotline in this eastern
Chinese city.
</P>
<P>
The federation has files on 2,600 needy families and started
the hotline with two telephones on December 29 to make sure that
all of the families would have access to help of some kind,
explains Wang Zhongsheng, who is in charge of the hotline.
</P>
<P>
Since then, they have received dozens of calls every day, with
complaints about various problems like getting reimbursed for
medical costs, delayed payment of unemployed worker assistance or
wages from local enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The hotline staff members write down the complaints and hand
them over to the federation which does its best to solve the
problem in the shortest possible time and asks government
departments to respond within four days.
</P>
<P>
The hotline has been welcomed by local people, many of whom say
that it has been a means for them to voice their real feelings.
</P>
<P>
State-owned factories in Qingdao have laid off 140,000 workers,
but 100,000 have found new jobs with the help of government
reemployment programs.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning Achieves Bumper Grain Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province recorded a good grain harvest in 1997 in spite of severe
natural disasters, with the total grain output reaching 13.14
billion kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the 1997 per capita income of local
farmers grew by seven percent on the 1996 figure.
</P>
<P>
Increases in grain output and rural income were attributed to
the promotion and use of agricultural techniques. The provincial
government succeeded in improving the grain output by attaching
great importance to agricultural industrialization.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that some 6.03 million local farmers
completed technical training programs during 1997.
</P>
<P>
The local government allocated 20 million yuan during the year
to promote agricultural technology, up five percentage points on
1996.
</P>
<P>
Various private enterprises and individual business people also
increased their investment in agricultural development.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Central Bank to Watch Banks' Top Borrowers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines would closely watch the exposure of banks to their top
100 borrowers as part of its new efforts to supervise banks in
light of possible risks brought about by the currency turmoil.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper Business World Monday quoted a central bank
report as saying the focus of the new approach is to determine the
banks' ability to identify and manage the risks rather than point
out violation of rules and validate banking transactions.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's supervision and examination sector will
identify the top 100 borrowers of commercial banks, as well as
those of thrift banks, the report said, adding the coverage of the
new method would expand to the entire banking system.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose is to eventually establish a database involving
top borrowers of the financial system, to determine the extent of
the banks' or their subsidiaries' exposures," the report said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the central bank would also conduct a more
intensive analysis of the financial statements of corporate
borrowers to assess the impacts of the loan exposures.
</P>
<P>
The central bank also planned to create a "prompt and
corrective action unit" by the end of the month to weed out
"problem banks" in the system and assign a special group to handle
them, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Plastic Surgeons Restore Missing Parts Of Chinese Girl's Face </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, February 9 (Xinhua) -- A four-year-old Chinese girl
who was born with half her face deformed is expected to be given a
normal appearance after undergoing her fourth session of plastic
surgery at the Stomatology Hospital in the city of Shenyang, this
month.
</P>
<P>
The girl, Han Ying, was born into a rural family in the city of
Chaoyang in Liaoning Province with considerable damage to the left
side of her face. There was a cleft palate in the upper part of
her mouth, the left part of her nose was missing, the upper jaw
was deformed, there was a growth above her left eye, and she had
lost her eyesight because of a damaged eyelid and exposed eye.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Li Aiqun, who was in charge of the reconstructive surgery,
said that this was the first case of its kind in China and that
there was no exact description of her condition in medical books.
</P>
<P>
The mother of the unfortunate girl, Cui Yuyan, said she had
experienced nothing ususal during pregnancy and when she caught a
cold during the second month, she didn't take any medicines
because of fear of harming the fetus.
</P>
<P>
In November, the girl began a series of three operations to
remove the growth above her left eye, repair the eyelid, and form
an eye socket and the left part of the bridge of the nose.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Li says the hospital will cover five-sixths of the cost of
surgery and the Liaoning Charitable Society will cover the
remainder for the poor girl's family.
</P>
<P>
The doctor also pointed out that if the girl has an opportunity
to get a cornea transplant, she may recover the eyesight in her
left eye and live the life of a normal child.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Improves Bottom-Line Poverty Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Poverty-stricken families in
Beijing, the Chinese capital, feel much safer since the city
government adopted new policies to ensure the subsistence level of
urban residents living below the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
In July 1996, the city set a bottom-line per capita income of
170 yuan per month for poverty-stricken urban families, and 11
months later raised the level to 190 yuan.
</P>
<P>
However, under the old system, many people working for
loss-making ventures found it difficult to actually receive
bottom-line subsidies from their units and the government.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the city adopted a new policy which requires
municipal and county governments to share related payments on an
equal basis.
</P>
<P>
The new policy stipulates that local urban residents have the
right to apply for subsidies if their per capita income falls
below the prescribed poverty line.
</P>
<P>

<P>
BANGKOK, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will curtail financial
aid programs to neighboring countries, but continue to subsidize
projects under its previous commitment, according to the Prime
Minister's Office Minister Chaiyos Sasomsup.
</P>
<P>
The Technical and Economic Cooperation Department will stop
handing out money to neighboring countries, Chaiyos was quoted
Monday by the local press as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the Thai government will still provide 338 million
baht (6.7 million U.S. dollars) for projects it committed to under
the 1999 fiscal budget. The money will be distributed to Laos,
which will get 178 million baht (3.5 million dollars); Cambodia,
87 million baht (1.7 million dollars); Vietnam, 48 million baht
(960,000 dollars) and Myanmar, 25 million baht (500,000 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The funds will mainly be used for the development of public
health, education and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Chaiyos expressed the hope that Thailand's neighbors will
understand that the country's current economic crisis necessitates
the funding cuts.
</P>
<P>
While helping other countries, Thailand has also received
financial support from developed countries such as Australia,
Germany, Canada and Denmark. Chaiyos said Thailand will receive
2.8 billion dollars in aid for fiscal year 1999.

<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- For those who get dizzy in the
bustling crowds of Beijing's downtown Xidan Shopping Center, you
may soon be able to stroll through soothing parklands, today's
"China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
Construction of a cultural square spanning 20,000 square meters
will start early next month and is planned for completion by
October 1, 1999. Sculpture, performing arts stages and 15,000
square meters of grass land are on the blueprint.
</P>
<P>
The square lies among a forest of buildings competing to change
to skyline of Xidan, which is largely designed for commercial
purposes.
</P>
<P>
It stands between the shopping center and Chang'an Avenue which
demands solemnity. The contrast is expected to be gracefully
softened, said Song Liyun, deputy director of the Xicheng District
Construction Commission.
</P>
<P>
Business prosperity needs people, but people also need a
spacious square to relieve the pressure of dense crowding, Song
said.
</P>
<P>
The Hua Yuan Real Property Co Ltd. will spend about 500 million
yuan (60 million US dollars) building the cultural square, part
of a reconstruction project on the six square kilometer Xidan site
that sits only a stone's throw west of the famous Tian'anmen
Square.

<HEADLINE> China Updating Railway Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- China is introducing updated
technology to improve its railway network, today's "China Daily"
reported.
</P>
<P>
In the next three years, new technology will be widely applied
to communications facilities, and locomotive and safety equipment
production, the newspaper quoted Railways Vice-Minister Fu Zhihuan
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Equipping China's railways with advanced technology will greatly
raise its efficiency in the transportation market. There is
already fierce competition in this market as a result of a rapid
development of road, water and air transportation, said Fu.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is speeding up the establishment of a
transportation management information system. Its use will enable
China's railway communications network to meet international
standards.
</P>
<P>
Another sign of a technological improvement of the country's
railways is that more railways are being electrified. At the end
of last year, China had nearly 12,000 km of electrified railways,
almost 20 percent of the entire network.
</P>
<P>
The proportion is expected to attain 24 percent by the year of
2000 when the country expands its railway network to 68,000 km.
</P>
<P>
China began constructing electrified railways at the end of the
1950s. The first electrified line from Baoji to Chengdu was
completed in 1975.

<HEADLINE> China to Develop Coalbed Methane for New Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- China will develop its abundant
coalbed methane resources as a new clean energy on an industrial
scale, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The China United Coalbed Methane Co Ltd. (CUCBM) and Texaco
Inc. of the United States have signed a contract to jointly
explore coalbed methane resources in the Huaibei coalmine in east
China's Anhui province.
</P>
<P>
The contract was the first of its kind officially approved by
the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Besides the Huaibei project, CUCBM will seek more foreign
cooperation to introduce advanced technology and funds. It is
expected to sign several other contracts in the foreseeable
future.
</P>
<P>
Coalbed methane is an unconventional form of natural gas. To
prevent gas explosions, China emits six billion cubic meters of
methane from mines annually, seriously polluting the environment
and wasting energy resources.
</P>
<P>
CUCBM was set up in 1996 to speed up the country's coalbed
methane development. It was authorized to monopolize the
development of China's whole coalbed methane resources.
</P>
<P>
The State Council granted favourable policies to CUCBM,
including tax reduction, duty exemption and self-decision rights
for investment as import and export businesses.
</P>
<P>
The corporation will set up its scientific and technical
research team to serve the future large-scale development. It is
also ready to seek technical support from other scientific
research institutes.
</P>
<P>
China's coalbed methane reserves are estimated at about 30,000
billion to 35,000 billion cubic meters.

<HEADLINE> Gebrselassie Comes Close to Breaking World Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia
failed by two seconds to set his second world indoor record in as
many weeks Sunday, winning the 1,500 meters in three minutes,
33.27 seconds at the Flanders indoor athletics meet in Ghent.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian said he would take another shot next Sunday in
Birmingham, Britain, at the 1,500 meters mark of 3:31.18 set last
year by Morocco's Hicham El Guerrouj.
</P>
<P>
Gebreselassie broke his own world 3,000-meter indoor record
January 25 at the Karlsruhe meet in Germany. His new record was
short-lived as Daniel Koman of Kenya bettered it on Friday.
</P>
<P>
World outdoor champion Gabriela Szabo won the women's 5,000
meters event in 15:07.41 seconds, more than four seconds outside
the world mark set in 1992 by Britain's Liz McColgan.
</P>
<P>
Maria Mutola of Mozambique won convincingly in the women's 800
meters while Cuba's Ivan Pedroso also had an easy win in the men's
long jump.

<HEADLINE> Albright Says Punishment on Iraq Would Be Severe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright Sunday made clear that any military strike on Iraq would
be severe as a punishment for its not preventing U.N. weapons
inspectors from doing their work.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on CBS's "Face the Nation," Albright said that if the
United States decides to use military force to enforce U.N.
resolutions on weapons inspections, it would be "substantial
strike" aimed at diminishing Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's
ability to rebuild weapons of mass destruction and threaten his
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
She repeated that Saddam has only weeks to accede to a
diplomatic solution to avoid a U.S.-led attack.
</P>
<P>
Senate majority leader Trent Lott, speaking after Albright on
CBS, still insisted on removing Saddam from power.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not talking about assassination, but I'm talking about a
coherent long-term policy," Lott said.
</P>
<P>
But what Albright promised to lawmakers was a severe punishment
on Saddam, saying that "we have to be very clear about what we are
after."
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Bill Richardson Sunday
rejected Iraq's latest proposal to solve the inspections crisis.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's Ambassador to the United Nations Nizar Hamdoon said on
CNN's "late Edition" that a "good chance" remains of averting a
military showdown.
</P>
<P>
He offered a proposal under which representatives of the U.N.
Security Council, including the United States, would have 60 days
to inspect eight presidential sites to determine they were not
being used to hide weapons. "I don't see how Iraq could be asked
for more," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Richardson, also appearing on CNN, said the proposal was
unacceptable, that the access of U.N. weapons inspectors must be
total and unhindered. "What we are seeing is another compromise
that would permit them to obscure the fact that they are probably
building substantial weapons of mass destruction," he said.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Urges Arabs to Thwart US Military Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Iraq Sunday called for joint
Arab efforts against any possible U.S. military attack on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A tough Arab position will lessen the possibility of a
U.S. attack, Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan said the military threat by the U.S. is aimed at
overthrowing the Iraqi government rather than enforcing the
U.N. resolutions as Washington claims.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain, the only country that has
announced to join the possible military attack, view the Iraqi
government as one which poses threat to their interests in the
region.
</P>
<P>
If the U.S. and Britain want to secure their regional
interests, they should open dialogs with Iraq and stop interfering
in Iraq's internal affairs, he said, adding Iraq does not oppose
their interests in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The two countries unleashed the military threat as Baghdad
barred U.N. inspectors from searching presidential premises for
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan said the inspection of presidential palaces will damage
Iraq's sovereignty. He stressed that it is not included in the
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
He said the diplomatic efforts to peacefully resolve the crisis
are continuing.
</P>
<P>
He highlighted the Russian mediation efforts as a key way to
solve the crisis. But he did not elaborate on what Russians have
proposed.

<HEADLINE> US Defense Secretary Arrives in Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen arrived in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, Sunday night
starting an official visit to the Gulf region, reports reaching
here from the Saudi Red Sea coast city said.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Cohen is expected to meet with Saudi King
Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz and other Saudi officials to discuss the
U.S. position on using force against Iraq in case the current
diplomacy fail to solve the current Iraq-U.N. crisis over
weapons inspection, Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Cohen flew in Jeddah from Germany where he received German
support for U.S. military action against Iraq if the U.S. and
Britain decide to resort to the military option to force Iraq to
allow U.N. arms inspectors to continue their operations without
any condition.
</P>
<P>
He was reportedly said Sunday that the U.S. would not ask to
launch air strikes against Iraq from military bases in Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
"It's not my intent to make such a request because we don't
think it is necessary," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
His remarks seemed to reflect Saudi unwillingness to be used as
a base against an Arab neighbor.
</P>
<P>
Cohen's tour came amidst mounting possibility of a
U.S. military strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
So far, four aircraft carriers, three from the U.S. and one
from Britain, and more than 400 fighters, including eight F-117A
Stealth fighting bombers, have been deployed in the Gulf preparing
to carry out the operation.
</P>
<P>
U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Bill Richardson said in
an interview with CNN broadcast live Sunday that the U.S. has
already got full support from Kuwait and Bahrain to its military
strike on Iraq and it hopes to get the same support from Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, whose visit followed an earlier visit last week by
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, arrived in Saudi
Arabia to help shape the next U.S. move in the standoff with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats in Saudi Arabia believed that Cohen's tour was the
last chance for the Iraqi regime to decide whether to back down
from its previous position or face the military strike.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. insists on demanding Iraq to grant the U.N.
inspectors unconditional access to sensitive places suspected of
hiding weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, who is scheduled to fly to Kuwait Monday to hold talks
with Kuwait leaders on the current crisis, will also visit
Bahrain, Qatar, Oman and the United Arab Emirates in a bid to drum
up more Arab support to its possible military strike on Iraq.
