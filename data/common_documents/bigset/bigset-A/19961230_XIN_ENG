<HEADLINE> Arafat, Mubarak Meet on Hebron Stickers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat held an expanded
session of talks at the presidency headquarters here today when
sticking points still obstruct a deal on the partial Israeli
pullout from Hebron.
</P>
<P>
A team of senior Palestinian officials attended the meeting,
including Secretary of the PLO Executive Committee Mahmoud Abbas,
Minister of Planning and International Cooperation Nabil Shaath,
Minister of Local Government Saeb Erekat together with
Palestinian Ambassador here Zohdi al-Kuddrah and Arafat's advisor
Nabil Abu Redina.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival here this morning, Arafat said the
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations were facing difficulties.
</P>
<P>
"To overcome the difficulties, Egypt is exerting efforts and
the U.S. is giving a push," he added.
</P>
<P>
Describing the present situation as "quite sensitive and
critical," the Palestinian leader said it is necessary to come to
Egypt to brief Mubarak on the difficulties and to listen to his
advice.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to make peace with Israel, has
been a strong advocate of the Palestinian cause and a pillar in
the Mideast peace process initiated in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The difficulties, he said, involve the issues of "hot
pursuit," the type of arms, buffer zone, and the resumption of
negotiations over pending matters, mainly redeployment and final
phase negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader will brief Mubarak on the latest
developments of the negotiations with the Israeli side and the
differences prior to his meeting with Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai this evening, said Arafat's advisor Nabil Abu
Redina, who accompanied him on the trip, before departure from
Gaza early this morning.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is also expected to meet with Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu Monday to clear their remaining differences,
according to the latest news from Jerusalem. The two leaders met
in Erez check point last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators from both sides will resume talks this evening on
the long-overdue deal on the partial Israeli troop withdrawal
from the West Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Abbas said Saturday that the deal
could be expected "within three to four days" if security
concerns are cleared.
</P>
<P>
The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) official told a
press conference here that Egypt is not in a neutral position to
give guarantees for implementing the deal nor might it attend the
signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
He said the two sides have agreed on the security arrangements
in Hebron in general, the airport, and the opening of the Shohada
and Hesba roads for Palestinians, but there are still some points
of disagreement between them.
</P>
<P>
A deal on Hebron would be the first major progress in the
peace process since the new Israeli government took office in
June and would open the door for peace talks on the Lebanese and
Syrian tracks.
</P>
<P>
Under the autonomy accords, the Israeli troop redeployment
from 80 percent of Hebron should be completed last
March. Netanyahu insisted on better security for the 450 Jews
living among 200,000 Palestinians in the city.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Edges Shandong to Rise to 2nd Place </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai Oriental edged
Shandong Flaming Bulls 65-62 in Shanghai to rise to the second
place of the Chinese Men's Basketball First Division on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, entering Sunday's 10th round with seven wins and two
losses same as Shandong, rallied from a 4-0 deficit at the
beginning to lead 34-27 before the break.
</P>
<P>
Shandong staged a comeback in the second half and levelled the
score at 62-62 after hitting three consecutive three-pointers.
</P>
<P>
With 16 seconds remaining, a decisive lay-up by Liang Da put
Shanghai ahead and an ensuing free-throw sealed the host's
victory.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, with eight wins and two losses, now stands second on
the standings behind Army Rockets, which defeated Beijing Ducks in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yudong of Rockets hit 25 of his 30 points in the first half
of the 114-82 victory to maintain their lead with a nine-win and
one-loss record.
</P>
<P>
The Army Rockets, who lost their first game since October in
1993 to the Liaoning Hunters last Wednesday on the home court of
Xi'an, never faced the challenge and took a 58-39 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yudong also contributed eight rebounds in his 23 minutes
play for the defending champions, which extended the lead to
87-52, the larggest margin in the game, with 11 minutes left.
</P>
<P>
Liu Qiang added 22 points for the Army team, which had three
other players to score a double-figure pionts with Li Nan's 17,
Zhang Jingsong's 15 and Wang Sheng's 10.
</P>
<P>
Bateer led the Ducks with a game-high 32 points in his 40
minutes performance. Liu Hongwei scored 16 points for Beijing,
which had a 4-6 record to be a lowly 7th in the league.
</P>
<P>
Also on Sunday, Liaoning Hunters defeated Guangdong Tigers
84-78 in Dongguan, Guangdong Province, to place third in the
league, while Tigers were fourth.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Failed Parastatals Decree Causes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Some Nigerians may have fled
the country to escape trial under the yet-to-be-promulgated
failed parastatals decree designed to punish those responsible
for the failure of government enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The imminent decree may have also led some politicians to go
underground, the local newspaper Sunday Vanguard reported today,
but it did not give any details.
</P>
<P>
The decree is expected to be promulgated next month. It was
officially made public by the Head of State General Sani Abacha
in his October 1 independence broadcast.
</P>
<P>
Believed to have been put together by the Nigerian Economic
Intelligence Committee, the decree is aimed at punishing those
who have contributed one way or another to the collapse of some
government industries in the recent past.
</P>
<P>
The presidency has almost perfected the decree which may be
announced in next year's budget, said the paper, quoting a
committee source.
</P>
<P>
It is the hope of the Nigerian government that the decree will
help improve the performance of government enterprises because
the nation "needs a stong public sector for a private sector to
be effective", according to Sam Aluko, Head of the Nigerian
Economic Intelligence Committee.

<HEADLINE> UAE To Regulate Labor Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) will take new measures to regulate its market of immigrant
labors, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Saif al-Jarwan was quoted
as asking his offices concerned to prepare plans for inspections
of companies and plants where immigrants have been employed.
</P>
<P>
The labor inspection plan came at the end of an amnesty
announced by the Interior Ministry in early July, which allows
violators of the country's immigration and labor laws to leave
without being punished.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that labor inspectors would conduct checks on
companies and plants on whether expatriate workers are working
for their original sponsors and on labour conditions, working
hours and salaries.
</P>
<P>
Each company or plant would be inspected at least twice a
year. Surprise visits are also expected to be carried out during
day or night working hours, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has been crowded with cheap but often illegal Asian
expatriate workers. In a drive started in early July, more than
200,000 foreign labors have peen forced to leave this oil-rich
country.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Japan's Moderate Economic Recovery Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese economy has moved
out of a period of temporary slowdown and resumed a gradual upward
trend.
</P>
<P>
A recent government outlook said that the economy will continue
to recover in the immediate future, with its gross domestic
product (GDP) at a real 1.9 percent in fiscal 1997.
</P>
<P>
The projected growth is the lowest forecast ever but is still
higher than private-sector estimates and the projection by the
Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD). Most of Japan's private-sector economists put the figure
at below 1.5 percent and the OECD 1.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the outlook adopted by the cabinet of Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto earlier this month, the government said the GDP will
grow a nominal 3.1 percent in the year starting April 1.
</P>
<P>
During the latter half of fiscal 1996 ending March 31 and the
early fiscal 1997, the impetus provided thus far by government
spending will diminish, as additional funds allocated for
government investment are used up and private housing investment
peaks.
</P>
<P>
These factors will likely lead to a gradual rise in
deflationary pressures in the economy.
</P>
<P>
Forward indicators of government investment are already
beginning to deteriorate and, while demand for housing investment
is surging in advance of the scheduled increase in the consumption
tax, it is expected to reach a peak in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
For the remainder of fiscal 1996, the economy is expected to
continue its expansion supported by the following three main
factors: first, the trend toward self-sustained recovery in a
broad range of sectors; second, the surge in consumption and
private housing investment prior to the rise in the consumption
tax, and a decline in external deflationary pressures as the
weakening of the yen brings recovery in exports and a slowing of
import growth.
</P>
<P>
As a result, real GDP growth in fiscal 1996 is expected to
reach 2.9 percent, versus 2.2 percent in fiscal 1995, according to
a Sanwa Bank forecast.
</P>
<P>
The Hashimoto cabinet gives top priority to the sweeping reform
of the economic structure, fiscal spending, the financial system,
social welfare and the bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
Though the consumption tax hike is prompting consumers to spend
before April, the government foresees a real 1.5 percent increase
in fiscal 1997 consumer spending on slowly rising employee income.
</P>
<P>
Consumer prices are projected to rise 1.6 percent, of which 1.5
percentage points will come from the tax increase. Wholesale
prices are expected to climb 1.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Private-sector capital investment will likely gain a real 7.1
percent, with recovery spreading from major manufacturers to
smaller businesses and nonmanufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Housing investment is forecast to decline a real 4.9 percent,
swinging from an estimated 11.5 percent gain in fiscal 1996.
</P>
<P>
Employment will gradually improve in step with the economic
recovery, with the jobless rate sliding to around 3.3 percent from
an estimated 3.4 percent in fiscal 1996, according to the
government.

<HEADLINE> British Universities Preparing to Charge Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Some of Britain's top
universities are collectively preparing to demand fees of up to
1,000 pounds (about 1,600 U.S. dollars) each year from
undergraduates.
</P>
<P>
The 17 institutions, which make up what is known as the elite
Russel group of universities, are expected to announce that
students starting from 1998 may have to make a contribution
towards their fees by the end of their three-year courses, the
Sunday Times newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The vice-chancellors from the Russel group decided to issue the
warning on introducing charges to students after a meeting later
this month.
</P>
<P>
Universities considering ending free higher education include
Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle and
Imperial College and University of London in London.
</P>
<P>
Until now higher education fees have been paid by local
education authorities, which are reimbursed by the British
government.The new proposal stems from a financial squeeze created
by the Government's desire to increase the number of students in
higher education while reducing central funding.
</P>
<P>
In the current financial year, the Higher Education Funding
Council for England gave grants of 3.1 billion pounds (about 4.9
billion dollars) to 136 universities and colleges, a decrease of 4
million pounds (about 6 million dollars) from the 1995 grants.

<HEADLINE> Year-ender: World Moves Toward Multipolarization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Contrary to a big power's wish
to dominate the world, the planet in 1996 moved steadfastly toward
multipolarization, with all major forces busy adjusting
strategies and building up strength so as to find optimal places
for themselves.
</P>
<P>
The move toward multipolarization this year was first of all
characterized by the setbacks suffered by the United States, due
to the strong opposition of the international community, in its
attempt to build a "monopolar world" for the 21st century, which
would be dominated by only one superpower.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. took two major moves in the year to maintain and
reinforce its position as the one and only superpower in the
post-Cold War world.
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, it strengthened the traditional military
alliance with its allies in the East and in the West to prevent
the emergence of possible rivals in Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
In the East, it strengthened the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation
and Security with Japan by expanding the scope of bilateral
security cooperation to include the entire Asia-Pacific region. It
also reinforced military cooperation with Australia.
</P>
<P>
In the West, the U.S. worked hard to push the eastward
expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to
include the allies and some republics of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
On the other, the U.S. practiced hegemonism and power politics
throughout the world. Pursuing "unilateral interventionism," it
meddled in other countries' internal affairs under the pretext of
human rights, imposed economic and trade sanctions and launched
missile attacks on other countries.
</P>
<P>
With these hegemonist behaviors, the U.S. was condemned and
opposed by more and more countries, including its allies, leaving
itself in the most isolated position since 1990. This shows its
attempt to build a monopolar world is unpopular and the trend
toward multipolarization is irresistible.
</P>
<P>
Another feature of the world's move toward multipolarization
was that Europe, Japan and Russia showed a tendency for greater
independence and tried to become independent power centers in the
new world.
</P>
<P>
In order to become an equal to the U.S. in the 21st century,
the European Union went ahead with the integration process,
actively moved eastward and southward, and expanded its sphere of
influence in Asia, Africa and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the EU reinforced the "European pillar" inside
NATO this year and France openly demanded a sharing of NATO
command. Some Western European countries contended with the
U.S. for the leadership role in the affairs of Europe, the Middle
East and Africa, and the EU held the first-ever Asia-Europe summit
meeting in March with 10 Asian countries without the
U.S. participation.
</P>
<P>
Japan, while quickening its pace toward becoming a political
and military power, demonstrated somewhat independence from the
U.S. on issues such as the U.S. military bases in Japan, the
Korean Peninsula and bilateral trade, hoping to eventually get rid
of U.S. control and become an independent pole in international
affairs.

KAMPALA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Remnants of Allied Democratic
Forces (ADF) rebels have killed three people while terrorizing
villagers in Kasese district, southwestern Uganda.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here today said hundreds of people left
their villages and went to towns on Friday where government
soldiers have detachments.
</P>
<P>
The fleeing civilians were quoted as saying rebels attacked
the area at about 9:00 p.m. that day and also stole goats,
chickens and dried beans, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people have also been displaced following the
incidents in the area, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Security officials were quoted as saying that government
troops immediately pursued the rebels after the incidents.

<HEADLINE> Year-ender: World Moves Toward Multipolarization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Russia has been openly against the creation of a "monopolar
world." To this end, it opposed NATO's eastward expansion,
strengthened security cooperation with other republics of the
former Soviet Union and established a 21st century-oriented
strategic partnership with China.
</P>
<P>
Russia also pursued a flexible diplomacy in the Middle East,
Bosnia and other hot-spot areas, trying to provide a
counter-balance against Western countries. Meanwhile, Russia was
also developing its economy and envisaging military reforms so
that it could become a big power in the 21st century which would
stand on an equal footing with the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The third feature of the trend toward multipolarization was
that the developing countries were growing in strength and have
proved themselves to be a major force in international arena.
</P>
<P>
At the United Nations conference on human rights this year, the
developing countries joined forces and once again defeated the
attempt of Western nations to use human rights as a pretext to
interfere in the internatal affairs of other countries.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Assembly in November adopted a resolution with an
overwhelming majority, demanding that the U.S. lift its
30-year-long blockade against Cuba. Only the U.S. and two other
countries voted against the resolution.
</P>
<P>
The "backyard" of the U.S. was also on fire. At a meeting of
the Organization of American States in June, Latin American
countries passed a resolution rejecting the U.S. Helms-Burton law
which would punish the countries that maintain trade and economic
links with Cuba. This was something unprecedented in the
organization's 100 year history.
</P>
<P>
All this has shown that in the post-Cold War era, the
developing countries as a whole have become stronger both
economically and politically. They have become an important force
in pushing the world toward multipolarization.
</P>
<P>
The fourth feature of the course of multipolarization was the
sustained growth of the world economy, the economic globalization
and regionalization, and the economic pluralization.
</P>
<P>
This year, the world economy grew 3.8 percent, a record in
eight years. The world's three economic centers -- Western
Europe, North America and East Asia -- have grown in strength.
The five largest economies -- the U.S., Japan, Germany, China and
Russia -- were developing steadily. Subregional economic blocs
were flourishing in Southeast Asia, Latin America, Africa and the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
These economic forces have interwoven with each other at the
national, regional and global levels, promoting inter-dependence
and mutual penetration. They have provided a material foundation
and a driving force for the world's political multipolarization.
</P>
<P>
It will take a considerably long time before multipolarization
is completed. Throughout this process, there will be struggles
between domination and multipolarization, hegemonism and
anti-hegemonism, containment and anti-containment, control and
anti-control. These struggles could lead to regional conflicts,
tumults and even wars.
</P>
<P>
But multipolarization is an irresistible trend, which will lead
to a politically and economically more balanced world, thus
promoting the world peace and development into the 21st century.

HARARE, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The opposition Zimbabwe
Congress Party today said the government should take measures to

and corruption which brought suffering to Zimbabweans in 1996.
</P>

In a statement, the party's President Kenneth Mano said
Zimbabweans in 1996 faced a number of hardships due to price

strikes by medical personnel.
</P>

"Therefore, 1997 should be a year of coming up with
constructive ideas which can improve our livelihood," Mano said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Pay Better Price for Quality Coffee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The Coffee and Tea
Authority of Ethiopia announced today that it has plans to pay
coffee growers better price for quality item supplied to the
market.
</P>
<P>
Authority General Manager Isegaye Dirhane said farmers could
benefit from the sale of the cash crop picked at the right time,
avoiding the gathering of unripe, green beans.
</P>
<P>
Farmers as well as dealers engaged in coffee trade should pay
due attention to the quality and timely supply of the item to
come out winners and beneficiaries in the world market where the
number of exporter countries is increasing from time to time, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The authority, he said, has started supervision of coffee
supplied to the central market and at times sifts produce which
lacks quality even after the dispatch of the item from regions
with approvals for its quality.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will be made to raise the quality of coffee ready for
export if it fails to meet the standard, he added.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia is one of the major coffee producers and exporters in
the world. Coffee shares more than 50 percent of Ethiopia's
export, and 25 percent of the country's population are engaged in
coffee production, trade or related activities and it is the
source for 10 percent of government's revenue.
</P>
<P>
The decline in coffee price on the world market reduced the
earning of Ethiopia from coffee export last year.

LONDON, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The British Government
announced here today that it is planning to use a floating prison
ship to house hundreds of convicts in an effort to ease the
worsening overcrowding in conventional jails.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an interview with the Independent Television News
earlier today, Britain's Home Office minister Anne Widdecombe said
that the jail ship named Resolution, which is to be moored off the
south coast port of Portland, is expected to house up to 500
prisoners from next month.
</P>
<P>
British prison services are facing ever increasing overcrowding
problems as the country's prison population has amounted to some
59,000.
</P>
<P>
Widdecombe rejected criticism from prison reformers that the
introduction of floating prisons was a throwback to the prison
"hulks" of the Victorian times.
</P>
<P>
"I have seen some rather stupid comparisons in the press today
with the hulks. It's nothing like that at all," she said.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that the ship prison was "modern" with a gymnasium
and "it has all the things that we could expect an ordinary prison
to have."

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Reiterates Commitment to Mission in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping
force known as ECOMOG will remain committed to its mission in
Liberia and do all it can to facilitate the successful
implementation of disarmament of the Liberian warring factions.
</P>
<P>
According to Major-General Victor Malu, the force commander,
the ECOMOG will continue to take steps to eliminate anything that
would impede the success of the disarmament process, the News
Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
During a recent meeting in Monrovia, capital of Liberia, with
the new chief military observer of the U.N. Observers Mission in
Liberia, Malu noted that the peacekeeping force was dispatched to
the war-torn nation when the intensity of the killings became
intolerable and had no bearing to any objective of the fighters.
</P>
<P>
Before the ECOMOG's arrival, embassies of countries were
ransacked while Liberians in such embassies were brutally killed
to the extent that some of the embassies are yet to re-open
today.
</P>
<P>
He said the Liberian crisis has also posed danger to the whole
of the west African sub-region as it had the potential of
affecting the entire west African countries.
</P>
<P>
Since the civil war broke out in 1989, more than 150,000
people have been killed, leaving even more Liberians displaced or
as refugees in neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
As a result of efforts by the sub-region and the entire
international community, warring factions have agreed to cease
fire and more than 4,000 fighters have been disarmed since the
disarmament process began on November 22 this year.
</P>
<P>
The disarmament exercise will be completed at the end of
January next year and election of a new civilian government is
scheduled for May.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Failed Parastatals Decree Causes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Some Nigerians may have fled
the country to escape trial under the yet-to-be-promulgated
failed parastatals decree designed to punish those responsible
for the failure of government enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The imminent decree may have also led some politicians to go
underground, the local newspaper Sunday Vanguard reported today,
but it did not give any details.
</P>
<P>
The decree is expected to be promulgated next month. It was
officially made public by head of state General Sani Abacha in
his October 1 Independence broadcast.
</P>
<P>
Believed to have been put together by the Nigerian Economic
Intelligence Committee, the decree is aimed at punishing those
who have contributed one way or the other to the collapse of some
government industries in the recent past.
</P>
<P>
The presidency has almost perfected the decree which may be
announced in next year's budget, the paper said, quoted a
committee source.
</P>
<P>
It is the hope of the Nigerian government that the decree will
help improve the performance of government enterprises because
the nation "needs a strong public sector for a private sector to
be effective", according to Sam Aluko, head of the committee.

DAR ES SALAAM, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Repatriation of Rwandan
refugees from camps in Ngara and Karagwe districts of Kagera
region in north-western Tanzania, has been completed, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, over 500,000 refugees have been
handed over to Rwanda since the exercise started on December 14
this year and ended on Saturday when the last group of Rwandan
refugees crossed the Rusomo border post.
</P>
<P>
Government sources told the official Daily News in Ngara today
that an estimated 1,300 refugees could be still hiding in the
bush both in Karagwe and Ngara and pointed out that some hide
outs have already been identified by helicopter.

The government has declared that it is going to conduct a
house-to-house search after completion of the major operation to
ensure that all refugees are repatriated.

<HEADLINE> Hebron Talks Continue to Clear Remaining Obstacles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators continued talks here today on removing the last
obstacles blocking a deal on Israeli troop redeployment in
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian negotiator Jamil Tarifi said that difference on a
number of civil and security issues remained after today's
negotiations, which were held at a Jerusalem hotel. But he
meanwhile expressed the hope that an agreement could be reached
by Wednesday before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Amid reports of signing the Hebron deal within the week,
Palestinian Authority (PA) President Yasser Arafat is to meet
with Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai late tonight in a
bid to iron out all the remaining obstacles.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is visiting Egypt today to hold consultations with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on the Hebron talks. Israel
Radio reported that Mordechai today telephoned Mubarak to urge
him to use his influence on Arafat to help close the Hebron
talks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials said that after recent intensive
negotiations and the U.S. mediation, a Hebron deal was nearing
completion. But they added that some issues remained to be
resolved, especially on the security arrangements in the areas
close to the Tomb of Patriarchs, the shrine holy to both Jews
and Moslems.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is reportedly requesting conducting joint police patrols
at the Tomb of Patriarchs in Hebron, but Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu today firmly refused to accept this demand.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Jewish students this morning, Netanyahu said that
Israeli troops would maintain "complete control" over the Tomb
of Patriarchs and that Jewish presence in Hebron would be
preserved forever.
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who tells you that we are leaving Hebron, he is
telling you a lie. We are there and we are going to stay
forever, for all time," Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Netanyahu said that he believed the
imminent Hebron deal would bring about more stability and
greater Israeli-Palestinian cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"We have arrived at security arrangements that I believe will
bring about more security, more stability ... and automatically
more cooperation between the Palestinians and Israelis in that
city (Hebron)," Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
The situation remained tense in Hebron pending the upcoming
Israeli redeployment. Two Molotov petrol bombs were thrown today
at Israeli troop outposts in the city, leading to the arrest of
several Palestinian suspects by Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian car was set on fire near a Jewish neighborhood,
but no clash was reported between the militant Jewish settlers
and Palestinian residents.

<HEADLINE> Israel Cancels Tel Aviv-Cairo Bus Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Israel's main public
transportation firm, Egged, ended today its regular service
between Tel Aviv and the Egyptian capital of Cairo, due to lack
of passengers.
</P>
<P>
According to an Israel Radio report, the firm lost 3,000
shekels (some 1,000 U.S. dollars) every time when a bus made the
12-hour Tel Aviv-Cairo trip, with only about 10 riders.
</P>
<P>
"The main reason is economic," Egged spokesman Ron Ratner
said. "In the last two years we have seen a steady decline in
passengers on a line that is expensive to run."
</P>
<P>
"There are simply less interest today (among Israelis) in
Egypt," he added.
</P>
<P>
The last Egged bus to Cairo left Tel Aviv today and will
return Monday, Ratner said, leaving Israelis with the
alternatives of flying or taking a chartered bus to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
However, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, who
visited Egypt last week at the invitation of Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak, Friday called on Transportation Minister Yitzhak
Levy to act to stop the cancellation of the bus line.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai said the Tel Aviv-Cairo bus line is an expression
of peace between the two countries and a sign of normalization,
stressing that the peace with Egypt is strategic and each country
must make efforts to preserve and nurture it.
</P>
<P>
"The operation of the Tel Aviv-Cairo line is important, even
if the government will have to help Egged to maintain it due to
the small number of passengers," Mordechai said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
However, Ratner said the government turned down Egged's
request to subsidize the line, which was inaugurated in 1982,
three years after Israel and Egypt signed a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Israelis traveled on the line every week during
the 1980s, but Egged cut its service in recent years to just once
a week due to the decrease in passengers.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Welcomes Russian Role in Solving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government
welcomed Russian active involvement in efforts for a solution to
the Cyprus problem, the Cyprus News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides was quoted as
saying that Russia has played a significant role as a permanent
member of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
President Glafcos Clerides will convey, through the island's
left-wing Akel Party General Secretary Demetris Christofias,
specific proposals on solving the Cyprus problem to the Russian
government, Cassoulides said, adding that there is possibility of
an official invitation to Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeni
Primakov to visit the island.
</P>
<P>
He also reaffirmed the government's wish for a coordinated
effort by the five permanent U.N. Security Council members
towards a Cyprus settlement.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a spokesman for Akel Party has announced that
Christofias will travel to Moscow as a special envoy of President
Clerides to deliver a message to Russian Foreign Minister
Primakov on January 9.
</P>
<P>
The message is a reply to a letter sent by Primakov to
Clerides in October.
</P>
<P>
Russia has reportedly called for an immediate meeting between
the five permanent members of the Security Council and European
Union (EU) representatives to discuss practical ways to solve the
Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey sent troops
and seized the northern third of the island following a
short-lived coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-sponsored peace efforts have been going on for the
past 22 years, but so far no tangible results have been
achieved.

<HEADLINE> Upbeat Economy Does not Lesson Job Worries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 29 (Xinhua) -- A growing number of Americans
believe the U.S. economy is in good shape. But the number
concerned about their own jobs has not changed significantly in
the last year.
</P>
<P>
The New York Tims today quoted figures of the Labor Department
to demonstrate the trend. The government figures show that the
number of people laid off in 1995, the most recent year for which
government data are available, rose to 3.47 million, nearly the
peak reached in 1992, right after the last recession. Through
November of this year, even after more than five years of economic
recovery, the number of layoffs announced by companies had
increased 14 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Even as unemployment was extremely low, and with millions more
jobs created than were wiped out, people still have an anxiety for
their job security, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The new findings by the paper confirm that layoffs have become
a durable fixture of today's economy, occurring steadily in good
times and bad.
</P>
<P>
Three-quarters of all American households have seen a family
members, friend, relative or neighbor lose job since 1980.
</P>
<P>
In a poll by The New York Times earlier this month, 67 percent
rated the condition of the economy as fairly good or very good.
That was up from 51 percent in a similar poll conducted last
December.
</P>
<P>
Despite the improvement, economic insecurity persists at
virtually the level of a year ago, according to the new poll.
</P>
<P>
According to researchers, 10.1 million people were laid off
from 1993 through 1995 versus 6.7 million in 1987-89.
</P>
<P>
Economists also said that a fast-moving economy has created far
more jobs than it has destroyed in recent years. Since early 1992,
America has generated 12.3 million net new jobs. In 1995, the
number of new jobs created has outnumbered the ones wiped out at a
rate of 208,000 a month, leaving the country with much lower
unemployment rate than many countries in Europe.
</P>
<P>
However, of the workers laid off, only about a third could make
as much as or more than in their previous jobs. The rest were
working part time, were self-employed or were working full time
for less money than before, according to the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Damascus Declaration Group Meeting Calls for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of the
Damascus Declaration group ended here today their two-day meeting
 by approving a document, calling for security and stability in
the region and closer pan-Arab cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The document approved by the foreign ministers of Egypt, Syria
and the six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council -- Saudi
Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman
-- dealt with the latest developments in the Gulf, the Mideast
peace process and a joint Arab action framework, the Egyptian
Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Convened at a time of mounting tensions in the region, the
14th Damascus Declaration meeting reviewed Arab differences and
underscored the importance of respecting the sovereignty of Arab
countries.
</P>
<P>
The document released at the closing session condemned all
forms of terrorism and urged immediate measures against any
aggressions.
</P>
<P>
It voiced support for the UAE sovereignty over the three
islands of Greater and Lesser Tunbs and Abu Musa, over which the
UAE has a bitter dispute with Iran.
</P>
<P>
The meeting decided that the quadrilateral mediation committee
grouping the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait
and Oman would meet later in a bid to narrow the gap between
Bahrain and Qatar over a territorial dispute.
</P>
<P>
The document also welcomed developments in Iraq after the
execution of U.N. Security Council resolution 986 on the
oil-for-food deal, which was arranged as a partial lifting of the
international embargo imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the document urged Israel to keep its commitment to
peace and return occupied Arab land. Full normalization and
cooperation between the Arabs and Israel could only be realized
on Israel's abidance by the Madrid peace framework, said the
document.
</P>
<P>
It appealed to the Arab community to coordinate and unify
their actions in face of the Israeli intransigence and practices
detrimental to peace.
</P>
<P>
It called for adherence to the resolutions adopted by the
Cairo Arab summit held in June, which lent weight to underpinning
inter-Arab solidarity, establishing overall and just peace and
resuming peace overtures on all tracks in accordance with the
land-for-peace formula.
</P>
<P>
The document also called for enhancing economic, political and
security cooperation within the eight-member alliance and
reactivating the Arab League.
</P>
<P>
Damascus Declaration signatories have agreed to consolidate
the framework of joint Arab action, primarily enhancing economic
and technological ties to further their development.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also followed up on a number of economic
projects, previously approved in principle during the 13th
session held in the Omani capital of Muscat.
</P>
<P>
The Damascus Declaration, signed in the Syrian capital
following the 1991 Gulf war, calls for joint security and
military arrangements in addition to economic cooperation among
the eight signatories.

PARIS, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The cold snap which descended
last week on France and other European countries claimed its
seventh victim Saturday night, as the temperature dropped to its
lowest in 30 years in the northeastern part of the country.
</P>

Charles Ziegler, a homeless man of 65 years old, died Saturday
night of hypothermia in a church house in Sarre-Union, Bas-Rhin in

<P>
A 29-year-old woman miraculously survived after she was found

dropped to 29 degrees.
</P>
<P>
The average temperature of northeast France dropped to minus 16
degrees centigrade Saturday night, with Strasbourg froze in minus
15 degrees, two degrees lower than the record cold registered on
December 28, 1962.
</P>
<P>
In Paris and its suburbs, the thermometer stayed from minus
eight to minus 10 degrees centigrade, against minus 11 to minus 14
degrees registered on December 28, 1962.

The southern city of Toulouse had the coldest day since 1947
Saturday with minus three to minus six degrees.
</P>

The Mediterranean island of Corsica had its first snow in 10
years, where the ceiling of a supermarket near Bastia collapsed
due to the weight of the snow, and electricities were cut in
several places by the snowfall.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Expects Most Refugees to Return Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 29 (Xinhua) -- With peace and stability
being firmly established in Bosnia, more and more refugees in
Yugoslavia would be ready to go back to Bosnia in 1997, a Serbian
refugee official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Bratislava Morina, President of the Serbian Refugees
Commission, said the commission planned to sign a memorandum with
Bosnian Serb entity Republka Srpska in January to facilitate the
return of refugees.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum would be coordinated with a plan of the U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and set a two-year period
to complete the return of refugees, Morina said in a statement to
Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia has housed more than 600,000 refugees fleeing from
Bosnia and Croatia from 1991 to 1995, which was a heavy burden to
Belgrade both economically and socially.
</P>
<P>
Due to unwillingness of political leaders in Bosnia and
Croatia, the repatriation process has been going on rather slowly.
UNHCR Belgrade Bureau has said it has managed to send back about
1,000 refugees back to Bosnia and Croatia this year.
</P>
<P>
Morina said she expected more refugees would like to go back to
their homes in Bosnia and Croatia now than six month ago, when
only 49.2 percent said at that time they wished for a
repatriation.
</P>
<P>
More refugees would opt for a return with the stable peace and
political circumstances in Bosnia, and normalization of relations
between Yugoslavia and Croatia.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia normalized relations with Croatia in August of this
year and gained a mutual recognition with Bosnia two month later,
thus paving a way for a safe repatriation of refugees from
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"Yugoslavia wants to solve the problem of about 600,000
refugees permanently," the refugee official said, adding the
memorandum would specify principles for the return of refugees,
specifically for the first 50,000 returning to Republika Srpska.
</P>
<P>
Morina noted that Yugoslavia, which comprises of Serbia and
Montenegro, was exhausted after the four-year U.N. sanctions, and
was unable to provide a permanent solution to so many refugees,
the more so as international humanitarian organizations had not
provided funds for such a solution.
</P>
<P>
Fearing possible conflicts in the future or with their houses
under the former enemy's territories, many refugees have chosen to
stay in Yugoslavia and be reintegrated into local community
gradually, according to investigation of UNHCR officials based in
Belgrade.

<HEADLINE> Cafe Explosion Wounds 20 Algerians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 29 (Xinhua) -- At least 20 Algerian citizens
were wounded, some seriously, in an explosion at a cafe at about
10:30 a.m. (10:30 GMT) today in the southeast Algiers suburb of
El Harrac, according to media reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
So far, no organization has claimed responsibility for the
attack.
</P>
<P>
A statement to this effect was released today by the Algerian
Public Security Administration.
</P>
<P>
The Administration did not say whether the explosion was
caused by a booby trapped car or a time bomb, although the latter
possibility is more probable as it took place inside the cafe.
</P>
<P>
Algeria witnessed over the past week several explosions. On
December 21 and 22 three explosions had taken place in downtown
Algiers, the capital, killing and wounding a number of civilians.
</P>
<P>
On December 24, five Algerian citizens died and 15 others
injured by the explosion of a booby trapped car in the town of
Bleida, some 50 kilometers south of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Again on December 25, a bomb exploded in the capital city
killing one Algerian citizen and wounding 13 others of whom 6

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Hashimoto to Tackle Reform, Security in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
faces a tough time when the Japanese Diet (parliament) convenes in
late January, with the leading opposition New Frontier Party (NFP)
 likely to pounce on his cabinet over a series of bureaucratic
scandals.
</P>
<P>
Whether Hashimoto, who heads a minority government formed
exclusively by his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), will survive
all the challenges remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
The LDP made some gains in the October 20 election for the
House of Representatives, but does not have a majority in both
houses of parliament. It must rely on its two smaller political
allies -- the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and new Party Sakigake
-- for support.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto has vowed to undertake sweeping reforms in five
fields -- administration, economic structure, the financial
system, social security structure and the budgetary system.
</P>
<P>
His promise to realign Japan's 22 government ministries and
agencies to streamline Japan's bureaucracy by the start of 2001
will start with reform of the powerful Finance Ministry, following
the ministry's poor handling of the massive bad loans scandal
involving housing loan firms, widely known as "jusen."
</P>
<P>
The LDP, the SDP and Sakigake, which worked out a Finance
Ministry reform plan earlier this year, hope a bill on their
reform blueprint will be discussed during the upcoming Diet
session.
</P>
<P>
Although talk of carrying out administrative reform is
conducted in loud tones in the nation, cozy relations among
politicians, bureaucrats and the business community remain
uncorrected.
</P>
<P>
Apart from being beset by knotty domestic issues, the Peru
hostage crisis is posing severe test of leadership for Hashimoto.
</P>
<P>
With more than 80 people still being held hostage in the
Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima, crisis management has
been added to the list of priority tasks Hashimoto must address
during his second term in office.
</P>
<P>
By autumn 1997, Japan will complete a review of guidelines for
action by the nation's armed forces in cooperation with the U.S.
"in case of emergency" in the East Asian region.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto must also weigh up the political and diplomatic
fallout from his decision -- by next summer -- whether to accept a
U.S. proposal to jointly develop an advanced antimissile system
for "Theater Missile Defense."
</P>
<P>
The issue of strengthened military cooperation with the United
States, which goes to the heart of a decades-long constitutional
debate over the use of the armed forces, goes in tandem with the
political hot potato Hashimoto must grapple with over
U.S. military bases in Okinawa Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Although Hashimoto has managed to ease Okinawa's objections to
the huge U.S. military presence in the prefecture, the bases issue
is hardly over.
</P>
<P>
The Hashimoto administration must select a site in the
prefecture to relocate a heliport used by U.S. marines at the
Futumma Air Station, one of the military installations in Okinawa
the U.S. government has promised to return to Japan.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Keen on Activating Financial Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul
Karim Kabariti stressed here today that Jordan was keen to
activate the Amman financial market (AFM), the local press
reported.
</P>
<P>
The role of the AFM would be energized after the government
endorsed a package of economic legislation related to companies,
banknotes, customs and the rights of intellectual properties,
Kabariti said.
</P>
<P>
Those important issues would be discussed in the current
parliamentary session, said the prime minister while addressing
the visitors to AFM.
</P>
<P>
Laws would play positive and effective role in developing
Jordan's national economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to a study, the AFM is poised to be one of the
cheapest stock exchanges in the world next year.
</P>
<P>
This is due to the expected improvement in the performance of
the large companies by no less than 25 percent rise from that in
1996, the study said. The improvement resulted from the
endorsement of a new package of economic laws, especially those
about lower income taxes.

Tsang Hin Chi said that the Garrison Law not only guarantees
that Hong Kong will be safe from foreign invasion, but will also
help maintain Hong Kong's security and stability.
</P>
<P>
He said that PLA troops stationed in Hong Kong are a symbol of
China's sovereignty, and that the Garrison Law is very important
for the region.
</P>
<P>
It is only with a stable Hong Kong, that the region can have a
prosperous economy and its people can live and work in peace, he

stationed in Hong Kong, and it will help them carry out their
defence duties.

Pointing out that the expenditures of the British army in Hong
Kong are borne by the people of Hong Kong, while those of the PLA
in Hong Kong will be covered by the Central People's Government,
Tsang said this policy shows consideration for the people of
Hong Kong, and they are quite satisfied with it.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said he had visited the troops to be stationed in the
Hong Kong SAR, in Shenzhen, stressing that the troops are
well-trained and amiable with strict disciplines. "With such good
troops stationed in Hong Kong, and with the systematic Garrison
Law that fits Hong Kong's reality, the people of Hong Kong can
rest assured," he added.

<HEADLINE> China Opts For Market-Oriented Financial Leverage In 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- China made a giant step down
the road of macro-economic controls this year by resorting to
market-oriented leverage like interest rates, and is expected to
do more next year.
</P>
<P>
"In terms of macro-economic financial controls, I must say that
1996 has been a year when the country took a series of steps to
shift policy to indirect market-driven means from direct means
like administrative orders," said an official of the People's Bank
of China (PBC), the central bank.
</P>
<P>
This year, China's effort to use so-called indirect means for
macro-economic financial controls started with boosting the bill
re-discounting business with the Bill Law on January 1. The bill
discounted and re-discounted reached a total of 195.5 billion yuan
(about 23.5 billion US dollars) and 116 billion yuan,
respectively, between January and November.
</P>
<P>
Bill re-discounting has played a positive role not only in
curbing the note issuing growth, but in improving the distribution
of bank credit and improving the industrial structure, Li Yang,
director of the Finance Research Center of the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences, told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
Other indirect financial controls China adopted this year
included starting market operations in treasury bonds on April 9,
cutting interest rates on bank deposits on May 1 and August 23,
using an asset-to-liability management mode to replace the
prevailing credit quota system in commercial banks on a trial
basis, withdrawing the central bank's discount loans to commercial
banks to offset the inflationary pressures caused by
rapidly-growing foreign exchange reserves, and other measures.
</P>
<P>
"The traditional macro-economic financial control mechanism
cannot cope with the development needs of a market economy in
China," said Tao Liming, deputy director of the International
Finance Research Institute of the Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
Economic restructuring and the difficulties that the central
bank has met with in financial controls since China began its
reform and opening-up policy in the late 1970s have prompted China
to look more for indirect means than for direct means, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The central bank's active and flexible use of indirect
macro-economic financial controls like interest rates and open
market operations has successfully limited the money supply and
guaranteed stable growth in the national economy by avoiding an
excessive tightening or loosening of the credit supply," Tao
noted, saying that the effect of administrative controls on credit
under a planned economy was very poor.
</P>
<P>
"A common scenario at that time was that 'rigor mortise' used to
set in when the credit supply was tightened and chaos followed
when it was loosened," Tao sai, "and ultimately, there were wild
ups and downs in economic growth."
</P>
<P>
The increased use of indirect financial controls can help
accelerate China's pace of opening its financial sector to foreign
competition, he said.
</P>
<P>
It also indicates that the PBC's ability to formulate and
implement monetary policies independently has improved and that
its status as a central bank has been increased, both experts said.
</P>
<P>
In another move to exercise macro-economic financial controls
with market-based leverage, the PBC is expected to cut the reserve
ratio for commercial banks in the first half of next year.

Zhou Nan said that, according to the provisions of the Basic
Law, the Chinese government will implement the principles of "one
country, two systems", "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and
high degree of autonomy in Hong Kong after 1997.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he said, the central government will be
responsible for Hong Kong's defense and foreign affairs. It has
always been cautious and earnest about formulating the law and
acts in strict accordance with the principled stipulations
prescribed in the Basic Law on stationing troops in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that the entire process of drafting the law
symbolizes the principle of safeguarding state sovereignty and
brings democracy into full play.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the difference between the Garrison Law for
the Hong Kong SAR and that for the British army, Zhou said that
the biggest difference is that expenditures of the British army
are paid for by Hong Kong residents while those of the PLA in Hong
Kong are the responsibility of the central government.
</P>
<P>
"I am certain that the PLA troops will study every provision of
the law, and Hong Kong residents are welcome to cooperate with
the troops and seeing that their actions are in accordance with
the law," he said.

<HEADLINE> HK to Bid for '99 Short-course World Swimming Champ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Obviously inspired by its
success of staging the World Cup short-course swimming meet for
the last three years, Hong Kong has officially applied for hosting
the 1999 World Short-course Swimming Championships.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held here Monday for Epson Swimming World
 Cup Hong Kong '97, which is the opening leg of the eight-leg
World Cup series next year, officials of the Hong Kong Amateur
Swimming Association (HKASA) said the association had faxed
necessary documents to FINA, the sport's world governing body.
</P>
<P>
A. de O. Sales, president of the HKASA, said that the Kowloon
Park Indoor Swimming Pool, site of the World Cup competitions
here, has witnessed two new world records and other world-class
performance. "This proved that this is really a fast pool," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed the HKASA had decided to bid for the '99 world
short-course championships.
</P>
<P>
Ronnie Wong, secretary of the HKASA, said the association's
ability had been proved by its successful hosting of the World Cup
meets in the past.
</P>
<P>
The '97 World Cup meet here next month would provide one more
chance to prove that Hong Kong is suitable to stage world
championships, he said.
</P>
<P>
But Wong admitted that Hong Kong has a 50-50 chance to succeed
in the bid. Among other bidders are cities of Britain, Canada and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
Wong said that if Hong Kong is given the right, the world
championships will be held in the Kowloon Park Indoor Swimming
Pool. But the spectators' stand shall be expanded to 3,500 seats
from the current 1,700, he said.
</P>
<P>
To bid for a short-course, instead of a long-course or
Olympic-standard, world championships is more practical and
realistic at present for Hong Kong, Wong said.

<HEADLINE> China Taking Steps To Open Its Financial Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and foreign financiers
welcomed the central bank's decision today to allow overseas bank
branches to deal in Renminbi yuan, calling it a substantial move
in opening up its banking sector.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai branch of the People's Bank of China (PBC)
announced that Citibank, the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp.,
the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, and the Industrial Bank of Japan
have been given approval by the head office of China's central
bank to move their Shanghai branch offices to the city's Pudong
New Area and to deal in the local currency on a trial basis.
</P>
<P>
"Allowing foreign banks to do business in Renminbi yuan marks a
major step in the country's effort to open its financial sector to
overseas competition," a PBC Shanghai official noted.
</P>
<P>
The four banks' new business in yuan includes accepting
deposits, extending loans, providing guarantees, and investing in
Chinese treasury bonds and financial bonds, according to today's
announcement.
</P>
<P>
Henry Luo, assistant to the president of Citibank's Shanghai
branch, told Xinhua that the latest move "indicates that Shanghai
is taking one substantive step closer to its ambition of being an
international finance center."
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the two major efforts China has made this year
to open its financial sector wider," Luo said, referring to the
earlier move of making the yuan convertible this month.
</P>
<P>
As China allows overseas banks to deal in yuan, it will
withdraw its preferential treatment of them, such as tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
"In this sense, I must say that being allowed to do yuan
business is both an opportunity and a challenge to us," Luo said.
</P>
<P>
Li Yang, director of the Finance Research Center of the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences, told Xinhua that the latest move
demonstrates that China's economic and financial situation is
stable, and "in some sense, it's the real beginning of China's
financial market opening to the rest of the world."
</P>
<P>
He urged Chinese banks, especially state-owned ones, to improve
their operations in order to stand firm against growing financial
competition.
</P>
<P>
"Competition between Chinese and overseas financial
institutions will become more intense and our banks must improve
themselves," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ever since Hong Kong's Nanyang Commercial Bank became the first
overseas bank to set up a Chinese branch in Shenzhen in 1981, the
number of overseas financial banking institutions has grown fast -
by August, there were 137 overseas bank branches in 17 Chinese
cities.
</P>
<P>
If they don't have approval from China's central bank, the
branch banks are restricted to foreign-exchange business only, and
clients are confined to foreign-funded enterprises in China,
people from overseas, or those from Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
On July 1, overseas branch banks were allowed to trade in
foreign exchange with overseas-funded enterprises for the first
time.

<P>
Wang Shuwen, vice-chairman of the Law Committee of the National
People's Congress, said that the Garrison Law says that troops
stationed in the Hong Kong SAR must abide by national laws and the
laws of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
In the process of drawing up the law, the troops' duties, their
relationship with the SAR government, and jurisdiction over
military personnel were considered extensively, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
He said the troops stationed in the Hong Kong SAR are to help
maintain state sovereignty, national unity, territorial integrity,
and Hong Kong's security, and they must respect Hong Kong's social
system, Hong Kong people's lifestyle, and power organs of the Hong
Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
This is very important for their carrying on the fine
traditions of the PLA and for getting along with the people of
Hong Kong, he explained.
</P>
<P>
As for their relationship with the SAR government, he said the
garrison law stresses that they cannot interfere in local affairs,
but that the Hong Kong SAR government will support the troops
doing their duties.
</P>
<P>
The Garrison Law clearly explains jurisdiction over military
personnel, he said. The military judicial authorities on the
mainland will be in charge of criminal cases involving military
personnel on duty, while the Hong Kong SAR courts will have
jurisdiction over cases involving military personnel off duty.
</P>
<P>
In this way, the autonomy and jurisdiction of Hong Kong are
fully respected, and the legitimate rights of Hong Kong residents
are protected.

smooth transition, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
In referring to how the SAR government will be formed, Lu said
that, according to the Basic Law, principal officials of the SAR
will be nominated by the Chief Executive, who will report on this
to the Central People's Government for approval.
</P>
<P>
These principal officials will shoulder the historic task of
helping with a smooth transition and building a prosperous Hong
Kong, he said, noting that they must pledge their loyalty to the
Hong Kong SAR government of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
This reflects the principle of "Hong Kong people governing Hong
Kong" and the high-degree autonomy, he added, saying that it is up
to the Chief Executive to consider forming the SAR government, and
the central government has full faith in this.
</P>
<P>
The central government places great hopes in the HK SAR
government-designate and is convinced that, with the support of
the people of Hong Kong, they will provide a new historical
chapter for the Hong Kong SAR, he said.

When asked about the obstacles the Preparatory Committee has
met in its preparations for the Hong Kong SAR, Lu said the work
was unprecedented and full of challenges, and "needs the joint
creative efforts of all of us," and that there are still various
interferences and troubles.
</P>
<P>
"Some persons have different views about establishing the
Provisional Legislative Council and attempted to impose pressure
on us using international force," he said, but that no one can
stop the advancement of history.
</P>
<P>
In looking back on 1996, Lu said that "an important experience
for use overcoming difficulties, to eliminate interferences, and
work well lies in our efforts to resolutely implement the work
principle of relying on the Hong Kong people and gearing to their
needs as put forth by President Jiang Zemin, and bring them fully
into play, allow them to be involved in the transition through
varied channels and in various ways," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the future work of the Preparatory Committee, Lu said, "It
does not mean that we can relax just because the first Chief
Executive-designate and the Provisional Legislative Council of the
Hong Kong SAR have been selected.
</P>
<P>
The Preparatory Committee has set up a working panel for the
first Legislative Council, which will study specific methods of
establishing the first Legislative Council of the Hong Kong SAR,
he said, and that many issues concerning Hong Kong laws, the
economy, and people's lives are yet to be studied.
</P>
<P>
The Preparatory Committee will report on progress in the
preparatory work at the National People's Congress to be held in
March.

<HEADLINE> Regional Factors Slows Jordan's Economy in 1996: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Regional factors slowed Jordan's
economic growth in 1996 to 5.3 percent, a fall from 6.6 percent in
1995, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The decrease in the growth rate was mainly attributed to
regional factors, which are beyond Jordan's control, according to
a signed article carried in Jordan Times, the kingdom's sole
English language daily.
</P>
<P>
The election of Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Natanyahu in
May brought about "a significant level of apprehension," and as he
began to fulfill his campaign promises, investment began to drop
in both Israel and Jordan, Yousuf Mansur, a Jordanian expert in
economics, said in the article.
</P>
<P>
Had Netanyahu not won the elections, a better regional
investment climate would have been sure to emerge, said Mansur.
</P>
<P>
Investment in Jordan has decreased slightly from the previous
year with imports representing 4.6 percent of the gross domestic
product (GDP), compared with 3.7 percent in 1995, the article said.
</P>
<P>
Per capita debt was 1,455 U.S. dollars in 1996, down from
1,467 dollars in 1995, it said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign grants amounted to 191.3 million Jordanian dinars
(about 273.3 dollars), a sum that was not as high as one would
wish and which is likely to decrease by 18 percent in 1997, the
article noted.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment decreased from 15 percent to 13 percent as
foreign labor markets opened to the Jordanians, according to the
article.
</P>
<P>
There are opportunities for Jordan to develop its economy in
1997 as Jordan is striving to sign a free trade agreement with the
European Union (EU) and has applied for accession to the World
Trade Organization, Mansur concluded.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Vows to Tackle Russia's Most Complicated Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said today he is ready to tackle the country's most complicated
problems.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who returned to work in the Kremlin last week after a
heart by-pass operation on November 5, said "the achievement of
concord and reconciliation is the task for next year."
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a New Year's Eve interview with Russia's three
leading news agencies -- Itar-Tass, Interfax and Ria Novosti --
Yeltsin said, "Our actions in the economy, politics and the
intellectual sphere must facilitate the overcoming of differences
among the Russian people," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian leader went on to say, "Specific action for the
good of the people is the most important of all" in the coming new
year and he expected 1997 to be "more successful" for Russia.
</P>
<P>
Summing up the most important achievements of the past year,
Yeltsin singled out three major events: the presidential and
local-government elections, peace in the breakaway region of
Chechnya, and success in curbing inflation.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, the situation in the country remains complicated.
We will make efforts in the new year to change things for the
better," the Russian President said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about 1996 in personal terms and what he was expecting
next year to bring, Yeltsin said, "This year had been difficult
for me, because of the elections, my heart disease and the surgery.
</P>
<P>
"Now I am ready to grapple with the most complicated problems
facing Russia...I should make up for the lost time."

<HEADLINE> Lu Ping Confident About Hong Kong's Future (4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When asked to comment on a series of remarks that opposed the
provisional legislature made by the British side on a number of
occasions in a vain attempt to internationalize the Hong Kong
question, Lu noted it is known to all that it is the British said
which unilaterally undermined the "through-train" arrangements,
and that the Chinese side made a decision to set up the
Provisional Legislative Council in order to ensure Hong Kong's
stable transition and proceed from Hong Kong's overall interests.
</P>
<P>
Some British oppose the Provisional Legislative Council, and
have said that the matter will have to be handed to be adjudicated
by the international courts, and this is futile, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said before its return, Hong Kong is a matter that concerns
China and Britain and, after 1997, Hong Kong affairs will be
China's internal affair, and that any attempt to internationalize
the issue will be unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the British side will take the whole situation
into account and look toward the future during the last half year
of rule, and shoulder the responsibility of a stable transition
and greet 1997 with a cooperative attitude," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lu said the new year will be an inspiring year, and that the
principle of "one country, two systems" initiated by Deng Xiaoping
will become a reality, and the aspirations of several generations
of Chinese will come true, and this is a great event for the
Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that in the coming year, the people of
Hong Kong will, as always, make an effort to build a bright future
for Hong Kong under the banner of loving the country and loving
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Lu concluded by wishing the people of Hong Kong and Macao a
happy new year and happiness and brisk business.

In a toast to his guests, Qian expressed his appreciation for

cooperation between their countries and China.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that in 1996, China began its Ninth Five-Year
Plan for the national economy and social development, and the
long-range goal for the year 2010, and has had achievements in
various fields. It was a year of fruitful diplomacy for China in
all fields, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In the coming year, the Chinese people will greet Hong Kong's
return to the motherland and the convening of 15th national
congress of the Chinese Communist Party with full confidence.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that these two important events in China's
political life will provide vigor for China's development and the
great cause of national re-unification.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the common task of all countries and the shared
aspiration of their peoples are to maintain peace and promote
development, and that in the coming year, China is ready to work
with countries around the world for a better future.

<HEADLINE> HongkongBank to Conduct Renminbi Business in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Hongkong and Shanghai
Banking Corporation Ltd. (HongkongBank) has got approval from the
People's Bank of China to set up a new branch in Pudong and
conduct renminbi business in Shanghai, HongkongBank said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The branch in Pudong will become the bank's main branch in
Shanghai, offering, in addition to the approved renminbi business,
 a full range of banking facilities in foreign currencies, as well
 as trade-related finance and other banking services. It will be
supported by a subbranch operating in Puxi.
</P>
<P>
Chris Langley, general manager for Hong Kong and China, said,
"We are very pleased with these latest developments in China. The
license to conduct Renminbi business is a major step forward in
China's financial reform and is welcomed by HongkongBank which is
committed to retaining its status as the leading foreign bank in
China."
</P>
<P>
In addition to Shanghai, HongkongBank has five other branches
in China, located in Beijing, Qingdao, Shenzhen, Tianjin and
Xiamen. The bank also has four representative offices in Chengdu,
Dalian, Guangzhou and Wuhan. Approval, however, has recently been
given to upgrade the representative office in Dalian to a branch.
</P>
<P>
HongkongBank, together with its subsidiaries, has nearly 600
offices in 20 Asian countries. It is a principal member of the
HSBC Group which, with more than 3,400 offices in 77 countries and
assets in excess of 400 billion U.S. dollars, is among the world's
largest banking and financial services institutions.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Standing Committee On HK Garrison Law  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The law on stationing troops
in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) adopted by
the 23rd Session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC)
Standing Committee was described today as being "another important
law to be implemented in the Hong Kong SAR following the Basic
Law."
</P>
<P>
The comment came from Zhou Nan, Wang Shuwen and Tsang Hin Chi,
members of the NPC Standing Committee, in interviews with Xinhua
today.
</P>
<P>
The three said they agree that, judging from the specific
provisions, the Garrison Law conforms to the Basic Law, and
demonstrates the spirit of "one country, two systems", which is
significant in safeguarding state sovereignty, unity,
reunification, and territorial integrity, and maintaining Hong
Kong's long-term stability, prosperity, and safety.
</P>
<P>
It took four years to draft, revise, and approve the law, and
the group who drafted the law read a total of 31 volumes of Hong
Kong Laws in English, more than 100 copies of cases in Hong Kong,
and translated one million words of materials, and studied British
jurisprudence and other countries' military legislation.
</P>
<P>
In the process of drafting the law, the opinions of the people
of Hong Kong were solicited in various ways, and the Eighth
National People's Congress Standing Committee repeatedly discussed
the draft of the Garrison law.
</P>
<P>
"This is a complete, systematic, and mature law for
administering the army," they said.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Press Association Boycotts Israeli Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Jordan Press Association
(JPA) has urged the press establishments and reporters not to
cover an Israeli trade fair scheduled to be held here in January,
a local press report said today.
</P>
<P>
The call was announced by the JPA Sunday to all the press
organizations in the kingdom in a signed memo which said the
boycott stemmed "from an overwhelming national rejection of the
idea" of holding such an event in Jordan, the local daily Jordan
Times reported.
</P>
<P>
It cited "the Israeli authorities' disregard for Arab rights,
escalation of criminal practices against the Palestinian people
and aggression on southern Lebanon" as the basis for its calls to
boycott the event.
</P>
<P>
"The Jordan Press Association is asking you to boycott the
exhibition, refrain from publishing anything about the event or
visiting it yourself," said the memo. It also urged the press
establishments and journalists to ask the public to be committed
to a "total boycott" of the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
An unidentified JPA board member said the decision to issue
the call was taken at a board meeting Sunday after the organizers
of the exhibition sent invitations to press establishments and
journalists to cover the event after obtaining special passes.
</P>
<P>
"The JPA board does not intend to take any punitive action
against its members who cover the event," said the board
member. He pointed out that reporters, including those of the
state-owned media, had no choice but to report on the exhibition
if asked to do so by their employer.
</P>
<P>
"It will be unfair for the JPA to adopt any action against
those who can not make their own decisions," he added
</P>
<P>
The trade exhibition will be the first Israeli exhibition to
be held in Jordan after the kingdom and the Jewish state signed a
peace treaty in October 1994.
</P>
<P>
The organizers of the exhibition said they are going ahead
with the project despite opposition from Jordanian political
activists and businessmen associations.
</P>
<P>
However, Jordanian opponents of normalization of ties with
Israel have reportedly set up a "national Jordanian committee for
canceling the Israeli trade fair," and are threatening Jordanians
who attend the fair with blacklisting.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Obeidat, former prime minister and chief of the
committee, said Saturday that the group comprising people from
the Parliament, political parties, trade unionists, women's
groups and human rights organizations, would create a blacklist
of participants, including reporters who will cover the event.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties argued that the trade fair would only
serve Israel's business interests of getting into the Arab
market.
</P>
<P>
Opposition force in the Parliament, led by the Islamic Action
Front (IAF) party, has called on the government to cancel the
Israeli exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Business organizations argued that the time is not opportune
for Israel to hold a trade fair in Jordan, given the stalled
implementation of the Israeli-Palestinian agreements.
</P>
<P>
They also said that a strong message should be sent to the
hardline Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Natanyahu that he could
not hope for economic benefits while he continued to refuse to
acknowledge and respect Palestinian rights.
</P>
<P>
According to Jordan Times, the government asserted that trade
fairs, whether Israeli or otherwise, were the affairs of the
private sector and pointed out that the Jordanian-Israeli peace
treaty provided for trade ties between the two countries. Thus,
its officials said, the government left it for the private sector
to make the decision as to develop whatever trade relations with
Israel.

<HEADLINE> MOFTEC Official on Economic Ties Across Taiwan Straits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The year 1996 saw a U-turn in
the development of economic and trade contacts between the two
sides of the Taiwan Straits, the latest issue of "Outlook"
magazine quotes Wang Hui, an official with the Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), as saying.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade increased in the first two months of the year,
then began to decline and hit its lowest level in June. In July,
it began to increase slightly, wang said in an interview with
Outlook.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the "Two Chinas" and "One China, One Taiwan"
policies pursued by the Taiwan Authorities caused a tense
situation between the two sides of the Straits, which affected
cross-the-straits trade and economic exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Owing to artificial obstacles and political factors, the volume
of trade between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits this year
remained at the same level as last year, wang said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said, the development of cross-the-straits
trade cannot be stopped because it is in the interests of people on
both sides of the Straits.
</P>
<P>
In looking forward to the trade development in 1997, wang
said that if the Taiwan authorities continue to pursue a policy of
tight-controls, circumstances will not be good for trade contacts,
something that we do not want to see.
</P>
<P>
But the official expressed the belief that the return of Hong
Kong to China and the possible entry of China into the World Trade
Organization will provide good opportunities for developing
economic and trade exchanges between the two sides of the
Straits.

<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The director of the Hong Kong
and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, Lu Ping, voiced his
confidence in the formation of the government of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) here today, while sending a
new year's message to the residents of Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua at a time as the new year ushers
in, Lu said that the past year has been an extraordinary year in
working towards Hong Kong's return to the motherland, and that at
the beginning of the year, the Preparatory Committee of the Hong
Kong SAR has started its preparations for the Hong Kong SAR in a
comprehensive way.
</P>
<P>
The committee did an in-depth study of major concerns for a
smooth transition, including Hong Kong's society and lifestyle,
and those involved in the formation of the SAR, and made a series
of important decisions, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The election of the first Chief Executive of the HK SAR and the
Provisional Legislative Council, were regarded as especially
significant achievements of the Preparatory Committee, laying a
solid foundation for the smooth transition, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the process of choosing the Chief Executive, he said, the
people of Hong Kong resorted to various methods and played an
active role in the election in an open, fair and just manner.
</P>
<P>
This gave full expression to the principles and guideline of
democracy and showed that the principle of the "Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong" entered a new stage, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Iranian FM: Iran Ready to Defend Itself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati said today "Iran is ready to defend itself"
against any aggression by all means at its disposal.
</P>
<P>
Velayati told reporters here that "Iran showed very strong
resistance against any foreign invasion in the past. So we are
familiar with such aggressions. We are also familiar with
atrocity."
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted European countries concern very much about
the safety of waterway in the Gulf, which handles two thirds of
total oil in the world.
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani had already warned
that Iran would block the waterway if it is attacked.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said recently that the situation in the
Persian Gulf is rather "tense" and "unsafe" due to foreign
military presence, especially the United States.
</P>
<P>
He called the military presence of foreign powers
"unprecedented in the world" and serves as "a obstacle to
the economic development in this part of the world."
</P>
<P>
meanwhile, Velayati today once again denied any kind of
Iranian involvement in bombing the American military base in
Dhahran last June, which killed 19 American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
He said that the United States and a number of other
countries have repeatedly accused Iran of such incidents since
the victory of the Islamic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
"But eventually it was demonstrated that all those
accusations were baseless," he added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the deployment of missiles on three disputed
islands in the Gulf, he said, "we have already announced the
official stance of Iran on the issue."
</P>
<P>
"What as published in Cairo as the eight countries'
communique is in fact a repetition of past statements. There
will be nothing coming out of such futile statements," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministers of Egypt, Syria and six Gulf Cooperation
Council states, members of the Damascus Declaration which was
formed in 1991 following the Gulf War, denounced in a communique
Sunday Iran for occupying three Gulf islands claimed by the United
Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
They said Iran had deployed missiles on disputed Gulf islands
of Abu Musa, Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb in "a direct threat to
the Gulf countries" and urged immediate Iranian withdrawal from the
islands.
</P>
<P>
Velayati reiterated that "Iran would undertake any measures
deemed necessary to defend its territorial integrity within the
confines of its territory, including the three Iranian islands of
Abu Musa, the Greater and Lesser Tunb."
</P>
<P>
"The measures we undertake in our country are by no means
offensive in nature or based on expansionist goals, but merely
defensive measures," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Welcomes Israeli Stand on Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 30 (Xinhua) -- A Jordanian government official
has said Jordan welcomed an Israeli stand on a proposal made by
King Hussein to grant a special status in Jerusalem, Jordan Time
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The official made the remarks Sunday while commenting
on a statement made by Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy.
</P>
<P>
"Israel's willingness to consider the proposal to begin a
dialogue between representatives of the three religions (of
Islam, Christianity and Judaism) on the special status of
Jerusalem and its holy places is positive and encouraging,"
the newspaper quoted the official as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We will consider King Hussein's proposal after the
implementation of the agreement on a military redeployment from
Hebron" on the West Bank, Levy said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"King Hussein has proposed a meeting of Moslem, Christian and
Jewish leaders to discuss a special status for Jerusalem and for
its holy places." he said.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian official said that King Hussein has stressed the
necessity that the holy city be "a symbol of peace and given a
special status for Moslems, Christians and Jews, but his appeals
did not strike a chord within Israel."
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian king called in September for the formation of an
international commission on the holy sites in Jerusalem after
Israel opened a new entrance to an archeological tunnel outside
the Al Aqsa Mosque compound, which ignited a storm of protests in
the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
The clashes between Israeli troops and Palestinian protesters
and police left 86 people dead.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian official said that during the talks with Levy in
Amman this month, King Hussein brought up the proposal again.
</P>
<P>
The United States, the main sponsor of the Middle East peace
process and Israel's closest ally, has not publicly commented on
the proposal. The British government has reportedly welcomed the
idea.
</P>
<P>
In his comments Sunday, Levy said "King Hussein is very
concerned that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (will) not become
a religious conflict and raised the proposal again during my
latest meeting with him."
</P>
<P>
Levy emphasized that, as far as Israel was concerned, the
proposal was not aimed at turning Jerusalem into "a capital for
the three religions" and reiterated that Israel would not give up
its claim to sovereignty over the city.
</P>
<P>
The status of Jerusalem is to be discussed between Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators as part of talks on the final
status of the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, which has maintained its role as the guardian of
Islamic holy sites in Jerusalem, fully supports the Palestinian
demand for the return of Arab East Jerusalem as the capital of an
independent Palestinian state.

<HEADLINE> Hungary Witnesses Unusual Climate in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Temperatures plunged to minus
29 degrees Celsius in Hungary yesterday, making it the coldest day
in a century, the Hungarian Meteorogical Observatory said today.
</P>
<P>
The freezing weather caught Hungarians off-guard as average
daily temperatures at this time of year only fall to around minus
three degrees Celsius.
</P>
<P>
But the sub-zero temperatures are only the latest in a string
of unseasonal weather to hit the country in 1996 which caused
major problems for farmers with crop planting and harvesting.
</P>
<P>
Hungary clocked up 97 days of snowfall in winter 1995 and
spring 1996, double the normal amount.
</P>
<P>
Summer weather was also unusual, with unseasonally hot weather
in early June, violent storms in July which caused extensive
property damage, and lower than average temperatures in August.
</P>
<P>
In September, torrential rain fell across the country, three to
four times more than the seasonal average rainfall this century.

<TEXT>
<P>
Johannesburg, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The South African
Communist Party (SACP) has called on peoples of the nation to
spare no efforts to overcome unemployment.
</P>
<P>
In its New Year's message, SACP General Secretary Charles
Nqakula said 1997 must be a year in which South Africans
harnessed all the country resources in an effort to overcome "the
terrible scourge of unemployment".
</P>
<P>
Nqakula said workers, youngsters and all the poor people in
urban and rural areas should not give way to cynicism,
selfishness or despair. The people waiting for jobs should never
lose faith, or their job opportunity will indeed not come about,
he said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is a country with a high unemployment rate, which
has registered at about 30 percent for years.
</P>
<P>
Of all the unemployed, black people, who are lack of knowlege
and techniques becuase of poor education in the apartheid period,
usually suffer the most. enditem

<HEADLINE> Program-Controlled Switch Makers Unify Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- China's manufacturers of
program-controlled telephone switching machine have reached an
agreement to coordinate their development and set a common
technical standard.
</P>
<P>
According to the Beijing-based "People's Posts and
Telecommunications News," since January 1, 1997, all the country's
makers of the 04 switch gear, the first large-capacity
program-controlled switching system developed by Chinese
scientists, will readjust their development pace and abide by a
set of agreements on producing scale, component supply, trademark,
market strategies, quality control, post-sale service and
technical renovation.
</P>
<P>
The Great Dragon Telecom Co (GDT)., a national-level industrial
company which was jointly funded by China's eight producers of 04
switches, will serve as the sole agent for the 04 machines both on
domestic and overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
The 04 machine has led the sales of domestic switches for five
years. By the end of October, some eight million lines of 04
machines were sold in the country, covering 28 provinces,
municipalities and autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
GDT's unifications drive is viewed by local analysts as a new
strategy for the Chinese telecom industry to break the monopoly of
foreign products on the switching machine market.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Economy Estimated To Grow 9.7 Percent This Year (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese economy is
estimated to grow 9.7 percent in comparable prices this year, with
a gross domestic product of 6,780 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural sector is to grow 5.1 percent while the
industrial and tertiary sectors will grow 12.3 percent and eight
percent respectively this year, announced Ye Zhen, spokesman for
the State Statistics Bureau today.
</P>
<P>
He said that China is expected to reap in more than 480 million
tons of grain this year, setting a new historical record.
</P>
<P>
Output of China's cotton crops will shrink to about four
million tons, a decrease of 800,000 tons from last
year. Meanwhile, the total amount of oil-bearing crops will go
down by 600,000 tons, reaching 21.9 million tons this year.
</P>
<P>
The decrease of cotton and oil-bearing crops is due to the
reduction of growing areas, he explained.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that China's animal husbandry and fishery
also witnessed stable growth this year, with output of both meat
and aquatic products increasing by about ten percent.
</P>
<P>
Ye said that the incremental value of Chinese industry is
expected to grow about 13 percent this year, and that the growth
rate is one percentage point less than last year.
</P>
<P>
"Production of radios, watches, bicycles, kitchen air
ventilation systems, vacuum cleaners and most textile products
dropped this year," he said, "while outputs of computers,
program-controlled switchboards, VCRs, Hi-fi systems and air
conditioners enjoyed stable growth."
</P>
<P>
He said that China's fixed assets investment is estimated to
rise 18.9 percent -- 12.5 percent in real terms with inflation
factor taken into account -- to 2,380 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that although China terminated the linking
of interest rates with price indexes and cut down the interest
rates twice this year, the market remained stable.
</P>
<P>
"This year, China's retail sales volume will grow 19.4 percent
on an annual basis, or a real growth rate of 13 percent, to 2,460
billion yuan," he said. "Generally speaking, supply is slightly
bigger than demand."
</P>
<P>
He said that China's foreign trade volume is estimated to rise
by 3.3 percent to 290 billion US dollars. The export will grow by
around three percent to 153 billion US dollars, while the import
will grow by around four percent to 137 billion US dollars. China
enjoyed a foreign trade surplus of 16 billion US dollars in 1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
The spokesman said that China is expected to receive around 48
billion US dollars of foreign investment, with foreign direct
investment surpassing 40 billion US dollars at an increase of
seven percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign exchange reserve reached a new level to exceed
100 billion US dollars in 1996, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary estimates, he said, China's retail
price index will rise by six percent this year -- a growth rate
that is about 8.8 percentage points less than that of last year.
</P>
<P>
"China has more than completed its target in macro-economic
regulation of curbing inflation at around ten percent for the
whole year and the inflation rate is much lower than the economic
growth rate," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese urban people's per capita income is to
rise by 3.4 percent in real terms to 4,380 yuan this year.
</P>
<P>
As for the rural residents, he said, thanks to the raising of
grain purchase prices and a better harvest this year, their per
capita income will grow by eight percent in comparable prices to
1,900 yuan.
</P>
<P>
"To sum up, the year 1996 ushered in a stable and appropriately
growing economy for China," he said. "However, with a weak
agricultural base and the serious losses of some state-owned
enterprises, China is still confronted with a huge task in
macro-economic control, reform and development."
</P>
<P>
Looking towards 1997, Ye expressed optimism about the economic
situation.
</P>
<P>
"1997 is an extraordinarily unusual year in China's history,
with resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong and the opening of
the 15th national congress of the Communist Party of China on the
agenda," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Judging from various factors both in the domestic and
international spheres, the Chinese economy will continue to
develop at a stable and rapid growth rate."

<P>
MACAO, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Businessmen from Taiwan and
Macao will jointly launch a Taiwan Products Center in Macao,
aiming to pave the way for the entry of Taiwan products to the
mainland market.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Products Center, scheduled to be inaugurated here
Tuesday and to offer thousands of kinds of Taiwan products, is the
first of its kind in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Jose Cheong Vai Chi, president of the center, said the center
costs a combined investment of 30 million Hong Kong dollars (about
3.88 million U.S. dollars), with half from local investors and
half from Taiwan investors.
</P>
<P>
The center is only a starting point in promoting trade between
Taiwan and the mainland, said Chi, who has contacted local
businessmen in Guangzhou, Zhuhai and Zhongshan cities in south
China's Guangdong Province for plans to expand shop chains to
those places.
</P>
<P>
"We can also be a 'matchmaker' in promoting mainland products
to Taiwan. We can reprocess mainland products here in Macao and
then re-export them to Taiwan," he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed an optimistic view on trade between the mainland
and Taiwan, saying it would be the center's main source of
profits.
</P>
<P>
The center will initially deal with foodstuffs and household
appliances, plus computers, arts and crafts, brand-name fashion
and sportswear. It plans to expand its business scope to more than
20,000 kinds in the future, said Chi.

<HEADLINE> Feature: A Glance at Zambia's Pre-School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Wang Nengbiao)
</P>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Some children are signing,
some are drawing pictures in classrooms, and others are playing
on the playing ground at the compound of the Longacres Day-Care
Nursery School in capital Lusaka. All of them look happy.
</P>
<P>
There are 20 childern and two teachers at the school which
opened early this year. Several boys and girls from foreign
countries are getting along very well with the local children at
the school. The school owner, Mary Chongo herself prepares lunch
for the children who have come from families of government
officials, businessmen, doctors, workers and individual laborers.
</P>
<P>
Of them, the yongest is only 15 months and the oldest six
years old. Some stay here in the morning and some the whole day.
The half-day care costs 150,000 Kwacha (about 115 U.S.Dollars)
and the all-day care costs 200,000 Kwacha (154 Dollars) for three
months. Middle-class families can afford to send their children
to the school, Chongo said.
</P>
<P>
In lusaka, there are many private nursery schools like this.
Generally speaking, the private schools provide much better
education and accommodations than those run by city councils.
</P>
<P>
Parents send their children to the expensive private schools
to enable children having access to a better pre-school education
before their childern go to primary shools.
</P>
<P>
In Longacres School Curriculum includes English, mathematics,
music, painting, sanitary, environmental and social science and
Creative activities. The curriculum aims at providing the
children with opportunities and experience necessary for the
development of mental, physical and emotional, spiritual and
moral abilities and potentialities.
</P>
<P>
The Children have been divided into different age groups to
perform activities suitable for them under a national pre-school
syllabus.
</P>
<P>
Zambia has attached importance to the pre-school education.
The Zambia Pre-School Association (ZPA),since its formation in
1972, has opened workshops to train teachers for pre-school
education in both rural and urban communities. A two-year
pre-school teachers course is now going on at David Livingstone
Teachers Training College and Kitwe Teachers Training College.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Confidence In 1997 Handover Rising in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Prospects of Hong Kong under
China's sovereignty are becoming more and more encouraging as
1997 sets in, overshadowing the gloomy perceptions that a
confidence crisis would drag Hong Kong into demise.
</P>
<P>
The common myths to show a loss of confidence in 1997 included
huge outflows of capital, an exodus of talents, faltering economy
and political uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
However, from a review of the recent developments in Hong Kong
one can find a completely different picture and much rosy one at
that.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has enjoyed a 12-percent growth in bank deposits
since 1990, with HK dollar deposits rising steadily to account for
 55 percent of the total currency deposits now. There are no signs
 of people's confidence in the HK dollar eroding. The local
currency, pegged to the U.S. dollar, is expected to remain firm
after 1997. Moreover, the hefty foreign exchange reserves,
totaling 60 billion U.S. dollars, form the bedrock of Hong Kong's
financial stability.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is the sixth largest recipient of foreign direct
investment (FDI) among Asian developing economies, drawing 2.1
billion U.S. dollars in 1995, according to the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development. It is also the single largest
exporter of FDI in the developing world, pumping outflows of 25
billion U.S. dollars in 1995, with a good part going to the
Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
Fewer people are leaving Hong Kong and more are coming in
search of opportunities. There are a great number of "returned
emigrants", who have realized that the city is still a much better
place to make a living than any of the emigrant destinations --
a clear sign of confidence in the future. With a lot of
professionals among the returnees, the anticipated brain drain is
unlikely to happen in 1997 and beyond.
</P>
<P>
Opportunity is also luring foreign companies to base their
regional headquarters in Hong Kong, a springboard into the Chinese
mainland and other Asian economies. A recent survey conducted by
the 2,700-member American Chamber of Commerce (Amcham) shows that
business confidence in Hong Kong reached a record high. Over 95
percent of the respondents are "favorable" or "very favorable" of
Hong Kong's business environment in the next five years, up four
percentage points from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Amcham Chairman Mark Michelson said: "The well-established
legal system, superior infrastructure, communications network,
free-port status and low taxes make Hong Kong a very attractive
location for regional business operations."
</P>
<P>
As a main barometer of Hong Kong's economy, property market
bottomed out in January and gained strong momentum throughout the
year. Property developers paid record high prices to bid for lots
of land at auction, banks competed to cut mortgage loan rates to
lure home buyers, and rentals and purchases prices for houses and
office buildings jumped. The latest government statistics show
that agreements for sales and purchases of properties in November
shot up 100 percent in volume, and 300 percent in value over the
same month of 1995. Buying properties is really a test of
confidence in the future of the city, said a securities
researcher.

<HEADLINE> Displaced Workers in China Seek New Opportunities (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- It's been more than six months
since Zhang Xinlan was displaced from her job in a machine
fittings factory in Beijing. After an initial period of deep
frustration, she has finally come to terms with her situation.
</P>
<P>
"This was a crisis that had to be overcome sooner or later,"
the 28-year-old woman said. "The important thing is to find
another job."
</P>
<P>
Due to management difficulties, the factory where Zhang worked
was forced to suspend part of its production last April, and more
than 40 employees including Zhang were displaced -- virtually laid
off.
</P>
<P>
Zhang's case is not rare in today's China, which is in the
process of a far-reaching marketization drive. Since the late
1980s, the number of displaced workers has been on the rise,
reaching some seven million by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Officially speaking, displacement, or "xiagang" in Chinese, is
similar to, yet different from unemployment. A displaced worker no
longer has a job, but if conditions improve in the factory and the
worker is needed again, his former post becomes available again.
</P>
<P>
In reality, this doesn't often happen. In China, the vast
majority of state-owned enterprises suffer from the problems of
low efficiency and too many workers doing the same job. A reduced
staff and enhanced efficiency are crucial in order to establish a
management mechanism in line with a market economy.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, displacement, like unemployment, spells troubles.
</P>
<P>
"With state-owned enterprises deepening their reform and the
country readjusting its industrial structure, China is bound to
have more displaced workers and thus be under increased pressure
from unemployment," said Bai Hejin, deputy secretary-general of the
State Planning Commission. "And the state is seeking solutions for
the problem."
</P>
<P>
Despite the rising displacement, China still maintains a good
employment record. By the end of this year, the registered number
of jobless people in cities and towns has reached 5.6 million,
representing an unemployment rate of three percent.
</P>
<P>
Lu Jianhua, a sociologist with the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, said that displacement is a "sensible and realistic
transitional measure" by the state, taking into account both the
reform and social stability.
</P>
<P>
Under the former planned economic system, he pointed out, the
welfare of Chinese workers was the duty of employers due to the
lack a well-developed social security system.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Jian, a specialist on labor relations and the host of a
workers' hotline in the Chinese capital, has taken notice of the
shift of the displaced workers' focus of attention in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"In the past, most of the phone calls were bitter complaints,
and the callers were apparently deeply depressed," said Qiao. "Now
the callers have become much calmer, and are mostly interested in
how to find a new job."
</P>
<P>
He added that Chinese workers, accustomed to the idea of
lifelong employment in state-owned enterprises -- a practice known
in China as the "iron rice bowl" -- have gradually accepted a new
understanding of employment under the market economy, and their
ability to withstand the pressure of job displacement has been
enhanced.
</P>
<P>
The result of a survey on displaced women workers in Shanghai,
China's most economically developed city, supports Qiao's
assumption. Only three percent of those surveyed said they thought
it is "a shame to go out all by oneself to look for a new job."

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Deposits, Loans Rise in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's deposits, loans
and advances rose in November, according to statistics from the
Hong Kong Monetary Authority.
</P>
<P>
Total deposits rose by 3.6 percent in November, following a
growth of 1.7 percent in October. The increase was mainly led by
a 5.2 percent growth in HK dollar deposits, which outpaced a 1.5
percent rise in foreign currency deposits.
</P>
<P>
HK dollar deposits recorded notable growth in both time
deposits and savings deposits.
</P>
<P>
Savings and time deposits rose by 4.1 and 6.6 percent
respectively, compared to their respective growth of 2.3 percent
and 3.5 percent in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Total loans and advances grew by 2.5 percent in November,
following a slight rise of 0.1 percent in October. The rise was
broadly based, with an expansion in domestic credit by 4 percent
and a rise in offshore loans by 1.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Of the domestic credit, loans for trade financing rose by 0.4
percent in November, the first monthly increase after consecutive
declines in the previous four months.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Confidence In 1997 Handover Rising In HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For Hong Kong's economy in 1997, optimism prevails, with GDP
growth forecast at above five percent along with robust consumer
spending and export volume. This year, retail market has staged a
modest but sustainable recovery and the unemployment rate has
fallen to 2.7 percent from 3.5 percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Optimism is also creeping into many opinion polls that track
Hong Kong people's sentiment toward the handover. A recent social
survey conducted by the University of Hong Kong shows that 70
percent of people are confident in Hong Kong's future overall. It
is the highest level ever recorded since the university began
tracking confidence in January 1994.
</P>
<P>
The selection of the administrative leader and of the
provisional legislature this month fortified Hong Kong people's
confidence in the future Special Administrative Region (SAR).
These two political events, broadcast live on the local radio and
television, convinced Hong Kong people of Beijing's determination
to fully implement the principles of "one country, two systems",
"Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and a high degree of
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Upbeat sentiments prevail in the community when transition is
going into the substantial stage and preparations for forming the
HKSAR government are in full swing. Tung Chee Hwa, HKSAR Chief
Executive designate, is widely accepted as a leader of
credibility, who wrapped up an overwhelming majority of 320 votes
from a 400-strong Selection Committee on December 11. Brushing
aside previous misunderstandings, many local citizens are
supportive to the 60-seat Provisional Legislative Council (PLC),
which, elected on December 21, is essential to avoid a "legal
vacuum" after Hong Kong's handover in mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
As Tung Chee Hwa put it, the only resource Hong Kong has is its
wealthy human talents, who are sufficiently equipped to face
challenges. Over the past 150 years, Hong Kong people have time
and again turned uncertainties into opportunities for big
development with resilience, dynamism and entrepreneur spirit.
That is why more and more Hong Kong people have come to believe
that 1997 is a process, not a date.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Plans to Export 108,000 Tons of Coffee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Coffee and Tea
Authority of Ethiopia has announced that it would earn 236
million dollars from the export of 108,000 tons of coffee in the
1996-97 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
General Manager of the authority Tsegaye Birhane told the
local press that the plan is the highest ever in the coffee
export history of the country and six percent more than the
figure exported in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
He said the country has already earned 92 million dollars from
the sale in the world market of 36,907 tons of coffee in the
first five months of this fiscal year, which starts on July 8,
1996, and ends on July 7, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The decline in coffee prices on the world market makes the
decrease of earning for Ethiopia from coffee export in recent
eyars. Ethiopia earned 279.5 million dollars from the sale of
102,000 tons of coffee in 1995-96 and 287.8 million dollars from
exporting 78,420 tons of coffee in 1994-95.
</P>
<P>
Coffee is the source of more than half of the country's hard
currency earnings. About 25 percent of the Ethiopians are engaged
in coffee production, trade or related activities directly or
indirectly. enditem

<HEADLINE> Nigeria To Benefit From WHO's Anti-Cholera </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria and 15 other West
African countries are to benefit from an anti-cholera project
sponsored by the World Health Organization (WHO), the "Guardian"
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a WHO report as saying that the annual cases
of cholera in west Africa has exploded from 7,000 in 1993 to
42,500 in the first nine months of this year, a more than
six-fold increase.
</P>
<P>
The number of cholera fatalities has risen even faster during
the same period from 369 deaths in 1993 to more than 2,900 this
year, the WHO report said.
</P>
<P>
West Africa now accounts for two-thirds of the cases on the
continent and more than 70 percent of all cholera deaths, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
The anti-cholera project will be jointly funded by the
Regional Office for Africa of the WHo and a special grant from
the Swiss government.
</P>
<P>
The project aims to reduce the cholera fatality to one percent
or less by improving case management, especially by promoting
greater use of the oral rehydration solution and in severe cases,
appropriate antibiotics, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Other beneficiary countries are Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon,
Chad, Cote d'Ivoire, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau,
Liberia, Mali, Niger, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo, the report
added.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Nigeria has been ranked among the
worst 16 countries in the world in terms of last year's
Under-Five-Child Mortality Rate by the just-released State of the
World Children, 1997, a publication of the United Nations
Children Fund UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
According to the UNICEF report, Nigeria has an under-five
child mortality rate of 191 per 1,000, showing no big difference
with the rate of 204 per 1,000 at its independence in 1960.

<HEADLINE> Displaced Workers in China Seek New Opportunities (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Xu Zhenghui, the labor division chief with the All-China
Federation of Trade Unions, said displacement is closely related
to workers' immediate interests, and it is unavoidable that some
workers have reacted in a drastic way.
</P>
<P>
Displacement, though a potential destabilizing factor, has not
had much impact on social stability, Xu pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"The good thing is that the whole society is showing concern
for displaced workers, and governments from the central level down
to the local levels and social organizations are working together
to find ways out for these workers," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government launched a re-employment project last
year, aimed at helping displaced and laid off people to find new
jobs.
</P>
<P>
The project, by way of fund appropriation and policy guidance,
incorporated promotion of the service industry, small enterprises
and community services, and increased services in employment
information, unemployment insurance and training for
reassignment. It is being carried out in 200 cities in 22
provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, a re-employment service center has been set up,
which provides training for displaced workers and helps them
either find jobs in other facilities or start their own business.
</P>
<P>
Some 860,000 people have been laid off in the city over the
past five years; 660,000 of them have found new positions.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xinlan is interested in dressmaking, and has been
attending a dressmaker's training course for four months. "I'd
like to try my hand at opening a little dressmaking shop," she
said.
</P>
<P>
And many who were displaced before Zhang have started new
businesses. Wang Ruizhen, a former textile worker in the east
China city of Qingdao, opened a furniture store in the latter half
of last year, with the support of the local government. The
38-year-old woman has since accumulated assets worth several
hundreds of thousands of yuan.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, three million people have
turned to professional counseling services, 1.1 million attended
reassignment training courses, and 2.43 million landed new jobs
under the re-employment project.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Labor said China will continue to organize 2.5
million displaced and laid off workers to participate in the
project.
</P>
<P>
Some displaced workers still face problems of difficult living
conditions, admitted Bai Hejin of the State Planning
Commission. He said the state grants temporary subsidies to those
who have a hard time keeping minimum standards of living. Two
million people across the country have received the subsidies.
</P>
<P>
"For long-term benefits," Bai noted, "the government will
create more job opportunities by furthering economic expansion. On
the other hand, it will accelerate the reform process and strive
to build a complete social security system that covers workers
of all kinds of enterprises by the end of the century."
</P>
<P>
A sample survey made recently by the State Commission for
Restructuring the Economy shows that the vast majority of workers
support the ongoing reform of the economic system, and agree over
the direction the reform is taking.

according to Qiao, who explained to the meeting.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Qian on Relations With Surrounding Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- China has scored new progress
in its relations with neighboring countries this year, Chinese
Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said here today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, he noted that Chinese President
Jiang Zemin visited three South Asian nations and the Philippines
in 1996. The trips were successful, Qian said, and is an important
diplomatic move for consolidating the peaceful environment around
China.
</P>
<P>
China and these four countries have determined the 21st
century-oriented path of development, Qian said, adding that China
and India signed an important agreement aimed at strengthening
mutual trust. And for the first time, China explained,
comprehensively and systematically, its policy toward south Asia,
the Chinese foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
Also this year, Chinese Premier Li Peng attended the Eighth
Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
During 1996, Chinese leaders visited the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the
Republic of Korea -- all trips deepened mutual understanding,
enhanced friendship and expanded cooperation between China and
these countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
China also became a dialoque partner of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) this year, and the relations
between the two sides advanced to a new step, Qian noted.
</P>
<P>
In addition to advancing economic and trade relations with its
neighboring countries, China has also explored new ways to expand
economic exchanges, such as making full use of non-governmental
organizations and capital, and increasing economic and trade
cooperation with its small and medium-sized neighboring nations,
the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that all of these efforts have created a fine basis
and impetus to promote the overall development of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
China has carried out multi-faceted security dialogue and
cooperation, Qian said, and China's position on settling disputes
through peaceful negotiations has been well received from other
nations.
</P>
<P>
During Chinese President's visit to the Philippines, the two
sides agreed to set aside differences and engage in joint
exploration, and this will greatly benefit the peaceful settlement
of the Nansha question, Qian pointed out.
</P>
<P>
China has also actively participated in regional political and
security discussions and cooperation, including the ASEAN forum,
which has deepened mutual trust and understanding between China
and its neighboring countries, and has contributed to peace and
stability in the region, Qian said.

<HEADLINE> China Preparing for Railway Transport Peak over Spring Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Railways will
add a total of 111 trains to accommodate China's annual
transportation blitz during the Spring Festival -- the Chinese
Lunar New Year -- which falls on February 7, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Included are 45 long-distance trains and 66 trains for medium
and short journeys, with a total of 4,640 cars, according to Yao
Jinzhu, an official of the Transportation Department of the
Ministry of Railways.
</P>
<P>
The transport peak will last for 50 days, from January 18 to
March 8. It is estimated that trains will carry 133 million
travelers during the period, a slight drop over 1996, and the
number of long-distance passengers will reach 29.3 million, up 4.6
percent, she said.
</P>
<P>
New rail lines, especially the Beijing-Kowloon railway, will
have much more train travelers during the Spring Festival,
Yao said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is also taking into consideration the fact that
some areas struck by severe flooding this year will receive a
greater influx of travelers, mostly former residents there who
were displaced and are returning home for the holidays, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Ticket prices will not be raised during the festival, Yao
said. The Ministry of Railways will place emphasis on passenger
transport on 11 trunk lines, including Beijing-Guangzhou,
Beijing-Shanghai, and Beijing-Harbin railways, and lengthen the
service section of ten pairs of long-distance trains, Yao said.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the ministry will put into temporary
service 17 pairs of passenger trains, which have been added to a
new rail schedule to become operational next April 1.
</P>
<P>
No boxcars will be used during the Spring Festival, she said,
adding that efforts will be made to increase the number of ticket
offices, expand the use of computerized ticketing systems, and
lengthen periods for ticket booking.
</P>
<P>
She said that priority will be given to transport college
students who will return home during the winter holiday.

<HEADLINE> Qian on Sino-EU Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Developing long-term and
stable cooperative relations between China and the European Union
not only serves the interest of both sides, but also will
contribute to world peace, stability and development.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen made the
comment today in an interview with Xinhua. He said that there have
been frequent high-level exchanges of visit between China and some
members of the European Union this year.
</P>
<P>
The EU is China's fourth largest trade partner, and one of the
country's main cooperative partners in the fields of investment
and technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that bilateral cooperation in scientific,
technological, cultural and educational fields has also been
expanded.
</P>
<P>
In December 1995, the European Commission approved a long-term
policy on Sino-European relations. One month ago, the commission
adopted a new Strategy towards China, which is more specific and
further stresses its comprehensive, independent and long-term
policy towards China, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
China welcomes all this, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, the two sides have different views on certain
questions, and there still exist some problems in their bilateral
ties which cannot be neglected, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
China hopes that the EU will cancel its trade protection
measures against China's exports, in order to benefit the smooth
development of bilateral trade, Qian noted.
</P>
<P>
As long as the two sides abide by the principles of mutual
respect, seeking common ground while reserving differences,
non-interference into each other's internal affairs and equality
and mutual benefit, China-EU relations can continue to grow
steadily, Qian said.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Fund Prepares to Enter China's Retail Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- A development fund registered
in the Cayman Islands is seeking partners to break into the huge
Chinese retail market.
</P>
<P>
The new "China Commerce Development Fund" involves a total
registered capital of 167.5 million US dollars from the American
International Group of the United States, as well as several
companies from Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
The fund's managers are looking for powerful overseas retail
developers to be their technical partners, and large Chinese
state-owned commercial enterprises to serve as their business
partners to help tap into the Chinese market, sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government's relevant policies and project approval
procedures will be strictly observed, the sources noted.
</P>
<P>
The response of the Chinese commercial sector to the fund has
been positive.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the main purpose of opening up the retail
market is to promote the modernization of Chinese retail
enterprises and boost the market.
</P>
<P>
And since the retail market is diverse, including department
stores, supermarket and commodity distribution centers, it is
necessary to offer guidance to overseas investors to help them
invest wisely. The special fund makes it easier to do just that,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts also pointed out that the fund also reflects
the growing interest of overseas investors in China's retail
market.
</P>
<P>
Chinese government leaders and high-ranking officials in charge
of the commercial sector have on many occasions this year expressed
the willingness to open up the retail market still wider.
</P>
<P>
Eleven cities are now experimenting with the opening-up of the
retail market, and officials are considering ways to increase the
number, and to open the wholesale market to overseas
developers.

<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- China has scored new progress
in its relations with neighboring countries this year, Chinese
Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said here today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, he noted that Chinese President
Jiang Zemin visited three South Asian nations and the Philippines
in 1996. The trips were successful, Qian said, and is an important
diplomatic move for consolidating the peaceful environment around
China.
</P>
<P>
China and these four countries have determined the 21st
century-oriented path of development, Qian said, adding that China
and India signed an important agreement aimed at strengthening
mutual trust. And for the first time, China explained,
comprehensively and systematically, its policy toward south Asia,
the Chinese foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
Also this year, Chinese Premier Li Peng attended the Eighth
Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
During 1996, Chinese leaders visited the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the
Republic of Korea -- all trips deepened mutual understanding,
enhanced friendship and expanded cooperation between China and
these countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
China also became a dialoque partner of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) this year, and the relations
between the two sides advanced to a new step, Qian noted.
</P>
<P>
In addition to advancing economic and trade relations with its
neighboring countries, China has also explored new ways to expand
economic exchanges, such as making full use of non-governmental
organizations and capital, and increasing economic and trade
cooperation with its small and medium-sized neighboring nations,
the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that all of these efforts have created a fine basis
and impetus to promote the overall development of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
China has carried out multi-faceted security dialogue and
cooperation, Qian said, and China's position on settling disputes
through peaceful negotiations has been well received from other
nations.
</P>
<P>
During Chinese President's visit to the Philippines, the two
sides agreed to set aside differences and engage in joint
exploration, and this will greatly benefit the peaceful settlement
of the Nansha question, Qian pointed out.
</P>
<P>
China has also actively participated in regional political and
security discussions and cooperation, including the ASEAN forum,
which has deepened mutual trust and understanding between China
and its neighboring countries, and has contributed to peace and
stability in the region, Qian said.

Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said here today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Qian said China and the Latin
American countries are all developing nations, and have the same
development plans and good bases of cooperation. Although
geographically far apart, exchanges of high-level visits between
China and Latin America have been frequent.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that he talked with foreign ministers of the RIO
Group on six separate occasions during the annual United Nations
General Assembly held in New York City.
</P>
<P>
From January to November this year, the total trade volume
between China and Latin America totaled 6.03 billion US dollars, up
12.6 percent over the same period in 1995, Qian noted.
</P>
<P>
And there have been more exchanges between China and the Latin
American countries which had not previously forged diplomatic ties
with China, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
China and Panama have set up trade development offices in each
other's capital cities, Qian noted, adding that China and Haiti
have reached an agreement to establish a trade cooperation
office.

SHANGHAI, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai customs
authority and the city's local branch of the Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China recently signed a contract to co-develop

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Great achievements have been
scored in Sino-African relations in 1996 thanks to joint efforts
from the two sides, Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen said today.
</P>
<P>
Qian said in an interview with Xinhua that there have been
frequent high-level exchange of visits between China and African
countries this year.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin visited six African countries this
May and spelled out a five-point proposal on Sino-African
relations, forging a solid basis that will allow for a long-term,
stable, and comprehensive cooperative relationship between China
and African countries and enable them to successfully usher in the
21st century, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
China pays close attention to Africa, the foreign minister
said, adding that non-colonization on the African continent is one
of the significant achievements of human civilization after World
War II, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Most African countries stick to the "one China" policy, and the
"pragmatic diplomacy" carried out by Taiwan has become
increasingly unpopular, Qian noted.
</P>
<P>
China and African countries have further increased their
consultation and cooperation in international affairs, he said. In
the recent election for U.N. Secretary-General, China and African
countries agreed that the U.N. chief official should be elected
from a candidate proposed by African countries.
</P>
<P>
Qian said he believed that China and African countries will
create a brighter future in Sino-African relations.

<HEADLINE> Law on Stationing Troops in HK SAR Adopted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Law on Stationing Troops
in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) was adopted
at the 23rd session of the Standing Committee of the Eighth
National People's Congress in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
New revisions were made on two articles of the draft law, based
on the revisions made at the last session of the NPC Standing
Committee.
</P>
<P>
After the rewrite, the fourth clause of Article 16 of the law
states that the military personnel "shall take good care of the
public property of the Hong Kong SAR and the private property
owned by the Hong Kong residents as well as other people."
</P>
<P>
The previous version said that the military personnel "shall
take good care of the public property of the Hong Kong SAR and the
private property owned by the Hong Kong residents."
</P>
<P>
As some members suggested that stricter stipulations be made on
the issue that the troops and military personnel shall not be
engaged in the profit-making businesses, Article 18 was revised as
follows: "The troops and military personnel stationed in the Hong
Kong SAR shall not be engaged in profit-making businesses by any
forms, nor can the military personnel be engaged in any other
activity incompatible with their obligation."
</P>
<P>
The Law on Stationing Troops in the Hong Kong SAR contains 30
articles in six chapters, including the general principles, the
obligations of the troops, the relationship between the troops and
the Hong Kong SAR government, duties and discipline of the
military personnel, jurisdiction concerned with the military
personnel, and supplementary provisions.
</P>
<P>
The law will go into effect on July 1, 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators are scheduled to hold another round of talks this
afternoon on the Israeli army's redeployment in the West Bank
town of Hebron, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, Israeli army Chief
of Staff Amnon Lipkin-Shahak and Palestinian top negotiator
Mahmoud Abbas will join in the talks on a later stage.
</P>
<P>
A decision will be taken in the evening for setting up a
timetable for another summit meeting between Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu and Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
After a 90-minute meeting with Arafat Sunday night in Gaza,
Mordechai expressed his hope that the outstanding differences
could be resolved during today's negotiations.
</P>
<P>
However, Arafat said that an agreement has not been reached
on the question of joint patrol close to the Machpela Cave (the
Ibrahimi Mosque), and on the Palestinian demand that a
prisoners-release coincide with the redeployment.
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian source told Israel Radio that progress was made
at Sunday night's talks, and he predicted that a
Netanyahu-Arafat summit would take place Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. special Middle East coordinator Dennis Ross is
due to arrive today in a bid to bring the final stages of
the protracted Hebron talks to a successful conclusion.
</P>
<P>
Today's Jerusalem Post quoted an unidentified U.S. official as
saying that Washington is heartened by what they call Egypt's
"support for the Palestinians (in) wrapping up the talks."
</P>
<P>
Arafat returned from the Egyptian capital of Cairo last night
after talks with President Hosni Mubarak on the latest
development of the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations on Hebron.

<HEADLINE> Israel Labor Federation to Escalate Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Histadrut, Israeli
Labor Federation, plans to escalate its campaign of selective
strikes in different sectors today, after throwing Israel into
chaos Sunday with wildcat strikes in response to the arrest
of a labor leader.
</P>
<P>
According to an Israel Radio report, airports are to be
spared today, after 60 scheduled flights were disrupted due to
Sunday afternoon's sudden walkout, hot on the heels of a
strike last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The school system will also be unaffected today, and at 4
p.m. local time (1400GMT) the Histadrut top brass will meet
to decide where the strike action will hit Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Finance Minister Dan
Meridor lashed out at the Histadrut and accused it of
sponsoring a political campaign against the government.
</P>
<P>
The employers urged Netanyahu Sunday night to seek
back-to-work orders and threatened to withhold deductions from
employees' wages which constitute the chief source of income
for the Histadrut.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Histadrut decided to hold selective strikes
every day, starting last Thursday, to protest the government's
planned budget cuts, as well as its economic policy.
</P>
<P>
However, the spark which ostensibly led to the wildcat
action at midday Sunday was the detention of Histadrut Trade
Union Department Chairman Shlomo Shani, who had gone underground
over the weekend after the Tel Aviv Labor Court ruled him
in contempt.
</P>
<P>
This followed Shani's violation of an order to limit
Thursday's strikes in the ports and railroads system to three
hours, and he was picked up by police after he showed up
at a Haifa Chemicals demonstration, in northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Histadrut Chairman Amir Peretz immediately ordered employees in
all sectors of the economy to walk out over what he
charged was the first ever attempt in the country to
infringe upon the right to strike.
</P>
<P>
His call was heeded at the Ben-Gurion Airport, where it caused
chaos, at banks, the train system, radio and TV, and several
private plants.
</P>
<P>
This came on top of scheduled strikes by Electric
Cooperation employees, Bezeq, Israel's main communication firm,
and the ports, where the work stoppage is entering its
second week and causing great losses.
</P>
<P>
The wildcat side of the dispute ended some five hours
after it began, when the Tel Aviv Labor Court agreed to
let Shani go.

<HEADLINE> China to hold 5th Session of 8th NPC Next March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- A decision to hold the 5th
session of the 8th National People's Congress (NPC) in Beijing
next March was made here today at the closing ceremony of the 23rd
session of the 8th NPC's Standing Committee, China's top
legislature.
</P>
<P>
According to the decision, the agenda of the 5th session of the
8th NPC includes the following items: to hear and deliberate the
government work report; to examine and approve a report on the
enforcement of the Plan for National Economic and Social
Development in 1996; and to examine reports on the enforcement of
state and local budgets of 1996 and on the state budget of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The fifth session of the 8th NPC is scheduled to examine and
discuss the Amendment to the Criminal Law, the draft of the
National Defense Law, and issues concerning the number and
election of deputies to the Ninth National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
A proposal to establish Chongqing, an industrial center in
southwest China's Sichuan Province, into a municipality directly
under the central government, which was submitted by the State
Council, is scheduled to be deliberated during the 5th session of
the 8th NPC.
</P>
<P>
As is customary, the 5th session will also hear, examine and
deliberate work reports by the Standing Committee of the NPC, the
Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate.
</P>
<P>
The decision says that the 5th session of the 8th NPC is
scheduled to hear and discuss a report on the enforcement of the
Agriculture Law, the first of its kind in China. Experts believe
that law-enforcement inspection, as a means of legal supervision,
has become more mature and will play an increasingly important
role in the country.

<HEADLINE> Israel Terminates Foreign Workers' Work Permit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Some 120,000 foreign
workers' work permits in Israel are due to expire Tuesday,
because the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs will not
agree to their renewal, today's Jerusalem Post reported.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the Association of Contractors and Builders
as saying that the licenses were last extended in June, for
six months, one month before the licenses' original expiration
date.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry has not renewed foreign workers'
permits since November at the instruction of Labor and Social
Affairs Minister Eli Yishai, and as a result, almost all
workers in the construction and agriculture sectors will be
declared illegal.
</P>
<P>
"Within one night all of the foreign workers will become
illegal workers, and they will not be able to withdraw their
wages from the banks and may even decide to move to new
fields of activity," the association's vice president Shlomo
Heit said.
</P>
<P>
Amos Bar-Am, director-general of the association, said
thousands of workers who left the country to spend Christmas
with their families will not be allowed back into the
country.
</P>
<P>
A shortage of workers, he said, will make it very
difficult for contractors to continue their work and meet
building timetables, which will most likely cause a reduction
in the number of building startups and a shortage in
housing.
</P>
<P>
Labor and Social Affairs Ministry spokesman Zvi Rosen
confirmed that Yishai instructed the Interior Ministry not to
grant any new visas to foreign workers or to extend existing
visas until the ministry examines the relationships between
employers and foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
Rosen said the ministry has not completed its examination,
but heads of the Labor and Social Affairs Ministry, Interior
Ministry and the Employment Office are scheduled to meet this
morning to try to resolve the permit issue.

<HEADLINE> NPC Calls for Bigger Proportion of Female Deputies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The proportion of women
deputies in the National People's Congress (NPC) should be further
increased so as to protect women's political rights and ensure
their equal status with men, some members of the NPC standing
committee urged here today.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement, they pointed out that since the founding
of the People's Republic in 1949, women's status and rights have
been acknowledged and largely improved. Women are making great
contributions to the nation in every field, they said.
</P>
<P>
However, the proportion of female cadres is still on the low
side, they said, citing that the number of female deputies in the
NPC only account for about 21 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
The statements were made by NPC standing committee member Nie
Li and four other members.
</P>
<P>
They said that although the proportion of women in the NPC
membership ranks the 15th in the world compared with similar
foreign institutions, there are only 19 female members in the
standing committee, making up only about 12 percent of the total
number.
</P>
<P>
The statement pointed out that the amount is not in conformity
with the political rights stipulated in the constitution and laws
that women share the equal rights with men, and it cannot meet
China's advanced social system.
</P>
<P>
As a nationwide campaign is to be launched to elect the new
NPC, the country should adopt necessary measures to ensure that
the proportion of female deputies is higher than that of the
current conference, the committee members maintained.
</P>
<P>
They noted that an increase in the proportion of female
deputies serves as an important means to safeguard the
constitution and law, ensure women can be equal with men, and
realize China's commitment to the international community.
</P>
<P>
They said that the progress of women's rights has provided
conditions for them to participate in state affairs.
</P>
<P>
Since 1949, the opportunities for Chinese women to take part in
politics has been constantly improved. Additionally, since the
adoption of the NPC system 42 years ago, female deputies to the
NPC have played an important role in making laws and managing
social affairs.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of female deputies to the NPC has grown to 21.03
percent compared with 12 percent at the first NPC.
</P>
<P>
These deputies have paid particular attention to the issues of
public health, environment, the protection of the rights of women
and children, social security and culture and ethics, and have put
forward suggestions in these areas.
</P>
<P>
Many important laws were made because of female deputies'
proposals and participation.
</P>
<P>
The five members urged that a temporary special measure be
worked out to ensure that women enjoy equal rights with men, and
that the proportion of female deputies to the next NPC be
increased.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the NPC and local people's congresses should attach
more importance to the issue, the committee noted.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Returns Remains of Armed DPRK People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 30 (Xinhua) -- South Korea today returned the
remains of the 24 armed people of the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) killed or found dead in the submarine incident
last September.
</P>
<P>
The repatriation was conducted at the DPRK's request at the
truce village of Panmunjon this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Seoul agreed to return the remains of the DPRK people after
Pyongyang expressed deep regret on Sunday for the submarine
incident and promised to make efforts to ensure that such an
incident will not recur.
</P>
<P>
South Korea said that a total of 26 armed DPRK people
"infiltrated into" the country's Kangwon Province from a grounded
submarine in the East Sea (Sea of Japan) on September 18 this year.
</P>
<P>
Of the 26 DPRK people, one is still at large, while 13 were
shot dead by South Korean troops, 11 were found killed by their
colleagues and one was captured alive in a massive manhut in the
rugged mountains.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK said that the submarine, while on a training mission,
drifted after having an engine trouble and hitting a rock in the
sea.
</P>
<P>
However, Seoul claimed that the case of the intrusion was not
an "inadvertent incident that occurred during routine training" as
Pyongyang said, but was a "carefully premediated act of
Provocation."

<HEADLINE> Israeli Parliament Sets Deficit Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Finance Committee of
the Knesset (Israel's parliament) has approved a bill which will
set definite limits for the deficit in each of the next five
years, today's Jerusalem Post reported.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which is meant to give investors the message that
the Israeli government is serious about deficit reduction, now
will be sent back to the Knesset plenum for its second and third
readings.
</P>
<P>
However, it will have no real binding force even if passed,
since it can always be amended. This is what the previous
government did in 1994, when it saw it would not be able to meet
the targets specified in an earlier law.
</P>
<P>
According to the bill, the 1997 deficit will have to be no
greater than 2.8 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP),
and the limit will then decrease to 2.4 percent in 1998,
2 percent in 1999, 1.75 percent in 2000 and 1.5 percent in 2001.
</P>
<P>
These targets are considerably less ambitious than those
included in the original Deficit Reduction Law, passed by the
previous Likud government in 1992, which stipulated the deficit of
6.2 percent in 1992, 3.2 percent in 1993, 2.2 percent in 1994
and zero in 1995.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said it is more stringent than the
amended version passed by the previous Labor government in 1994,
since it sets specific targets for the deficit.
</P>
<P>
The Labor bill stated that the deficit would be 3 percent in
1994 and would decrease by unspecified amounts in each of the
three following years, but, the deficit hit 3.2 percent in 1995
and is expected to be some 3.8 percent this year.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's Current Account Deficit to Surpass $23 B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 30 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's current account
deficit is expected to exceed 23 billion U.S. dollars this year,
the Bank of Korea said here today.
</P>
<P>
The country's current account deficit in November was 1.87
billion U.S. dollars, bringing the cumulative total for the first
11 months of this year to 21.64 billion U.S. dollars, more than
twice the red-ink figure of 8.6 billion U.S. dollars recorded for
the same period last year, the central bank said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that lackluster exports due to labor strikes in
December will push up the current account deficit for the entire
year beyond the 23-billion-U.S.-dollar level.
</P>
<P>
The ever-growing current account deficit, accounting for 4
percent of the gross national product (GNP) in excess of the
country's sustainable level of 2 to 3 percent, may result in such
side effects as increased foreign debt and unemployment, a bank
official said.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the spiraling current account deficit
mainly to the poor performance of exports.
</P>
<P>
During the first 11 months of this year, South Korea's exports
totaled 117.97 billion U.S. dollars, while imports amounted to
136.61 billion U.S. dollars, for a deficit of 18.64 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the country's trade deficit stood at 10.06 billion
U.S. dollars, up 58.7 percent from the 6.34 billion U.S. dollars
registered in 1994.

Congress, China's top legislative body, today approved the
appointment of the new Minister in Charge of the Commission of
Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense.
</P>
<P>
Cao Gangchuan, a 61-year-old lieutenant general, was appointed
to the position by Premier Li Peng six days ago. An announcement

Liberation Army, majored in missile design at the Advanced
Military Engineering School of the Artillery Corps of the former
Soviet Union, from 1957 to 1963.

Director of the Military Affairs Department of the General Staff
Headquarters, and Director of the Military Trade Office under the
Central Military Commission.
</P>
<P>
In the appointment proposal endorsed by Premier Li, Cao was

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investment Speeds Up Economic Development in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Rapid economic growth in
China's economic powerhouse of Shanghai this year has been
attributed partly to overseas investment being raised rationally
and used with high-efficiency.
</P>
<P>
This year the city witnessed a rare higher economic growth, but
with the lowerest inflation rate since the founding of New
China in 1949, with the economic growth rate reaching 12.9 percent,
and per-capita GDP reaching nearly 2,700 US dollars during the
January-November period.
</P>
<P>
The first 11 months this year saw the city's retail sales top
100 billion yuan, with retail prices dropping nearly eight
percentage points compared with the same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The city has applied the bulk of overseas investments to local
industrial, urban construction, agricultural projects as well as
service trades, helping greatly improve the local restructuring of
the industrial structure.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 percent of local overseas-financed projects are
involved in large-scale and hi-tech industrial fields, such as
automobiles, electronics, computers, biological pharmaceuticals
and fine chemicals.
</P>
<P>
The city has given priority to hi-tech,
lower-energy-consumption projects, as well as projects with a high
added value, instead of the former labor-intensive and
high-energy-consumption sectors, with the output value of hi-tech
projects accounting for 12 percent of the local industrial total,
up from two percent of ten years ago.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the six leading industries, involving automobiles,
iron and steel, telecommunications, petrochemicals, household
appliances and power station equipment, have kept a growing
momentum, and generated half of the local total industrial output
value, helping the city form five industrial production bases in
Baoshan District, Jiading County, the Pudong New Area, the Minhang
Economic Development Zone and Jinshan Area.
</P>
<P>
The utilization of overseas investment has also given an
impetus to the development of local service trades, building
finance, insurance, real estate, telecommunications,
transportation, tourism to become new economic growth forces.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1990's, more than 190 overseas-funded financial
organizations and representative offices have been set up in
Shanghai, enabling the financial sector to grow at an annual rate
of 12.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade is expected to rise more than 10 percent this
year over 1996. Foreign-funded enterprises will contribute 87
percent to increased exports this year.
</P>
<P>
The inflow of overseas funds into urban construction has
given a greater boost to the improvement of the local investment
environment, helping to build the city into an international
commercial, financial and trade center in the near future.
</P>
<P>
During recent years, the city has undertaken 18,000
foreign-funded projects, with contracted overseas investment
surpassing 50 billion US dollars, greatly speeding up local
economic development.

<HEADLINE> Qian on Sino-EU Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Developing long-term and
stable cooperative relations between China and the European Union
not only serves the interest of both sides, but also will
contribute to world peace, stability and development.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen made the
comment today in an interview with Xinhua. He said that there have
been frequent high-level exchanges of visit between China and some
members of the European Union this year.
</P>
<P>
The EU is China's fourth largest trade partner, and one of the
country's main cooperative partners in the fields of investment
and technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that bilateral cooperation in scientific,
technological, cultural and educational fields has also been
expanded.
</P>
<P>
In December 1995, the European Commission approved a long-term
policy on Sino-European relations. One month ago, the commission
adopted a new Strategy towards China, which is more specific and
further stresses its comprehensive, independent and long-term
policy towards China, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
China welcomes all this, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, the two sides have different views on certain
questions, and there still exist some problems in their bilateral
ties which cannot be neglected, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
China hopes that the EU will cancel its trade protection
measures against China's exports, in order to benefit the smooth
development of bilateral trade, Qian noted.
</P>
<P>
As long as the two sides abide by the principles of mutual
respect, seeking common ground while reserving differences,
non-interference into each other's internal affairs and equality
and mutual benefit, China-EU relations can continue to grow
steadily, Qian said.

<P>
CANBERRA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Rising star Martina Hingis of
Switzerland made a flying start by beating Irina Spirlea in their
Hopman Cup tennis clash against Romania in Perth on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hingis, 16, met little trouble to defeat the 22-year-old
Spirlea 7-5, 6-2, in the women's singles on the second day of the
800,000 Australian dollar (640,000 U.S. dollars) eight-nation
mixed teams event.
</P>
<P>
But Switzerland, who finished runner-up last year, also
suffered a blow after Hingis' partner, Marc Rosset, was troubled
with back spasms.
</P>
<P>
Rosset, gold medalist in the Barcelona Olympic Games in 1992,
has ruled himself out of his scheduled men's singles clash with
Adrian Voinea.
</P>
<P>
However, the 26-year-old Rosset decided to try to partner
Hingis in the mixed doubles, keeping alive Switzerland's hopes of
winning the seven-day contest.

<HEADLINE> 15 Bandits Killed in Attack Against Cattle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen bandits were
reportedly shot dead by Kenyan security force in a counter attack
against armed cattle rustlers in the Suguta Valley in northern
Kenya, The Daily Nation reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Department of Defense sources as saying that
several AK-47 assault rifles and hundreds of cattles have been
recovered.
</P>
<P>
The security force was now widening their area of operation to
contain escaping of the cattle rustlers to other areas.
</P>
<P>
The security personnel have used 10 helicopters and light
tanks to comb the Suguta Valley and sealed off the whole area of
the valley to cut off any escape routes, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
The operation involves a combined force of the army,
paramilitary General Service Unit, regular and administrative
police.
</P>
<P>
Following the shooting down of an army helicopter by armed
bandits, in which a district commissioner and two army officers
were killed last Thursday, the combined force launched a counter
offensive against the bandits.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that about 600 cattle rustlers were holed up
in the valley which borders the Samburu and Turkana districts in
northern Kenya.

<HEADLINE> Guangxi People Discover Value of Sky-Blue Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The fortunes of the Beibu Gulf
area in southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region changed
the day that local people cast their eyes out towards the sky-blue
sea.
</P>
<P>
Just a few years ago the thoughts of the locals focussed on the
mountains, rivers and lake areas, and the farmlands. Whenever they
talked about their region they seldom paid any attention to the
beautiful sea bordering their region to the south.
</P>
<P>
The value of the sea was only realized after the central
authorities formed a plan in 1990 to develop the Beibu Gulf area
into the main passage to overseas for southwest China, which is
rich in natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Now the vocabularies of the local people are sprinkled with
words like gold, silver, sea and bay, all reflecting the growing
major tourism zones and buildings in the area.
</P>
<P>
Names like the Silver Beach Tourism Zone in Beihai city, the
Golden Bay Hotel in Qinzhou city, and the Golden Shore Hotel in
Fangcheng port, show distinctively the local people's awareness of
the surrounding sea.
</P>
<P>
Since the change in direction, Guangxi's traditional
industrial structure of focusing on agriculture has been gradually
changed into one spearheaded by the development of its seaports,
and based on the comprehensive development of industry, commerce
and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the number of the berths of the three main
ports in the area - Beihai, Fangcheng and Qinzhou - has risen from
ten to 68, handling more than ten million tons of cargo each year.
</P>
<P>
Its economic growth pattern has been shifting towards one
featured by co-operation with overseas businesses.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, the Beibu Gulf area has utilized
overseas investment worth about 1.5 billion US dollars, and more
than 8,000 overseas-funded businesses have been established there.
</P>
<P>
The area has scored an annual GDP growth rate over 20 percent
over the past few years, making it the fastest growing area in
Guangxi and all of southwest China. The sea has proved to be a
gold winner for the region.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Angola's Peace Process Goes in Depth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Yin Yongjian)
</P>
<P>
LUANDA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The warring parties in Angola
has made great achievements in procuring peace in the war-plagued
country in 19
 090he second year for the implementation of the
Lusaka Peace Accord.
</P>
<P>
The achievements are manifested mainly in the assembly of the
militiamen of the former rebel National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA), the handover of their weapons and
the formation of a new unified army.
</P>
<P>
UNITA began to assemble its men on November 20, 1995, the
first anniversary of the signing of the Lusaka Peace Accord. By
November 26 this year, UNITA soldiers assembled in 15 assembly
points set up acro ndependence of Angola (UNITA), the handover of their weapons and
the formation of a new unified army.
</P>
<P>
UNITA began to assemble its men on November 20, 1995, the
first anniversary of the signing of the Lusaka Peace Accord. By
November 26 this year, UNITA soldiers assembled in 15 assembly
points set up acro ndependence of Angola (UNITA), the handover of their weapons and
the formation of a new unified army.
</P>
<P>
UNITA began to assemble its men on November 20, 1995, the
first anniversary of the signin52,000 tons of ammunition, of which 1,500 tons
have been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, over 660 UNITA soldiers under the age of 18 have
been civilianized.
</P>
<P>
More than 18,080 former UNITA rebels have been enroled in the
unified Angolan army. Nine UNITA generals have arrived in the
capital of Luanda to take the posts of deputy defense minister,
deputy chief of the general staff of the armed forces and deputy
chief of staff of the army respectively.
</P>
<P>
Besides, a total of 539 war prisoners have been released by
the two warring factions, of which 369 are former UNITA rebels.
</P>
<P>
The military obstacles to the peace in Angola have been
removed on the whole and the peace process in the southern
African country will soon enter into the political stage, said
Blondin Beye, the United Nations Special Envoy in Angola, at a
meeting of the Angola Peace Joint Commission on November 21.
</P>
<P>
During the "political stage", the following political
issues will be solved -- the position of UNITA leader Jonas
Savimbi in the government, the establishment of local
governments, UNITA's admission into the parliament, and the
formation of a new government of national unity.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that the solution of these political
issues is as difficult as that of the military ones, and
Savimbi's position in the new government will be a thorny one.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government once came up with a proposal that the
UNITA chief be appointed the second vice-president of Angola, but
UNITA rejected it. UNITA proposed that Savimbi be appointed
Angola's opposition leader, which was rejected by the government.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations are being held between the two sides on this
critical issue, which, observers believe, might have influence on
the peace process in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Although there are many difficulties on the way forward, the
prospects of peace process in Angola are rosy, observers say.
</P>
<P>
Both Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and UNITA
leader Jonas Savimbi have expressed their will to solve the
problems of Angola by political means, instead of by war.
</P>
<P>
They believe that most of the outstanding issues will be
resolved before UNAVEM concludes its mission in February next
year. Peace process in Angola seems irrevocable.

<HEADLINE> Indian Phone Company Asks for Action Against U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 30 (Xinhua) -- India's Videsh Sanchar Nigam
ltd (VSNL), the state-owned local telephone monopoly service
provider for international calls, has demanded action against the
U.S.-based carriers like MCI and Sprint for promoting call-call
traffic from India, official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The VSNL and the U.S. telecom regulator Federation
Communications Commission (FCC) have had the bitter war of words
over the latter's call-back issue in the past. The VSNL has fired
off a missive to the Department of Telecommunications (DOT) in the
country demanding that strict measures should be taken if the U.S.
carriers do not stop abetting call-back traffic, estimated to be
as high as 100 million minutes of traffic of both incoming and
outgoing as against a total of 1.2 billion minutes that India
handles.
</P>
<P>
The VSNL's move is the latest rapier thrust in the battle with
the U.S. regulator that began with the FCC's controversial bid to
force a cutback in telecom rates the world over. In the letter to
the DOT, VSNL Chairman and managing director B.K. Syngal has asked
the department to inform the FCC that call-back services are
illegal in India. The VSNL has also urged the department to come
out with advertisements in the media declaring call-back services
illegal. Call-back services have been declared legal by the FCC.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the U.S. regulator had not accepted a letter from VSNL
on the issue since it does not recognize the Indian International
Telecom Services Provider as an official counterpart.
</P>
<P>
The call-back service is an option that enables local telephone
subscribers to take advantage of the low rates in countries like
the U.S. while putting through international calls.

DHAKA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
decided to bring some changes in the Securities and Exchange
Commission in a day or two, aiming to check mismanagement in this
regulatory body of capital market.
</P>
<P>
This was indicated at a meeting held on Sunday between Finance

<HEADLINE> Nepali Opposition Seeks Alternative to Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's main opposition is
working to avert possible fresh parliamentary elections by seeking
an alternative to the present three-party coalition government,
local newspapers said today.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist
Leninist, CPN-UML) are trying to work out an alternative to the
government, led by Sher Bahadur Deuba of the Nepali Congress (NC),
from fears that the government would call for mid-term elections
if it fails to win back majority support in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Deuba government only won minority support in the lower
house last week when a CPN-UML tabled no-trust motion was put to
the vote.
</P>
<P>
However, the motion was rejected by the 205-seat house as 101
MPs voted for and 84 MPs against it. It required a majority of 103
votes to pass under the Constitution of Nepal.
</P>
<P>
After his government survived the opposition challenge, Deuba
vowed that he would neither resign nor call for mid-term
elections.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said the government would seek a vote of
confidence in the next parliament session probably in February
1997.
</P>
<P>
A Supreme Court's verdict last year ruled out the possibility
of fresh elections if there is a possibility of an alternative
government in the house, the newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a four-day Central Committee meeting of the main
opposition party concluding here Sunday decided to stage a
one-month street demonstration program against the government in
14 major cities throughout the country next month.

Sino-Russian strategic and cooperative partnership, characterized
by non-alignment and non-confrontation, and which is not targeted
against any third party, serves the basic interests of both
countries.

Qian added during an interview with Xinhua that such a

well as throughout the world.

1996 has been a year for new comprehensive development between
the two countries, Qian said, pointing out that Russian President
Boris Yeltsin visited China last April and held friendly talks
with Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Qian said, the two presidents vowed to set up
a 21st century-oriented strategic and cooperative partnership
between their countries, based on equality and mutual trust.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Welcomes DPRK's Statement on Submarine Incident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Sunday welcomed an apology from the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea for a submarine incident, which occurred three
months ago.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK on Sunday expressed "deep regret" for the submarine
which ran aground off the South Korean coast in September, and
said it will "make efforts to ensure that such an incident will
not recur and will work with others for durable peace and
stability on the Korean Peninsula."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he was "pleased" with DPRK's promise to avoid such
kind of incidents in the future.
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased that Pyongyang has pledged to prevent the
recurrence of such an incident and has expressed its willingness
to work with others for durable peace and stability on the
peninsula," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The United States, on behalf of South Korea that demanded an
apology before improving relations with DPRK, has been negotiating
on the submarine issue with DPRK's envoys in New York ever since
the submarine incident took place.
</P>
<P>
Clinton hoped the DPRK's statement would possibly open the way
toward four-party talks on Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
"I hope discussions can now begin to move forward on the
four-party peace talks," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said
the United States would consider food aid to the DPRK if it
apologized, but there was no immediate word on that in Clinton's
statement.

been hindered due to Japan's wrong attitude towards its history of
aggression against China and its wrong position on Diaoyu Island.
</P>
<P>
The appropriate recognition and treatment of past acts against
China by the Japanese militarists has a strong bearing on the
political foundation of China-Japan ties, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Chinese side has always held that the
friendship between the peoples of the two countries should be
enhanced from generation to generation.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chinese foreign minister noted, it is necessary
for the Japanese to recognize and acknowledge that period of
history.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that not long ago, leaders of both countries held
important talks in Manila, and that China then hoped the Japanese
side would translate its commitment into action, in order to push
forward the sound, stable and sustained development of bilateral
relations.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said here today in an interview with
Xinhua that China is willing to work together with the United
States to improve bilateral ties, in keeping with the three
Sino-US communiques, during the second term of U.S. President Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that Sino-US relations have continued to relax and
stablize this year, after a period of turbulence and uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
There have also been opportunities for improving and advancing
their relations, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, Qian said, the two countries
experienced twists and turns, prompting the U.S. to debate its
policy towards China.
</P>
<P>
As a result, he continued, more and more U.S. personnel with
breadth of vision have realized the importance of US-China
relations, and advocated the improvement and development of mutual
ties.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government's policies toward the U.S., just as
promoted by Chinese President Jiang Zemin, remain to be: "to
intensify trust, reduce obstacles to progress, and enhance
cooperation and a non-confrontational attitude," Qian said.

STOCKHOLM, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Swedish people took a
passive attitude of joining the European Monetary Union (EMU),
according to a latest poll conducted by local newspaper Dagens
Nyheter (Daily News).
</P>
<P>
Forty-four percent of the 1,000 people in the poll published
today opposed Sweden's participation in the union while one-third
supported and another one-third still undecided.
</P>
<P>
More Swedish people took the passive attitude to the
participation than that in the October survey, in which 38 percent
of people opposed.
</P>
<P>
Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson said, in an article
carried today in the daily Svenska Dagbladet (Sweden Daily), that
debates on the issue should be held in the country. He was
concerned that if Sweden joins the union, it has to carry out
super national policy on taxes and other charges, which is against
Swedish people's wish.
</P>
<P>
Sweden has not yet decided to join the union among the first

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Syphilis, elephantiasis and
tuberculosis are three major diseases carried into Thailand by
illegal immigrants, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Health examinations conducted on more than 160,000 immigrant
workers registered at the Thai Labor and Social Welfare Ministry
in September-November 1996 showed a high rate of syphilis, a
sexually transmitted disease which indicates a risk of HIV/AIDS
infection, said Permanent Secretary of the Public Health Ministry
Vitura Sangsingkeo.
</P>
<P>
The health report, based on information from some 400 hospitals
in the country's 43 provinces declared as amnesty zones for
illegal workers, showed 843 cases of syphilis among the
immigrants, 514 of tuberculosis, 357 of elephantiasis, 58 of
malaria and two of leprosy.
</P>
<P>
Vitura said the Public Health Ministry is particularly worried
about the spread of elephantiasis and malaria in the country.
</P>
<P>
Although Thailand successfully controlled the spread of
elephantiasis several years ago, it could return as a major
communicable disease as it is carried by mosquitoes, Vitura said.
</P>
<P>
Malaria, which mainly infects people living in Thai provinces
neighboring Myanmar and Cambodia, is known for its resistance to
drugs, said Vitura.

<TEXT>
<P>
JARKARTA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The situation in Tasikmalaya
in West Java Province of Indonesia has returned to normal after a
mass riot last Thursday that killed at least four residents and
injured 15 others, the local press today quoted police as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Police and military officers continue to be on alert," a
police officer of the Tasikmalaya police district said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
By Sunday afternoon, police had detained 93 suspects for
allegedly engaging in destruction and burning, said the police.
</P>
<P>
"We are still probing the case to find out possible
masterminds," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Market and public transportation started operating since
Saturday as residents, students, youths and military officers
worked together to clean up the burned site, the police said.
</P>
<P>
The local government estimated the losses at more than 50
billion rupiah (about 21.8 million U.S. dollars) from the more
than 100 seriously damaged and burned buildings including
factories, churches, stores, banks, police stations, automobile
showrooms, vehicles and schools.
</P>
<P>
The local manpower office disclosed that at least 1,000 workers
would possibly be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
The riot started as a protest by thousands of Muslims against
alleged police mistreatment of three Muslim teachers in the town,
about 225 kilometers southeast of Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Religious Affairs Minister Tarmizi Taher expressed his regret
over the incident, calling it a social brutality containing
religious elements.
</P>
<P>
"It was not a religious conflict at first but a political and
power abuse," he said.
</P>
<P>
Quoting reports from the ministry's fact finding team, Taher
indicated that certain groups of people have made use of the
incident.

BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The living standard of the

</P>
<P>
The per-capita living expenses of urban households will

</P>
<P>
The per-capita net income of rural households will be 1,900

<P>
Another bumper harvest was recorded in grain production, and
the shortage in the supply of major farm produce was alleviated.

crops will be 21.9 million tons, down by 600,000 tons.

<HEADLINE> 1996 Sees China's Active Multi-faceted Diplomacy: Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, December 30 (Xinhua) -- China's active, multi-faceted
and multi-level diplomacy in 1996 has enhanced the country's
relations with the rest of the world, offering a positive
contribution to worldwide peace and development, Chinese
Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said in an interview
with Xinhua here today.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic endeavors, particularly the exchange of visits by
senior leaders, have reinforced the friendship and cooperation
between China and the developing countries, on the basis of the
Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, Qian pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The noticeable results of the diplomacy are partly manifested
in the positive development trend of the relations between China
and Western countries, and in the increasing, positive and
important role played by China in major international affairs,
Qian said. He cited in particular the establishment of the new
Asian-European relationship, the strengthening of economic and
technological cooperation in the Asian-Pacific region, and the
conclusion of the treaty on complete prohibition of nuclear
testing.
</P>
<P>
And the international community highly regards and appreciates
China's active involvement in global affairs, Qian added.
</P>
<P>
In its contacts with foreign countries, China has moved quickly
to forcefully counter-attack practices that infringe upon China's
sovereignty or intervene in China's internal affairs, Qian said,
thus effectively safeguarding the state sovereignty, territorial
integrity and national dignity.
</P>
<P>
The diplomatic achievements in the past year have also helped
create a more favorable international environment for the
country's modernization drive, and will help to guarantee the
stable transition of Hong Kong while promoting national
reunification, according to the vice-premier and foreign
minister.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: South Asia's Poverty Alleviation Gains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 30 (Xinhua) -- South Asia, where nearly
half of the world's poor people live, enhanced its
poverty-fighting efforts in 1996 by emphasizing social
mobilization and local people's involvement.
</P>
<P>
The year saw a new model project of poverty alleviation in the
region aimed at encouraging local participation and strengthening
coordination in the field among South Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The region, where more than 400 million people live in
destitution, is also a priority area on the poverty alleviation
agenda of the U.N. Development Program (UNDP), which launched a
full-scale poverty alleviation program in South Asia this year to
help fulfill the region's commitment to eradicating poverty by
2002.
</P>
<P>
Actually, the region's joint effort to overcome poverty started
in 1994, when its leaders met at a summit of the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) in Dhaka, Bangladesh,
and adopted a declaration pledging to eradicate poverty in the
region preferably by the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
Governments of the seven SAARC member countries -- Bangladesh,
Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka --
later reaffirmed their commitment to fighting against rampant
poverty by declaring 1995 as the "SAARC Year of Poverty
Eradication."
</P>
<P>
With the support of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia
and the Pacific (ESCAP) and the UNDP, the SAARC launched last June
a project called "SAARC Seven Sisters" with a view to contributing
to member countries' poverty-fighting efforts.
</P>
<P>
The project, launched as a follow-up to the past poverty
alleviation activities, selected six districts, one in each of the
seven SAARC countries excluding Bhutan, as models for improving
local organizations' involvement in poverty-fighting programs.
</P>
<P>
It also proposed the establishment of district-level forums in
these model districts on a trial basis to bring together all
parties involved in local poverty alleviation.
</P>
<P>
A sub-regional networking of these district-level forums is
expected under the project for sharing experiences and exchanging
information on poverty alleviation among the participating
countries, according to sources of the SAARC Secretariat in
Kathmandu.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the UNDP renewed its poverty alleviation
program in South Asia this year by providing a package assistance
of 1.3 million U.S. dollars to support the implementation of the
Dhaka Declaration on poverty eradication.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in 1994, the UNDP launched the South Asia Poverty
Alleviation Program with 800,000 dollars to provide the poor with
credit opportunities for income generation and skill development
in cooperation with the governments in the region.
</P>
<P>
A large number of people in South Asia, especially those living
in poverty-stricken rural areas, have benefited from these poverty
alleviation initiatives, SAARC officials said.

<HEADLINE> Special Economic Zone Becomes Video Recorder Exporter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Xiamen, a special economic zone
in Southeast China's Fujian Province, has exported 3,500 video
cassette recorders to the Philippines. The deal signals the
beginning of its role as an emerging electronics supplier for

The 3,500 VCRs manufactured by the Xiaxin Company Ltd., the
first joint venture established in Xiamen in 1985, passed a
quality appraisal by the Ministry of Electronics Industry last
April, and has proved to be of the same technical benchmark as
western products.
</P>
<P>
During the past eight months, Xiaxin had put seven VCR brands
onto the domestic markets, and sold 100,000 machines. Its products
are now the third best seller after Japanese-made Panasonic VCRs

BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Libraries in Beijing no longer
wait for readers and they are now going to their doorsteps.

In the service, book-carriers are used. One carrier can hold
nearly 3,000 books at a time. Librarians can work on the carrier,
which is very convenient to both readers and librarians.
</P>
<P>
Since the Chaoyang District Library in east Beijing began

have never worried about reading books, newspapers and magazines.
</P>
<P>
This service, welcomed by the residents, is called "mobile
library".
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Children and Youth Library has joined in the group,
providing books on literature and arts. More than 1,000 children
become its customers.
</P>
<P>
The library also delivers books to correction centers for
juvenile delinquents.
</P>
<P>
"The mobile library has provided many good books to us, and we
have learned how to behave rightly through reading," said a

<P>
WEIHAI, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Rongcheng, a coastal city in
east China's Shandong Province, has built the service trade into a
driving force behind local marine economic development.
</P>
<P>
With nearly 500 kilometers of coastline and 80 harbors, the
city has a favorable geographical condition to develop the service
sector including marine transportation and coastal tourism.
</P>

The city now has 21 cargo ships, with a total DWT of 36,500
tons, and it has opened eight shipping routes to Hong Kong, Macao,

</P>
<P>
During the January-November period this year, the island made
50 million yuan in profits from shipping services.

In addition, the city also attaches more importance to ocean
shipping of fresh marine products, with more than 100 ships for
the transportation trade.

<HEADLINE> Serbian Parliament Speaker on OSCE Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the Serbian
Parliament Dragan Tomic has said the report of the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe on Yugoslav political
disputes was preliminary.
</P>
<P>
"The report can be an information as well as a recommendation
but the OSCE cannot arbitrate and this has been confirmed by
Felipe Gonzalez who headed an OSCE delegation for a fact-finding
mission," Tanjug news agency quoted Tomic on Sunday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE delegation came to Belgrade on December 20 for a
two-day visit at the invitation of the Yugoslav government. It had
wide-range contacts with both Serbian government and opposition
parties to find out truth over the political crisis in Serbia, and
submitted a report to the OSCE chairman last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Tomic said the report stated three key facts: that the election
law in Yugoslavia and Serbia was coordinated with the OSCE
principles, that the victory of the leftist coalition at the
November elections was undisputable and that the opposition had
won the majority of votes in several towns and several town
municipalities.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian government annulled the local election results,
prompting the opposition, which claimed victory in the elections,
to hold daily demonstrations and protests in Belgrade and other
major cities over the past 40 days.
</P>
<P>
Tomic described as useful an initiative to hold a panel
discussion on the current political situation at the Republican
parliament, which would be broadcast live by Serbian radio and tv
and said that it would be natural for all Serbian parliamentary
parties to participate in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"This is the only true way, because everything else is not
good, everything else is not what we urge, and that is democracy
and the promotion of the multi-party life," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian parliament has worked for more than a year in the
absence of a number of opposition parties, which walked out
because the national television stopped broadcasting the sessions
live, Tomic explained.
</P>
<P>
However, this was only the excuse of the opposition for not
participating in parliament's work, he said. If parties sincerely
wish to fight for their programs, they can achieve this in
parliament instead of boycotting the parliament sessions.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav President Delivers National New Year Message </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Zoran
Lilic said Sunday his country's aims in 1997 were peaceful
economic prosperity, promotion of democracy, state of law, human
rights, and equal relations with the international community.
</P>
<P>
In the New Year's message to the nation, issued by the
presidential office, Lilic said peace in the neighborhood and the
lifting of the sanctions was not a gift from the other countries
but "fruit of our consistent peaceful policy, of which Yugoslavia
is a guarantor, and our pledge to the stabilization of political
circumstances in the Balkans and Europe and their overall
development."
</P>
<P>
Individual and group interests must never come above the
interests of the entire nation, above the reinforcement of a state
that has just emerged from a period of unseen foreign pressures,
said Lilic.
</P>
<P>
The president said Yugoslavia needed stable internal and
foreign conditions in order to work for economic recovery and
better living to row into a real national movement.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past month, political questions and differences in
opinion can be resolved successfully only where they are resolved
in all democratic, parliamentary and multi-party states -- in
institutions set up by the will of the people," he said, referring
to the opposition demonstrations in Belgrade and other major
cities throughout Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Opposition coalition Zajedno has staged protest rallies in the
past 40 days over the annulment of results of local elections in
which the opposition has claimed victory in most big cities in
Serbia, causing political crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that state organs had to execute their
constitutional and legal obligations more efficiently and without
delay.
</P>
<P>
"Whoever fails to do so must bear the consequences. It is the
right of the citizens of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to
live in a state without street and economic crime, and without
blackmail and corruption."
</P>
<P>
Lilic said it was imperative to democratically implement the
political program for peace, unity, economic recovery, social
justice, independence and equal inclusion into European and world
integration processes.
</P>
<P>
"There is enough room for everyone in such a Yugoslavia, for
members of all nations and national minorities, all religions,
political parties," Lilic said in the end of the message.
