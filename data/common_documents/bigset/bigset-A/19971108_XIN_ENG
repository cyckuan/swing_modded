Association.

<HEADLINE> Seven Million Canadians Struggle with Illiteracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Most Canadians can read and
write, but more than 40 percent don't have the literacy skills
needed to function well at work or at home, according to an
international adult literacy survey released today.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that Canada still ranks near the top of 12
countries participating in the study, and ranks first among the
English-speaking countries.
</P>
<P>
While Canadians are doing well in terms of tackling illiteracy,
"we can't overlook the fact that about seven million people here
still struggle with the written word," said Senator Joyce
Fairbairn, the government's special adviser on literacy.
</P>
<P>
Fairbairn said improved literacy skills are necessary if Canada
is going to keep pace with a rapidly changing workforce that
expects more and more expertise from workers.
</P>
<P>
The study makes it clear that literacy is no longer simply
defined as the ability to read and write, but more accurately, as
having the necessary abilities to adapt to changes in the
workplace, she said.
</P>
<P>
It showed that people with lower literacy skills in the country
are more than twice as likely as those with mid-range to high
literacy skills to be unemployed, she said.

<HEADLINE> Macedonia Seeks Extension of UNPREDEP Mandate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The Macedonian government wants
a continued presence of the United Nations Preventive Deployment
Force (UNPREDEP) in the former Yugoslav republic, say reports from
Skoplje, the capital of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Blagoj Handziski told reporters Thursday that
in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, he had asked for
an extension of UNPREDEP mandate for another 12 months after its
expiry date at the end of November.
</P>
<P>
The force, established in 1992, is to prevent conflicts
elsewhere in the former Yugoslavia from spreading into
Macedonia. It consists of 1,091 military personnel and 23 civilian
police, mainly from the United States and Finland.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council last November called for a phased
reduction of 300 soldiers from the operation to be completed by
last April 30. But on April 9, the council suspended the reduction
because of unrest in Albania.

COLOMBO, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga said here this evening that the country's economy has
been taking off and her government will continue to give priority
to export and attract investment.
</P>
<P>
She made the remarks while attending the inauguration ceremony
of the Expo'97 in Colombo, the third such event since 1992 when
Sri Lanka's first international fair was held.
</P>
<P>
She noted the 1998 budget of her government, which was
presented to the parliament on Wednesday, includes a package of
incentives that will help create an investment-friendly climate
for foreign and local investors.

<P>
She said since the People's Alliance assumed power in 1994, her
government has adopted many measures to establish a strong and
dynamic economy within the framework of free market.

<P>
Though "our efforts are meeting great success," she pointed
out, "we still have much to do to reach our objectives."

Over 300 local companies display an array of quality products
and services at the international trade fair which attracted more
than 2,000 foreign buyers from Western Europe, Asia and North
America.

Besides traditional export items such as tea, rubber and
coconut, the country now is able to display a wide range of export
commodities ranging from agricultural products, textile,

<HEADLINE> Iran Ready to Resume Ties with Egypt: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Iran is all set to resume
diplomatic relations with Egypt, but on a condition that Egypt's
views concur with that of Iran on Israeli regime and the talks
on the Middle East peace, a senior Iranian official said today.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister for Arab-African Affairs
Seyyed Mohammad Sadr made the remarks in an interview with the
Beirut-based Arabic daily al-Hayat today, Iran's official news
agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that due to the current sensitive
circumstances, Egypt and Iran would be able to build a closer
tie, adding that Iranian officials look to Egypt as an important
Islamic Arab country and as the seat of Islamic culture.
</P>
<P>
Tehran and Cairo broke off their diplomatic ties after Egypt
signed the David Camp Accord with Israel in 1979, but relations
have been warmed up in recent years, particularly in the fields
of economic and scientific cooperations.
</P>
<P>
Former Iranian foreign minister Ali Akbar Velayati visited
Cairo last May to invite Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to
attend the forthcoming summit of the Organization of Islamic
Conference (OIC).
</P>
<P>
Media reports said that Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa had voiced Mubarak's willingness to attend the OIC summit.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak also expressed hope that Cairo and Tehran would enjoy
military cooperation with each other in a bit to confront the
threat from the Israeli-Turkish military accord, the
reports said.

<HEADLINE> ILO Discusses Proposal for Declaration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The Governing Body of the
International Labor Organization (ILO) is discussing a proposal
for a declaration on fundamental rights at its 270th session,
according to an ILO press release here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting on November 6-20, the ILO Governing Body
will decide whether to place on the agenda of the next
International Labor Conference the proposal concerning the
possible consideration and adoption of a solemn declaration on
fundamental rights, including a follow-up mechanism.
</P>
<P>
The ILO declaration under discussion is supposed to seek to
reaffirm the meaning and scope of the commitments to which all ILO
members have subscribed when freely accepting, upon their
admission, the ILO constitution enshrining the fundamental values
and principles which have been developed in the seven "core"
Conventions of the ILO relating to fundamental rights.
</P>
<P>
These fundamental rights concern the prohibition of forced
labor and of child labor, freedom of association and the right to
organize and bargain collectively, equal remuneration for men and
women for work of equal value, and non-discrimination in
employment.
</P>
<P>
During the current meeting, the ILO Governing Body will also
discuss other aspects of the follow-up to the discussions of the
Director-General's report to the 1997 International Labor
Conference, on the ILO Standard Setting and Globalization, as well
as a number of other issues.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, since the incumbent ILO head, Michel Hansenne, has
announced that he will not be seeking a third five-year term when
his current term of office comes to an end in March 1999, the
Governing Body will also be called upon to set the timetable and
agree on the procedures for the election of the next ILO head.
</P>
<P>
The Governing Body will make a decision at which meeting of the
Governing Body, in next March or next November, that a new
director-general should be elected.
</P>
<P>
There are now two potential candidates for the post. One is
Juan Somavia, Chilean Ambassador to the United Nations in New
York. Somavia is at present President of the UN Security Council.
The other is the former labor minister of the Philippines, Nieves
Confesor.

environment, regional and global cooperation is essential," he
said, urging each country and region to participate in formulating
and implementating sound environmental policies established by
multilateral agreements.

Environmental problems are no longer just the concern of any
one nation, because they do not stop at national boundaries, he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the United Nations, about five million people die
each year of diseases caused by unsafe drinking water.
Approximately 80 to 90 percent of all diseases, and more than one
third of all deaths in developing countries, are considered

President Ramos called on the Filipinos to conserve and recycle
water at a time when the country is experiencing the ill-effects

Blair said: "Of course we made it very clear that we want to

can come home."
</P>
<P>
"Of course there is also the important question of
compensation, which we raised not merely in respect of this
dispute but last year's too," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, French Prime Minister Jospin promised
that British transport companies would soon know if they were to
be compensated for losses suffered in the French truckers' strike.
</P>
<P>
Jospin made it clear that all claims for compensation from
British haulage firms must be properly submitted.
</P>
<P>
"I can say that all those companies that have lodged papers and
documentation in conformity with the French requirements will be
given a reply within three months."
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of British truckers have been caught up in the
wide-spread French strike and British Freight Transport
Association claimed that the strike was costing British truckers
an estimated one million pounds (about 1.7 million U.S. dollars)
each day.

<HEADLINE> Optimal Utilization of Water Resources Urged in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Energy and Water
Development Minister Suresh Desai said here on Tuesday that
planning for optimal utilization of scarce water resources must
be at the core of SADC's plan for regional integration and
socio-economic development.
</P>
<P>
Opening a two-day workshop on the preparation of the "Zambia
water sector country situation report (SCR)" for the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) round-table conference
scheduled for next year, Desai expressed concern that so much
water is running off to the sea every year, and a lot more is
being lost through silting of rivers and dams while very little
is being done to harness, store and conserve the water.
</P>
<P>
"Given the vulnerability of SADC members to water related
shocks, planning for optimal utilization of scarce water
resources must be at the core of SADC's plans for regional
integration and socio-economic development.
</P>
<P>
There is potentially much to be gained from greater regional
cooperation in this respect. However, such cooperation must
proceed from a clear understanding of available water resources
and its future requirements for power production, human
consumption, environment, agriculture, mining, and industrial
production," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
CSR coordinator Patrick Chipungu said at the workshop that the
southern African region is experiencing wide variations and
fluctuations in distribution of rainfall with many areas
suffering periodic droughts.
</P>
<P>
Chipungu said CSR is going to analyze quantitative aspects of
water resources in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The CSR is a SADC assignment, and each member state is
required to produce a report on its water sector.
</P>
<P>
The reports will form the base for a regional strategy to be
presented to the donor community at the round table conference to
solicit financial support.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Vows to Take Action against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Defense Secretary William
Cohen on Friday repeated his Thursday's warning that "some action
has to be taken" against Iraq for its refusal to comply with U.N.
Security Council's resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"We await the U.N. inspector team to return to New York and
file its report, but I think clearly some action has to be
taken," Cohen said in an interview with ABC's "Good Morning
America" program.
</P>
<P>
A three-man U.N. team is expected to be back in New York late
on Friday. Before leaving Baghdad, Lakhdar Brahimi, one of the
three U.N. envoys, told a news conference that the Iraqis had
not informed the mission of any decision to lift the bar on
American participation in the U.N. weapons inspections teams
responsible for the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said he was awaiting a report from the three-man U.N.
team before making any decision on how to proceed against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. has to make a decision as to whether or not it
would seek to pursue greater economic sanctions against Saddam
Hussein or indeed consider authorizing military action," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"So we want to give that opportunity to the U.N. to at least
make that decision. Hopefully the United Nations will move on
this rather quickly," he added.
</P>
<P>
Cohen also accused Iraq of trying to drive a wedge between
the United States and the United Nations. "It's clear that
Saddam Hussein is seeking to divide the U.N. from the U.S. and
there should be no division," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz accused the
United States of dominating the U.N. weapons inspection teams, the
U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM).
</P>
<P>
"The Special Commission is supposed to be a United nations
organ. That means an international organ ... actually, it has
been an American organ," Aziz said at a news conference in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
"That is unacceptable, that is not United Nations business,
that is one superpower's business... UNSCOM is being used as a
means and a cover," he said.

<HEADLINE> Total Number of UK Smokers up after 25-Year Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The proportion of people in
Britain who smoke shows the first increase after 25 years of
decline, with growing numbers of female picking up the habit,
according to an official survey today.
</P>
<P>
The annual Household Survey for 1996, published by the Office
for National Statistics, said that there had been a steady fall in
smoking since 1972, when 52 percent of men and 41 percent of women
said they were smokers.
</P>
<P>
However, the survey for 1996 found that the figures on smoking
are up from 28 to 29 percent among men and 26 to 28 percent among
women.
</P>
<P>
The survey of some 9,000 households said that after decades in
which smoking was mainly a male habit, smoking among women is on
the increase and they set to become the biggest cigarette
consumers as the survey put them only one percentage point behind
men.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it also showed that teenage girls are already
smoking more than teenage boys, 32 percent of girls compared with
26 percent of boys in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Doctor O'Neill, scientific adviser to the British Medical
Association, said: "This shows the importance of looking carefully
at the effectiveness of health promotion campaigns and providing
more support to those people who want to stop smoking but are
finding it difficult."

<HEADLINE> Dam Site Permeated with Festivity on Eve of Damming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING (Three Gorges), November 7 (Xinhua) -- The Three
Gorges Project site here was in a festive atmosphere on the eve of
the blocking of the Yangtze, which marks the completion of the
first-phase project of the world's biggest water control endeavor.
</P>
<P>
In the spacious wildness of the night, the Yangtze looked
peaceful and serene. Tourist boats, hydrofoils and other ships
were sailing on the newly-opened diversion channel, built to
handle traffic when the river is dammed.
</P>
<P>
The ship of the damming headquarters was anchored 200 m from
the upstream cofferdam. Aboard the ship, principal director in
charge of damming process Qiao Shengxiang said,"the facilities are
are available and in good shape, and this is the most relaxed
moment for us since the damming began in October, 1996." Fourteen
computers installed in the ship will come to their aid during the
course of blocking tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
A hydrologic survey ship named after the Great Yu, the much
revered flood hero in ancient times, was anchored 100 m from the
upstream cofferdam. Tomorrow, the ship will transmit to the
headquarters changing hydrologic data such as those related to
the discharge, flow speed and drop in the water surface.
</P>
<P>
At the worksite, over 430 loaders, dump trucks, and bulldozers
to be used for the blocking were in the lot and more than one
million cu m of rocks and gravels kept in reserve.
</P>
<P>
Tourists flocked to the Tanzilin hill-top, the highest area at
the worksite, as well as a 185-m-tall platform beside the site for
the future dam, which is also an ideal spot to have a bird-eye's
view of the worksite.
</P>
<P>
In Yichang city, some 40 km from the worksite, the streets were
adorned with flowers, while buildings decorated with colored lamps
and neon lights.
</P>
<P>
With regard to tomorrow's river blockage, Tian Zhenya,
secretary of the city Party committee, said, "the construction of
the Three Gorges project has brought Yichang a rare chance for
development."
</P>
<P>
"The river damming tomorrow will mark the accomplishment of the
first-phase project, which is a milestone in its construction,"
said Lu Youmei, general manager of China Three Gorges Project
Investment Corp., the project's proprietor.

<HEADLINE> Mediamen Urged to Actively Participate in Polio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian mediamen today
were called to actively participate in the nation-wide polio
immunization campaign due to take place next week by
communicating the dates and purposes of the campaign to the
public.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by Tsehaye Debalkew, general manager of mass
media training center at a one-day workshop held here under the
theme of "the role of mediamen in the realization of the polio
immunization campaign".
</P>
<P>
Tsehaye said the regular polio inoculation programs do not
suffice to the entire eradication of the disease from the
country.
</P>
<P>
He also said the mediamen are morally and professionally bound
to persistently sensitize their audiences to have their children
vaccinated against poliomyelities.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the workshop, representative of the world health
organization Bernard Morinier said that polio vaccine will be
administered to 8.5 million children under the age of five at
25,000 vaccination posts set up throughout Ethiopia and about
75,000 health professionals and volunteers have been deployed to
accomplish the immunization campaign.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has plans to eradicate polio by 2000. The nation will
embark on its first nation-wide immunization drive against polio
on November 14-16 targeting 8.5 million children under the age of
five. The second round of the campaign will be carried out one
month later.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak: Arab Summit Essential for Arab Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak said today in Bahrain that his country has no opposition
to a special Arab summit, saying such a convention is "essential
for Arab unity."
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Bahrain's official Khaleej
News Agency, Mubarak said that there are "sufficient reasons" for
holding the special gathering if Arab countries wish that.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt has no opposition on the special summit. The issue is
essential for Arab unity," he told the agency before winding up a
brief visit to the Gulf state.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain is the last leg of his current tour to the Gulf region
which has taken him to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Oman.
</P>
<P>
During his visits, he discussed with these countries' leaders
the latest developments in the Middle East region, including the
upcoming Middle East and North Africa economic conference which has
divided the Arab world due to Israel's participation.
</P>
<P>
The conference to be held in the Qatari capital of Doha on
November 16-18 was boycotted by some Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Bahrain have not yet voiced their stand. However,
Mubarak said earlier this month during his visit to the UAE that
the Doha conference was meaningless because of the current
deadlock in the Arab-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak expressed the hope that the United States would make
use of its "particular and good" relations with Israel to pull the
Jewish country back on peace track.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process has been stalled for eight
months since Israel began construction of a controversial Jewish
settlement in Arab East Jerusalem in March.

LONDON, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Visiting French President
Jacques Chirac has called on the Iraqi government to obey and
fully implement the United Nations Security Council Resolutions
concerned.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government has banned American experts from taking
part in U.N. arms inspections in Iraq in protest against a
threatened toughening of the U.N. sanctions upon Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after an Anglo-French summit in
London, President Chirac said the French government was
traditionally against "brutal methods, particularly recourse to
force or to sanctions".
</P>
<P>
However, Chirac explained: "In the particular case of Iraq, it
is obvious that Iraq must first and foremost respect the
commitments it has made."
</P>
<P>
"There are resolutions which were adopted by the U.N. Security
Council and these resolutions, in the current state of affairs,
must be applied in full and we will see," he added.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Iraqi government officials have accused
some UN inspectors of undertaking espionage activities on behalf
of the United States.

<HEADLINE> Army Chief of Somali Clan Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Colonel Sharif Hassan
Jumale, chief of staff of Hussein Mohamed Aidid's armed forces
was shot dead today by armed gunmen at strong point K-7 south of
the Somali capital.
</P>
<P>
Jumale, also known as Sharif Gesaweyne was shot dead along
with one of his staff members on board his car.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said, Sharif Gesaweyne was on his way to a
religious gathering near K-7 after saying his Friday prayers. The
gunmen who killed the colonel did not loot his car, and the
bodies of the colonel and his bodyguard were transported to Sey
Biano for burial under the care of his clan relatives.
</P>
<P>
No reason was given for the killing of Gesaweyne. However the
killing was attributed to the recent retaliatory assassinations
within some subclans of Habar Gidir loyal to Hussein Aidid.
Gesaweyne was the third colonel being killed by gunmen in the
past three days in Baidoa and Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The other two killed in separate attacks were Khalif Gurei
Dhunkal, head of Hussein Aidid's special security unit and a top
militia commander, and Hashi Sangal.
</P>
<P>
The death of Gesaweyne, a close relative of Osman Ali Atto,
who supported Hussein Aidid politically, has added to the tension
that already persisted in the southern part of the Somali capital
since the killing of the two late colonels.
</P>
<P>
Elders from other subclans of Habar Gidir have been moving
around in an effort to stop further killings and retaliatory
attacks. Aqil Ahmed Rage, a well known elder of Habar Gidir, has
issued a statement calling on the people to stop the renewed
hostility and open dialogues.

BANGKOK, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) and the International Labor Organization (ILO) are
collaborating to provide technical assistance to boost cooperation
in employment and exchanges of skilled personnel among the
countries in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS).
</P>
<P>
"The first aim of the assistance is to establish the groundwork
for a subregional network for the exchange of labor market
information," according to a press release from the ILO regional
office for Asia and the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
"The second objective is to make it easier for a GMS country to
recognize and understand the content and level training offered in
other GMS countries through the development of uniform skill and
certification standards for 'key occupations'," the release said.
</P>
<P>
"The project will also develop evaluation and accreditation
criteria to be applied to training institutions which might be
selected as potential subregional centers of excellence," it said.
</P>
<P>
The assistance is part of the action plans for the further
expansion of subregional labor information exchange and quality
assurance in technical and vocational training, which were
endorsed by ministers and senior officials from Cambodia, China,
Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam as well as ADB and ILO
officials who met early this week in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
At their meetings, ADB and ILO officials stressed the
importance of human resource development throughout Asia and the
Pacific.

ISLAMABAD, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Commerce Minister

trade rules and regulations to promote bilateral trade among
member countries of the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a training workshop organized by the Associated

News Agencies, Dar said the volume of trade among ECO countries
was relatively small as compared to trade by these countries with
non-members.

"Pakistan had just half billion dollars of trade with ECO
countries during 1996-97," Dar said. He called upon the Pakistanis
to boost trade with the Central Asian countries on priority basis.
</P>

He observed that the 10 ECO member countries with a population
of over 300 million have great potential in the future provided
they fully exploit their natural resources with mutual cooperation
and understanding.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin on His Forthcoming Visit to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 7 (xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
announced here today that an important joint statement concerning
demarcation of the Russia-Chinese border will be made during his
forthcoming visit to China.
</P>
<P>
Meeting reporters on the eve of his official visit to China
scheduled for November 9, Yeltsin said the task of the two
nations' leaders is "to settle the problem of demarcation
completely", and the basis for the settlement includes
consultations, mutual understanding and mutual concessions.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin emphasized that a successful settlement of border
disputes makes an important contribution to the cause of peace,
stability and prosperity of border areas, to stronger friendship
and good-neighbourly relations between Russia and China as well as
to maintenance of regional peace.
</P>
<P>
In reply to the question about the development of
Russian-Chinese relations, Yeltsin said that Russia and China
created the equal and trustworthy partnership aimed at strategic
cooperation in the 21st century in April 1990.
</P>
<P>
"Our common achievement over the past years is a high level of
trust and an intensive dialogue, above all, at the summit level.
We firmly intend to develop it," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin stressed that good-neighbourly relations and
cooperation with China are an independent foreign policy of
Russia. It is of long-term and strategic nature and is not subject
to political time-serving considerations.
</P>
<P>
He continued that bilateral relations have covered a very long
road since the first summit of the Russian and Chinese leaders in
1992. The mechanism of regular meetings of the heads of government
of the two countries works well.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said that the two states do not want to and will not
stop at what they have accomplished. "We firmly intend to
consolidate our relations and to master new spheres of
cooperation. This is one of the aims of my coming visit." More

<HEADLINE> Pak to Attract 5 Billion Dollars of Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government is
hoping to have an inflow of 5 billion U.S. dollars of foreign
investment over the next four years as a result of its economic
reforms, Commerce Minister Muhammad Ishaq Dar said here today.
</P>
<P>
"It's a very conservative estimate," Dar told a press
conference after the conclusion of an International Conference on
Privatization and Project Financing in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference, which was organized by the Board of
Investment and attended by participants including 80 from abroad,
was very successful, Dar said.
</P>
<P>
He said the conference was intended to inform potential
investors about the Pakistani government's economic policies and
investment potential in the country.
</P>
<P>
Previously, only the manufacturing sector was opened to foreign
investors, Dar said, but now the government has broaden it
tremendously.
</P>
<P>
"As we announced, the new areas have been opened up for the
foreign investors including real estate, health, education,
infrastructure and communication," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister acknowledged there were difficulties and
impediments in attracting foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
However, "we are trying to overcome them," he added.

<HEADLINE> Blair Wins French Support over European Bank Seat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 7 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair said here today that he has won the crucial support of the
French government over London's seat on the executive board of the
future European Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
Blair told reporters after the annual Anglo-French summit in
London that Britain has actually secured a seat of the future
European Central Bank if it joins the single European currency in
the future.
</P>
<P>
"I think there is a broad measure of agreement that should
Britain join the euro currency there will be a place for Britain
on the executive of the bank and that is a very important step
forward," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, who was
reportedly reluctant to give Britain the bank seat, said that
France would back Britain's claim for a seat if there were no
technical barriers standing in the way.
</P>
<P>
"Our position is to say as soon as Great Britain joins the
euro, it will have a place on the board," Jospin said.
</P>
<P>
However, on the eve of today's summit a senior French
government minister said that Paris believed it is hard to imagine
giving seats on the European Central Bank countries that had not
joined the single currency.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Labor government has made it clear that Britain would
not sign up to the first-wave membership of the European Monetary
Union due to be launched on January 1 1999.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Calls on PNA for Final-Status Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu today called on the Palestinian side to enter
the final-status talks to achieve the final peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the remarks while addressing a delegation of
Reform and Conservative Jews from the United States, who visited
Israel to discuss the conversion dispute with Oxthodox Jews here.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli prime minister urged the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) to follow up the just-concluded peace
negotiations held in Washington between Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy and PNA deputy head Mamoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) by
agreeing to his proposal.
</P>
<P>
No tangible achievements were made in the talks, but
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is expected to hold a
meeting with Netanyahu next week, probably in London when
Netanyahu visits Britain.
</P>
<P>
Asked how he would respond if Albright will request him to
agree to a time-out of Israeli settlement activities, Netanyahu
denied that Israel is violating the Oslo accords by expanding
the settlements.
</P>
<P>
"I think the idea of a time-out can't be a unilateral Israeli
exercise. We have a path toward the final settlement under the
charter of the accords. It does not include any limitations
whatsoever on settlements," he said.
</P>
<P>
He charged the PNA for failing to honor its part of
obligations in the Oslo accords, indicating that it should have
no right to ask Israel to limit the settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
"If Israel is asked to undertake limitations on settlements,
we must ask what limitations the Palestinian side undertakes for
itself," Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
He asked the PNA to honor its part of the Oslo commitments by
fighting terrorism. "We're keeping our side of the accords, they
are not. The first thing we want to see is they keep their side of
the accords beginning with the battle against terrorism,
systematic efforts against terrorism, which they have not waged,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The settlement issue, together with Israeli delay in further
troop redeployments in the West Bank, are the leading obstacles
blocking progress in the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Under the signed accords, Israel should have completed the
first two stages of the three-phase further troop redeployments
by early September this year. But Israel has delayed the
pullouts due to the dispute over the scope of the redeployments
with the PNA.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has been proposing taking the peace talks to the
fast-track of holding the final-status talks in order to bypass
the interim stage and reach a package deal on the final
settlement. The PNA has rejected the idea, describing it as an
Israeli plot to evade its commitments to the interim accords.
</P>
<P>
The final-status talks, which deal with the most difficult
and sensitive issues of Jerusalem, final borders and Palestinian
refugees, began in early May, 1996, between the PNA and former
Israeli Labor government, but have been delayed after Netanyahu
came to power in June last year.

<HEADLINE> French Union, Employers of Trucking Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The French Union of Confederation
Francaise Democratique du Travail (CFDT), which controlled
three-fourth of the highway barriers in the strike by lorry
drivers this week, today signed a protocol with the biggest group
of owners of trucking companies, the Union of Federations of
Transport (UFT).
</P>
<P>
The protocol was also signed by smaller unions of lorry drivers
and smaller trucking company owners, but boycotted by other unions
including the Force Ouvriere (FO), Confederation Generale du
Travail (CGT), and the Confederation Francaise des Travailleurs
Chretiens (CFTC), which considered the concession by UFT
inadequate.
</P>
<P>
A large majority -- 61.73 percent -- of the strikers of CFDT
present at the barriers approved the protocol, allowing the CFDT
leadership to sign the agreement.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the employers of trucking companies
will raise by 4-6 percent of the salaries of the truckers
immediately, raise salary of truckers to 10,000 francs for each
month with 200 working hours, and guarantee minimum salaries for
the truckers.
</P>
<P>
Militants belonging to the CFDT today lifted some of the
barriers they erected on highways, including those at the port
zone of Lesquin and Calais in the north bordering the English
Channel, as well as on the highways linking to the bridges of
Brotonne, Tancarville and Normandie, said the national center of
highway information (CNIR).
</P>
<P>
In the Rhone region in the south, all the barriers, especially
those blocking the refinery center in Feysin, have been lifted,
while the strikers stopped their movement on the highways of
Alpes-Isere, Savoie and Haute-Savoie in the eastern part of the
country.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Reaffirms Hostility Toward Brutal Methods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 7 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today reaffirmed his hostility toward any "brutal" method to force
Iraq to cooperate with the United Nations in armaments, such as
military action and economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
"France is not, in principle, favorable to brutal methods, in
particular the resort to force or sanctions," Agence France-Presse
quoted Chirac as saying in London where he is attending the
Franco-British summit.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that on the other hand, Iraq should respect its
engagements with the United Nations in disarmament inspections.
</P>
<P>
"In the particular case of Iraq, it is evident that Iraq
should, first and above all, respect the engagements it has
taken," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the French Foreign Ministry today refused to confirm
or deny a report that Iraqi Vice Prime Minister Tarek Aziz will
visit Paris next week, before going to New York to hold talks with
United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan on the on-going crisis
between Iraq and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council will meet Monday to discuss
a report to be submitted by a U.N. mission in Baghdad this week.
</P>
<P>
The present crisis came after Iraq ordered the expulsion of all
Americans from the special commission of the United Nations in
charge of supervising disarmament in Iraq (UNSCOM) two weeks ago,
in retaliation against a U.S.-proposed U.N. resolution which
hardened sanctions against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> OECD Says Impact of Southeast Asia Financial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) said today that the impact of
the financial crisis in Southeast Asian countries on the growth of
its 29 member countries will be limited.
</P>
<P>
Ignazio Visco, the chief of the OECD Economic Department, said
that the impact of the crisis on growth in Europe and the United
States will be from 0.1 percent to 0.2 percent this year and next
year, and double of that in Japan, mainly due to the latter's
exports to Southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that the impact of the crisis on Europe is not
"substantial" and would not jeopardize the efforts by European
Union countries to realize the European single currency.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth rate of OECD countries is expected to stand
at 3 percent this year and next year, with little or no
acceleration of inflation, said Janet Yellen, chief of the
economic advisors of the White House of the United States at a
press conference organized by OECD.
</P>
<P>
She said that Japan is considered an exception to "the
favorable perspective" of OECD countries, with its growth stagnant
and being subjected to the impact of the crisis in Southeast Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that the perspective for Southeast Asian
countries "in the medium terms" are "favorable enough," as long as
they can achieve necessary structural reforms.

JERUSALEM, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu gave his testimony today to the State Inquiry
Committee over the failed assassination of a Hamas leader in
Amman, Jordan in September, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
In today's testimony, Netanyahu defended his role as the
prime minister in handling this matter and the issues connected
with the state security.
</P>
<P>
The botched murder attempt on Khaled Mashaal, political leader
of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), by two Israeli agents
in Amman on September 25, has damaged the relationship between
Israel and Jordan, one of the two Arab countries that have signed
peace treaty with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Following the incident, Israeli opposition parties and mass
media criticized Netanyahu for authorizing such an operation in
such a friendly country, asking him to resign.
</P>
<P>
The Netanyahu government set up a three-member committee to
inquire this incident shortly after the failed attempt which also
forced Israel to release Hamas spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed
Yassin in exchange for the return of the two Israeli agents who
were caught red-handed by Jordanian police.

contains numerous Israeli subsystems, is the most advanced plane
in production. The fighter is based on the dual engine F-15E,
which destroyed virtually all the planes lost by Iraq in the
1991 Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
The F-15I is reportedly meant to perform long-range missions
as far as Iran, Iraq and Libya, and would strengthen Israel's
deterrence in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Israeli Air Force (IAF) has invited
Boeing and its chief rival, Lockheed Martin, to compete for the
supply of an additional 25 such planes for its next
squadron. Boeing is the main contractor of the F-15I fighters.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Ministry
Deputy Undersecretary Inal Batu said here today that he would
leave soon for Russia for Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Batu said that he would go to Moscow on November 17 to make
contacts with Russia regarding the 150-kilometer-range
anti-aircraft S-300 missiles which the Cypriot government has
planned to buy from Russia.
</P>
<P>
He said that United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan's
special representative to Cyprus Diego Cordovez is expected to
visit Cyprus on November 18 and come to Turkey on November 24 to
exchange views with Turkish officials on the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been concerned about Russia's plan to sell the
Russian-made S-300 missiles to Cyprus. The Turkish military has
repeatedly threatened that it will destroy these missiles if
they are finally deployed in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot South and Turkish
Cypriot North since 1974 when Turkey landed its troops and took
over the northern third of the Mediterranean island following a
short-lived pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared in 1983 a breakaway "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus", which was recognized only by
Turkey. Turkey maintains 35,000 troops on the island.

<P>
Asked about the trade and economic relations between Russia and
China, the Russian President said that the level of development of
these relations is not commensurate so far either with
potentialities of the two states, or the nature of the political
relations.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said that it is necessary to speed up establishment of
an adequate infrastructure for economic cooperation at the state
level.
</P>
<P>
The two sides should ensure efficient protection of the rights
of intellectual property, legal rights and interests of
participants in foreign economic operations, the president said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Russia and China should implement joint big
projects -- construction in China of gas pipelines from the
Irkutsk Region and Western Siberia, deliveries of electricity from
Eastern Siberia and construction of a nuclear power plant with
powerful reactors in eastern China.
</P>
<P>
The two countries should stimulate bilateral trade in every
way, including switch over from simple merchandise deals to mutual
investments and production cooperation, he added.
</P>
<P>
Russian-Chinese trade is based on market principles, and the
state cannot force Russian and Chinese businessmen to cooperate
with one another. However, state bodies are duty-bound to create a
favourable climate for business contacts, Yeltsin said.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Confident of KANU's Success in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi said today that he is confident that the ruling KANU (Kenya
African National Union) will win in the forthcoming General
Elections.
</P>
<P>
Moi was speaking at a special annual delegates' conference of
the ruling party KANU, when he launched the 1997 Manifesto.
</P>
<P>
The manifesto is entitled "Our Vision for the Next Millennium:
Consolidating Peace, Stability and Development for Prosperity of
All Kenyans".
</P>
<P>
Moi noted that the foundation of the manifesto is " first a
commitment to good and open government and second the pledges of
action in 12 key areas to bring about development and improve the
lives of our people."
</P>
<P>
The pledges of action include confronting poverty and creating
jobs by maintaining a sustainable economic growth, strengthening
the manufacturing base by creating a dynamic environment for
industry growth, and preparing the education system for the next
century.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that in the entire African continent there
is no other party which has been in power longer than KANU.
</P>
<P>
He attributed KANU's long-term in power to its "pragmatic
social, political and economic policies" carried out in the past
dozens of years.
</P>
<P>
Moi said that the recent events of solving constitutional
reforms through dialogue, consultation and consensus, have
demonstrated a new maturity in Kenya's politics.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Moi criticized the donor community for its
attitude toward Kenya.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in the past five years Kenya had carried out
"far-reaching reforms which have liberalized our economy".
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "we continue to be faced with criticisms and
pressure by our donor friends".
</P>
<P>
Taking the legislation on energy and posts and
tele-communications as an example, the president said that even
after it has gone through major parliamentary stages, donors
appeared to still doubt the government's sincerity and were
withholding assistance.
</P>
<P>
The KANU delegates conference today made major amendments of
the party constitution where the title of the president of the
party is replaced by the national chairman and vice-president
replaced with first vice-chairman.

<HEADLINE> UN Concerns over Food Shortage in S.Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Serious food shortage in Sierra
Leone has aroused concern from the United Nations food relief
agency as tens of thousands of vulnerable people are at risk in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.agency said today that food stocks they have in Sierra
Leone are running low as unrest continued since the military coup
in May this year, according to the British Broadcasting
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Years of civil war has already disrupted agriculture, making
many Sierra Leoneans dependent on food aid long before the coup.
</P>
<P>
However, sporadic fightings have prevented farmers from
planting. Food prices have doubled, and with banks and stores
closed since the coup, few people can afford to buy.
</P>
<P>
Food stocks have been sent to neighboring countries but
security clearance has not been given to take them into Sierra
Leone from the west African peacekeeping force enforcing a
sub-regional and UN embargo.
</P>
<P>
A regional director of the World Food Program, who
acknowledged that the agency has no more food left in Sierra
Leone, has called for food stuff to be taken into the country in
the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, the nutrition of the people will deteriorate
dramatically, the official added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unemployment Rate in October Drops to New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. unemployment rate
went down in October to a 24-year low of 4.7 percent, the Labor
Department reported here today.
</P>
<P>
Last month's seasonally adjusted rate of joblessness was the
lowest since October 1973 when it declined to 4.6 percent,
according to the report. Employers added 284,000 jobs to their
payrolls and average hourly wages for non-supervisory workers
jumped a strong 6 cents to a seasonally adjusted 12.41 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Many of the new hires were women. October's 4 percent
unemployment rate for adult women was the lowest since January
1970.
</P>
<P>
"The American economy has now added 13 million new jobs since
1993 while inflation has remained low and stable. All this
provides further evidence that our economy is the strongest in a
generation," President Bill Clinton said at the White House.
</P>
<P>
However, the report raised new concerns about labor shortages.
Before Southeast Asia's financial turmoil affected the Wall Street
stock market, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan had
been warning tight labor markets could soon translate into an
inflation-fueling acceleration in wage gains.
</P>
<P>
Job growth in October was the third straight significantly
higher than the 239,000 monthly average since the end of last
year.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing jobs increased by 54,000, the largest gain in
about 7 years. Half the gain occurred in just two industries:
industrial machinery and transportation equipment. Construction
added 20,000 jobs, the most since May.
</P>
<P>
Service businesses added more than 200,000 jobs, including an
unusually large 18,000 gain in finance industries. Computer
services added 15,000 jobs and engineering and management services
gained 19,000.
</P>
<P>
Among whites, the rate fell from 4.3 percent to 4.1 percent,
and among blacks from 9.6 percent to 9.5 percent. Hispanic
unemployment increased to 8 percent from 7.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Three charged in US Bond Fraud Ring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Three men were charged with a
multi-million dollar plot to defraud finance houses with fake U.S.
bonds, said local reports today.
</P>
<P>
London police, with the help of U.S. Secret Service agents, had
uncovered a "staggering" scam involving 800 million U.S. dollar
worth of bogus U.S. Treasury bonds printed from a desktop
computer.
</P>
<P>
An American, a Taiwanese and a Leicesershire man were arrested
outside a bank in the City Thursday after a 10-day operation by
British police and an American agent. They were accused of
circulating fake bonds on the finance markets and would appear in
court Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Police struck after the team allegedly deposited the fake
Treasury bonds, or U.S. government debt, into a London bank.
</P>
<P>
The bonds purported to date from the 1940s but were probably
run up on a 1990s computer and are currently being examined by
U.S. agents. Genuine Treasury bonds are traded in financial
markets around the world, offering investors a safe investment
with a fixed rate of return.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing genuine about them. It's a fraudulent
document completely, probably made by a sophisticated desktop
publishing program," said Jim Gallagher, Secret Service attache
at the U.S. embassy.
</P>
<P>
British police, too, said the amount of money at stake was
"quite staggering" and paid tribute to the success of the joint
U.S.-British operation.

<HEADLINE> Kim Warns Against Election "Wrongdoings" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 8 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Young-sam today strongly warned against behavioral breaches,
including defamation and slander, in the 18th presidential
election scheduled for December.
</P>
<P>
In a national broadcast delivered on television and radio, Kim
said: "Anyone found committing wrongdoings in connection with the
elections will be sternly punished in accordance with the law,
regardless of their political party and status."
</P>
<P>
The president expressed hope that the coming election will
serve as an occasion for the people to judge candidates on their
policies, and visions of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"I strongly urge the political parties to immediately stop
engaging in regressive and illegal slander," he added.
</P>
<P>
Still 40 days away the poll, the three major presidential
candidates, opposition leader Kim Dae-jung, the ruling party's Lee
Hoi-chang and a newly-launched party's Rhee In-je, have begun in
earnest their preparations for the race.
</P>
<P>
As parts of their efforts to seek votes, the three parties are
intensifying their attacks on rivals. Even President Kim was
criticized for supporting a specific candidate.
</P>
<P>
Kim expressed concern that overheated competition and
corruption in the course of the campaign could possiblely trigger
a dangerous national crisis.
</P>
<P>
Kim pointed out that outright slander, false propaganda steeped
in malicious intent and unfounded rumors had been portrayed by
media as fact.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive warned: "The presidential election in
December cannot be held in a fair manner and the consequences of
the election will prove to be serious if such chaos and illegal
activities are left intact."
</P>
<P>
Kim cautioned that this kind of election mood would eventually
produce a president who would be unable to carry out the duties of
his office.
</P>
<P>
The president, who left the ruling party yesterday, reiterated
his willingness to impartially manage the election campaign by
saying: "I will try to devise strong measures to head off a
possible national crisis by putting the campaign atmosphere on the
right track."

<HEADLINE> Capital Move Important, Says Kazakhstan President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan President Nursultan
Nazarbayev said today the continuing move of the capital to
Akmola, which is some 1,000 kilometers away from Alma Ata, is an
important event in his country.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remark at a ceremony held here for
transferring of Kazakhstan's national flag, emblem and
presidential flag to the new capital city.
</P>
<P>
The move of the center of Kazakhstan's administration and
political power would greatly advance the political and economic
development, and balance between the regions in Kazakhstan,
Nazarbayev said.
</P>
<P>
He declared that from now, the president and his operating
institutions would work in the two capital cities, and a Boeing
airliner will fly for them between the two places once a day.
</P>
<P>
Under the president's decree, Akmola will become the formal
capital on December 10. But the overall move was expected to
finish in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Kazakh president made the decision to move the capital in
September 1995. Some government departments started moving to the
new capital at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Enthusiastic support from the masses and state organizations
was the most reliable guarantee for the smooth move, Nazarbayev
said.
</P>
<P>
Among those present at today's ceremony were parliamentarians,
government officials and representatives of religious circles and
young students.

<HEADLINE> 3 Persons Killed by Floods in Somalia's Leprosy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Three persons have been
drowned after Somalia's main leprosy quarantine camp at Jilib
district of southern Somalia was destroyed by floods that hit the
area yesterday caused by heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
According to Durran Abdulle Wardhere, a former World Concern
employee, in Jilib town told reporters on the VHF radio today
that eight more people still remain unaccounted for as the whole
village, Faragurow, accommodating 2500 leprosy patients is now
under the water.
</P>
<P>
Most of the leprosy patients are now in Jilib town with no
shelter, food or medicine. The arrival of the flood displaced
leprosy patients, which is not only imposing economical havoc to
the town, but a worry to the inhabitants of Jilib because they
will spread their super infectious and contagious disease.
</P>
<P>
The leprosy patients are now scattered everywhere in the town
communicating with the people, thus spreading the disease.
</P>
<P>
The village of Faragurow has first been set up as a quarantine
camp for the leprosy patients 35 years ago during the first
civilian regime in Somalia. During the civil war, the Somali
militiamen did not go to that camp, which with the time became a
large village.
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, the Somalis believed that the leprosy patients
are cannibals and eat the human flesh which would cure them.
Faragurow is one of few villages that survived the civil war, but
it is now washed away by the floods.
</P>
<P>
The local authorities in Jilib town appeal for the
international aid agencies to provide them dry food, medicine and
plastic canvases for the flood displaced people.

<P>
Japan ended two-leg group qualifying with 13 points from three
wins, four draws and one defeat, and that means the United Arab
Emirates, who are to play South Korea Sunday at home, can do
nothing to overtake the Japanese.
</P>
<P>
South Korea already earned a berth in the 1998 finals in France
by securing top spot, while Japan will take on the Group A
runners-up Iran, who lost to Qatar 2-0 Friday, in a playoff for
the third ticket from Asia.
</P>
<P>
Yutaka Akita opened the account for Japan in the 11th minute
and Hidetoshi Nakata put his side 2-0 four minutes later. Masashi
Nakayama added one more in the 44th minute to close the first half.
</P>
<P>
Skipper Masami Ihara and substitute Takuya Takagi were also on
target in the second half, scoring in the 66th and 88th minutes,
while Pavel Yevteyev pulled one goal back in the 72nd-minute from
a free kick.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Russia Crack Down on Boundary Crimes (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and Russian police have
joined their efforts in making a dent in border crimes.
</P>
<P>
One example of the crackdown occurred in Dongning, a city near
the boundary river of Suifen in the southeastern part of
Heilongjiang Province, the Chinese neighbor of Ussuriysk, a city
in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Chinese police this spring successfully tracked down a criminal
group who attempted to go to Russia in a Russian container.
</P>
<P>
Guards from Dongning's Frontier Inspection Station discovered a
fake frontier inspection seal when they were processing
application forms sent by a Russian administrative clerk of a
non-governmental trade market.
</P>
<P>
The clerk also was trying to get illegal residence permits for
Chinese citizens in Russia.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese police reported the case to their Russian
counterparts. With cooperation from the other side of the river,
the criminal group quickly was tracked down.
</P>
<P>
The Dongning case is only one example of the cooperation
between Chinese and Russian police in cracking down on crimes in
open ports along the Sino-Russia boundary.
</P>
<P>
"The number of blockade runners, smugglers, and drug dealers
has sharply dropped, thanks to concerted action by police of the
two countries," said a Chinese frontier inspection official.
</P>
<P>
The line between China and Russia is the world's longest
boundary between two nations. More than 4,300 kilometers long, the
boundary starts in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province and
ends in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
As Sino-Russian friendship has developed over the years, dozens
of cities and counties along the boundary became trading
ports. Rapid growth of boundary trade and tourism has sometimes
been exploited to the advantage of smugglers and criminals.
</P>
<P>
Boundary crimes have caught the attention of leaders of both
countries and relevant departments. Prime ministers of China and
Russia signed an agreement on a Sino-Russian boundary
administrative system. The Chinese Ministry of Public Security
also signed an agreement with Russia on frontier inspection
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The agreements have enabled frontier guards across the border
to take strong measures hand-in-hand against boundary crimes.

<HEADLINE> River Blocking Gives Proof to Glory of Socialism: Commentary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING (Three Gorges), November 8 (Xinhua) -- The blocking
of the Yangtze River today has shown the world the glory of
socialist modernization and the resolve of the Chinese people to
conquer the nature, said a Xinhua commentators' article.
</P>
<P>
The article cited this successful completion of the first-phase
giant Three Gorges Project as "a proof that the Communist Party of
China (CPC) is a political party which serves the people and works
in their interests."
</P>
<P>
For generations, the people have been exposed to the menace of
floods in the middle and lower reaches of the mighty river, it
noted. After the founding of new China in 1949, the long-aspired
aspiration to build a comprehensive water conservation and
hydropower project at the Three Gorges site to tame the river, is
being turned into reality under the leadership of the CPC.
</P>
<P>
The National People's Congress (NPC) adopted a resolution in
the spring of 1992 on building the Three Gorges Project, and this
was based on the people's wisdom and determination, as well as
relative strong national strength.
</P>
<P>
The article goes on to say that "the smooth progress of its
construction shows that great deeds can be performed by pooling of
resources from all aspects under the socialist system."
</P>
<P>
The entire nation supports the move by imposing additional
charges on electricity, a proportion of which goes to a state fund
for construction of the project; provinces, municipalities and
central government departments render a helping hand to the work
of resettlement, which involves a combined population of 1.2
million; and scientific, technological and engineering circles
work in close co-ordination for tackling hundreds of knotty
technical problems that have cropped up during construction.
</P>
<P>
The closure of the Yangtz ahead of schedule demonstrates the
immense vitality injected into all undertakings by reform and
opening up, and "the integration of the socialist system with
market-oriented economy, of a socialist market economy with
advanced science and technology formed the material basis for
building the top-rate project in the world."
</P>
<P>
With the damming of the Yellow river at Xiaolangdi on October
28 and that of the Yangtze here today, the article said, the
Chinese people "are creating miracles" and scaling heights with
their heroic deeds in the history of the human race's ambition to
tame rivers.
</P>
<P>
It declared that the success of the first phases of the two
projects will "greatly encourage the Chinese people under the
banner of the 15th CPC National Congress and boost their
confidence in advancing the cause of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics into the next century."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people will surely erect a historic monument to
benefit generations with the completion of the Three Gorges
project under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee, and
with joint efforts of builders and all those caring and rendering
supporting the project, the article said.

"We'll raise a flag or call our Russian colleagues for help
once we find criminals crossing the border," said Shi Yejian,
chief of the Frontier Inspection Bureau of Heilongjiang
Province. "And they will inform us in the same way in the same
case."
</P>
<P>
Chinese and Russian frontier inspection bodies have hunted down
and seized suspected blockade runners, drug smugglers and weapons
dealers due to their close cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Without effective cooperation between Chinese and Russian
police, Heilongjiang's trade with Russia could never be so vital,"
said Wang Zongzhang, vice-governor of Heilongjiang.
</P>
<P>
Heilongjiang has a border of more than 3,000 kilometers with
Russia and 25 ports open to Russia. The province plays an
important role in China's trade with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that border trade between Heilongjiang
and Russia was worth 250 million U.S. dollars in the first nine
months of this year, setting a record for border trade between the
two entities.
</P>
<P>
Heilongjiang, taking advantage of its geographic edge, had 8
billion U.S. dollars worth of imports and exports from 1987 to
1996, accounting for two-thirds of the total Sino-Russian trade.
</P>
<P>
The administrative head of Amur Region of Russia said
cooperation in safeguarding the border has become a reliable
guarantee for both sides to forge friendly relations in trade, to
develop a peaceful and harmonious atmosphere and to promote
prosperity in the border area.

TEHRAN, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Defense Minister Ali
Shamkhani announced here today that Iran is ready to launch joint
marine maneuvers with Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
According to the official news agency IRNA, Shamkhani made the

</P>
<P>
The Iranian minister said that launching the joint marine

<HEADLINE> Houston May Replace Los Angeles As Smog Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 7 (Xinhua) -- While Los Angeles enjoys
clearer skies, the smog problem in Houston, in the southern state
of Texas, has become worse.
</P>
<P>
Environmental officials warned if recent trends continue,
Houston could inherit the California city's never-relinquished
title as the nation's smog capital within a few years, Houston
newspapers say.
</P>
<P>
Historically Los Angeles has the largest number of days when
the ozone readings -- smog is also known as ozonic pollution --
are measured above the health standard, and Houston usually comes
second. In 1989, Los Angeles had 160 days with readings above the
ozone standard, while Houston had 66 such days.
</P>
<P>
This year, in the first 10 months, the period when most high
ozone readings occur, above standard ozone rates were measured on
50 days in the Houston area, and on 68 days around Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
However, Houston also recorded the nation's highest individual
ozone measurement for the first time, exceeding Los Angeles' peak
reading.
</P>
<P>
On March 23, ozone in southeast Houston was measured at 234
parts per billion (ppb) -- almost double the 125 ppb level when a
violation of the federal standard is recorded.
</P>
<P>
Readings over 200 ppb also occurred on two days in September.
Los Angeles officials say their area has recorded ozone above 200
ppb on only one day this year.
</P>
<P>
At 115 ppb, a Health Advisory is declared and healthy adults
and children are advised to avoid prolonged, vigorous outdoor
exercise.
</P>
<P>
As weather conditions play a crucial role in the formation of
ground-level ozone in atmospheric reactions with chemical
pollutants, to compare Los Angeles with Houston is difficult. The
weather pattern El Nino is contributing to a record clean smog
season in the Los Angeles area this year.
</P>
<P>
But several officials in Texas reportedly admitted that Houston
was not seeing as great an improvement as Los Angeles in recent
years, and might surpass it in the ozone category.
</P>
<P>
Smog has become a familiar word and everyday presence in Los
Angeles since the early 1940s when local residents began to
realize the consequences of an increasingly industrialized area.
</P>
<P>
In 1943, it was reported that a pall of smoke and fumes
descended on downtown Los Angeles, a city prized for its sunny
climate, cutting visibility to three blocks.
</P>
<P>
But more than half a century of air pollution control has
improved Los Angeles' ozone air quality. For instance, the
controls have reduced the number of days when ozone reached 200
ppb from 121 in 1977 to seven in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The number of days exceeding the state health standard, which
is more stringent than the federal level, was cut to 151 in 1996
from 280 in 1977.

Co-sponsored by NASA and Japan's National Space Development
Agency (NASDA), the TMI project will provide a three-year record
of global tropical and subtropical rainfall, a major predictor of
climate and weather forecasting.
</P>
<P>
The TMI will operate with a precipitation radar for accurate
measurement of rainfall over large areas, and will improve
scientists' understanding of air and sea interactions which lead
to such seasonal events as the "El Nino" effect.
</P>
<P>
The instrument is the second in Hughes's line of microwave
imagers. The first, the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager, or SSM/I,
was designed for the United States Air Force's Defense
Meteorological Satellite Program, launched in June 1987.
</P>
<P>
It sees either traditionally visible weather images or those
unable to be viewed by infrared sensors. While the SSM/I can see
only the tops of cloud formations, the TMI, because of its ability
of detecting microwave energy emitted from a source, can peer into
and through clouds. As a result, it can more accurately measure
rain, wind speeds over the ocean, the amount of water in clouds
and soil moisture.

Hughes Space and Communications Co., a unit of Hughes
Electronics Corp, is the world's leading manufacturer of
commercial communications satellites. It is also a major supplier
of spacecraft and equipment to the U.S. government, and builds
weather satellites for the U.S. and Japan.

<HEADLINE> HK Launches Campaign to Promote Information Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Hongkong Telecom, a major
telecom provider in the city, has launched a "Hong Kong --
Connecting to the Information Age" campaign to promote public
awareness of the information age.
</P>
<P>
The first public forum for the campaign was held today with
over 200 participants from the community sharing their views on
the challenges of education in the information age.
</P>
<P>
In his opening remarks, Hongkong Telecom Chief Executive Linus
Cheung stressed that in the age of information the standard of
education is closely related to the application of information
technology. "Only a good education environment will ensure the
development of our future leaders, and the continued success of
Hong Kong," he said.
</P>
<P>
Special advisor to the campaign Professor Charles Kao noted
that the challenges brought by the information age could be
highlighted by the impact of information development on the
approach to education and a changing demand in the working force.
</P>
<P>
"The new approach to educating our next generation would call
for new tools for acquiring knowledge, such as computer-added
learning and interactive multimedia. It also implies the urgent
need for training in information technology," he said.
</P>
<P>
Other participants, including government officials, educators
and parents, also voiced their views on such topics as the pace of
development in information technology, allocation of resources,
and the need for technical staff in schools.
</P>
<P>
A series of seminars and workshops will follow as part of the
80-day public education campaign in support of the government's
initiatives in information technology highlighted in the policy
address of Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa.

<HEADLINE> Macao Attracts Huge Investment in 3 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Macao attracted a total of 530
million patacas (about 67 million U.S. dollars) of external
investment during the past three years, an investment official
said.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Daily today quoted Joao Domingos, president of the
Macao Trade and Investment Promotion Bureau, as saying that the
law on immigration through investment, which was promulgated in
April 1995, has proved to be effective in attracting overseas
investment.
</P>
<P>
By the end of October this year, 698 of the 793 investment
applications had been approved, involving a total investment of
more than 530 million patacas (about 67 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The investments covered such fields as property, manufacturing,
hotel and catering services, and other service sectors.
</P>
<P>
Domingos said that most of the capital came from Hong Kong,
Taiwan, and overseas Chinese around the world.
</P>
<P>
He said the government pays close attention to applications by
technical professionals and those for large projects. There were
413 applications from technical professionals and 382 for large
projects over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Macao dropped the benchmark for immigration through investment
twice in the past three years, from 2 million patacas (about
253,000 dollars) to 1 million patacas (about 126,500 dollars) the
first time, and further to 500,000 patacas (about 63,211 dollars)
this year.
</P>
<P>
Domingos said that it is the wish of the government to turn
Macao into not only a logistics base for Hong Kong, but also a
superior service center in the Pearl River Delta.

<HEADLINE> Round up: Christie's Hong Kong Autumn Auctions Achieves Record Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Christie's Hong Kong had a
record-breaking week during its autumn auction series, realizing
an impressive total of 329.7 million HK dollars (42.26 million
U.S. dollars), the highest seasonal sale total ever achieved by
Christie's in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The auctions on November 3-6 also established several world
records, including the world record price for jadeite jewelry when
an exceptional jadeite bead necklace sold for a staggering 72.62
million HK dollars (9.31 million U.S. dollars), according a press
release from Christie's.
</P>
<P>
The superb single-strand jadeite necklace of 27 ungraduated
beads, cut from a stone auspiciously named "Doubly Fortunate",
broke three world records on the last day of the auctions on
Thursday and was bought by a private collector bidding on the
telephone, its price more than doubling the presale estimate.
</P>
<P>
The necklace set a world record price for jadeite jewelry at
auction, surpassing the record set by the Mdivani Necklace sold at
Christie's Hong Kong for 33.02 million HK dollars (4.23 million
U.S. dollars) in October 1994. It also became the most expensive
item ever sold at auction in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The next highest price in the Exceptional Jadeite Jewelry sale
was achieved by a superb jadeite cabochon and diamond ring from
the "66,000" stone, selling for 7.5 million HK dollars (961,538
U.S. dollars), nearly double the presale estimate and was a record
for a jadeite cabochon at auction.
</P>
<P>
The totals for Jadeite Jewelry sales came to 162.5 million HK
dollars (20.83 million U.S. dollars), the highest total ever for
any jadeite jewelry sales.
</P>
<P>
The sale of Magnificent Jewelry on November 4 attracted strong
bidding and culminated in an exciting tussle for the largest
circular-cut D-flawless diamond ever to be offered at auction in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
The exceptional unmounted diamond of 22.13 carats fetched 14.32
million HK dollars (1.83 million U.S. dollars), or over 645,000 HK
dollars (82,592 U.S. dollars) per carat, well above the presale
estimate of 10 million HK dollars (1.28 million U.S. dollars),
making it the most expensive piece of Western jewelry ever sold at
auction in Asia.
</P>
<P>
In the sale of Masterworks of Chinese Art, an early Ming
Dynasty underglaze-copper-red decorated pear-shaped vase of the
Hongwu period (1368-1398), believed to be the last important and
perfect example of its kind available on the art market, sold to
an anonymous telephone bidder for 22.02 million HK dollars (2.82
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The vase established a world record price for any underglaze
decorated Chinese porcelain and became the most expensive Chinese
porcelain sold in Asia.
</P>
<P>
It also get a record price for Chinese art at Christie's. A
magnificent famille rose nine-peach globular bottle vase from the
Qianlong period (1736-1795) achieved a record price of 8.49
million HK dollars (1.08 million U.S. dollars), more than doubling
the presale estimate after intense bidding.
</P>
<P>
Four artists' records were set on the first day of the
auctions. "Poppy", a masterpiece by contemporary artist Chen
Yifei, sold for 3.87 million HK dollars (496,153 U.S. dollars),
establishing a record price for a Chinese oil painting at an
international auction, as well as a record price for the artist at
auction.
</P>
<P>
The painting shows a young woman in traditional Chinese dress
holding a fan, and was sold to an Asian private buyer in the
saleroom.
</P>
<P>
Wu Guanzhong, with his "Lotus", set a record price for an oil
painting by the artist at auction with a price of 1.505 million HK
dollars (192.294 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In the Fine Classical Chinese Paintings and Calligraphy sale,
Lu Guang's "Water Village" fetched 2.44 million HK dollars
(312,820 U.S. dollars), while Jin Xuan's "The Joy of Fishing" was
sold for 2.33 million HK dollars (298,717 U.S. dollars), both
record prices for the artists at auction.
</P>
<P>
Anthony Lin, deputy chairman of Christie's Asia, said: "We are
thrilled with the record results of the autumn auctions which
reflected the strongest trend seen in recent years for objects of
the highest quality."
</P>
<P>
The recent instability of the financial market did not deter
buyers from bidding to some of the highest levels ever seen at
auctions here in Asia, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are extremely encouraged by the record sale totals of 646
million HK dollars (82.82 million U.S. dollars) for 1997 and by
the fact that the record total for our spring sales was
surpassed," Lin added.

Wim Duisenburg, the current president of the European Monetary
Institute.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker of Luxembourg, which is
serving the six-month rotating presidency of the 15-nation
European Union, said earlier this week that it was wrong to
present two candidates in terms of a conflict between two sets of
monetary policies, according to today's issue of the journal
"European Report."
</P>
<P>
During a Wednesday meeting of the Council of Finance Ministers
in Brussels, German financial chief Theo Waigel spoke of
Duisenburg's qualities and regretted that the issue had to be
argued in full view of the public.
</P>
<P>
Waigel said that no Franco-German agreement had been reached
concerning the plan of the nomination though he admitted that the
French authorities did tell him two weeks ago of their decision to
submit a candidate.
</P>
<P>
Dutch Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm said at the same council
meeting that his country thought that the only serious candidate
was Duisenburg. He regretted the fact that France "suddenly"
pushed forward its own candidate.
</P>
<P>
Luxembourg Economy Minister Robert Goebels said that the press
in his country was rooting for the Duisenburg candidacy while
Belgian Finance Minister Philippe Maystadt said that when
Duisenburg was appointed head of the European Monetary Institute
in December last year at the EU Dublin summit, it was obvious that
the decision was taken with a view to the Dutchman becoming ECB
president.
</P>
<P>
But the Dublin summit simply concluded that the union had
decided to appoint the Dutchman "as president of the European
Monetary Institute as of July 1, 1997 until the establishment of
the ECB."
</P>
<P>
Other EU member states gave guarded reactions to France's
nomination of Jean-Claude Trichet, the Governor of the French
Central Bank, to become the president of the executive board of
the future ECB.
</P>
<P>
Four to six members of the ECB executive board will be chosen
by countries taking part in the first wave of the single currency
when it is launched on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The names of countries to join the euro will be announced on
May 2 next year when successful candidate countries will also be
entitled to become executive board members.
</P>
<P>
Since there will be fewer board members than there are single
currency participants, it is sure to lead up to talks among single
currency countries hoping to ensure a place on the board.

<P>
PARIS, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Being the only big union to approve a protocol of agreement
with the employers of road transport industry, the CFDT succeeded
on Friday in having most of the barriers on the highways
lifted. The CGT and FO, two other major unions which refused to
sign the protocol, appeared the big loser in the six-day labor
conflict of France's trucking industry.
</P>
<P>
-- The Franco-British summit in London held on Friday allowed
France and Britain to affirm their agreement in the field of the
future European Central Bank, with Paris agreeing to let London
have a seat at the board of directors of the bank despite a German
suggestion to "freeze" such a seat. British Prime Minister Tony
Blair, French President Jacques Chirac and French Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin also appeared as "friendly trio" despite differences
between Blair and Jospin over economic policies.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- On the fifth day of the labor conflict of France's trucking
industry, the CFDT trade union, which was the biggest union of
striking truckers, decided to sign the protocol of agreement
elaborated during Thursday night, thus giving the signal for the
lifting of barriers on the highways. Only 16 barriers remained on
the roads by 22:30 local time on Friday, as other unions refused
to sign the protocol.
</P>
<P>
-- The stagnation of the Japanese economy and the crisis in
Southeast Asia once again caused a dark day in world stock
exchange markets on Friday, with the Tokyo stock exchange falling
by 4.2 percent, Paris by 2.95 percent and New York by 1.42
percent.

<HEADLINE> 350,000 Lebanese Workers to Take Part in Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 8 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese labor union
organization has confirmed that about 350,000 worders are expected
to take part in a one-day warning strike next Thursday if the
government does not meet their demands of raising wage.
</P>
<P>
The government-recognized General Labor Confederation (GLC)
confirmed Friday that about 350,000 workers, or 15 percent of the
country's workforce, will presumably take part in the one-day
strike, today's local newspaper Daily Star reported.
</P>
<P>
The group demanded the government to triple the minimum monthly
wage to around 530 U.S. dollars, a substantial increase over
earlier reported demands, to double pensions for the private
sector and independent utilities and to implement cost-of-living
increase to match inflation.
</P>
<P>
Ghanime Zoghbi, president of GLC, told the newspaper that
"since our demands have not yet been answered, we will proceed with
our strike."
</P>
<P>
"Nothing will change our position unless workers are given
what is rightfully theirs," he added.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak, Arafat Hold Talks in Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
back home from his week-long foreign trip, held a meeting with
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat at
his residence Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
The talks covered the latest developments of the Mideast peace
process and followed up the just-concluded peace negotiations held
in Washington between Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy and
Palestine Liberation Organization deputy head Mamoud Abbas (Abu
Mazen).
</P>
<P>
An enlarged session, grouping Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal
al-Ganzouri, Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, Palestinian National
Council member Marawan Kanafany and Arafat's advisor Nabil Abu
Rdei, is being held.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived here Friday from Congo, where he addressed the
first Francophone summit of African, Carribean and Pacific
countries on the hurdles to the peace process due to Israeli
measures.
</P>
<P>
No tangible achievements were made in the Washington talks, but
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is expected to hold
separate talks with Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu soon. The time and venues have not been finalized.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish settlement issue, together with Israeli delay in
further troop redeployments in the West Bank, are the leading
obstacles blocking progress in the Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with
Israel, has been a key mediator in efforts to revive the
Israeli-Palestinian talks, frozen after Netanyahu embarked on
building a new Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has said any progress in the peace process, be it a
halt to settlement building or redepoyment, would help break the
ice. He made the statement on November 1 in the United Arab
Emirates, the first leg of his four-nation tour that also took him
to Malaysia, Oman and Bahrain.

<HEADLINE> Infrastructure Bottlenecks Affect Production in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 8 (Xinhua)-- The infrastructure bottlenecks
in power, transport and communications have resulted in an average
loss of production of 20 percent in industrial units of north
India, said a survey released here today by the Phd Chamber of
Commerce and Industry (PHDCCI).
</P>
<P>
The survey, which was carried out recently in northern India,
has shown an average shortfall of 30 percent in power supply
compared with the total electricity requirement of the industries
in the areas. There were frequent trippings and voltage
fluctuations and it has become difficult for exporters to meet
deadlines.
</P>
<P>
The problem was aggravated when raw materials, sub-assembles
and packing materials are not forthcoming as suppliers of these
items also did not have adequate power supply, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
The chamber urged the government to provide more funds for road
development and encourage private contractors to construct,
maintain and repair roads, which "were at present in poor
condition."
</P>
<P>
The existing telephone service was "unsatisfactory and
unreliable" and complaints about cable and exchange faults were
common, the survey further said.

<HEADLINE> Meeting on Asian Social Development Ends in Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials from 25
economies in Asia and the Pacific region concluded here today the
meeting on social development in preparation for a ministerial
conference on November 10-11.
</P>
<P>
During the four-day meeting, the senior officials reviewed the
social development situation in the region and the prospects into
the next century.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that poverty alleviation, employment expansion and
the integration of vulnerable groups into the society remained the
most daunting social problems facing the region in spite of
efforts by the economies in the region.
</P>
<P>
Poverty remained the prime obstacle to the social development
in the region, they noted, adding despite advances in economy, the
region is still home to 1.3 billion poor people, about
three-fourths of the world's total poor population.
</P>
<P>
Poverty reduction, employment expansion and social integration
are three core issues of social development defined by the World
Summit for Social Development in Copenhagen, Denmark in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The delegates assessed the progress made by the economies
towards achieving the goals and targets they set in the Agenda for
Action on Social Development approved in Manila in 1994 in
preparation for the Copenhagen summit.
</P>
<P>
To accelerate the implementation of the Agenda for Action on
Social Development, they recommended formulating more policies and
programs, raising budgetary expenditure, stimulating the
participation of all sectors of society, enhancing education,
primary health care and human resources development and
strengthening international cooperation for the social development
in the region amid other recommendations.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, organized by UN Economic and Social Commission for
Asia and the Pacific, was convened on November 5 -8 and also
attended by representatives of some international organizations.

<HEADLINE> Century-Old Dream to Materialize with River-Damming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING (Three Gorges), November 8 (Xinhua) -- Today's
damming of the Yangtze for Three Gorges Project, the world's
largest water control scheme, is turning the Chinese people's
long-cherished dream of developing local resources into reality.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin made this solemn announcement at the
Three Gorges Project site in central China's Hubei Province today.
</P>
<P>
At 8:52 AM, Premier Li Peng ordered to launch the damming
process. Three green signal flares were shot into the sky and more
than 100 dump trucks charged toward the four dike-heads of the two
cofferdams, unloading tons upon tons of rocks and gravel into the
swift current.
</P>
<P>
Six and a quarter hours later, the gap in the cofferdam on the
upstream finally joined up, giving way to the encroachment of the
cofferdam, forcing water flows into the man-made diversion canal
off the southern bank.
</P>
<P>
With three green signal flares darting into the sky at 3:30 PM,
Premier Li officially declared: "The Yangtze is successfully
dammed for the Three Gorges Project."
</P>
<P>
The viewers then shouted and burst into cheers at the worksite
in the Xiling Gorge, mingled with sounds of crackling
firecrackers, beating drums and blowing trumpets, and sirening of
motor vehicles and vessels sailing in the adjacent diversion
channel.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng inspected the damming
process along with more than 4,000 dignitaries and guests from
across China and overseas. And tens of millions of people
worldwide watched the river closure scene live televised via
satellite.
</P>
<P>
Then, President Jiang rose to speak amid applause. In tribute
to the river-damming, he hailed it as a major event in China's
modernization drive and also a feat of the mankind to conquer and
reshape the nature, and called for redoubled efforts from the
project builders to ensure the operation of the first generating
units in 2003.
</P>
<P>
The river-blocking signals the end of the first phase of the
Three Gorges Project, and the beginning of the second phase, and
in the ensuing six years, the project builders will erect the
world's largest dam and No. 1 hydro-power station in the lot
between the two cofferdams.
</P>
<P>
Though this stretch of the mighty Yangtze was cut off in only
six and a half hours today, it has taken almost a whole century
for the the Chinese people to translate "Three Gorges dream" into
practice.
</P>
<P>
Yangtze floods left the people with untold miseries and
sufferings, which prompted Dr. Sun Yat-Sen, the forerunner of
China's democratic revolution, to dream for a dam project early
this century.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the founding of the new China in 1949, the project
had always been on the mind of the top Chinese leaders from late
Chairman Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping, to Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
Labeled as another gigantic, ambitious project the country has
ever undertaken after the Great Wall built more than 2,000 years
ago, the project is expected to cost more than 200 billion yuan
(about 24 billion US dollars) and take another 12 years to
complete.
</P>
<P>
Yet, experts said it is worthwhile, since the project will
greatly reduce the frequency of flooding, and ease energy
bottleneck along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze,
apart from improving navigations on its upper reaches.

ANKARA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has decided to send 700
sailors to bring three frigates back from the United States
following a long debate over the controversial issue, according
to local newspaper "Daily News" today.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the 700 sailors will go to the U.S. in
three groups on November 8, 17 and 25.
</P>
<P>
After the Turkish sailors being trained by U.S. navy experts in
U.S. Norfolk military harbor, Virginia, the first frigate will
leave for Turkey in February 1998 while the other two frigates
will arrive in Turkey in April next year.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Turkish navy sent hundreds of sailors to
Norfolk to bring back the ships bought from the U.S. at a cost of
about 40 million U.S. dollars, but the U.S. Administration delayed
handing the draft for the approval of arms sales to the
U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Turkish sailors were recalled back and it led
to a diplomatic row between the two NATO allies.

Chongwe is reported to have asked the immigration authorities
at Harare Airport for permission to remain in the country when he
arrived from London on the planned way home last weekend.
</P>
<P>
Chongwe sought the assistance of immigration security
officials to stay in Zimbabwe, citing fears for his safety if he
proceeded to Lusaka.
</P>

approached immigration officials and asked them to allow him to
remain in country.

<HEADLINE> Week Report on Malaysia's CPO, Tin &AMP; Rubber Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's markets of
crude palm oil (CPO) physicals, tin and rubber ended this week all
lower.
</P>
<P>
The CPO physicals market closed the week weak with November
South ending 55 ringgit (about 16.66 U.S. dollars) lower at 1,645
ringgit (about 498.48 U.S. dollars) per ton from last week's 1,700
ringgit (about 515.15 U.S. dollars) per ton.
</P>
<P>
The market is expected to stage a slight rebound next week
following the recovery of the CPO futures contract and demand for
CPO is expected to improve as there have been expectations that
the market has fully corrected and therefore ready for an upturn,
dealers said.
</P>
<P>
There are also possibilities that the market will undertake a
fresh bull run as players seemed to have begun building up their
positions ahead of a possible acute shortage in CPO production due
to the wet monsoon season now, they said.
</P>
<P>
On the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) this week, tin closed
this week's trading at 17.82 ringgit (about 5.4 U.S. dollars) per
kg, down 59 sen from last week's 18.41 ringgit (about 5.58 U.S.
dollars) per kg.
</P>
<P>
The five-day accumulated turnover this week totaled 415 tons
compared to 412 tons last week.
</P>
<P>
Prices on the KLTM are expected to be volatile next week, a
dealer said.
</P>
<P>
This week, the Malaysian rubber market turned out weaker with
December RSS One decreasing by another six sen to 287.00 sen
(about 86.97 U.S. cents) per kg at the close against last week's
293.00 sen (about 88.79 U.S. cents) per kg and the SMR 20 falling
5.50 sen (about 1.67 U.S. cents) to 286.00 sen (about 86.67 U.S.
cents) per kg.
</P>
<P>
The local rubber market is expected to see uncertainty next
week in tandem with the continued instability of the ringgit
against the U.S. dollar, dealers said.

Lahore, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's strong historical
relations with China are "as unshakable as mountains," Shahid
Hamid, governor of Pakistan's Punjab Province said here today.

chairperson of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress of China, who arrived here this morning from the capital
of Islamabad to participate in Pakistan's Golden Jubilee
celebrations here.
</P>
<P>
"In Pakistan's foreign policy, we very much value our strong
historical relations with China," said Hamid.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who is visiting Pakistan at the invitation of the
Pakistani government, echoed Hamid's remarks, saying that to
further cement the time-tested Sino-Pakistani relationship is the
established policy of the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
"This relationship conforms to the fundamental interests of the
peoples of the two countries," she added.
</P>

She also expressed her hope that Pakistan and China would work
together to forge an all-round cooperative partnership oriented
towards the 21st century on the basis of the existing friendship.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Committed to Harmonize Employment Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is committed to work out
an employment policy which is in harmony with those of other
member countries of the Southern African Developmemt Community
(SADC), labor minister Peter Machungwa said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Maily today quoted him as saying in reference to
the SADC labor and employment sector that the purpose of the
sector is to harmonize employment policies in the region so that
every country benefits.
</P>
<P>
He said the sector, which came into being almost two years
ago, is targeting its efforts at influencing all SADC governments
to adopt policies to ensure that citizens enjoy uniform labor and
employment policies.
</P>
<P>
Some countries have strong economies, a trend which tends to
attract a lot of labor from less developed nations, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to make it possible for such people who come to
Zambia or leave for what they think is greener pasture to be
assured that they will be able to enjoy the same basic facilities
such as social security as they would in any other SADC country,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said SADC countries have expressed great concern over the
high levels of unemployment and low per capita income in the area
and that the creation of the SADC employment and labor sector
will certainly help in alleviating the situation.
</P>
<P>
The formation of the sector is also aimed at addressing
problems such as child labor in SADC countries where the practice
is rife, and plight of employees found with HIV/AIDS.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin's Speech Marking Yangtze-Damming for Three Gorges Project (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING (Three Gorges), November 8 (Xinhua) -- China has
successfully dammed the main course of the Yangtze for the Three
Gorges Project today. President Jiang Zemin made a speech at the
ceremony to mark the success of the river-damming.
</P>
<P>
The full text of the speech is as follows:
</P>
<P>
Comrades and Friends,
</P>
<P>
Today, the world-renowned Three Gorges Water Conservation
Project (TGP) has successfully completed the damming of the main
course of the Yangtze River. This is a major event in China's
efforts to achieve modernization and also a remarkable feat in the
history of the mankind to reshape the nature and exploit natural
resources.
</P>
<P>
This success will greatly inspire our people of all
ethnic groups who are now engaged in reform, opening-up and
modernization drive with full confidence.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council,
I would like to extend our warm congratulations and cordial
greetings to the builders, the scientific and technical personnel
of the project as well as the cadres and masses of people in the
reservoir area, and express our sincere gratitude to people of all
ethnic groups in the country who have supported the project and to
our compatriots in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR), Macao and Taiwan, overseas Chinese and international
friends who have cared for the project.
</P>
<P>
Seventy years ago, Dr. Sun Yat-Sen, the great forerunner of
China's democratic revolution, raised the idea of exploiting the
water and hydro-electric resources of the Three Gorges. After the
founding of New China, Comrade Mao Zedong, Comrade Deng Xiaoping
and other proletarian revolutionaries gave a great deal of their
time and thought to the proposed Three Gorges Project. Several
generations of Chinese scientists have put in an enormous amount
of hard intellectual work. The rapid economic development and
markedly increased overall national strength of our country since
the initiation of its reform and opening-up have provided adequate
conditions for the building of this unprecedented cross-century
project. The age-old dream of the Chinese people to develop and
utilize the resources of the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River has
come closer to becoming true. This proves vividly once again that
socialism is superior in being capable of concentrating resources
to do big jobs.

<TEXT>
<P>
Since the twilight of history, the Chinese nation has been
engaged in the great feat of conquering, developing and exploiting
the nature. The legends of the mythic bird Jingwei determined to
fill the sea with small pebbles and the Foolish Old Man resolved
to remove the mountains standing in his way and the tale of the
Great Yu who harnessed the great floods are just some of the
examples of the ancient Chinese people's indomitable spirit in
successfully conquering the nature. Such ancient water
conservation projects as the Dujiangyan completed over 2,000 years
ago and the Grand Canal built in the Sui Dynasty all played an
important role in the socio-economic development of their
respective time period. The water conservancy and hydro-power
project we are building today on the Three Gorges of the Yangtze
River, the scale and overall benefits of which have no parallel in
the world, will greatly promote the development of our national
economy, and prove to be a lasting exploit in the service of the
present and future generations. It also embodies the great
industrious and dauntless spirit of the Chinese nation and
displays the daring vision of the Chinese people for new horizons
and better future in the course of their reform and opening-up.
</P>
<P>
The successful damming of the river marks the completion of the
first phase of the TGP and the beginning of its second phase. All
participating units in the project must strengthen management in
real earnest, ensure good quality of work and continue to do a
good job in tackling key scientific problems and conducting
experiments so as to ensure power generation by the first group of
generators in 2003.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the construction of the TGP, we should act in
accordance with the law governing socialist market economy while
giving full play to the socialist spirit of unity and
coordination. We should uphold the principle of self-reliance and
taking the initiative in our own hands while actively carrying out
international cooperation and exchanges. We should bring the
initiatives of those foreign-funded enterprises into play and make
use of their advantages in capital and technology while fully
tapping the advantages and potentials of our own enterprises so
that they will make greater contributions to the project and
enhance the level of their development up to a new high.

<P>
A successful resettlement of the people affected by the TGP is
the key to the progress and eventual success of the project. The
work, which involves the interests of one million people, is both
arduous and meticulous. Party committees and governments at all
levels in the TGP-affected areas should summarize the good
experience already achieved and constantly do a good job in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
It is imperative to adhere to the policy of
development-oriented resettlement of the people, seize the
development opportunities brought about by the project, properly
handle the relationship between resettlement and development, make
proper arrangement for the production and livelihood of the
relocatees and guide them towards prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Relevant departments of the Central Government and provinces
and municipalities concerned should continue to do a good job in
implementing their counterpart assistance programs. We are
convinced that with the completion of the TGP, this area will
become a new type of economic zone enjoying economic prosperity
and beautiful environment where people live and work in peace and
contentment.
</P>
<P>
It is of great importance to protect the eco-system in the TGP
area during the course of construction. We should redouble our
efforts to afforest the reservoir area and especially the upper
reaches of the Yangtze River, take comprehensive measures to
constantly improve ecological environment and prevent soil
erosion, for it is an important precondition for ensuring lasting
peace and political stability as well as a sustainable development
of the reservoir area and the entire Yangtze River Valley.
</P>
<P>
As it is a matter that benefits not only the current generation
but our posterity, we should spare no effort year in and year out
and allow no negligence or delay at any time.
</P>
<P>
In short, we should take into consideration the overall
situation and a long-term perspective, formulate plans on a
scientific basis and adopt practical and effective measures to
achieve a coordinated economic, social and ecological development.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River Valley is one of the cradles of the Chinese
civilization and the reservoir area is dotted with sites of rich
and colorful cultural heritage. We should be very careful to
protect the historical relics in this area in accordance with the
policy of "focusing on the protection and excavation of key
cultural relics".
</P>
<P>
Leading cadres at all levels involved in the TGP or working in
the reservoir area should carry forward the spirit of utter
devotion and integrity, lead the masses of people in dauntless
struggles and forge ahead so as to turn the TGP into a first-class
project of water conservation and power generation in the world
while bringing forth a contingent of new talents in this field.
</P>
<P>
Comrades,
</P>
<P>
Doing a good job in building the Three Gorges Project is an
important mission history has entrusted on us and also our highest
honor. Let us, guided by the spirit of the Party's 15th National
Congress and holding high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping
Theory, work hard in unity and make fresh and greater
contributions to the construction of the Three Gorges Project, the
socialist modernization program and the realization of the great
cause of national rejuvenation.

<HEADLINE> Seoul Stock Market Crashes as Won Slides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seoul, November 8 (Xinhua) -- As Seoul stock market crashed
again and the local currency hit an all-time low against the
U.S. dollar Friday, financial experts said the stock market had
entered a vicious cycle once more amid growing concerns over the
uneasy financial market.
</P>
<P>
The local currency, despite the central bank's support efforts,
lost 5.1 won to finish at 979.9 against the dollar, the lowest
since the nation introduced the market average exchange rate
system.
</P>
<P>
The composite stock price index nosedived 38.24 points, or 6.9
percent, to close at 515.63, marking the biggest loss for a day in
South Korea's stock market history, after a short four-day rising.
</P>
<P>
"The won's fall can be attributed mostly to psychological
factors resulting from sharp plunges in share prices in other
Asian countries," said Lee Eung-baek, chief of the foreign
exchange division at the central Bank of Korea.
</P>
<P>
The won was under strong pressure to fall due to growing
corporate demand for the greenback as well as merchant banks'
active buying of dollars to ease their shortages of foreign
currency, he added.
</P>
<P>
Financial analysts attributed the plunge in share prices to the
won's continuing weakness, a series of corporate insolvencies,
market interest rates rising and the falling of share prices in
other Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
As the won continued to slide, foreign investors dumped shares
across-the-board, pulling down the composite stock price index,
and the news that stock prices in Japan had also plunged
significantly further deepened the decline.
</P>
<P>
They also said investors went on panic selling on worries about
a sudden rebound of 84.95 points in a four-day rally from Saturday
and gloomy market fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
They also blamed some foreign press reports, claiming that the
bourse was negatively affected by the reports, which painted a
grey picture for the South Korean financial system and its economy.
</P>
<P>
Most of them, however, agreed that the basic reason for the
plunge was the nation's uneasy financial market marked by weak won
and high-cost and low-efficiency economic fundamental.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's intervention was blamed to be not enough to
prop up the won as the Japanese yen's decline against the
greenback continued to weigh on the South Korean unit.
</P>
<P>
If the central bank fails to defend the won, and the ongoing
corporate financial squeeze, political unrest and foreign
sell-offs continue, the local bourse may plunge again below the
psychologically-important 500-point level and even further, they
said.
</P>
<P>
While the central bank says it has ample ammunition to defend
the won, some local press reports are raising worries over its
ability given the bank's low foreign exchange reserves, standing
at 30 billion dollars as it announced several days ago.
</P>
<P>
The won's fall is likely to continue for the time being without
an early recovery of foreign investors' confidence in the South
Korean economy, they said.
</P>
<P>
The surest way to stop the won's further fall is to strengthen
the nation's economic fundamentals by speeding up industrial
restructuring, the experts added.

<HEADLINE> Hashimoto Leaves For Saudi Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto left for Saudi Arabia this morning on a two-day visit to
boost ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia's capital, Hashimoto is
expected to meet with King Fahd and hold talks with Saudi
government officials.
</P>
<P>
Japanese government officials said the trip is aimed at
creating a "comprehensive partnership" with Saudi Arabia, a key
supplier of crude oil to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia accounted for 22.3 percent of the 1.7 billion
barrels of crude oil Japan imported in 1996, making it the second
biggest supplier to Japan after the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto is also expected to outline a Japanese proposal to
negotiate an investment protection accord with Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Japan is the second largest investor in Saudi Arabia following
the United States, with a total investment of 104.9 billion yen
(about 937 million U.S. dollars), Finance Ministry statistics
showed.
</P>
<P>
Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a leading Japanese economic daily,
reported today that the Japanese partner of a joint petrochemical
project in Saudi Arabia plans to invest an additional 150 billion
yen (about 1.2 billion dollars) to boost production.

<HEADLINE> Jiangsu's Nuclear Power Station Site Passes Safety Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The site chosen for the
construction of China's biggest nuclear power station in
Lianyungang, a port city of east China's Jiangsu province, has
passed a safety test by the China National Nuclear Safety
Administration.
</P>
<P>
This has laid a foundation for this state project to organize
feasibility studies, said an official from the On-the-Spot Work
Coordinative Group of the Lianyungang Nuclear Power Station.
</P>
<P>
The site of the nuclear power station is decided to be set on
Pashantou of Gaogongdao Township to the southeast of Lianyungang
City.
</P>
<P>
The China National Nuclear Safety Administration has carried
out strict inspections involving many factors that might affect
safety in the operation of the nuclear power station, including
earthquakes, floods, transportation, water diversion, resettlement
of residents and institutions, adjustment of urban economic
construction and development plans.
</P>
<P>
The Lianyungang Nuclear Power Station will have a total
generating capacity of six million kw and will be constructed in
three stages.
</P>
<P>
For the first stage construction, two sets of nuclear power
generating units, each having a generating capacity of one million
kw, will be installed. When first-stage construction is
completed, the station will be able to generate 15 billion
kw/hours of electricity a year.
</P>
<P>
The first stage is expected to cost 30 billion yuan, and
equipment, technology and some funds will be introduced from
overseas.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the nuclear power station will advance economic
development of east China, especially that of Jiangsu Province,
said officials.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Resettle 40,000 Families in Next Five </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe government will
resettle 40,000 families in the next five years as it battles to
curb the problems of squatting and congestion in the communal
areas, a cabinet minister said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Local government and national housing minister John Nkomo told
the Zimbabwe News Agency that the government was currently
resettling 8,000 households annually, and hoped to significantly
reduce the number of squatters before the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
His ministry would make consultations with the Ministry of
Lands and Agriculture and rural district councils to identify
suitable land for resettlement purposes.
</P>
<P>
"We are making progress on our resettlement programme," said,
Nkomo, adding, "By the year 2001 we would have greatly
de-congested our communal areas".
</P>
<P>
He said the population density in most communal areas had
risen to unacceptable levels while there was a lot of idle land
which was very suitable for human settlement.
</P>
<P>
War veterans would also benefit from the resettlement exercise
as the issue of land was central to the war of liberation which
they had fought, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government would take urgent steps to resolve the housing
problem which had grown to unacceptable levels, said Nkomo.
</P>
<P>
According to current estimates, Zimbabwe's population is 12.4
million, of whom one million in urban areas need houseing.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Proud Substitute Moms of Giant Pandas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese people usually
celebrate the 100th day of a baby's life by offering wishes of a
long and healthy life to the infant.
</P>
<P>
When scientists and workers from Beijing Zoo gave a 100-day
party for giant panda Ben Ben on Thursday, they extended the same
goodwill to the artificially-bred animal born at the zoo this
summer.
</P>
<P>
Giant pandas, known as China's "living fossils," are among the
most endangered wild animals in the world. There are only about
1,000 giant pandas living today.
</P>
<P>
Ben Ben was taken away from his mother Yong Yong shortly after
birth. Yong Yong, 16 years old and at the time in poor health,
could not produce enough milk to feed her offspring, and Ben Ben's
twin died a few days after it was born.
</P>
<P>
Wildlife experts at the zoo raised Ben Ben, providing vigilant
round-the-clock care.
</P>
<P>
Ben Ben is the 33rd giant panda successfully artificially bred
by Beijing Zoo since 1963.
</P>
<P>
"It is very difficult for artificially-raised giant pandas to
mate naturally," said Huang Shiqiang, a senior researcher on
animals at Beijing Zoo.
</P>
<P>
Giant pandas normally get pregnant once a year and produce one
or two babies at each birth. Huang said giant pandas have a very
low reproduction rate because females are in heat for only a short
period and often reject the amorous advances of their mates. Giant
pandas are in heat only once a year and the oestrus lasts three to
five days.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to Chinese scientists' efforts in studying reproduction
of giant pandas, over 120 giant pandas, or one out of every ten,
have been raised in a man-made environment.
</P>
<P>
Found only in China, most giant pandas live in the juncture of
southwest China's Sichuan province and northwest China's Gansu and
Shaanxi provinces, and nearby regions. About 80 percent of the
endangered species live in Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
At the Chengdu Giant Panda Reproduction Research Base located
in Sichuan, scientists have successfully bred 42 giant pandas by
artificial insemination since 1980.
</P>
<P>
The breeding base, modeled after the pandas' natural habitat,
is the only research institute of giant panda reproduction in
China. Researchers here are working on ways to enhance the giant
pandas' sexual desire and performance, improve the survival rate
of baby giant pandas, and fine-tune current methods of artificial
insemination.

<HEADLINE> China-aided Irrigation Project Handed to Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Over 1,000 Zimbabwean officials
and local people hailed the handover of China-aided Valley Dam
and Irrigation Scheme at Valley in Matabeleland Province of west
Zimbabwe on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Valley Dam and Irrigation Scheme lies at 100 km southeast
of Bulawayo, the country's second largest city, upstream of Mwewe
River and six km away from Kezi town. The capacity of the dam is
5.88 million cubic meters with effective capacity of 3.8 million
cubic meters. The irrigation area of the scheme is 205 hectares.
</P>
<P>
At the handover ceremony, Chinese ambassador to Zimbabwe Liu
Guijin said that the scheme is a new project of cooperation
between the Chinese government and the Zimbabwean government.
</P>
<P>
China has provided an interest free loan of 49.6 million RMB
(about 6.2 million U.S. Dollars) with a 20 year maturity to the
project.
</P>
<P>
He said the project was successfully completed, thus becoming
another milestone of the great friendship between the peoples of
China and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his belief that with joint efforts, the friendly
relations and cooperation between the two countries will be
further consolidated and strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Minister of Rural Resources and Water Development
J. Mujuru said the generosity and goodwill of the Chinese
government and people further cemented the excellent political
and economic ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
She looked forward to further cooperation in developing
Zimbabwe's water resources with China.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Tea Output Expected to Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's tea production this
year is expected to drop by between 30 and 35 percent due to
erratic weather conditions, according to a Daily Nation report
today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Chairman of the East African Tea Trade
Association E.G. Karanja as saying that last year tea farmers in
Kenya realized a record production of 257,000 tons of tea.
</P>
<P>
He noted that towards the close of the year, the tea yield
dropped by 40 percent below the projected output following the
serious drought experienced during the last short and long rain
seasons.
</P>
<P>
Karanja who is also Managing Director of the Kenya Tea
Development Authority said that it is difficult to predict what
next year holds for the tea industry.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Mombasa Tea Auction had grown to an
international blending floor, ranking second to Colombo with
London coming a distant third.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan official noted that his association was happy with
such a development, which he attributed to a favorable auction
prices.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Set Up More Export Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will set up three more
export processing zones (EPZs) within the next two years to
provide additional facilities for investors from both home and
abroad, sources from the Bangladesh Export processing Zone
Authority (BEPZA) said here today.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by BEPZA Executive Chairman Moazzem Hossain
Khan while addressing an investors' conference Friday.
</P>
<P>
The existing two export processing zones in Chitagong and Dhaka
are unable to cope with the increasing demand from investors, the
executive chairman said.
</P>
<P>
The BEPZA was formed in 1980, and the first EPZ -- Chittagong
Export processing Zone (CEPZ) -- became operational in 1983. The
Dhaka Export Processing Zone (DEPZ) was commissioned in 1993.
</P>
<P>
In the two export zones, 104 industries are in full operation
and 93 industries are in different stages of construction, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Actual investments in the two zones so far are 265 million U.S.
dollars and proposed investments are estimated at 781 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises in the zones now employ about 60,000 workers and
others, the number is to be raised to 106,000 when all units go
into operation, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Export earnings from the EPZs during fiscal 1996-97 were 463
million dollars, accounting for 10.5 percent of the country's
total export.
</P>
<P>
The BEPZA predicted that the current fiscal year's earnings
would reach 700 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Chinese VCD Maker Buys Pricey TV Ads for 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 8 (Xinhua) -- A leading Chinese VCD maker
today offered 210 million yuan to become owner of China's most
expensive television advertisements to be aired in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In public bidding, the Guangdong IDALL Electronics
Co. Ltd. outbid 124 rivals to win a year's-worth of primetime,
five-second advertisement slots on China Central Television
Station's (CCTV) channel 1.
</P>
<P>
The Guangdong enterprise also has the right to air some ads on
other CCTV channels for the purchase price, which is 130 million
yuan higher than the bidding floor price of 80 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The only television station covering and broadcast to the whole
country, CCTV has long been a gold mine for advertisers, who hotly
pursue it. Last year, China's TV ad turnover reached 9.7 billion
yuan (116.86 million US dollars), more than a third of which came
from the station.
</P>
<P>
China's primetime viewing hour is from 7 to 8 p.m., when
popular programs as well as news and weather forecasts attract
more than 400 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
The bidding for the "King Advertisement" as it has been dubbed
has been run for four consecutive years by CCTV, annually catching
widespread public attention.
</P>
<P>
In the biddings for the last three years, purchasers were all
China's liquor distilleries. Qinchi Distillery of Shandong
Province set an advertisement record of 320 million yuan for 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, today's bidding for the first time banned distilleries
from participating. "We ban distilleries from prime time ads in
line with government control on liquor ads," explained Tan Xisong,
Director of CCTV's Advertising Department.
</P>
<P>
Public bids were accepted for today's bidding for the country's
No. One ad, as opposed to the secret bidding process used
previously.
</P>
<P>
"The change enables the process to be more transparent and
provides more chances for the competitors," Tan noted.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here hailed the bidding as a success, pointing out it
reflects the fair-play of the market economy, and will help ease
the high demand for ads on CCTV and be helpful in handling
situations of advertising fraud.
</P>
<P>
Secret bidding for CCTV's other prime time items were also held
today.

<HEADLINE> Economic Development in Full Swing in Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Central China is a key area
for a new round of economic reforms in China, a noted Chinese
economist said here today.
</P>
<P>
Central China has fine advantages in economic development, said
Ma Hong, who has been involved in making an economic blueprint for
the area.
</P>
<P>
The area covers nine provinces including Henan, Hubei, Hunan
and Anhui provinces and Chongqing Municipality. Its population
accounts for two fifths of the national total.
</P>
<P>
It scored fast economic growth in recent years. Its gross
domestic product made up 27 percent of the country's total in
1995, Ma said at a seminar attended by economists from China and
the Republic of Korea, held recently in this capital city of
central China's Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth rate of Anhui province proceeded all other
areas in China and that of Jiangxi, Henan and Hubei provinces were
all in the forefront of growth.
</P>
<P>
The central government has allocated huge funds for economic
development in central China, which boasts rich natural resources
and cheaper labor compared with the eastern part of China.
</P>
<P>
ROK enterprises have shown keen interest in cooperation with
Hunan in the fields of energy, electronics and
telecommunications. The two sides have signed contracts on 25
projects involving an overseas investment of 200 million US
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Chuan Poised to Be Thailand's New PM: Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Democrat Party
leader and former prime minister Chuan Leekpai was poised to be
Thailand's new prime minister as he announced Friday he had
secured pledges of a majority parliament support, local newspapers
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The number of the lower house members who pledged to support
Chuan have increased to 212 after some members of the two ruling
parties - the Social Action Party (SAP) and the Prachakorn Thai
(Thai Citizen) Party (PTP) defected to Chuan, the Bangkok Post, a
leading English language newspaper, said.
</P>
<P>
The support included 123 signatures from Chuan's own Democrat
Party, 39 from the Chart Thai (Thai Nation) Party (CTP), 20 from
the SAP, 16 from the PTP, eight from the Solidarity Party, four
from the Seritham (liberal democratic) Party, and one each from
the Thai Party and the Palang Dharma (virtue force) Party (PDP),
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The next step will be procedural, which will hinge on the role
of House Speaker Wan Muhamad Nor Matha today as the caretaker
coalition led by the New Aspiration Party (NAP) is expected to
challenge the validity of the signatures backing Chuan, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Some parliament members, including those from the PTP and the
PDP, gave their signature support to Chuan without the approval of
their party leaders, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Caretaker Deputy Prime Minister and PTP leader Samak Sundaravej
was expected to stand by the list of his party's 18 signatures
given to Chart Chattana (national development) Party leader
Chatichai Choonhavan to support him as new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The signature of PDP's sole parliament member Sudrat Keyuraphan
might face challenges as it was made without the approval of PDP
leader Chaiwat Sinsuwong, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Wan Nor, who is also deputy leader of the NAP, has asked party
leaders to present their lists supporting any contenders for the
premiership to follow a tradition in Thai politics, which might
break up the current line-up led by Chuan, the newspaper added.
</P>
<P>
The Nation, another leading English-language newspaper, said
that a new government expected to be led by Chuan is taking shape.
</P>
<P>
Chuan would submit the names of the 212 parliament members'
signatures to Wan Nor to form a new government, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
Wan Nor is expected to present a nomination for new prime
minister to Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej for approval soon.
</P>
<P>
Chuan previously served as prime minister between 1992 and
1995.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The Indian textile industry
favors a cut in the number of cotton varieties grown in the
country in order to focus on improving the cotton quality, textile
industry sources said today.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 varieties of cotton are grown throughout the
country with the top 25 accounting for 90 percent of the total
production.
</P>
<P>
The industry believes that existence of many varieties causes
mixing of cotton both fraudulently and inadvertently. it also
leads to mixing of seeds resulting in erosion of varietal purity,
difficulty in cotton marketing and confusion among mills in
choosing varieties for spinning different count of yarns.
</P>
<P>
Technological properties of many varieties have deteriorated
and older varieties are showing higher deterioration characterized
by reduction in fiber length, changed micronaire value and reduced
strength.

HANOI, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is to use a new flexible

The move was prompted by a sharp fluctuation in the value of
the dollar in international markets, according to a local report

Individuals or companies making payments to the state are
eligible to calculate payments by using the spot rate announced by

On a 352-65 vote Friday night, the House passed an 80.2 billion
U.S. dollars spending bill for the Education, Health and Human
Services and Labor departments, requesting the delay of the tests
to fourth graders on reading and eighth graders on math.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the legislation "moves us down the road to high
national standards and voluntary tests in basic skills."
</P>
<P>
The passage of the bill had delayed because of dispute between
the House and the administration over the voluntary tests. The
passage of the bill, which covers the budget year that started
October 1, lets work continue on developing the tests and calls
for an independent study of whether an array of existing state and
commercial tests may do the work of a federally sponsored version.
</P>
<P>
Clinton claimed that the tests are needed because there is no
uniform measure, based on uniform standards, that let parents know
how their children and schools are performing.
</P>
<P>
The Senate was expected to vote the bill as early as Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Dini Calls for Greater Italian Presence in European </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini said today it may be time for an Italian to take the top spot
at the European Commission.
</P>
<P>
"We haven't held the post of president of the European
Commission for 27 years," Dini told reporters on the sidelines of
the "Trans-Atlantic Business Dialogue" conference here.
</P>
<P>
The mandate of Jacques Santer -- the current commission
president from Luxembourg -- will expire in 1999. The European
Commission is the executive body of the 15-member European Union.
</P>
<P>
On a Europe-wide debate over who should head the future
European central bank, Dini noted his country will "consider the
possibility of presenting its own candidate at the opportune
moment."
</P>
<P>
He said as Italy was almost sure to join the single currency
from its launch in 1999, "it seems logical that Rome should think
about being present here too."
</P>
<P>
Dini's words came a day after Italian Prime Minister Romano
Prodi told reporters that Italy was "under-represented in
international institutions."
</P>
<P>
Prodi's statement was "a clear signal that Italy wants to be
present at the highest institutional levels and that it has the
people to do it," said Dini.
</P>
<P>
Dini also urged his European partners to be aware that an
Italian presence in this context is important.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Gives Go-Ahead to Postponed Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
has reversed a September decision to postpone the development of
four private power plants and other projects worth 2 billion U.S.
dollars, official sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The sources quoted a presidential decree issued Friday night as
saying that "these projects that were under review or postponed
... have now been changed so that they can go forward."
</P>
<P>
The contracts were among a number of infrastructure projects
worth 17 billion dollars which the government in September said
would be postponed to rein in the current account deficit and
reduce costs.
</P>
<P>
Another eight "under review" projects worth more than 3 billion
dollars were also given the go-ahead under the latest government
decree.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the government never specified what "under
review" and "postponed" actually meant in the September decree,
which left the door open for companies to lobby to keep their
projects on track.
</P>
<P>
They added that the main reason behind the September
postponement was the devaluation of the rupiah, the country's
currency, which made companies more difficult to obtain financing.
The rupiah has dropped sharply following speculative attacks on
currencies in Southeast Asian countries in July and its value has
fallen by about 40 percent since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced on October 31
that Indonesia would get 23 billion dollars in financial and
technical assistance to cope with its monetary crisis.

<HEADLINE> COSCO Reshuffles to Be More Competitive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The China Ocean Shipping
(Group) Co (COSCO) launched a structural reform to maintain its
place in a sluggish worldwide shipping market.
</P>
<P>
COSCO Container Lines, ranking fourth in the world in
transportation volume, will move to Shanghai from Beijing and
combine with Shanghai Ocean Shipping Co., according to today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
A new firm will be set up in Shanghai with the reshuffle of the
two old firms. It will focus on the management of COSCO's
worldwide container transport service, said COSCO spokesman Gao
Weijie.
</P>
<P>
Container vessels of COSCO's other branch companies, such as
Guangzhou Ocean Shipping Co in south China and Tianjin Ocean
Shipping Co neighboring Beijing, will be transferred to the new
firm.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the world's top bulk carrier, COSCO Bulk
Carrier Co Ltd., will move to Tianjin from Beijing to combine with
Tianjin Ocean Shipping Co., Gao said.
</P>
<P>
The combined new firm will buy the shares of COSCO's other
current branch companies in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Tianjin and east
China's Qingdao city.
</P>
<P>
The new firm will try to get listed in Shanghai next year.
</P>
<P>
As part of the reform package, Guangzhou will become COSCO's
dry bulk transport center. Dry bulk carriers of COSCO's branch
companies will be under the united management of Guangzhou Ocean
Shipping Co.
</P>
<P>
Gao said that COSCO hopes the structural reform, which comes
during hard times for international ocean shipping carriers, will
help further improve COSCO's service quality and raise its
economic efficiency.
</P>
<P>
COSCO's total assets as of 1997 have risen 180 percent compared
with that of 1992. It has set up branches or offices in more than
12,000 ports in about 160 countries and regions.

SANDOUPING (Three Gorge 11:01 AM), November 8 (Xinhua) -- The
currents become swifter and more rapid as the gaps are narrowed
down. Suddenly, a small part at one side of cofferdam upstream
downslided after a truckful of rocks and gravels were dumped into
the water.
</P>

But, according to an engineer working on the spot, the

<HEADLINE> U.S. Accused of Dumping Chicken in Panama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Panama Poultry Producers
National Association President Pedro Gordon today accused the
United States of dumping chicken in the country.
</P>
<P>
Describing the situation as worrying, Gordon said more than
20,000 tons of U.S. chicken were exported to Guatemala, far
exceeding a 10,000-ton quota.
</P>
<P>
"The strange thing in this matter is that in the Guatemalan
chicken producers' imports records appear 10,000 tons, negotiated
through the World Trade Organization (WTO), but in the
U.S. exports records the figure is 20,000 tons," said Gordon.
</P>
<P>
The president said the 11th National Poultry Producers Congress
held here today will try to think of some ways to prevent the
damage.
</P>
<P>
Panama's poultry industry produces more than 750,000 chickens a
week and more than 12 million dozens of eggs a year. Each year it
creates more than 5,000 direct jobs and earns some 39.5 million
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Jiang's Visit Really Quite Successful, U.S. Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The recent U.S. visit of
Chinese President Jiang Zemin was very successful in terms of both
concrete progress and future cooperation between the two
countries, a senior official from the State Department said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Susan L. Shirk, deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau of
East Asia and Pacific Affairs, said at a press conference that
"From our perspective, we feel that the visit was really quite
successful in both of those aspects: the concrete progress on a
broad range of issues and laying down a good foundation for future
cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Jiang visited seven cities in the United States from October 26
to November 3, the first Chinese head of state to tour the largest
developed country in 12 years. During his visit, Jiang met with
President Bill Clinton and they issued a joint statement
underlining their determination to build a constructive strategic
partnership in the next century.
</P>
<P>
"From the U.S. government perspective, we do view this as an
important milestone in the development of the U.S.-China
relationship," said Shirk, also an author of several books on
China.
</P>
<P>
"We are really attempting to return to a relationship where
meetings are just business as usual...to address common problems,
as well as address differences," she said.
</P>
<P>
However, the administration's policy toward China has been
under criticism at the House of Representatives, where a package
of nine anti-China bills was passed in the last three days.
</P>
<P>
Defending the government's official position of engagement
toward China, Shirt said that she shared the concerns with the
congressmen over human rights, trade and proliferation, but
believed the approach proposed in these bills would be "very much
counterproductive."
</P>
<P>
"I would not read too much into these votes. And the
administration has worked very hard to argue our approach to
addressing these concerns, rather than the approach proposed in
the bills," said she, who was present in the House for three
separate sessions and markup to make the official views heard.
</P>
<P>
She expressed the belief that the Senate will not act on these
bills and they will therefore not become law.
</P>
<P>
The bills require endorsement from the Senate and signature
from the president before becoming law. The U.S. administration
has voiced opposition to most of the bills while the Senate is not
expected to take up any of them at least this year.

<P>
SANDOUPING (Three Gorges), November 8 (Xinhua) -- The current
flow rate through the gap between the two sections of the upstream
cofferdam has been increasingly smaller and exerted no substantial
negative impact on the damming, launched one and half hours ago.
</P>
<P>
Guo Yibing, chief engineer of the Hydrological Department of
the Yangtze River Water Conservation Committee, made this remark.
</P>
<P>
The hydrologic data processing center, therefore, will not
release any more hydrologic data, he said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Guo said, the center will keep a close watch on
any changes in the water flow through the gap, so as to record
today's data and put them on file.

<HEADLINE> El Nino Not to Affect Shipping on Panama Canal: Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The Panama Canal Commission
said today all the necessary measures have been taken to mitigate
the effects of the El Nino phenomenon on the interoceanic waterway
in the next several months.
</P>
<P>
"So far this year the climate phenomenon has produced the
longest-lasting drought registered in many years, causing a 25
percent diminution of the water that flows toward the lakes that
feed the Canal," the commission said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
However, the commission said it had implemented actions to
conserve the water, such as eliminating the generation of energy
in the lake Gatun hydroelectric plants, using short-chamber
floodgating and reducing hydraulic assistance. This could save
more than three billion gallons of fresh water.
</P>
<P>
The commission said it was also exploring the possibility of
recycling water from one floodgate to the next.
</P>
<P>
The El Nino phenomenon usually results in extremely dry weather
in eastern Australia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and parts of the
Philippines, extremely heavy rainfall down the west coast of South
America and crop-withering drought in other parts of South America.
</P>
<P>
The phenomenon, caused by a sea current, brews up in the
southern Pacific every three to five years.

<HEADLINE> China to Build Trans-Regional Property Rights Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, November 8 (Xinhua) -- China is to set up a unified
market on the management of property rights in provinces along the
Yellow River by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The market is to cover nine provinces and cities which have
combined state-owned assets worth 500 billion yuan, Ding Riheng, a
market sponsor, said here today.
</P>
<P>
Provinces and cities in this area are endowed with rich natural
resources and a great number of technical personnel. The
establishment of the trans-regional market will make it possible
for well-performing enterprises to help small or unprofitable ones
overcome difficulties by reorganization of assets, thus promoting
different areas of economic growth, Ding said.
</P>
<P>
Operating under government supervision, the market will provide
information and consultancy for all members, offer guidance on
government policies and regulations and raise funds for
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The market will be operated mainly in three forms -- signing of
bonds after negotiation among enterprises, auction and transfer of
information.
</P>
<P>
Progress has been made in economic cooperation among provinces
in the Yellow River valley in the past decade, resulting in
contracts for 27,000 projects, which involved a total investment
of 24 billion yuan and the flow of 17,200 technical
personnel.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Revises Downward Economic Projection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's economic growth this
year has been revised downward to 0.6 percent from the previous
forecast of 2.5 percent due to the baht's instability, which is
driving up manufacturing costs, caretaking Finance Minister Kosit
Panpiemras said.
</P>
<P>
Due to the absence of new investment, Thailand in 1998 will
also register a meager growth of only 1 percent, Kosit said, the
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The previous forecast expected the economy to expand by 3.5
percent next year.
</P>
<P>
Higher costs will push inflation this year to as high as 12
percent compared to the previous forecast of 9.5 percent, Kosit
said.
</P>
<P>
But thanks to the baht's depreciation against the U.S. dollar,
exports will see a 3.2 percent growth against 2.8 percent
predicted earlier. Exports are expected to increase by 8 percent
next year mainly because of the weaker baht, he said.
</P>
<P>
As exports have surpassed imports, the current account deficit
for this year will shrink to only 3.9 percent of gross domestic
product (GDP) compared to the previous forecast of 5 percent, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The deficit will drop further to 1.7 percent next year, and in
some months Thailand may register a surplus, Kosit said.

<HEADLINE> Senators Urge Italy to Normalize Ties With Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 7 (Xinhua) -- A group of Italian senators,
including seven-time premier and former foreign minister Giulio
Andreotti, have urged the government to restore normal diplomatic
relations with Iran, the ANSA news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to these senators, the first step toward the
normalization of relations between the two countries would be the
sending of Italian ambassador back to Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Italy and other European Union countries called home their
ambassadors on April 10 following a sentence by a German court
saying that the then Iranian leadership was directly responsible
for ordering the assassination of four members of the Iranian
Kurdish opposition in a Berlin restaurant in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The court's sentencing also led the EU to suspend the "critical
dialogue" through which it had been trying to rebuild its
relations with Iran since late 1992 after the attack.
</P>
<P>
In a joint letter released here today, Andreotti and others
stated that the "political shift which has taken place in Iran,"
following the election this year of moderate Mohammed Khatami as
president of Iran, has created a new situation in which "Italy's
solidarity with Germany cannot last for long."
</P>
<P>
The new Iranian leadership, the Italian senators claimed, "has
shown greater openness toward Europe" and thus Italy's "national
interest and traditionally good diplomatic relations with Iran
risk being compromised."
</P>
<P>
The letter was released in view of the meeting of the
Italian-Iranian joint commission later this month.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The Handan Iron and Steel
Group in north China's Hebei province recently has been listed as
a pilot plant for the country's energy-saving program.
</P>
<P>
As a pioneer in the reform of China's state-owned enterprises,
the group was chosen by the Ministry of Metallurgy and the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC).
</P>
<P>
Large energy consumption is a common problem in state-owned
enterprises, according to a MOFTEC official, and the pilot program
aims to help lower consumption to international levels.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show the Handan Group has made major gains in
reducing energy use. In 1995, the group's annual production of
steel doubled that of 1991 to 2.2 million tons. Energy consumption
for the same period only increased by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
The official said the Handan Group should become one of the
leading iron and steel producers in the world in terms of
equipment and technology by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Liu Hanzhang, general manager of the group, said 1 billion yuan
will be invested in 15
 energy-saving projects by 2000.

Latin America and the Caribbean, said the United Nations Programs
for AIDS (UNAIDS).
</P>
<P>
UNAIDS revealed this at Thursday's symposium of the surveillance
network for the AIDS.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, AIDS will be the cause of 72.2 deaths per
100,000 persons between 15 and 44 years, while traffic accidents
will kill 45.7 persons per 100,000, according to UNAIDS
projections.
</P>
<P>
Brazil has registered so far this year 110,000 cases of persons
infected with the virus that causes AIDS, a figure that surpases
that of the other 18 Latin American countries together. The total
number of persons infected with AIDS in Latin America is 211,000.

<HEADLINE> River to Cut Through Desert Oil City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, November 8 (Xinhua) -- A 22 meter-wide river will be
digged and cut through Karamay, an oil city in northwest China's
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, said Chen Hanyang, deputy
director of the Xinjiang Petroleum Management Bureau.
</P>
<P>
"The river will help with water supply for the desert city,
providing conditions for cultivating 30,000 ha of farmland," he
added.
</P>
<P>
River digging has been going on since June, and the river flow
will come from the Ertix River through a 450 km-long irrigation
canal, which is also being built.
</P>
<P>
About 400 million cubic meters of water will be carried by the
river a year, providing western China's biggest petroleum base
with sufficient water supply for daily use and irrigation.
</P>
<P>
"The construction of the 3.8 billion yuan (about 470 million US
dollars) water diversion project has been in full swing, and water
will come through the Karamay river in 1999," said Chen.
</P>
<P>
The city's name, Karamay, means "black oil" in Uygur language,
and it is the only city in China which was named after oil.
</P>
<P>
With sharp temperature differences between winter and summer,
scarce precipitation, and high evaporation, the city suffers from
severe water shortage.

SANDOUPING, China -- China is to block the Yangtze River, the
world's third longest, here today at 9:00 a.m. (Beijing Time) for
the on-going Three Gorges Project.
</P>
<P>
The blockage is to cut the main riverbed of the Yangtze with
two upstream and downstream cofferdams, the sand-and-earth dikes.
The 182-meter-high dam and workshops of the north-shore power
station will be built on the area circled by the two cofferdams
and one concrete cofferdam erected at an islet in the Yangtze.
</P>

<P>
SANDOUPING (Three Gorges at 8:05 AM) November 8 (Xinhua) --
China is going to dam the Yangtze River, the world's third
longest, today, signaling the end of the first-phase construction
of the Three Gorges Project.
</P>
<P>
The project, the world's largest ever water control project, is
also China's most grandeur man-made miracle following the Great
Wall erected some 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The project, set to be completed in the year 2009, will enable
the Jingjiang River region, one of the country's economically
developed area, to combat catastrophic floods that may occur once
every century, becoming a shield to resist floods and protect 15
million people and 1.5 million hectares of farmland around the
Dongting Lake and on the Jianghan Plain, or the plain between the
Yangtze and Hanjiang rivers.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Power Station, labeled as the world's biggest
hydro-electric facility, will have an installed generation
capacity of 18.2 megawatts. The station will become the powerhouse
to provide continuous power for China's economy, greatly easing
the energy insufficiency in east and central China.
</P>
<P>
The future reservoir will markedly improve the navigation
channel along the Three gorges, increasing the yearly transport
capacity from the current 10 million tons to 50 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The construction period, divided into three phases, is to last
17 years till 2009. Formally launched on December 12, 1994, the
damming marked the end of the preparatory and first-phase
construction, lasting between 1993 and 1997. The six-year
second-phase construction from 1998 to 2003 is set to end when the
first set of power generation units in the power station at the
north shore start to generate electricity and the permanent
shiplock open to vessels. The operation of all 26-set turbine
generators, slated to start in 2009, marked the completion of the
whole massive project.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dollar Hits Six-Month High Against yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar climbed to a
six-month high against the Japanese yen Friday after a plunge in
Asian stocks, but dropped to five-month lows against the German
mark and Swiss franc.
</P>
<P>
The dollar also hit a second straight four-month low against
the British pound as a sharp drop in U.S. stock prices contributed
to the dollar's weakness against Europe's major currencies.
</P>
<P>
European currencies rose strongly against the yen Friday after
Tokyo stocks plummeted to a two-year low, which affected the
dollar's position. The pound set a second straight five-year high
against the Japanese currency.
</P>
<P>
In New York, the dollar was quoted at 124.22 yen, up from
123.03 late Thursday, to reach its highest level since May 7.
</P>
<P>
The dollar also was set at 1.7067 marks, down from 1.7234 to
its lowest point since June 9. The U.S. currency traded at 1.3912
Swiss francs, down from 1.4125, to its lowest level since May 20.
</P>
<P>
The pound was quoted at 1.6909 U.S. dollars, up from 1.6895
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday: 5.7140 French francs, down from 5.7715; 1,674.25 Italian
lire, down from 1,688; and 1.4108 Canadian dollars, up from 1.3975.

<HEADLINE> Ultralow-Tar Cigarettes Raises Speculation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philip Morris Cos., the
leading cigarette maker, plans to launch an ultralow-tar version
of its Marlboro cigarette in January next year, the Wall Street
Journal reported today.
</P>
<P>
The move raised speculation that the company, which has been
test-marketing Marlboro Ultra Lights for several years, is
scrambling to get the new product on the market before Congress
passes new tobacco legislation.
</P>
<P>
"We are launching Ultra Lights because we think it makes good
business sense and rounds out the brand portfolio," a company
spokeswoman said, adding Philip Morris wanted to offer consumer a
wide variety of choices.
</P>
<P>
Public-health officials have grown increasingly critical of
light and low-tar labels, arguing that they discourage people from
quitting and don't really reduce health risks to smokers,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Some critics even say light cigarettes aren't any better for
the health, and in some cases are worse than full-tar lines.
Smokers tend to cover up with their fingers the airholes punched
near low-tar cigarette filters, keeping out air that might have
diluted the smoke, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The paper also reported that the Federal Trade Commission is
moving to revise its rating system to disclose how much tar and
nicotine smokers are actually getting from light or low-tar
products.

<HEADLINE> Steep Rise in Xenophobic Incidents Reported in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The number of right-extremist and
xenophobic incidents involving German soldiers has almost tripled
this year compared with 1996, a German defense ministry spokesman
said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the German army's own account, about 126
right-extremist incidents involving 161 soldiers occurred in the
first 10 months of this year compared with 44 cases involving 56
soldiers for 1996, the German news agency DPA quoted a defense
ministry spokesman as saying today.
</P>
<P>
The incidents included drunken soldiers shouting "Heil Hitler",
arson against foreigners' hostels as well as beatings of
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe would set up a working
group next week to intensify supervision on the soldiers' conduct,
the ministry said.

<HEADLINE> NZ First Party Seeks Assurance on Coalition Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 8 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand First party
leader Winston Peters has indicated that he will seek assurance on
the key issues in the coalition agreement before offering his
party's support to National Party's new leader Jenny Shipley.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to business people in NZ's largest city Auckland
last night, he said his MPs want the coalition agreement its value
adhered to, such as keeping Television NZ One in public ownership
and a further boost in health spending, the local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
TVNZ was listed as a strategic asset not to be sold to the
private sector in the coalition agreement between NZ First and
National, and an increase in health spending was a key issue in
the accord.
</P>
<P>
He said there are still issues needing explanation and both
partners are hoping for a quick decision on their future.
</P>
<P>
Early in the week, Shipley replaced Prime Minister Jim Bolger
as National Party leader, and will become the new prime minister
at the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
But so far, New Zealand First has withheld support to Shipley.
Peters met with Shipley for an hour Friday and they will meet
again Monday.
</P>
<P>
Peters said his party needs the same commitment from National
and there will be no revision to the coalition agreement.

<HEADLINE> Greece to Stick to Strong Drachma Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas today stressed the need of a strong drachma policy
which would defeat the rumors of the imminent develuation of the
national currency.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the rumors to those trying to speculate and to
maintain a climate of uncertainty and confusion.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government would defend the drachma, he said, warning
that anyone who tried to play with the drachma would be
disappointed, perhaps even incur damages.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that the Greek economy could successfully
withstand whatever attacks were made on the drachma.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, The Greek Finance Ministry announced today that it
would issue a new series of one and three-year Eurobonds with a
fixed interest next Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also said that it would hold an auction of
one-year interest bearing bills totaling 100 billion drachmas
(about 3.64 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Bankers here believe that the Eurobond issue was a strategic
move by the government in order to improve the climate in the
domestic markets and also to reiterate its determination to
implement a hard-drachma policy.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Shipbuilders Fare Well in Currency Dip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 7 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's shipbuilding
industry stands to benefit from won's depreciation, industry
sources said.
</P>
<P>
South Korean yards, which aim at notching bookings of 10
million gross registered tons this year, have received orders of
8.72 million gross tons on 144 ships in the first eight months of
the year, the U.S. newspaper Journal of Commerce reported today.
</P>
<P>
The orders are valued at 5.3 billion U.S. dollars. Another
batch of orders valued at 4.2 billion dollars is nearing
completion, a spokesman at the South Korean Shipbuilders
Association was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The association believes that as the South Korean won has
fallen at a faster rate against the U.S. dollar than the Japanese
yen, the South Koreans are in a better position to compete.
</P>
<P>
The won-dollar exchange rate was off 12 percent at the end of
October while the yen was down about 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
If its goal can be met, South Korea will top the world list in
shipbuilding orders and surpass Japan for the first time since
1993, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
In the six months through September, Japanese yards received
export orders of 6.91 million gross tons on 156 ships against 3.81
million tons on 116 vessels a year earlier.

<P>
NEW YORK, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The New York stock market
retreated today following a resumed selloff in Asia and Brazil and
a report of the lowest U.S. unemployment in 24 years which
rekindled inflation fears.
</P>
<P>
The Dow plummeted 101.92 points at 7,581.32, a drop of 1.3
percent but a big improvement from midafternoon lows, when the Dow
dipped 195 points at one point. Even with the loss, the Dow
finished the week with a gain of 139 points and 17 percent on
the year.
</P>
<P>
Broader market indicators also fell sharply today. Preliminary
trading volume, while heavy at 564 million shares, was less than
half last week's most frantic levels.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-1 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 564.08 million
shares as against 522.18 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list dipped 16.68 to 921.35,
and the NYSE composite index fell 6.46 to 487.29.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index fell 21.08 to 1,602.36, and the
American Stock Exchange composite index dropped 9.44 to 678.27.
</P>
<P>
Markets in Hong Kong and South Korea also fell sharply today.
European markets also were lower.
</P>
<P>
In Latin America, Brazil's main index was off 10 percent to
trigger a trading halt in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
According to the government report, the U.S.'s unemployment
rate fell last month to a 24-year low of 4.7 percent, while the
number of new jobs created increased by 284,000, well above
analysts expectations. Financial markets worry that with labor in
short supply, wages and prices will rise.

<HEADLINE> IMF Okays Emergency Post-Conflict Aid to Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) today approved a credit for Albania equivalent to about
12 million U.S. dollars as the emergency post-conflict assistance,
to back the government's economic program for 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
The main objectives of the macroeconomic program for 1997-98
are rapid disinflation and resumption of economic growth -- to
limit the decline of real GDP to 8 percent in 1997 and achieve
real growth of about 12 percent in 1998, contain the annual
inflation rate to the range of 51 to 54 percent in 1997, and bring
it down to 15 to 20 percent in 1998, and keep gross international
reserves above the equivalent of 3.5 months of imports through
1998.
</P>
<P>
Albania joined the IMF in October 1991. Its quota is about 49
million dollars and its outstanding use of IMF financing currently
totals some 45 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: U.S. to Be Resolute and Firm Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 7 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton said
on Friday that the United States and its allies should be
"resolute and firm" in dealing with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
"We have to be resolute and firm... The international community
has made a decision, embodied in a United Nations resolution, that
Saddam Hussein must not be permitted to resume producing weapons
of mass destruction," Clinton said to reporters in Roosevelt Room at
the White House.
</P>
<P>
The United States has repeated its warnings that there could be
further economic sanctions or military action in case President
Saddam still refuse Americans to be in the three U.N. weapons
inspection teams.
</P>
<P>
"It would be a mistake to rule in or out any particular course
of action at this moment," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The president said that, prior to consider any action against
Iraq, he would first be waiting for a report from a U.N. three-man
team, now on its way back to New York after talks with Iraqi
officials in Baghdad over Iraq's barring of American inspectors.
</P>
<P>
U.S. allies should also be consulted with for any action to be
taken, and "give them a chance to be heard and see what we're
going to do," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Friday, Defense Secretary William Cohen said the
United Nations should take some action against Iraq for its
refusal to be in compliance with U.N resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. has to make a decision as to whether or not it would
seek to pursue greater economic sanctions against Saddam or indeed
consider authorizing military action," he said at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
He agreed that the United States also had to await a report
from the U.N. three-man team on their Baghdad mission before any
decision was made on how to proceed against Iraq.

WASHINGTON, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton Presidential
Library will be located on land near the Arkansas River in

<P>
Planning officials made the announcement after a six-month
review of 30 potential sites in the greater Little Rock area in
Arkansas, news reports said.

LONDON, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
extended Thursday's losses and closed this week deep in the red,
undermined by renewed weakness of Asian markets, Wall Street's
opening decline and strong US economic figures.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index ended nearly 100 points lower after
strong US economic data raised fears of an interest rate rise.
Fresh turmoil in Asian markets overnight also hit market
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
More than 17 billion pounds (28.7 billion US dollars) was wiped
out of the value of leading shares by the close of trade.
</P>
<P>
At one stage, the index had fallen by 164 points, erasing 29
billion pounds (49 billion US dollars) from share values but the
index recovered some composure to end down 99.5 points at 4,764.3,
a drop of 78.0 points from last week.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares fell sharply, dragged down by a
decline in Hong Kong, with the DAX-30 index ending 124.02 points
lower at 3,699.89, a fall of 26.8 points on last week.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that market sentiment remained fragile and
susceptible to falls elsewhere. A week dollar also exerted
downward pressure.
</P>
<P>
French shares in Paris dropped as US weakness and further
turmoil in Asia weighed on the market. The CAC-40 index closed off
its lowest points at 2,699.71, down 82.11 points on the day and
39.59 points on last Friday.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon: Iraqi Attack on U-2 Would Be "Act of War" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 7 (Xinhua) -- A senior Pentagon official
said today that any Iraqi attempt to shoot down a U-2 spy plane
would be considered an act of war and would be met with a military
response.
</P>
<P>
He was answering a question from a reporter who asked if the
United States would consider it an act of war if Iraq fired on the
spy plane. He made an affirmation: "Yes, in my opinion."
</P>
<P>
He said the Pentagon and the United Nations have worked out a
streamlined system -- a trigger mechanism -- that would allow a
military response if any U-2 flying over Iraq for U.N. weapons
inspection was fired upon.
</P>
<P>
A range of military options that could be taken against Iraq
have already been discussed, including the use of possible
Tomahawk cruise missile strikes, the senior Pentagon official
said.
</P>
<P>
He would not rule out a unilateral U.S. response, but noted
that the surveillance was a United Nations operation and said
President Bill Clinton would probably discuss options with U.N.
officials soon.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said earlier today that the United States and its
allies would be "resolute and firm" in dealing with Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein for his refusal of complying with U.N.
resolutions.
</P>

And his Defense Secretary William Cohen has already threatened
to take some action against Iraq. He indicated Thursday that
further economic sanctions or military action should be considered
by the U.N. Security Council.
