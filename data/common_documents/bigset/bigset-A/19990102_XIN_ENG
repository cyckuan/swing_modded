<HEADLINE> NBA Declines to Meet Face to Face with Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The NBA league told its
players union yesterday it will not agree to another face-to-face
bargaining session until the union submits a final offer in
writing to the league's labor relations committee.
</P>
<P>
The union declined, according to Jeffrey Kessler, its outside
counsel.
</P>
<P>
"That's not the way to negotiate in good faith," Kessler
said."It's too late for posturing and game playing. The parties
need to get together and reach a deal."
</P>
<P>
The league has set a January 7 deadline to cut a deal with its
players, who have been locked out for six months, or the season
likely will be canceled.
</P>
<P>
Yesterday's standoff developed after union chief Billy Hunter
and NBA commissioner David Stern talked by phone in early
afternoon, according to both sides.
</P>
<P>
Kessler said Hunter sought to convene the two sides'
bargaining committees for a final session before the January 7
deadline. Short of that, Hunter suggested he meet with either
Stern or deputy commissioner Russ Granik, both of whom are on
vacation in other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
To expedite matters, Hunter and Stern agreed to have Jeffrey
Mishkin, the NBA's chief legal officer who is in New York, call
Kessler.
</P>
<P>
Mishkin said he asked Kessler how he would deliver the final
proposal. Kessler said he told Mishkin the proposal wasn't quite
ready, but that he would be available to meet within the hour.
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'We've already given you our final offer,'" Mishkin
said. "There's nothing really to talk about. We'll pass it along
to the labor relations committee. I see no reason to meet since
you rejected our last offer.'"
</P>
<P>
Mishkin said he assured Kessler that the union's final
proposal, if submitted, would be considered by the full board of
governors at its January 7 meeting.
</P>
<P>
Stern tipped his strategy for yesterday's decision in
conference call with reporters Monday when he said the labor
relations committee, composed of eight owners, had rejected a
face-to-face meeting, but the 29 governors would consider
anything the union wished to submit in writing.
</P>
<P>
The union is seeking a restoration of the league's middle
class in salaries, less restrictive free agency than the league
has proposed during nine months of negotiations and the same
share of league revenues as it received last season.

<HEADLINE> Hun Sen Does Not Oppose Trying Khmer Rouge Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PEHN, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime Minister Hun
Sen said Friday that he is not opposed to the trial of Khmer Rouge
leaders.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen made the remarks in a statement broadcast on a local TV
Friday evening, which were seen as being directed at those who
opposed the government decision to welcome the recent defection
of Khmer Rouge leaders Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that his position on the trial of Khmer Rouge
leaders has not changed and will not change. At the same time, he
stressed that the trial of the Khmer Rouge should continue.
</P>
<P>
"I did not mention the trial of the Khmer Rouge leaders in my
recent talks, not because I have forgot it, but because I believed
the first thing we should talk about is peace, which is the most
need of the country and the Cambodian people," Hun Sen explained.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hun Sen said "Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea do not
need an amnesty before their defection, because they were not
convicted by any court or received any arrest warrant."
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen pointed out that the pair gave up their anti-government
struggles and returned to the society voluntarily, so they should
not be arrested. "We should not put all those who oppose the
government into the prison, instead to encourage them to
participate in the national construction," he said.
</P>
<P>
Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea defected to the royal government on
December 25 with assurances they would not be prosecuted. They
also received a warm welcome from Hun Sen when they arrived in
Phnom Penh and held nearly three-hours of talks with the prime
minister in his residence.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Needs $91 Million to Buy Emergency Food Supplies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania needs some 91.1million U.S.
 Dollars to buy emergency food supplies to augment the country's grain
stock in the first half of 1999, the central bank predicted Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to a monthly economic review report issued by the Bank of
Tanzania (BoT), the Strategic Grain Reserve (SGR) stood at 45,557 tons by
the end of last November, hitting the lowest level since it was set up in
1991.
</P>
<P>
The report largely attributed the shortage of food to floods caused
by El Nino phenomenon during 1997 and 1998, to insufficient short rains
during
the October and November last year, as well as to destructive pests.
</P>
<P>
Most of the country is suffering from a severe drought, except for
Kigoma Region in the west and some parts of the Lake Zone in the north
which have received some short rains.
</P>
<P>
President Benjamin Mkapa announced Thursday that the country has waived
maize import duty as a measure to deal with the food shortage situation.
</P>
<P>
In his New Year message to the nation Thursday night, Mkapa said the
country is short of 400,000 to 450,000 tons of food, or 25 to 30
percent below requirement.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa also encouraged businessmen to transport food from harvest regions
to grain deficit areas in the country, ordered local brewers not to use
food crops for production, and asked people not to be choosy about food,
saying cassava, plantain and yams should be consumed as well.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa advised people to prepare their farms as soon as possible and
plant drought resistant crops such as cassava and millets, adding that
valleys and lower basins should be used for crops cultivation.
</P>
<P>
BoT has predicted that overall inflation is expected to increase
gradually in the coming months on account of upward pressure on food prices
because of shortage in supplies of cereals, especially maize in the market.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye on Thursday evening cautioned
Tanzanians to be alert to counter the after effects of the current
drought which is likely to produce adverse impact on the country's
social and economic development.

<HEADLINE> Israel Has No Interest in Escalating Tensions in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Chief of General Staff
Shaul Mofaz told reporters Friday that Israel has no interest in
escalating tensions in south Lebanon, denying reports that the
Israeli army will strike infrastructures in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Mofaz made the remarks just one day after Israeli security
cabinet warned of a harsh response to possible guerrilla attacks
on northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported earlier Friday that the security cabinet
has adopted an Israeli army proposal that if Hezbollah guerrillas
fire rocket into Israel, the army will respond by hitting targets,
mainly infrastructures such as power stations in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after a meeting held late Thursday
night, the security cabinet said Israel holds Beirut "directly
responsible" for what happened in south Lebanon, demanding that
the Lebanese government stem guerrilla activities there and
prevent rocket attacks on Israel.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet decision to punish Beirut for possible guerrilla
attacks drew criticism from the opposition Friday. They said the
decision will spark another war between Israel and Lebanon which
will cause heavy loss of lives.
</P>
<P>
Former Israeli prime minister Shimon Peres said only diplomatic
solutions can resolve the current conflict in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Uzi Landau, a far rightist legislator, however, said the
cabinet decision was not harsh enough. If an attack on Lebanon's
infrastructure is not effective, he said, he will recommend an
escalation of Israeli strike against Lebanese military forces.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-declared security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
As Israeli casualties mounted in south Lebanon, the wisdom of
Israel's military presence there has become a contentious issue in
the country. Twenty-two Israeli soldiers were killed in the zone
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Many Israelis demand a unilateral withdrawal from south
Lebanon, arguing that the 15-kilometer-deep buffer zone, has
failed to provide security for northern Israel but become a source
of conflicts instead.
</P>
<P>
This view was driven home when Hezbollah guerrillas fired a
barrage of Katysusha rockets into northern Israel last week,
wounding 13 people, to retaliate the killing of a Lebanese woman
and six of her children in an Israeli bombing raid the previous
day.
</P>
<P>
But the Israeli government has conditioned a withdrawal on a
security arrangement with Beirut, saying a unilateral pullout will
expose its north to Hezbollah fires and endanger the future of
Israel's local militia allies, the South Lebanon Army.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and its main ally, Syria, have rejected Israel's
proposal, insisting that Israel withdraw from southern Lebanon
unconditionally.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin on Russia's Foreign Policy for 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
has outlined the main tasks of the Russian Foreign Ministry in
1999, the Itar-Tass news agency reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the New Year Yeltsin said these tasks include
stepping up integration in the Commonwealth of Independent States.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told journalists that the tasks
also include the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,
as well as Russia's role in the settlement of crises in Kosovo and
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about these conflicts, Ivanov pointed out the greatest
challenge here is to find a political formula for settling the
conflict within Yugoslavia, and to fully implement the U.N.
Security Council resolutions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The use of force will not help, Ivanov stressed, and will only
aggravate the situation.
</P>
<P>
The last task named by the president calls for invigorating
relations with European countries, primarily those in the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said that Russia attaches a great importance to the
Russian-U.S. dialogue as an important factor of stability in the
world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Russia will also develop relations with Asian partners,
primarily China, India and Japan, the minister said.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Railway Starts to Transfer Goods to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The first cargo train carrying
goods for central Asian states left Iran's southern port city of
Bandar Shahid Rajai in Hormozgan province Friday.
</P>
<P>
The train with 50 wagons carried tea, furniture and other goods
from the port city close to the provincial capital of Bandar Abbas
directly to the border city of Sarakhs with Turkmenistan, the
Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Abbas Fathollahi, director general of the railway in Hormozgan
province, said in a ceremony that Iran will dispatch a train of 50
wagons every Friday to transfer 4,000 tonnes of goods to Central
Asian states.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iranian railway has the capability to dispatch 50
wagons of goods every day from Shahid Rajai to Sarakhs, adding
that Iran can earn a transportation fee as much as the value of
300 barrels of oil from each wagon.
</P>
<P>
The railroad connecting Sarakhs and Bandar Abbas was
inaugurated in 1995, an important project for transferring
imported and exported goods of the land-locked Central Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
Fathollahi said that from March 20, the beginning of the
current Iranian calendar year, the Iranian railway has
transferred 250,000 tonnes of exported cotton from the Central
Asian countries to Bandar Rajai, registering a rise of 300
percent compared with the same period of last Iranian year.
</P>
<P>
Iran has announced Bandar Rajai as a special economic zone to
encourage foreign companies to transfer goods from and to the
Central Asian countries through the port city.
</P>
<P>
Director General of Ports and Navigation of the province Ali
Estiri also said at the ceremony that Iran has opened 10
international transportation lines to transfer goods directly from
Bandar Rajai special zone.

<HEADLINE> UK Summons Yemeni Ambassador over Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Yemen's ambassador to London was
summoned on Friday to the British Foreign Office for the second
time in two days for talks on the battle in Yemen in which three
Britons died.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Hussein al-Amri was told again of British
dissatisfaction over the incident.
</P>
<P>
Britain wanted to make clear of exactly what happened on
Tuesday. Officials said earlier that the government would be very
concerned if it turned out that its advice to seek a negotiated
solution to the kidnap saga was ignored.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Office Minister Joyce Quin summoned the Ambassador for
New Year's Day talks.
</P>
<P>
"This is to reinforce what we have already said. We attach
great importance to establishing what actually happened," a
Foreign Office official said.
</P>
<P>
"We want to clarify the discrepancies from the different
stories that have come from the hostages and the Yemeni
authorities," she added.
</P>
<P>
The four hostages were killled and two wounded on Tuesday when
Yemeni security forces raided a hideout where kidnappers were
holding a party of foreign tourists.
</P>
<P>
Yemen's interior ministry has said that there had been no time
for negotiations as the kidnappers had started killing hostages.

<HEADLINE> Tension over S-300 Missiles to Continue: Turkish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Turkish State Minister Sukru
Sina Gurel said Friday that the tension that erupted in the
region over the controversy surrounding the Russian-made S-300
missiles would continue.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that Greece and Greek Cyprus do not rule out the
possibility of using the missiles means that the tension in the
region will continue," the semi-official Anatolia News Agency
quoted Gurel as saying at a winter resort in Uludag mountains near
western province of Bursa.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish minister reiterated Ankara's determination not to
allow the S-300 missiles issue to be manipulated as a bargaining
chip against Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides announced Tuesday that he
had decided not to deploy the S-300 missiles in Cyprus and would
negotiate with Russia on possible deployment of the missiles
on the Greek island of Crete.
</P>
<P>
Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis said at the same day that
his country supported Clerides' decision.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus struck the missile deal with Russia in January 1997, in
a bid to cement its air defense capability.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, the close ally of independence-seeking Turkish Cypriots
in northern Cyprus, has threatened to launch preemptive strikes
on the missiles if they are brought to the divided island.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of the missiles in Cyprus has already been put off
several times under Turkish and international pressures.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriots-controlled
south and the Turkish Cypriots-dominated north after Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the country
in 1974 in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.

CAIRO, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
RAMALLAH -- Aid to the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) fell
in 1998 compared with the year before, according to the
Palestinian Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation,
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the drop to internal reasons of donor
states and obstacles planted by Israel to hinder certain projects,
Arabic daily Al Hayat reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The donor countries pledged at their Washington conference last
November to provide some 3 billion U.S. dollars to the PNA over
the coming five years.
</P>
<P>
SANAA -- Yemen expected higher unemployment rate in 1999 to
reach 32 percent. The number of the jobless will reach 1.1 million.
</P>
<P>
A recent Yemeni parliamentary report said that about 831,000
people, or 20.8 percent, of the labour force were out of work in
1998, Arabic-language newspaper Al Hayat reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Yemen decided last October to suspend employment temporarily in
government offices except the sectors of education, health and
services.
</P>
<P>
A recent employment survey conducted by the Civil Service
Ministry, in collaboration with the World Bank, revealed that the
number of civil servants is 415,000, 75 percent of whom are
employed by three ministries, namely, Health, Education, and
Construction and Housing.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanon earned a total of 750 billion Lebanese pounds
(about 500 million dollars) from post and telecommunications
services in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"The ministry (of post and telecommunications) has transferred
around 410 billion pounds (about 270 million dollars) to the
Treasury and used the rest to cover the salaries of ministry
staff and maintenance expenditures," the Daily Star quoted the
minister, Issam Naaman, as saying on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Naaman said his ministry will move from being the second
highest source of government revenue to the first in
1999. Lebanon's customs is the highest revenue earner.

<P>
KUNMING, January 2 (Xinhua) -- China's "Spring City", Kunming,
got a rare and unexpected sight of snow today, bringing jubilation
to local residents during their New Year celebrations.
</P>
<P>
The snow caused little inconvenience to local traffic, however,
as the snowflakes quickly melted after hitting the ground, and no
snow-related traffic accidents have been reported.
</P>
<P>
The capital of southwest China's Yunnan Province, Kunming has
spring-like weather year round because of its special topography,
with an average annual temperature of 14.5 degrees centigrade.
</P>
<P>
Kunming had its last snowfall in 1983 when more than 10
centimeters of thick snow covered the roads, according to one
taxi driver.
</P>
<P>
The local meteorological department attributed the rare snow to
cool air blowing down from Siberia, and said the temperature is
expected to rise again tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Trade with European Countries in Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Special Functions
Minister Daim Zainuddin said Saturday night that the country would
trade with the European countries in the Euro in future as an
alternative to using the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The government is prepared to use the Euro in line with efforts
to reduce the use of the dollar in trade, he said in Sungai
Petani, northern state of Kedah, according to the Malaysian
national news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
"We should reduce the use of the dollar because our trade with
the United States makes up only 18 percent of our total trade, but
70 percent of our dealings with other countries is conducted in
the dollar," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Daim said the use of the Euro was a good sign because it would
pose competition to the greenback.
</P>
<P>
The members of the European Union started using the Euro as a
single currency in all their trading Friday.

<HEADLINE> Estonia Halts Water Supply to Russian City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Estonia Saturday stopped water
supply to and treatment of sewage from neighboring Ivangorod, of
Russia's Leningrad region, due to a debt of 1.5 million U.S.
dollars, news agencies reported.
</P>
<P>
Ivangorod has switched to its own water supply system but may
have to discharge the city's sewage to the Narva River, which
falls into the Gulf of Finland, threatening an environmental
disaster.
</P>
<P>
Ivangorod and Narva used to share water intake and sewage
treatment facilities in Soviet times. After the Soviet Union
collapsed in 1991, Estonia has been supplying Ivangorod with water
on a contract basis.
</P>
<P>
This was the second time for the Estonian Narva Vesi company to
stop water supply to Ivangorod.
</P>
<P>
On November 10, Narva Vesi cut off water supply to the Russian
city for the first time, forcing the local government to
contemplate evacuating the city's 10,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
The Russian and Estonian governments agreed then that Narva
Vesi would continue to meet 25 percent of the city's daily water
need under a contract that expired on December 31.
</P>
<P>
Water supply was further cut to 5 percent in December,
Itar-Tass said.
</P>
<P>
Narva Vesi said it sent a draft new contract to the Ivangorod
administration in early December, but had not received any
feedback.
</P>
<P>
Ivangorod consumes 6,800 cubic meters of water each day. The
daily amount of sewage exceeds 8,000 cubic meters, Interfax said.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Secretary
Shamshad Ahmad Khan arrived here Saturday morning to discuss with
Iranian officials issues such as Afganistan, terrorism and the
assassination of Iranian nationals in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He will also convey a message from Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif to Iranian President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, Ahmad Khan expressed hope that during his
two-day stay in Tehran he will be able to "remove any misgivings
or misunderstanding and thereby strengthen the historic friendship
and cooperation between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Khan said there are some misunderstandings between the
two countries and Pakistan has always followed a stable policy
toward Iran based on deep friendship.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Iran and Pakistan cooled down following a
series of assassinations of Iranian citizens in Pakistan and the
killings of eight Iranian diplomats and an Iranian reporter in
Afghanistan by the Pakistan-backed Taliban forces in last August.
</P>
<P>
During the past three years, a number of Iranian citizens were
assassinated in Pakistan. The latest case happened in last
February, in which two Iranian engineers in charge of a bridge
construction project in Karachi were shot dead by unidentified
gunmen.
</P>
<P>
Iran has lodged strong protest to the Pakistani government
over the killings and urged Islamabad to take serious measures to
punish the killers and ensure security for Iranian citizens
living in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister for Asia-Pacific
Affairs Mohsen Aminzadeh said that confidence-building talks are
needed between the two sides in order to restore and maintain
their relations and overcome the misunderstandings.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Sets 1999 as "Crime Prevention Year" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The year 1999 has been set as "Crime
Prevention year" by the Zambian government , Zambia Daily Mail reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
While announcing the decision, Zambian Home Affairs Permanent Secretary
Joseph Kasongo said at Lusaka's Cathedral of the Holy Cross Friday night
that there could be no meaningful economic development without the
community's political support and operational assistance in crime
prevention.
</P>
<P>
He said that the crime prevention strategy required the integrated
efforts of the police, families, schools, neighborhood associations and
businesses in order to improve the quality of people's lives.
</P>
<P>
However, Kasongo noted that a worrying feature in 1998 was the increase
in violent crimes involving the use of fire arms.
</P>
<P>
And Commissioner of police Silus Ngangula said the police needed to
develop a new relationship with the law abiding people in the community by
allowing them a greater voice in setting local priorities.
</P>
<P>
He said a large proportion of police time and activity are being
channeled to crime prevention due to crimes' impact and consequences on the
general public.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president of the Crime Prevention Foundation of Zambia,
Francis Musonda, said his organization was committed to making Zambia a
better place to live in by creating safer cities, townships and villages in
order to attract more investment.

KAMPALA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Inspector-General of Police Cossy
Odomel has said that he will resign soon from the top police post and live
a normal civilian life, Radio Uganda reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He made the shocking remarks at an annual party hosted for senior police
officers at Mamboole Sports Hotel here Friday, said the radio.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Press Secretary Hope Kivengere told Xinhua Saturday that
she does not know the matter and does now know whether President Yoweri
Museveni has received Odomel's resignation.
</P>
<P>
Radio Uganda's Editor-in-Chief of the Current Affairs Section Samuel
Muwanguzi said Saturday afternoon that the police boss is accused of office
abuse and corruption.
</P>
<P>
He has some companies which are doing business with the police and he is
now under investigation, Muwanguzi added.
</P>
<P>
The New Vision daily Saturday quoted a senior security official as
saying that Odomel was forced to resign before Christmas by President
Museveni over an investigation report on him by the Inspector-General of
Government.
</P>
<P>
Odomel, 43, and his deputy John Kisembo were appointed by Museveni to
the office on April 24, 1992.
</P>
<P>
The police boss, who described his announcement as breaking news, did
not mention at the party why he was quitting, nor did he say who will
replace him.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed here that police are among the most corrupt people
in the country. Most of the senior officers of the police force are
reportedly
running businesses which are said to provide materials the police force
needs.

<HEADLINE> Feature: More Bangladeshis Show interest in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Islam was one of the Bangladeshi students attending a basic
Chinese learning course, which started here Saturday and was
sponsored by the Dhaka-based Chinese Language Center which
provides both six-month and one-year courses.
</P>
<P>
"As I have seen many Chinese movies and Chinese dramas on TV, I
become very interested in the Chinese language," said Islam, a
student of physics.
</P>
<P>
Unlike Islam, many other students wanted to learn the Chinese
language in order to do business with China, an important trade
partner of the South Asian nation.
</P>
<P>
Trade between China and Bangladesh has been developing fast
during the past few years, which stood at 750 million U.S. dollars
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
M. Rega Iftekhar Patwary, who was pursuing a degree of Master
of Business Administration in the Jahangirnagar University on the
outskirts of Dhaka, said he was thinking of doing business with
China after he finished the MBA program in February this year.
</P>
<P>
"China is a neighboring country of Bangladesh. We want to
establish a friendly relationship with China from which we may
learn a lot of things," he said.
</P>
<P>
Learning the Chinese language was not an easy job for them as
they were amazed by the picture-like Chinese characters, the
writing and pronunciation of which were not integrated as the
Bengali and the English languages.
</P>
<P>
"Learning to speak is easier than learning to write," because
"the pictorial symbols (of the Chinese language) take time to
learn," according to Patwary.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Language Center was established in July 1996 by
F.R. Siddiqui, a Chinese language expert and chemical engineer and
Mannan Khan, who received higher education in China.
</P>
<P>
"With the economic development of China and the increasing
economic cooperation between Bangladesh and China, more and more
Bangladeshis have shown interest in learning Chinese," said Khan.

However, facing a nationwide drought, overall inflation is expected to
increase gradually in the coming months on account of upward pressure on
food prices because of short supplies of cereals, especially maize in the
market, said the report.
</P>
<P>
It said that prices of maize, beef and beans have started going up and
the trend is likely to continue.
</P>
<P>
The east African country is short of up to 450,000 tons of food, due to
adverse weather conditions and destructive pests, President Mkapa said in

<HEADLINE> Seven People Killed in Nigeria's Ijaw Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Seven people were killed in Yenagoa,
capital of oil producing Bayelsa State of Nigeria, during confrontations
between Ijaw militant youths known as Egbesu and the government troops, the
Saturday Punch newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
By Friday morning, the paper said, eye witnesses claimed that seven dead
bodies had been discovered in different spots in the state capital.
</P>
<P>
Residents of Yenagoa are fleeing the city in fear of the worsening
situation while soldiers who fled their duty post at the heat of the clash
on Thursday evening returned on Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
Peace of Yenagoa was shattered Wednesday evening when protesting youths
ran into some soldiers stationed at Government House who reportedly opened
fire, killing three of them, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Angered by the killing, the youths were said to have reinforced to fight
the soldiers later in the evening and four more youths were reported to
have been killed on Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the State Military Administrator, Lieut. Col. Paul Edor Obi
declared a state of emergency in Bayelsa State and imposed a dusk-to-dawn
curfew in the state capital.
</P>
<P>
In his New Year budget broadcast, Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalam Abubakar warned that the government would not tolerate direct
confrontation and would deal decisively with a confrontational stance
adopted by the youths in Ijaw areas.
</P>
<P>
Youths from about 500 communities comprising 40 clans in Ijawland held a
meeting on December 11 in Kaiama and issued a "Kaiama Declaration" in which
they called for among other things the immediate withdrawal of security
forces employed to protect oil installations in the area and stoppage of
all oil exploration and exploitation activities.
</P>
<P>
The Ijaws are demanding the convocation of a sovereign national
conference of ethnic nationalities in the west African country to discuss a
more acceptable means of co-existence.
</P>
<P>
They also want the repeal of the current land use decrees and Petroleum
Act to revert ownership of Ijawland to Ijaws to enable them to manage their
oil resources.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Imports Portable Missile Mortars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 2 (Xinhua) - Uganda has imported about 80 tons
of portable missile mortars from Ukraine and Russia, a Tanzanian national
newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Mail said that the convoy of the military hardware has passed
through Tanzania from the northern port of Tanga to Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted reliable sources within the port administration and
military circles as saying that the cargo arrived at Tanga Port two days
before Christmas eve aboard a Greek registered vessel, mv Domain.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources who declined to be named, off-loading started
soon after the ship docked at the port and the arrangements were
immediately made under tight security to transport the goods to Kampala.
</P>
<P>
"What we know is that the goods are now on the way to Uganda by a cargo
train from Tanga-Dar es Salaam-Mwanza-Kampala," the sources added.
</P>
<P>
This is the second large consignment of military hardware since last
November when some 90 tanks imported by Uganda from Ukraine were
transported through Dar es Salaam port and Mwanza to Masaka in southern
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Ministry of Defense and National Service were not immediately
available to comment on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Land-locked Uganda imports goods mainly through Tanzania and its
military supplies are mainly escorted by the Tanzanian military forces.
</P>
<P>
Facing two separate rebellions at home in the north and west, Uganda
has been allegedly backing the rebel army in the neighboring Democratic
Republic of Congo attempting to oust President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania, claiming to be neutral in the DRC conflict, recalled its
military advisors from the DRC almost immediately after the conflict broke
out last August while other neighboring countries rushed their troops to
either side of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The war has so far already drawn in Angola, Namibia, Chad, Libya, Sudan
and Zimbabwe on Kabila's side while the Tutsi-led rebels are allegedly
backed by Rwanda and Uganda.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- France posted an emphatic win
over Zimbabwe Saturday to snare the eighth and final spot in the
Hopman Cup in Perth, a coastal city in west Australia.
</P>
<P>
The French team of Guillaume Raoux and Sandrine Testud won the
qualifying tie against the Black siblings, Cara and Wayne, to
claim its place in Group A of the mixed teams tournament.
</P>
<P>
Under the Hopman Cup format, each tie consists of a men's
singles and women's singles rubber, as well as a mixed doubles
encounter.
</P>
<P>
After Testud had won the first match of the tie in three sets,
Raoux sealed the result with a straight sets win in the men's
singles.
</P>
<P>
The Blacks gained some consolation with a straight sets win in
the doubles.
</P>
<P>
France was runner-up at last year's Hopman Cup, when
represented by Mary Pierce and Cedric Pioline.
</P>
<P>
Raoux, ranked 55th in the world, was always in control against
Black and took the first set in quick time, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
Black, ranked 97, showed renewed fight in the second set and
saved four match points before succumbing 6-3.
</P>
<P>
In the women's singles, Testud overcame a slow start to win in
three sets.
</P>
<P>
Cara Black, ranked 44 in the world, won the first set 6-4, but
Testud, ranked 14, dropped just three games from that point on,
winning the last two sets 6-1 6-2 to give France a one- nil lead.
</P>
<P>
France now plays tournament favorite Spain on Monday and
Testud said she and Raoux took great heart from last year's
performance of the Slovak Republic, who won the tournament after
qualifying.
</P>
<P>
Tomorrow sees the tournament proper begin with Australia,
looking for its first win in the Hopman Cup, up against South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
US Open runner-up Mark Philippoussis and exciting teenager
Jelena Dokic represent the home side against perennial Hopman Cup
partners Wayne Ferreira and Amanda Coetzer.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Chosen Malaria-Test Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is among four African
countries which have been selected by the World Health Organization (WHO)
to pre-test a new methodology called "Roll Back Malaria" (RBM) to combat
malaria.
</P>
<P>
James Banda, a WHO consultant based in Geneva and currently in Zambia
to advise on the RBM, said in an interview with Zambia Daily Mail that "the
pre-test results in the four countries will form the basis for finalization
of the methodology to be used by the RBM team to combat malaria the world
over."
</P>
<P>
The newspaper Saturday quoted Banda as saying that the pilot scheme
needed assessment methodology for the RBM which includes Ghana, Nigeria and
Mali, was initiated by the joint forces of the United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the World
Bank and the WHO in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
"The four organizations have joined forces to fight malaria under the
RBM program to substantially reduce the human suffering and economic losses
due to malaria," said Banda.
</P>
<P>
Petauke district has been chosen with the support of the Zambian Central
Board of Health, to be the test area in Zambia from December 21, 1998 to
January 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The RBM will seek to strengthen the health systems to ensure better
delivery of health care services especially at district and community
levels and also ensure proper and expanded use of insecticide-treated
mosquito nets.
</P>
<P>
Banda added that the RBM would also ensure adequate access to basic
health care and training of health care workers as well as encourage the
development of simpler and more effective means of administering medicines.
</P>
<P>
This will include training of village health workers, mothers and
drug peddlers on early and appropriate treatment of malaria especially for
children.
</P>
<P>
The RBM will also encourage the development of more effective and new
anti-malaria drugs and vaccines.
</P>
<P>
The pilot scheme is expected to greatly reduce malaria cases and deaths
especially in Africa by the year 2015.

<P>
LUSAKA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has spelt out measures that may
see chain stores to stop importing certain agricultural products to protect
local ones, Zambia Daily Mail newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Finance Minister Edith Nawakwi as saying that the in-
coming crops will be subjected to stringent scrutiny and surely most of
them will find it difficult to enter the country.
</P>
<P>
The minister advised major super markets to enter into agreements with
local suppliers.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot continue importing carrots and tomatoes, we shall ensure
that measures are put in place that will force these super markets to get
their produce from our own institution," she said.
</P>
<P>
The Zambia National Farmers Union recently called on the government to
impose eye-for-eye non-tariff barriers on all horticultural produce from
neighboring South Africa and Zimbabwe , enabling Zambian farmers to compete
fairly.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Khmer Rouge leaders Khieu
Samphan and Nuon Chea, who recently defected to the Cambodian
government, left here Saturday for Siem Reap to visit Angkor Wat,
which was the last stop of their Phnom Penh trip.
</P>
<P>
The pair surrendered to the royal government on December 25
after they got the assurance that they would not be prosecuted.
During their stay in Phnom Penh, they received a warm welcome
from Prime Minister Hun Sen and National Assembly President Prince
Ranariddh.
</P>
<P>
Before they left for Angkor Wat, they also spent two days
sightseeing in the southwest seashore city of Sihanoukville.
</P>
<P>
Khieu Samphan was last seen by the public in 1992 while Nuon
Chea had not appeared since 1979, after the Khmer Rouge went into
a guerrilla war against the government near the Cambodian-Thai
boarder.
</P>
<P>
International and domestic pressures are mounting these days on
the government and Hun Sen to try the two Khmer Rouge leaders. Hun
Sen and King Sihanouk are urged not to pardon the Khmer Rouge
leaders.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen responded Friday evening that he is not opposed to the
trial of the Khmer Rouge leaders and the crimes they committed.
"It is a matter of time," he said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that his position to try the Khmer Rouge has not
changed and will not change.
</P>
<P>
"I did not mention the trial of the Khmer Rouge leaders in my
recent talks not because I have forgotten it, but because I
believed the first thing we should talk about is peace, which is
what the country and the Cambodian people need most," Hun Sen
explained.

ISLAMABAD, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's power sector
attracted a total of 314 million U.S. dollars in foreign direct
investment (FDI) in the past 16 months, which accounts for 45
percent of the overall inflow of FDI in the country during the

Sources from the Board of Investment believe that in the next

increase after an understanding was reached between the government
and some remaining independent power producers on the power tariff
issue.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has put pressure on the Pakistani government to
normalize its relations with private power producers, where the
bank has invested more than 3 billion dollars through its

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Trade Deficit Narrows Last November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's trade deficit narrowed
to 32 million U.S. Dollars last November from 53.8 million Dollars in
the previous month, according to Tanzania's central bank.
</P>
<P>
The improvement in the trade account can be attributed to an
increase of 21 percent in exports, from 71.9 million Dollars in October to
87 million Dollars in November, the central bank said in its latest monthly
economic review.
</P>
<P>
The report said there were increases in both volume and unit
prices for traditional export crops, mainly agricultural produce.
</P>
<P>
"Except for cotton whose volume declined by 16.5 percent and
sisal whose unit price decreased by 29.3 percent, all other
traditional exports, namely coffee, tea, tobacco and cashew nut
recorded significant increases in export volumes and unit prices,"
it said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the central bank said that imports during November
decreased by 5.3 percent to 119 million Dollars from 125 million recorded
in October.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Marks 40th Anniversary of Revolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Cuba on Friday staged a rally in
Santiago to mark the 40th anniversary of the triumph of the Cuban
revolution.
</P>
<P>
Cuban President Fidel Castro, who led the revolution to
victory, returned to the square in Santiago, the second largest
city of the country, where he first appeared as Cuba's leader on
January 1, 1959.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion, Castro said Cuba has made great
progress over the past 40 years. In 1959, only 30 percent of the
population were literate and there were merely four universities
and several dozens of technical schools, but now there are
250,000 teachers who graduated from universities, 64,000 doctors
and 60,000 college graduates in Cuba, the Cuban leader added.
</P>
<P>
Castro praised the Cuban people for their efforts in
overcoming the economic difficulties which have been troubling
the Caribbean island country over the years.
</P>
<P>
He said that for the young Cubans the revolution just began
and they have to carry it on.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban president also criticized the new liberalist
globalization and gave his views over the crisis in the world
economic order and its grave social consequences.
</P>
<P>
A crowd of about 2,000 supporters gathered in the square and
listened to Castro's 90-minute speech with chants of ``Fidel,
Fidel.''
</P>
<P>
At night on January 1, 1959, Castro entered the eastern Cuban
city of Santiago, forcing Dictator Fulgencio Batista to flee Cuba
next morning and throwing down the corrupt Batista regime.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Tries to Boost Income of Coco Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Coconut
Administration (PCA) is embarking on a long-term coconut industry
development plan aimed at leading to a 10-fold increase in the
income of coco farmers.
</P>
<P>
In a report published here Saturday, PCA Administrator Eduardo
Escueta said the plan calls for the clustering of small coconut
farm holdings into 15-hectare farm modules called model farms.
</P>
<P>
The business activities in these model farms, according to
Escueta, are expected to raise the income of coco farmers from
10,000 pesos (250 U.S. dollars) per hectare to 100,000 pesos
(2,500 dollars) per hectare yearly.
</P>
<P>
With coconut as the main crop, the model farm concept involves
intensive inter-cropping of short-term cash crops and perennial
tree crops, livestock, poultry raising and aquaculture, he said.
</P>
<P>
Escueta said there are presently 3 million hectares of coconut
land in the Philippines but only about 900,000 hectares are
inter-cropped.
</P>
<P>
Through the model farm program, which the PCA will establish in
selected areas of the country, the PCA hopes to transform small
farm holdings into productive entrepreneurial communities, Escueta
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that while the Philippines still accounts for 73
percent of the total world exports of coconut oil, production is
decreasing because of senility of coconut palms, inadequate seed
gardens for replanting purposes and unabated cutting down of
coconut palms.
</P>
<P>
To remedy the situation, Escueta said, the government is
committed to providing the industry with a minimum annual budget
of 450 million pesos (11 million dollars) after 1999 to continue
the replanting of 50,000 hectares per year.

The fire started from 1:00 p.m. local time at the sprawling Bombolulu

Two people fainted when they found their houses destroyed on returning

<HEADLINE> China's Exports in 1998 Valued at 180 Billion US Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Total exports of China in 1998
were valued at 180 billion U.S. dollars, Zhang Xiang,
Vice-Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC),
has predicted.
</P>
<P>
Speaking recently at a forum marking the 50th anniversary of
the Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation under
the MOFTEC, Zhang said exports in 1998 remained almost at the same
level of 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, a final report will be released by China's General
Administration of Customs this month.
</P>
<P>
Zhang also estimated that China's imports in 1998 stood at 135
billion dollars, which means the overall trade volume balanced with
the 1997 figure.
</P>
<P>
Early last year, China planned to achieve a ten percent
increase in foreign trade, but the Asian financial
crisis and severe summer floods in the nation broke its plan.
</P>
<P>
According to Custom statistics, China's trade volume
had accumulated to 286.5 billion U.S. dollars in the first 11
months of 1998, down 0.2 percent from the same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In the same period, export volume grew 0.2 percent to reach
163.9 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said it was not easy to accomplish this volume,
considering all negative influences in 1998, which featured the
undevaluation of the Chinese currency and economic landslides in
its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Investment contracts from Japan, the Republic of Korea, some
southeast Asian nations, as well as from Hong Kong, Macao and
Taiwan to the motherland dropped 12 percent by the end of
September, while actual used capital going down 10.3 percent.

<P>
HANOI, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's Prime Minister Phan Van
Khai has urged rural localities nationwide to prepare for
prolonged drought that looms over 1999, casting long shadows over
the next winter-spring and summer-autumn crops.
</P>
<P>
In instructions issued early last week for initiating
anti-drought preparations, Khai said 1998 was a "dry " year and it
could get drier and unpredictable in 1999, hurting agricultural
production, the newspaper Vietnam News reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the rainy season ended about a month earlier than
usual and the total average rainfall dropped by a record 20- to
25-percent against the recent past, according to the General
Department of Meteorology and Hydrology.
</P>
<P>
Water levels have fallen by 20 to 40 percent and flash floods
recorded their lowest incidence since 1926, particularly in the
Mekong River delta.
</P>
<P>
There is already a severe shortage of water supply for staple,
industrial and cash crops in many areas of Vietnam which has and
will continue to adversely affect the life and production of
farmers, the prime minister said.

<P>
MANILA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The anti-government National
Democratic Front (NDF) is building up its forces by recruiting
more fighters after suffering a series of debacles during the past
eight years.
</P>
<P>
In a report released here Saturday, the Armed Forces of the
Philippines (AFP) said the group headed by its exiled leader Jose
Ma. Sison enlisted 624 new recruits last year, increasing their
fighting force from 5,406 in 1997 to 6,030 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The AFP said the group has an estimated 5,187 assorted firearms
as of December 31, 1998, slightly up by 346 firearms from the 1997
figure of 4,841.
</P>
<P>
Since their disastrous defeat in the past years after the AFP
launched its counter-insurgency program, the NDF has been trying
to regain its foothold in the countryside, it said.
</P>
<P>
The AFP said anti-government activities by the NDF have
increased slightly from 174 in 1997 to 186 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The on-going peace talks between the government and the NDF
have somewhat minimized the number of killed and wounded, the AFP
said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, it said, only 109 NDF guerrillas were killed while
government forces suffered 70 deaths, including 20 policemen.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Old Friends Move Closer by Fresh Visits (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan kicked off his five-African-nation tour this morning,
marking a fresh start for enhancing relations with old friends
in the continent.
</P>
<P>
The visit, China's first diplomatic activity in the new year,
demonstrates the great importance the country places on the
Sino-African relations.
</P>
<P>
The five countries -- Egypt, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania and
Zambia -- enjoy long-standing and stable cooperative relations
with China.
</P>
<P>
Sources say that duing the visit Tang will confer with the
leaders of the five nations on furthering the growth of bilateral
relations, the regional situation and other issues of mutual
concern.
</P>
<P>
Liu Guijin, director of the African Affairs Department in the
Chinese Foreign Ministry, told Xinhua that China will not neglect
its ties with Africa while it improves its relations with
powers.
</P>
<P>
Liu, who is accompanying Tang on the visit, said he believes
this tour will instill new impetus into the continuing and smooth
growth of Sino-African relations, especially the cooperation in a
variety of areas between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Tang, who took office last March, is following the tradition of
his predecessor by choosing Africa as the destination of the first
visit in a year.
</P>
<P>
Africa was the first place visited by Vice-Premier Qian Qichen
at the beginning of a year during his ten-year term as China's
foreign minister.

<P>
Moreover, Tang began his first official visit to five nations
in west Africa last June, and his ongoing Africa tour, across the
rest of the continent, demonstrates China's willingness to enhance
traditional Sino-African friendship by pursuing consistent
policies toward Africa.
</P>
<P>
Sino-African relations have gone well in recent years. Chinese
President Jiang Zemin put forward a five-point proposal for
advancing long-standing, stable, cooperative and comprehensive
relations geared to the 21st century during his 1996 six-African
nation tour, which gained wide popularity in the continent.
</P>
<P>
After Jiang's Africa tour, then Chinese Premier Li Peng also
paid a visit to seven African nations in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The two visits fully show that China values traditional
Sino-African friendship, and is prepared to enhance its political
and economic relations.
</P>
<P>
Since then, South Africa, Niger, the Central African Republic
and Guinea-Bissau established or restored diplomatic relations
with China.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Customs statistics show that bilateral trade volume in
the January-November period last year stood at approximately 5
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
There exists enormous untapped potential for cooperation in
technology, equipment and natural resources exploitation made
possible by highly complementary economies of the two sides.
</P>
<P>
As world multipolarization moves forward, the further
growth of Sino-African friendship and cooperation will not only
help safeguard the rights and interests of the developing
countries, but also establish a new international order,
local analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to regulate Foreign Trade in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's Prime Minister Phan Van
Khai has asked relevant ministries to regulate next year's imports
and exports based on the balance of payments, Vietnam News Agency
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Under a decision which was issued by the prime minister on
December 30 and will be in effect from January 1, 1999, to March
31, 2000, a number of commodities will be subject to import
regulation.
</P>
<P>
They include electric fans, ceramic and granite tiles, consumer
goods made of porcelain, glass and pottery, packages made of
finished plastics, steel tubes of 20-114 mm, cast-iron tubes,
bicycles, refined vegetable oil, trucks of fewer than five tons,
passenger buses of 15 to 50 seats, cargo and passenger
automobiles, second-hand ambulances.
</P>
<P>
The import of consumer goods and some materials, including
steel ingots, PVC, aluminum bars and components will be regulated
by taxes and additional charges.
</P>
<P>
Importers of consumer goods have to balance their foreign
currency sources and make prompt payments in cash, according to
the decision.
</P>
<P>
The Trade Ministry will be responsible for conducting
negotiations for a reasonable balance of two-way trade turnover
with those countries which want to export a large volume of goods
to Vietnam at the latter's preferential tariffs, the decision
said.
</P>
<P>
The government will ensure foreign currency for importing
petroleum, fertilizer and iron and steel, which will be allowed
for re-export only when foreign customers can make repayment in
convertible foreign currencies.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister will make a final decision if the countries
sharing borders with Vietnam officially ask to buy the said
materials but are unable to pay in convertible foreign currencies.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Improve Fire Service in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
promised Saturday to make its effort to fully improve the fire
service nationwide.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview Saturday, Undersecretary Ronaldo Puno of
the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) said the
planned devolution would pass on the maintenance and operation
expenses from the national to the local government.
</P>
<P>
"This won't be like the devolution in 1992 when the DILG
devolved only personnel but not the finances," Puno said.
</P>
<P>
Puno also said his office is now studying the capacity of local
governments to shoulder the cost of fire-prevention and
fire-response programs.
</P>
<P>
He said that while local governments have more than enough
resources for the purpose, most lack the financial capability to
do so.
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps in about 60 percent of our country, they really do not
have the financial capacity to absorb the services," he said.
</P>
<P>
The inadequacy of the fire service's ability to respond
properly to fires surfaced anew on December 3, 1998, when a
pre-dawn fire burned down an orphanage in Paco, Manila, killing at
least 30 persons.

SEOUL, January 2 (Xinhua) -- South Korea registered a trade
surplus of 39.9 billion U.S. dollars in 1998, said the Commerce,
Industry and Energy Ministry Saturday.
</P>
<P>
South Korean export reached 133.22 billion dollars, down 2.2
percent from 1997 while import plunged 35.4 billion dollars to
93.34 billion dollars, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The trade surplus almost hit the target of 40 billion dollars
set by the South Korean government earlier last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South Korea's per capita gross national product
(GNP) is expected to plunge by 33.5 percent to 6,321 dollars in
1998 following the financial crisis, which was caused primarily
by corporate bankruptcies and bad loans of financial institutions
in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, economists said the worst time of the financial
crisis has gone though South Korea's per capita is due to rank
42nd in the world in 1998, down from 34th in 1997.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's economy will emerge from slump in the first
quarter of 1999 on improved domestic sales, export and corporate
profitability, said the Bank of Korea.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Intensify Crackdown on Drug Dealers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine National Police
(PNP) will shift its operations to the fight against drug
trafficking this year following the neutralization of 15
kidnap-for-ransom syndicates in the past six months.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine News Agency Saturday quoted a PNP spokesman as
saying the police have neutralized 15 kidnap gangs since July last
year.
</P>
<P>
Among the big-time kidnap-for-ransom groups rendered
ineffective were the Sarabia group, Baleleng group and the "P50
Million" kidnap gang, he said.
</P>
<P>
The 15 kidnap-for-ransom gangs were responsible for a series of
kidnapping incidents in Metro Manila in the past years until they
were neutralized by the police.
</P>
<P>
With the neutralization of kidnapping cases, the spokesman
said, the PNP will concentrate its job in stamping out other
crimes, particularly drug trafficking, the country's number-one
problem at present.
</P>
<P>
He said that usually kidnap gangs shift their operations to
other illegal activities as their strategy of what they call "a
cool-off period" when the police are pursuing kidnap-for-ransom
syndicates relentlessly.

OTTAWA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Nine people were killed and 25
injured by an avalanche in northern Quebec of Canada early
Friday, reports said, raising the previous toll of eight.
</P>
<P>
The tragedy struck at about midnight Friday as some 400 to 500
people were packed into the school gym of an Inuit village
celebrating the New Year.
</P>
<P>
Six people died soon after the avalanche crashed into the gym,
while three other victims were discovered several hours later,
buried deep under mounds of snow, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Twelve of the injured were flown by jet-air ambulance to
Montreal hospitals. Others were treated at the village of
Kangiqsualujjuaq, which is about 1,500 kilometers northeast of
Montreal.

"Obviously, there was a big storm, which caused the avalanc

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Philippines Deepens Banking Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- With the financial sector being a
liability in its effort to revive the economy, the Philippines
introduced a package of banking reform measures at the end of last
year to gain the upper hand in facing the challenges in 1999.
</P>
<P>
As the government projected the country's gross domestic
product to grow by 2.1 percent to 3.1 percent this year, the
Manila-based Asia Development Bank warned that the economy would
be hard-pressed to reach the target.
</P>
<P>
In its annual Country Economic Review, the bank said a critical
factor affecting the economy's ability to recover quickly will be
the pace at which the health of the banking sector can be
restored.
</P>
<P>
The bank noted that the ratio of bad loans to total
outstanding loans in the country's banking system rose to 10.5
percent last August from a pre-crisis level of 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Wall Street Journal quoted some economists as
predicting that the ratio would jump to 15 percent in the coming
months.
</P>
<P>
Problems in the country's banking system could pose a threat
to the country's effort for economic recovery, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
As part of the government's drive to weed out weak banks and
improve transparency, the Central Bank of the Philippines last
month deepened reform on the country's 53 big banks, 20 of which
are universal banks and 33 commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
The central bank required the banks to raise their
capitalization by a December 24 deadline, prescribing a
2-billion-peso (50-million-U.S. dollar) capital level for
commercial banks and a 4.5-billion-peso (113-million-dollar) level
for universal banks.
</P>
<P>
As a result, 49 of the banks got the nod with enough funds to
guard against likely future financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The four banks that failed to shore up their capital were
required to execute a memorandum of understanding with the central
bank on a capital restoration plan.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the banks must upgrade their capital position
within 30 days, or face sanctions, which include prohibition of
payment of cash dividends, stripping of branching privilege and
denial of access to the central bank's rediscounting facilities.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said it would strictly monitor the operation
of the four banks through special examinations and frequent
meetings with their board of directors.
</P>
<P>
These measures are aimed at improving transparency concerning
the capital of the banks and the operation of the weak banks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Monetary Board, the policy-making body of the
central bank, has approved in principle the application of
Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp. for a license to operate as a
universal bank in the country.
</P>
<P>
Given the emerging capital markets worldwide and Hongkong
Bank's overseas network and technological expertise, Hongkong Bank
could be instrumental in exposing the Philippine capital market to
international investors.
</P>
<P>
Hongkong Bank has been operating in the Philippines since 1875
and is one of the largest banking and financial services
organizations in the world.
</P>
<P>
It would be the second foreign bank to operate as a universal
bank in the country, with ING Bank being the first to get a
universal bank license.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the central bank is making great effort to seek
international aid to directly fund the banking reform.
</P>
<P>
For example, a World Bank loan, which is still under
negotiation, is designed to finance reforms in the banking sector
especially in the area of bank supervision and examination,
government officials said.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund, on the other hand, will
provide balance-of-payments support to ensure the country's
credit worthiness and as protection against currency speculators,
they added.
</P>
<P>
As pointed out by the government officials, although the ratio
of bad loans to total outstanding loans in the country's banking
system is manageable compared with that of other countries of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the financial system needs
to be strengthened in the country's effort to achieve economic
recovery.
</P>
<P>
In addition, around 40 banks in the country closed down during
the past year.
</P>
<P>
The banks in the Philippines ushered in the new year by
embracing reform, which they hope will enable them to take up the
challenges in the new year.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Security: Uganda Rises to the Challenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's road of development
in 1998 proved extraordinarily arduous and bumpy with security
looming as a growing problem.
</P>
<P>
With liberalization of the economy in the east African
country, terrorism, though still a new phenomenon in Uganda, has
become increasingly rampant as the Ugandans were haunted by the
hair-raising acts of terrorism throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
In early April, two terrorist bombings in downtown Kampala
killed four innocent diners and evoked a tense atmosphere among
panic-gripped residents.
</P>
<P>
On May 18, Uganda's biggest city robbery in the year occurred
when a gang of five armed thugs broke into the Cairo
International Bank in broad daylight and got away with 240,000
U.S. Dollars. Two other bank robberies that followed forced
bankers to beef up security.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 rebels of the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) launched
a pre-dawn surprise attack on Kichwamba National Technical
Institute in western Uganda in early June, burning more than 80
sleeping students to death and abducting more than 100 others.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that more than 360 children have been abducted
by ADF rebels since 1996 and much more by rebels of Lord's
Resistance Army (LRA) in the North.
</P>
<P>
These two rebel groups, using bases on foreign land, sneak
into Uganda from time to time and kill and maim local residents,
making life in northern and western border districts a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
The capital city, Kampala, was also targeted by terrorists in
early August when devastating bombings in Nairobi and
Dar-es-Salaam shocked the world. The schemes were, fortunately,
not implemented because they were found in time.
</P>
<P>
The three explosions on buses bound for up-country, which
killed 30 passengers on August 25, plus the reports of LRA rebels
ambushing buses on feeder roads in distant districts made
highways roads of danger for many.
</P>
<P>
Terrorists also target foreigners. A dozen people including
Chinese, South Koreans and Americans have been killed in Kampala
alone in the past year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, several foreign embassies and U.N. agencies here
received threats and had to closed temporarily for safety's sake.
</P>
<P>
The growing insecurity has incurred heavy losses to local
people and it has become a huge stumbling stone hampering the
country's social and economic development.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Security: Uganda Rises to the Challenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tourism and foreign investment are sectors first and worst hit
by deteriorating security.
</P>
<P>
Tourist arrivals plummeted to about 50,000 this year from the
150,000 in 1997, due to security concerns.
</P>
<P>
The tourist regions of Kasese, Kabarole and Bundibugyo
districts in the west and some districts in the north experienced
disruptions due to insecurity.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more and more foreign investors, who used to choose
Uganda as an investment destination, tend to revise their
decisions. In 1997, foreign investment in the country topped 1.5
billion U.S. Dollars while only one fifth of that amount was
registered in the first 11 months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Lack of foreign exchange caused by the shrinking tourism and
capital withdrawal by foreign investors has made local currency
extremely weak, with Ugandan shilling depreciated by more than 20
percent against U.S. Dollar from August to December in 1998. And
the Shilling is still falling as the state coffers does not have
enough hard currency to inject into the market to rescue the
falling Shilling.
</P>
<P>
The frequent cases of terrorism have also tarnished the image
of the government, as people's confidence in the government is
weakened and donors, whose money the country depends so heavily
on, find the government losing control of the situation.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has been deemed a success story both economically and
politically in Africa. But all this economic revival and relative
stability, achieved after long-time efforts by the ruling
National Resistance Movement government, can be stifled in the
cradles by unchecked terrorism.
</P>
<P>
To safeguard all these hard-earned achievements, Uganda is now
doubling its efforts to fight against terrorism and other crimes.
</P>
<P>
In the new budget, the military spending increased by 26
percent to improve the army's capability through modernization.
The Defense Ministry has imported new military hardware to equip
the army.
</P>
<P>
State Minister of Defense Steven Kavuma said last month Uganda
is building a modernized, highly disciplined army to defend its
borders against any incursions by rebels as well as aggressors.
</P>
<P>
Police are also reinforced. A total of 1,000 new recruits were
made recently and more people will be added to the police force.
</P>
<P>
Following the surge of terrorism, more policemen were sent on
patrol in streets and more security operations were conducted.
Meanwhile, police training has resumed after several years of
neglect.
</P>
<P>
Local media have also been mobilized to boost the security
awareness among average Ugandans.
</P>
<P>
However, burdened with a heavy foreign debt of 3.6 billion
U.S. Dollars, the Ugandan government can not expect to
eliminate poverty overnight, which is regarded as a key source
of crime and terrorism. Security, therefore, is and may
continue to be a big challenge for the government.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Hold City Polls in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Elections in Bangladesh's four
city corporations and 147 municipalities will be held in the last
week of February, The Daily Star newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission would announce the poll schedules
before the Eid-ul-Fitr, likely to be observed on January 20 after
the Ramadan, the month of fasting.
</P>
<P>
"We are planning to hold the mayoral polls as well as the
municipal elections in the last week of February," Chief Election
Commissioner Mohammad Abu Hena was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The three-member Election Commission, a constitutional body in
charge of the country's elections, would hold a meeting on Sunday
to finalize the election schedules.
</P>
<P>
Elections in the 147 municipalities would be staged over three
days and the mayoral polls would be held on a single day, the
newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The mayoral polls had been scheduled to take place by April 3
this year. The municipal polls were due in February last year but
could not be held because of a writ petition against a certain
amendment to the electoral law.
</P>
<P>
Under the amended provision, the government would enjoy the
right to appoint a bureaucrat to run the municipalities for the
period between the expiry of the tenure of an elected body and the
takeover by another elected body.
</P>
<P>
The Association of the Municipal Chairmen called the provision
unconstitutional and submitted a writ petition to the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
The last municipal polls in Bangladesh were held on January 30,
1993.

<HEADLINE> Total Births Dip in Singapore in Tiger Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Fewer babies were born in
Singapore in 1998, the Year of the Tiger which many Chinese here
consider an inauspicious year, the local English newspaper The
Straits Times reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The paper said 26,534 babies were born to Chinese fathers in
the first 11 months of 1998, nearly 2,800 fewer than the previous
year's 29,323.
</P>
<P>
The dip is not mirrored in the other ethnic groups in
Singapore, the paper noted.
</P>
<P>
The paper said there was a similar fall in the number of babies
born in the last Tiger Year in 1986 which saw about 4,000 fewer
born than in the preceding year, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by Singapore Immigration and Registration
show 40,388 babies were born in Singapore in the first 11 months
of 1998, about 2,500 fewer than the 42,963 born in the same period
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The paper attributed the drop in the birth rate to the belief by
many Chinese here that Tiger babies, especially girls, will grow
up with fierce temperaments.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that many appear to have avoided starting
their family in the Year of Tiger, preferring perhaps to wait for
the Year of the Rabbit.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the traditional beliefs, the paper quoted a young
mother of two children as saying, "But really, a lot of it is just
traditional beliefs. There is little proof that it is true."
</P>
<P>
The woman, 29 in age, has a boy born in September 1998, who
is nowhere as "fierce' and active as his sister who was born three
years ago in the Year of the Rat.
</P>
<P>
Overall, however, the birth rate in Singapore has been
declining over the past decades. Live births hit a high of 62,495
in 1958 and had been sliding steadily since then to 47,333 in
1997, the paper added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Mergers, Acquisitions Hit Record in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 1 (Xinhua) -- With more than 7,700
transactions and announced values totaling 1.2 trillion U.S.
dollars, the merger and acquisition (M&AMP;A) market in the United
States broke its previous records in 1998, a report said Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to Mergerstat, a division of Los Angeles investment
bank Houlihan Lockey Howard &AMP; Zukin, the previous all-time record
was set in 1997, with 650.7 billion dollars in value. Although
the number of deals was basically even with 1997, the average
transaction size of last year was 393.7 million dollars, up 88
percent.
</P>
<P>
The increase in average deal size was fueled by increases in
both the number and size of mega-deals valued at one billion
dollars and above, said Mergerstat, which tracks deals involving
U.S. companies. Mega-mergers accounted for almost 920 billion
dollars and 77 percent of the total M&AMP;A deal market.
</P>
<P>
For the second consecutive year, financial services industry
led the market, with deals involving banks, brokerages,
investment firms and insurance companies accounting for 25.4
percent of all announced deals. Four of the top deals were in the
financial services sector, including the NationsBank acquisition
of BankAmerica and Travelers Group's acquisition of Citicorp.
</P>
<P>
The highly active telecommunications industry helped drive
communications to the number two industry ranking, with deals
accounting for 170 billion dollars and 14.3 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Oil and gas was third with 12.9 percent of the 1998 deal
market and transactions valued at 154.6 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The last two of the top five industries were utilities and
broadcasting, each with about a five-percent share of the overall
deal value.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Govt. to Invest in New Power Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government will
invest over 1.6 billion rupees (23.5 million U.S. dollars) in new
power projects this year to meet the demand from households and
the industrial sector, government officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 100 million rupees (1.47 million dollars) will be
spent this year on setting up new transformers and expanding
electricity supply, said Ananda Dharmapriya, senior assistant
secretary with the Ministry of Irrigation, Power and Energy.
</P>
<P>
He said Sri Lanka has decided to observe 1999-2009 as a decade
of power development.
</P>
<P>
The 10-year power development program, estimated to cost 200
billion rupees (2.94 billion dollars), is designed to provide
every household with electricity and increase the national power
grid in order to cater to upcoming industries.
</P>
<P>
Several coal-fired or hydro power projects are expected to be
launched during the 10-year period, said the secretary.
</P>
<P>
Only 52 percent of Sri Lankan households have access to
electricity at present. The power shortage has severely restricted
the scope of people's life and industrial development.

<P>
"In the incident, three Myanmar personnel were hit and
wounded," it said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Attracts 1.9 Bln Dollars of Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam attracted a total of 1.9
billion U.S. dollars of foreign investment in 1998, the Vietnam
News Saturday quoted a government official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Deputy minister of planning and investment Nguyen Nhac said it
was "a remarkable result in view of the negative impacts of the
regional financial and monetary crisis on the country."
</P>
<P>
However, he did not say how many foreign investment funds had
been disbursed.
</P>
<P>
Some 70 percent of foreign investment capital into Vietnam had
come from Asian counties which have been affected by the ongoing
regional financial crisis. The countries also accounted for 70
percent of Vietnam's exports.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the number of projects and the amount of foreign
investment into Vietnam in 1998 dropped by 21.5 percent and 10.1
percent over 1997 respectively, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Foreign invested projects accounted for about 23.5 percent of
the national industrial value last year compared with 20.6 percent
in 1997 and 21.4 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 270,000 Vietnamese people were working in foreign
invested projects that contributed 320 million U.S. dollars to the
state budget, an increase of 1.6 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
To improve the environment for foreign investors, the
Vietnamese government has lowered land rent for 269 projects in
four industrial zones in Hanoi, Haiphong and Ho Chi Minh city.

<HEADLINE> Video Film Production Becomes More Brisk in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The output of video films was
much greater than that of motion pictures in Myanmar in 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, only 15 new Myanmar motion
pictures were produced, while there were 547 video films.
</P>
<P>
There are 7,202 entrepreneurs who are engaged in the business
of video halls, while there are only 160 cinemas in the country.
</P>
<P>
The production of video films grows rapidly because of high
demand for videos.
</P>
<P>
In order to properly control and manage the video industry, the
Myanmar Ministry of Information revised in December some video
rules under the existing 1996 Television and Video Law, revoking
some television and video procedures.
</P>
<P>
The Video Censor Board was formed to check the films and videos
in accordance with the policies, rules and standards to make sure
they are found suitable to be shown to the public.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto's Family Owns 4.3 Million Hectares of Forest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian former president
Soeharto's family controls at least 4.3 million hectares of forest
concessions in the country, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
The 4.3 million hectares of forest were owned by the Soeharto
family through their stakes in 65 timber companies, local leading
newspapers Saturday quoted Minister of Forestry and Plantations
Muslimin Nasution as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The ownership of those timber companies is in the names of
Soeharto's children, grand-children, brother and his sons-in-low
and daughter-in-low. There is no stake in either Soeharto's name
or Ibu Thien's (Soeharto's late wife) name," the minister told the
ministry's year-end media briefing on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said the estimate of the size of the forest areas controlled
by the Soeharto family was based on the percentage of their shares
in the 65 timber companies.
</P>
<P>
The family has stakes of between 10 percent and 100 percent in
the 65 companies.
</P>
<P>
Director General of Forest utilization Waskito Soerjodibroto
said earlier the ministry's investigator had discovered that 9.4
million hectares of the country's forests and plantations were
owned or controlled by former president Soeharto, his family and
close associates.
</P>
<P>
"The remaining 5.1 million hectares were controlled by
Soeharto's cronies through shares held in various companies,"
Muslimin said.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry found a strong indication that those
properties were acquired by the Soeharto family and their cronies
through corruptive, collusive and nepotistic (KKN) practices.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Minister Admits Gov't Puts Sports on Back Burner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian State Minister of
Youth Affairs and Sports Agung Laksono conceded the government's
attention to national sports is lacking and much needs to be done
to polish the professionalism of coaches and athletes.
</P>
<P>
During an evaluation of the past year in national sports,
Agung said politics and the economic crisis were the government's
priorities.
</P>
<P>
"You know that in the decrees of the People's Consultative
Assembly, sports were not involved even in the reform era. We
don't even have the sports law although it was discussed several
years ago," Agung was quoted by the Jakarta Post as saying on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Agung expressed hope new members of the House of
Representatives from the general election in June could use their
initiative rights for the sports law.
</P>
<P>
"Even if we don't have it now, we shouldn't be pessimistic
and desperate," he added.
</P>
<P>
Agung said the next government must pay more attention to
sports. He also hoped for an end to all political and economic t
urmoil to enable the sports community to focus on their
international challenges.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has launched the Golden Garuda project to groom
young athletes for the Asiad, with an aim to finish at least
sixth in the quadrennial event.
</P>
<P>
In the 13th Asian Games in Bangkok in December, Indonesia
finished 11th with six golds, 10 silvers and 11 bronzes.
</P>
<P>
It was double the number of Indonesian golds won at the Asiad
in Hiroshima, Japan. All those medals were earned in badminton.
</P>
<P>
"If we look at the golds, our achievement has improved 100
percent, but if the basis is on our ranking, we are still far
behind other Asian countries and regions, including Thailand,"
Agung said.
</P>
<P>
"If the chaotic situation continues, I guess it will be a
threat to the Golden Garuda project," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged each sports organization to identify its
strengths for major events.
</P>
<P>
"In track and field, we've proved that our best is in the
middle distance running events. We must urge athletes not only
to win the gold, but also to set a new record, either Asian or
world", he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the National Sports Council's goal prioritization
could extend to sending younger or second-string athletes to
events such as the Southeast Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, we always want to win, but we must understand
which event we should compete in. If our Asiad gold medalists
have to compete in the Southeast Asian Games, it wouldn't make
sense anymore," he said.
</P>
<P>
Agung said the council should also strive to enhance the skil
ls of coaches to draw out top performances from their charges.
</P>
<P>
He urged the council's provincial branches to more actively
hone athletes for national training camps.
</P>
<P>
Agung said the council should build an international-standard
sports complex outside the capital but close to a university
campus if it was sincere about hosting the Asiad. He cited the
University of Indonesia campus as a possibility.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, it seems more likely that neighbouring
Malaysia, host of the Commonwealth Games, and India will bid for
the Asiad.
</P>
<P>
"The problem in building such a complex is funds. It's
impossible to use the Senayan complex as it's really crowded," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"If we can't provide such facilities, we must wait for
another four years to host an Asiad," he added.

<HEADLINE> Italy to Further Participate in EU Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini said here Friday that Italy should further participate in
the political and economic integration process undertaken by the
European Union (EU) following the launch of the new European si
ngle currency -- the euro.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Italian news agency ANSA on Friday,
Dini said the fact that Italy was one of the first euro countries
showed that it was capable of working miracles.
</P>
<P>
However, he said it was wrong to be content with the
achievements already scored, though euro would promote EU's
stability, enhance its competitiveness, and "at the same time
enable our allies to cherish greater aspirations".
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, "we should restructure our domestic
institutions so as to more actively participate in the European
political and economic integration drive. "
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that after the launch of the euro,
"we should not forget aspiration of the other half of Europe, but
strive to remove the old separation wall created by the Cold War.
This is a task that we must fulfill within this century."

<HEADLINE> Thai Scientists Plan to Clone Elephants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 2 (Xinhua) ---- Thai scientists have initiated
a project to clone elephants whose number is dwindling in
Thailand, the Bangkok Post reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The project, initiated by scientists at Mahidol University's
Institute of Science and Technology for Research and Development,
would be a long-term one to be carried out over the next 10 years,
veterinarian Chisanu Chiyacharoensri was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Elephant is Thailand's national symbol. However, there has been
a decline in the number of Thai elephants. As a result, there are
now very few elephants with good physical characteristics left in
the country, especially hulks with beautiful long tusks.
</P>
<P>
After learning of foreign scientists' attempt to clone the
extinct mammoth, their Thai counterparts who believed it would be
possible to clone Thai elephants launched a basic research program
starting with a study of life cycle of five female elephants that
would take about four years to complete.
</P>
<P>
Thai scientists at Mahidol University had already achieved
partial success in their project to clone a cow, which was
pregnant at the moment. This would be a good foundation for the
elephant-cloning project, the vet said.

OTTAWA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- At least eight people, including
five young children, were killed and 25 injured Friday when an
avalanche hit a Quebec village during a New Year celebration,
police said.
</P>
<P>
Some 400 to 500 people were attending the festivities just

Kangiqsualujjuaq, some 1,500 kilometers north of Montreal, when
heaps of snow shattered one of the walls.

<P>
Police said the victims included five children younger than
eight and the injured included nine children. At least one boy
was still missing as the search was going on.
</P>
<P>
The injured were being taken to hospitals by planes since the
town, where some 650 residents live, has no doctors but only two
nurses.
</P>
<P>
Police said the gym was buried by snow between one and four
meters, with the roof threatening to cave in, while another
avalanche was possible.

<HEADLINE> UN Official Predicts War Over Water Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 1 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations
environmental official predicted a possible war over water as a
result of an increasing conflict between population and water
resources.
</P>
<P>
Klaus Toepfer, Director-General of the United Nations Environ
ment Program, said in an interview that appeared in the Friday
issue of Environmental Science and Technology that he was
convinced there would be a conflict over natural resources,
particularly water.
</P>
<P>
He said: "Everybody knows that we have an increase in
population, but we do not have a corresponding increase in
drinking water, so the result in the regional dimension is
conflict."
</P>
<P>
He called for efforts to monitor worldwide reserves of
drinking water and establish cooperative agreements for the use
of water, including groundwater. He also urged economic
instruments to stimulate the use of new technologies to promote
water conservation.
</P>
<P>
Predicting a dramatic global population growth in the future,
Toepfer called for an "efficiency revolution." He said any
solution for addressing the growth must be linked with "new
technologies that concentrate more on efficient use of limited
natural resources."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said these technologies must be available on
preferential terms to developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Conjunction of Moon and Planets No Disaster: Astronomer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The conjunction of the moon
and the nine planets to form a cross in the sky in 1999 is no
symbol of misfortune, but rather a normal astronomical phenomenon,
according to a senior Chinese astronomer.
</P>
<P>
Calculations indicate that the nine planets of the solar system
and the Earth's moon will form a large cross next August, with the
Earth at the intersection. This unusual astronomical event has
been interpreted by some mystics as a symbol of the end of the
world.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Junliang, director of the Shanghai Observatory, said this
extraordinary phenomenon is caused by the various revolution
cycles of the nine planets around the sun, and will not cause any
natural disasters, including earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
The solar system formed the same cross in 110 B.C., and no
major natural disasters were mentioned in historical records,
Zhao said, adding that astronomical phenomena similar to the
leonid meteor shower in 1998 will also occur in 1999, offering
golden opportunities for astronomical research and observation.

<HEADLINE> NBA Players Won't Give Final Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The NBA players union has
decided not to give its final offer to the league since the
owners refused to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
"They refused to meet with us, so we're not giving it to
them,"union attorney Jeffrey Kessler said. "That's no way to
negotiate. We sit on this until January 7 if we have to.
</P>
<P>
"If they want to find out what's in it, they're going to have
to meet. This is not a game. It's time to bargain in good faith,
and the posturing has to stop," Kessler said.
</P>
<P>
According to local press report, the union's final offer
includes an absolute maximum salary for all players. The union
previously agreed to limit the salaries of only those players
with less than 10 years' experience.
</P>
<P>
"We've already made our final offer, so if theirs doesn't
look a lot like ours then it's not going to be accepted," NBA
chief legal officer Jeffrey Mishkin said.
</P>
<P>
"We've told them that if they have a final offer then,
please, give it to us. But there's not going to be a meeting
until we see it and the committee evaluates it. For them to say
we have a meeting,that's playing games," Mishkin said.
</P>
<P>
Three months have already been lost as the sides fight over
how to divide almost $2 billion in annual revenue.
</P>
<P>
"We have assured the union that if no further meetings
between the negotiating committee are scheduled prior to January
7, the union's final proposal will be put before the Board of
Governors when it votes that day."

<HEADLINE> President Cardoso Vows to Build Solidarity in Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso vowed to build a more unified and just Brazil as he
officially started his second four-year term on the first day of
1999.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before the National Congress after being sworn in,
Cardoso said Brazil "would not have much merit being the eighth
world economy if we continue to lead in social inequality."
</P>
<P>
He noted that 10 percent of the country's richest households
control 50 percent of the nation's wealth, while the poor 50
percent of the population earns only 10 percent of the national
wealth. In the countryside, nearly 20 percent of the population
holds 88 percent of the land, while the poorest 40 percent of the
population owns just one percent.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso reaffirmed that he will fulfill the commitments made
during his election campaign to improve the distribution of
wealth, to maintain the stability of the Brazilian currency, and
to create more jobs.
</P>
<P>
He said that he will "continue to construct a stable, modern,
open, and competitive economy" and push ahead reforms in the
social security, administration, tax, political and judicial
systems.
</P>
<P>
The president also underscored the importance of dialogue with
the opposition, saying that "dialogue contributes to identify new
truths, enriches democracy, and strengthens the country."
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Create World's Lightest Electromagnetic Motor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
developed a 12.5-milligram electromagnetic motor, the lightest
in the world.
</P>
<P>
Developed by the scientists in Jiaotong University in
Shanghai, the micro-motor is expected to be powerful, durable and
able to be used in medical appliances, micro-robots and for
military applications.
</P>
<P>
Using an endoscope driven by the micro-motor, doctors will have
a clearer view of the patient's anatomy, and most of the
endoscope's operations will be automatic, according to Zhang Chen,
a leading scientist in the development program.
</P>
<P>
This electromagnetic motor can also be used on non-pilot
aircraft reconnaissance flights, Zhang said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Economy Shrinks Over 13 Percent in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's economy shrank by
13.68 percent in 1998, and may contract by 2 percent to 1.5
percent depending on the political situation at home, according to
the Central Bureau of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
"We expect the economy to grow 1.5 percent in the fiscal year
ending March 2000, depending on the political situation. If the
general election in June and the presidential selection in
November do not proceed smoothly, the economy could contract by 2
percent," bureau chairman Sugito Suwito was quoted by the
Indonesian Observer Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the strengthening of the rupiah in the last three
months of the year, the 1998 figure is better than the earlier
forecast of a 15 percent economic contraction made by the
government and the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, year-on-year inflation stood at 77.63 percent in
December, lower than November's 78.15 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the same period of 1997, inflation was recorded at 11.05
percent.
</P>
<P>
"For inflation, the best we can expect (in 1999) is about 15
percent, and this also depends on our political condition.
Disruption to the political timetable could boost it to 20
percent," Sugito said.
</P>
<P>
Sugito said the bureau expects the 1998 trade surplus to almost
double to 22.63 billion U.S. dollars, up from 11.74 billion U.S.
dollars in the previous year because of plummeting imports due to
the rupiah depreciation against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
He said exports in 1998 are estimated at 50.06 billion U.S.
dollars, 6.3 percent lower than 53.44 billion U.S. dollars in
1997. Imports are seen at 27.4 billion U.S. dollars, a 34 percent
drop against 41.68 billion U.S. dollars in the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela's Foreign Exchange Reserves Drop in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's foreign exchange
reserves closed the year 1998 at 14.85 billion U.S. dollars, down
16.64 percent compared with 1997, the Central Bank of Venezuela
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The bank attributed the drop to foreign debt payments and
central bank policies to defend the Venezuelan currency, the
bolivar, as well as speculative attacks on markets, electoral
expectations and the adverse scenario created by the falling oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
However, the bank said the existing foreign reserves would be
enough to cover imports for at least 11 months.
</P>
<P>
The bolivar faced great pressure last August and September,
but strong intervention by the central bank on the exchange
market and an increase in interest rates helped curb market
speculation.
</P>
<P>
The value of the Venezuelan currency recovered after the
landslide victory of Hugo Chavez in the presidential elections on
December 6. It afterwards underwent moderate depreciation.

<HEADLINE> Foreman-Holmes Fight Called Off (update) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The bout between
ex-heavyweight champions George Foreman and Larry Homes,
scheduled for January 23 at the Houston Astrodome, was called off
Friday, according to Foreman's brother.
</P>
<P>
"George says it's off," Roy Foreman said, adding that
promoter Roger Levitt did not meet the deadline for paying
Foreman the remaining $9 million of his $10 million purse.

Holmes said:"I don't know what's going on."
</P>

Foreman's 76-5.

<HEADLINE> Germany Welcomes Euro But Some Doubt It </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 1 (Xinhua) -- With the stroke of midnight Friday
to Saturday, the new common currency euro start to be used by some
290 million people in 11 countries in European. Germany welcomes
euro coming.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, the seat of the European Central Bank(ECB),
thousands watched at the night of Friday a huge digital clock count
down the seconds remaining until the birth of "Euroland" - the
euro currency zone reaching from Finland to southern Italy and
France's overseas territories in the Caribbean, South America and
the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
While millions across the continent were greeting the New Year
at parties, thousands of European finance sector employees were
already busy converting computer programs for the new currency.
</P>
<P>
When financial markets re-open around the world on Monday, they
will have to cope with the new currency of "Euroland" - a
commercial zone with almost one-fifth of the world's gross
domestic product.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, Germany's financial center, the start of the
monetary union was celebrated with light shows and a fireworks
display at midnight.
</P>
<P>
High-rise buildings in the financial center on the Main river
known as "Mainhattan" were decorated with the euro symbol. The
euro symbol, "e", was created by turning on lights in some offices
and leaving others darkened.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday's afternoon, over 13,000 people in front of the
building of the ECB-headquarter in Frankfurt composed a great
human symbol of the euro, to welcome the euro starting.
</P>
<P>
But some German respondent remained sceptical about the euro.
In a poll by the German Emnid polling organization, only 51
percent of 1,000 people questioned said they thought the euro was
a good idea.
</P>
<P>
In front of the building of ECZ, an old man said the euro
coming is happening too quickly. There were many problem which
were not resolved. He worried about the euro not to be stable and
strong like D-Mark.
</P>
<P>
But younger people were more optimistic. Some said, they were
happy that euro starts. It will lead to a new era in European, at
least we don't need making the headache to exchange money when we
travel in the euro-zone.
</P>
<P>
Eleven countries of the EU belong to the euro-zone. Britain,
Denmark and Sweden decided against adopting the euro in the "first
wave". Greece failed to meet the strict fiscal criteria for the
single currency.
