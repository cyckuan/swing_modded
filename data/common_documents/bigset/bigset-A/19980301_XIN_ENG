<HEADLINE> UAE Supports Emergency Opec Meeting, But With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) said Saturday that it backs an emergency Opec meeting if
"conditions" to ensure the success of the meeting are available.
</P>
<P>
The first of the conditions should be the compliance of all
Opec members with their output quotas, not a cut of Opec
production ceiling, said Minister of Petroleum and Mineral
Resources Obeid bin Saif Al Nasir.
</P>
<P>
"I welcome holding an emergency Opec meeting if all the
members are ready to cooperate for its success," he told the
UAE's official Wam news agency.
</P>
<P>
The stop of quota excess is the "basic entry" for a successful
Opec meeting, he added.
</P>
<P>
Nasir's remarks came as a response to Opec President and
Indonesia's Energy Minister Ida Bagus Sujana appeal on Friday for
an emergency Opec meeting to discuss output reduction to rescue
sagging oil prices caused by ample supplies and slackened demand
in world markets.
</P>
<P>
Prices have fallen by more than 30 percent to the
psychologically important barrier of 14 U.S. dollars a barrel in
the past months.
</P>
<P>
The price collapse was triggered by Opec's November decision
to increase its output ceiling by 10 percent to 27.5 million
barrels per day (bpd), a mild winter in northern hemisphere and
Asia's economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
But the UAE holds that exceeding quotas by some Opec members is
the major reason. The UAE estimated the excess by some Opec
members at 500,000 bpd, but experts said the figure is much higher.
</P>
<P>
So far, Opec countries took no action to prop up the falling
prices. Nasir said that currently, Opec oil ministers are in
consultations on the situation.
</P>
<P>
Oil experts say that Indonesia's appeal for trimming quotas
could stir little enthusiasm among other members.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, the two biggest Opec quota busters
have refused to lead an operation to cut off their outputs.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Nasir also called non-Opec members to "cooperate
and coordinate" with Opec countries to restabilize the markets.
</P>
<P>
He said that the slump in oil prices will not only damage
interests of Opec countries, but also countries outside Opec.
</P>
<P>
He praised non-Opec Oman's call on Friday for a meeting to
coordinate positions of world's oil producers, saying it is a
"good drive" contributing to required cooperation between Opec
and non-Opec countries.
</P>
<P>
Non-Opec countries have been piling downward pressure against
oil markets.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Urges Foreign Parliaments to Help Prevent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi National Assembly
(parliament) Speaker Saadoun Hammadi has called on his African
counterparts and the speaker of the European Parliament to work
"through all means" in a bid to prevent the use of force against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to speakers of eight African parliaments and the
European Parliament, Hammadi said the threat to use force against
Iraq without any legal justification contradicts the principles of
the Non-Aligned Movement and the stance of the world's majority,
Iraqi News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The United States has vowed to maintain its military presence
in the Gulf region despite the fact that U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan's agreement with Iraq was welcomed by all Security
Council members, including the United States.
</P>
<P>
Annan and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz signed the
agreement on peacefully ending the Iraq-U.N. crisis over arms
inspection in Baghdad last Monday. The deal is still under the
discussion in the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Washington has been insisting that it will automatically have
the right to use force against Iraq if Baghdad obstructs the work
of U.N. arms inspectors again.
</P>
<P>
Hammadi stressed that Iraq has complied with Security Council
resolutions in good faith and carried out all relevant
obligations.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq made a number of initiatives to confirm that
there are no banned weapons in the presidential sites, but the
United States has been looking for "a pretext instead of facts" to
launch military strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The speaker said the Iraqi people have suffered seriously from
the seven-year-old U.N. sanctions, which was imposed on Iraq after
its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. He said more than one million Iraqis
have died because of shortages of food and medicine supplies.
</P>
<P>
The letter was sent to parliament speakers of South Africa,
Kenya, Tanzania, Senegal, Madagascar, Ghana, Guinea, Zimbabwe and
the speaker of the European Parliament.

<HEADLINE> Hutu Extremists Renew Attacks on Central Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Armed Hutu extremists
reportedly attacked two communes of Gitarama prefecture in
central Rwanda Friday night, Rwanda News Agency Saturday quoted
officials in Gitarama as saying.
</P>
<P>
"These attacks took place last night and two communes of
Gitarama bordering northwestern Gisenyi District were targeted,"
the officials pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The communes of Nyakabanda and Bulinga are situated on the
extreme northern border of Gitarama prefecture. They have been
suffering from waves of attacks by Hutu extremists from
neighbouring communes of Kibira, Satinskyi, in Gisenyi as well as
Ndusu in Ruhengeri prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Late last year, about 2,000 Hutu rebels from neighbouring
Satinskyi commune, attacked Bulinga commune, set afire the local
mayor's residence as well as government buildings, and killed 19
people.
</P>
<P>
They also stormed the local prison and released about 600
genocide suspects. However, the majority of the prisoners later
on surrendered to government authorities.
</P>
<P>
Reports on the clashes in both communes remain sketchy and the
number of people that might have perished is so far unknown.
</P>
<P>
By mid day on Saturday, the army was reportedly still pitted
against the assailants which it was trying to crash.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean War Collaborators' Protest Enters 3rd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 28 (Xinhua) -- More than 800 liberation war
collaborators who provided intelligence and courier service to
Zimbabwean nationalist guerrillas, continued with their sit-in
protest at the ruling Zanu (PF) headquarters in Harare Saturday.
</P>
<P>
They demanded for the government to recognize their role
during the liberation war and award them monetary compensation as
has happened with their guerrillas comrades-in-arms.
</P>
<P>
Former freedom fighters were given their gratuities of 50,000
Zimbabwean Dollars (about 3,000 U.S. Dollars) each following a
series of demonstrations countrywide and the collaborators are
hoping the government will once again give in and pay them.
</P>
<P>
They want President Robert Mugabe to address them.
</P>
<P>
The government has since taken a stance that it will not pay
the war collaborators whose sit-in entered its third day
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for the collaborators Kudakwashe Mugabe said they
will not leave the headquarters even if it took them one month to
get an address from the president.
</P>
<P>
He said Zanu (PF) Party Administrator Didymus Mutasa had told
them that the politburo was going to meet and deliberate on the
issue next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said leaving the headquarters without an answer from the
president would be betraying other thousands of collaborators in
the country.

<HEADLINE> River-Damming Ceremony Held In Central Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 28 (Xinhua) -- A river-damming ceremony for
the construction of a hydropower project was held in Sindhupalchok
district, central Nepal, Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The main developer of the Upper Bhote Koshi hydropower project
is the Panda Energy International Inc., a privately held company
in the United States, while the engineering, procurement and
construction contractor for the project is the Gezhouba
Construction Group Corporation, the largest construction
corporation in hydropower in China.
</P>
<P>
The project is financed through loans led by the International
Finance Corporation, a division of the World Bank, and DEG-German
Investment and Development Company, an agency of the German
government.
</P>
<P>
The project with a capacity of 36,000 kw is expected to cost
about 46 million U.S. dollars. When completed by the end of 1999,
it can meet approximately 10 percent of Nepal's power need.
</P>
<P>
Under a 25-year agreement signed by the parties concerned, the
state-owned Nepal Electricity Authority will purchase all of the
power produced.
</P>
<P>
Nepal has a hydropower potential of 83 million kw, but so far
only less than one percent has been utilized.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, Nepal adopted a new power development policy, which
encouraged both national and foreign companies to invest in
hydropower development.

<HEADLINE> German Donor Organization Supports Zimbabwe's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe should urgently
resolve land imbalances before the situation degenerates into
chaos, a representative of an international donor organization
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
R. Schwartz of the German Fredrich-Ebert Stiftung Foundation
said the Zimbabwean government should avoid a situation where
young Zimbabweans could end up killing white farm owners to drive
them off the land as was happening in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar on land and the economic and social
perspectives in Harare, Schwartz said it was important that the
Zimbabwean government, with the involvement of all stakeholders,
pulled through the process to ensure equitable distribution of
land in the country.
</P>
<P>
Referring to various incidents in South Africa in which more
than 250 white farmers have been killed by groups of disgruntled
black people, Schwartz said this was time for Zimbabwe to pursue
the historic land redistribution exercise.
</P>
<P>
"If we do not achieve this historic process very soon, we will
soon enter the same state as the South African situation where
farmers have been killed," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said social and economic factors affecting land
redistribution should also be looked into but without
compromising the objectives of the land reform program.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has a total land area of 39 million hectares of which
5,000 white commercial farmers control 15.5 million hectares,
almost half of the total agricultural land in the country.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the seminar discussed, among other things, the
Zimbabwean government's land designation policy, legal and
procedural aspects of the land acquisition act and the social
implications of designation of commercial farms for resettlement
on the farm workers.

<HEADLINE> Arson Causes Blast in S. African Naval Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 28 (Xinhua) -- A blast that badly
damaged the offices at the Simon's Town naval base near Cape Town
early Saturday morning was due to arson, South African Press
Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
No one was hurt in the blast.
</P>
<P>
Navy public relations officer Peggy Pysden said a preliminary
investigation by military police showed that the offices had been
doused and set alight. The explosion was apparently caused by
fumes.
</P>
<P>
The Navy suspects malicious intent in the explosion at
Commodore Peter Keene's offices at about 3.40 a.m. (0140 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The probe showed the arsonist(s) broke into the office but
theft has been ruled out as a motive as nothing was taken, SAPA
said.
</P>
<P>
Damage was mostly done internally and the windows were blown
out of the building. A door to Keene's office was ejected in the
blast, Pysden said.
</P>
<P>
Keene's office suffered smoke damage. The foyer area and his
secretary's office were more extensively damaged, while a tea
room in the complex was gutted.
</P>
<P>
Pysden said no important documents were damaged in the fire.
</P>
<P>
She added that a navy guard patrolling the area about 10
minutes before the fire started did not notice anything abnormal.
</P>
<P>
Pysden said she did not know what line of investigation
military police would be following, but the possibility of
questioning navy personnel was not being excluded.
</P>
<P>
Police said they would help in the investigation if asked by
the Navy.

<P>
PARIS, February 28 (Xinhua) -- From 19,000 to 21,000 people in
France had been infected with AIDS by the end of 1997, said the
Ministry of Health on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Paris region, or Ile de France, has 8,000 to 9,000 people
infected with AIDS, representing 43 percent of the national total,
said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The number of people newly infected with AIDS in France
decreased from 3,984 in 1996 to 2,548 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The drop of new AIDS cases since the end of 1994 was attributed
to access to new anti-retrovirus treatments, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Among the people newly infected with AIDS last year, 837 were
infected due to heterosexual relations, while the rest of them
were infected through homosexual relations or using unclean drug
needles.
</P>
<P>
Forty-six percent of the newly infected people did not realize
their HIV-positive status, which indicates the lack of access to
information or to medical treatment by the poor, said the
ministry.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The 67th ordinary session
of Council of Ministers of the Organization of African Unity
(OAU) Saturday adopted a series of decisions on African political
matters and other specific issues.
</P>
<P>
On Burundi, the session condemned the massacres in Rukaramu,
and urged the government of Burundi to spare no effort in
ensuring the full participation of all segments of the society in
national debate aimed at achieving peace and stability in the
country.
</P>
<P>
With regard to Comoros, the session expressed grave concern
over the situation in that country, and underscored its
determination to ensure that the unity and territorial integrity
of the Comoros is preserved. It decided to despatch a ministerial
delegation to the Comoros led by the chairman of the council of
ministers in order to convey OAU's position to the Comorian
parties, particularly the Anjouanese one.
</P>
<P>
With regard to Sierra Leone, the session commended the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the west
African peace keeping force for their role in bringing to an end
the crisis in that country and appealed to the international
community to provide urgent humanitarian assistance for the
reconstruciton and rehabilitation of the country.
</P>
<P>
On Somalia, the session observed that the peace and national
reconciliation process is at the critical stage and urged all the
parties to work together with a view to achieving national
reconciliation. It also called on all the parties concerned with
the peace process in Somalia to coordinate their efforts.
</P>
<P>
The session expressed its concern over the continued delays of
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) in
cooperating with the United Nations on the strength of its armed
elements and UNITA's failure to allow state administration to be
extended to all areas of the country. It urged the concerned
parties in Angola, UNITA in particular, to comply with and
implement all the remaining provisions of the Lusaka protocol.
</P>
<P>
The session also agreed to set up the international panel of
eminent personalities to investigate the genocide in Rwanda and
the surrounding events and approved its terms of reference. The
session requested the OAU secretary general to ensure an early
commencement of its work.

<HEADLINE> UN Offices in Baghdad Strengthen Discipline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 28 (Xinhua) -- U.N. offices in Iraq are
strengthening discipline to ensure smooth implementation of the
agreement on weapons inspection signed by U.N. Chief Kofi Annan
and Iraq, a U.N. source here told Xinhua Saturday.
</P>
<P>
U.N. arms inspectors will soon carry out their work in Iraqi
presidential palaces, said the source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, adding that they have to act with caution when
conducting inspections, because they are required to show respect
to Iraq's sovereignty and dignity.
</P>
<P>
He said this is a very sensitive issue to the Iraqi side.
</P>
<P>
There should be neither unauthorized entry into the
presidential sites by U.N. staff nor garbages thrown by them into
the gardens of their neighbors, the source said.
</P>
<P>
A few U.N. workers have tainted the reputation of the world
organization, arousing hostility and discontent from Iraqi
people, said the source.
</P>
<P>
Some U.N. staff made loud noises and drank alcoholic beverages
in public places here, and as a result, U.N. offices in Iraq have
been receiving complaints from the Iraqis, he added.
</P>
<P>
So U.N. offices here will discipline, sometimes will sack their
employees who still invite complaints if evidences of their
misconducts are found.
</P>
<P>
Annan and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz signed an
agreement on peacefully ending the Iraq-U.N. crisis over arms
inspection in Baghdad last Monday. The deal is still under
discussion in the U.N. Security Council.

PARIS, February 28 (Xinhua) -- French Defense Minister Alain
Richard Saturday expressed his confidence in the capability of
African countries to launch regional peacekeeping operations, when
he attended a French-African joint military exercise being held in
Bakel on the border between Senegal and Mali.
</P>
<P>
The exercise, dubbed "uidimakha," is joined by troops from
France, Senegal, Mali and Mauritania and draws attention from
Western military observers, the West European Union, and the
United Nations officials.
</P>
<P>
Backed by French Mirage fighters and PUMA helicopters, the
African soldiers exercised rescuing refugees and civilians,
reported Agence France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
This is also a first test of the French-initiated concept of
building African peacekeeping capabilities -- Reinforcement of
African Capabilities for Maintaining Peace (RECAMP), which was
jointly presented to the United Nations by France, the United
States and Britain in December last year.
</P>
<P>
Richard said that France will provide logistic support to
RECAMP, which he said is "almost approved" by the United Nations
Security Council and will be submitted to the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) for examination.
</P>
<P>
France will reduce its military presence in Africa from 8,000
to 5,500 from now till 2005, and will close its military bases in
the Central African Republic.
</P>
<P>
The French defense minister also said that France will no
longer send permanent military advisors to African countries
except in special cases.

<HEADLINE> Oman, Palestine Discuss Protecting Cultural </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Omani and Palestinian
officials held talks in Muscat, Oman's capital, on Saturday to
discuss ways of protecting cultural property in Jerusalem, the
Omani news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Oman's Deputy Minister of Culture Sheikh Mohammed bin Ahmed al
Harisi and his Palestinian counterpart Yahye Hosni Abdullha
presided the meeting, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed ways of defending Jerusalem's position as
a "holy city" for Arabs, it said. The agency gave no further
detail of the talks.
</P>
<P>
Palestine, Oman and other Arab countries have repeatedly said
that Jerusalem belongs to Arabs. They also want the city to be a
capital of a future Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
But Israel, who seized East Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967
Mideast war and annexed it, rejected the appeal.
</P>
<P>
In February last year, Israel decided to build thousands of
houses in Arab Eastern Jerusalem as part of its settlement
expansion plans.
</P>
<P>
The decision, criticized by Arabs and other world countries,
has sent the Middle East peace process to a deadlock and caused
violent disputes between Palestinians and Israel.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia, Iran to Form Joint Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia and Iran
have agreed to set up a joint committee aimed at looking into
means to upgrade bilateral relations, reports reaching here from
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
This came in a joint press communique released by Saudi Press
Agency on the occasion of former Iranian president Akbar
Rafsanjani's visit to the kingdom, but no details as to when and
how the committee would be formed are disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, current Chairman of the powerful Council for the
Diagnosis of the Iranian Regime's Interests, ended his four-day
official visit in Saudi Arabia last Tuesday and headed to Mecca to
perform the Omra (lesser pilgrimage). He is still in the kingdom
now.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani told a press conference Tuesday that he held wide
scale talks with Saudi King Fahd Bin Abdul-Aziz on boosting
bilateral ties and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
His visit to the kingdom was the first by such a high
Iranian official since the Iranian revolution in 1979 when the
relations between the two countries worsened.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani underlined his country's intent to forge ties with
Saudi Arabia and all other Gulf and Arab states during his
official visit.
</P>
<P>
The communique also said both sides expressed their extreme
worries on the deterioration of the oil market conditions and
prices, and held all oil producing countries responsible for
re-stabilizing the oil market.
</P>
<P>
Both countries are ready for cooperating with other OPEC
members to re-stablize the oil market, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil has lost some 40 percent of its value in recent
months to hover just above four-year lows due to the economic
crisis in southeast Asia, increased OPEC production ceiling and
continued over-production of some OPEC members.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, the world top oil producer and exporter
producing 8.8 million barrels per day, has suffered the most
severe lost in oil earnings as the price has dropped by six
dollars a barrel compared to that of last year.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani also said there were wide horizons of cooperation
between the two countries in the oil sector, gas, marine
industries, agriculture and medicine.

<P>
MAPUTO, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican government
issued a statement Saturday condemning the referendum by the
separatists on the Anjouan Island of the neighboring Comoros.
</P>
<P>
The statement called the separatists to solve the crisis
triggered by their demand to separate from the island country

</P>
<P>
It said that Mozambican government is opposing to the
referendum carried out on February 25 and all other separatist
activities intending to separate the country.

The right direction is to "continue the dialogue brokered by
the Organization of African Unity (OAU), so as to solve the
crisis on the principles of respecting the country's sovereignty
and territorial integrity."
</P>
<P>
As one of its closest neighbors, Mozambique was asked by

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Promises His People Cultural </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba Saturday promised his countrymen cultural rights.
</P>
<P>
He told thousands of people attending this year's royal
N'cwala traditional ceremony of the Ngoni of eastern Zambia that
his government is committed to providing the necessary
environment to enable all Zambians to fully enjoy their cultural
rights, the Zambia News Agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
He told the ceremony in Chipata, eastern province that the
government attaches great importance to the preservation,
promotion and development of Zambia's diverse cultural wealth
because culture is an important aspect of national development.
</P>
<P>
Because of the importance and great value his government
attaches to ceremonies such as the N'cwala, for the first time in
the history of Zambia, a separate provision has been introduced
in this year's budget specifically to provide grants to
traditional ceremonies, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba commended paramount chief Mpezeni IV for his
leadership in encouraging his subjects to appreciate and enjoy
their cultural wealth.
</P>
<P>
He said N'cwala is one of Zambia's richest traditional
ceremonies and that is why traditional rulers are the custodians
of this country's heritage.
</P>
<P>
The House of Chiefs is likely to begin working by the middle
of this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president said a constitutional provision has been put in
place for the establishment of the house of chiefs with powers to
initiate a legislative framework on matters that related to
customary issues.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said the government fully recognizes the important
role chiefs should play in the country's development because no
economic growth could take place in communities in this country
without their full involvement.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Denounces Attacks on Egyptian Journalists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Egypt Saturday denounced the
attacks on its two journalists accredited to Paris to cover a
court session trying a controversial French writer, billing it as
an extremist act.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters, Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said "the
incident shows how far extremism can go."
</P>
<P>
Abdallah Hassan, a reporter for the Middle East News Agency,
and Sayed Hamady, for the AL Ittihad newspaper and the Saudi TV,
were attacked by a group of young Jewish extremists Friday.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place right after a French court found the
Christian-turned-Muslim Roger Garaudy guilty of questioning the
Holocaust in his book.
</P>
<P>
The attack, which occurred at an underground station and left
the two Egyptians "severe bruises," has been claimed by Petar, one
of the anti-racism group that has taken Garaudy to court.
</P>
<P>
"This act proves that extremism exists in all religions and in
all communities but we denounce all such acts of extremism and
violence," he said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Press Syndicate Saturday denounced the "extremist
group" for attacking reporters and demanding trial of Garaudy for
his book "The Founding Myths of Israeli Politics."
</P>
<P>
The organization is probing the possibility of filing a case
against Petar and urged the French government to punish the
culprits.
</P>
<P>
The French Foreign Ministry has issued a statement to express
its "deep regret" over the act, saying that the security
authorities were trying to round up the perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
The extremist Jewish youths organization of Petar issued a
statement Friday saying its members have punished some of
Garaudy's sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
Garaudy, the Christian-turned-Muslim writer in his 80s, was
fined 120,000 francs (about 20,000 U.S. dollars) for having
challenged allegations that 6 million Jews were victims of the
Nazi gas chambers during World War II. He argued that calling Nazi
crimes a genocide was "an exaggeration."
</P>
<P>
The trial has won him a growing sympathy among Arabs and
Muslims, but criticism in France. He was given a hero's welcome at
the Cairo International Book Fair this month.

<HEADLINE> Germany to Hold Vital Regional Elections on Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Voters at the western German
state of Lower Saxony will face a vital choice at local elections
on Sunday, because the outcome will help the country's main
opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD) to nominate its candidate
to challenge Chancellor Helmut Kohl in the national elections in
September.
</P>
<P>
The Lower Saxony state vote will put Gerhard Schroeder, one of
the two possible SPD chancellor candidates, against Christian
Wulff of Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party, who will
try to prevent Schroeder from winning a third term as the Lower
Saxony state premier.
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls show that Schroeder, a pro-business moderate,
would face few obstacles to win the local vote.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Schroeder has been campaigning with extraordinary
zeal because he has vowed to drop his bid for the chancellor
candidacy of the SPD if he falls two percentage points below the
44.3 percent he won in the 1994 local elections.
</P>
<P>
Kohl, who has been German chancellor for 16 years since 1982,
has already announced to seek an unprecedented fifth term in
office in the general elections scheduled on September 27 this
year.
</P>
<P>
The SPD, however, has still to resolve the rivalry between
Schroeder and the party's chairman Oskar Lafontaine, a traditional
leftist who preaches state intervention.
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls show that Schroeder would have more chances than
Lafontaine to beat Kohl in the general elections.
</P>
<P>
As being announced by the SPD last week, a final decision on
which one of them would be the party's formal chancellor candidate
could be made on Monday, based on the result of the Lower Saxony
state vote.
</P>
<P>
A strong showing at the Sunday elections would create
unstoppable momentum for Schroeder to capture the nomination,
analysts say.

TEHRAN, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini arrived here Saturday for an official visit, kicking
off ministerial contacts between the European Union (EU) and Iran.
</P>
<P>
Dini's visit is the first of its kind since the EU decided to

</P>
<P>
Dini's visit is at the invitation of Iranian Foreign Minister

</P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for Nation's Concern on Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Saturday used the recent published tests results, that show
American high school students lagging behind those of other
industrial nations, to push his education reform plan, describing
it "a wake-up call on education."
</P>
<P>
"In a global economy that is increasingly powered by
information and technology, this is a very sobering fact," Clinton
said in his weekly radio address at Salt Lake City. "We need
smaller classes, better teaching, higher standards, more
discipline, greater accountability."
</P>
<P>
The results of the Third International Math and Science Study
released on Tuesday show that U.S. 12th graders lagged behind
nearly all their counterparts in the 21-nation survey.
</P>
<P>
The president urged a renewed effort to boost classroom
performance and called on all American parents to join by
participating in the first national "Read America Day" Monday.
</P>
<P>
"I encourage parents and grandparents to get involved" in
reading out loud to their children and grandchildren, Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton urged the Senate to pass the House-passed Reading
Excellence Act to fund 210 million U.S. dollars in targeted
assistance.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has repeatedly urged the Congress and the public to put
more efforts on education ever since he assumed presidency five
years ago, and his administration has worked out a number of
programs in promoting both primary and higher education.
</P>
<P>
But Republicans on Saturday blamed the disappointing results on
Clinton administration's policies and a "hungry bureaucracy in
Washington" that gobbles up education funds.
</P>
<P>
The Republicans favor a decentralization in education. "We need
to turn back the authority and the dollars to the local level. We
need to get dollars to the classroom," said Representative Joseph
Pitts, R-Pa.
</P>
<P>
Education Secretary Richard Riley has attributed the poor
performance by the American children to easy graduation
requirements and a lack of teachers with college majors or minors
in math and science.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: OPEC Major Members Reluctant to Lead in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Although major members of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) hoped to
boost oil prices by an output reduction, none of them is ready to
lead the bloc to put the idea into practice.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, OPEC's two biggest quota busters
have made it clear that neither of them would take the first move
to rein in overproduction among the 12-member group.
</P>
<P>
Riyadh hinted last week that it would consider an emergency
OPEC meeting to trim oil output to rescue falling prices if
Venezuela takes the lead.
</P>
<P>
But the call was quickly rebuffed by Caracas who said it would
not accept any output reduction unless Saudi Arabia became the
first.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, world oil prices fell near to a collapse edge. Up to
the end of this month, prices have lost by more than 30 percent
to the psychologically important barrier of 14 dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's Minister of Mines and Energy Ida Bagus Sujana, who
is also the OPEC president, Friday called for an extraordinary OPEC
meeting to discuss lowering outputs to save the prices, but the
appeal stirred little enthusiasm among other OPEC members.
</P>
<P>
Though Iran and Qatar, two important Gulf OPEC producers, have
openly voiced their willingness to see an output cut-off, they
insisted to be only followers.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the official Qatari news agency quoted a senior
official from Qatar's Ministry of Energy and Industry as saying
that Doha's participation in an extraordinary OPEC meeting to
discuss ways of propping up sagging prices would come only when
"the majority of OPEC members decide to do so."
</P>
<P>
The United Arab Emirates (UAE), another dominant OPEC member in
the Gulf region, appeared to be less interested in production
reduction.
</P>
<P>
Responding to Sujana's call, UAE's Minister of Oil and Mineral
Resources Obeid bin Saif Al Nasir stated Saturday that Abu Dhabi
considered the priority of any OPEC meeting should focus on OPEC
members' adherence to their output quotas, not "think about a cut."
</P>
<P>
Oil experts and analysts said that so far, OPEC members' only
action was to uselessly urge each other to comply with output
quotas.
</P>
<P>
"What's the help for words?" a Gulf analyst asked. "No one
wants deeds. Production violations still continue, the (price)
decline was not halted," he said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that some OPEC members have been pumping a
large amount of oil -- estimated at 500,000 barrels per day (bpd)
beyond their official quotas.
</P>
<P>
The excess has piled additional downward pressure on world oil
markets which are trembling under the price collapse due to ample
supplies and slackened demand.
</P>
<P>
The oversupply and declined demand were triggered by OPEC's
November decision to raise its combined output ceiling by 10
percent to 27.5 million bpd, a mild winter in northern hemisphere
and Asia's economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Brokers have feared that with Iraq's return to the markets, the
down-trend in prices would accelerate.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been allowed by the United Nations to export
5.2-billion-dollar-worth of oil for buying food and medicine this
year.
</P>
<P>
Under the current prices, the new ceiling means Baghdad can
pump into oil markets up to 2 million bpd, 1.3 million bpd more
than it exported last year in the framework of an oil-for-food
deal signed with the U.N..

<P>
"This decision put an end to American and British pressures to
have the two Libyan suspects handed over for trial in either
Scotland or the U.S.," he said.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid told reporters here Saturday that the court ruling
underscores the "soundness of the Arab stance which called for
trial of the two Libyan suspects on neutral soil and in accordance
with the Scottish law and by Scottish judges."
</P>
<P>
The AL chief will discuss the issue Sunday with Secretary of
the Libyan People's External Liaison and International Cooperation
Bureau Omar al Muntassir, who is due in Cairo later Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A Pan Am passenger plane exploded in December, 1988 as it flew
over the Scottish village of Lockerbie, killing all 259 on board
and 11 people on the ground.
</P>
<P>
London and Washington wasted no time in pinning the blame on
Libya and demanding the extradition of two suspected bombers for
trial in Britain or the U.S.. Libya lodged the complaint to the
court in March, 1992 that it should be allowed to try the men
itself.
</P>
<P>
In a gesture supported by African and Arab countries, Libya
said recently it agreed to hand the suspected bombers over for
trial in a third, neutral country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa Saturday termed
ICJ's decision as "an important step to clear up the Lockerbie
case and make it possible to move on this issue."
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Assistant Foreign Minister Sayyed Qassem al Masri also
expressed the hope that the decision would lead to an accelerated
settlement to the Lockerbie issue.
</P>
<P>
"The decision is a turning point in the course of the case," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Nationwide Activities Commemorate Zhou Enlai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Some 100 university students
departed Nanjing, capital of east China's Jiangsu Province, this
morning as part of a bicycle race to Huai'an, birthplace of late
Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai.
</P>
<P>
The event was one of numerous nationwide activities held to
commemorate the centenary of Zhou's birth on March 5.
</P>
<P>
The cyclists are scheduled to arrive at the Zhou Enlai Memorial
Hall in Huai'an tomorrow afternoon. Students from Great Britain,
Australia, Cameroon and various other countries and regions are
participating in the race.
</P>
<P>
Members of literary and art circles in Shanghai, China's
largest metropolitan area, are participating in activities to
commemorate the beloved premier.
</P>
<P>
Well-known Shaoxing opera star Wang Wenjuan recalled when she
and other actresses presented the opera Dream of the Red Mansion
in Beijing in 1959. Zhou and his wife attended the performance and
later accompanied Wang on a visit to locations depicted in the
opera.
</P>
<P>
Septuagenarian Wang Jingzhi, a retired official from Shenyang
in northeastern Liaoning Province, commemorated the occasion by
watching a television show on Zhou's life. "I was deeply moved
when I first saw Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai at the
Great Hall of the People in 1968," said Wang.

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Region Linked Closely to Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Mahammat, a member of the Tartar
minority nationality in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, exhibited great surprise upon arriving in
Beijing this afternoon following a three hour flight.
</P>
<P>
"The capital is much closer than I thought. Television has
provided the only opportunity for us to witness Beijing's
beautiful scenery," according to the herdsman who is in the
capital to attend the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
Yunsuyin Yusup, a member of the Uygur nationality, commented
that he was born with New China, and has since matured with the
nation. "I fully realize that Xinjiang and Beijing, as well as all
ethnic minority groups and the Han people can never be separated."
</P>
<P>
Yunsuyin serves as Party Secretary for a township in Shache
County, China's largest county-level cotton producer with an
annual output of 50,000 tons. "Growing cotton provided the best
opportunity for local farmers to escaped poverty. However, cotton
sales would have remained as a major problem if the state had
failed to adopted an open-ended purchasing policy."
</P>
<P>
The township's four ethnic groups have never engaged in
activities which would harm national unity, said Yunsuyin, adding
that economic development relies heavily on mutual understanding
and assistance between different ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
"A very small group of people in Xinjiang are engaged in
splittist activities. However, the overwhelming majority of Uygurs
believe that safeguarding stability provides the only avenue which
will enable all ethnic groups achieve common prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Yunsuyin's views were shared by other deputies.

BANGKOK, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
left here Sunday afternoon for Indonesia for a two-day visit and
will discuss barter trade with its Association of Southeast Asian
Nation (ASEAN) neighbor.
</P>

ASEAN countries are all short of money due to the economic
downturn.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Chuan said his trip to Indonesia is merely
to give "moral support" to President Suharto since the two
countries are facing similar problems.

<HEADLINE> India Aims at 7 Percent Economic Growth for Next 5 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- India plans to achieve an
economic growth of seven percent for the next five years,
according to a draft ninth five-year plan (1998-2002) released
here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The draft plan, released by Deputy Chairman of the Planning
Commission Madhu Dandavate, sets total expenditure at 8,750
billion rupees (227.27 billion US dollars), which is a 51 percent
increase over the actual expenditure during the eighth five-year
plan period from 1992 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
The commission called for additional resource mobilization to
contain the fiscal deficit which was pegged at 5.69 percent in the
draft.
</P>
<P>
Total investment requirement during the period would be 22,052
billion rupees (about 573 billion dollars), over 50 percent of
which would be met by way of private sector contribution.
</P>
<P>
The plan seeks an annual export growth rate of 14.5 percent in
the next five years, up from 10.3 percent in the eighth five-year
plan, and import growth reduction to 12.2 percent from 14.1
percent during the previous five years.
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission accorded high priority to agriculture
with an objective to eradicate poverty and generate more
employment.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- China's first ever Construction
Law takes force today.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide activities were held to publicize the Construction
Law. Minister of Construction Hou Jie and several other leading
construction officials went to the streets to distribute printed
materials to publicize the law.
</P>
<P>
The law, which was passed last November at the 28th meeting of
the Standing Committee of the Eighth National People's Congress,
the top legislature, has 85 clauses in eight chapters. It
stipulates in detail issues such as certification of construction
activities, construction of projects, safety in construction,
project quality and the legal responsibilities of all parties
involved in construction activities.
</P>
<P>
The enforcement of the law has ended a situation in which there
was no law to abide by in construction activities and filled a
legal vacuum in project construction and the construction industry
as a whole.
</P>
<P>
China builds 240-250 million square meters of urban housing and
600 million square meters of rural housing each year. In the years
ahead the country will complete 250-300 million square meters of
urban housing per year, according to Hou.
</P>
<P>
The law will enable residents to file law suits for housing
quality problems, the minister added.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Teams Plans Drift Trip on Yalu Tsangpo River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists and explorers
are planning a drift trip along the Chinese section of the Yalu
Tsangpo River later this year. The Yalu Tsangpo becomes the
Bramaputra in India and is known as the Jamuna in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Plans for the trip were announced last Thursday by the
organizing committee for the '98 China Yalu Tsangpo River Drift
Trip. The committee was established by the Sports Commission of
the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The teams will be the first to drift the entire Chinese section of
the Yalu Tsangpo River.
</P>
<P>
The river finds its source on China's Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in
China, traverses India, and flows into the Ganges in Bangladesh before
emptying into the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese section stretches 2,075 km at the highest elevation
of any river in the world. Some 75 percent of the section flows in
the highlands at an average elevation of 3,000 meters above sea
level.
</P>
<P>
The river also features the greatest drop in elevation, falling
from an elevation of 5,070 meters abover sea level in the
west to 155 meter above sea level in the east. The river flows at
rates of as high as 83.8 km/hr in the 200-km section known as the
Great Turn Valley.
</P>
<P>
Man has never before entered various remoted stretches of the
river valley due to harsh weather conditions and unique geological
features, including rugged peaks, deep valleys and dangerous
rapids.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources indicate that the team will focus on
environmental protection studies, and anthropological studies of local
life-styles and religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
An advance team will conduct an exploratory trip through the
section in April to prepare for the drift expedition. The first
task of the advance team will be to pinpoint the source of the
river.
</P>
<P>
The expedition will begin in June and will end on the
Sino-Indian border in July.
</P>
<P>
The unique geological and environmental conditions, as well as
abundant natural resources in the area, have long attracted the
interest of both Chinese and foreign scientists.
</P>
<P>
Drifters regard the Yalu Tsangpo River as the most difficult
stretch in world. The river is, in fact, much more complicated
and dangerous than the Yangtze River, the longest river in China,
according to team leader Yang Yong.
</P>
<P>
Yang completed the first and only Yangtze River Drift Expedition
some 12 years ago. Eleven Chinese drifters lost their lives during
the expedition.

<HEADLINE> NPC Deputy Pledges to Invigorate China's Robotics Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Wang Tianran, a robotics
engineer, accepted congratulations on his election as a deputy to
the Ninth National People's Congress and was fully cognizant of
the fact that he was assuming a heavier responsibility.
</P>
<P>
"I'll continue my research on the development of robotics
development following the end of the congress," said Wang,
director of the Shenyang Automation Research Institute (SARI)
under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Wang went to work for the SARI following his graduation from
the Computer Science Department at the Harbin Engineering
Institute in 1970.
</P>
<P>
Wang's achievements in computer science attracted the attention
of Herbert Simon, a Nobel Prize winner in the United States, and
he was invited to study at Carnegie-Mellon University in U.S. city
of Pittsburgh. He returned to China in the 1980s and helped SARI
set a number of records in artificial intelligence research.
</P>
<P>
The institute succeeded in producing China's first
remote-controlled underwater robot (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle)
with the capacity for photography, videotaping and sonar testing
at depths of 6,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
The institute has since developed a dozen types of robots for
both industrial or underwater use, with many of the products
equalling the world's most advanced levels.
</P>
<P>
The institute's cable-operated underwater robot has eliminated
the need for human divers to carry out many aspects of work on
offshore drilling platforms at depths below 300 meters.
</P>
<P>
Robotics, a major aspect of high technology, is amongst the
most advanced branches of science. People around the world were
amazed at the fact that the IBM computer "Deep Blue" defeated the
world chess champion, said Wang.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China had nothing to do with the development of
Deep Blue, but has nonetheless achieved remarkable progress in the
research of artificial intelligence.
</P>
<P>
"I dream of building a complete robotics industry to ensure
that China reaches advanced world levels in the near future," said
Wang.
</P>
<P>
He readily admits the arduous task at hand, but is nonetheless
determined to translate his dream into action.

CHANGSHA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Li Mingju, an environmental
sanitation worker in Central China's Hunan Province, was sweeping
streets in a busy shopping district when she learned of her
election as a deputy to the Ninth People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
"Serving as a people's deputy will not change my status as a
worker. I will simply shoulder a new task and will reflect the
wishes of the People," said Li.
</P>
<P>
"1'll join deputies from other provinces in drafting a bill to
designate October 24th, the date of the death of model sanitation
worker Shi Chuanxiang, as Sanitation Workers Day. The bill will be
drafted in a bid to earn due social respect for sanitation workers.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, I'll call for reducing sewage pollution and for
further efforts to promote ideological and ethical progress."
</P>
<P>
Li went to the countryside following graduation from junior
middle school in 1970. She was assigned to work as a sanitation
worker in 1983.
</P>
<P>
She arrives work at 03:30 am every day and often works
overtime. Li has gone through 4,000-odd brooms over the past 15
years.
</P>
<P>
She consistently encourages colleagues to enroll in continuing
education courses and urges trade unions to assist in solving
housing problems for workers facing difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Li's diligent work ethic has won the trust of local people. Some
2,500 of a total 2,800 voters in Changde City voted for Li in
elections held earlier this year.

BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The success of the forthcoming
first session of the Ninth National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), China's top
advisory body, is of great significance, a leading CPPCC official
said today.
</P>
<P>
This year is the first year for comprehensively implementing
the tasks set forth by the 15th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) and a key year for the fulfillment of the
Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000), said Zhu Xun, Secretary-General

congress and the discussion of the major policies and arrangements
for national development in the years ahead, he said.
</P>
<P>
The success of the session, scheduled to open on March 3 and
end on March 14, is of great importance for realizing the grand
cross-century national program under the leadership of the CPC
Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The session, which will review the experience of the Eighth
CPPCC National Committee, will also be of great significance for
standardizing the system of political consultation, democratic
supervision and the participation in deliberation and
adminstration of state affairs and for bringing into full play the
role of the CPPCC in promoting socialist democracy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the session sees a new CPPCC National Committee,
whose term will continue to the next century.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the success of the session will be of tremendous
significance for pushing forward the undertakings of the CPPCC, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Besides electing the leadership of the Ninth CPPCC National
Committee, the first session will also hear and examine the work
report of the Standing Committee of the Eighth CPPCC National

JERUSALEM, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Former Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy has denied reports that he intends to return to the
current government, Israel Radio reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Levy, who resigned from his post on January 4 this year, was
quoted by the radio as saying that his Gesher party will not
return to the ruling Likud coalition.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports said last week that Levy was going to
discuss with Likud coalition chairman Meir Shetrit about his
return to the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Levy reiterated that he left the government because of his
different opinion with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over
the social policy. He noted that there has been no improvement
in the situation.
</P>
<P>
The former minister was also critical of the diplomatic policy
pursued by the government, saying that Netanyahu has not made real
efforts to push forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have been stalled for months
over the extent of Israeli next troop pullback in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The government should seek to "further the peace process,
which is good for Israel," Levy said, "We could have derived
advantages if we had led the process."
</P>
<P>
Levy's resignation left Netanyahu's government a slim majority
in the 120-seat Knesset (parliament). And some cabinet members
hope Levy will return to the government.

<TEXT>
<P>
Over the past two decades, the CPC has placed stress on younger
and more energetic laeding officials who are professionally
competent, well-educated and have high political awareness. In
recent years, the Party urged all officials to extend every
possible effort to study and grasp Deng Xiaoping Theory.
</P>
<P>
Observers noted that the new Chinese central leadership will
continue to adhere to the line of reform and opening set forth by
Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
Another major item on the NPC agenda is the examination of an
institutional restructuring plan submitted by the State
Council. The plan, seen as a major step forward in China's
political reform has aroused keen public interest and wide-spread
speculation both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Details of the plan have not as yet been released, but
authoritative sources claimed this round of institutional
restructuring will exceed all other efforts in terms of scale and
impact.
</P>
<P>
Since China started reforms in the countryside some 20 years
ago, and especially the 1992 decision to establish a socialist
market economic system, contradictions between the setup and
functions of government institutions have been one of the major
factors hampering economic restructuring and development.
</P>
<P>
The recent Second Plenum of the 15th CPC Central Committee
stressed that institutional restructuring is not only an objective
demand of tasks related to deepening economic restructuring and
developing the socialist market economy, but is also urgently
needed for building a closer relationship between the Party,
government and the broad masses of people.
</P>
<P>
Yet another major task centers on reforming the system of
leadership for the Party and the state, an important component of
political restructuring, according to the Plenum.
</P>
<P>
Although no law will be examined or adopted during this NPC
session, no one can deny the legislative strides made by the NPC
and its Standing Committee in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the Eighth NPC and its Standing Committee
formulated a record 117 laws and relevant decisions during their
five terms of office.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Jordan to Beef up Border Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Israel has contacted Jordan on
Sunday to strengthen security cooperation along their border, in
the wake of an interception of weapons and ammunitions.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli General Security Service (GSS) communicated with
its Jordan counterpart to make detailed arrangements. A
Palestinian gun runner was captured Friday night by the Israeli
Defense Force (IDF) along the northwestern shore of the Dead Sea.
</P>
<P>
The gun runner, 27, was only identified as a well-known
smuggler from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
He was seized with two motorized rubber dinghies loaded with 60
Kalashinkov assault rifles, seven shotguns, 38 pistols and
thousands of rounds of ammunitions smuggled from Jordan, the army
said.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred late Friday night when IDF soldiers were
alerted to an attempted infiltration near Ein Fash'ha, near the
Dead Sea.
</P>
<P>
Fearing the infiltration was by armed terrorists, the nearby
Jewish settlements were warned and all the roads were closed.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the night, IDF and Jordanian army officers were in
constant contact over the incident, the army added.
</P>
<P>
The weapons were being checked for fingerprints and test-fired
to see if they had been used in previous attacks or if Israeli
police had a record of them, the army said.

Legal experts noted that China has taken initial steps to
establish the framework for a legal system suited to the socialist
market economy, with related steps providing a guarantee for the
gradual attainment of the goal for managing the country in
accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
Two local delegations will attend the NPC session for the first
time. Said delegations will represent the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) which was returned to China on July
1 last year following more than 150 years of British colonial
rule, and Chongqing which was approved as China's fourth
municipality directly under the central government during the last
annual session of the NPC.
</P>
<P>
The HKSAR has maintained its economic prosperity and social
stability and successfully resisted the impact of the financial
crisis in Southeast Asia, and in so doing has proved the success
of the Chinese government's policy of "one country, two systems",
"Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and the administrative
region's high degree of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing has scored remarkable progress over the past year in
establishing the leading economy in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
Media reports indicate that over 70 percent of the deputies to
the Ninth NPC and the majority of the 2,100 members of the Ninth
National Committee of the CPPCC are serving their first
terms. Reports also show an increase in the number of experts and
representatives of grass roots units elected as NPC deputies and
CPPCC members.
</P>
<P>
The major concern of legislators will center on public opinion
related to anti-corruption efforts and building a clean
government, the reform of state-owned enterprises and the
reemployment of laid-off workers, financial problems, public
security and efforts to train and upgrade law enforcement officers.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts point out that the NPC session will be of
critical importance to ensuring full implementation of the
guidelines of the 15th CPC National Congress, and to the
attainment of the strategic goals China has set for development at
the turn of the century.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Exchange Control Gets Positive Response in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 1 (Xinhua)-- The measures taken by Vietnamese
government to tighten control over foreign exchange market has
got positive responses, Vietnam News Agency reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Most business people in Hanoi responded positively to the
measures although it is still too early to judge how effective the
decisions might be, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It said most people welcomed the government's move as a
decisive step to help address the troubles caused by money
speculators.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, the Vietnamese government announced measures to
control over the country's foreign exchange sources.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after that, on February 16, the value of the dong,
the country's national currency, was depreciated against the
U.S. dollar by 5.6 per cent, raising the official exchange rate to
11,800 dong per dollar.
</P>
<P>
This decision was described as a preventive measure to prepare
Vietnam for negative impact from the on-going financial crisis
which has gripped the region since last July.
</P>
<P>
Le Duc Thuy, deputy governor of the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV)
argued that this depreciation measure is fair and necessary to
better trigger the flow of foreign exchanges, especially the
U.S. dollar.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Supreme Court Orders Stopping Beduin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of Israel
ordered on Sunday the Israeli authorities concerned to stop the
eviction of the Jahalin Beduin tribe to a new place that is unfit
to rehabilitations.
</P>
<P>
The eviction of the Jahalin Beduin tribe is not a proper action
and there was a political motive behind their eviction, the order
said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police started from February 16 the eviction of about
35 families of Jahalin Beduin tribe near Ma'aleh Adumim Jewish
settlement, east of Jerusalem, to a village named Kedar near
Abu-Dis, also east of Jerusalem, in so-called compliance with a
1996 High Court ruling that the tribe is squatting on state land.
</P>
<P>
The police destroyed their tent homes and removed the Beduins
to the village by force. But the Beduins, totaling about 135
people, returned to their destroyed homes the next day, saying
the new place is unfit to rehabilitate.
</P>
<P>
Faisal Husseini, Palestinian minister for Jerusalem affairs,
visited the site during the eviction, saying the eviction violated
the peace accords between the Israelis and Palestinians, under
which neither side should take steps that would prejudice
negotiations on the final status of disputed lands.
</P>
<P>
Beduin tribe spokesman Mohammad Hiresh has said that they have
been living in the area for 40 years and refuse to move to the
Kedar village.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli High Court rejected last September the final
petition against the removal of the tribe, saying the Beduins
could be moved to Kedar which the Israeli government had set
aside for them.
</P>
<P>
The eviction of the Beduins by force had caused great concern
among the peace groups here. The Israeli peace group "Peace Now"
and others went to the site last week to show their support for
the Beduins.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, legal representatives of the Beduins filed a
petition to the Supreme Court, saying the Israeli police have no
right to remove them.
</P>
<P>
The order issued by the Supreme Court Sunday also pointed
out that the authorities concerned can not remove the Beduins to
an unfittable place just because of the expansion of the Jewish
settlement.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court also ordered the police to investigate the
case and report to it the fidings as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Angry Farmers March Through London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- One of the biggest demonstrations
in Britain for 20 years took place Sunday morning with up to
250,000 people from rural areas converging on London.
</P>
<P>
The protest, to oppose government policies on rural way of
life, was organized by those who are in favor of fox hunting which
is at risk from a bill before parliament.
</P>
<P>
Among the demonstrators are hunters, butchers, farmers,
landowners and thousands of others who travelled to London from
every corner of the the country. They will end up their rally in
Hyde Park early in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The march was spurred largely by opposition to next week's
parliament debate on a bill to ban hunting with hounds but
brought together rural people with a wide range of other
grievances.
</P>
<P>
"This is about the preservation of a livelihood, not the
protection of a pastime," said Paddy Ashdown, leader of the
minority Liberal Democrat party.
</P>
<P>
"I hope this will present a powerful united voice about the
threat to the rural way of life," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Apart from a campaign against the bill to ban fox hunting,
farmers, whose suffer a strong pound, are also angry at the
government's decision last December to ban beef on the bone
because of worries that mad cow disease may enter the human food
chain, despite evidence that the medical risk is tiny.
</P>
<P>
Environment Minister Michael Meacher attended the march in
support of the the countryside rally.
</P>
<P>
Blair's government is overwhelmingly anti-hunting but has
indicated it will not supply parliamentary time to allow backbench
Labor MP Michael Foster's private bill to become law.

<HEADLINE> Pests Eat Up Rice Worth 26m Dollars Annually in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Pests eat up rice worth about 12 to
18 billion taka (about 26-39 million U.S. dollars) in Bangladesh
annually, Bangladesh's Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE)
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The warm and humid climatic condition of Bangladesh is
conducive for the development of various pests of crop," the
national news agency BSS quoted DAE officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
Although chemical control has been the principal method of pest
control, it has failed to check pest attacks during the last ten
years.
</P>
<P>
The indiscriminate use of toxic pesticides is the main cause of
developing anti-insecticides resistance, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
They further pointed out that the use of toxic pesticides also
destroys beneficial insects, and upsets the balance between the
pests and their natural enemies leading to the increase in the
population of the target pests.
</P>
<P>
The use of pesticides has also increased significantly during
the last ten years, the officials added.

SHENYANG, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The electronic information
industry has become an increasingly important sector for economic
growth in northeast China's Liaoning Province, one of the
country's traditional industrial bases.
</P>
<P>
This industry began in the province in the early 1990s, and in
1977 it generated nearly 12.2 billion yuan in output value, an
increase of 13.6 percent over the 1996 figure.
</P>
<P>
The electronic information sector recorded nearly 6.76 billion
yuan in sales and 188 million yuan in pre-tax profits last year.

Liaoning is one of the country's biggest producers of printers,
industrial controls, computers, air-conditioners and
refrigerators. It also has the country's largest IC cards maker
and one of the country's largest software producers.
</P>
<P>
The use of electronic information technology has given an

especially those in the coal, metallurgy, machinery and chemicals
industries.

BAGHDAD, March 1 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian plane carrying relief
supplies for Iraqi children and a delegation arrived at Saddam
International Airport here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
This is the first foreign flight to Iraq approved by the
U.N. Sanctions Committee since U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's
Baghdad trip a week ago.
</P>
<P>
"We are here to show our solidarity with the Iraqi people and
children," said Sayed al-Bahrany, a member of the delegation.
</P>
<P>
Al-Bahrawy, a professor at Cairo University, said they have
brought with them 30 tonnes of medicines, surgical instruments,
food and toys for Iraqi children.
</P>
<P>
He said the humanitarian supplies, which worth 1.5 million
Egyptian pounds (about 440,000 U.S. dollars), are donations from
the Egyptian people from all walks of life.
</P>
<P>
The professor said some of the supplies, like anti-cancer
drugs and insulin, may not be suitable for land transportation
through Jordan because of the high temperature and long journey.
</P>
<P>
"This is our second but not the last visit to Iraq. The visit
will be repeated," he said.
</P>
<P>
More than seven years of U.N. trade embargo imposed after
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait have led to severe shortages in food and

MOGADISHU, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Five people were killed and six
others wounded when fighting erupted between rival militiamen at
the troubled airport of the southern port town of Kismaio in
Somalia Saturday, according to reports available here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The VHF radio reported that the fighting broke out after two
small Cesna planes transporting the narcotic leaves of khat from
Kenya had arrived at the airport where the rival militiamen
squabbled over its ownership.
</P>
<P>
One of the warring gunmen was killed inside the airport in the
shoot out that ensued the dispute, and one of the two Cesna planes
that brought the khat sustained a damage caused by the exchange
of fire.
</P>
<P>
As the shooting continued, one of the groups fighting for
control of the khat consignment was chased away.
</P>
<P>
However, the fighting then spread to the town center of
Kismaio, 500 km south of the capital, where the armed militiamen
exchanged heavy gunfire, panicking the population whom many of
closed down their businesses immediately.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, four more militiamen were then killed
and several others were wounded inside the town. Sources close to
the town militiamen said the rival sides were from the Ogaedn and
Majerten subclans living together in the town.
</P>
<P>
Elders from the two sides and women groups took to the streets
in an effort to stop the killing Saturday afternoon. Clan
chieftains and religious leaders are now mediating the two sides
as the town remains calm, but tense Sunday morning.

JOHANNESBURG, March 1 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and its

behind a major program to contain malaria in the region, South
African Press Association (SAPA) reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Initiated by the South African government-funded organization, the
Lubombo Spatial Development Initiative (SDI), the program will
concentrate its activities in South Africa's Kwazulu-Natal
Province, eastern Swaziland and southern Mozambique.
</P>

SPAP quoted a statement from the Lubombo SDI as saying that a
recent survey had shown that high rates of malaria in the region
was one of the major reasons for continued underdevelopment in
these areas.
</P>
<P>
The research also indicated that malaria in the region was
closely connected to the high incidence of other killer diseases
such as diarrhea and chest infections.

<HEADLINE> Relief for Hebei Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, March 1 (Xinhua) -- A prolonged drought affecting
large areas of north China's Hebei Province has been alleviated
due to a welcome spell of rain in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
Information from the provincial flood control headquarters
showed 95 counties in the province reported precipitation above 10
mm as a result of consecutive rainfall. This rainfall is
concentrated mainly around Baoding and Cangzhou, two major
wheat-producing areas.
</P>
<P>
The drought, which hit Hebei last April, caused a drop in the
output of autumn crops on 1.93 million ha of farmland, and
drinking water problems for 1.15 million people and 2.03 million
head of domestic animals.
</P>
<P>
The province witnessed a decrease of one billion kg in grain
output last year.
</P>
<P>
An official from the headquarters warned that the drought, the
worst since New China was founded in 1949, has not been completely
relieved by the rainfall over the past few days.
</P>
<P>
According to him, 533,333 ha of wheat fields and the spring
sowing on one million ha of farmland are in jeopardy due to low
precipitation in the southern parts of the province.

1947.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 280,000 civilian and army personnel will conduct

<HEADLINE> Angolan Government to Fight UNITA Sabotage: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government has warned
that it will fight against the opposition UNITA activities
damaging the peace process to ensure the realization of final
peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
Minister of the Interior Pitra Petroff said Saturday at a
ceremony marking the 22nd anniversary of the foundation of
Angolan National Police that the police will take actions to
fight activities by members of the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola intended to destroy the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In the recent days, the remanent UNITA soldiers committed
looting, burning, attacking and killing in former
UNITA-controlled areas where local governments were just re-set
up. The sabotage has caused panic, disturbed public order and is
also threatening the peace process in the country.
</P>
<P>
Petroff noted that by the end of last month, all the
requirements of the 1994 Lusaka peace agreement should have
fulfilled and final peace should also have been realized in
Angola.
</P>
<P>
However, the targets have not been reached because of the
sabotage by the UNITA members, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Higini Carmeiro, the government spokesman in the Joint
Commission of the Angolan Peace Process, reiterated Saturday that
the government has issued warnings to the UNITA for its
destabilizing activities.
</P>
<P>
If the situation does not improve, the government will take
necessary steps to ensure the development of the peace process,
he stressed.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: East Asia's Debt Crisis Far From Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- As the East Asian financial crisis
entered its ninth month now, currencies and stocks of the region
are bouncing back from a steep downturn in early January, partly
due to a reprieve in the region's debt crisis.
</P>
<P>
By Friday, the Philippines' currency peso has appreciated to 40
to the dollar from 46 peso in the second week of January, while
its stock index climbed to 2,266 from 1,600 six weeks ago.
Currencies and stocks of other East Asian countries are also
surging steadily, though slowly in countries like Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the market stabilization, some economists
declared that the worst of the crisis, which started last July, is
over.
</P>
<P>
But most economists remain cautious about the market
development, as the region's debt crisis, a major cause of the
financial turmoil, is far from resolved.
</P>
<P>
In the past two months, debt-ridden countries in East Asia have
tried to ease the crisis by restructuring short-term foreign debts
into long-term loans, especially the debts owed by private
corporations.
</P>
<P>
On January 29, South Korea, whose foreign debt stood at 153
billion dollars by the end of last year, reached agreement with
international bankers on rescheduling 24 billion dollars of
short-term debts.
</P>
<P>
The deal swaps nearly one-fourth of South Korea's total debt
coming due this year for longer-term loans guaranteed by the
government. The newly extended debt will mature in one to three
years.
</P>
<P>
The landmark pact on debt rescheduling gave South Korea a
significant relief from its financial crisis. The country's
financial market has reacted positively since then.
</P>
<P>
Following South Korea's relief from the short-term debt crisis,
British banks, at the request of the Philippines, agreed in
February to reschedule most of short-term debts owed by the
Philippines to help the country cope with the crisis.
</P>
<P>
According to the Philippine Central Bank, the country's total
foreign debt has amounted to 40.48 billion dollars, of which 8.5
billion dollars are short-term debts.
</P>
<P>
In Indonesia, representatives of foreign bankers and Indonesian
corporate borrowers are negotiating the restructure of the
country's 73 billion dollars of private borrowings.
</P>
<P>
However, in view of the high levels of foreign debts in the
region, any debt restructuring could only provide a temporary
relief and does not signal the end of pains, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
In the East Asian region, excluding Japan, there were 370
billion dollars in international bank loans as of last June, some
242 billion of which had a maturity of less than one year. About
188 billion dollars of loans were to private companies and 171
billion dollars were to banks. The amount does not include loans
from the IMF, the World Bank and other international institutions.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that such borrowing seemed sensible when East
Asian countries enjoyed stable exchange-rate target bands
vis-a-vis the dollar. But when currencies of Southeast Asian
countries and South Korea lost more than half of their value
against the greenback, the private sectors could hardly afford to
make their debt payments.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has an estimated 140 billion dollars in foreign debt,
of which 73 billion dollars are owed by the private sector.
Servicing that private sector debt now costs four to five times as
much in rupiah terms as it did last July.
</P>
<P>
In South Korea, after the rescheduling of 24 billion dollars in
short-term debts that South Korean banks owe to foreign lenders,
about 40 billion dollars of short-term private debts owed to
foreign creditors are coming due this year.
</P>
<P>
Also outstanding are 86 billion dollars in long-term foreign
debts and a mountain of domestic debt totaling 590 trillion won
(about 368 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that without serious prospects of debt reduction,
currencies will resume their freefall, and without stable
currencies the debt burden will keep mounting.
</P>
<P>
At present, regional currencies and stocks seem stable, but
they could be hit by a new round of financial storms any time
unless the debt crisis is resolved, they said.
</P>
<P>
As the East Asian crisis does not only affect the region's
economy but also the world growth, experts suggested that as a
first step, global leaders should appoint an emergency task force
that would have real clout to deal with the problem on a regional
basis.
</P>
<P>
The next step, they said, would be to expose all of the bad
debts that remain hidden, as lenders need a firm idea on how much
more is needed to fix the problem.
</P>
<P>
The third step is to stabilize the currencies before
hyperinflation hits, they said.
</P>
<P>
Some economists proposed the establishment of a stabilization
fund of about 100 billion dollars to help meet emergency liquidity
needs, with the participation of G-8 nations and rich countries.
</P>
<P>
The proposals, if adopted, could help East Asian countries
alleviate their debt burden and tide over the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
But the industrialized countries are at present cool toward
these proposals and the debt crisis is unlikely to be resolved in
the months ahead.

<HEADLINE> China's Use of Overseas Investment Reaches Critical Turning Point </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The financial crisis in East and
Southeast Asia has pushed China to a critical turning point in
overhauling its foreign investment structure, an economist has
warned.
</P>
<P>
"It's high time that China shift its focus for attracting
foreign investment more from Asian sources to developed Western
countries," the China Daily's Business Weekly said today, quoting
Zhou Shijian, vice-president of the China Chamber of Commerce of
Metal, Mineral and Chemical Importers and Exporters.
</P>
<P>
Global multinational direct investment reached 320 billion US
dollars by the end of 1996 and 62 percent of the amount had been
made by the Big Five: the United States, Britain, Japan, Germany
and France, according to the 1997 World Investment Report issued
by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, the Republic of Korea and Southeast Asian countries
-- suppliers of nearly 70 percent of China's foreign investment,
accounted for only 5,7 percent of the global total.
</P>
<P>
"This means that our foreign investment structure is terribly
unbalanced," Zhou said. "The kind of imbalance means that China's
foreign investment will be adversely affected by the ongoing Asian
financial crisis."
</P>
<P>
China's heavy-weight foreign investment sources, obsessed with
their own domestic problems, have been cutting back on their
overseas investment plans.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, these countries and regions have adopted a series of
preferential policies to attract foreign investment, thus becoming
competitors of China for Western capital, Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
Due to the cancellation of tariff exemptions, contracted
foreign investment dropped last year by 29.3 percent to 51.78
billion US dollars, an indication that the amount of foreign
capital that China can actually use this year will shrink
significantly.
</P>
<P>
The trend, however, is likely to be reversed now that China has
resumed the preferential tax policies given to foreign investors
in favored sectors, Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of preferential policies, especially those in
high technology sectors, will encourage Western companies to
provide high technology to China, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the strengthening of bilateral relations between
China and the European Union, the United States and Japan has
laid a sound basis for economic cooperation, Zhou added.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Build First Coal-fired Thermal Power Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina on Saturday laid the foundation stone for a 300-megawatt
coal-based thermal power plant, the first of its kind in the
country, press reports said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the coalpit power plant in Barapukuria,
Dinajpur district, north Bangladesh, which has an estimated cost
of 16.63 billion taka (about 362 million U.S. dollars), is
scheduled to be completed in 2001-2002.
</P>
<P>
Some 830,000 tons of coal to be extracted from the Barapukuria
mine, which has an estimated coal reserve of 390 million tons,
will be used each year to generate electricity to meet the demand
in districts in the north of the country, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the 200 million-dollar coal mine, with
assistance from Chinese technicians and workers, will be completed
in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Hasina asked officials in charge of the mine project to speed
up construction so as to complete the project on schedule.
</P>
<P>
Development on a massive scale will start in the area once the
coal mine and the power plant are completed, she said.
</P>
<P>
"A new horizon will be opened in the energy sector after the
completion of this project," Petrobangla Chairman Mosharraf
Hossain said.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Determined to Bring Down Budget Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government pledged to
take measures to cut expenditure in a bid to bring down budget
deficits, Kenyan Finance Minister Semeon Nyachae has said.
</P>
<P>
Nyachae noted in a statement issued on Saturday that "limited
resources available to the government would only be allocated to
emergency and extremely essential services."
</P>
<P>
The statement followed an announcement made by that the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) last Friday that it would not
provide any funds before this year's budget to be made in June.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held last Friday after talks with the
kenyan government, Goodall Gondwe, Deputy Director of the IMF's
African Department, said that Kenya's current budget deficit was
estimated at 3.9 percent of its Gross Domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that IMF had agreed on policy measures with the
government to bring down the deficit to 2.4 percent at the end of
the fiscal 1997/98 year (July to June).
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan finance minister said that his government was
committed to the full implementation of measures agreed with the
IMF mission, in order to reduce government borrowing and interest
rates, the local press reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that the talks with the IMF also discussed the
evasion of duty by some Kenyan sugar importers and added that one
of the sugar importers had been followed and made to pay duty.
</P>
<P>
The IMF suspended a 205 million U.S. Dollars loan package
under its soft-term Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility
(ESAF) arrangement in July last year to reinforce its protest
against graft and poor governance in Kenya's economy.
</P>
<P>
Following two-week talks with the government, the IMF mission
which arrived in Nairobi on February 9, has said that a possible
negotiation on ISAF loan could begin after this year's budget
which is to be made in june, "if things are very well".

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has
appealed to workers not to take part in the Zimbabwe Congress of
Trade Unions-induced work stayaway on Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference on the proposed work boycott on
Saturday, Minister of Industry and Commerce Nathan Shamuyarira
said: " We think the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions is being
misguided and misleading the workers. We appeal to the workers to
go to work on Tuesday and Wednesday."
</P>
<P>
He warned that the government will not allow people to
continue disrupting services and the work process.
</P>
<P>
People should not be misled into believing that the government
was being insensitive to their problems, Shamuyarira added.
</P>
<P>
He said: "The government is concerned about rising
prices and we are doing our best to maintain them at the present
levels and to reduce them where ever possible."
</P>
<P>
The trade unions have called for the two-day work stayaway to
press the government to scrap some of its taxes and to resolve
the recent food price hikes.
</P>
<P>
According to Shamuyarira, the government had told manufacturers
to scrap the 21 percent increment on maize meal, 25 percent on
bread and 20 percent on cooking oil.

<HEADLINE> Facts and Figures About Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jakarta, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's People's Consultative
Assembly (MPR) Sunday opened its 11-day General Session in Jakarta
which will endorse the State policy Guidelines for the next five
years and elect a president and a vice president.
</P>
<P>
Here are some facts and figures about the country:
</P>
<P>
Geography -- Indonesia, the largest archipelago nation in the
world, consists of a group of about 17,500 islands, lying between
the mainland of Southeast Asia and Australia. The islands stretch
from the Malay peninsula to New Guinea. It has an area of 1.9
million sq. kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Population -- With a population of 202 million by the end of
December 1997, Indonesia is the fourth most populous nation in the
world after China, India, and the United States. It is home to
more than 300 ethnic groups and scores of languages and dialects.
The country includes an urban middle class and tribes barely out
of the stone age.
</P>
<P>
Official language -- Bahasa Indonesia, based on the Malay
language indigenous to the region, is the unifying language among
more than 200 distinct regional languages.
</P>
<P>
Capital -- Jakarta with a population of more than nine million.
</P>
<P>
Religion -- About 88 percent of the 202 million inhabitants say
they are followers of the Sunni branch of Islam, making it the
world's largest Muslim country. Roughly 10 percent is Christian
(Protestant and Roman Catholic) and approximately two percent
Hindu and Buddhist.
</P>
<P>
Economy -- Sustained economic growth pushed per capita gross
domestic product from 60 U.S. dollars in the late 1960s to 1,089
U.S. dollars in 1997. The economy boomed in the 1970s with oil and
natural gas exports and diversified in the 1980s to create a
wide-ranging manufacturing base. However, the country's economy
has been hit badly since July last year by the monetary crisis
with the rupiah's value having dropped by about 80 percent and
many economic activities being scaled down.
</P>
<P>
Currency and Exchange Rate -- The rupiah is now trading at
8,000 to 9,000 per dollar. It traded at 2,400 per dollar in July
last year.
</P>
<P>
Armed Forces -- 500,000 including the police forces.
</P>
<P>
Government -- Indonesia declared independence from the
Netherlands and Japan on August 17, 1945. The government is
structured as a unitary republic; the 1945 constitution vests the
highest authority in the People's Consultative Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Head of State -- President Soeharto, in power since 1966, was
re-elected in March 1993 for his sixth five-year term. Vice
president Try Sutrisno was elected in the same year.
</P>
<P>
People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) -- The MPR, as the
nation's highest state institution, has the full right to make
decisions on the issues of the presidency. The 1945 constitution
vests the highest authority in the MPR.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Economic Growth Drops to 4.7 Percent in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto said
here Sunday that the country's economic growth in 1997 slowed down
to 4.7 percent from eight percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening of the General Session of the People's
Consultative Assembly, Soeharto said that during the first four
years of the sixth five-year development plan (1994-1999),
economic growth reached an average of 7.1 percent annually, the
same as the revised annual target for the period.
</P>
<P>
In an accountability report submitted to the five-yearly
session, Soeharto said the growth rate was sustained by the
increase of direct investment as the essential motor of economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The approved domestic investment rose 150 percent and foreign
investment rose three-fold during the four years.
</P>
<P>
The population growth rate continued to drop and it stood at
1.54 percent in 1997, he said.
</P>
<P>
With such economic and population growth rates, Indonesia's
per-capita income rose from 2.7 million rupiah in 1996 to 3.1
million rupiah in 1997, Soeharto said.
</P>
<P>
In U.S. dollar terms, the per-capita income in 1993 was 842
dollars, and it rose to 1,155 dollars in 1996. However, due to the
depreciation of the rupiah, the per-capita income in 1997 dropped
further to 1,089 dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the rising prices of essential commodities since
the middle of 1997, the inflation rate for the entire 1997 soared
to 11.1 percent compared with 5.2 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
During the first 10 months of the 1997-98 fiscal year starting
April 1, the inflation rate reached 16 percent, also spurred by
the long draught that has led to the decline of agricultural
production and price increases for food-stuffs.
</P>
<P>
On foreign trade, Soeharto said export had grown slower than
import since the 1993-94 fiscal year and as a result, the current
account deficit rose from 2.9 billion dollars or 2.1 percent of
the GNP in 1993-94 to 8.1 billion dollars or 3.5 percent of the
GNP 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
The significant rupiah depreciation in the middle of 1997-98
has made the current account deficit fall to 4.3 billion dollars
or 2.2 percent of the GNP.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto said the country's debt reached 136.1 billion dollars
by the end of December 1997. The private debt was 82 billion
dollars or 60.2 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
"Our external debt servicing burden is really heavy. But the
government has enough funds and foreign exchange to honor its
obligations," he promised.
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, we are now facing a very serious economic hardship.
But we are confident that by working hard and implementing the
programs we have formulated, we will definitely be able to
overcome these difficulties," Soeharto said.
</P>
<P>
He also said the government will make great efforts to develop
industry, agriculture, tourism and transportation sectors to
create jobs for the poor who have been hit hard by the current
monetary crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 members of the House attended the opening ceremony
of the 11-day General Session.
</P>
<P>
The legislators will deliberate and endorse the State Policy
Guidelines for the next five years, and elect a president and a
vice president during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the General Session is virtually
certain to re-elect Soeharto for his seventh five-year term and
also elect State Minister for Research and Technology Jusuf
Habibie as vice president, as five factions at the House have all
agreed to their nominations.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Flower Exports to Germany Banned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Millions of dollars worth of
Zimbabwe's flower exports to Germany have been banned
because of non-compliance with the German packaging legislation,
the local paper Sunday Mail reported.
</P>
<P>
As environmental concerns are beginning to play an increasing
role in international business, some local products have started
experiencing problems as exporters are facing increasing
pressures to meet some requirements of environmental quality, the
paper said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The banned flowers were reportedly returned because their
packaging was not environmentally friendly. A strong
eco-packaging movement has been lobbying the whole of the
European market to insist on packaging with recyclable
substances.
</P>
<P>
Although the Export Flower Growers' Association of Zimbabwe
said that none of their growers had complained about
flowers being returned because of eco-packaging problems, a
Zimbabwe trade source confirmed that some flowers had been
returned.
</P>
<P>
A preliminary report by the German Development Institute on
"challenges and opportunities for Zimbabwean exports arising from
environmental requirements in Europe" has also cited the incident
as saying it was of critical importance for Zimbabwean exporters to be
informed about and to comply with the relevant packaging
regulations.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that Zimbabweans were at one time forced
to import packaging material to continue exporting
flowers to Germany.
</P>
<P>
Following the environmental lobbying, countries in Europe have
been pro-active in developing these eco-packaging systems to a
point where some of the regulations have started posing a threat
to the export markets of developing countries like Zimbabwe,
according to the report.

<HEADLINE> China's Car Imports Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- China's automobile imports
declined sharply last year as domestic car makers expanded
production and tariff reductions cut profit margins, the China
Daily reported today in its Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of last year, China imported 32,624
motor vehicles, according to figures of the General Administration
of Customs.
</P>
<P>
"If the trend continued in the fourth quarter, imports for the
whole year would have stood at almost 43,500 units, 47.1 percent
down from the 1996 figure," said Chen Ping, vice-president of the
China Trading Center for Automobile Imports, China's largest
authorized dealer of imported cars.
</P>
<P>
Chen's estimate is down 55.8 percent on 1991, 79.3 percent on
1992, 86 percent on 1993, 84.5 percent on 1994, and 72.4 percent
on 1995.
</P>
<P>
But industry insiders said that actual statistics may differ
because of smuggling and unsold stocks left idle in bonded zones.
</P>
<P>
China imported 18,726 sedans in the first three quarters of
1997, with year-round figure estimated at 24,968 units, down 55.7
percent from 1996.
</P>
<P>
Japan was the largest sedan exporter to China with 15,646 units
sold in the first nine months, followed by the Republic of Korea,
the United States, Russia, Germany, the Czech Republic and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Imported cars fit primarily in the 1.5-1.6 litre and 2.0-2.2
litre engine range.
</P>
<P>
While overseas-funded enterprises, financial firms and private
entrepreneurs are most likely to buy this kind of luxury cars,
more rich Chinese are opting for foreign cars with automatic
gearboxes, according to Chen.
</P>
<P>
She said that China's rigorous measures to curtail imports of
car body and components have curbed illegal assembly of the costly
sedans.
</P>
<P>
Many car importers have been hit hard by the tariff cuts on auto
imports last October and the intensifying price cutting in China.

<HEADLINE> China's Locomotive Industry Heading on Right Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- China's locomotive and railway
equipment manufacturing industry will continue to steam ahead as
the country is set to speed up railway construction.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government plans to invest 330 billion yuan (about
40 billion US dollars) in railway construction between 1996 and
2000, 250 billion yuan on railway track and affiliated equipment,
and 80 billion yuan on locomotive and rolling stock, the China
Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Works has over the past
decade manufactured 2,200 diesel locomotives, thus saving foreign
currency estimated at one billion US dollars. This year it
exported 26 electric diesel locomotives to such countries as
Nigeria, Tanzania and Zambia, earning 35.6 million US dollars in
foreign exchange, which made it China's top locomotive exporter.
</P>
<P>
The enterprise has developed a variety of locomotives through
technical cooperation with counterparts in the United States and
Britain. These efforts paid off when it was awarded international
ISO9000 quality certification.
</P>
<P>
The Qiqihar Rolling Stock Works, in northeastern Heilongjiang
Province, exported in 1997 alone 394 carriages to Myanmar, Nigeria
and Indonesia, with orders totalling 116 million yuan (about 14
million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Li Dongming, an expert with China Railway Technology Institute,
proposed that more advanced technology be introduced from abroad
to develop locomotives and carriages suitable for high-speed
railways, as the central government is considering starting
construction of these lines on a huge scale in the next few
years.
</P>
<P>
China has 6,500 refrigerated trains in operation, but 80
percent of the perishable goods such as aquatic food and
vegetables have to be transported by more antiquated freight
trains, with losses during transportation estimated at one third
of the value of the goods.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Official on Drafting of Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- A senior Myanmar official said
efforts are being made to draft a new state constitution through
the National Convention and that only an enduring constitution can
ensure lasting peace and development in the country, the New Light
of Myanmar reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt, who is first secretary of the Myanmar
State Peace and Development Council, made the remarks when meeting
a visiting delegation of the Young Presidents Organization of the
United States here Saturday, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Khin Nyunt briefed the delegation about Myanmar's ongoing
National Convention and the drawing up of the new constitution. He
also talked about the future of the country's states, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Khin Nyunt said 50 percent of the work of the National
Convention has been completed.
</P>
<P>
Once an agreement on the sensitive issue of power-sharing
between the central government and the states as well as among the
states themselves is reached, the work of the National Convention
will be greatly sped up, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar National Convention began in January 1993 to lay
down principles for drawing up the new constitution after the May
1990 general election. The convention was adjourned in March 1996.
</P>
<P>
"After the new state constitution is promulgated, there will be
elections, and a constitutional government will lead the nation
into the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the military government has no intention whatever to
hold on to power for a long time. "The Armed Forces will
definitely transfer power to the constitutional government."
</P>
<P>
He added that the Armed Forces are "paving the way and laying
down the foundation for the emergence of a multi-party democratic
system."

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Scrips surged up to a strong
finish, lifting the sensitive index by over 204 points on the
Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) market during the week, as operators
built up long positions enthused by sustained purchases by foreign
funds.
</P>
<P>
The BSE sensitive index spurted sharply to close the week at
3,622.22 as against last weekend's close of 3,417.30, netting
204.92 points.
</P>
<P>
The national index shot up by 96.85 points to end the week at

<HEADLINE> Soeharto Pledges to Continue Economic Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto said
on Sunday that his government will continue to implement the
economic and financial reforms and restructuring programs which
have the support of the IMF in a bid to overcome the current
monetary crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
In an address delivered at the opening of the General Session
of the People's Consultative assembly, Soeharto said the key to
the problem is the stabilization of the exchange rate of the
rupiah (national currency) at a reasonable level.
</P>
<P>
"Unless this is achieved, I do not see any possible improvement
within the short period of time," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Since mid-July last year, the rupiah has lost about 80 percent
of its value against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
As a whole, the rupiah's exchange rate continues to be weak and
hovers around 9,000 to 10,000 rupiah to the dollar these days, he
said. In early July last year, the rupiah traded at 2,400 per
dollar.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the currency crisis, corporations are facing
serious difficulties and are scaling down their activities.
Unemployment has begun to rise and prices of imported goods,
including medicine, are also soaring.
</P>
<P>
During the 11-day convention, legislators will deliberate and
endorse the State Policy Guidelines for the next five years, and
elect a president and vice president.
</P>
<P>
After briefing the 1,000 legislators on measures the government
has taken to cope with the crisis, Soeharto said there are no
signs yet that the situation is improving.
</P>
<P>
The people's life is becoming more difficult, he admitted.
</P>
<P>
"This is the reason why I have asked the IMF (International
Monetary Fund) and other heads of government to assist us in
finding a more appropriate alternative," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever measures we shall take, we need the support of the
IMF as the authoritative and highly reputed international
financial institution," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed: "Undoubtedly, in the end, our fate rests
in our own hands."
</P>
<P>
"Our determination is firm to overcome the problem we are now
facing. We shall fight all-out to extricate ourselves from the
crisis," he noted.

HONG KONG, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Ninety-nine Hong Kong members of
the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) left here for Beijing on Sunday
for the First Session of the Ninth CPPCC National Committee
scheduled to open on March 3.
</P>
<P>
They were seen off at the Kai Tak International Airport by
Zheng Guoxiong, deputy director of the Xinhua News Agency Hong
Kong Branch.
</P>
<P>
Before departure, they told reporters that they felt honored to
be able to attend the CPPCC National Committee session, and
pledged active participation in state affairs.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with Xinhua, Chu Lien Fan, who was also
member of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee, said the CPPCC
National Committee faces a heavy task of pushing forward the cause
of the people's political consultation into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"It is a great honor to experience the historic event of Hong
Kong's return to the motherland, contribute to the country's
modernization drive and social progress, implement the principle
of 'one country, two systems' and promote the cause of the
reunification of the motherland," she said.
</P>
<P>
During a separate interview, Henry K.S. Cheng, managing
director of the New World Development Co., Ltd., said the duties
and obligations of the Hong Kong members of the CPPCC National
Committee remain unchanged after Hong Kong's return to the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
"Our task is to participate in state affairs. We will refrain
from interfering in what falls within the autonomy of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zee Sze-yung, professor of botany at the Hong Kong University,
who served as a deputy to both the Seventh and Eighth National
People's Congress (NPC), said the issue that he cares most is the
complementarity of the judicial systems of the Chinese mainland
and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The total number of the Hong Kong members of the Ninth CPPCC
National Committee from the specially invited group and other
sectors in Hong Kong is 151.
 Other Hong Kong members of the CPPCC National Committee will
leave for Beijing later.

<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Portugal accumulated 300 tons
of gold through its trade with Nazi Germany during World War II,
Costa Leite, professor with the New University of Lisbon, said
here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Leite, also chairman of a committee set up by the Central Bank
of Portugal investigating the trade, disclosed Portugal's huge
accumulation of Nazi gold at the end of a two-day seminar titled
"Wartime Economy and Nazi Gold."
</P>
<P>
According to historical documents, Nazi Germany sold a great
deal of gold looted from POWs and refugees to Portugal and some
other countries through the Swiss banking system.
</P>
<P>
Gian Trepp, a Swiss participant of the seminar, pointed out
that the Portuguese government in World War II had been fully
aware of the "high risk" in exchanging goods for Nazi gold
directly.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to deceive the public after 1942, Portugal opened a
Portuguese currency market in Switzerland to enable Nazi Germany
to pay its imports from Portugal by selling its gold to the Swiss
banking system.
</P>
<P>
At the seminar, many Portuguese experts also called on the
Central Bank of Portugal, the Portuguese Foreign Ministry and the
police authorities to make public the secret gold-trade-related
documents.

BANGKOK, March 1 (Xinhua) -- An opinion poll released Saturday
showed that most Thai people are satisfied with the government's
performance in handling economic affairs, the Bangkok Post

The survey, released by KSC-ABAC Internet Poll Research Center,

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Continue Pipeline Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Thailand would continue the
construction of a Thai-Myanmar gas pipeline through rich forests
despite difficulties confronting the two countries, Thai Prime
Minister Chuan Leekpai has said.
</P>
<P>
"I have decided that the project must continue. I don't have
the right to stop it," Sunday's Bangkok Post quoted Chuan as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Chuan recently appointed a panel to study the project which
would bring natural gas from Myanmar to Thailand. But the panel
raised observations on several shortcomings such as environmental
effects, prompting criticism of the project and calls for
scrapping the construction.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent response to the criticism, Chuan said: "My
opinion is that the project cannot be scrapped. It must continue.
However, observations raised by the panel are useful. They will be
passed on to concerned agencies for further action."
</P>
<P>
Chuan made the remarks while inspecting the construction site
in Kanchanaburi in west Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline, which will pump natural gas from Myanmar's Yadana
gas field in Andaman Sea to a power plant in Ratchaburi province
of Thailand, was suspended amid protests by conservationists who
said the construction would damage forests and community areas.
</P>
<P>
Construction workers resumed work on the pipeline after Chuan's
inspection tour.

<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- No longer satisfied with the
traditional business of accepting deposits and extending loans,
China's major commercial banks are actively pursuing investment
banking.
</P>
<P>
Those banks include Industrial and Commercial Bank of China
(ICBC), Bank of China (BOC) and China Construction Bank (CCB),
according to China Daily Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
The ICBC nailed down a deal last week to acquire a major share
of the Asian equities and corporate finance business of
NatWest. This will enable it to set up a finance company in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
The BOC plans to expand and restructure its investment banking
business by moving its investment banking headquarters from London
to Hong Kong and hiring more staff this year, Business Weekly said.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the CCB was at the forefront of

International Capital Corp, its joint venture with US investment
bank Morgan Stanley.
</P>
<P>
The commercial banks's venturing into international investment
banking "fits in well with the pace of China's opening up," a
senior official with the Foreign Financial Institute Department of
the People's Bank of China, the central bank, was quoted as
saying.

<HEADLINE> Economic News Briefs From Mercosur Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are recent
economic news briefs from the Southern Common Market (Mercosur),
which is the biggest commercial bloc in South America grouping
Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, with Chile and Bolivia as
its associate members:
</P>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES -- The Argentine government approved February 26 a
law project for a tax reform that will halve the 21 percent value
added tax applied to products of the basic staples basket, as part
of a tax reform project to be presented to the Congress.
</P>
<P>
Economy Minister Roque Fernandez said the measure will have an
impact similar to a three percent increase to the salaries under
1,500 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO -- Brazilian iron ore exports increased 9.1
percent in 1997 in value and 8.2 percent in volume over 1996.
</P>
<P>
The value of the export of the mineral amounted to 2.9 billion
U.S. dollars, and the total volume was 139.8 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Brazil is the second biggest iron ore producer and exporter in
the world, after Australia, which produces nearly 170 million tons
of iron ore every year.
</P>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO -- The excess of rain caused by the "El Nino"
phenomenon will cause a drop in the average yield of rice in the
1997-1998 harvest in the Southern Common Market (Mercosur)
countries, as forecast by agronomists.
</P>
<P>
The yield per hectare in Uruguay will drop to 6,235 kilograms
with husks, against the 6,600 kilograms of the previous harvest.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian yield per hectare is estimated at 2,700 kilograms
with husks, a drop of about 5 to 10 percent, as compared with the
previous agricultural cycle.
</P>
<P>
Argentina will have a situation similar to that of its
neighbors in the production of rice.
</P>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES -- The Argentine foreign debt surpassed for the
first time the 100 billion dollar level, with the foreign debt
totaling 101.101 billion dollars at the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
This amount means a 5.6 percent increase over the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO -- Brazilian leather exports doubled in the last
five years, from 386 million dollars in 1992, to 740 million
dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Italy, Portugal, Hong Kong, and the United States are the main
importers of Brazilian leather.
</P>
<P>
The sector registered a 569 million dollars surplus last year,
and it is foreseen that the sector surplus will reach one billion
dollars by the end of 2000.

<HEADLINE> Snake Bites Cause Many Deaths in Peruvian Jungle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Cases of person affected by snake
bites are everyday events in the indigenous jungle communities in
Peru's Amazonas province and many victims died for delayed
treatment.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports today quoted government officials as saying
that the situation was serious because many died for lack of
antidotes or immediate means of transportation to health centers
located in main cities of the province.
</P>
<P>
Every month, there occurr some 20 snake-biting cases. Governor
of Imaza District Hernan Senkuan Wajash told the local press that
"These are everyday events, but anyway we do not get support from
the sub-regional health office."
</P>
<P>
Zonal Health Center Director Bartolome Incash Shavit said
inhabitants of the Imaza district are mainly poor people and they
do not have enough money to get in-time treatment after they are
bitten by snakes.
</P>
<P>
The director said the inhabitants are frequently attacked by a
very dangerous kind of snakes called "Jergon," whose venom kills
80 percent of its victims. Rattlesnake is another killer for its
venom can cause death in minutes.
</P>
<P>
Incash Shavit asked health authorities to supply him with a
refrigerator to keep the antidotes and other medicines to treat
the patients. He also requested better logistical support.

<HEADLINE> Human Rights Official Assassinated in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- A Colombian human
rights affairs official was assassinated in downtown Antioquia in
northern Colombia, a report reaching here said Saturday.

organizations and some army units.
</P>
<P>

United Self-Defense Units of Cordoba and Uraba, was accused of
being responsible for several killings in the El Aro community.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Licensing in California Requires Legal Residency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 28 (Xinhua) -- California plans to become
the first U.S. state to require that all state-licensed workers
prove they are U.S. citizens or legal residents when renewing
their professional licenses, the Los Angeles Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
This means producing papers -- birth certificates or passports
for citizens, immigration documents for legal residents. Without
the paper, state licenses will be denied.
</P>
<P>
The plan affects more than 3 million people licensed to do
business in California -- from accountants and doctors to
cleaners. Some workers will have to start proving their status as
soon as August 1.
</P>
<P>
Officials say citizens with professional licenses will have to
prove their citizenship only once, and that the information then
will be added to the state database, while Legal residents will
have to prove their status each time when they renew their
licenses.
</P>
<P>
The rule was mandated by the 1996 federal overhaul of welfare
laws, but California would be the first state to implement the
requirement.
</P>
<P>
State officials revealed two reasons behind the implementation
of the plan in California -- a public debate over welfare reform
focused on how to move welfare recipients, particularly
U.S. citizens, into jobs in California, and nationwide, the
Congress seeks to deny "public benefits" to illegal immigrants.

<HEADLINE> Feature: A Sad Scene in Sanction-Hit Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Zaharaa Hani, a two-year-old
girl with a small and fragile body of only 8,000 grams, lies
helplessly in bed at the end of a corridor of Saddam Center
Children's Hospital in downtown Baghdad, the capital of Iraq which
has suffered years of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Hani's big black eyes are filled with despair and fear,
reminding everyone of the children dying in African refugee
camps. And only a person who has undergone all the sufferings of
the world could have that many wrinkles on the face.
</P>
<P>
Hani suffers from pneumonia, a curable disease. But four days
of high fever has put her in critical condition, because she is in
malnutrition and the hospital is short of common antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
Like Hani, hundreds of thousands of malnourished Iraqi children
are exhausting their lives in fighting a disease without the help
of immediate and adequate medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
"My emergency room treated 80 patients and hospitalized 24 of
them today," says Dr. Mazin Jassim, director of the emergency room
of the hospital.
</P>
<P>
Hani and her parents live in a two-bedroom apartment in a poor
neighborhood in New Baghdad in south Baghdad. Her father is a
jobless who sells vegetables. Like many other Iraqis, he makes
7,000 dinars (about five U.S. dollars) a month.
</P>
<P>
"What he makes is only about one tenth of what he made before
the sanctions," says Zahra Jumaa, Hani's mother. "The money is
even not enough to pay the rent. Where can we find good food for
our three children?"
</P>
<P>
More than seven years of U.N. trade embargo have thrown Iraq
into an economic depression. Food are rationed: 9 kgs of wheat
flour, 2.5 kgs of rice are what a man can get in a month. Mothers
with infants are allowed to get 270 grams of milk powder a
month. Meat is a luxury for most Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
Shortage in food has led to malnutrition, underweight and
reduced immunity of children, making them more prone to various
diseases. Moreover, the sanctions have exhausted the medicine
stocks of hospitals, making common and curable diseases the
biggest killer of Iraqi children.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jassim says that in his hospital, six to eight children die
each day of the shortage of antibiotics and common diagnostic
equipments.
</P>
<P>
According to latest statistics released by the Iraqi Health
Ministry, in January alone, 7,000 children under 5 left the world
they had just come to because of malnutrition and the shortage of
medicines. In contrast, only 389 children died in the same period
in 1989 before the sanctions. Iraqi health officials say that the
lack of medicines and equipments has paralyzed two thirds of the
hospitals in Iraq and left nearly one million children dead.
</P>
<P>
Saddam Center Children's Hospital is one of those remaining
open. In addition to the lack of medicines, Dr. Jassim says it has
to rely on out-sourcing for diagnostics because it has run out of
peripherals needed to keep its equipments functioning.
</P>
<P>
In a bed at the other end of the corridor, a 12-month-old boy
is trying to catch breath under an oxygen mask. "He is dying, but
we still cannot determine if he is suffering from encephalitis
because of the lack of brain imaging equipment," says Dr. Jassim.
</P>
<P>
In the infant ward, dozens of underweight babies are in
isolated glass capsules receiving treatment. Intisar Hamed, an
18-year-old mother putting her hand on a capsule by her bed, says
her daughter has been in the capsule for 20 days because she only
weighs 2,000 grams on birth. The mother says she had anemia when
she was pregnant.
</P>
<P>
"Now we have 40 underweight babies a day, four times than what
we had seven years ago," says Dr. Jassim.
</P>
<P>
In the cancer ward, about a dozen of children suffering from
leukemia are waiting for their deaths. No one can expect a
hospital even short of antibiotics to cure cancers. Dr. Jassim
worries that if this situation remains unchanged, more Iraqi
children will die.
</P>
<P>
Married in 1991, Jumaa and her husband have never been to
Kuwait nor seen any weapons of mass destruction. But they have
been suffering under sanctions for seven years without knowing why.
</P>
<P>
Jumaa, a housewife with primary school education, has neither
the authority to force U.N. Security Council to adopt a resolution
lifting the sanctions on her country nor the power to order the
aircraft carriers to go back to where they are from. All she can
do is to pray more times a day and more piously: "My God, save our
children."
</P>
<P>
Jumaa hopes the United Nations will lift the sanctions on Iraq
immediately, so that her children will grow up as healthy as those
in other parts of the world.

<HEADLINE> China to Revamp Energy Structure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- China will develop oil, natural
gas and renewables in a bid to revamp its current coal-dominated
energy structure, China Daily Business Weekly reported today.
</P>
<P>
"The lack of high-quality energy will be the main problem
facing China's future energy supply," Li Hongxun, deputy director
with the Transportation and Energy Department of the State
Planning Commission, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Coal now accounts for 75 percent of total energy production and
consumption in China. The percentage is expected to drop to 70 in
the next few years, said Li.
</P>
<P>
China has the world's fifth largest oil reserves. But oil
imports will be increased and exploration for domestic reserves be
accelerated to meet rising demand for clean energy, Business
Weekly said.
</P>
<P>
By raising the output and import of natural gas, the gas share
of China's energy supply is forecast to rise to 4 percent as
compared with the current 2 percent by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Renewable energy will also grow to more than 390 tons of coal
equivalent (tce) in 2010, the English paper said.
</P>
<P>
Energy demand will stand at 1.47 billion to 1.54 billion tce in
2010 and is expected to top 2 billion tce in the year 2010.

<HEADLINE> China's Investment Plan Targets Overseas Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- China's ambitious investment plan
provides a great opportunity for using foreign capital, according
to a State Planning Commission official.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is channeling foreign capital to
infrastructure, basic industries and export-oriented enterprises,
whereas the technical renovation of enterprises and the service
and trade sectors will gradually open up to foreign capital, He
Ju, deputy director of the SPC's Department of Foreign Capital
Utilization, was quoted as saying by the China Daily's Business
Weekly today.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign investors are encouraged to apply BOT and other
project financing methods in public infrastructure and basic
industries," He said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the arrangement of BOT, in which the government
authorizes investors to build a project and operate it for a
certain period before the ownership rights are transferred to the
government at zero cost, is still at the experimental stage in
China and its use is likely to be extended after the experience
has been reviewed.
</P>
<P>
SPC Minister Chen Jinhua announced early last year that China
will invest eight trillion yuan in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Bottlenecks in China's infrastructure and basic industries are
still holding back economic progress, and it is imperative that
China experiments with BOT to channel more foreign funds into
infrastructure projects, He said.
</P>
<P>
BOT, which was first experimented in China in 1995, has in
recent years become a popular way for developing countries to
raise money for infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
SPC statistics show that China's foreign capital utilization
amounted to 51 billion US dollars last year.

<HEADLINE> Plan for Tackling Taihu Lake Pollution Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- A plan for preventing and
treating water pollution in Taihu Lake, one of China's biggest
lakes, in east China's Jiangsu Province has been approved by the
State Council, the nation's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The plan is to be carried out before the end of the Ninth
Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000) and up to the year 2010. The
plan requires that all the factories in the Taihu Lake area meet
the government's discharge standards within this year; that all
the water in Taihu Lake be clean by 2000; and that the soundness
of the lake's ecological environment be guaranteed by the year
2010.
</P>
<P>
With a drainage area of 36,500 sq km and a population of
30 million, the Taihu Lake area is one of China's most
economically booming regions.
</P>
<P>
Since an on-the-spot meeting on treating pollution in the area
was held in April 1996, pollution treatment has been in full swing
there.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and other provinces and
municipalities around the lake have adopted plans for meeting the
discharge standards this year, and 1,035 key factories have been
identified in this regard.

<HEADLINE> Negotiations Between Central Government and 14th Dalai Lama (4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Years ago, the 14th Dalai Lama left no stone unturned to gain
the removal of a statue of a Buddhist guardian. This touched off
public discontent among Tibetans residing outside China. Many
asked: Since the 14th Dalai Lama styles himself to be the
"all-knowing Goddess of Mercy", for what reason is he against the
statue of a Buddhist guardian?
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, this was merely a political ploy, the
commentary said.
</P>
<P>
In March 1997, when the 14th Dalai Lama planned to visit
Taiwan, the Central Government managed to inform him of its stand
and principle and wished he give up contacts with "Taiwanese
independence" forces. But he turned a deaf ear to this advice, the
commentary said.
</P>
<P>
In previous contacts, the Central Government repeatedly
stressed that it was willing to negotiate so long as the 14th
Dalai Lama can genuinely relinquish his stand for "Tibetan
independence", stop working to split the motherland, publicly
state that Tibet is an inseparable part of China, and admit that
the Central Government of the People's Republic of China is the
sole legitimate government representative of the whole people of
China.
</P>
<P>
In response, the 14th Dalai Lama made proposals and suggestions
for the "settlement of the Tibetan issue". They include special
treatment as enjoyed by Hong Kong and Taiwan and establishment of
the so-called "great Tibet autonomous region" encompassing Tibet,
Sichuan, Qinghai, Gansu and Yunnan.
</P>
<P>
Recently, he also proposed "a high degree of autonomy" for
Tibet, which appears to be his way of showing that he has given up
the idea of independence, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
But a thorough study of the proposal shows that he has changed
his tactics by taking two, instead of one, steps toward "Tibetan
independence". As the first step, he strives to win "a high degree
of autonomy", to be followed by "Tibetan independence".

<TEXT>
<P>
This analysis is correct because the 14th Dalai Lama and his
clique have never given up their efforts to split the motherland.
In the 1960s and the 1970s, with the aid and support from
international anti-China forces, they conducted military
harassment in border areas. In the late 1980s, they incited riots
in Lhasa. In recent years, the 14th Dalai Lama traveled here and
there to preach the goal of "Tibetan independence".
</P>
<P>
But the 14th Dalai Lama has his own worries, the commentary
mentioned.
</P>
<P>
China enjoys a stable situation and rapid high economic
growth. Its international status has been enhanced and its
political influence expanded. It has improved its relations with
the United States; and some countries in the European Union have
readjusted their policies toward China. Under this situation, the
14th Dalai Lama worries that his interests will be neglected.
</P>
<P>
In addition, people in Tibet enjoy a better life, and most of
them yearn for prolonged stability. Hence, the Tibetan separatists
find it hard to incite riots to force the Central Government to
make further concessions.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Tibetans residing abroad are locked in an
increasingly sharpening conflict. While the 14th Dalai Lama wants
to tighten control of them, they fight to free themselves from his
control.
</P>
<P>
These developments force the 14th Dalai Lama to readjust his
policy. While he works to mislead public opinion, the public
opinion and his supporters mislead himself sometimes, the
commentary said.

MOSCOW, March 1 (Xinhua) -- In spite of many difficulties, the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) will exist, develop and
strengthen, a CIS top official said Saturday in St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
Yegor Stroyev, Chairman of the CIS Interparliamentary
Conference, made this remark at a news conference following a
council meeting of the conference, ITAR-TASS news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He added, forms of unification may alter along with the
changing situation, the CIS countries will have to rely on
advanced technologies and joint efforts to face and occupy a world
market of great competition.
</P>
<P>
After discussing 15 issues, participants called for a change to
the state of a lack of a unified strategy among the 64 inter-state
cooperation institutions in the CIS. They also urged for adoption
of laws that are binding on all CIS members in order to promote
their economic integration.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also decided to set up a working group to draft an
anti-terrorist convention.
</P>
<P>
With differing viewpoints on unification from other CIS
members, Ukraine, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan were absent from the
meeting.

<HEADLINE> Negotiations Between Central Government and 14th Dalai Lama (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1989 the 14th Dalai Lama was awarded the Nobel Peace
Prize. He misjudged the political situation then and began
predicting that China was highly likely to collapse after the
political turmoil in June 1989, like the Soviet Union, within
three to five years.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese Government was unstable, so there was
no need to negotiate with it then, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after the award ceremony, the 14th Dalai
Lama said, "My winning this prize is good for realization of an
independent Tibet," the commentary quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Against his expectations, China remains stable and enjoys
economic development. In view of this, the 14th Dalai Lama did
then propose resuming contacts with the Central Government.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua on the eve of the 40th anniversary
of the peaceful liberation of Tibet in May 1991, Chinese Premier
Li Peng painted a rosy picture when asked about the government's
future plans for the economic and social development of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
"In the future, the Central Government will, as always, seek
economic and cultural development in Tibet, adopt more policies to
improve the life of the Tibetans, continue to mobilize people of
all nationalities in China to aid Tibet, and give full support to
Tibet's effort to implement the Eighth Five-Year Plan and the
10-Year Development Program," Premier Li was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The State Council has earmarked one billion yuan over a
10-year period to undertake comprehensive development of the
Three-River Valley area in Tibet. The Yamzhog Yumco Pump Storage
Power Station, expansion of airports and roads, and some other
energy and communication projects have been listed as major state
projects. This is aimed at enabling Tibet to be like other parts
of China in building socialism with Chinese characteristics and
working for joint development," Li said.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the government had changed its policy toward
the 14th Dalai Lama, the premier said that it had always been
consistent and unchanged.

The result came as little surprise after the final and mostly

Dutchman Koos Morbrenhout and French rider Eddy Seigneur had

<HEADLINE> Hansen Highlights at Euro Indoors With New World Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Briton Ashia Hansen jumped into
the great as she set a new world record for women's triple jump
with 15.16 meters at the European Indoor Championships on Saturday
in Valencia, Spain.
</P>
<P>
Hansen, 26, bettered the previous best mark of 15.03 meters set
by Russian Yolanda Chen in Barcelona, Spain, in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"I still can't believe it," she said. "I knew it was a big jump
but when I got out of the pit I did not think it was that far."
</P>
<P>
World champion Sarka Kasparkova of the Czech Republic took
silver with an indoor national best of 14.76, while the bronze
went to Russian Yelena Lebedyenko with her fifth round in 14.32.
</P>
<P>
Hansen, whose only win came from the Grand Prix last summer,
plus a silver in a world indoor competition, set the world best in
the fourth attempt.
</P>
<P>
The victory swept off Hansen's series of disappointments in
world major competitions when the Briton constantly threatened the
world record but eventually failed every time.
</P>
<P>
In the women's 60 meters, Germany's Melanie Paschke won the
gold medal in 7.14 seconds, with France's Frederique Bangue second
in 7.18 and countryfellow Odiah Sidibe third in 7.22.
</P>
<P>
Agelos Pavlakikis of Greece walked away with the men's 60-meter
gold in 6.55 seconds, followed by Britain's Jason Gardener with
6.59 and France's Stephane Cali finishing third in 6.60.
</P>
<P>
Pavlakikis is the first ever Greek male sprinter to win at the
European indoor championships.
</P>
<P>
Russian's Irina Korzhanenko beat reigning world indoor champion
Vita Pavlysh of the Ukraine with a personal best of 20.25 meters
in the final round of the women's shot contest, while the
Ukrainian had to settle for the silver with 20.00.
</P>
<P>
Corrie de Bruim of the Netherlands got the bronze medal with
18.97, a national indoor record.

change his stand for 'Tibetan independence'. Everything is
negotiable except for 'Tibetan independence'," Li said.
</P>
<P>
The Central Government ventured to contact private delegates of
the 14th Dalai Lama ever since the advent of the 1980s, and strove
to contact him again in 1992 and 1993, but he unilaterally
suspended further contacts on the excuse that the Central
Government held a rigid attitude.
</P>
<P>
On April 29, 1994, the People's Daily carried a statement made
by a spokesman with the CPC United Front Work Department during an
interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides failed to reach agreement on the fact that 'Tibet
is an inseparable part of China'. The 14th Dalai Lama called this
fundamental principle a 'precondition and obstacle to
negotiations'," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"This fundamental principle is by no means either a
precondition or an obstacle. On the contrary, it is the basis for
negotiations and the surest guarantee for their success. This is
what the 14th Dalai Lama calls the 'rigid attitude' of the Central
Government," he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the reincarnation procedures for the late 10th Panchen
Erdeni entered its decisive stage after efforts made in the
previous six years. At the time when lamas with the Tashilhungpo
Monastery were considering the located soul boy candidates, the
14th Dalai Lama suddenly announced in India that a Tibetan child
was the reincarnated soul boy, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
He did so to oppose the Central Government, which enjoys the
highest authority in confirming the soul boy. As a self-styled
religious leader, however, the 14th Dalai Lama defied religious
rituals needed for confirmation of a soul boy as well as
historical precedence. He did so to serve his political aim of
splitting the motherland.

<HEADLINE> Sampras Advances into Philadelphia Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Pete
Sampras advanced into the final by beating sixth-seeded German
Tommy Haas, 6-4, 6-4, on Saturday at the 589,250 U.S. dollars
Advanta Championships in Philadelphia, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Top seed Sampras, who was in his second ATP Tour final of the
month, is seeking his fourth title at this event and his 53rd
career ATP Tour crown.
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old American tennis star was broken in the second
game of the first set and fell behind, 1-4.
</P>
<P>
The world number one tennis player broke back in the seventh
game and again in the ninth game as Haas double-faulted on break
point before he took the set on an ace.
</P>
<P>
Sampras then broke in the seventh game in the second on a
spectacular backhand crosscourt winner, and then closed out the
match on a forehand volley down the line, improving to 12-2 this
season.
</P>
<P>
He will take on the winner of Saturday night's second semifinal
between third seed Thomas Enqvist of Sweden, the 1995 champion,
and Canadian qualifier Sebastien Lareau.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, a three-time champion, earned his first professional
title here in 1990 and won again in 1992.
</P>
<P>
He edged U.S. Open champion Patrick Rafter of Australian last
year here to pocket the trophy of the event for the third time.
</P>
<P>
Sampras has barely retained the top ranking in men's tennis the
last two weeks, although he has not won a tournament this season.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Frenchman Cedric Pioline
advanced into the final of the London indoor tennis tournament
with a 6-3, 7-6 victory over Jan Siemerink of the Netherlands on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Pioline, 28, now faces a showdown with third-seeded Russian
Yevgeny Kafelnikov on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a tough match but if I serve like this I have
a good chance," Pioline said.
</P>
<P>
The Frenchman never lost his serve, taking the first set
confidently with a break in the eighth game.
</P>
<P>
In the second set the Dutch Siemerink lost his concentration
and the unforced errors piled up - particularly when he attacked
the net.
</P>
<P>
He came under pressure on his serve at 2-2 but held on with two
big serves and a volley to save the game.
</P>
<P>
Both players then held serve easily despite two double faults
from Pioline at 5-6.
</P>
<P>
In the tiebreak only one point went against serve but that was
all Pioline needed to close the match.
</P>
<P>
In the first semifinal of the day Kafelnikov beat South African
Wayne Ferreira two sets to love.

BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Highlights of today's major
Beijing-based Newspapers:
</P>
<P>
All major newspapers reported the closing of 30th meeting of
the Standing Committee of the Eighth National People's Congress,
which confirmed the qualifications of the 2,979 deputies to the
Ninth National People's Congress, which is to open its first
session on March 5.
</P>
<P>
 "People's Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress has
approved the issuing of 270 billion yuan in special treasury bonds
to raise funds to replenish capital of the solely State-owned
commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
-- A memorial hall for the late Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai and
his wife, Deng Yingchao, was opened Saturday in north China's port
city of Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
"China Youth Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- China's higher learning institutions will enroll 1.08 million
students this year, up 6.9 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
"Beijing Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- Starting today an automatic monitoring system equipped with
advanced computer-based graphic technology has been used in most
of the road crosses of the Chinese capital to curb traffic rule
violations. The system can "seal and memorize" dozens of images
per second.
</P>
<P>
 "Xinhua Daily Telegraph"
</P>
<P>
-- China's special economic zones, including Shenzhen, Zhuhai,
Shantou, Xiamen, Shanghai's Pudong and the island province of
Hainan, have over the last five years continued their lead in
reforming the economic system and economic operations.
</P>
<P>
 "China Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- China will develop oil, natural gas and renewable energy in
a bid to revamp its current inefficient coal-dominated energy
structure. Coal currently accounts for 75 percent of China's total
energy production and consumption.
</P>
<P>
-- The financial crisis in East and Southeast Asia has pushed
China to a critical turning point in overhauling its foreign
investment structure. Zhou Shijian, Vice President of China
Chamber of Commerce of Metal, Mineral and Chemical Importers and
Exporters, said that China should shift its focus for attracting
foreign investment more from Asian sources to developed Western
countries.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, the Republic of Korea and Southeast Asian countries
supply nearly 70 percent of China's foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
-- China's imports of automobiles declined sharply last year as
domestic car makers expanded production and tariff reductions cut
profit margins. In the first nine months of 1997, China imported
32,624 motor vehicles and if the trend continued in the fourth
quarter, imports for the whole year would be 47.1 percent down
from 1996.

<HEADLINE> FIFA Warns England Over Ticket Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- English complaints about the
number of tickets they have received for this year's World Cup
could ruin their chances of hosting the cup in 2006, a FIFA
spokesman was quoted on Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Mail quoted world soccer body FIFA's spokesman Keith
Cooper as saying it was dismayed that threats had emerged of crowd
violence at the World Cup unless more tickets were made available
to English fans.
</P>
<P>
"The longer England keep protesting about the ticket allocation
for their fans this summer, the more they tighten the noose around
the neck of their application for 2006," Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
The FIFA spokesman said it was common for World Cup host
countries to keep the lion's share of tickets.
</P>
<P>
"It is a generally acknowledged part of the host nation's
package of privileges is that it has first claim on a majority of
the seats," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The Spanish are among several European countries who would
also have liked more tickets. But their fans are not saying they
will set fire to Paris in frustration," he added.
</P>
<P>
Several European countries, with England, the Netherlands and
Belgium at the forefront, have protested about the number of
tickets their fans have been allocated for the World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
The English Football Association (F.A.) said on Thursday it was
appealing to FIFA to intervene to settle the row.
</P>
<P>
Cooper also singled out British politicians, accusing them of
seeking to make capital out of the disagreement over tickets
because of the current popularity of soccer in Britain.
</P>
<P>
"Where were these politicians when football was in trouble a
few years ago? I'll tell you. They were running away from the game
as fast as they could go.
</P>
<P>
"Now football is fashionable and successful once more, they are
jumping on the bandwagon as a short cut to the populist vote,"
Cooper added.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Mail said there was "gung ho talk" in England of
sanctions to force the release of more tickets for the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
The daily said European dissent would strengthen support for
South Africa being awarded the 2006 competition.
</P>
<P>
Cooper said it was acknowledged that host countries of World
Cup tournaments had first claim on the majority of tickets.
</P>
<P>
"It is not proper to go back on that simply because these
finals are in Western Europe. Are England saying they would give
up thousands of extra tickets to the French, Dutch, Germans and
Italians if they were to be awarded 2006?"
</P>
<P>
"We think not," Cooper said.

<HEADLINE> Negotiations Between Central Government and 14th Dalai Lama (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Dalai Lama has never sought
genuine talks with the Central Government of China over the last
10 years, an article appeared on the latest issue of China's Tibet
said.
</P>
<P>
The 14th Dalai Lama suspended his contact with the Central
Government when he thought the international situation was in his
favor whereas demand negotiations when he thought the situation
was moving against him, the bimonthly journal commented recently.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest edition of China's Tibet, the 14th
Dalai Lama publicly repeated that he wants to negotiate during his
meetings with overseas media and statesmen lately. However, the
commentary said, he failed to reveal his stand and viewpoints to
the Central Government.
</P>
<P>
In his state visit to the United States last November, Chinese
President Jiang Zemin said, "The Central Government is willing to
negotiate with the Dalai Lama so long as he can genuinely
relinquish his stand for 'Tibetan independence', stop working to
split the motherland, publicly state that Tibet is an inseparable
part of China, and admit that the Central Government of the
People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate representative
of the whole people of China."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Central Government has negotiated with the 14th
Dalai Lama since 1979. The commentary focused on their contacts in
recent ten years after 1989.
</P>
<P>
When the 10th Panchen Erdeni died of a heart attack on January
28, 1989, the Buddhist Association of China (BAC) wrote to the
14th Dalai Lama inviting him to return for the memorial
activities. In addition, BAC President Zhao Puchu personally
delivered the letter to the 14th Dalai Lama's private
representative and sincerely invited him to come back.
</P>
<P>
But the 14th Dalai Lama refused the invitation. "If the 14th
Dalai Lama had any intention to contact the Central Government,
this was a perfect opportunity," the magazine commented.

<P>
LOME, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Two early goals helped Egypt to
beat defending champions South Africa 2-0 and win the African
Nations Cup in Ouagadougou on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The victory smashed South African's dream to a fourth title in
the tournament.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Hassan struck after just five minutes and Tarek Mostafa
scored eight minutes later after a quickly taken free kick.
</P>
<P>
The two goals effectively killed the tournament's showpiece as
Egypt's defence competently held out against South African's weak
attack.
</P>
<P>
Egypt last won the trophy 12 years ago, but their victory on
Saturday saw them equal Ghana's record of four tournament triumphs.
</P>
<P>
"We lost fair and square," said Jomo Sono, coach of the World
Cup qualifiers South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"I was given no chance of reaching the final. I reached the
final. I'm happy, I'm finished now. I have done my part."
</P>
<P>
He now hands over the team to Frenchman Philippe Troussier who
coached Burkino Faso through this competition but will guide South
Africa's fortunes in their first World Cup finals in France.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian coach Mahmoud el-Gohari became the first person to win
the continent's top trophy as both a player and coach. Al-Gohari,
60, was in Egypt's winning team in 1959 when he was leading
goalscorer.

BONN -- Voters at the western German state of Lower Saxony will
face a vital choice at local elections on Sunday, because the
outcome will help the country's main opposition Social Democratic
Party (SPD) to nominate its candidate to challenge Chancellor
Helmut Kohl in the national elections in September.
</P>
<P>
The Lower Saxony state vote will put Gerhard Schroeder, one of
the two possible SPD chancellor candidates, against Christian
Wulff of Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party, who will
try to prevent Schroeder from winning a third term as the Lower
Saxony state premier. (Germany-Local Election)

MADRID, February 28 (Xinhua) -- World record holder Wilson
Kipketer said on Saturday he had to be cautious for his return to
the track after his recovery from malaria.
</P>
<P>
"I have to be very careful or I might lose the whole season,"

might have to wait until the final grand prix before returning to
competition."
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old Kenyan-born Dane told a news conference in
Valencia, Spain, that he was unsure of the date of his coming-back.
</P>

"I'm going to leave it until the last minute," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kipketer, who was at the European indoor championships to
promote a new sponsors' contract, had malaria on a Christmas visit
in Kenya and was hospitalized a week in Portugal last month.

<HEADLINE> Concert for Late Chinese Premier held in New York </HEADLINE>

<P>
NEW YORK, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger said he has enormous respect and much
affection for late Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai (March 5, 1898 -
January 8, 1976).
</P>
<P>
In a message to a concert held in Carnegie Hall, New York, on
Saturday to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Zhou's birth,
Kissinger said Zhou "recognized that the mutual interest of both
China and the United States would best be served by seeking the
paths of cooperation".
</P>
<P>
Kissinger, who traveled to China in 1971 in preparation for
former U.S. President Richard Nixon's visit to open up ties
between the U.S. and China, said the concert "also celebrates the
ties of friendship that are the legacy of Zhou Enlai".
</P>
<P>
Kissinger, currently on a long-planned trip outside the U.S.
which kept him from joining the event featuring the performance of
a number of Chinese and U.S. artists, praised Zhou as "one of the
most significant figures of this century".
</P>
<P>
About 300 people from both Chinese and U.S. communities, among
them well-known U.S. actor, writer and producer Ossie Davis,
attended the two-hour concert.
</P>
<P>
The event was organized by U.S.-China People's Friendship
Association-New York Chapter, Foundation for U.S.-China Relations,
and the New York Association for the Peaceful Unification of
China.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Lifts Arms Embargo on South Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa on Saturday
announced in a joint statement the lifting of a 35-year-old U.S.
arms embargo on South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"The suspension of debarment opens the door for normalized
defense trade between the U.S. and South Africa," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement by Gore and Mbeki came after a seven-day visit
by U.S. government arms experts to South Africa. They concluded
that South African defense firms were complying with U.S. trade
regulations, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The arms experts reviewed the dealings of Armaments
Corporation of South Africa (Armscor), Fuchs Electronics and
Denel and its divisions, including Kentron.
</P>
<P>
In a plea agreement last year with the U.S. District Court in
Philadelphia, Armscor, Kentron and Fuchs agreed to pay fines
totaling 12.5 million U.S dollars for their involvement in a
massive international arms smuggling operation for South Africa's
apartheid-era government.
</P>
<P>
The companies were accused of buying sophisticated military
equipment from International Signal and Control Corp. of
Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and sending it to South Africa from 1978
to 1989 in violation of the U.S. and U.N. arms embargo.
</P>
<P>
The case posed a diplomatic dilemma for Washington because
the White-minority government that established the companies was
no longer in power.
</P>
<P>
Gore and Mbeki have been working to resolve the conflict
since July 1996.

<HEADLINE> Federal Investigators Probing Kickbacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Federal investigators are
probing more than two dozen mail-order firms and pharmacies that
allegedly traded kickbacks for patient referrals in Medicare --
the federal health insurance program.
</P>
<P>
Dallas-based U.S. Attorney Paul Coggins is investigating
companies nationwide that specialize in mail-order drug sales to
senior citizens, The Dallas Morning News reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that investigators have not disclosed their
targets, but the companies involved might have to pay 20 million
dollars to settle potential lawsuits by Coggins' office.
</P>
<P>
Federal investigators so far are handling the matter through
civil-court procedures, the report said. They do not rule out the
possibility of filing criminal charges, however, either in Dallas
or elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Some pharmacies that engaged in the kickbacks characterized
them as lawfully made under marketing and sales contracts.
</P>
<P>
Federal investigators say the kickbacks stem from a larger
problem: Medicare pays nine times what doctors and pharmacies do
for the few medicines it covers.
