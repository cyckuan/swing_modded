   In a remarkable bit of long-distance theater, Sammy Sosa and
Mark McGwire exchanged home runs 45 minutes apart Friday night,
enhancing a home run duel that had already captivated the attention
of fans and nonfans everywhere. Sosa, who had led McGwire in their
dash to major-league baseball's home run record only once this
season, slugged his 66th home run in the fourth inning of the
Chicago Cubs' game in Houston. Then in the fifth inning in St.
Louis, McGwire countered by slamming his 66th against the Montreal
Expos.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's version of hand-to-hand combat came at the start of
the final weekend of the regular season. The final three-game
series were also critical for teams fighting for the final playoff
spots. The most heated of those races involved the Cubs, the Mets,
who were playing in Atlanta, and the San Francisco Giants, who were
playing the Colorado Rockies in Denver. The winner of that race
will gain the wild card, or fourth and final, spot in the National
League playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves edged the Mets, 6-5, and the Astros defeated the
Cubs, 6-2, maintaining their tie for the wild-card lead.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's home run tied the Cubs' game with the Astros, 2-2, but it
untied his personal duel with McGwire and broke the existing home
run record. McGwire on Sept. 8 broke the record of 61 Roger Maris
set in 1961 with the Yankees, when he eclipsed Babe Ruth's 60 in
1927. McGwire continued to hold his lead over Sosa until Sosa hit
his 64th and 65th last Wednesday in Milwaukee. Those blows made the
pair the running record-holders.
</P>
<P>
   Both players have said repeatedly that they would not mind if
the other finished with more home runs, but they also have said
that they would love to see themselves end the season in a tie.
``What he and I have done,'' McGwire said after his game,
``whoever's on top, nobody should be disappointed. Two guys have
done something that's never been done before, so how can you walk
away disappointed if you're one below or one above. Whatever
happens at the last out of the game Sunday, how can you think about
walking in here with your head down.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa struck first Friday night. Batting for the second time in
the game against his fellow Dominican and good friend, Jose Lima,
Sosa drove the second pitch an estimated 462 feet into fourth level
of the left-field stands at the Astrodome. He hit his 50th and 51st
home runs against Lima at Wrigley Field in Chicago on Aug. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Four days earlier at Wrigley, Sosa and McGwire went into a game
between the Cubs and the Cardinals tied with 47 home runs each.
Sosa, who had never led McGwire, whacked his 48th in the fifth
inning. But in the eighth inning, only 57 minutes later, McGwire
swatted his 48th, and then in the 10th he hit another home run,
snatching the lead once again.
</P>
<P>
   This time McGwire waited only 45 minutes. Batting simultaneously
with Sosa, who hit a grounder to shortstop, McGwire, who had not
hit a home run since last Sunday, first hit a high fly toward the
left-field stands that just veered foul. He took the second pitch
from Shayne Bennett, a 26-year-old rookie from Australia, for a
ball, then swung and missed for a second strike.
</P>
<P>
   After fouling off another pitch, McGwire swung and, as Sosa had
with his earlier shot, instantly knew the ball was headed where no
outfielder could catch the ball. It descended into the left-field
stands an estimated 375 feet from where McGwire watched.
</P>
<P>
   The Astrodome crowd of 51,831, whose Astros have won the NL
Central championship, witnessed the McGwire home run on the
stadium's giant video screens and cheered, just as they had roared
for Sosa in calling him out of the visiting dugout for a curtain
call.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The home run race has created a new phenomenon in baseball: home
fans cheering for and saluting visiting players whose home runs
could help beat the home team. Home fans have also taken to booing
their own teams' pitchers if they walk Sosa and McGwire, or even
throw them pitches that are out of the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire had his next turn at bat before Sosa had his, and he
lined a single on the first pitch to left field. Sosa went to the
plate as the leadoff batter in the ninth inning of a game the Cubs
were losing, 6-2. Chicago's share of the wild-card lead was at
stake, but Sosa was unable to reduce his team's deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Facing Billy Wagner, the Astros' flame-throwing closer, he took
two pitches for balls, then swung at and missed two pitches. The
fifth pitch was also a strike, and Sosa took it for the third
strike, maintaining his unwelcome position of never having ended a
day this season leading McGwire.

MCGWIRE ANSWERS SOSA IN THE HOME RUN RACE

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The catch-me-if-you can home run race that has
stirred the nation required a split-screen to capture Friday night
as Mark McGwire of the Cardinals sent a 375-foot home run into the
left-field stands here 45 minutes after Sammy Sosa of the Cubs had
broken a homer tie with his 66th in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   A moment after Sosa grounded out in the at-bat that followed his
fourth-inning blast in Houston, McGwire tore into a 1-2 pitch by
Montreal's Shayne Bennett and sent the sellout crowd at Busch
Stadium into a frenzy in the fifth against the Expos.
</P>
<P>
   The red-clad fans, decked out in their McGwire wear, could
breathe again. The sight of a hand reaching out of the shadows and
pulling down No. 66 off the center-field scoreboard for Sosa had
sent a nervous stir through the fans. Instantly, they knew their
beloved icon had been passed by Sosa in a home run race that has
one last glorious weekend left.
</P>
<P>
   During the chase, McGwire has always met Sosa's challenge when
tied for the home run lead. Before Friday night, the most visible
evidence of this came on Aug. 19, when the two drew the nation's
undivided attention while playing against each other. Early in that
game, Sosa nudged ahead of McGwire by hitting his 48th. McGwire
then delivered a quick reply by hitting his 48th and 49th.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that Sosa brings out the muscle in McGwire, although
neither man claims to be in a race with the other. Before Friday's
game, McGwire sounded more philosophical than competitive about
closing out his unforgettable season this weekend. McGwire
telephoned his 10-year-old son Friday morning at his home in
California, and had a normal father-son conversation, a little
about baseball, a little about school.
</P>
<P>
   But the youngster who was hugged in half by his joyous father on
Sept. 8, the moment McGwire crossed the plate after breaking Roger
Maris' legendary record, will not be able to make a Busch Stadium
appearance when his dad's part in baseball's feel-good drama closes
on Sunday. Matt's team is playing baseball, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got things to do,'' McGwire said Friday. ``I'm not going
to take anything away from him being a child.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no home run request by Matt. ``He didn't talk about
that,'' McGwire said. ``I asked him what he wanted me to do
tonight. And all he said was, `Have fun.' And that's exactly what
I'm going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never over until the last out, my last at-bat and Sammy's
last at-bat,'' McGwire added. ``We'll be playing at the same time
this weekend. And I wish him luck. I just want everyone to have
fun. So let's have fun.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There is something to be said for perspective. That is one thing
McGwire has gained in what he called ``the most mentally grueling
season of my life.'' But somewhere along this mind-wrenching chase,
McGwire fixed his Windex-blue eyes on those around him and
discovered the pied piper effect of his marvelous journey with
Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago, he really took notice of how the country was
taking a coffee break from its troubles and following the magic
McGwire and Sosa were making.
</P>
<P>
   People were feeling good, and others were deeply touched by this
entrancing spectacle. McGwire could see this when a network news
broadcast led with the home run race before the grim details of
politics. He could see it when he sifted through the emotional
notes and letters to him, penned in ink and crayon, from old and
young.
</P>
<P>
   And he could hear it when a divorced father, like McGwire,
walked up to him and thanked him for being an inspiration, for
showing the country how a man and his ex-wife could amicably raise
a son. So it struck McGwire: This pursuit was not about the final
number, but the amount of impact he and Sosa have had on the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That hits harder than any number,'' McGwire said before the
game Friday night. ``Whatever way the season ends, so be it. I'm
pretty damn proud of what I've done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a tie would be fantastic, but if I'm ahead or if he's
ahead, just look at what we've done. People have been saying for 37
years that this couldn't be done, and yet two guys have done it.
What I'll take away from this is the impact I've had on people's
lives. It's amazing that a guy who swings a bat can affect the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   But the season has not changed McGwire all that much. He has
sought more solitude, but the core of this regular guy still seems
to be the same. Whether or not his life will ever be normal again
remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pray it does,'' McGwire said. ``I am a normal person who
plays sports. I really hope people allow me to be who I am. People
have slowly changed around me, wanting to touch me, acting
differently. I'm asking that they not look at us differently. Sammy
and I go to the grocery store and take care of our children like
everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   And hit matching homers that thrill a nation.

 SOSA SWATS 66th BUT CUBS (AND METS) FAIL AGAIN

<P>
   HOUSTON _ Dewey defeats Truman. David knocks out Goliath. Sosa
beats McGwire? The underdog scenario has had two hours of life
during the Great Home Run Race of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   For an hour on Aug. 19, the lead was held by Sammy Sosa of the
Chicago Cubs, 48 home runs to 47. Only three innings after Sosa had
hit No. 48 against St. Louis, Mark McGwire tied him at 48, and then
hit another in the same game, going ahead by 49-48.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night it happened again. Playing in Houston, Sosa hit his
66th home run, a long shot into the fourth level of the indoor
Astrodome. Fans in St. Louis groaned when Sosa's homer was posted
on the scoreboard. About 45 minutes later, in Busch Stadium,
McGwire tied the race with his 66th, against the Montreal Expos,
prompting fireworks in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   And another underdog, the San Francisco Giants, was flexing its
muscles Friday night on the last weekend of a magical baseball
season. The day began with the Mets and Cubs tied for the lead in
the consolation race for the last spot in the National League
playoffs, while the Giants trailed by only one game.
</P>
<P>
   The day ended with the Mets and Cubs tied, after both lost to
the teams that lead them by many lengths in the divisional races.
The Cubs lost to the Astros, 6-2. The Mets lost to the Braves in
Atlanta, 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   In Denver, the Giants were playing a late game against the
Rockies. If the Giants won, the three teams would be tied in the
wild-card race, each with only two games to play.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's solo home run in Houston tied the Cubs, 2-2, in the
fourth inning of their game with the Astros. The Cubs would not
score again. The Astros went ahead in the bottom of the inning on a
run-scoring single by Moises Alou, and added single runs in each of
the next three innings. Jose Lima (16-8) defeated Kevin Tapani
(19-9), as the Cubs could manage only five hits.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa hit the home run off Lima, his longtime friend and fellow
Dominican. After Lima gave up two home runs (Nos. 50 and 51) to
Sosa on Aug. 23 in Chicago, both players reacted angrily to a
Chicago newspaper article suggesting that Lima might have been
trying to give Sosa a break. They were quick to point out that Lima
also gave up a home run to McGwire, on June 17 in the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been out with him lately,'' Sosa said before Friday
night's game. ``Everybody knows we're friends. It doesn't mean he's
going to give me anything to hit right there.'' And he reminded
reporters: Remember, fellas, this isn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   The pitch Sosa hit was right there. It landed an estimated 462
feet away, in the loge level, not among the 10 longest home runs
ever in the Astrodome, but impressive nonetheless. In his first
at-bat, Sosa had flied out to first base. He later grounded out,
then struck out in his final at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   The 51,831 Astros fans (with a few Cubs fans mixed in) called
Sosa out for a curtain call, and also gave a cheer for McGwire when
his home run was shown on the giant video screens. Each time Sosa
batted, thousands of flashbulbs were wasted.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sosa and McGwire were tied at 55 home runs after 138 games, tied
at 62, tied at 63, tied at 65, and are now tied at 66. Each has two
games remaining, Saturday and Sunday. From this homers-per-game
point of view, Sosa has never held the lead with the same amount of
the season played. At both points in which he led McGwire in home
runs, Sosa's team had played more games than McGwire's.
</P>
<P>
   Scoreboard watching was in vogue Friday night in Houston and
Atlanta. As the Cubs-Astros game began, the scoreboard already
showed the Mets losing, 2-0, in Atlanta. As the Cubs pulled to 2-1,
so did the Mets. When the Mets pulled even at 2-2, Sosa's homer did
the same for the Cubs. Then both the Mets and Cubs fell behind.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs players and coaches claimed to be fully recovered from
Wednesday's heartbreaking loss in Milwaukee, when left-fielder
Brant Brown's dropped fly ball allowed three runs to score and the
Brewers to win. The Cubs had blown a 7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs fans might not be so fully recovered. Agonizing through
another tantalizing year in a bad century, Cubs fans have been
gathering for therapy on the Internet, posting messages on a
bulletin board, not a Web page but a Usenet newsgroup, that serves
as a sort of 12-step program for Cubsaholics Anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   The bulletin board overflowed with angst after Brown's three-run
error, which cost the Cubs a chance to pull ahead of the Mets. Here
is a sampler of subject lines from messages posted in
alt.sports.baseball.chicago-cubs within hours of Brown's error:
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a nightmare.'' ``Dear God:'' ``I just wanna cry.''
``I'll be getting back to my real life now...'' ``Ouch!''
``NOOOOOOO!!!!!!'' ``The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul.'' ``Oh the
pain!!!!!!!!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Stick a fork in them ...'' ``Do a Hillary and stand by the
Cubbies.'' ``poof!!!!!!!!!!'' ``Bring me the head of Brant Brown.''
``In defense of Brant Brown.'' ``Hath God any mercy?'' ``The
Giants? Say it ain't so!''
</P>
<P>
   At Friday night's game in Houston, the early entertainment was
provided by Brown's encounter with a pigeon in left field. Brown
had started the game, perhaps as a grant of grace from manager Jim
Riggleman. During the second inning, the pigeon tried to land on
his head. He chased it, but it lingered. Brown threw his cap at it,
and umpires stopped the game until the pigeon retreated.

KILLER DAD GETS 21 TO LIFE FOR TODDLER'S 1995 MURDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PETER HARTLAUB  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- David Helms was sentenced to 21 years to life for
killing his 2-year-old son, in an apparent finish to a dramatic
case that turned mother against son and led to changes in
California's child-abuse laws.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the legal odyssey, Helms' former girlfriend was
jailed but later released and testified against him. The hourlong
hearing Friday included a statement by Helms' mother, Gail, urging
that her son receive the maximum sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully this is the end of a very terrible saga,'' Superior
Court Judge Sandy Kriegler said after handing down the maximum
punishment allowed by law.
</P>
<P>
   Helms was convicted of second-degree murder and assault on a
child causing death -- a crime that now can lead to a
25-years-to-life sentence because of changes the state Legislature
made in part because of the toddler's death.
</P>
<P>
   Finding that Lance Helms was ``particularly vulnerable'' and
that his father abused his ``position of trust,'' Kriegler
sentenced Helms to 15 years to life in prison for the slaying,
adding six years for a separate child-abuse charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no words a court can come up with to conclude a case
like this,'' Kriegler said.
</P>
<P>
   Helms kept a poker face during the hearing, which included a
montage of videotapes shot by Lance's grandmother before the child
died. Helms left the Van Nuys courtroom without looking back at an
audience filled with his mother, her friends and other relatives
who had gathered for the final stage in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Outside court, Gail Helms said she will probably never forgive
her son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still look at David and it hurts. It hurts a great deal,''
she said. ``But it's justice, and we needed that.''
</P>
<P>
   Helms watched the videotape intently, and his mother was
convinced her son was moved by the sight of her grandson playing
during bath time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He couldn't help but smile a little,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Helms was beaten to death in April 1995 in the suburban
North Hollywood apartment his father shared with a girlfriend, Eve
Wingfield.
</P>
<P>
   Wingfield initially was charged with the crime, pleaded guilty
to child abuse with the allegation of great bodily injury or death
and started to serve a 10-year prison term.
</P>
<P>
   But she was freed after a medical examiner found new evidence
re-estimating the time of death in the case, which pointed to
Helms, not Wingfield, as the only person who could have been
responsible for the fatal beating.
</P>
<P>
   She pleaded guilty against her lawyer's advice to a lesser
child-abuse charge and was released from prison. Wingfield, who did
not attend Helms' sentencing, testified against him during his
murder trial. A jury found him guilty Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Helms helped her daughter-in-law fight for custody of Lance
before he was killed, and has pushed for her son's prosecution
since her grandchild was beaten to death more than three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   County welfare officials had taken the boy away from his father
on a previous occasion, but then returned him.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Gail Helms said she kept faith that her son
would be punished for his crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still believed in the system, don't ask me why,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Helms' attorney, Jack Stone, filed a notice of appeal on behalf
of his client at the end of the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was terribly emotionally involved at the end because I was
convinced that legally there was not enough evidence to convict
him,'' Stone said outside court.
</P>
<P>
   A medical examiner testified during trial that Lance Helms died
immediately after a severe blow that split his liver. He said the
injuries were so massive that it was ``like being hit by a car.''

SOSA OUT FRONT BRIEFLY WITH ASTRODOME LAUNCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ No matter how fast he speeds down Route 66 toward the
home-run finish line, Sosa Testarosa can't seem to pass the Big Mac
truck.
</P>
<P>
   After drafting behind St. Louis Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire
for 159 games, Chicago Cubs outfielder Sammy Sosa finally nosed
ahead last night by hitting historic homer No. 66 early in his
team's 6-2 loss to the Houston Astros at the Astrodome. Just 45
minutes later, however, McGwire matched the feat by hammering his
66th in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a feeling he would hit one; he's been doing it all
year,'' Sosa said. ``It's frustrating to lose the game, but not to
be tied with him. It's great. It was nice to have the lead, even
for a little while.''
</P>
<P>
   Down to approximately their last 10 at-bats, McGwire and Sosa
fittingly take their Greater Tater Race toward the most glamorous
record in American sports into the season's final two days. The
Cubs, too _ their loss coupled with a loss by the New York Mets _
will have their playoff fate decided today and tomorrow as they
enter the weekend in a wild-card dead heat at 88-72. A victory by
San Francisco last night would make it a three-way tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't ask for much more tension all around,'' Cubs
first baseman Mark Grace said. ``But, geez, we need to win a
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, who launched a 462-foot rocket off Jose Lima in the fourth
inning, has led McGwire only twice _ for three innings on Aug. 19
and for two more last night. Shortly after Sosa grounded out in the
sixth, McGwire's tying homer was shown to the near-sellout crowd of
51,831. As they did after Sosa's shot, the Astrodome rose in a
standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Leading off the fourth, Sosa took a first-pitch fastball at the
knees for a strike from co-Dominican Republic native Lima. With the
identical 0-1 pitch, Sosa went where no player in major-league
history had gone before by crushing No. 66 into left-center field's
fourth level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew at contact she was gone,'' said Sosa, who hit his third
this season off good friend Lima. ``And it went a long way, huh?''
</P>
<P>
   After snaring No. 66 off a carom with one hand and falling over
a chair, the fan who nabbed the historic and specially marked ball
left the stadium with the ball without giving his name to
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   As has become his trademark during his likely MVP season, Sosa
stutter-stepped around the bases, signaled love to his mother,
Lucretia, and then doused his face with a cup of water while flash
bulbs lit the dome, fans buzzed and Sosa eventually emerged from
the dugout for a curtain call.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredible what he does,'' said Lima, who scoffed at the
suggestion he grooved pitches for his friend and countryman. ``You
make a mistake and boom, it's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa may be hotter, with three homers in his last two games and
a 56-41 edge since May 24, but McGwire has proven flawlessly
resilient with homers in at-bats immediately after Sosa twice
taking the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being admittedly distracted by the devastation of
Hurricane Georges in his Dominican Republic homeland, Sosa laughed
and joked with teammates, media and fans before the game. As
admirers screamed ``Sammmmmeeeeee'' relentlessly, Sosa hit homers
on six of 22 swings in batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   He was jammed by a 1-1 fastball in the first, popping weakly to
second. In the sixth, he tried to pull a low sinker but grounded to
shortstop. Against closer Billy Wagner in the ninth, Sosa struck
out looking at a fastball down the middle to send fans to the exits
with two outs remaining.
</P>
<P>
   While teammates huddled around a television to watch the
conclusion of the Mets-Braves game, Sosa read a fax detailing the
destruction in the Dominican and talked with former Houston Rockets
center Kevin Willis.

McGWIRE SMASHES WAY TO HOME RUN NO. 66 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ For 45 minutes last night, Sammy Sosa stood alone as
baseball's single-season home-run king.
</P>
<P>
   Then, 780 miles away, Mark McGwire smashed another baseball into
the left-field seats at Busch Stadium and, in doing so, sent a
message back to Houston that the Great Home Run Chase could very
well go down to the last pitch of the last at-bat of the last game
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be an exciting weekend,'' McGwire prophesied
yesterday before hitting his 66th home run of the season in the
fifth inning of the Cardinals' 6-5 victory against the Montreal
Expos.
</P>
<P>
   So far he's right as yesterday's home run left McGwire tied with
archrival and bosom buddy Sammy Sosa, who hit his 66th for the Cubs
against the Houston Astros at the Astrodome. Both have two games
left, but Sosa could get extra chances if the Cubs are involved in
a playoff for the National League wild card.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned ... Mark McGwire and the home-run
chase is the most important thing the next two days,'' Cardinals
manager Tony La Russa said. ``That sounds like heresy, but he
deserves everything we can give him.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's 66th came off Expos rookie Shayne Bennett in his third
at-bat last night, just moments after Sosa had grounded out in his
third at-bat in the Astrodome. It came on a 1-2 pitch clocked at 79
mph, just after McGwire had hit another towering drive to left that
hooked foul into the upper deck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've hit a lot of foul balls down the line the last week,''
McGwire said. ``You see it and think, not again. But you have to
take a deep breath and get back in there. This time I was able to
get the head of the bat out there and center it.''
</P>
<P>
   Said La Russa: ``That was spectacular. That was almost as good
as 62.''
</P>
<P>
   La Russa conceded that it's unusual for a player to hit a home
run after the letdown of a near-miss but added, ``When has Mark
done anything usual or natural all year? He's been incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday marked only the second time this season Sosa has led
McGwire in home runs and the first time since they both surpassed
Roger Maris' record earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa took the lead briefly Aug. 19 when he hit his 48th home run
against the Cardinals. But McGwire came back and hit two in that
same game to regain the lead.
</P>
<P>
   This was also the 21st time this season McGwire and Sosa have
homered on the same day. McGwire said he heard from the crowd last
night that Sosa had hit a home run, but insisted he had no
emotional response to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought, he's hit another one,'' McGwire said. ``I've
said a thousand times this year, I can't control what he or anybody
else does. I can only control Mark McGwire swinging the bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is after what he and I have done, whoever ends on
top, nobody should feel bad. What we've done is something nobody
has ever done in the history of the game. Why should anybody walk
away disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's home run did set one record. It was his 34th home run
at home, tying Ted Kluszewski's National League mark for most in
one season. No telling what Kluszewski was doing on the road, since
he finished with just 49 total for the Reds in 1954. No word yet if
Major League Baseball will fly the late Kluszewski's family in for
the record-breaking ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   But even without them the finally thrilling chapter of a
yearlong epic is about to be written.

MALONE: SHEFF WILL BE IN LEFT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ New Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said
Friday he expects Gary Sheffield to be his starting left fielder
next season.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, who was lost for the season last month with a
sprained left ankle, took over in right field when he was acquired
May 15 from Florida. Raul Mondesi moved to center and played well
but wants to go back to right, where he won Gold Gloves the past
two years.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield and Mondesi are the highest-paid players on the team
and are finishing the first season of long-term contracts.
Sheffield has a six-year deal worth $68.5 million; Mondesi has a
four-year contract for $36 million. He also has two years at the
club option that bumps the deal to $60 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield has said publicly he will do whatever it takes to win,
including a move to left. Privately he has told a few teammates he
wants to remain in right. Sheffield began his career as a shortstop
in Milwaukee and played third base with San Diego in 1992 when he
won the National League batting title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not spoken directly to Gary about left field, but he
told the manager (Glenn Hoffman) he was agreeable,'' Malone said.
``That is the way I see the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi made a successful shift to center, but began to
experience lower back pain in August. He traced it to the added
burden of covering so much ground and told Hoffman he wasn't going
back next season.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi missed his second consecutive game Friday with a
sprained index finger on his right hand.
</P>
<P>
   Will Shaw want trade? Malone said he expects to head to the
Midwest and East Coast in the next two weeks to talk to several
players about their futures with the club. The biggest reason:
Dodgers closer Jeff Shaw is expected to demand a trade at the end
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Because Shaw, who has recorded 23 of his 46 saves since joining
the Dodgers at the All-Star break, was traded during a multi-year
contract, he has the leverage to get the Dodgers to move him,
preferably to a club closer to his home outside Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   But Malone, who helped revive Shaw's career in Montreal several
years ago, is confident he can get Shaw to remain with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he misses his family,'' Malone said. ``But I know he
also wants to win. And we can provide that. I didn't come here to
lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, 32, earned $650,000 this season, but the big money starts
kicking in during 1999. Shaw will earn $2.8 million in each of the
next three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   That is a relative bargain for a top-flight closer on today's
market. Shaw is only the second reliever in history to have
consecutive 40-save seasons. The other was Lee Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Texas right-hander John Wetteland is the highest-paid closer at
$5.7 million. Randy Myers, now a setup man in San Diego, is earning
$4.4 million. Trevor Hoffman, the Padres closer who has 52 saves,
is making $2.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Malone knows it will take a considerable pay raise to keep Shaw
in Los Angeles, but he also knows how much Shaw enjoyed playing in
Cincinnati, just a half-hour from his hometown in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw also is in the position to veto trades to six teams. He
said he will make his decision at the end of the season.

SALMON SURGERY SET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ The Angels' Tim Salmon, who has played on a partially
torn ligament in his left foot since April, will have surgery
Monday. The ligament, which is 75 percent torn, will be severed
completely in a procedure performed by Dr. Phil Kwong.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon has served as the Angels' designated hitter since
injuring his foot while rounding the bases on a home run hit April
22 off the Orioles' Scott Erickson. He stayed on the disabled list
through May 9 and has played since then with the tear, which
worsened throughout the season.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon, though, has managed to put up numbers similar to his
career averages. Going into Friday's game, he was hitting .301 with
26 homers and 88 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been the most trying, difficult and frustrating year
I've ever had in baseball,'' Salmon said. ``I ran the gamut of
pain, dealing with the pain and having a reduced role. Any time you
have to persevere through something, you come out stronger. I try
to find the positives. But if it had to happen again, would I do it
the same? I don't think I would.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon had the option of avoiding surgery and trying to rehab
the injury through rest. But he decided to have the surgery
immediately and is expected to require three months of recovery
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctor told me a month ago that the part (of the ligament)
that's still attached might never tear,'' Salmon said. ``But
there's still pain involved. I have a different appreciation for
the comments made by (Mark) McGwire (who had the same injury). When
he told me I should shut it down, I said, `What?!' Now, I have a
different appreciation for what he said.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Angels appreciate what Salmon has done for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm amazed by it, impressed by it,'' manager Terry Collins
said. ``We don't know what kind of pain he's in. But we can rest
assured he's in a lot of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Velarde returns:Second baseman Randy Velarde returned to the
team Friday after spending Thursday with his family in Midland,
Texas. Velarde's grandfather, Elias, 92, has been diagnosed with
leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said Velarde had as much time off as he needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm probably the only guy in the ballpark where this
(baseball) is everything,'' Collins said. ``For other guys, there's
life outside this.''
</P>
<P>
   The right choice: Collins shook up the lineup for Friday's game,
trying to get as many right-handed hitters in the game against A's
left-hander Kenny Rogers as possible. Garret Anderson and Darin
Erstad were on the bench, replaced in right field and at first base
by Reggie Williams and Craig Shipley, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darin's not swinging like he can, and Garret's in a little bit
of a funk,'' Collins said.

BROOKLYN TEACHER CONVICTED FOR AFFAIR WITH STUDENT, 16 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Brooklyn high school teacher was convicted Friday
of statutory rape and other charges for having a sexual
relationship with a student who was under 17, the legal age of
consent.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher, Joseph Rebecca, 36, of Canarsie, taught math at
Samuel J. Tilden High School. He was found to have engaged in
sexual activity with a student there from May to July of 1996, when
the girl was 16. The relationship continued into 1997,
investigators said, after the student turned 17 in July.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship ended when the student was told by schoolmates
that Rebecca was having an affair with a second student, a
law-enforcement official said. The girl became angry, the official
said, and told school authorities about her own relationship with
the teacher. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said that the second student had at first confirmed having a
relationship with Rebecca but later recanted.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca's lawyer, Alan I. Stutman, said after the verdict Friday
that there had been no sexual activity between Rebecca and the
student whose complaint led to the criminal charges. He said that
the student had been obsessed with Rebecca. The relationship, he
said, ``went from puppy love to infatuation to obsession.''
</P>
<P>
   But the law-enforcement official said that the relationship had
``evolved out of a mutual attraction'' between the math teacher and
the student, who was in one of his classes and was also in the
school's Haitian Club, to which Rebecca was an adviser. The
official said that the student who filed a complaint has since
graduated from Tilden.
</P>
<P>
   After a two-week trial, a jury of six men and six women in state
Supreme Court in Brooklyn convicted Rebecca of charges that
included five counts of third-degree rape and eight counts of
third-degree sodomy. Each of these counts carries a sentence of
11/3 to four years in prison. Justice Norman George ordered Rebecca
jailed pending his sentencing on Oct. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Stutman said his client would appeal his conviction. He said
Rebecca, who is not married, had been suspended from his teaching
post after his arrest and that he expected that the school system
would now dismiss him.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Stutman nor the Brooklyn district attorney's office
could say Friday how long Rebecca had been a teacher, and a
spokesman for the Board of Education, J.D. LaRock, said that
information could not be obtained late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In a highly publicized 1995 case, Glenn Harris, then a
33-year-old Manhattan gym teacher, disappeared with a 15-year-old
student for two months on a cross-country trip. After turning
himself in to school investigators, he was charged with kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said that he fled with the girl to help her escape
abusive parents. He pleaded guilty to a charge of custodial
interference and was sentenced to three years of probation.

NHL TEAMS NOT SEEING RED (LINE)
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The NHL stands guilty of tampering with its
own product this exhibition season as it explores ways to make its
product more appealing to TV sports junkies.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, for the exhibition game at the Forum between the
Kings and the Phoenix Coyotes, the league trotted out one of its
experimental rules, eliminating the center red line for offside
calls, though not for icing.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the rule should result in more scoring chances as
forwards hang out at the opposing blue line to cherry pick passes
from their defensemen.
</P>
<P>
   Asked before the game what he expected, Kings right wing Glen
Murray said: ``I have no idea. It could be 10-9.''
</P>
<P>
   Not quite. With the game early in the third period, neither team
had been able to capitalize on the experiment, and neither appeared
to have altered its game much to try to take advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings held a 3-1 lead with 18 minutes remaining. Russ
Courtnall (shorthanded), Murray and Philippe Boucher had the Kings'
goals, and Dallas Drake had the long score for the Coyotes. The
teams meet again tonight in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Jamie Storr practiced Friday morning for the
first time since signing his three-year contract worth a little
more than $3 million.... The angriest roar of the night was
reserved for referee Don Koharski, who called the fateful major
penalty on Sean O'Donnell during last spring's playoffs that turned
the tide against the Kings during Game 3 against St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Famer: Radio color commentator Cammi Granato will be
replaced in the broadcast booth for tonight's exhibition game at
Phoenix by former King Daryl Evans. Granato will be in Chicago,
where she will be inducted tonight into the Italian-American
Foundation Hall of Fame and honored as its athlete of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Granato led the U.S. women's hockey team to the gold medal
earlier this year at the Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets on sale: Individual game tickets go on sale at noon
Sunday at the Forum and all TicketMaster locations. The Kings'
annual open practice and skills competition is scheduled for 1 p.m.
at the Forum, with admission free for season-ticket holders and $5
for others wishing to attend. Proceeds will go to the Kings'
charitable foundation.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Edward M. Kerschner has seven television sets in his Long
Island, N.Y., home. His refrigerator is stocked with Snapple,
Coca-Cola and Hellmann's mayonnaise. And he brushes his teeth with
Crest.
</P>
<P>
   That may be more than you wanted to know about Kerschner, Paine
Webber's chief investment strategist, but his buying habits reflect
the trends that are influencing his stock picks.
</P>
<P>
   As he and other baby boomers age, says Kerschner, 45, the
attitudes of the largest, fastest-growing, wealthiest segment of
the population have changed _ and those changes are affecting what
boomers spend on everything from soft drinks to vacations.
</P>
<P>
   He says the trends, outlined in a recent Paine Webber report
titled ``The New Millennium American,'' provide tremendous
opportunities for certain business segments and companies that
satisfy the new demands.
</P>
<P>
   Kerschner's thinking goes like this: With most of their material
needs now satisfied, boomers today place more value on experiences
than on tangibles. That represents a vast change in consumer
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   He also says that peeking into the refrigerators, closets and
minds of boomers, to discover what they are buying and how they
spend their time, offers insights into the long-term trends that
drive product and service choices; in turn, that allows for
superior stock-picking by helping to identify the companies that
best serve boomers.
</P>
<P>
   These consumers _ now settling into middle age and beginning to
think ahead to old age _ are the ones who will drive corporate
prosperity for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're right about the trends, the stock-picking is easy,''
Kerschner said of this thematic investing approach. ``I mean, they
become obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   What are the trends that can make companies, and their
investors, wealthy? Based on a study Paine Webber commissioned from
Gallup and polls of consumer behavior conducted by Yankelovich
Partners, the brokerage firm identified five trends and some of the
businesses that should benefit by catering to boomers.
</P>
<P>
   Kerschner calls the first trend ``cradle-to-grave
entrepreneurialism.'' As Kerschner describes it in his report, it's
a hodgepodge of trendlets: people taking over responsibility for
their retirement through 401(k)s, more people working for smaller
companies, people changing jobs more often and taking it upon
themselves to get business training. And more people want to keep
working after retirement age.
</P>
<P>
   The trend of lifelong entrepreneurial workers, Kerschner
maintains, will benefit businesses whose products either are suited
for the home office or aid the entrepreneurial life by helping
people do their own taxes, investing and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Staples, the office supply company that keeps small companies
and home offices running, is a prime example. Kerschner forecasts
that its earnings per share will grow about 30 percent annually in
the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   The next trend, ``the time drought,'' is centered on his
observation that people's to-do lists are growing at breakneck
speed _ so much so that even ``spare time'' becomes stressful.
</P>
<P>
   Today, for example, it is common for people to simultaneously
drive a car, listen to the radio, conduct a phone meeting and
receive a fax. Kerschner thinks this sort of time management
overload is a huge plus for companies like Gap, Procter &AMP; Gamble
and Tiffany &AMP; Co. Why? Their trusted brand names save time by
making shopping easier.
</P>
<P>
   Kerschner estimates that Gap's earnings per share will grow 18
percent annually in the next five years and that those of Procter &AMP;
Gamble and Tiffany will grow 13 percent and 17 percent,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Another trend is something Kerschner calls ``the
no-service/full-service'' economy. Middle-market companies, like
retailers, are finding it impossible to provide much service to the
masses at a reasonable price because of a tight labor market.
</P>
<P>
   And most people are learning to do without service, either by
shopping the Internet or by frequenting retailers that offer
efficiency and good value. That should be a plus for companies like
Wal-Mart and Bed, Bath and Beyond. Paine Webber estimates that
earnings per share at Bed, Bath and Beyond will grow 28 percent
annually and those of Wal-Mart about 14 percent annually in the
next five years.
</P>
<P>
   The big Internet beneficiary, he says, is America Online, where
consumers can buy everything from jeans to Jeeps. He projects 50
percent annual growth in its earnings per share over five years.
</P>
<P>
   But a bifurcated economy is developing, as the carriage trade _
including many of the stressed-out, time-starved consumers that
Kerschner identifies in ``the time drought _ is demanding more
service. This will benefit retailers known for their service,
including Nordstrom, whose earnings per share Kerschner sees
growing at 15 percent a year over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He likes the retailer for its willingness to raise customers'
hemlines on demand or ship a product across the globe in the name
of superior service.
</P>
<P>
   Kerschner also believes in what the report describes as ``the
new drug culture'' _ boomers' penchant for using drugs to ``fix
things.'' Think Pfizer's Viagra. The study concludes that because
of this trend, boomers are attracted to ``better-for-you'' consumer
products, too. That explains the rise in demand for herbal
supplements, hair growth medication and prescription diet pills.
</P>
<P>
   In general, drug giants like Schering-Plough, with a projected
earnings growth rate of 14 percent a year for the next five years,
should benefit by being in a market that serves an increasingly
aging population.
</P>
<P>
   The strategist also sees growing demand for what he calls
``stressless leisure.'' Boomers, Kerschner says, want more fun with
less effort as they age. By this way of thinking, donkey rides down
the Grand Canyon are out and cruises are in. More than 90 percent
want ``relaxing'' vacations, the survey says.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that could capitalize on this trend include Delta Air
Lines, whose earnings per share Kerschner expects to grow 12
percent a year in the next five years, and the Carnival Corp.,
which he sees growing at a 17 percent pace.
</P>
<P>
   Kerschner also likes Four Seasons Hotels, where overworked,
stressed-out boomers can turn for rejuvenation. He expects its
earnings per share to grow at a 20 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these trends, of course, represent rather touchy-feely
thoughts by Wall Street standards, and are certainly debatable.
Even so, Kerschner, a mathematician by training, is paid to be
right. And he is convinced that studying what he calls ``shared
life experiences'' of certain groups instead of traditional
business cycles is a sure way to pick a stock winner.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say he doesn't look at price-to-earnings and
debt-to-capitalization ratios. He simply prefers to factor in
emerging trends than to reflect on past patterns and behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``The street typically analyzes historical patterns and says,
`Oh, it's happening again,''' Kerschner said. ``Historically,
analysts look at the past to predict the future, but in this case,
the past is not going to predict behavior because of shared life
experiences'' that change from generation to generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember gas lines; my parents remember bread lines,'' he
said, adding that those benchmarks, in part, set the tone for each
groups' political and marketplace priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees with all of Paine Webber's conclusions. One
marketing expert said she agreed with the drug-culture concept and
had no problem with the work-beyond-retirement claim, but she
questioned the assumption that boomers wanted stressless leisure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing much more exotic vacations,'' said Cynthia R.
Cohen president of Strategic Mindshare, a marketing and management
consulting firm in Miami. ``Do you know how many people are going
on safaris?''
</P>
<P>
   Boomers, she said, are more concerned than ever with their golf
scores and ``upset that they can't shoot hoops the way they used
to.''

TO OUTSIDERS, ONLY ONE WORLD EXISTS IN NEBRASKA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN, Neb. _ If there were any mistaking where one was, the
giant billboard on the highway entering town vaporized the
ambiguity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome,'' it said in 10-foot letters, ``to the football
center of the universe.''
</P>
<P>
   Subtle, these Nebraskans.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with three national championships in the last four years, no
one on the planet has a good counter-argument against the
University of Nebraska football team. And the morning line from
Vegas has the Cornhuskers favored by 10 over the Vulcans and two
over the Klingons.
</P>
<P>
   As for the University of Washington Huskies this afternoon, well
... they had their meteoric moment, in 1991, the last time the
Huskers lost at home, 44 games ago.
</P>
<P>
   The football universe is different now, filled by a red giant of
a star.
</P>
<P>
   If the billboard wasn't sufficient as a symbol, there is the
state capitol. A 14-story art-deco rocket ship of a building a few
blocks from campus, it looms alone above the prairie. By municipal
law, no building can be taller.
</P>
<P>
   Atop the dome of this incongruent obelisk is a 20-foot brass
statue. Political satirist Mark Russell once said it looked like a
woman bowling. But he doesn't know sports. To me, it appeared to be
a Husker tailback on an option dive.
</P>
<P>
   What else could better represent the state?
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, there is more to us than football,'' said a smiling E.
Benjamin Nelson, an affable Democrat finishing up his second and
final term as governor.
</P>
<P>
   The statue, it was pointed out, is called ``The Sower,'' a woman
spreading seed upon the fruited plain. Nelson too, is a sower,
trying to plant ideas in a skeptical Seattle sports columnist that
there is something going on in his state besides stone-faced talks
among the citizenry about squat lifts and zone blitzes.
</P>
<P>
   He certainly has convinced his fellow heartlanders that
something else is going on. Nelson's approval rating in statewide
opinion polls is more than 80 percent. Considering that Santa
Claus' career high rating in Nebraska was 87 percent _ he wears a
lot of red, you know? _ Nelson is on the frontier in ways more than
his address.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the firm-handshake, good-hair veneer of his profession,
Nelson is a big-time mover on international trade, since his
state's production of corn, soybeans, beef and feed grain in almost
as impressive as the football program's production of first downs
on the tailback pitch.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, trade was the topic of the fifth annual Diplomats
Weekend in Lincoln, in which Nelson invites business, political and
civic leaders from around the state, as well as national and
international guests, to talk about getting Nebraska's agriculture
and industry spread to the far corners.
</P>
<P>
   He likes to say things like ``we're local producers, but world
providers,'' and trots about impressive statistics about Nebraska's
substantial economy and impact.
</P>
<P>
   Friday at his CEO Roundtable panel at a downtown hotel, he had
the chief of Argentina's cabinet of ministers, Jorge Rodriguez,
tout the virtues of Nelson's trade initiatives as well as his
nation's eagerness to find Nebraska investors.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez also acquired his Master's and doctorate at the
University of Nebraska. He knows the local culture. So much so that
he taught Nelson the Spanish version of the state mantra.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vamos rojo grande,'' said Nelson, beaming to his audience.
</P>
<P>
   Go Big Red.
</P>
<P>
   There is no escaping it, even in a room of serious suits talking
billions of dollars. Several of the panelists began their
presentation with football references, to make sure they were
connecting with the audience.
</P>
<P>
   The president of a big Minneapolis company, Ernie Micek,
immediately tossed out statistics guaranteed to win sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember these numbers _ 506 and 72,'' he said. ``That's the
cumulative score of the series between Nebraska and the University
of Minnesota.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't need to mention which was which.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a coincidence that Nelson marshaled the state's
leaders and out-of-state guests on a home football weekend. Nor was
it a coincidence that one of the eight panelists was Tom Osborne,
who retired as Nebraska's coach in December after 25 years of
achievement on and off the field. Osborne was there to promote his
``Teammates'' campaign, a new statewide mentoring program that
attempts to pair adults with at-risk kids. The endeavor sounded
very worthy, even if a little askew amid the talk of factories and
corn bushels.
</P>
<P>
   But if you are selling steak in Nebraska, there is only one kind
of sizzle that goes with it.
</P>
<P>
   As Scott Moore, the secretary of state, put it after the
roundtable, ``On ESPN, they don't talk about corn or soy futures.''
</P>
<P>
   ESPN, along with the other networks and most newspapers and
magazines, don't much care about the ins and outs of world
agriculture. If you're talking the ins and outs of the Huskers'
quarterback spot, now we have meaning.
</P>
<P>
   If the world knows this place only through football, well,
that's OK with most Nebraskans. If they weren't known for football,
it's apparent that these folks might not have captured the
attention of anybody for anything.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the obvious circumstances of geographic isolation, small
population, an absence of major league activities as well as the
absence of another Division I football school in the state, there
is something else about the place of football in the culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think about it, Nebraska is always a place that other
people went through,'' said Moore. ``The Pony Express, the Oregon
Trail, the Morman Trail, the Union Pacific railroad. These are all
important things in our history, but they were made by people going
somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Nebraska football team gives people a reason to come back
here.''
</P>
<P>
   They are back here this weekend, a swirling ocean of red-clad
rooters who reconvene with their heritage via a big intersectional
football game. It is why, after hours of speechifying on important
world topics at the Roundtable, the first question to the panelists
from the audience went to Osborne:
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's gonna win (Saturday)?''
</P>
<P>
   They really don't expect outsiders to understand, especially
wise-guy sports columnists. Which is why Nelson, after bantering
with his Seattle visitor who a year ago irked him with
disparagements about about his state, unleashed the hospitality for
which Nebraskans may someday be known as much as football.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are,'' he said, ``granted immunity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, great,'' I said. Then I looked over his shoulder out the
window to the streets of Lincoln, knowing how deep they would run
red the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I have it in writing?''

SEAHAWKS HOPE TO MAKE STATEMENT VS. STEELERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND _ Sam Adams is sorry, but the Seahawks' defensive
tackle is tired of feeling like has to say he's sorry.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks are 3-0 for the first time since 1986 and have a
realistic shot at the franchise's first 4-0 start in Sunday's game
against a struggling Pittsburgh Steelers team at Three Rivers
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But many still-skeptical fans are taking a who-have-they-beaten
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like we're supposed to apologize for our
schedule,'' Adams said. ``It's like, `Gee, sorry we've only beaten
the first three teams we've played.' We didn't schedule these
teams. But we did beat these teams.''
</P>
<P>
   It's just that those teams have been the Philadelphia Eagles,
Arizona Cardinals and Washington Redskins, who are a combined 1-8.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Sunday's game against the Steelers, next week's game
at Kansas City and the Oct. 11 game against the Denver Broncos at a
soldout Kingdome have become statement-making opportunities for the
Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   This three-game stretch provides a team that did serious damage
to a trio of lightweights from the NFC East a chance to show it is
a serious contender in the AFC.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big game because it's a better team and we're on the
road,'' quarterback Warren Moon said. ``But we're just taking the
attitude that it's another big game on our schedule. This is the
biggest game we've played because it's this week's game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks can beat the Steelers. Whether they will or not
hinges on their ability to:
</P>
<P>
   -- Run the ball. After leading the NFL in passing offense last
year, the Seahawks are running to set up the pass.
</P>
<P>
   So far, it has been an efficient if not overpowering formula.
They have had a 100-yard rusher in three straight games for the
first time in club history. Moon's quarterback rating of 101.2 ties
him for second-best in the AFC, and he has thrown six TD passes and
no interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers allowed the Dolphins' Karim Abdul-Jabbar to rush
for 108 yards in last week's 21-0 loss at Miami, but it took him 33
carries. It broke the Steelers' string of 22 straight
regular-season games without allowing a 100-yard rusher.
</P>
<P>
   From 1993-1997, the Steelers allowed 3.43 yards per rush _ the
second-best average over a five-year span in league history to the
1971-75 Dallas Cowboys (3.40). The Steelers have not allowed a
100-yard rusher at Three Rivers since 1995, when then-Patriot
Curtis Martin went for 120.
</P>
<P>
   -- Stop the run. The Seahawks have been vulnerable to runs up
the middle. The Redskins' Terry Allen had a 92-yard effort last
week. The Eagles' Duce Staley ran for 95 yards in the opener. The
Cardinals' Adrian Murrell went for 79 yards in Week 2.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes Jerome Bettis. The Bus didn't complete his route last
week, rushing for 48 yards on just 13 carries. But since joining
the Steelers in 1996, Bettis has never had sub-100 yard efforts in
back-to-back games he has started and finished. In fact, he has
rushed for triple digits in 21 of 32 full games _ sitting out the
season finale last year with an injury and being limited to six and
three carries in the final two games in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks will go light at linebacker for the second straight
week, with 230-pound Darrin Smith starting in the middle and
226-pound James Logan replacing Smith on the right side.
</P>
<P>
   -- Beat the Steelers at Three Rivers. The Steelers are 32-8
under coach Bill Cowher at home and have won eight straight.
</P>
<P>
   They were shut out last week for the first time since 1993 and
only the fourth time in the past 10 seasons. But they are 3-0 when
playing at home after those shutout losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Cowher is a fiery guy. He's going to challenge the team
this week,'' said linebacker Chad Brown, who signed with the
Seahawks last year after playing four seasons in Pittsburgh. ``It's
going to be up to us to No. 1, slow Jerome down, and then for our
offense to go out and prove we can move the ball against one of the
best defenses in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't begun to fire on all cylinders yet,'' he said.
``And this is a game where we need all cylinders to win.''
</P>
<P>
   HAWK TALK: LB Dean Wells will play Sunday, but won't start.
Wells has been sidelined with a pulled calf muscle for the first
three games. ... In Pittsburgh, DE Nolan Harrison was downgraded
from questionable to out with a strained hamstring. Orpheus Roye
will start for Harrison. ... FS Eric Stokes, TE Itula Mili, OT Todd
Weiner and DT Riddick Parker were named inactive by the Seahawks.
The Steelers' inactive list: Harrison, CB Deshea Townsend, OT Chris
Conrad and WR Jahine Arnold.

WEAKENING LA NINA MAY NOT BRING DRY WINTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID R. BAKER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Despite predictions that La Nina would bring Los
Angeles a dry winter and possibly worsen the fire season, the
weather phenomenon now appears to be losing strength, according to
scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The pool of cold Pacific water that is the heart of La Nina has
shrunk to one-fourth the size it was in May, even as warm water
left over from El Nino remains, said Bill Patzert, a researcher at
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration laboratory in
suburban Pasadena. If La Nina dissipates before it hits Los
Angeles, the area could face a more typical wet winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a question at this point: Will La Nina wane as El
Nino lingers?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   La Nina and El Nino form the opposite ends of the same climatic
cycle, with El Nino fueled by unusually warm water in the eastern
Pacific and La Nina driven by cold. Each can bring drought to some
parts of the planet while drenching others with rain.
</P>
<P>
   Just two weeks ago, National Weather Service experts predicted
that La Nina -- a phenomenon whose effects are roughly the opposite
of El Nino's -- would bring Los Angeles a slightly drier year than
normal.
</P>
<P>
   Don't count La Nina out yet. Patzert and other weather experts
say the cold water pool often fluctuates in size as the phenomenon
builds.
</P>
<P>
   ``El Nino and La Nina are things that change slowly over time,''
said Ants Leetmaa, director of the weather service's Climate
Prediction Center. ``It's pretty dangerous to look week to week.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the center predicted that after rapid cooling during the
summer, ocean temperatures would rebound before cooling again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The forecasts are still on track,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the current La Nina conditions are following on the
heels of last winter's El Nino, they often occur years apart and
don't alternate in an orderly progression.
</P>
<P>
   This summer has been unusual, with a growing La Nina sharing the
ocean with remnants of the strongest El Nino on record. Although La
Nina is already affecting rainfall in Southeast Asia, it hasn't
noticeably influenced North America's weather yet, Leetmaa said
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it may be that warm water left over from El Nino is
contributing to the formation of more tropical storms than normal
in the eastern Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a hundred-year El Nino, and it really rang the
Pacific's bell,'' Leetmaa said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN, Neb. _ On an Indian-summer afternoon in the mid-80s
yesterday at Nebraska's Memorial Stadium, Jim Lambright, the
University of Washington football coach, showed up wearing a
long-sleeved black shirt, black vest and black pants.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the assumption by Lambright's Huskies is that they
don't get inundated by Nebraska's Blackshirts. That's what the
Huskers like to call their defense.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe subconsciously, Lambright can't get used to being here.
Remember, this Nebraska game wasn't his idea.
</P>
<P>
   When athletic director Barbara Hedges allowed Missouri out of a
contract a few years ago and took on the dreaded Huskers, Lambright
was OK with the 1997 game at Husky Stadium. But he wanted the road
rematch deferred so the '98 schedule wouldn't be so diabolical,
especially for a team relatively young.
</P>
<P>
   Valor prevailed over discretion, and here are the eighth-ranked
Huskies, about to take on the No. 2-rated team in the nation in
college football's feature game Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to go in without a conscience,'' said Brock Huard,
the UW quarterback. ``We went to ASU without a conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   The scheduling issue takes on focus because while the Huskies
have been judged in one rating to have the fourth-toughest in the
nation, Nebraska has again opened the season by punching out
no-counts and ne'er-do-wells disguised as Louisiana Tech,
Alabama-Birmingham and Cal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is their season opener,'' Huard said. ``They might not
admit to that, but we know it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to come at us in ways they haven't shown yet.''
</P>
<P>
   And when Nebraska comes at you _ as opposed to the way, say, New
Mexico State comes at you _ you can get beat up.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Nebraska's All-America end, Grant Wistrom, lunged at
Huard's shins after he threw a pass late in the first quarter.
Huard suffered a sprained ankle and the Huskies lost 27-14.
</P>
<P>
   Surely Nebraska will aim more such abuse Huard's way Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to come after me,'' Huard said. ``That's the way
the game's played. You look at the next level, and you've got to
hit the quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Count on it, says Chad Kelsay, who has been Nebraska's best
pass-rusher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he's coming in here, saying to himself last year was
a fluke or something,'' Kelsay said. ``I think if we can rattle his
cage a little at the beginning of the game, he's going to be
thinking about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like the guys who are going to sit back there in the pocket
and throw the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Linehan, the UW offensive coordinator, can offer Huard
only a plan and some ``hot'' receivers to dump the ball to when it
gets dicey. His description of Nebraska's defense won't soothe
Huard much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Awesome,'' Linehan said. ``They've got the best pair of
speed-rushing ends (Kelsay and Mike Rucker) we'll see all season. I
see about eight, nine guys that are going to be in the NFL starting
on their defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Slotback Dane Looker's return _ albeit as he nurses a thigh
bruise _ should help Huard. Still, with Washington desperate to
establish a running game, the matchup Saturday is about as extreme
as it gets _ a team that has gravitated to the pass against the
ground-bound Huskers.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Washington was embarrassed by Nebraska's option
attack, allowing 384 yards rushing. Several factors seem to point
to better success against it this year: a rebuilt Husker offensive
line, a different backfield featuring quarterback Bobby Newcombe
and I-back DeAngelo Evans, and Washington's having experienced the
offense in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're in shock that first series,'' Randy Hart, the UW
defensive coordinator, said about the speed of the attack. ``The
worst thing you can do is change the game plan then.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Jabari Issa, the Husky defensive tackle: ``They have so
many ways of getting the ball up the middle or around the side.
When you tackle somebody, it's almost a gamble sometimes, because
you don't see the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   When it gets to the perimeter, one of the imponderables is the
Huskies' rover, Nigel Burton. The only Husky to have played in
Memorial Stadium, he has been gimpy with a sprained ankle, and _
undersized as he is at 180 pounds _ he is important to Washington's
defensive plan, because his backups lack experience.
</P>
<P>
   One such contingency is free safety Brendan Jones moving to
Burton's spot, and promising freshman free safety Hakim Akbar
supplanting Jones. But Burton will go as long as he can in the kind
of physical test he enjoys most.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's me and you,'' Burton says defiantly, ``and you might be
bigger than I am, but I don't give a damn.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton's ability to play a full game is in question, as is
linebacker Lester Towns'. The Huskies had Towns wear a boot
yesterday to protect his troublesome foot, and he didn't practice.
</P>
<P>
   Washington coaches have plotted an expanded role for backup
quarterback Marques Tuiasosopo, figuring that he's too good to keep
on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   They also know that no time is great to play Nebraska, but
perhaps this is as good as any. Not only are the Huskers retooling,
Washington is 2-0 and playing with house money after the surprise
victory at Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us is thinking, `Let's make it respectable, let's make
it close,''' Huard insisted. ``We're thinking we're going to win.''

ACID TEST FOR COUGARS, BEARS IN PAC-10 OPENER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ The Washington State Cougars finally leave
their backyard Saturday to face the California Golden Bears in the
Pac-10 Conference opener for both teams.
</P>
<P>
   After two home games and one at Boise State, Cal's Memorial
Stadium will be an altogether different place to play for the
Cougars. Rarely filled to half its 75,000-seat capacity, the
concrete confines can lull a team to sleep and the atmosphere could
have hallucinogenic effects on the unprepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a difficult place to play because of the uniqueness of
the stadium and their fans,'' Price said of the stadium built in
1923 to resemble the Colosseum in Rome. `` ... It's farther
removed, the crowd is a little quieter, a little more subdued. Even
though it's bigger, with more people, it's just a different feeling
when you go into that stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bears, who were thrashed 63-37 last year in Pullman, can't
wait to get the Cougars on their home turf. Cal is 24-9-3 against
WSU in games played in Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad we play Washington State here,'' said Cal coach Tom
Holmoe, in his second year after going 3-8 in 1997. `` ... It is
good to be home and have this one ready to go because it is our
(conference) opener and it is a huge game.''
</P>
<P>
   Cal is 2-1 with victories over Oklahoma and Houston. The loss
was to Nebraska, a respectable 24-3 defeat at Memorial Stadium,
which was nearly filled to capacity for for a non-conference game
for the first time in four decades.
</P>
<P>
   For WSU, Cal expects a crowd of only 35,000.
</P>
<P>
   But at 3-0, the defending Pac-10 champion Cougars represent the
most important game to date to Holmoe and his Bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is bigger than Nebraska, bigger than our opener
against Houston and bigger than Oklahoma on the road because it
counts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule works to Cal's advantage, too. The Bears get a bye
next weekend and can focus solely on the Cougars. WSU travels to
Pasadena next Saturday to face UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``The schedule, the way it is now, benefits us in that we have a
very good team to play, the defending Pac-10 champs, and then we
have a bye,'' Holmoe said. ``It doesn't allow us to look down the
road.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars, however, look at Cal as the first true test of
whether they can make it to consecutive bowl games for the first
time in school history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to bring our motivation, our inspiration and our
spirit with us. All those things have to come from within,'' said
Price, whose traveling squad includes 30 first-year players. ``We
aren't going to have the aid of the fog and the band and the town
cheering for you as you run out onto the field. Because it isn't
going to be like that.''
</P>
<P>
   And he doesn't expect anything like last year's offensive
donnybrook.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to be a little better than we were against Idaho,
and we just have to be little bit better than Cal, and we just have
to win by one point,'' Price said. ``I don't care how we do it.
Fumble recovery. Intercepted pass. Long touchdown pass. It doesn't
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   CALIFORNIA DREAMING: Playing in Berkeley gives the Cougars a
chance to showcase their program to potential Bay Area recruits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we have two top-notch prospects that are coming to the
game not only to evaluate the Cal Bears, but to look at the
Washington State Cougars, too,'' Price said.
</P>
<P>
   Current Cougars plucked from the Bay Area include free safety
Lamont Thompson and three junior college transfers from San
Francisco City College: running back Kevin Brown, defensive back
Chris Martin and receiver Jerry Roquemore.
</P>
<P>
   NOT SO FAB: With the exception of two seniors, wide receiver
Nian Taylor and tight end Love Jefferson, the rest of the receiving
corps has been getting fairly low marks from the coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seem to need work on just about everything,'' Price said.
``I wish I could say that wasn't the case. But from alignment,
assignment, running routes, blocking, catching, we just need to
improve.''
</P>
<P>
   The new group includes junior college transfers Leaford Hackett
and Roquemore, and redshirt freshmen Adam Davis and Jason White, as
well as junior Troy Woody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we have stunk it up by any means. I think we're
doing OK,'' Price said. ``But we just haven't made the plays that
they are capable of making.''

TRAFFIC COP PULLS OVER LONG-LOST FATHER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSE HIESTAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- For five blocks, LAPD patrol Officer Kelly
Benitez debated whether to stop a Ford Thunderbird for expired
registration tags.
</P>
<P>
   It was the most important decision he ever made.
</P>
<P>
   Against all odds, the driver turned out to be his long-lost
father -- the father he had never known, the father he had wanted
to meet for so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at his eyes, and it seemed funny,'' Benitez said
Friday. ``I saw some similarities to myself, and that made me look
at the name on the license. It was Paul Benitez.''
</P>
<P>
   As Kelly Benitez knew, that was the name of his father, the man
who had walked out of his life when he was just 4 months old.
</P>
<P>
   With the expired tags forgotten, the two men quizzed each other
on family history and soon realized they were reunited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought: `Oh, my Lord. It can't be. What are the odds?' ''
said Paul Benitez Jr. ``So I just came flat-out and asked him, `Are
you Kelly?' and he said, `Yes,' and I said, `Oh, my God, I'm your
father.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, they live just five miles from each other in
suburban Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a dream. Every day I ask myself: `Is this really
happening? Did I really find him?' '' Paul Benitez Jr. said during
a news conference at which the two told their amazing tale.
</P>
<P>
   Both men say they had spent years looking for one another,
through professional search services and the Internet. Kelly
Benitez said he was forbidden by Los Angeles Police Department
rules from doing a personal search for his father through
Department of Motor Vehicles records or other government databases.
</P>
<P>
   Since they were reunited Sept. 18, the two men have spent a day
together, getting to know each other and discussing politics,
sports and the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very curious about each other, but we're really
different,'' said Paul Benitez Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The father is a Democrat, his son a Republican. Kelly Benitez
says he favors Sammy Sosa in the baseball home-run derby; his
father would prefer that Sosa and Mark McGwire end the season in a
tie.
</P>
<P>
   What they share is a desire to put their separation behind them
and jump-start their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of guilt, a lot of unfinished business,'' Paul
Benitez Jr. said. ``I just wish I could have been there earlier for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Benitez Jr. was 19, fresh from Bell Gardens High School in
East Los Angeles, when he had a child with a teen-ager named Debra.
He joined the Army, she moved away, and they drifted apart.
</P>
<P>
   On the only occasion he saw his son, Benitez was in uniform. A
photo was taken, one that Kelly Benitez has carried with him for
nearly three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Benitez was raised by his grandparents in Glendora and
also lost touch with his mom, who now lives in Northern California.
He did not want to reveal her last name since she has not yet been
notified of his reunion with his father.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Benitez Jr. now teaches sixth grade at Bird Middle School
in suburban Sun Valley.
</P>
<P>
   In his three years as an LAPD officer, Kelly Benitez said he has
stopped several people with the surname Benitez and often had asked
them a few questions to see if they were relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Benitez Jr. concedes that when he saw that they shared the
same name, he had hoped to use that fact to bluff his way out of a
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   He told the officer he was heading to the DMV that very minute
to renew his car registration.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what they all say,'' Kelly Benitez recalled of the
traffic stop.
</P>
<P>
   When the officer later realized he had found his father, ``his
jaw dropped and he said, `Get out of the car,' '' Paul Benitez Jr.
said. ``We started hugging and people pulled over thinking I was
wrestling with this cop.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the expired tags, Benitez said his son gave him a
warning, and that the renewal check is in the mail to the DMV.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout their roadside reunion, Kelly Benitez said, he was
skeptical of the other man, so much so that he had his father
follow him back to the police station so they could talk.
</P>
<P>
   The snapshot proved to be the key piece of evidence. Paul
Benitez Jr. knew what and who was in the picture before he was
shown it by his son.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Benitez said he does not expect an apology from his mother
or father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what it's like to be 18 or 19,'' he said. ``I
understand the facts of being a young person and understand that
time, and I know no one's perfect. So as far as I'm concerned, it's
just water under the bridge.''

RANGERS NEED CLARK AND HIS HARDBALL WAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Broken toe and all, no one enjoyed last night's
Rangers division title clinching celebration more than Will Clark.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of grit in this clubhouse,'' Clark said. ``A lot
of heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty four hours earlier, Clark's right's foot was stuck in a
bag of ice, his eyes were scanning the room like twin radar dishes
and his mouth was rattling off a steady stream of caustic
wisecracks like a machine gun on automatic fire.
</P>
<P>
   None of those three facts will elicit any news bulletins.
</P>
<P>
   Not for the first time, I was nailed in the crossfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're hovering,'' he barked in my direction. ``Why are you
hovering? It makes me nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   I'd been standing a few feet away, trying to figure out a safe
approach to a man who'd drilled a five-ounce baseball off his right
big toe at about a hundred miles an hour some 90 minutes earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Now this would be painful under normal circumstances. The fact
that the toe had already been fractured less than two weeks ago
intensified the pain to an excruciating degree.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine slamming your finger in a car door. Now, just about the
time the purple bruises start yellowing, do it again. Get the idea?
</P>
<P>
   Clark had writhed in the dirt at home plate in the fourth inning
like a sunfish that had just been yanked onto a fishing dock. He
went down on his back, then spun over on his knees, his weight
forward, on his batting helmet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was as white as a sheet,'' manager Johnny Oates would say
after the Rangers' 9-3 victory Thursday in Game 1 of this series
had cut their magic number to clinching the AL West title to ``1.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every bit of blood had drained from his face and he was
incoherent.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark incoherent is not necessarily anything new, but normally
it's by choice. Not this time. Reluctantly he limped off to the
clubhouse for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   By the time reporters arrived in the clubhouse after the game,
he'd had _ to put it delicately _ several pain killers. Clark
feeling no pain can be even more daunting than when he's hurting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't come over here feeling sorry for me,'' he snapped. ``I
don't need your sympathy. It's just part of baseball. You do just
one thing; you suck it up and you go back out there again tomorrow
and you play.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it was that Clark was back in the lineup last night at
the Kingdome. His only concession to his injury was that he allowed
Oates to pencil him in at DH and not first base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I despise DH'ing,'' Clark said. ``It drives me up the wall,
and I drive my teammates up the wall in the dugout. But it's better
than not playing at all.''
</P>
<P>
   I keep picturing a Clark poster I'd like to see. He'd be
standing there, leaning on his bat, with these arrows drawn in and
pointing to various body parts that have been battered and broken
over the years. His ribs, his knee, both elbows, his right leg,
from thigh to the tip of his toes, because of all the foul balls he
has ricocheted off it.
</P>
<P>
   He'd be wearing eye black, of course, and that sneer we've all
seen so often.
</P>
<P>
   There'd be a caption under it, too, something simple and to the
point.
</P>
<P>
   Hardball Player.
</P>
<P>
   This is my way of finally getting around to this conclusion:
Clark needs to be re-signed by the Rangers for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   I concede this somewhat reluctantly, because Clark and I have
had our ups and downs since he arrived in '94. At various times
he's stubborn, arrogant, insensitive and downright rude. He can be
impossible to talk to because he already thinks he knows everything
you've got to say. He should listen more and talk less.
</P>
<P>
   But he has had a remarkable renaissance of a season _ he'll
argue with that terminology, but it's true _ and the Rangers will
still need a first baseman next year.
</P>
<P>
   Even better, Clark, who enjoys living in the area and wants to
stay, will make it easy for Doug Melvin and the Rangers. Money, he
says, won't be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very flexible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That sounds like he would be amenable to an incentive-laden
deal, maybe one-year with an option, allowing Melvin to concentrate
most of his resources on signing shortstop Royce Clayton and more
pitching. Randy Johnson and Todd Stottlemyre would be a good start.

RANGERS WIN AL WEST DESPITE BEING ROUTED BY MARINERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Eleven-run losses don't inspire hangovers.
</P>
<P>
   Champagne does, and it flowed and sprayed freely in The
Kingdome's visiting clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers _ despite last night's 15-4 loss to the Seattle
Mariners _ celebrated their second American League West title in
three seasons after the Anaheim Angels lost, 7-2, at Oakland,
eliminating themselves from contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the first champagne celebration we want to
have,'' Rangers second baseman Mark McLemore said. ``We want three
more just as good or better. We're going to enjoy this tonight and
then get back to work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is only step one,'' closer John Wetteland said. ``We'll
celebrate tonight, but there's a lot of unfinished business.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers remain one game behind the Cleveland Indians, who
lost last night, for home-field advantage in one of the two
best-of-five, divisional playoff series. They would begin the
postseason Tuesday against the Yankees in New York based on the
league's standings entering today's games. If Texas ties or passes
Cleveland in the final two days, the Rangers will play Boston in
the divisional series, with the first two games in Arlington on
Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers players learned of the Angels' loss during the ninth
inning here last night. Several went to the clubhouse and began
celebrating while their teammates finished their last at-bat. The
scoreboard in the Kingdome stayed an inning or two behind the
Angels-Athletics game and did not reflect that it actually ended
with two innings remaining in the Rangers-Mariners game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was at my request,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said.
``Bucky (Dent) told me it was a final in the bottom of the seventh
or maybe the top of the eighth. But I wanted us to stay
professional right down to the end. I don't think it looks
professional to be high-fiving on the field in the middle of a
game, especially one we were losing big like that one.''
</P>
<P>
   As for any thought that the Rangers backed into the title,
McLemore said, ``We won the West in '98. That's all that counts. We
won more games than anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers won the West earlier this week with their three-game
sweep of the Angels in Anaheim. That gave the Rangers a three-game
lead in the AL West and reduced their magic number to two entering
this four-game series in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't a dry spot in the clubhouse last night when the
game did end. The players sprayed champagne all over the room and
all over each other. When the bubbly was gone, they did the same
with beer.
</P>
<P>
   Oates got it. General manager Doug Melvin got it. Club president
Tom Schieffer got it. Every player got it. Friends and strangers
got it.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Aaron Sele was trying to stay as dry as possible. Rick
Helling spotted him, grabbed him and doused him.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish-language broadcaster Luis Mayoral stayed on the outside,
hoping nobody would notice him. It didn't last. Someone grabbed him
with a bear hug, carried him to the middle of the clubhouse and he
was soaked.
</P>
<P>
   It many ways, it was a typical title-clinching celebration.
</P>
<P>
   In others, it was different.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, there was a sense of relief because it was the club's
first ever title. Last night, there might have been a slightly
different feel because of the way they won. The Rangers were tied
with the Angels on Monday, but they went into Anaheim and swept a
three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one feels pretty special because of the way we did it,''
first baseman Will Clark said. ``We won when we had to,
head-to-head with Anaheim. That's why it feels special.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners ensured that the Rangers would not clinch this
title with a victory at the Kingdome on the strength of their
four-run third and fourth innings.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Esteban Loaiza, who allowed six of those runs
during his three-inning appearance, likely will be banished to the
bullpen for the postseason after his fourth consecutive poor
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza surrendered a two-run double to center fielder Ken
Griffey Jr. _ who later hit his 56th home run this season off
left-hander Eric Gunderson during the sixth inning _ and
run-scoring base hits to second baseman David Bell and designated
hitter Edgar Martinez during the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Russ Davis and first baseman Raul Ibanez led off
the fourth inning with consecutive singles against Loaiza, and
manager Johnny Oates removed the right-hander and summoned
left-hander Greg Cadaret from the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Joe Oliver deposited Cadaret's third pitch into the
seats in right-center field for a three-run homer, and a
run-scoring single later in the inning by shortstop Alex Rodriguez
gave the Mariners an 8-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers did not experience such success against the
Mariners' Paul Abbott. The 30-year-old right-hander surrendered
four runs on two two-run homers during the seventh and ninth
innings by first baseman Lee Stevens. Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Todd Stottlemyre was removed as today's starter, with Eric
Gunderson to take his place. Rick Helling may or may not pitch an
inning or two over the next couple of days.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll be ready to pitch in the first two games of the
playoffs, whether we're on the road against the Yankees or at home
against the Red Sox,'' Oates said. He said the Rangers will piece
their pitching tomorrow against the Mariners, and bring someone in,
probably Jonathan Johnson, to start Sunday.

DODGERS DRAW 3 MILLION _ FOR LAST TIME?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In good seasons and bad, there was one constant
with the Dodgers: Three million fans.
</P>
<P>
   They reached that number in Friday night's 3-2 victory over the
Milwaukee Brewers for a major-league record 13th time, but there is
a good chance it might also be the last.
</P>
<P>
   Next season, the club is nearly doubling its television coverage
for home games. The move is designed to generate revenue, but TV
traditionally hurts day-of-game sales and could jeopardize one of
baseball's more prestigious statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been concerns in the past whenever we've made
changes in our television package, but so far we're still at three
million,'' club president Bob Graziano said. ``We've considered
that this time. We used to use television at the start of a home
stand to boost interest. Now we will be televising more games and
think it will expand our fan base.''
</P>
<P>
   Next season, the Dodgers will show a whopping 80 games on Fox
Sports West 2, up from 41 this year. There also will be 50 games on
KTLA Channel 5 in 1999, including 15 home games.
</P>
<P>
   And there will be move next year to add more flexibility to the
club's ticket package that could influence season ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of buying season tickets for 81 games at a cost of
$4-5,000 per year for premium seats between the bases, fans can
pick and choose 10 or 20 games for far less.
</P>
<P>
   Among the packages being considered are a ``Home Run Derby''
theme that includes games with the Sammy Sosa's Chicago Cubs and
Mark McGwire's St. Louis Cardinals. Sosa and McGwire each set the
major league home run record this season.
</P>
<P>
   To make it more attractive, fans also can cancel games in those
packages and receive refunds, something they can't do with season
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Season ticket holder still have the No. 1 consideration on
location, and location is what we've found is the most important
thing to a season ticket holder'' Graziano said.
</P>
<P>
   There were 36,059 at Dodger Stadium on Friday and they saw
right-hander Ismael Valdes allow one unearned run and six hits in
eight innings to close out his season with an 11-10 record.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes, who missed five weeks with a strained left-side muscle,
was coming off a terrible outing in San Francisco last Sunday. He
gave up seven runs and didn't get out of the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   This time, he got home runs from Mark Grudzielanek and rookie
Adrian Beltre after Brewers' left-hander Scott Woodall (7-9) took a
1-0 lead into the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek, who has just two homers in 49 games with the
Dodgers, hit Woodall's first pitch with two outs in the seventh. It
also scored rookie catcher Paul LoDuca, who opened the inning with
a single.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre, playing the final week at third in place of Bobby
Bonilla, opened the eighth by hitting the first pitch from reliever
Al Reyes into the left-field pavilion for his seventh homer.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Shaw replaced Valdes to start the ninth and gave up three
hits, including an RBI single by Jeromy Burnitz. But Shaw recovered
to earn his 47th save, 24th with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Dodgers have not been part of the wild card race
for more than a month, fans still have been watching.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is the season ticket sales, which were at about
20,000 per game this year. The National League counts the number of
tickets sold rather than the number of persons who actually attend,
which often makes announced crowds sound much larger than they
really are.
</P>
<P>
   But the season ticket figure is down from 27,000 in the early
1990s. The Dodgers single season attendance record is 3,608,881,
set in 1982, the year after the club won the World Series. This
season they are fourth in the National League in attendance behind
Colorado, Arizona and Atlanta.

FLOJO SPECULATION IS POINTLESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Florence Griffith Joyner will be laid to rest
today in Lake Forest. Here's hoping all the innuendo surrounding
her death is buried with her.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not her 10-year-old world-record performances in the
100- and 200- meter dashes were fueled by steroids or human growth
hormone is largely irrelevant now.
</P>
<P>
   No finding in the autopsy report is going to bring track's
glamour gal back to life. And let's get real: no coroner's
discovery is going to stem the use of performance-enhancing drugs
in sports.
</P>
<P>
   As long as there is one ego to be pumped and one endorsement
dollar to be pursued, there will be a market for illegal
substances.
</P>
<P>
   Onetime Oakland Raider Lyle Alzado acknowledged that steroid use
contributed to his poor health and yet years after his death,
athletes continue to use the stuff. People know the link between
smoking and cancer and still they insist on lighting up.
</P>
<P>
   It's preposterous to think the death of one woman, even one as
wonderful and charismatic as FloJo, will save people from
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   What if Griffith Joyner used drugs to get faster and they
shortened her life? What difference would that make to the five
dozen U.S. runners polled 10 years ago who were so determined to
dominate they said they'd take a pill to become an Olympic champion
even if they knew it would kill them in five years?
</P>
<P>
   One world-record holder's untimely death at the age of 38 won't
change the mindsets of people who measure their worth in
hundredths-of-a-second and have such a myopic focus that 10 years
might as well be infinity.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will it make the biological clocks of world-class athletes
tick any less emphatically. Time is especially precious for those
who toil in Olympic sports, their careers largely defined by a
fortnight every fourth year.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tough conundrum to crack, having endless dreams and a
fixed horizon. How Griffith Joyner reconciled the two on her way to
becoming the fastest woman on the planet is less important at this
juncture than how the athletes of today and tomorrow go about it.
</P>
<P>
   You can only hope common sense outruns commerce and the
competitive spirit. Anyone who needs a coroner's report to drive
home the point that there are risks in choosing the pharmaceutical
route to glory is proceeding recklessly indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Any further speculation on which path Griffith Joyner took
serves no one and, in fact, hurts the ones who already are in the
most acute pain. Addressing reporters the day after Griffith Joyner
died in her sleep, Bob Kersee, the sprinter's brother-in-law and
former coach, implored people to think of Mary Ruth, the 7-year-old
daughter Griffith Joyner left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``How would you feel if someone was spreading false rumors about
you, and your daughter has to go to school and live with these
things that have not been (proven) factually true?'' Kersee said.
</P>
<P>
   If Griffith Joyner's husband Al, himself an Olympic gold
medal-winning triple jumper, knows something about FloJo that the
rest of us don't, that'll be his cross to bear. It's best now for
us to remember her as someone who rose from the hardscrabble
streets of Watts to become a woman of splendorous style and
substance.
</P>
<P>
   That's how she was portrayed by mourners who flocked to the
Angelus Funeral Home in Los Angeles on Friday to pay their final
respects. People remembered her spectacular performance at the 1988
Olympics in Seoul but reiterated how, even when the world went
bonkers over FloJo, she remained ever-gracious and grounded. She
may have been faster than everybody else, but she never acted
better than anybody.
</P>
<P>
   She taught and titillated us in life. If we learn anything from
her death, may it be to celebrate our own lives as she did hers.
</P>
<P>
   It's high time to look at her death from the same perspective as
hurdler Greg Foster. A close friend of Griffith Joyner, Foster
said, ``The fact that she's gone is sad. How she left us is neither
here nor there at this point.'' &QL;

RED SOX ATTACK WITH REINFORCEMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn ripped his 39th home run early and bombed a double
late. Tim Wakefield earned his career-best 17th win. Mike Stanley
got some needed plate time. Trot Nixon had three hits, Keith
Mitchell a couple. Jimy Williams got to clear his bench in front of
the 34th Fenway Park sellout crowd of the year (32,644).
</P>
<P>
   And, oh yeah, the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox won that, too, beating up the Orioles, 8-3, Friday
night, 24 hours after they'd wrapped up the American League wild
card.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox picked up win No. 91 against 69 losses with their
fourth triumph in a row and fifth in six games on this homestand.
</P>
<P>
   Nomar Garciaparra, John Valentin, Mike Benjamin, and several
others got the night off.
</P>
<P>
   With all wild-card challengers disposed of, the only thing left
to watch on the out-of-town scoreboard _ other than the
Sosa-McGwire updates, of course _ are the games in Minnesota and
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   If the Rangers, who played the Mariners in Seattle, tie
Cleveland, the Red Sox will open the playoffs in Texas Tuesday. If
Central champion Cleveland, which lost in Minnesota, can stay ahead
of the Rangers, the Red Sox open there.
</P>
<P>
   Got all that?
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the Red Sox took advantage of errors by the
Orioles _ who came in playing highly touted defense _ and walks by
Baltimore pitchers, threw in a few timely hits, and now are
threatening to roll into the playoffs with some momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been playing good overall,'' Williams said, ``even when
at times the verdicts have not been in our favor. Basically, that's
what you're looking for, consistency. If we kept pitching good and
playing good defense and you put those three things together _
pitching, defense, and offense at the right time _ you have a very
good chance to win games.''
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield (17-8) took care of the bulk of the pitching, giving
up six hits over six innings, walking none, and striking out five
while exacting a little personal revenge from the Orioles. He had
lost his last three starts against them, most recently a 2-1
decision in July.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Davis led off the game with a single and Wakefield then
retired 11 straight _ mostly on high popups _ before Danny Clyburn
got to him for his first home run in the fourth. By then, the Red
Sox had scored four runs and were in control.
</P>
<P>
   ``The knuckleball felt very good, very consistent,'' Wakefield
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gotta love those popups.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a very good sign,'' Wakefield said. ``They're not
hitting it solid.''
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Jason Varitek concurred: ``You can always tell when his
ball is moving well. You get a lot of popups and bad swings.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles had plenty of both.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn homered in the first inning with Damon Buford on for a
2-0 lead and had a leadoff double in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hit those balls hard,'' said Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. Both were deep to right-center.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn struck out twice in between his hits as his average rose
to .336 in his duel for the batting title with the Yankees' Bernie
Williams, who now leads with a .337 mark.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox brass, who met Friday and likely will confer through
the weekend to shape their playoff roster, may have a little more
to think about after Friday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon had the three hits, a career high, and scored a couple of
runs. Mitchell had a double, a single, and three RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just seeing it and swinging it, nothing big, nothing
major,'' Nixon said. ``We clinched it up last night and went out
there and had some fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley walked three times with little to swing at, reached on a
fielder's choice, and scored twice.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox followed Thursday's 18-hit effort with 11 against
five Oriole pitchers. The Orioles, who had committed 76 errors,
fewest in the majors, coming into the game, had four Friday night.
Their pitchers gave up eight walks.
</P>
<P>
   For Boston, Carlos Valdez, Carlos Reyes, and John Wasdin tossed
an inning apiece of relief. The only hit they allowed was Brady
Anderson's solo home run in the ninth off Wasdin.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox made quick work of Oriole newcomer Chris Fussell. He
was making the second start and third appearance of his career.
</P>
<P>
   It was a short one. He couldn't get out of the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox did most of their damage in the first. Quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Fussell struck out Donnie Sadler to start things off, and it
went downhill for him after that.
</P>
<P>
   Buford walked and Vaughn drilled a 3-1 pitch 420 feet deep to
right-center field, just over the Red Sox bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley walked and scored on Mitchell's grounder later in the
inning. The Sox got another run in the second when they knocked
Fussell out. After the Orioles had cut it to 4-2, Boston came up
with three runs in the fifth to pull away. Mitchell had a
run-scoring double, Varitek and Chris Snopek run-scoring singles.

 McGWIRE QUICKLY TIES UP SOSA  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ They are Coke and Pepsi, Russell and Chamberlain,
Lincoln and Douglas, Ali and Frazier, Burger King and McDonald's.
And with two games left (barring a playoff for the Cubs), Mark
McGwire and Sammy Sosa are tied, each with 66 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   The best moment of Day 160 came at 8:37 CST Friday night when
both Sosa and McGwire were standing in their respective batter's
boxes at the same instant.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa had already homered at the Astrodome to take the lead in
the duel to see which of the two men (if not both) winds up owning
the all-time home run record. Now McGwire, trailing in the Great
Home Run Chase for all of 45 minutes, launched his 66th into the
left-field lower deck at Busch Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever winds up on top, nobody should be disappointed,''
McGwire said after the Cardinals' 6-5 victory over the Expos. ``You
can't. It's impossible. Whatever happens, after the last out on
Sunday, how can you ever think about walking with your head down?''
</P>
<P>
   Heads are high all across the Americas as even casual fans
strain to catch a video clip in an airport lounge or perhaps get
some news from the overhead ticker in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   It is 9 p.m. Has anyone homered yet?
</P>
<P>
   It is never going to get better than this, sports fans. The
greatest baseball season of them all is winding down in
near-perfect fashion. Two days remain _ maybe three for Sammy's
contending Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis manager Tony La Russa, never one given to gimmicks or
frivolity, finally came clean after Friday night's win and admitted
that the Cardinals are now playing with one thing in mind:
McGwire's home run chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was taught that honesty is better,'' said the manager.
``Management may not like this, but as far as I'm concerned, Mark
McGwire and the home run chase is the most important thing in the
next two days.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire seemed embarrassed by the remark. He knows that Sosa _
locked in a wild wild-card chase, is playing for something
altogether different.
</P>
<P>
   There was some thought that McGwire might be done hitting homers
in 1998. He'd cranked No. 65 in Milwaukee Sunday, then was robbed
of No. 66 by a bad umpiring decision. When he spoke with the media
before playing the Expos, he sounded like a man who'd put his bat
in the rack for the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Then Sosa cracked No. 66 in the fourth inning in the Astrodome
while McGwire was stalled at 65. The St. Louis crowd groaned when
the ``66'' went up next to Sosa's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look up there, but I knew,'' said McGwire. ``It's
pretty obvious from the crowd's reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Big Mac didn't stay second for long.
</P>
<P>
   It was the sixth inning in Houston and the fifth in St. Louis
when McGwire came up for his third plate appearance of the night,
his first against Expos righthander Shayne Bennett. A split screen
was needed. Standing in the press box in St. Louis, you didn't know
where to look. Sammy on TV or Mark live and in color?
</P>
<P>
   Happily, Sosa grounded out before McGwire saw his first pitch.
And McGwire didn't get cheated. He ripped at Bennett's first serve
and hit it high and far, into the third deck of Busch. Alas, it was
foul. Barely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was pretty close,'' said McGwire. ``I've had four
or five of those in the last week and I was thinking, `Not
again.'''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire ran the count to 1-2, then ripped another Bennett pitch,
this one fair, over the wall in left.
</P>
<P>
   There was a scramble in Section 282 (another Midwest homey gave
the ball back to McGwire in exchange for an autograph) and bedlam
throughout Busch. The Great Home Run Chase was tied. Again.
</P>
<P>
   How often does a man hit a foul home run, then follow it up with
a fair one? Almost never. Then again, no one ever hit 66 home runs
in a season before this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he hit that thing, I just wanted to stop right there,''
said La Russa. ``It was almost as good as 62'' _ the one that broke
Roger Maris's 37-year-old record.
</P>
<P>
   Truly, if Friday night had been the last night, it would have
been about perfect. But perhaps Saturday will be better than Friday
night. And perhaps Sunday will be better than Saturday. And maybe
Sosa will hit a Bobby Thomson playoff homer Monday to put the Cubs
in the Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   It just keeps getting better. To the finish.

TKACHUK, COYOTES END FEUD  
 1-YEAR EXTENSION SETTLES HOLDOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB McMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Captain Coyote has something to howl about _ and this time, it's
of a positive nature.
</P>
<P>
   After months of on-again, off-again negotiations and some
unflattering name-calling on both sides, Keith Tkachuk and the
Coyotes finally agreed to end their summerlong feud. The team
announced late Friday that it had signed the power forward to a
one-year contract extension, effectively bringing to an end
Tkachuk's 14-day holdout.
</P>
<P>
   Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but it is
believed the team significantly sweetened the final two years of
his current deal, worth $2.8 million this season and $3 million the
next, and then back-loaded the one-year extension with an enormous
salary, worth perhaps as much as $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk, the Coyotes' captain and leading scorer, had been
seeking a three-year extension worth more than $40 million. He told
``The Republic'' this week he would not report to the team unless a
new deal could be reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very pleased to sign Keith to a one-year contract,''
Coyotes General Manager Bobby Smith said in a statement released by
the team. ``Keith is one of the premier power forwards in the game
today and we are excited about having him in the lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal was done after Smith met for several hours in
Minneapolis with Tkachuk and his agent, Bob Murray. Coyotes Owner
Richard Burke also attended the day-long negotiating session.
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk was still in Minneapolis and could not be reached for
comment, but the Coyotes released the following statement from him:
``I am extremely happy to be back with the team. I have always
stated that Phoenix is the city I love and want to play in. Now I
can put this behind me and concentrate on one thing, playing
hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're so glad this is over with and we're coming back to
Phoenix,'' Tkachuk's wife, Chantal, said from the couple's summer
home near Boston. ``Yea! It's a great day! We're both so excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk, the first American-born player to ever record
back-to-back 50-goal seasons, which he accomplished in 1995-96 and
1996-97, is scheduled to practice with the Coyotes Monday morning
at the team's training facility in north Scottsdale. Afterward, he
will appear at a news conference with Smith to discuss the
extension and obviously, the acrimony that came beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the negotiating process, both Tkachuk and Smith
engaged in a war of words. Although it never got particularly
personal or nasty, there were bridges that almost were burned.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Smith infuriated Tkachuk with comments in The
Republic suggesting the Coyotes were a better team without Tkachuk.
``All we've been able to do with Keith Tkachuk is lose in the first
round of the playoffs,'' Smith was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk, who led the team with 40 goals and 66 points last
season, fired back with occasional salvos of his own. Among other
things, he inferred to Smith as a ``rookie GM'' who ``can't make up
his mind,'' and also called him ``a liar'' for not fulfilling what
Tkachuk said was a handshake promise to sign him to a new deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a bad relationship with the guy, but I don't know
if it will ever be the same with him again after some of this
(expletive),'' Tkachuk said last month, when talks broke off for
the umpteenth time.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming he reports to the team in decent shape _ Tkachuk has
said he's been working out daily in Boston _ he likely will
accompany the team to Minneapolis for the Coyotes' preseason game
there against the Dallas Stars on Wednesday.

SOSA SEIZES LEAD WITH 66TH HOMER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ For a guy who essentially conceded the race five days
ago, Sammy Sosa is still doing a pretty good impression of a home
run king.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs slugger temporarily seized the 1998 lead and all-time
record when he hit his 66th homer Friday night. But typical of this
historic duel that has evolved into a game of leapfrog, he soon had
company. Forty-five minutes later in St. Louis, Mark McGwire _ whom
Sosa had declared the likely champion Tuesday when he trailed the
Cardinals slugger by two and was in an 0-for-21 slump _ responded
with his 66th.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa did his damage in the fourth inning of a 6-2 loss to the
playoff-bound Houston Astros. It was the night's only comsolation
for the Cubs, who now find themselves in a three-way tie for the
National League wild card with the Mets and Giants entering the
final weekend of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more the merrier,'' quipped Cubs first baseman Mark Grace.
``We're still out there battling. We got our butts kicked tonight
by Houston. But we've still got a chance, so we'll be back there
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the wild-card race was incidental to the 51,831 fans who
showed up at the Astrodome Friday night. They came to see Sosa go
deep. And he obliged on his second trip to the plate, victimizing
Dominican countryman Jose Lima _ who has given up three of the 66 _
by sending an 0-1 pitch on a 462-foot ride into the third deck of
the left-center-field stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``He broke my bat the first time,'' said Sosa, who went 1 for 4
on the evening. ``But I vowed that I would be patient today. He
threw me an inside fastball and I got a good swing on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa was saluted with a standing ovation that lasted so long, he
finally came out of the dugout for a curtain call. But less than an
hour later, he had company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be still nice if we were tied,'' said Sosa after the
game. ``I feel great that (McGwire) hit 66 tonight. But you can't
say for sure. No matter what happens, Houston is not going to give
us anything.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the second time this season Sosa took over the home run
lead, only to see McGwire erase it before the day was out. On Aug.
19, Sosa hit No. 48. McGwire trumped him with his 48th and 49th.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't seem to bother Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see my face?'' he said, beaming, after Friday night's
game. ``I'm not here to chase anybody. I'm here to do my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Some have wondered whether Lima, Sosa's close friend, is making
that job easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are friends,'' said Sosa before the game. ``But not on the
ball field.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he paid tribute to Lima, who wound up going seven
innings for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to give credit to Lima,'' said Sosa. ``I got him once.
He got me. He pitched a great game. I don't like losing. But it's a
great situation to be in _ to have a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Cubs manager Jim Riggleman applauded his right fielder for
trying to lead the charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tough challenge for Sosa,'' he said. ``The team and
all the city of Chicago are indebted for what he's done. We're
happy he got another one. But as a team, we're really more focused
on the score of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   In a pregame media session, Sosa had more than home runs on his
mind. He used the forum to plead for financial assistance for
victims of Hurricane Georges, which has ravaged Puerto Rico, Cuba,
and the Dominican. Sosa gave more than lip service to the cause. In
conjunction with the Cubs, he announced that donations would be
accepted for the Sammy Sosa Charity Foundation to help sponsor a
relief effort. Additionally, he announced that if he was able to
gain possession of home run ball No. 62, with which he became the
second man to break Roger Maris's 37-year-old record, he would put
it up for auction, with all the proceeds going to the victims.

<P>
   OAKLAND _ Not many teams pop open the champagne bottles after a
15-4 defeat, but the Texas Rangers did Friday night. And they had
the Oakland A's to thank for it.
</P>
<P>
   Because the A's beat the Angels 7-2 before 22,861 at the Oakland
Coliseum, the Rangers were able to celebrate the AL West crown in
the eighth inning of their blowout loss to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, who swept three from the Angels in Anaheim prior to
the season-ending four-game series, are three games up on the
Angels with two to play.
</P>
<P>
   It was exasperating for the Angels to watch the scoreboard as
the Mariners opened up a big lead on the Rangers. The Angels
couldn't do anything with A's starter Kenny Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers (16-8) pitched his seventh complete game of the season,
more than double that of the entire Angels staff (three). He gave
up seven hits, walked two and struck out six, improving to 11-0 at
home this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was taunting us,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said of the
scoreboard. ``The bigger lead (Seattle) got, the more frustrated we
got, certainly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if there's any consolation in us winning and
Texas winning (instead). I don't think that helps the situation
out. We've had a remarkable year in a lot of ways. A lot of people
stepped up. The team did things nobody expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly people will say it was another year we couldn't get
it done at the end. I disagree with that. We got a lot of things
from a lot of people. We're disappointed, but we're professionals.
What we do now is regroup and take a look at what we need to do to
get better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels could manage only a two-run double by Troy Glaus in
the fifth inning off Rogers, frustrating them and leaving them
empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's over and it's not a good feeling,'' said Darin Erstad,
who did not play Friday. ``We didn't get the job done. There are
two reasons why you play _ to play hard and to win. And if you
don't win, I don't consider that getting the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a somber moment,'' Tim Salmon said. ``The possibility (of
winning the division) was very real. We played hard for seven
months or whatever it was, and all of a sudden you aren't playing
for anything anymore. It's kind of sad now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels fell behind early, making their task at hand even
more difficult. The A's took a 4-0 lead after four innings against
Angels starter Omar Olivares (9-9).
</P>
<P>
   The Angels cut it to 4-2 in the fifth on Glaus' double, but that
was as close as they'd get. Ben Grieve doubled in two in the fifth
and A.J. Hinch singled in the A's final run in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers became the first pitcher to go 11-0 at home in a season
since Orel Hershiser did it for the Dodgers in 1985, and the first
American League pitcher ever to go undefeated at home with a
minimum of 11 decisions. The major-league record is 12-0 by Billy
Pierce of the Giants in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers has been tough on the Angels throughout his career. He's
2-0 this year and 11-5 in his career, including a perfect game
while he pitched for the Rangers in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's anything to be ashamed about,'' Olivares
said. ``We gave it our all for 160 games and came pretty close. In
our hearts we know we gave it all we had. I'm going to go home
feeling proud of what I did and what everyone in this room did.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to some players today and one thing that was brought
up is it's not just the games this month that are important, it's
the games all year long,'' Collins said. ``You have to realize
games in April and May are just as important as September. As I was
walking around today I heard guys talking about different games
that got away early in the year. But I'm real proud of them. We'll
be back. I still think we've got good young players and we'll be in
it for a long time.''

BIN LADEN GROUP TRIED TO DEVELOP NUCLEAR WEAPONS, U.S. SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs for additions and refinements.)   (See related: KENYA-BOMBING)  
(lh) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal authorities said Friday that a man they described as a
senior deputy to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile suspected in last
month's bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa, tried on behalf
of the bin Laden group in 1993 to obtain materials that could be
used to develop nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, the authorities cited a document that they related
to a proposed purchase of enriched uranium. But they did not say
whether the group ever obtained the uranium.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the nuclear allegation, the authorities asserted that
the bin Laden group had worked with Iran and with the Sudanese
ruling party to oppose the United States, and they suggested that
the United States had penetrated the bin Laden organization in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations are contained in court papers unsealed Friday
that accused Mamdouh Mahmud Salim of conspiracy to murder and to
use weapons of mass destruction against Americans stationed outside
the United States, in Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   Salim was arrested in Munich, Germany, about 10 days ago, after
flying there from Sudan, and Washington said Friday that it would
seek his extradition.
</P>
<P>
   In the court papers, the government also asserted for the first
time that there was a ``working agreement'' among bin Laden, Iran
and the National Islamic Front of Sudan to ``work together against
the United States, Israel and the West.'' The front is the ruling
party in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Members of bin Laden's organization, Al Qaeda, sent emissaries
to Iran and some of its members received explosives training in
Lebanon from Hezbollah, the terrorist group backed by Iran,
prosecutors said in court papers filed in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The government also said that during the time when the agreement
with Iran and Sudan was reportedly being negotiated, Salim _ who is
described in the document as one of the founders of Al Qaeda _ met
with an Iranian religious official in Khartoum and traveled with Al
Qaeda members to Teheran to arrange for training in the use of
explosives.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations against Iran come at a sensitive time because
Afghanistan has reportedly given bin Laden a safe haven, and Iran
and the Taliban rulers in Afghanistan are at loggerheads about
Iran's support for armed militias opposing the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint against Salim was signed by an FBI agent, Daniel
J. Coleman, and was approved by two federal prosecutors, Patrick J.
Fitzgerald and Kenneth M. Karas, and was signed by a federal
magistrate judge on Sept. 14. Any indictment based on the complaint
must be approved by a grand jury.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In unsealing the charges against Salim, who is being held in
Germany pending his extradition. U.S. authorities suggested that
the investigation of bin Laden and Al Qaeda continues on two
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   One is focused on the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania on Aug. 7, in which more than 250 people were killed,
including 12 Americans in Nairobi. Bin Laden's agents are suspected
in the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The other track is directed at bin Laden's organization itself
and its possible role in other acts of terrorism, like the attacks
on U.S. and U.N. forces in Somalia in 1993 and early 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities also said Friday that as early as 1996, the FBI
had won the cooperation of a person who described himself as a
terrorist in Al Qaeda and obtained extensive information from him
about the group.
</P>
<P>
   The source was not identified, but was described in court papers
as ``a member of Al Qaeda for a number of years'' and ``personally
familiar'' with bin Laden and Salim. The document said the person
``has admitted to participating in terrorist activity against
American interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that description, there was no information about whether
the Government had actually penetrated the group and won the
cooperation of an active member, or whether the source had left Al
Qaeda.
</P>
<P>
   The document says that information from this source was provided
to the FBI in 1996, raising questions about how much the government
knew about the bin Laden group before the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph A. Valiquette, a spokesman for the FBI in New York, said
he could not comment beyond what was in the court complaint.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint indicates how much the authorities have learned
about Al Qaeda's history and command. The document says that bin
Laden's group is highly organized and includes a majlis al shura,
or consultation council, which discusses and approves all major
undertakings, including terrorist operations and fatwas, which are
death sentences against anyone who is found to have offended Islam.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities did not specify when bin Laden's group reached
its agreement with Iran and the Sudanese party, saying only that
the arrangement was made while Al Qaeda was based in Sudan, between
1991 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Citing information from the confidential source, the authorities
said that as early as 1992, bin Laden and other ranking members of
Al Qaeda decided that the group ``should put aside its differences
with Shiite Muslim terrorist organizations, including the
government of Iran and its affiliated terrorist group Hezbollah, to
cooperate against its perceived common enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Al Qaeda members also began to provide training to
Somali tribes opposed to the United Nation's role there, the
complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Friday night how the allegations of Iranian
involvement with bin Laden would affect U.S. policy toward Iran,
particularly as Iran moves to improve its relations with the West.
</P>
<P>
   It is evident that the United States has had the Iranian
information since 1996, when the confidential source first provided
the information to the bureau, the complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   Such allegations come at a time when Washington is rounding up
people associated with the suspected network of bin Laden, yet is
eager not to provoke new acts of terrorism. It is apprehensive
about retaliation after the missile strikes against bin Laden's
camps in Afghanistan and a suspected chemical weapons plant in
Sudan.

   Prosecutors are said to have named bin Laden in a sealed
indictment last spring on terrorist charges. The authorities
asserted Friday that bin Laden privately encouraged associates to
make specific attacks against U.S. military forces in Africa and
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first indication that bin Laden issued such orders
directly to his associates, rather than through widely publicized
fatwas against the United States. Prosecutors may be moving closer
to being able to show that he ordered the embassy attacks as well.

 Griffey hits HR milestone in M's win, but Texas clinches  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Ken Griffey Jr. might appreciate you more than you
think.
</P>
<P>
   Draped along the facing of the right-field second deck on Fan
Appreciation Night at the Kingdome was a bull's-eye surrounded by
the words ``Hit It Here, Junior.''
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth inning, Griffey did that one tier better, punishing
the first pitch from Texas Rangers reliever Eric Gunderson into the
third deck to make him the youngest player in major legue history
to reach 350 career home runs. The three-run blast was the
highlight for 39,325 fans who saw the M's beat Texas, 15-4.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night wasn't a total loss for the Rangers, though. They
clinched their second American League West title in three years
thanks to a 7-2 loss in Oakland by the second-place Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   At age 28 years and 308 days, Griffey put himself ahead of seven
Hall of Famers on the fastest-to-350 track. The second-youngest is
Jimmie Foxx (29 years, 216 days) and the next six are Eddie
Mathews, Mickey Mantle, Mel Ott, Hank Aaron, Frank Robinson and
Harmon Killebrew. The fewest career homers any of them hit was
Ott's 511.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are things you don't really think about doing,'' Griffey
said. ``You don't sit at home when you're a kid and say, `I want to
hit 350 faster than anybody.' You just want to go out there and
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't thinking about hitting a home run in that situation,
because I knew Gar (Edgar Martinez) was behind me and he needed one
(run batted in to reach 100). I got to home plate, turned around,
looked at Gar and said, `I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been doing it all year,'' Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez got that 100th RBI on a double in the eighth inning,
giving him at least 100 in each of the past four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks better than 99,'' Martinez said. ``So I wanted to get
it. It was important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   And though he didn't grow up dreaming of it, the 350th homer was
meaningful to Griffey, too. It bounced out of the stands and back
onto the field, and Griffey pointed for it during his trot.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to keep it, but said he probably would not hand it
over to the Hall of Fame if Cooperstown came calling. That's
4-year-old Trey Griffey's call.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family comes first,'' Griffey said. ``I'll probably end up
giving that one to Trey. I'll ask him tomorrow morning when he gets
up.''
</P>
<P>
   The ball will be a get-well gift for the junior Junior, who is
fine but still smarting after being hit in the head with a golf
club on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Family, after all, matters more to Griffey than his milestones.
Of all his September achievements, Griffey said the one that links
him with his father is the most important. His 54th homer on
Thursday, which gave him 500 combined with Ken Sr., ``stands out
the most.''
</P>
<P>
   But the other stuff isn't bad. Since Sept. 7, Griffey has become
the third player in history with consecutive 50-homer seasons, the
third to couple 50 homers with 20 stolen bases and the third with
three consecutive 140-RBI seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's homer also tied a record Griffey already shared with
fellow Donora, Pa., native Stan Musial. It was Griffey's 21st off a
left-handed pitcher, tying the season mark for a left-handed hitter
set by Musial in 1949 and equaled by Griffey in '96.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the family connection: Griffey hits left-handers so well
because he grew up taking batting practice off his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad's left-handed,'' Griffey said. ``So I had no idea there
was a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey also got his wish to have the Rangers celebrate a
division title in their clubhouse, not on his field.
</P>
<P>
   Winning by losing is a familiar thing for the Rangers, who also
did it in 1996. The Rangers were in the midst of a 15-inning loss
in '96 when they found out they had won the first title in their
25-year history courtesy of a loss by the second-place M's.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't stop the spirits from flowing in the visiting
clubhouse. The Rangers, who trailed the Angels for much of the
summer, won eight of their last 10 before Friday's clinching.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perseverance of this ballclub,'' said Rangers manager
Johnny Oates, pointing to his team's greatest strength. ``It just
seemed like we never really got it going. We'd win two or three
games in a row, then we'd lose two or three. (But) here at the end,
we persevered and got close and finally got it going.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   When he went before religious leaders at the White House two
weeks ago, President Clinton admitted to having sinned in his
relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   As most people surely know by now, Ms. Lewinsky said in her
grand jury testimony that she performed oral sex on Clinton. At
least once, by her account, their talk apparently touched on what a
Higher Authority might expect from Clinton. That was on May 24,
1997, when Clinton moved to break off the relationship. The
president, she said, seemed to be ``just really wanting to do the
right thing in God's eyes'' and for his family.
</P>
<P>
   But what exactly was the sin he had committed? In his legal
defenses, the president has tried to distinguish between ``sexual
relations'' and oral sex. That isn't a distinction most Americans
might make, and it certainly isn't one the Bible focuses on in
defining sexual sin.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Bible does single out adultery for
special attention in the 10 Commandments _ but defines it in a way
that might surprise many people.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans would probably say that regardless of what
happened between Ms. Lewinsky and the president, he committed
adultery, which they understand to mean breaking the marital vows.
Clinton probably added to that view by making reference at the
prayer breakfast to a passage from the 51st Psalm, a cry of
repentance attributed to King David after the king was rebuked by
the prophet Nathan for having had sexual intercourse with a married
woman, Bathsheba.
</P>
<P>
   But from a biblical standpoint, could the Clinton-Lewinsky
relationship be described as adultery, an act that the Old
Testament defines narrowly?
</P>
<P>
   Or would it be better described under the general term of sexual
immorality, keeping in mind that Scripture is short on specific
references to any number of sexual acts, oral sex among them?
</P>
<P>
   Consider how some modern dictionaries treat the subject.
Webster's New World College Dictionary, for example, defines
adultery as ``voluntary sexual intercourse'' between a married
person and someone not his or her spouse.
</P>
<P>
   The Old Testament is more precise. Leviticus 20:10, which
prescribes the death penalty for adulterers, speaks of a man ``that
committeth adultery with another man's wife.'' So adultery meant
sexual intercourse between a man and a married woman not his wife.
</P>
<P>
   As the magisterial Anchor Bible Dictionary (Doubleday, 1992)
puts it, the man's marital status was ``inconsequential since only
the married or betrothed woman'' was ``bound to fidelity.'' The
prohibition was not so much about a husband's feelings as about
knowing who had fathered a baby. Thus, it worked to safeguard
issues of family succession and property rights.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Rabbi Robert Harris, an assistant professor of
Bible at Jewish Theological Seminary, said that what is considered
morally wrong regarding marital sexual relations has obviously
grown since the Five Books of Moses were written down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live according to an inherited body of tradition, which has
expanded the biblical norms,'' Harris said, adding that
``conventional modern understanding'' of adultery is based on a
broader rejection of marital infidelity. ``We have a more
egalitarian society than the Bible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clergy members say too that the overall sexual ethic expounded
by the Bible demands fidelity within marriage, with no loophole
clauses.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Robert Friday, a professor of religion and vice
president for student life at Catholic University of America, said
that were he to have a talk with Clinton about his relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky, ``I'd say it didn't have to be sexual
intercourse'' to constitute adultery, much less sex.
</P>
<P>
   Oral sex, for example, would be ``a violation of your covenant
promise to Hillary,'' Friday said he would say. ``So, in that way,
it's very much adultery.''
</P>
<P>
   People familiar with Southern Baptist life say it is most
unlikely that Clinton encountered a legalistic approach to adultery
in the Sunday School classes of his youth. ``The Southern Baptist
tradition has meticulously avoided particular biblical references
to human sexuality, and spoken very broadly against pre-marital and
extra-marital sexuality,'' said Robert Parham, executive director
of the Baptist Center for Ethics in Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   In the New Testament gospels, some of Jesus' statements are
understood to extend the definition of adultery to include
infidelity by a married man. And the term fornication is broadly
used to describe sexual activity outside marriage, with a warning
of spiritual punishment to come to the unrepentant. In 1
Corinthians 6:9-10, Paul lists fornicators as among those groups
who will ``not inherit the Kingdom of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Parham noted, however, that ``the Bible is not a sex manual.''
The Bible, he said, ``gives us broad values and stories that are to
inform our moral behavior.''

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Michael Leavitt was visiting California from Utah a
few months back, and while staying at a beach house used his laptop
computer to shop over the Internet. He accessed a website, made his
selections and charged the bill _ $44.50 plus $2.49 for shipping _
to his credit card.
</P>
<P>
   But he did not pay sales tax. That bothered him because, as
governor of Utah, Leavitt is acutely aware of how reliant states
are on sales taxes. And he has given considerable thought to the
looming problems _ for states, the economy and consumers _ of
relying on traditional tax systems in a world in which Internet
commerce is starting to change the way people shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which states could logically and reasonably have argued that
they should receive the benefits of that tax?'' Leavitt asked about
his purchase. ``California? I was sitting in California when I made
the transaction. New York? New York was where the home page was
resident and where the company was located. But the goods were
packaged and shipped from a warehouse in New Jersey, and they were
shipped to Utah, where I used them.''
</P>
<P>
   Governments have long grappled with how, if at all, they should
regulate the global flow of images and information over the
Internet, seeking to balance concerns about free speech, for
example, with those about pornography. But only recently have
policy-makers in Washington, in state capitals and around the world
begun to confront the economic implications of a new retail
marketplace that recognizes no political or geographical
boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Almost by the day, the new medium is showing its potential for
rapid growth. At Amazon.com, the online bookseller, the latest
chapter in President Clinton's woes led to a surge of orders for
the book version of Kenneth Starr's report to Congress and then for
the video of Clinton's grand jury appearance (both briefly topped
Stephen King's latest on the company's best seller list). Catalog
companies are increasingly giving customers the option to place
orders over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a major economic force here,'' said Ira Magaziner,
who heads the Clinton administration's Internet policy team. ``It's
just beginning to reach the consumer, and it's going to be huge.
The question is, how do we create an environment that will allow it
to flourish and also will take care of all the side effects that
will arise?''
</P>
<P>
   The issues are sweeping. Where does a transaction take place
when buyer and seller can be defined to be in multiple locations?
Will the borderless nature of the Internet force governments
further down a road that has already led them to drop trade
barriers, harmonize tax policies and form currency unions?
</P>
<P>
   On a more immediate level, many governors and state legislatures
are convinced that such commerce will present in greatly magnified
form the same problem they have faced for years with the L.L. Beans
of the world that sell by phone and mail from catalogs: Although
consumers are technically liable for sales taxes, companies have to
collect taxes only in states where they keep a physical presence.
Although some merchants collect the tax even where they are not
required to do so, most do not.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble's barnesandnoble.com, another online bookseller,
automatically adds sales tax to orders being shipped to New York,
where it has its corporate headquarters; New Jersey, where it has
its distribution center, and Virginia, where its computer operation
is based. Orders elsewhere go untaxed.
</P>
<P>
   The lost revenue for states is relatively trivial now, but could
mount substantially in coming years as the volume of business on
the Internet grows. Though estimates vary widely, some analysts see
the electronic market growing to hundreds of billions of dollars
annually within the next decade, from next to nothing a few years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   By early in the next decade, states could be losing up to $12
billion a year, according to the National Governors' Association.
That would be a big chunk of state sales tax revenue, which last
year totaled $150 billion, and would be three times what states say
they lose each year because of out-of-state mail-order purchases.
</P>
<P>
   The states are also under pressure from traditional retailers,
who see their Internet competitors as operating in a tax-free zone
that will draw customers away from Main Street and the mall.
</P>
<P>
   From the perspective of technology companies and online service
providers, the issue is whether they will become a tempting target
for new taxes, or the object of discriminatory policies intended to
benefit traditional retailers. A tax free-for-all, they and their
supporters warn, will stifle the new marketplace and deny its
economic benefits to the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is incumbent upon us to get it right so that we do not
allow a feeding frenzy by state and local tax collectors across the
world to turn the information superhighway into an empty
21st-century toll road,'' said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts suggested the problem can be solved by an agreement
among the states to levy taxes based on residence and then creating
software that would automatically add the appropriate amount to any
Internet purchase as part of the credit card billing process.
</P>
<P>
   Such a system could also automatically route the tax to the
proper state.
</P>
<P>
   But getting the balance right between nurturing the new medium
and not hurting states and traditional retailers is no easy
proposition.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, the Senate is debating a bill cosponsored by Wyden
that would establish a two-year moratorium on any new taxes that
would treat Internet commerce differently from traditional
retailing, while establishing a commission to sort out the sales
tax issue. A similar bill passed the House in June.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's increasing interest has made the states nervous.
Some governors fear that the growth of Internet commerce will
encourage the federal government to create and administer a
consistent sales tax system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IRS will say, we'll collect it, and Congress will say,
we'll appropriate it,'' said Leavitt, a Republican. ``We'll have
taxes now collected and spent by local governments collected and
spent by the federal government. That's a massive shift in power.''
</P>
<P>
   Another concern in the technology industry and in Washington is
that other countries could slap duties, tariffs or other trade
barriers on international Internet transactions, either to raise
revenue or protect their domestic industries, and create new taxes
for transactions within their borders. The Clinton administration
has already raised the issue at the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governments around the world are beginning to understand the
power of this medium, and it's something a lot of people are
wrestling with,'' said Ben Boyd, a spokesman for
barnesandnoble.com. ``It's a new medium and you need to look at
everything through new lenses.''

   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's admitted immoral behavior has
thrust to the forefront a fundamental question about the meaning of
the American presidency: Should the president be a moral leader?
And if so, what is a moral leader?
</P>
<P>
   Contrasting themselves with Clinton, candidates around the
country are declaring that they are virtue personified. They are
emphasizing their families and the values by which they live. They
are making the point, in essence, that moral leaders are role
models.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for some politicians, the definition of a moral leader has
little to do with personal rectitude, with fearing God, being
faithful to a spouse or abjuring untruths and devious business
practices. They say the moral leader is the one who seizes upon the
power of high office to enact policies that clarify national ideals
and to inspire the people, summoning society to greatness.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln was famous for both. He steered the nation through the
Civil War, boldly fought to free the slaves and was not bashful
about pressing against perceived public opinion. Personally, he was
Honest Abe, and also a man so modest and unassuming that he wrote
shortly before he was first elected, ``I do not think myself fit
for presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   But the ability to combine personal purity with the political
skills to lead the nation toward larger civic accomplishments has
eluded most presidents. Given the choice, Americans these days
appear willing to put up with a leader who has personal flaws, even
serious ones.
</P>
<P>
   In a nationwide New York Times/CBS News Poll conducted last
week, only 21 percent of the public said it was most important that
presidents serve as moral role models; 65 percent said it was more
important that presidents do their job well.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an ideal world, the president would be the paragon of
virtue,'' said former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, a Democrat. ``The
reality is that no human has been able to reach the ideal of
leadership in which they reflect the best of virtue all the time.
We don't trust politicians to be our moral arbiter. We'd like them
to be. But we don't expect it.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Mike Mansfield, D-Mont., a longtime Senate majority
leader, argued that there cannot help but be diminished
expectations in an age when presidents face great scrutiny. After
all, today they are expected to reveal the type of underwear they
prefer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time when people expected presidents to be
Superman,'' said Mansfield, who is 95. ``But that time is long
gone. The presidency and the people are now being drawn closer and
closer together due to the media. No president is on the pedestal
any more.''
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean that people no longer yearn for leaders whom
they view as beyond reproach. Still, most people probably look for
the qualities that they most desire at the moment. With the economy
humming along and the nation secure, there is probably no special
demand for inspiring leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Graff, a professor emeritus of history at Columbia
University, said ``the wheel of history has to turn fortuitously''
for a president to have the opportunity to exhibit moral
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know whether a person is a moral leader unless they
have something to lead for,'' he said. ``Wars and depressions are
good places to show off leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Herbert Hoover, for example, was so scrupulously honest that he
did not collect his salary as president. (He was also a
millionaire.) But his efforts to be a moral leader were spoiled by
the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few presidents who is widely regarded as a true moral
leader during a time of peace was Theodore Roosevelt, who from his
``bully pulpit'' preached again and again about honesty in
government.
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk of integrity, some people may not be more
comfortable with a president who commands the same personal respect
as, say, a member of the clergy. To reach the highest elective
office, a person, no matter how upright in public, has to be a
master at the inherently devious game of politics.
</P>
<P>
   A common perception is that politicians who are too clean may
find it too distasteful to do some of the unsavory things that a
president must do, like outmaneuver political opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't necessarily want them to be Mother Teresa _ We don't
necessarily want them to be pure as can be,'' said Thomas Cronin,
an authority on American presidents who is also the president of
Whitman College in Walla Walla, Wash. ``The world of international
affairs requires a toughness of demeanor.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a rich history of presidents who, personally, were
viewed as beyond reproach but never accomplished much for the
country. Just the same, presidents considered rogues are viewed as
successful moral leaders.
</P>
<P>
   While known for his Christian principles, Woodrow Wilson's
naivete in dealing with the European powers helped set the stage
for World War II, and his off-putting aloofness disposed the nation
to elect the more genial, and flawed, Warren Harding as his
successor. After Harding's death in 1923, his vice president,
Calvin Coolidge, succeeded him and restored respectability to a
White House blackened by Teapot Dome and other scandals. ``Cautious
Cal'' was a New England Calvinist known for his morality, honesty
and frugality. But he was also conspicuously shy, a wooden speaker
and failed to win passage of much of his legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, John F. Kennedy has been remembered for having
endless trysts. While his unfaithfulness wasn't generally known at
the time, his virility enhanced his stature then and, more
important, still does to some extent today. Lyndon B. Johnson,
himself no exemplar of marital fidelity, had an admired reputation
for effective leadership that owed much to the fact that he was a
dirty political infighter.
</P>
<P>
   No one ever questioned the uprightness of President Gerald R.
Ford or his successor, Jimmy Carter, who in the 1976 campaign
presented himself as an antidote to the dishonesty of government in
the Watergate era. ``I don't intend to break a single promise,'' he
vowed in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all his trustworthiness, Carter was never able to parlay
his personal character into effective championing of larger
societal values during his tenure. And neither Ford nor Carter has
been viewed as particularly effective presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Just about any president would be considered downright charming,
and virtuous, if compared with Andrew Jackson, a dictatorial,
nasty, temperamental man who always seemed to find himself facing
down an opponent in a duel with a pistol. But that did not prevent
Jackson from earning a place in history as a respectable president
symbolizing abiding national values.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And Franklin D. Roosevelt, the president viewed by many as
America's most effective moral leader this century _ revered even
as he forced Americans to make huge personal sacrifices in the
Depression and in World War II _ was hardly a role model in private
life. He engaged in a years-long clandestine affair with Lucy
Mercer, a former social secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Decades later, Richard M. Nixon, in his first inaugural address,
tried to muster the American spirit by invoking God repeatedly and
declaring, ``We can build a great cathedral of the spirit.'' Nixon,
of course, became the first president to be forced from office
because of ethical misdeeds, although many people still insist that
he was an effective leader, particularly in foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Moral leadership is often in the eye of the beholder. Mansfield,
for one, said he considers Harry Truman the last true moral leader
in the White House because he combined high ethics in his private
and public life. Yet despite the moniker ``Honest Harry,'' Truman
never could completely shake off the taint of his ties to the
suspect Missouri political machine of Tom Pendergast. And Truman
was not particularly popular when he was president; only recently
have historians portrayed him as a heroic figure.
</P>
<P>
   William Kristol, a Republican whose magazine, The Weekly
Standard, promotes the view that moral leadership is more than
personal conduct, said Ronald Reagan was the last truly moral
leader. ``Reagan really had a certain personal dignity,'' he said.
``It was a great moral achievement of Reagan that he won the Cold
War. And that depended on his having his own personal moral
grounding in his belief that he really was right.''
</P>
<P>
   But others cited Reagan's poor relations with his children and
contrasted his expressions of devoutness with his failure to attend
church regularly. ``He could make the lofty statement on the beach
on the anniversary of D-Day,'' Graff said. ``But there was a
feeling that there was something not quite real about him. He
didn't stand 20-feet tall.''
</P>
<P>
   The most blatant distinction between a president's personal
morals and public values was drawn by Democratic National Committee
national chairman Steve Grossman speaking, as Clinton looked on, at
a recent fund-raising event in New York. ``Mr. President,'' he
said, ``it seems to me that you have demonstrated, at least in my
adult lifetime, a higher commitment to the kind of moral leadership
that I value in public service and public policy than any person I
have ever met.''
</P>
<P>
   That tribute was hotly disputed by Republicans; even some
Democrats in the room at the time rolled their eyes. With
characteristic understatement, former Sen. Bob Dole, who was
defeated by Clinton in the 1996 campaign, said, ``The DNC chairman,
I think, went overboard.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, and even many Democrats, these days prefer the
definition of a moral leader as a role model. Republican Party
officials contend that the personal values of candidates have
eclipsed everything else as the most crucial issue in the November
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Former Vice President Dan Quayle, who is considering a run for
the White House in 2000, volunteered on national TV recently that
he had not had an extramarital affair. At a convention of the
Christian Coalition the other day, another Republican contender,
Steve Forbes, allied himself with Teddy Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been drawn to him because he understood the enormous
power of the American presidency to shape our culture, not simply
through the force of laws but through the power of persuasion,''
Forbes said of Roosevelt, adding, ``Like Ronald Reagan, he had a
compass and a core.''
</P>
<P>
   But the danger of campaigning on moral authority is that
Republicans risk being viewed as considering themselves
holier-than-thou. ``There has to be a very delicate calibration in
calling for moral leadership without appearing to be haughty or
self-righteous,'' said Ralph Reed, a Republican strategist and the
Christian Coalition's former executive director. ``The challenge is
more on the Republican side to affirm rather than condemn, to
elevate right behavior rather than attack wrong behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   When Carter ran for president, he did not repudiate Nixon and
Ford as much as he tried to promote the general healing of the
nation. Some Republican strategists said they feared that Sen. John
Ashcroft, R-Mo., who may run for president in 2000, was skating at
the line of appropriateness when he said, ``We have a president who
views a vulnerable woman from the perspective of a predator.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself was asked the other day if he had the moral
authority to lead the nation. ``That is something you have to
demonstrate every day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That will not be easy. ``He was probably at his peak when he
could stand up and talk about family values,'' said Leon Panetta,
Clinton's former chief of staff. ``Now it would not be wise for him
to talk about values except in the sense of contrition and the
personal pain he's been through.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even if he avoids the subject, kindling a national debate
over morality in government may be Clinton's lasting legacy.

   KENYA-BOMB-SUSPECT (Nairobi, Kenya) _ His business card said he
was the director of Africa Help, a nongovernmental relief
organization, and he told friends that he supplemented his income
by trading in precious stones. That was the public face here of
Wahid el Hage. Out of the public eye, according to recent federal
indictments, el Hage was a leader in the Kenyan branch of a
terrorist organization, Al Queda, which is run by Osama bin Laden,
the man believed to be the mastermind behind last month's bombings
of the American Embassies here and in neighboring Tanzania. By
Raymond Bonner.
</P>
<P>
   BALKAN-PEACE-BRIGADE (Skopje, Macedonia) _ Seven southeastern
European countries agreed Saturday to create a multinational
military force that could be used for peacekeeping or aid
operations in the Balkans and elsewhere. By Steven Lee Myers.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY-CHANGE (Berlin) _ Change is not lightly accepted in a
country where stability is paramount, and as Germany prepares to
vote Sunday in national elections it appears gripped by last-minute
doubts over whether the time has come to end the era of Chancellor
Helmut Kohl. For months, Kohl has trailed his Social Democratic
challenger, Gerhard Schroeder But with a relentless conviction,
Kohl has closed the gap to the point where pollsters say any
outcome is possible. By Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-BANKS (Tokyo) _ Japan's governing party and the opposition
patched up a basic agreement Saturday on legislation to revive the
banking system. The latest agreement, if it sticks, may dispel
concerns that Japan's political paralysis will continue to hobble
its economy. By Sheryl WuDunn.
</P>
<P>
   SAFRICA-LESOTHO (Johannesburg, South Africa _ Probably the
biggest blunder South Africa made in invading the tiny kingdom of
Lesotho on Tuesday was a military one _ sending fewer than half the
soldiers it ultimately needed. But it is hard to say; the list of
blunders is so long. An analysis. By Suzanne Daley.
</P>
<P>
   MACAU-CHINA (Macau) _ For years, the looming reversion of this
Portuguese colony to China has been little remarked on and largely
forgotten _ a bit of colonial housekeeping lost in the wake of Hong
Kong's momentous handover from Britain. But now, this other
handover is suddenly generating some drama of its own. By Mark
Landler.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-LOGGING-BAN (Lixian, China) _ Stunned by this summer's
devastating floods along the Yangtze River, which experts said were
intensified because slopes far upstream had been stripped bare,
China has banned cutting of the old-growth forests that once formed
a rich green carpet over these mountains. No trees were to be cut
after Sept. 1, and all logs must be trucked to timber yards by Oct.
31. By Erik Eckholm.
</P>

U.N. survey. By Christopher S. Wren.

   NATIONAL (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   HEDGEFUND-MERIWETHER _ Wall Street, often hard-nosed and
cynical, was utterly dazzled by John Meriwether. He was viewed as a
bond trader with a Midas touch, a mathematician of genius who saw
gold nuggets in markets where others saw only sand. So when
Long-Term Capital fell from grace last week, that the glittering
Meriwether image toppled with it. By Diana B. Henriques.
</P>
<P>
   AUTO-INSURE-LAWSUIT (Washington) _ When Mark Covington drives
his 1992 Chevy Cavalier at night, the beam of the left headlight
wobbles across the road, and in daylight, the red paint on the hood
shows an odd ridge on the left side. He blames his insurance
company: After his wife crashed the car into the back of a pickup
in April, he said, he took the car to one of the best body shops in
Laurel, Miss., but the shop had to use generic parts. ``State Farm
just absolutely refused to put GM parts on it,'' Covington said.
Lawyers are seeking to add him to a large class-action suit against
State Farm. By Matthew L. Wald.
</P>
<P>
   HEART-STUDY-GALA (Framingham, Mass.) _ If all the Americans who
owe some of the length or quality of their lives to the Framingham
Heart Study were to express their gratitude by attending its 50th
anniversary gala on Sunday afternoon, the auditorium would need
millions upon millions of folding chairs. By Carey Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   COLO-HOUSE-RACE (Boulder, Colo.) _ Could Boulder, the liberal
lighthouse of the Rockies, send to Congress _ a Republican? For
nearly a quarter century, Colorado's Second District has been a
safe seat for Democrats. But now the Republicans have fielded
Robert D. Greenlee, a moderate who favors abortion rights and
enjoys a wide following as Boulder's first Republican Mayor since
1971. For the Democrats, Mark Udall, who is in his first term as a
state representative, is mounting what appears to be an equally
strong candidacy. By James Brooke.
</P>
<P>
   FOREIGN-STUDENTS _ American colleges and universities, long the
world leaders in attracting international students, are seeing the
decline of their dominance, government analysts and education
officials reported on Thursday at a conference in Washington. By
William H. Honan.
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON-COURTHOUSE (Boston) _ The new federal courthouse that
opened for business on a spectacular waterfront site here last week
is in many ways the first of its kind in modern judicial
architecture: a building designed to welcome rather than
intimidate, to invite the public to stop by for a meal, an art
exhibit, a film festival, a chamber music concert or a stroll
through the new two-acre ``harbor park'' that surrounds the
building. By Linda Greenhouse. (With photo.)
</P>
<P>
   LABOR-UNION-FRAUD _ A court-appointed monitor has found
widespread financial wrongdoing in the Hotel Employees and
Restaurant Employees Union, one that has long been linked to
organized crime, attacking its former president in particular for
using union money for personal activities, like flying his wife to
Palm Springs, Calif. By Steven Greenhouse.

   TAXCUT-SHOWDOWN (Washington) _ Brushing aside a veto threat from
President Clinton, the House passed an $80 billion Republican tax
cut Saturday that would be paid for by projected federal budget
surpluses. The vote put Republicans a step closer to a politically
charged election-year showdown with the White House and
congressional Democrats over an issue that both sides believe will
play to their advantage. By Richard W. Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   MEDICARE (Washington) _ Just three months before a new era in
the history of Medicare is to begin, members of Congress and health
policy experts are expressing alarm that the federal Medicare
agency cannot make many of the changes scheduled to take effect
over the next two years. By Robert Pear.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-RELATIONSHIPS (Washington) _ To meet Bill Clinton is to
like him, even his enemies agree. But to know him is not
necessarily to love him, even his friends acknowledge. By Todd S.
Purdum.

   CLINTON-REPUBS (Washington) _ Republicans in Congress insist

   INTERNET-REGULATE-REVIEW is now INTERNET-TAXES-REVIEW.
SEX-DEFINE-REVIEW is now BIBLE-ADULTERY-REVIEW.
</P>
<P>
   MORAL-REVIEW _ President Clinton's admitted immoral behavior has
thrust to the forefront a fundamental question about the meaning of
the American presidency: Should the president be a moral leader?
And if so, what is a moral leader? Contrasting themselves with
Clinton, candidates around the country are declaring that they are
virtue personified. They are emphasizing their families and the
values by which they live. They are making the point, in essence,
that moral leaders are role models. By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-TAXES-REVIEW _ Only recently have policy-makers in
Washington, in state capitals and around the world begun to
confront the economic implications of a new retail marketplace that
recognizes no political or geographical boundaries. The issues are
sweeping. Where does a transaction take place when buyer and seller
can be defined to be in multiple locations? Will the borderless
nature of the Internet force governments further down a road that
has already led them to drop trade barriers, harmonize tax policies
and form currency unions? By Richard W. Stevenson. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BIBLE-ADULTERY-REVIEW _ President Clinton has tried to
distinguish between ``sexual relations'' and oral sex. That isn't a
distinction most Americans might make, and it certainly isn't one
the Bible focuses on in defining sexual sin. The Bible does single
out adultery for special attention in the 10 Commandments _ but
defines it in a way that might surprise many people. By Gustav
Niebuhr. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-ENABLERS-REVIEW _ A nation of Clinton Enablers?'' a
headline in The New York Post queried. ``We have all been enablers
for Bill Clinton,'' declared Time magazine. Last week, an editorial
in this newspaper spoke of Clinton's ``documentably dysfunctional
personality'' and warned that ``we must not become a nation of
enablers.'' In a recent speech, the television evangelist (and
sometime Clinton counselor) Robert Schuller asserted that ``we all
share part of the shame'' for stubbornly high public approval
ratings that have enabled Clinton so far to avoid confronting the
problem of his sexual behavior. By Joe Sharkey. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-PUNISH-REVIEW _ By now, virtually no one in the capital
contends that President Clinton shouldn't be punished for his
deceptions in the Lewinsky affair. But what to call the punishment?
By Todd S. Purdum. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SCHOOL-SAFETY-REVIEW _ The American classroom today echoes with
dire warnings about dangers and evils that seemingly lurk
everywhere, from marijuana peddlers to child molesters. The old
notion of sticking to basic education, in the view of some safety
advocates, belongs in a dreamily outdated age of innocent, white
picket-fence childhoods. What good are the three Rs, after all, to
a child trapped in the trunk of an abductor's car, a scenario
actually discussed in some child safety programs around the nation.
By Dirk Johnson. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KURDS-REVIEW _ The Kurdistan Workers' Party, which is fighting
to create a Kurdish homeland in southeastern Turkey, has offered a
cease-fire. The party leader, Abdullah Ocalan, said his forces
would not attack Turkish troops as long as troops did not attack
them. Ocalan's offer, like at least three others he has made in
recent years, fell on deaf ears. The Turkish military, which does
not take orders from civilians, refused to budge from its long-held
view that negotiating with ``separatist terrorists'' is
unthinkable. By Stephen Kinzer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EXERCISE-REVIEW _ Exercise requires metabolism, and metabolism
generates free radicals, those harmful reactive chemicals that
vitamin pills and other supplements are said to combat. The notion
that vigorous sports may actually be bad for you is hardly new or
illogical. Every tale of a former football player with brain damage
or bad knees can reinforce a popular notion that a life committed
to strenuous athletics carries bodily stress to unhealthy levels.
But there is no evidence that exercise in itself reduces life span.
By Nicholas Wade. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FUND-BAILOUT-REVIEW _ Since when does the Federal Reserve Bank
broker a bailout of an investment firm that was a victim of nothing
more than its own bad judgment? An excellent question and one that
policy-makers in troubled nations around the world may well be
scratching their heads over for some time. By Gretchen Morgenson.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-STARR-REVIEW _ The banality of legal: boring in on a
scandal. Excerpts from raw documentary evidence submitted by Ken
Starr.
</P>

   WASHINGTON _ Just three months before a new era in the history
of Medicare is to begin, members of Congress and health-policy
experts are expressing alarm that the federal Medicare agency
cannot make many of the changes scheduled to take effect over the
next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Overwhelmed with new responsibilities, federal health officials
say they will miss statutory deadlines for some of the changes,
required by the 1997 budget law, which was adopted with bipartisan
support. The changes are intended to save money and to modernize
Medicare by opening the government program to a wider range of
private health plans.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, members of a federal advisory commission studying how
to preserve Medicare for the baby boom generation say they worry
that some of the more attractive policy options under consideration
may prove unworkable for a similar reason: They cannot be carried
out in a timely way.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans complain that Medicare officials have been dragging
their feet, even though President Clinton himself proposed many of
the changes enacted. Administration officials say they have made
great efforts to carry out the law and have met most deadlines, but
now have more urgent tasks: fixing computers to cope with the year
2000. In computers that use two digits to indicate the year, 2000
is often indistinguishable from 1900.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, it is clear that Congress overestimated the
agency's ability to make hundreds of complex changes in a health
insurance program created 33 years ago on the model of Blue Cross
and Blue Shield plans.
</P>
<P>
   William Scanlon, director of health care studies at the General
Accounting Office, a nonpartisan investigative arm of Congress,
said the Medicare agency's new duties ``appear to be outstripping
its capacity to manage its existing workload.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency in question, the Health Care Financing
Administration, is swamped with work.
</P>
<P>
   In a report to be issued next month, the GAO says that Medicare
officials are ``severely behind schedule'' in fixing and testing
their computer systems. The draft report, requested by the Senate
Special Committee on Aging, says, ``It is highly unlikely that all
of the Medicare systems will be compliant in time to insure the
delivery of uninterrupted benefits and services into the year
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   In a written response to the auditors, HCFA Administrator
Nancy-Ann Min DeParle said her agency ``got a late start'' on
renovating computers, but was making ``credible progress.''
Moreover, she said, the agency has ``postponed important projects,
including activities required by the Balanced Budget Act'' of 1997,
to avoid diverting resources from its year 2000 work.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare and Medicaid benefit payments have increased 44 percent
in the last five years, to $315 billion in 1998. But the agency's
budget for people and equipment to operate these programs has been
relatively flat, around $2.2 billion a year, and the number of
employees has actually declined, to 3,942 from 4,272. Medicare
officials say they can do more with less because the agency is more
productive.
</P>
<P>
   But the delays in carrying out the 1997 law will affect Medicare
beneficiaries. One of the provisions being delayed would reduce the
amounts, known as co-insurance, that elderly people pay for
hospital outpatient services like diagnostic tests, cataract
surgery and hernia operations. Other delays will prolong the use of
an interim payment system for home health care, which is prompting
many home health agencies to cut back services to the elderly.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A new Medicare benefit for people with diabetes has been partly
carried out; patients can get coverage for blood-testing supplies
and equipment and monitors, but expanded coverage for the education
and training of people with diabetes has been delayed.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., chairman of the Health Subcommittee
of the House Ways and Means Committee, expressed the frustration of
many lawmakers when he told a Medicare official at a public hearing
the other day: ``You have added a new parameter. We come up with
what we believe is a proper policy, often based on your
recommendations. Then after it's enacted into law, you tell us you
can't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. William Roth, R-Del., chairman of the Finance Committee,
said he was ``very, very disappointed'' by the delays.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare officials have never had so many changes to make at
once. The 1997 budget law created a half-dozen new health insurance
options for the elderly, under an initiative known as
Medicare(plus)Choice, which is supposed to begin Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   But the program is off to a slow start, with just a few private
health plans submitting applications to sell new products.
</P>
<P>
   The same law radically changed the formulas used to pay home
health care agencies, hospital outpatient departments, ambulance
companies, physical therapists, nursing homes, health maintenance
organizations and other health care providers under Medicare. Under
the law, these changes are supposed to take effect in the next two
years.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Congress created a major new health insurance
program for children, supervised by the HCFA. And the agency is
struggling to enforce a 1996 law, the Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act, which guaranteed coverage for millions of
Americans who lose or change their jobs. Under this law, the agency
has unexpectedly found itself with a new role: directly regulating
private health insurance in California and four other states that
have yet to adopt the federal standards.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., a co-author of the 1996 law,
said the agency ``lacks the institutional expertise to deal with
private insurance issues'' and needed more employees to combat
``price gouging'' by insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Epstein, co-founder of a law firm that specializes in
health care issues, said, ``The people at the Health Care Financing
Administration are dedicated, hard-working people, but they have
been overwhelmed with the tasks that have been given to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Another health care lawyer, Joel Hamme, said, ``It was naive for
Congress to think that it could load a huge number of tasks on this
agency and expect the work to be completed in a timely way.''
</P>
<P>
   Medicare handles 900 million claims a year, double the number a
decade ago. Changes in payment policy all require changes in
computer systems because most claims are paid by computer. Medicare
officials must worry not only about their own computers, but also
about those run by its contractors _ more than 60 insurance
companies that pay claims for the government _ and by tens of
thousands of hospitals, doctors and other health care providers.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif., said: ``It is incomprehensible to me
how this year 2000 problem has gotten so far out of hand. The
Health Care Financing Administration is in danger of missing
numerous statutory deadlines for modernizing Medicare because the
program's contractors have failed to aggressively prepare for the
year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., said that other agencies like the
Social Security Administration had done a much better job of
preparing their computers.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare officials have said they might delay even routine
increases in payments to doctors and hospitals in 2000, because
they do not want to interfere with testing of their computers in
the final months of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Employees of the HCFA and those who deal with the agency listed
several reasons for its current difficulties:
</P>
<P>
   _ The agency recently completed a major reorganization, which
disrupted the work of many offices. Many senior and mid-level
managers and experienced technical employees have retired in the
last few years, causing a loss of institutional knowledge through
attrition.
</P>
<P>
   _ Medicare officials canceled a huge computer project, the
Medicare transaction system, which had been promoted as a way to
speed payment of claims, improve customer service, combat fraud and
prepare for the year 2000. Investigators said the project was
poorly designed, behind schedule, over budget and plagued with
problems.
</P>
<P>
   _ The agency has been slow to make the transition from simply
paying bills to promoting and managing a competitive market in
health care for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the transition, Bruce Fried, a lawyer who worked
on Clinton's 1992 campaign and then worked at the HCFA from 1994 to
1997, said: ``The agency has a tendency to be mistrustful of health
care providers, especially investor-owned organizations. Few people
at the agency have had experience in the private sector. Officials
do not fully appreciate the power of the market, and the innovation
that takes place in a market-driven economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Information about the delays has been disclosed piecemeal over
the last few months. Medicare officials said in June that they
would develop legislative proposals to change the deadlines in the
Balanced Budget Act, but so far they have not submitted such
proposals to Congress. The legal authority for the delays is thus
uncertain. Lawmakers, doctors, health care executives and advocates
for the elderly say they are confused.
</P>
<P>
   The government is ``an unpredictable and uncertain partner,''
said Thomas Miller, chief executive of the Lutheran Hospital of
Indiana, in Fort Wayne.

FOR GERMAN CHANCELLOR KOHL: A NEW CHAPTER, OR HISTORY?

<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN, Germany _ Change is not lightly accepted in a country
where stability is paramount, and as Germany prepares to vote
Sunday in national elections it appears gripped by last-minute
doubts over whether the time has come to end the era of Chancellor
Helmut Kohl.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Kohl has trailed his Social Democratic challenger,
Gerhard Schroeder, and it long seemed that the burden of 16 years
in office was too much for even the chancellor who presided over
Germany's unification to overcome. But with a relentless
conviction, Kohl has closed the gap to the point where poll takers
say any outcome is possible.
</P>
<P>
   This in itself is extraordinary. A whole generation of young
Germans has never known anything but Kohl's leadership, and
Schroeder's slick campaign, bent above all on avoiding mistakes and
conveying an image of modernity, has struck a chord with the many
who yearn for a more self-confident Germany less burdened by its
past.
</P>
<P>
   The thirst for a new face, one unmarked by the experience of
World War II, which indelibly fashioned Kohl's outlook, may still
carry Schroeder, 54, to victory. He remains the favorite, with a
lead most opinion polls put at about 2 percent. But Europe's most
powerful nation appears agonizingly torn between an awareness that
new blood may be needed and a visceral distaste for risk.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl's achievement has done much to diminish that risk. The
place of a unified Germany in NATO and at the heart of a European
Union that has adopted a single currency, the euro, is now
questioned only by small fringes of the left and neo-Nazi right.
Whatever the result, America's critical alliance with Germany will
not be rocked.
</P>
<P>
   But with a new century beckoning, a new global economy posing
challenges to Germany's long-cohesive social model and the return
to the new capital in Berlin about to be completed, Germans sense
that their vote is of decisive importance. What they see less
clearly is who should oversee the symbol-laden return to the
Reichstag in 1999, 44 years after the defeat of the Nazi regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't look at the face of Kohl any more,'' said Joachim
Jens Hesse, a political scientist. ``It's a physical thing, a
psychological thing, just as the British tired of Mrs. Thatcher.
But at the same time, this is such an awkward choice. I do not know
if I can trust the Social Democrats, especially in coalition with
the Greens.''
</P>
<P>
   Coalitions have always governed under Germany's parliamentary
system, but a ``Red-Green'' alliance is as yet untried. The idea
alarms some of the centrist voters to whom Schroeder has been
trying to appeal because the Greens have in the past called for
sharp increases in gasoline taxes and a review of Germany's NATO
membership.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative for Schroeder, if his Social Democratic Party
emerges victorious but does not have enough votes to govern with
the Greens, would be a so-called Grand Coalition with Kohl's
Christian Democrats _ a broad formula not tried for three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Unwieldy, almost certainly condemned to be short-lived, such a
coalition might at least provide the heft to push through the
difficult reform of a welfare system that Germany is hard-pressed
to afford. As in much of the rest of Europe, an aging population
and high unemployment have strained public pension and social
security payments.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Democrats have not closed the door to a Grand
Coalition, but Kohl has said categorically that he would refuse to
lead it. So, if the Christian Democrats emerge with more votes than
the Social Democrats, but not enough to renew their current
center-right coalition, the possibility exists that Kohl's acerbic
deputy, Wolfgang Schauble, could emerge as the next chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   This outcome is not likely. But Schauble, 56, who has used a
wheelchair since he was shot by a deranged man while campaigning
eight years ago, has emerged in recent opinion polls as by far the
most popular politician in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   His suggestion that ``16 weeks of Mr. Schroeder will seem longer
than 16 years of Mr. Kohl'' has proved to be one of the more
memorable phrases of a campaign in which oratory has scarcely
soared. Schauble's popularity has in turn raised doubts about the
wisdom of Kohl in insisting on seeking an unprecedented fifth term.
</P>
<P>
   It is on Kohl's protracted rule that Schroeder, the premier of
the state of Lower Saxony, has hammered, insisting in every speech
that ``Germany cannot afford four more years of Kohl.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the rest _ Germany's 4.1 million unemployed, the
country's role in Europe, the current world financial crisis, the
replacement of Germany's beloved mark by the euro in 2002 _
Schroeder has been much more vague, or simply silent, relying on
images (like a meeting with Microsoft's Bill Gates), broad promises
and rugged good looks to carry the day.
</P>
<P>
   Four previous Social Democratic candidates have tried to take on
Kohl by more confrontational means: Hans-Jochen Vogel in 1983,
Johannes Rau in 1987, Oskar Lafontaine in 1990 and Rudolf Scharping
in 1994. They all looked good for a while; they all failed. Not for
nothing do Social Democratic posters insist, and insist again, that
``Wir Sind Bereit'' _ ``We are ready''.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they are. In the end, it may be the unification of
Germany, Kohl's crowning achievement, that proves his undoing.
</P>
<P>
   Unification has proved extraordinarily costly. Germany has been
transferring the equivalent of about 4.3 percent of its gross
national product, or total output, to the east since 1990,
straining public finances, transforming the area with new
enterprises and urban projects, but failing to resolve the problems
of the 16 million citizens of the former Communist state.
</P>
<P>
   About one in five people of working age in the east is
unemployed. The anger of these people, who once hailed Kohl for
unifying the country, has been directed at the Christian Democratic
Party, whose support in the area has plunged from close to 40
percent to under 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   These votes will not all go to the Social Democrats _ the Party
of Democratic Socialism (former Communists) and various neo-Nazi
groupings have both benefited _ but the damage to Kohl may prove
insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a free fall in Christian Democrat support in
the east,'' said Lutz Erbring, a political analyst. ``And I suspect
it is in the east that the outcome of this election will be
decided.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The other factor propelling Schroeder is a vaguer but equally
potent one. Germany has been in an assertive mood of late _ its big
corporations have been buying up the likes of Random House,
Chrysler and Rolls-Royce _ and the Social Democratic challenger has
contrived to symbolize this less cautious, less fettered spirit of
a nation that feels it has labored under the weight of its past for
long enough.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder's call to rethink a planned Holocaust memorial in
Berlin _ a monument strongly supported by Kohl _ has provided one
of the few, clear policy conflicts between the two candidates and
captured their differing priorities and preoccupations.
</P>
<P>
   While Kohl dwells on the wounds of war, the glories of Germany's
reconstruction, the building of a united Europe and the precious
prize of peace, Schroeder wants to shift the focus unflinchingly to
the future.
</P>
<P>
   He has by no means convinced everyone. The large number of
undecided voters _ more than 20 percent, according to several polls
_ appears to reflect in part the hesitations of many Germans in
trusting a candidate who has shunned direct, declarative sentences
throughout the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that many of the so-called undecided are in fact
people who will end up not voting, so their importance may be
exaggerated. But if the hesitant opt in the end for Kohl's camp _
the reservoir of potential Christian Democratic voters is believed
to be larger than that of the Social Democrats _ they could still
swing the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am afraid that Kohl will still win it,'' said Andrea Zeller,
a 25-year-old student, as she watched the chancellor at a rally in
Munich this week. ``It's time for a change, but he always catches
up.'' She added that she would vote for the Greens, but without the
conviction that a ``Red-Green'' coalition could win.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week of campaigning, Kohl has been playing on the
fears of a conservative people, trying to portray Schroeder as the
gateway to a Communist presence in government. He has attacked
Schroeder's proposal to grant citizenship to some of Germany's 7
million foreign residents, and warned of instability.
</P>
<P>
   With unemployment falling _ it is expected to drop below 4
million this month after going as high as 4.8 million earlier this
year _ and the German economy enjoying a recovery, Kohl's
statements appear to have had an impact. His appearance as a rock
of stability at a moment of world uncertainty, when the U.S.
president, Bill Clinton, is clearly distracted, has also helped his
cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``A company that is doing well does not change its chief
executive just because he has been there for 15 to 20 years,'' said
Christoph Ahlhaus, 29, a banker. ``Why should we?''
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that Germany has enough problems, and Kohl
enough years in power, for Schroeder to have a strong chance.
Another truth is that, whoever wins, Germany is likely to flex its
muscle more in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not want a European superstate,'' Kohl declared in
Munich. ``We want a strong Germany in Europe.'' That statement
amounted to a shift: Germany long talked approvingly of a United
States of Europe, with a truly federal system.
</P>
<P>
   But the painful abandonment of the mark for the euro was
Germany's pledge of good faith to the European idea. Now, whether
under Schroeder or under Kohl once again, or under some other
chancellor, the country clearly feels it has the right and the
might to make its voice heard, and to do so without any complexes.

<P>
   The raw evidence made public last week in the presidential sex
scandal was a turnoff to many people in more ways than one: Not
only was it wince-inducing, thanks to its subject matter, but it
was also yawn-inducing, thanks to its sheer length and volume. This
curious fact undoubtedly occurred to those who fidgeted through all
four-plus hours of deposition verite starring Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But the videotape wasn't the half of it. The accompanying,
3,100-page document-drop by the House Judiciary Committee (to be
followed by a far bigger one this week) included numerous
excursions into the tedious, the mundane and the irrelevant. Yep, a
lot of this is real forehead-bouncing-on-the-table material, folks,
and some of it is unintentionally funny.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing this out is not to judge whether the evidence, over
all, is compelling or not. Rather, the tedium is a reflection of
the legal and procedural rigamarole that is so much a feature of
modern American life.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's on display for all to behold, and writ large, in the
struggle between Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and the White
House. Evidence follows.
</P>
<P>
   _ By TOM KUNTZ &QR;
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Exhibit A: Profiles in penmanship. On May
28, Monica Lewinsky, her lawyer William Ginsburg and her father,
Dr. Bernard Lewinsky, were escorted by government agents up to the
17th floor of FBI headquarters in Los Angeles so she could give
handwriting samples to investigators. As noted in a memo from
Starr's office, it was a complex process. And it didn't go
smoothly: (END ITALICS HERE)  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The pens used for this examination were as follows: one Bic,
round stic, medium, black ink pen; one Paper Mate pen with black
ink; and one Paper Mate gel writer, with black ink. At various
times during the examination, LEWINSKY was asked to use one of the
three different pens. LEWINSKY's attorneys interrupted the
examination on numerous occasions so LEWINSKY could consult
privately with her attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   MONICA LEWINSKY was first asked to write the alphabet in its
entirety, with three different pens, on an 8{'' x 11'' sheet of
paper (unless specified otherwise, each sheet of paper used was
8{'' x 11'') attached to a pad. On the same sheet of paper,
LEWINSKY was asked to write the number 1 thru 10, three times,
using a different pen each time.
</P>
<P>
   LEWINSKY was then asked to perform the same task, this time
using a sheet of paper resting only on the desk where she was
sitting.
</P>
<P>
   LEWINSKY was then asked to print her name three times on a sheet
of paper attached to a pad, each time using a different pen.
LEWINSKY was then asked to sign her name on a sheet of paper
attached to a pad, each time using a different pen. LEWINSKY was
then asked to perform the same task, with the sheet of paper used
resting directly on the desk.
</P>
<P>
   LEWINSKY was then asked to sign her name to a photocopy of a
blank check. At that time, GINSBURG objected and advised his client
not to sign the form. GINSBURG advised that the OIC (Office of the
Independent Counsel) would need to get a court order before his
client would sign anything that resembled a check. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The handwriting examination continued until approximately 10:06
a.m., when LEWINSKY took a break to visit the restroom. . . .
</P>
<P>
   At approximately 11:00 a.m., the examination ended, at which
time GINSBURG was served grand jury subpoena number D-1319 for
LEWINSKY's appearance on June 4, 1998, in Washington D.C., to
provide handwriting exemplars. GINSBURG advised (that) he thought a
handwriting examination was just completed. GINSBURG was advised
that all requested exemplars were not provided; therefore, LEWINSKY
would have to come to Washington D.C., to do so.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Exhibit B: The ``dribble glass.'' In her
grand jury testimony on Aug. 20, Ms. Lewinsky was about to vent her
anger at President Clinton for giving away one of her gift ties to
his steward, Bayani Nelvis. But then her drinking cup started
leaking, eliciting this exchange involving Michael Emmick, an
associate independent counsel, and an unidentified grand juror:(END
ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   JUROR: Can you tell me what your thoughts were when you saw the
pictures of Nelvis wearing the first tie that you gave the
President?
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Yes. Actually, you know what? I think my cup's
leaking. I'm sorry.
</P>
<P>
   JUROR: Do we have another cup up there?
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Am I allowed to know people's names in here?
</P>
<P>
   MR. EMMICK: The answer to that is no.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Oh _
</P>
<P>
   MR. EMMICK: I know it seems _
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: It's so awkward.
</P>
<P>
   MR. EMMICK: It does seem awkward, but I think it's better if _
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: OK
</P>
<P>
   MR. EMMICK: _ the record not have any identifications.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: OK
</P>
<P>
   MR. EMMICK: We didn't intentionally get you a dribble glass.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Oh, sure. At least it's water and not grape juice.
</P>
<P>
   I had two very different thoughts. My first thought was, ``You
jerk''. . . .
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Exhibit C: Answering machine blather. Many
of the phone messages left for Ms. Lewinsky at her Watergate
apartment, and transcribed by Starr's office, seem relevant to the
case. Others ramble on in pretty ordinary fashion:(END ITALICS
HERE)
</P>
<P>
   CHRIS (no last name given): Hi, Monica. It's Chris here. I guess
about 8:00 a.m. your time on Saturday morning. I was just ringing
up to say thanks so much for the brilliant Pentagon, um, sweatshirt
that I'm going to have a lot of fun wearing here in the winter
months.
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, I won't get beaten up by any, um, anti-American
leftists _ leftists, so that we'll have to wait and see. But
anyhow, it was a really nice present. Thanks so much for that.
</P>
<P>
   And um, well, I hope you can get on the e-mail soon because I
miss, uh, our little e-mail chats, not to mention the jokes. I
haven't heard a good joke, except for some John Denver jokes, in
quite some time. So, anyhow _ and Sonny Bono jokes too, which is
rather crass. I got a Sonny Bono joke next day, which is terrible.
</P>
<P>
   Anyhow, uh, I'll, um, hope to be hearing from you soon. OK
Ta-ta. Bye-bye.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Exhibit D: Name that date. Linda Tripp's
recordings of her phone conversations with Ms. Lewinsky
(transcripts are expected this week) were originally not dated. So
Starr's office had to deduce when the tapes were made, and provided
painstaking written explanations:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Conversation (NU)3:
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Oct. 4, 1997 . . .
</P>
<P>
   The conversation that immediately precedes this conversation on
the tape occurred on Friday, Oct. 3, 1997. At the end of the
previous portion, Ms. Lewinsky notes that it is 10:20, that she is
going to sleep, and she indicates that she is not working the next
day. . . . This conversation begins with Ms. Lewinsky describing
her trip to the Potomac Mills Mall for the day. . . . The placement
of the conversation on the tape and the day-long trip to the mall
are consistent with a weekend day.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Ms. Lewinsky says Betty Currie was in the office
during the morning because of the Radio Address. . . . The
President delivered a Radio Address on Saturday, Oct. 4, 1997,
10:06 a.m. Also, Betty Currie rarely works on Sunday because it is
her ``church day.'' . . . Ms. Lewinsky further says she wants to
buy the President a gift because he now had a hearing aid. . . .
The President was fitted for hearing aids on Oct. 3, 1997. See
``Age Catching Up With Clinton; He's Getting Hearing Aids,'' Sandra
Sobieraj, The Associated Press, Oct. 3, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky also says there are three months before the
beginning of the year, and she refers to sunglasses she bought the
President for his Latin America trip. . . .
</P>
<P>
   These factors are consistent with a conversation on Oct. 4,
1997.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Exhibit last: The lunch bunch. The
presidency may be at stake, but people have to eat. At Ms.
Lewinsky's Aug. 6 grand jury deposition, Deputy Independent Counsel
Solomon Wisenberg checks to see if the food has arrived:(END
ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   MR. EMMICK: I have no more questions about this date, and I look
at the time and it looks like it's 12:30.
</P>
<P>
   THE FOREPERSON (unidentified): Sol, I think, went to check on
something.
</P>
<P>
   MR. EMMICK: Oh, all right.
</P>
<P>
   THE FOREPERSON: Did you check on something for lunch?
</P>
<P>
   MR. WISENBERG: I have checked. It is here. It's been here.
</P>
<P>
   MR. EMMICK: OK All right. Well, if this would be a good time to
break for lunch _
</P>
<P>
   THE FOREPERSON: Hourlong.
</P>
<P>
   MR. EMMICK: OK
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: OK
</P>
<P>
   THE FOREPERSON: OK
</P>
<P>
   MR. EMMICK: Thank you.
</P>
<P>
   (Whereupon, at 12:34 p.m., a luncheon recess was taken.)
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)When those assembled reconvened after lunch,
Ms. Lewinsky had a suggestion:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Time for a nap? . . .
</P>
<P>
   THE FOREPERSON: . . . Monica, I'd like to remind you that you
are still under oath.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Do as I say, not as I do.
</P>
<P>
   That was the message in the extraordinary rescue last Wednesday
of a prominent but speculative investment firm called Long-Term
Capital Management. The rescuers, rallied by none other than the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York, were a consortium of Wall Street
brokerage firms and major banks.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Capital, a four-year-old firm founded by John
Meriwether, a former vice-chairman of Salomon Brothers, found
itself on the brink of bankruptcy last week after most of its
multibillion dollar bets in world stock and bond markets had gone
bad. The firm had lost more than $4 billion; the deal to save it
required a cash infusion of $3.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Since when does the Federal Reserve Bank broker a bailout of an
investment firm that was a victim of nothing more than its own bad
judgment? An excellent question and one that policy-makers in
troubled nations around the world may well be scratching their
heads over for some time.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because a Fed-sponsored bailout of a speculative investment
fund doesn't track with the medicine U.S. policy-makers have been
dispensing to financial institutions in distress around the world.
Japan, for example, whose banking system is near collapse, has been
told repeatedly that tough love is the answer to its predicament.
If a bank is insolvent, let it fail and move on. Just say no to the
Japanese convoy system, in which healthy banks prop up their
unhealthy brethren.
</P>
<P>
   The same has been said to apply to Russia, where the
International Monetary Fund's refusal to bail out the economy last
summer is another good example of the widespread belief that nobody
should be considered too big to fail.
</P>
<P>
   Come closer to home, however, and the story changes. Long-Term
Capital was a fund aimed at wealthy individuals and institutions _
minimum investment: $10 million. It had borrowed enough money from
the banks and brokerages it did business with to have a portfolio
of trades worth $120 billion on capital of roughly $4 billion: Too
big to fail.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that exactly one week prior to the near collapse of
the firm, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, the chief bank
regulator in the nation, testified to Congress that the problems in
the Asian economies were the result of laxity on the part of
lenders there. Greenspan said that banks and financial institutions
that are in trouble should be helped carefully so as not to
encourage further reckless lending. ``Any temporary financial
assistance must be carefully tailored to be conditional and not
encourage undue moral hazard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing at a high school in Washington on Friday, Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin spoke about the investment firm debacle. He
said: ``This is not a bailout; there's no public money. It was a
decision by the private sector that their economic interests lay in
these arrangements.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds rather like Japan's convoy system, no?

   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Few spectacles in recent decades have been as
breathtaking as the historic handshakes between government leaders
and chieftains of insurgent groups. From Central America to Israel
and from South Africa to Northern Ireland, these scenes, which for
years or decades were unthinkable, have shattered old assumptions
and opened up new futures for long-suffering groups of people.
</P>
<P>
   In each of these places, politicians and generals spent years
denouncing rebel leaders as terrorists and swearing never to
compromise with them. It was not easy for them to change their
minds, considering the images of bombings, murders and tearful
funerals that even now burn in their memories.
</P>
<P>
   Now two more of the world's rebel armies, watching the
breakthrough in Northern Ireland from opposite corners of the
European land mass, have called unilateral cease-fires and declared
their willingness to talk peace. But the two approaches have met
with diametrically opposed reactions, and the difference is
revealing.
</P>
<P>
   In Spain, a cease-fire announced by the Basque separatist group
ETA set off a political earthquake. Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar
cut short a tour of South America to rush home. Interior Minister
Jaime Mayor Oreja appeared live on national television to say that
while he was uncertain of the ETA's sincerity, he welcomed the
cease-fire with ``happiness and relief.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Time will be the judge of the sincerity, authenticity and
depth of this decision,'' Mayor Oreja said. But he added, ``While
there is a truce, there will be no tragedy, no deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   At almost the same time, the Kurdistan Workers' Party, which is
fighting to create a Kurdish homeland in southeastern Turkey, also
offered a cease-fire. The party leader, Abdullah Ocalan, said his
forces would not attack Turkish troops as long as troops did not
attack them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been fighting for years, and now we have chosen
peace,'' Ocalan told journalists by telephone from an undisclosed
location. ``We should be given a fair chance in politics. If we are
given this chance in a democratic way, we will give up our arms. We
are ready for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan's offer, like at least three others he has made in recent
years, fell on deaf ears. The Turkish military, which does not take
orders from civilians, refused to budge from its long-held view
that negotiating with ``separatist terrorists'' is unthinkable. A
government spokesman said the cease-fire offer was ``not to be
taken seriously.'' Soon afterward the army launched a major
offensive in which it said 53 insurgents died.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did not abide by the truce we declared,'' Ocalan said as
he announced a resumption of his violent campaign. ``We will
intensify our attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   The ETA campaign in Spain has cost nearly 800 lives over 30
years. Savage as it has been, it is dwarfed in scope by the Kurdish
war, which has taken more than 28,000 lives in 14 years. Some might
imagine that the toll Turkey has paid would make its people
war-weary, but in some quarters it has had the opposite effect.
Nationalist groups are powerful here, and they would explode in
anger at any hint of a negotiated settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish generals believe that negotiating would be a form of
surrender, and would constitute intolerable disrespect to soldiers
who have been killed over the years. They also fear that since
Kurdish rebels are supported by Syria, one of Turkey's principal
enemies, any concession to them would be seen as a sign that Turkey
is vulnerable to pressure from hostile powers.
</P>
<P>
   The Kurdish conflict has hurt Turkey economically, because it
costs the army an estimated $8 billion each year and thus feeds one
of the world's highest inflation rates; socially, because it has
sent hundreds of thousands of refugees streaming from the war zone
into big cities that are ill-prepared to receive them; politically,
because it forces the government to restrict democracy by banning
parties that advocate Kurdish nationalism; internationally, because
it gives Turkey the image of a warlike nation unwilling to follow
the path of reconciliation. And all the while, it hardens hearts on
both sides and leads people to accept bloodshed and terror as
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most important reason Spain and Turkey responded so
differently to cease-fire calls is the difference in their form of
government. Spain is a full democracy in which voters can choose
any party and political platform. Turkey is a semi-democracy in
which the military makes final decisions on key questions of
national security.
</P>
<P>
   Although a new group of commanders took over control of the
Turkish military last month, there is no hint that their resolve to
carry on the Kurdish war is weakening. Even urging them to change
their minds is considered close to treason. Politicians or
journalists who describe the insurgents as authentic
representatives of the Kurdish people, or who call for a negotiated
end to the conflict, risk prosecution and imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, one Turkish politician who is a pillar of the
establishment, Husamettin Cindoruk, broke ranks and urged the
military to consider a solution along the lines of Northern
Ireland's. Skeptics suggested that Cindoruk, a conservative who
heads one of the three parties in the coalition government, was
just trawling for Kurdish votes. Still, his words amazed many
Turks.
</P>
<P>
   If other mainstream political leaders begin speaking like him,
pressure may build on the military to re-examine its approach to
the conflict. So far, however, that seems inconceivable. For the
moment, the only hope for peace talks here comes from the example
of other countries. After all, it was for years inconceivable that
Irish nationalists would join their longtime enemies in a new
assembly, or that Yasser Arafat would shake hands with an Israeli
prime minister, or that the leader of South Africa's apartheid
regime would embrace Nelson Mandela as a partner.
</P>
<P>
   There is, too, the example of Nicaragua, where, in the
mid-1980s, the Sandinista interior minister, Tomas Borge, vowed,
``Before we talk to the contra leaders, rivers will flow uphill
from the seashore to the mountains, and the sun will rise in the
west and set in the east.'' Two years later, Contra and Sandinista
leaders stood together on a makeshift stage, joined in singing
their national anthem, and signed a treaty ending their war.

Kurdish rebels are supported by Syria, one of Turkey's principal
enemies, any concession to them would be seen as a sign that Turkey
is vulnerable to pressure from hostile powers.
</P>
<P>
   The Kurdish conflict has hurt Turkey economically, because it
costs the army an estimated $8 billion each year and thus feeds one
of the world's highest inflation rates; socially, because it has
sent hundreds of thousands of refugees streaming from the war zone
into big cities that are ill-prepared to receive them; politically,
because it forces the government to restrict democracy by banning
parties that advocate Kurdish nationalism; internationally, because
it gives Turkey the image of a warlike nation unwilling to follow
the path of reconciliation. And all the while, it hardens hearts on
both sides and leads people to accept bloodshed and terror as
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most important reason Spain and Turkey responded so
differently to cease-fire calls is the difference in their form of
government. Spain is a full democracy in which voters can choose
any party and political platform. Turkey is a semi-democracy in
which the military makes final decisions on key questions of
national security.
</P>
<P>
   Although a new group of commanders took over control of the
Turkish military last month, there is no hint that their resolve to
carry on the Kurdish war is weakening. Even urging them to change
their minds is considered close to treason. Politicians or
journalists who describe the insurgents as authentic
representatives of the Kurdish people, or who call for a negotiated
end to the conflict, risk prosecution and imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, one Turkish politician who is a pillar of the
establishment, Husamettin Cindoruk, broke ranks and urged the
military to consider a solution along the lines of Northern
Ireland's. Skeptics suggested that Cindoruk, a conservative who
heads one of the three parties in the coalition government, was
just trawling for Kurdish votes. Still, his words amazed many
Turks.
</P>
<P>
   If other mainstream political leaders begin speaking like him,
pressure may build on the military to re-examine its approach to
the conflict. So far, however, that seems inconceivable. For the
moment, the only hope for peace talks here comes from the example
of other countries. After all, it was for years inconceivable that
Irish nationalists would join their longtime enemies in a new
assembly, or that Yasser Arafat would shake hands with an Israeli
prime minister, or that the leader of South Africa's apartheid
regime would embrace Nelson Mandela as a partner.
</P>
<P>
   There is, too, the example of Nicaragua, where, in the
mid-1980s, the Sandinista interior minister, Tomas Borge, vowed,
``Before we talk to the contra leaders, rivers will flow uphill
from the seashore to the mountains, and the sun will rise in the
west and set in the east.'' Two years later, Contra and Sandinista
leaders stood together on a makeshift stage, joined in singing
their national anthem, and signed a treaty ending their war.

<P>
   Welcome back to school, children. Lesson No. 1: The world is a
dangerous place, filled with creeps, poisons and predators. Beware!
</P>
<P>
   The American classroom today echoes with dire warnings about
dangers and evils that seemingly lurk everywhere, from marijuana
peddlers to child molesters.
</P>
<P>
   The old notion of sticking to basic education, in the view of
some safety advocates, belongs in a dreamily outdated age of
innocent, white picket-fence childhoods. What good are the three
R's, after all, to a child trapped in the trunk of an abductor's
car, a scenario actually discussed in some child safety programs
around the nation. (The recommended response: Unhook the taillight
wires to alert the police.)
</P>
<P>
   Among the many worries of parents, illegal drugs rank near the
top. In declaring a virtual war on drug abuse, Americans have
responded for more than a decade with drug-education programs that
cost hundreds of millions of dollars and consume precious classroom
time.
</P>
<P>
   By far the biggest of these efforts, Drug Abuse Resistance
Education, or DARE, is used in about 70 percent of the nation's
public schools and has generally won overwhelming approval from
students, parents, teachers and the police officers who conduct the
classes. DARE, which relies on workbook teaching and promotes
kinship with the police, is one of about 50 antidrug and safety
campaigns in schools.
</P>
<P>
   There's just one problem: these programs generally don't work.
</P>
<P>
   Several studies have found that children who attend
drug-education classes are just as likely to use illegal drugs as
students who do not participate.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, officials of nonprofit drug prevention programs have
dismissed the studies with claims that the findings were colored by
the political agendas of academics and researchers. But the latest
study, released early this year, was conducted by Dennis Rosenbaum,
a professor who had been a DARE supporter, and was financed by the
Illinois State Police, a champion of the program.
</P>
<P>
   Among other discouraging findings, this study found that DARE
has even unwittingly encouraged some young people to try drugs,
especially students in the suburbs, according to Rosenbaum, a
criminal justice professor at the University of Illinois in
Chicago. DARE has defended its results and points to endorsements
from many school districts.
</P>
<P>
   School-based anti-drug programs remain popular despite such
findings, though an increasing number of skeptical voices have been
raised. A number of cities have even quit DARE, including Oakland,
Omaha, Spokane, Wash., and Fayetteville, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Wysong, an Indiana University professor at the Kokomo
campus, whose research has found DARE programs to be ineffective in
curbing drug use, said people were starting to become ``a little
less enthusiastic'' about the program.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics of drug-education efforts say students learn
quickly that they are being given a message _ and that a message is
different from education. Moreover, if students come to see any
part of an anti-drug campaign as propaganda, they tend to distrust
the entire message.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these concerns, Wysong said, critics find it difficult
to speak out. ``You leave yourself open to charges that you're not
on the team in fighting this plague,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-drug programs often go far beyond warnings about illegal
drugs, alcohol and cigarettes, teaching children to be wary of
unfamiliar adults and giving them specific game plans for escape.
</P>
<P>
   During the weeks before Halloween, for example, many parents
will be warned about the risks of trick-or-treating, and virtually
all of them will be told not to let their children eat anything
that isn't factory-wrapped. For many parents, giving a shiny red
apple to a child on Halloween nowadays is about as thoughtless as
offering a cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents and child psychologists have raised concerns that
children are being scared needlessly, noting that kidnappers hiding
in the bushes are actually exceedingly rare. But such cases are the
stuff of made-for-television movies and lurid accounts on local
newscasts. The fact is that children are far more likely to be
abused by a family member.
</P>
<P>
   Drug-education programs have also raised some concerns among
civil libertarians, who feel uneasy about classrooms being turned
over to uniformed police officers. In the case of DARE, a question
box sits in the classroom during the program, so children can talk
anonymously about anything _ including the drug-taking habits of
friends or family members.
</P>
<P>
   The DARE officer will not listen to specific allegations, but
instead encourages the children to report such activity to a school
official. And when a child goes to a teacher or counselor with
knowledge of such drug-taking _ for example, a parent who smokes
marijuana _ the school is bound to go to the legal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Loren Siegel, director of public education for the American
Civil Liberties Union, said the organization had no official
position on programs like DARE.
</P>
<P>
   But, she added, ``Anything that encourages surveillance _
reporting on your family members or friends _ cannot be good for a
democracy.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By now, virtually no one in the capital contends
that President Clinton shouldn't be punished for his deceptions in
the Lewinsky affair. But what to call the punishment?
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment is the constitutional process of review by the House
of Representatives and trial by the Senate, and Congressional
Republicans have made it clear they intend to forge ahead, though
David Letterman cracked that the president wonders whether he could
just maybe be ``peached.'' There is also censure, a ritual shaming
not specified in the Constitution, but applied to President Andrew
Jackson and later revoked.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is ``censure-plus,'' an invention first floated by
the former Clinton aide George Stephanopoulos and others, in which
the president would pay some financial penalty as well. But
Washington Post columnist E.J. Dionne complained that censure-plus
sounds like a detergent _ and constitutional scholars say it may
not be legal in any case.
</P>
<P>
   There is sanction, which is also financially punitive, but
sounds like an economic embargo on a rogue state, and besides,
Clinton has already run up some $6 million in legal bills.
</P>
<P>
   There is resignation, but that is what Republicans feel about
Clinton's determination never to leave office voluntarily, not the
president's own plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if you call it `Impeachment with Oak Leaf
cluster,' or `Son of Censure' it won't make a whit of difference,''
said former Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., who now heads the Institute
of Politics at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard.
``We're right back to the same four things, and those are called
pride, honesty, truth and respect, and the stain is not on the
dress but on our national fabric.''

   UROSEVAC, Yugoslavia _ The last time Hava Bislimi saw her eldest
son, Rexhap, his face was battered with bruises. He was being
pushed by security police officers into the family's front garden,
where he was handed a shovel and ordered to dig for weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Reeling from beatings at the police station, Bislimi, a
33-year-old accountant, was too weak to follow the orders. So
neighbors were called in to help. After they failed to find the
alleged cache, Bislimi was told to look at the house where he had
been born, a sprawling structure with an ancient apple tree in the
courtyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the last time you will see it,'' Serbian officers were
overheard saying as they marched him out of the gate.
</P>
<P>
   They were right. The six weeks that began with Bislimi's arrest
on his way to a family gathering July 6 and ended Aug. 21 with his
reportedly brutal death in Serbian police custody have been pieced
together by his 63-year-old mother, a sister and a cousin.
</P>
<P>
   His death is one example, human rights officials say, of the
arbitrary arrests and torture that the Serbian authorities are
using to warn ethnic Albanian civilians to stop supporting a
separatist guerrilla force fighting for the independence of
Serbia's Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
   Rights experts say these extrajudicial methods used by officials
under the control of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic run
parallel to the military intimidation by special police forces and
the Yugoslav army, which continued this week to fire artillery at
villages in central Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian judicial officials have announced the start of trials
next month of 900 Albanians being held in Kosovo on charges of
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch, a New York-based group that is documenting
Bislimi's death and those of four other Albanians in police custody
in the last two months, has expressed concern about the fairness of
these trials. A senior official working with the U.N. human rights
commissioner in Geneva _ former Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Jiri
Dienstbier _ has asked Milosevic to grant the 900 amnesty as part
of a possible political settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The International Committee of the Red Cross has requested
permission to interview those being held, but its officials have
been granted access only in a very limited number of cases. Under
Serbian law, judges must grant pretrial access, but for the most
part it has been denied, said Nic Sommer, a Red Cross spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining their concern about the trials, Human Rights Watch
officials cite the case of a lawyer, Destan Rukiqi, an ethnic
Albanian who in July was tried, sent to prison and severely beaten.
</P>
<P>
   Two Rights Watch researchers now compiling data in Kosovo, Fred
Abrahams and Peter Bouckaert, said the Rukiqi case set a disturbing
precedent.
</P>
<P>
   It began while Rukiqi was reviewing the police papers of a
fellow Albanian, Cen Dugolli, who was being held in custody without
charges. An argument erupted between Rukiqi and the senior judge in
the Pristina district court, Danica Marinkovic.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Marinkovic objected to the way Rukiqi addressed her and
ordered his arrest. Rukiqi was sentenced to jail for 60 days in
Pristina, the Kosovo capital, Bouckaert said. There, he was so
severely beaten that his kidneys failed, and he almost lapsed into
a coma.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently afraid that Rukiqi, who is well known in his field,
might die in custody, the Serbian authorities transferred him to a
hospital in Belgrade, the rights researchers said. During his
treatment, his sentence was reduced by half.
</P>
<P>
   When he was released from the hospital, he learned that his
client, Dugolli, had died in police custody after severe beatings,
the researchers said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rexhap Bislimi, according to his family, was never charged. When
the police brought him home for those two hours on July 7, they
said he had hidden weapons for the guerrilla forces. Despite
repeated visits to the prison where he was being held near his
hometown, and then in Pristina, his relatives said, the family was
never allowed to see him.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Mrs. Bislimi said, she knows why. He was too badly beaten,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   When she went to the prison on the official visiting day, she
said, she was told he was being interrogated and was unavailable.
But she noticed an ambulance pull up at the prison while she was
waiting to see him. Later, a sympathetic doctor at a hospital in
Pristina got word to the family that her son was in very bad
condition.
</P>
<P>
   The family rushed to the hospital, but Mrs. Bislimi said another
friendly medic warned them that he was in such bad shape, you don't
want to look.'' But they did learn that there was a chance to save
her son's life if they got some medicine to stop internal bleeding.
So, she said, they spent 1,000 German marks on a list of drugs and
gathered blood from relatives and friends.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, when they arrived to deliver the drugs, they were
told the patient was dead, Mrs. Bislimi said. On the death
certificate, issued the following day, he was said to have died
from blows to the head and body.
</P>
<P>
   At the local jail, Mrs. Bislimi continued, the police returned
her son's belongings: a watch; his identity card in a leather
folder, its photo showing a handsome man with a shock of
light-brown hair; his wallet, with a dollar bill tucked inside.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Albanians attended his funeral. He had been an
active member of the Human Rights Council of Kosovo, founded in
1990 by ethnic Albanian leaders peacefully seeking Kosovo's
independence from Serbia. And apparently he had always been a bit
of rebel. When he was 16, he was jailed for three days, and in
1988, after joining the Yugoslav army, he served a two-year
sentence on charges of organizing against the army, Mrs. Bislimi
said.
</P>
<P>
   To console her son's eldest daughter, Ardita, 6, Mrs. Bislimi
said she had told her he had gone to Germany. But the child had
seen enough not to believe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Ardita replied, according to her grandmother. ``My
father has gone to the graveyard.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   TEWKSBURY, N.J. _ When Bill Ingraham was growing up in the late
1950s, baseball was a gang of friends playing endless pickup games
in a make-do field formed by the Passaic Avenue offramp at Route 3
in Clifton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would play all day,'' Ingraham recalled. ``I'd get 50 or 60
at-bats. Kids these days are limited to one game a week, and they
get three, maybe four at-bats. They're not going to learn the
fundamentals that way.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ingraham, 44, is a successful manufacturer of peel-and-stick
shipping labels, and success in business has allowed him to give
his 11-year-old son, Brian, the kind of playing time that a vacant
field once offered him. So in the summer of 1997, behind his
immense new house here in the heart of New Jersey horse country, in
the same town where Gov. Christie Whitman lives, Ingraham built a
full-size ball field to major-league specifications, with a
regulation clay infield _ the same three clays used at Yankee
Stadium, he says _ and a 5,000-square-foot gymnasium for batting
practice and winter basketball games.
</P>
<P>
   Brian loves the field. Brian's friends, who show up every day,
love it, too. But Ingraham's neighbors see things differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been worse than anything you can imagine,'' said
Kathleen DeSerio, a garden designer and hairdresser who has worked
for seven years to restore her 1,500-square-foot Cape Cod-style
house on the lot adjoining Ingraham's left field. ``My house is
finally to the point where it is livable, and it is really quite
beautiful, and now I have Fenway Park behind me. The only person
who hasn't shown up is Kevin Costner.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems that a three-acre ball field is not what the neighbors
moved out here to see, or hear. Last summer, pickup teams regularly
held games on the diamond on weekends. The ``tink'' of aluminum
bats on balls, the cheering from the sidelines and the traffic on
Beavers Road from parents and friends and more players have
prompted the township and several neighbors to sue for the removal
of the ball field and the gymnasium and for the return of
Ingraham's 6.4-acre property to the kind of polished naturalness
that people around here apparently favor.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DeSerio grumbled with rueful humor, ``If this was happening
in Christie's backyard I doubt very much that anything would have
gotten this far.''
</P>
<P>
   She and three neighbors _ Dr. Elliott Rosen, a retired Rutgers
University history professor, and James and Diane Kudless, the
Ingrahams' nearest neighbors _ have joined Tewksbury Township's
suit to have Ingraham's field bulldozed. It is true, as Ingraham
emphasizes, that Tewksbury _ one of the wealthiest towns in New
Jersey, with a median family of $95,000 _ has miles of horse trails
but no Little League fields, Ms. DeSerio said. But the town has
bought land for ball fields, and if Ingraham cared to, Ms. DeSerio
said, he could get involved in the effort to create those fields.
</P>
<P>
   Town officials did not respond to repeated phone messages
requesting comment, leaving the town's lawyer in this case, Joseph
Murray of Berkeley Heights, to speak for it. The township granted a
building permit for Ingraham's gymnasium, and no permit was
required for the ball field because it does not have any
structures, Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   But in its lawsuit, the town contends that using the field for
baseball games violates the ``auxiliary use'' provisions of the
town zoning laws, because baseball is played with a minimum of 18
players, plus officials and coaches. The laws' provisions, the town
contends, are intended to allow things like tennis courts, swimming
pools and horse corrals, which involve fewer people.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman, who lives on a 222-acre farm that lies partly in
Tewksbury several miles from the Ingrahams' field, has been in
Mexico recently and has not commented on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Ingraham admits that he made mistakes when he and his family
moved to Tewksbury three years ago. He had hoped to create a
baseball camp for grown-ups and children, but has given up on that
idea because of opposition in this town of about 5,200 people.
Since the neighbors first complained about the ball field _ not to
him, he maintains, only to town officials and to lawyers _ he has
agreed, in court, to some restrictions, pending the outcome of the
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   For now, no ball games are played on the diamond, which is used
only for batting and fielding practice. He has accepted a limit of
four children under the age of 13 on the field at a time, the use
of wood bats only _ the sound of baseballs striking aluminum
bothered Rosen, his lawyer said _ no cheerleaders, no Sunday play
and no more than two adults, in addition to Ingraham, on the field.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the restrictions, Ingraham thinks he has the lore and
logic of baseball on his side.
</P>
<P>
   He stood in the slanting autumn sunlight the other day and
watched his son's private coach, a Boston Red Sox minor leaguer
named Bob Slomski, put Brian and several other boys through batting
practice. ``I made mistakes,'' Ingraham said, ``but I never told
them I was going to stop playing baseball, because that's my thing.
Their thing is tennis, my thing is baseball.'' He said that
baseball is part of every boy's childhood and should not be
interfered with.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Matters of style obviously count around here. In an atmosphere
of restrained good taste, Ingraham has the manner of a man who
would not be above kicking a little dirt on the shoes of any umpire
who didn't like his style. In a town that reeks of old money,
Ingraham's shipping-label money is so new that the ink on it might
as well still be wet, and he thinks his unvarnished quality has
made people turn on him. More than six feet tall, heavy-set with a
barrel chest and an emphatic way of speaking, he also thinks that
his love of team sports has rubbed people here the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to just grudges, because I don't fit in with
these people and their way of life,'' Ingraham said. ``I could come
in here with 10 horses and ride around sitting on a horse all day
and they wouldn't say a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DeSerio, Rosen and township officials say Ingraham can be
hard to take: The suit describes him as ``a bully'' and says he has
``a reputation for being potentially violent'' and is ``physically
threatening in size and demeanor.'' The suit contends that Ingraham
abused Rosen over the telephone, an allegation Ingraham denies.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the neighbors disapprove of the ball field.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Hannigan, former executive director of the U.S. Golf
Association and a contributor to Golf Digest magazine, said the
sounds from the Ingraham backyard are the sounds of his youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I can hear it _ it sounds like kids playing ball, like
we played when I was a kid,'' Hannigan said. ``I don't live as
close as some of the others do, and maybe if I lived where Kathy
DeSerio lives I would feel differently. But as long as it isn't a
commercial operation it doesn't bother me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DeSerio is aware that suing a man for building a baseball
field is a little like refusing to salute the flag. And she has
borne the burden of defending the neighbors' point of view alone,
since her fellow plaintiffs have refused to discuss the rhubarb.

   ``I understood when I went into this that I would subject myself
to a lot of ridicule,'' she said. ``They have made the point that I
don't have children, but that doesn't mean that I don't love

FAULT LINES OF RISK APPEAR AS MARKET HERO STUMBLES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ct., N.Y.)  (js) 
 By DIANA B. HENRIQUES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wall Street, often hard-nosed and cynical, was
utterly dazzled by John Meriwether. He was viewed as a bond trader
with a Midas touch, a mathematician of genius who saw gold nuggets
in markets where others saw only sand.
</P>
<P>
   In the giddy 1980s, he presided over a team of bond traders who
generated immense profits for Salomon Brothers with arcane
strategies that were dubbed ``rocket science.'' But in a world of
sharp tongues and sharper elbows, Meriwether was softly
self-possessed, inspiring confidence among equals and hero-worship
among underlings. A brush with scandal, as the supervisor of a
trader caught manipulating bids on Treasury securities in 1991, did
little to tarnish his gleaming reputation. When he left the firm in
February 1994, some of his best traders and two Nobel-laureate
economists followed him into a celebrated exile in Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   There, with fishing breaks when the bluefish were running,
Meriwether and his partners operated Long-Term Capital Management
LP, a largely unregulated investment pool for the wealthy called a
``hedge fund.'' By early 1998, Meriwether's team had invested $90
billion, most of it borrowed from Wall Street bankers so confident
of Meriwether's skills that a few had even sunk some of their
personal wealth into his new fund.
</P>
<P>
   And it was there that the glittering Meriwether image toppled
last week from its Wall Street pedestal and shattered. A hastily
assembled consortium of international banks and brokerage houses
took possession of the faltering firm and pumped in $3.65 billion
to prevent a disorderly collapse that could have panicked the
credit markets and sent shock waves from small-town real estate
offices to the halls of government in Brazil. If the fund had been
forced to liquidate its entire portfolio, its sales could have
undermined the value of financial contracts worth as much as $1.25
trillion.
</P>
<P>
   How one man, utterly unknown beyond his rarefied world, became
such a potent source of instability in one of the deepest, richest
markets in the world reveals how Wall Street can be seduced by
outsized success and the trappings of genius. And while the
last-minute rescue grew out of an emergency warning system that
provides some comfort to the nation's financial markets, the march
to the precipice reveals how little regulators, investors and even
traders themselves understand about the fault lines of risk buried
in today's global financial landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is too early to give the definitive answer to what the
lessons are, but clearly firms have got to look at their exposure
and leverage, and at what margins of safety they have in these
transactions,'' said Peter Bakstansky, senior vice president of the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which provided the framework for
the rescue. ``And they must have a better sense of the risk
analysis being done by their borrowers.''
</P>
<P>
   A top Wall Street executive briefed on the negotiations last
week said he was clear about the lesson for his own firm: ``We will
never let our exposure to one counterparty get to these levels
again _ never. He had gotten too big for the market. Everybody gave
him too much money.''
</P>
<P>
   In a world where the concept of ``too much money'' is met with
blank stares, John Meriwether was able to borrow heavily from more
than a dozen financial institutions, each of which was largely
unaware of how much he had borrowed from the others. Hedge funds
are private partnerships that are not required to disclose their
trading strategies, and can take money only from institutions and
wealthy individuals, on the theory that these sophisticated
investors understand the above-average risks involved.
</P>
<P>
   Meriwether's hedge fund was even more secretive than most, to
prevent rivals from copying its strategy or from anticipating its
next move. In essence, the fund placed bets that tiny deviations in
the traditional relationships between the prices of various
securities would eventually return to normal.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the interest rate on a medium-quality corporate
bond is usually about one percentage point more than the rate on a
30-year Treasury bond, reflecting the greater risk of lending to a
company than to the U.S. government. If the gap, called the spread,
widened to more than one percentage point, the Meriwether team
could bet with confidence that the relationship would ultimately
revert to normal. Myron S. Scholes and Robert C. Merton, who shared
a Nobel prize in economics, helped program powerful computers to
recognize countless similar profit opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The profit on each of these trades is so small that the
Meriwether fund had to make its money on volume. As one Solomon
Brothers veteran described it, the fund was like a roulette player
betting on red and doubling up his bets each time the wheel stops
on black. ``A gambler with $1,000 will probably lose,'' he said.
``A gambler with $1 billion will wind up owning the casino, because
it is a mathematical certainty that red will come up eventually _
but you have to have enough chips to stay at the table until that
happens.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One way the fund accumulated those chips was by borrowing at
least $20 for each $1 in capital.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of 1997, Meriwether had so many chips that he was
giving some back. Investors who had joined the fund after February
1994 were handed $2.82 for every $1 they had invested, and were
told very politely to go away. Original investors from outside the
firm _ who considered themselves the lucky ones _ took out their
profits but kept their original stakes in the fund. After all, the
fund had posted profits of 43 percent in 1995 and 41 percent in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the fund, whose capital base started at $1.2
billion, including $100 million in general partners' money, was
reduced to about $4.7 billion at the beginning of this year, from
roughly $7 billion at its peak.
</P>
<P>
   The first gust of the approaching storm came in June. The fund
was down 10 percent, its worst monthly loss ever. Early August was
even worse. As the Russian financial markets and other emerging
markets grew increasingly treacherous, investors sought the safety
of Treasury securities, pushing up Treasury prices as the prices of
most other bonds fell. Unfortunately, this pattern was the opposite
of the Meriwether team's bets, and the paper losses grew.
</P>
<P>
   Around Aug. 15, Meriwether warned his investors and trading
partners about the grim results. But with roughly $3.7 billion left
in capital, the partners were still confident they could weather
the storm, and many left on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Friday, Aug. 21 _ a terrible day for the bond market
as skittish buyers dumped corporate bonds to buy Treasury bonds,
sending Treasury rates to a 20-year low. Long-Term Capital's
general partners rushed back to their Greenwich offices, working
through the weekend and the following week to review their
positions, which had dropped 40 percent that month.
</P>
<P>
   They approached new investors. But when the stock market
plummeted on Aug. 31, any hope for new money evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 2, Meriwether invited existing investors to put in more
money to help the fund stay the course. Again, there were some
talks, but no cash.
</P>
<P>
   Around this time, one key element of the Wall Street warning
system was activated: Meriwether's clearing broker, the Bear
Stearns Companies, intensified its scrutiny of the fund's trading
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Clearing brokers execute the trades of their client firms, and
if one of those firms cannot deliver the cash or securities
required to satisfy its obligations, the clearing broker must
settle the trade with the opposite party. To reduce their own risk,
such brokers require their clearing clients to keep funds on
deposit as collateral, and they can limit trading. Bear Stearns
did, and Long-Term Capital complied, people who were briefed on
their relationship said.
</P>
<P>
   Another part of the Wall Street warning system was tripped, too.
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which monitors the key
commercial banks that serve the Wall Street community, was
questioning how much Meriwether owed to institutions under its
supervision.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Sept. 18, what had been a deeply worrisome problem
became a full-blown crisis. The triggering event is still shrouded
in official silence, but several people with sideline seats said
that Meriwether, the celebrated bond trader, was blindsided by an
unraveling stock investment. As the prices of Ciena and Tellabs
shares fell following the collapse of their merger, Long-Term
Capital had to provide additional collateral to brokers who had
lent it money to buy those shares. Federal regulations on such
transactions leave no room to wiggle.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the $3.7 billion in capital that Long-Term Capital
had in mid-August had dwindled by more than two-thirds. It had
become clear that Meriwether needed fresh money or his firm would
fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if this firm had to liquidate in distress, the
ramifications for the global marketplace would be very negative,''
one senior Wall Street executive said. How negative? ``No one felt
they could even quantify it. That's one of the things that made it
so scary.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knew exactly the magnitude of the fund's liabilities, not
even Bear Stearns, in part because the fund used complex financial
contracts, known as derivatives, whose value was difficult to
assess. But the yawning fear was that the nascent recovery in the
market for bonds _ from mortgage-backed securities that help
underwrite home purchases to the sovereign debt of Brazil _ would
be ``stopped in its tracks and turn the other way'' if Long-Term
Capital failed.
</P>
<P>
   By last Sunday afternoon, Jon Corzine, a senior partner at
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., was calling Peter Fisher, an executive vice
president of the New York Fed, and top executives at Merrill Lynch,
Union Bank of Switzerland and J. P. Morgan to discuss the scope of
the crisis brewing in Greenwich.
</P>
<P>
   Those calls helped knit together a group to solve the crisis:
Corzine; David Komansky, chairman of Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., and Herb
Allison, Merrill's president; David Solo from Union Bank of
Switzerland; and Douglas Warner, chairman of J. P. Morgan &AMP; Co.
Some of the firms had extended large lines of credit to Meriwether,
while others were equity partners or had taken the other side of
his fund's trades.
</P>
<P>
   At 7:30 on Tuesday morning, the core group conferred with Fisher
in a private dining room at the New York Fed's Italianate
headquarters on Maiden Lane, a few blocks from Wall Street. At the
same time, teams from the investment banks were dispatched to
Greenwich ``to look at the situation and find out what the
positions were,'' one top-level Wall Street executive said.
</P>
<P>
   That examination made it clear that the fund would not be able
to cover its obligations if it were forced to hurriedly liquidate
its positions.
</P>
<P>
   At 7 p.m., sleek black limousines again converged on the Fed's
headquarters. This time, the core group had invited six other banks
and brokerage houses, including Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and the
Travelers Group.
</P>
<P>
   While the Fed officials encouraged the group to come together,
the officials' role in framing the rescue effort is the subject of
considerable disagreement among the participants in the drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fed just provided the coffee and doughnuts,'' one senior
Wall Street executive said. Some of the bankers, however, have
complained privately that regulators were in fact pressuring them
to prevent the situation from worsening.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations were difficult, but the executives finally
agreed they had no alternative but to give Meriwether more money.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At 10 A.M. Wednesday, senior officers of 16 banks and brokerage
firms assembled in a Fed conference room. They waited more than a
half-hour for William McDonough, the president of the New York Fed,
who had just returned from London. At 10:40, he came in to explain
that Corzine of Goldman, Sachs might have found a buyer to come to
Long-Term Capital's rescue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in the room knew'' that the potential buyer was the
celebrated investor Warren Buffett, said one senior executive who
was briefed on the meeting. Buffett had stepped in to rescue
Salomon Brothers in 1991, after the bond trading scandal that
prompted Meriwether's departure, and his involvement would have
injected instant confidence into the marketplace. When McDonough
suggested a recess until 1 P.M., the executives left the Fed, no
doubt with their fingers crossed.
</P>
<P>
   When they returned, however, the Fed president announced that
the potential buyer had balked. Komansky of Merrill Lynch then
challenged the group: How much additional money would each firm
contribute to keep the fund alive and thereby forestall the crisis
of confidence that its collapse could produce?
</P>
<P>
   There were angry arguments and resentful speeches, reflecting
the tensions the men faced. Each executives knew that if its firm
seized its collateral from the firm and fled, only a few of them
would reach the exit before the roof fell in. But taking collective
action was difficult for such natural competitors, even with the
Fed's brooding oversight.
</P>
<P>
   Executives for Bear Stearns insisted, successfully, that their
risks as the fund's clearing broker should exempt them from further
contributions. Executives from three foreign banks initially balked
at contributing anything, provoking a lecture from a senior Wall
Street executive. The trio huddled privately, and announced they
would participate after all.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, 14 firms committed $100 million to $350 million
each. That they could do so on such short notice is one happy
result of the long, fat years in the capital markets that preceded
these last anxious months. That the rescue effort was organized so
smoothly suggests, too, that a strong habit of informal cooperation
and close consultation has been forged in past crises.
</P>
<P>
   At most, the deal bought the fund some breathing room in which
their bets may, just possibly, ripen into the extraordinary profits
that tempted them into this risky territory in the first place. But
the cost was high. The rescue was essentially an informal,
high-speed bankruptcy reorganization that turned Long-Term
Capital's creditors into its new owners, who will oversee every
aspect of the restructured firm's existence.
</P>
<P>
   When the rescue package was reported to Meriwether in Greenwich
at around 7 p.m. on Wednesday, he gathered his exhausted partners
in his office and explained the deal, as he understood it. The
partners in the room, and those listening by telephone in Tokyo and
London, were calm as their future took an unexpected and personally
painful twist.
</P>
<P>
   Honeymoons would be canceled, weddings postponed. Homes under
construction might never be finished, and once-glittering
reputations might be lost forever.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of last week, Meriwether and his partners retained a
sliver of equity in the firm that they built on genius and panache.
Their 180 employees _ most of whom had invested each year's bonuses
in the fund _ were left with little more than uncertain jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But regulators and others are left pondering how a small band of
traders could threaten the confidence that knits together the
world's financial markets.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Brushing aside a veto threat from President
Clinton, the House passed an $80 billion Republican tax cut
Saturday that would be paid for by projected federal budget
surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   The vote put Republicans a step closer to a politically charged
election-year showdown with the White House and congressional
Democrats over an issue that both sides believe will play to their
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said a portion of the excess revenue expected to
flow to the government in coming years should be returned to
taxpayers, in part to keep Washington from spending it.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Clinton, Democrats have framed the issue as one of fiscal
responsibility, saying that to spend any surpluses before they
materialize would be reckless and endanger efforts to address the
Social Security system's long-term financial problems. Since
January, Clinton has been demanding that Congress set aside every
penny of the surplus until it has agreed with the administration on
a plan to shore up Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would provide a tax break for many middle-income
married couples, exempt some interest and dividend payments from
taxation, reduce inheritance taxes, accelerate a plan to allow the
self-employed to deduct 100 percent of their health insurance
premiums and extend a credit for research undertaken by
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's House vote was largely along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation now goes to the Senate, where its prospects are
uncertain. Because of the parliamentary rules that will apply to
the bill in the Senate, it will require 60 votes for passage, a
hurdle that Republicans, who hold 55 seats, said would be difficult
to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans, who earlier this year voted to cut taxes $30
billion over five years, could scale back the House bill to try to
win votes from wavering Democrats, although no decision has yet
been made. Some Republicans have also weighed attaching the tax
bill to a package of spending bills to make it more difficult for
Democrats to vote against it and to raise the stakes should it come
to a presidential veto.
</P>
<P>
   Battered and strained by Clinton's struggle for political
survival, Democrats were clearly happy to turn attention to an
issue that could help unify the party and spur more Democrats to
turn out at the polls in November. Republicans said the tax burden
on citizens, measured as a percentage of total economic activity,
was at its highest level since World War II. They said that cutting
taxes would help move power out of Washington and back to states
and communities while reining in Washington's predilection for
ever-larger spending on social programs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has already broken his own pledge to put Social Security
first by proposing to use the surplus to pay for emergency spending
next year for farm relief, increased security at American embassies
and the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, Republicans said. Moreover,
they said, the projected federal budget surpluses are so large that
there is plenty of room for a tax cut without limiting the options
for dealing with the looming crisis in Social Security, which will
run short of money to pay benefits when the baby-boom generation
retires over the next three decades.
</P>
<P>
   They said their plan would leave most of the surplus _ projected
by the Congressional Budget Office to be $520 billion over the next
five years and $1.55 trillion over the next 10 years _ free to help
address Social Security's looming difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has come to admit tax-and-spend has failed,'' said
Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, who wrote the tax bill. ``It's time to
reduce the size of government and to let people keep their tax
dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   But most Democrats stuck closely to their party line that now is
not the time for tax cuts. They said that all the projected surplus
for the next five years, and nearly all for the next decade, will
come from excess payroll tax payments that are earmarked for Social
Security's trust funds.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Social Security surplus is stripped out of the overall
surplus calculations, the Democrats said, there is nothing left to
pay for a tax cut, making the Republican plan a threat to the
nation's long-term fiscal health.
</P>
<P>
   ``The passage of this bill will make solving the Social Security
problem more difficult, plain and simple,'' said Rep. Benjamin
Cardin, D-Md. ``We're raiding Social Security. Without Social
Security we have no surplus.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The issue is already showing up in congressional races around
the country. The AFL-CIO, a major source of support for Democrats
as they struggle to keep Republicans from picking up more seats in
the wake of Clinton's troubles, said it began running television
commercials in 20 congressional districts last week trying to rally
support against the tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The commercials show a middle-aged couple paying their bills and
talking about retirement. It ends by urging voters and their
elected representatives to oppose ``this tax scheme'' and ``put
Social Security first.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said Democrats were relying on scare tactics.
``Social Security will be protected,'' said Rep. Sam Johnson,
R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Although the bill has provisions to benefit big business and the
wealthy, its was written by Republicans to appeal to the middle
class, and many Democrats said they would have supported it if it
did not require dipping into the surplus. The cuts would be worth
about $80 billion over five years and $177 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans ``have hijacked Democratic tax cut ideas and then
made it impossible for us to vote for them because their bill
drains the Social Security trust fund,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel,
D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's centerpiece is a reduction in the so-called marriage
penalty, the quirk in the tax code that causes many two-income
couples to pay a bigger tax bill than they would if single.
</P>
<P>
   The penalty primarily affects couples in which the two partners
have roughly equal incomes. But the bill would provide a break to
all couples who file jointly and claim the standard deduction by
increasing the standard deduction for couples filing jointly so
that it is double the deduction for single filers.
</P>
<P>
   The second-biggest provision in the bill would be an
acceleration of a planned reduction in the estate tax, a change
that would benefit the heirs of individuals who have amassed
considerable wealth. The provision would increase to $1 million
from $600,000 the amount that can be exempted from federal estate
taxes, starting Jan. 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also exempt from taxation the first $400 in
interest and dividend income for couples filing jointly, or $200
for single filers.

JAPANESE LEADERS AND OPPOSITION PATCH UP PLAN FOR BANK RESCUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Japan's governing party and the opposition patched up a
basic agreement Saturday on legislation to revive the banking
system. The latest agreement, if it sticks, may dispel concerns
that Japan's political paralysis will continue to hobble its
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The parties had reached an agreement earlier, on Sept. 18, but
it began unraveling just as Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and
President Clinton were meeting in New York on Tuesday to discuss
global economic problems. Markets here and around the world had
been concerned that if the deal fell apart completely, Japan's
economic troubles would worsen and spread around the world.
</P>
<P>
   With Saturday's agreement, a set of long-awaited financial laws
could be passed by the Parliament by Oct. 7, when the current
Parliament session ends. The new laws would set up a mechanism for
strengthening Japan's banks, dealing with large bank failures and
confronting the problem of bad loans that are at the heart of
Japan's economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an epoch-making moment,'' said Naoto Kan, head of the
Democratic Party, the main opposition, according to the newspaper
Asahi Shimbun.
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. officials are likely to be relieved that a deal has
been struck, they may not be entirely pleased with its terms.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few days, U.S. officials, from Clinton on down, have
been calling on Japan to use public funds to rescue failing banks
and thereby avert a possible large-scale panic. Saturday's
agreement, however, specifies that the government will not use
taxpayers' money to bail out the Long-Term Credit Bank, one of the
world's largest and weakest financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the government will nationalize the bank by purchasing
common shares in the bank at a low price. The question of using
taxpayers' money to boost the capital base of ailing banks before
they go under has been a nagging crucial question over the last few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The terms of the deal are still a bit unclear. But it seems that
for now the government will not move to bail out banks unless they
are on the verge of collapse and may not be able to repay
depositors. If a bank is that desperate, then the government
presumably will intervene by nationalizing the bank.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also calls for the government to examine how
taxpayers' money could be used to increase the capital of weak
banks that are still viable.
</P>
<P>
   Under Saturday's agreement, the Long-Term Credit Bank would
temporarily be put under state control. It might then be
transformed into a bridge bank that would separate out the good
loans and worthy borrowers and sell or try to collect on the bad
loans. The government would then try to resell the viable part of
the bank to another institution, and not necessarily to Sumitomo
Trust &AMP; Banking Corp., which announced several months ago that it
would merge with Long-Term Credit.
</P>
<P>
   Another contentious issue has been the call by the opposition
groups to eviscerate the financial policy-making powers of the
influential Finance Ministry. In Saturday's deal, the two sides
agreed to draw up within the next 10 days or so a two-stage plan
for the devolution of power. Negotiators were apparently still
hashing out the measures and offered few details.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a special committee will be formed, reporting directly to
the prime minister, and, over time, much of the powers from the
Finance Ministry would be transferred to an expanded version of
this committee.

MACAU, AWAITING HANDOVER TO BEIJING, IS WORRIED ABOUT CHINESE
TROOPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MARK LANDLER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MACAU _ For years, the looming reversion of this Portuguese
colony to China has been little remarked on and largely forgotten _
a bit of colonial housekeeping lost in the wake of Hong Kong's
momentous handover from Britain.
</P>
<P>
   But now, this other handover is suddenly generating some drama
of its own. The Chinese government announced in early September
that it planned to deploy troops in Macau after it takes possession
of the colony on Dec. 20, 1999. The decision is an about-face for
Beijing, which has long said it did not see the need to establish a
garrison on this 14-square-mile patch of land on its southeast
coast.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing's surprise move is not playing well with Macau's
lame-duck leaders. The Portuguese governor of Macau, Gen. Vasco
Rocha Vieira, said China was putting a ``new interpretation'' on
the 1987 joint declaration that set the terms for Macau's handover.
The deal, he noted, said nothing about soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Portugal ratcheted up its disapproval. A senior
adviser to the Portuguese prime minister said in an interview with
Macau's leading Portuguese-language newspaper that there was ``no
need'' to station troops in the territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Portugal and China may be entering a new phase in their
relations,'' said Fok Kai Cheong, a history professor at the
University of Macau.
</P>
<P>
   China insists it has a right to deploy troops because, after the
handover, it will be responsible for Macau's national security and
defense. When China took control of Hong Kong last year, several
truckloads of troops from the People's Liberation Army immediately
rolled across the border. Most of the soldiers promptly disappeared
into their barracks and have not been spotted since.
</P>
<P>
   But several experts noted that the relationship between China
and Portugal is very different from that between China and Britain.
Portugal established Macau in 1557, more than two centuries before
British ships dropped anchor in Hong Kong. And while Portugal has
been more amenable about giving up its last foothold in Asia, it
has its own sensitivities and points of contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all very well to have troops in Hong Kong, but Macau is
much smaller,'' Fok said. ``How do you do it here?''
</P>
<P>
   Although China and Britain quarreled over many aspects of Hong
Kong's handover, the deployment of troops was not one of them.
Because Britain had always maintained a garrison in the territory,
it seemed a foregone conclusion that China would replace the
British soldiers with its own.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal, by contrast, has had a generally harmonious
relationship with China. But experts here said the deployment of
troops has struck a nerve with Portugal because it withdrew its own
soldiers from the enclave in 1974, after the Portuguese revolution.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Legal experts said that while there were no provisions in the
Chinese-Portuguese Joint Declaration stipulating that troops be
deployed, there were also no prohibitions against a Chinese
military presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the presence of troops, it's likely to be more
symbolic,'' said Nuno Riquito, a professor of law at the University
of Macau.
</P>
<P>
   What concerns people here is the timing: China has decided to
send in troops just as Macau's gang wars are flaring up again.
China's deputy prime minister, Qian Qichen, said Beijing was ``very
concerned'' about security in the enclave. Although Qian said law
enforcement was Macau's responsibility, he said the presence of
troops would contribute to stability.
</P>
<P>
   That has fed suspicions that China plans to use the army more
for law and order than defense. If true, experts said such a policy
would violate Portugal's handover agreement, which _ like Hong
Kong's _ guarantees the enclave a high degree of autonomy in
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that Beijing is not likely to play by the
law,'' said Ng Kuok Cheong, a legislator who is a sort of one-man
opposition party. ``The troops may behave themselves in 1999. But
what about 50 years later?''

LAWS RULE IN INQUIRY, NOT POLLS, GOP SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans in Congress insist that they will not
be deterred in their investigation of President Clinton by polls
last week showing the public's disapproval.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't affect what we do,'' said Rep. Bill McCollum of
Florida, a senior Republican on the Judiciary Committee. ``We are
determined to do this fairly and objectively and not listen to the
polls at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde of, R-Ill., the committee's chairman, asserted,
``We're very blessed to live in a nation of laws, not governed by
opinion polls influenced by political spin.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest New York Times/CBS News poll shows that in the past
week, as the public's scrutiny of the congressional inquiry has
intensified, the percentage of adults who view Congress favorably
has fallen to 48 percent from 56 percent, and the percentage of
those who disapprove of the way Congress is handling its job has
increased to 41 percent from 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more important, large majorities of those interviewed in
the poll disapprove of the way the Judiciary Committee is handling
the inquiry, believe the Republicans have been unfairly partisan
and think important work of the government is being sidetracked by
the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 4 of 5 adults said it was unnecessary for Congress to
release President Clinton's videotaped testimony to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   These findings did not take lawmakers by surprise. ``Whenever
things get partisan up here, the public gets turned off,'' said
Rep. John Boehner of Ohio, the fourth-ranking member of the House
Republican leadership.
</P>
<P>
   After the Watergate investigation and President Richard M.
Nixon's resignation 1974, Congress rose in public esteem. Many
credited Congress with saving the American system of government.
</P>
<P>
   But more recently, the more Congress has been in the limelight,
the more its ratings have dropped.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the public's opinion of Congress fell in the
Iran-Contra hearings in 1987 and after the hearings on the Supreme
Court nomination of Clarence Thomas and the sexual harassment
accusations against him involving Anita Hill in 1991. Those
hearings, like the videotape of the Clinton testimony, were
television spectacles.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats in Congress and presumably Clinton and his staff
are hoping that if the trend in public opinion continues to run
against Congress, it will prove to be a life preserver for the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Dingell of Michigan, who has been in the House since
1955, said that his ``well-tuned set of guts'' told him that
Congress' lower standing in the polls ``is one of the things
Clinton is pinning his hopes on.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Vic Fazio of California, the third-ranking member of the
Democratic leadership in the House, said: ``Republicans seem to
think there's an unending appetite in the country for this scandal.
That's a misreading of the American people.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a large enough majority comes to feel that they are
overstepping their bounds and being too partisan,'' Fazio said,
``that might lead the Republicans to back off.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans said they were undaunted. They took their cue
from Speaker Newt Gingrich, who said Wednesday, ``I think people
would be, frankly, horrified if the Congress was simply a polling
institution that enacted a grotesque version of justice based on
the latest poll or talk show.''
</P>
<P>
   Prof. Richard Fenno, a political scientist at the University of
Rochester who specializes in Congress, said it was hard for him to
imagine that Republicans would continue down the impeachment trail
on a partisan basis in the face of public disapproval. But he
quickly added that the Republicans' track record in this regard was
so sparse that he could not be sure how they would respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were out of power for so long and are so inexperienced at
governing that they've had an occasional tin ear when it came to
looking at public opinion,'' Fenno said.

CLINTON, MOST CHARMING AT A DISTANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To meet Bill Clinton is to like him, even his
enemies agree. But to know him is not necessarily to love him, even
his friends acknowledge.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it is the people who know this president best _ from
his own former aides to his wary fellow Democrats in Congress _ who
have been most disappointed and angry about his handling of the
Monica Lewinsky matter, and who have held it against him more
harshly than a detached and distant public.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has long been convinced that if he could simply meet
every voter in person, he would win in a landslide, and that is how
he has always campaigned _ hand to hand, eye to eye, with galvanic
effect. Even now, a sympathetic public overwhelmingly approves of
his performance in office, although barely half of those surveyed
think he can be trusted to keep his word.
</P>
<P>
   But among those on Capitol Hill who have borne the burden of the
president's broken word personally in the past _ on questions of
legislative policy or political strategy _ an abiding bitterness
lingers, in a way that has made it hard for the White House to
rally much personal support for the president with party leaders as
he strives to head off an impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some who deal with him find themselves _ and here I
use a term advisedly _ seduced by him,'' said Robert Reich,
Clinton's former secretary of labor and a friend since their days
as Rhodes scholars 30 years ago. ``And then a day or two, or a
week, or a month later, they wonder where he is, why he's not
calling them, or why he's not as close a chum as his charm had
suggested. So he may confuse some people, and this is in addition
to keeping some distance from the congressional Democrats on policy
grounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton got off to a rocky start with Congress in 1993, when he
pressed House Democrats to pass a controversial energy tax based on
the number of British thermal units, or BTUs, generated by various
fuels. When Senate Democrats opposed the idea, Clinton promptly
dropped it, and angry House Democrats began vowing that they would
never again be ``BTUed.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Clinton passed his deficit-reduction plan in 1993 by
a single vote, but then, two years later at a fund raiser with
wealthy Texans, declared that he thought the measure had raised
taxes too much, leading Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., to
declare: ``He doesn't understand that he's conceding the
principles.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially since the failure of his proposed health care
overhaul and the Republican takeover of Congress in 1994, Clinton
has pursued an individualized politics of ``triangulation'' that
seeks to straddle the orthodoxies of both parties. This has
particularly alienated the Democratic leadership in the House,
which is more reflexively liberal on issues from trade to welfare
than he is.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, to the surprise and disappointment of his
aides, Clinton has largely failed to develop many close personal
relationships on Capitol Hill, or to exploit the political
potential of the White House as ``the single greatest home-court
advantage in the modern world,'' as Michael Douglas' character
described it in the movie ``The American President.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic members complain about slights large and small, from
not being asked to movies at the White House to discovering that
White House aides were using the House Democratic leader's office
to lobby Republicans on budget legislation last year, while keeping
Democrats in the dark. That so angered aides to the leader, Rep.
Dick Gephardt of Missouri, that they pulled out the telephone lines
in their office that are normally reserved for White House use.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a personal basis, the Clinton relationships on the Hill are
just practically nil,'' said one person who is close to Gephardt,
speaking on the condition of anonymity. ``The thing that drives
Dick absolutely crazy is that every time they have a conversation,
Clinton spends all his time talking about polling numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Democratic senator, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, put it a bit differently, saying, ``In my whole
experience, I've never known any presidency with as little
relationship up here, and the relationships they do have have
tended to be with people who told them what they wanted to hear _
which was not what they needed to know.''
</P>
<P>
   The House Democrats' biggest complaint is that Clinton's
problems seem all but certain to keep them from winning back a
majority in their chamber, something that seemed possible just
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is hardly the first president to have rocky relations
with his own party. One former Democratic speaker of the House, the
late Tip O'Neill, used to complain that he was invited to the White
House more often in the first few months of Ronald Reagan's tenure
than in all of Jimmy Carter's four years. But Clinton's qualities
of personal gregariousness would seem to make him well suited to
socializing in a way that Carter never could.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mystery to me,'' said the historian Doris Kearns
Goodwin, who has written about presidents from Franklin D.
Roosevelt to Lyndon B. Johnson. ``You'd think his natural
temperament would be totally at ease schmoozing with these
characters on the Hill, playing cards or whatever. Those kinds of
moments together transcend political battles and forge friendships
that will come to the fore in difficult times.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One senior aide to the Democratic leadership said of the
president: ``Look who he hangs out with. Hollywood types.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an irony of Clinton's reputation for friendship _ and his
lifelong card-file of thousands of ``Friends of Bill'' _ that he
has virtually no intimates, especially among his political peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He likes people to be his audience,'' said one longtime friend
and adviser. ``He loves to tell stories, to have long discourses.
But that's different from a relationship that's based on mutuality,
in which there's a kind of genuine exchange. He loves to charm, to
conquer, to get people to admire and love him. But that's a
different set of human interactions than friendship. It's a one-way
charm street.''
</P>
<P>
   Another acquaintance of the president described how the power he
exuded on initial greeting faded after a long dinner, in which
Clinton held forth at length, but never really asked his dinner
partner's opinions. In sum, Clinton's celebrated empathy may be
most effective from a distance.
</P>
<P>
   When Democrats finally began to rally last week, it was against
the perceived excesses of their Republican colleagues far more than
in support of Clinton, and Gephardt has told the Democratic caucus
that his first allegiance is to them and their re-election
campaigns, and only second to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional aides say relations with the Democrats were better
when Leon Panetta, a former nine-term congressman from California,
was White House chief of staff, and Panetta is now among those
sounding out congressional prospects for some punishment short of
impeachment. But even under Panetta, senior Democratic aides said,
members learned that the president had decided to sign the giant
welfare bill in 1996 only by watching Clinton announce it to the
world on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Some distance was all but inevitable, since Clinton campaigned
in 1992 not only as an outsider, but as a candidate who aimed to
blend the best of left and right to achieve bold change in fields
from health care to welfare to education. But by the time of his
1996 re-election campaign, Clinton had decided that the way to save
himself was to abandon many of his and his party's most ambitious
goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The triangulation strategy was an implicit repudiation of the
Democrats' agenda,'' Reich said. ``The president positioned himself
in such a way that would be seen somehow as above partisan
politics. In point of fact, the V-chip and school uniforms and the
rest didn't add up to much. It was more of a mood. There's not a
core constituency ready to fall on its sword because no mandate has
been established.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is perhaps no accident that one of Clinton's senior
advisers responded to the president's confession in the Lewinsky
case by complaining, ``I care more about his agenda than he does,''
or that George Stephanopoulos, the former aide who best read his
boss' moods and absorbed his anger, has now become one of his
harshest critics.
</P>
<P>
   One former senior aide, in trying to explain why Clinton's
charms fade with familiarity, said: ``I just think it's the huge
capacity to disappoint It's all wrapped up in his strengths. He
makes you feel so good, which makes you feel so bad.''

<P>
   ``A nation of Clinton Enablers?'' a headline in The New York
Post queried. ``We have all been enablers for Bill Clinton,''
declared Time magazine. Last week, an editorial in this newspaper
spoke of Clinton's ``documentably dysfunctional personality'' and
warned that ``we must not become a nation of enablers.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent speech, the television evangelist (and sometime
Clinton counselor) Robert Schuller asserted that ``we all share
part of the shame'' for stubbornly high public approval ratings
that have enabled President Clinton so far to avoid confronting the
problem of his sexual behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The American electorate has been called many things from the
pulpit and in editorial pages. ``Enabling, to describe the behavior
of a nation, though _ that's a new one,'' said Dr. Stanton Peele,
an author and clinical psychologist who has studied what he regards
as the two-decade-long march of the therapeutic ideal and its
clinical concepts from personal behavior into ever-wider areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've developed a tendency in America to describe every
personal transaction in clinical terms,'' he said. ``So I guess, in
the spirit of our times, if you're applying a clinical label to all
unwanted behavior, you could apply the label `enabler' to people
who continue to support Bill Clinton.'' The term has recently been
applied to those close to the president like Hillary Rodham
Clinton, Betty Currie, his secretary, and his friend Vernon Jordan.
(Grand jury testimony from the latter two is expected to be made
public this week, so watch for it to crop up again.) But when
commentators and clerics start using enabling to describe behavior
by the general electorate, ``we're entering a pretty rarefied
realm,'' said Peele.
</P>
<P>
   Some find it hard to suppress a chuckle. ``A whole nation full
of enablers? Is anyone treating it? What an opportunity,'' joked
Tana Dineen, a psychologist in Ontario and the author of
``Manufacturing Victims: What the Psychology Industry Is Doing to
People'' (Robert Davies Multimedia Publishing, 1996).
</P>
<P>
   Enabler is a noun used in clinical and support-group settings to
label someone who is close to (and often diagnosed as clinically
``co-dependent'' with) an alcoholic or other presumed addict, and
whose love and emotional support allow the sufferer to deny the
addiction and avoid seeking treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The clinical concepts of co-dependency and enabling began
flourishing in the early 1980s, when employee health insurance
coverage was widely expanded to cover treatment for addiction and
other mental health problems. Best-selling self-help books, intense
media coverage and lobbying by therapists soon widened the range of
what were considered to be clinical addictions _ compulsive
gambling, shopping and sexual behavior among them.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, enabling has gradually moved from the clinical
to the cultural vocabulary, said Peele, who in 1989 decried what he
called America's ``treatment binge'' in ``The Diseasing of America:
Addiction Treatment Out of Control'' (Lexington Books). Now, he
said, the term seems to be metastasizing again _ into the civic
vocabulary of politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're enablers because we haven't risen up to demand that
Clinton seek clinical treatment,'' he said. ``That's a pretty
whimsical concept.'' In Vogue
</P>
<P>
   As a purported disease, sex addiction is in vogue. Though not
yet classified as a specific disorder in the American Psychiatric
Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, it is being widely
treated as a compulsive disorder in proliferating sex-addiction
support groups and clinical settings. In print and on television,
leading sex-addiction therapists routinely assert that as many as
70 percent of American men suffer from some form of diagnosable
sexual compulsion. And as with in any clinical addiction, it is
concurrently assumed that a significant number of a non-confessed
sex-addict's loved ones, acquaintances and even co-workers are
``enabling'' the denial to seek treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Asserting that the American public is ``enabling'' Clinton's
behavior is ``sort of the equivalent of describing the entire
American society as being addicted or clinically co-dependent,''
said Peele. ``Does that mean that all of America now has to enter
therapy?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, in a manner of speaking, replied Dr. Jerome D. Levin, a
psychotherapist and the author of ``The Clinton Syndrome: The
President and the Self-Destructive Nature of Sexual Addiction''
(Prima Publishing, 1998). The book argues that Clinton is a
clinically addicted sex addict in denial who has been ill-served by
the enabling behavior of family and associates.
</P>
<P>
   The president, suggested Levin, who trains alcohol- and
substance-abuse counselors at the New School for Social Research in
New York, should ``put aside the spin doctors and lawyers,'' invoke
the 25th Amendment, and enter a ``rehab program'' for addiction
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the president were to drop his denial and get appropriate
help, then I think the public would finally come to realize that in
supporting him, whatever other valid reasons we might have had for
that support, we were in fact enabling his behavior, in a way
similar to a wife who stays in a destructive relationship with an
alcoholic.''
</P>
<P>
   Laughing, Levin added: ``Then, if you really want a reductio ad
absurdum, the president could return to work and invoke the
Americans with Disabilities Act, meaning he couldn't be fired for
his disability. It would drive the right-wing lunatic fringe
nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   But the increasingly pseudo-clinical tone of the discourse on
Clinton's problems is dismaying to Wendy Kaminer, the author of
``I'm Dysfunctional, You're Dysfunctional: The Recovery Movement
and Other Self-Help Fashions'' (Addison Wesley, 1992), a book that
skeptically described the intervention of therapy into ever-wider
areas of social behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Posing the question, `Are we enabling him to continue his sex
addiction?' presumes that there is in fact such a thing as sex
addiction,'' said Ms. Kaminer. ``More importantly, it presumes we
are all collectively engaged in a personal relationship with the
president. We are not. It's a political relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``To even ask that question is a measure of how much the
therapeutic culture has distorted the political culture,'' she
added. ``It's a terrible distraction from the questions we ought to
be asking about what's really happening to the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, she said, ``People are much more knowledgeable
about popular therapy and pop psychology than they are about
politics,'' and are thus are more fluent in the jargon of pop
psychology than in the vocabulary of civics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all love to gossip and we love to personalize
relationships. We love soap operas. It's hardly a coincidence that
of all the Clinton scandals, which are arguably more serious
business, the one that has really resonated has been the one about
sex.''

<P>
   Pakistan and India promised to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban
treaty, which bars nuclear testing. Both countries have some
reservations, however, and both have prime ministers with wobbly
political bases. And India's military ambitions under a Hindu
nationalist government remain unclear.

   U.N. WARNING TO SERBS
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations Security Council ordered Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to stop Serbian attacks on civilians in the
ethnically Albanian Kosovo region, and demanded that both sides
start talking. In sending its warning, the Council _ minus China _
papered over big differences about whether outside military
intervention will be necessary to stop the Serb-dominated Yugoslav
army from attacking civilians while battling Albanian separatists.
</P>
<P>
   The Council is using the same tactic against Saddam Hussein of
Iraq, putting on a common front to prevent troublemakers from
exploiting divisions among the most powerful nations. The hard part
is deciding what to do if the bluff fails.

   PENTAGON'S POLICY ON GAYS IS UPHELD
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has declined so far to take up the
constitutionality of the military's ``don't ask, don't tell''
policy. But the court may get another opportunity after a ruling by
a federal appeals court, which said the policy does not violate
homosexuals' rights.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, which said free speech and equal protection have
traditionally been more curtailed in the armed forces than in
civilian life, upheld the military's recent policy allowing
homosexuals to serve if they keep their sexual orientation a
private matter.

   POVERTY RATES FALL
</P>
<P>
   In a welcome bit of good news for the Clinton administration,
the Census Bureau reported that the proportion of Americans living
in poverty declined last year, a drop largely attributed to
progress made by black and Hispanic families.
</P>
<P>
   The overall rate was 13.3 percent in 1997, down from 13.7
percent the year before. Clinton said the statistics vindicated his
economic policies.

   READING TEA LEAVES
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan and Keizo Obuchi have almost nothing in common.
Except that the Federal Reserve chairman and the new Japanese prime
minister both enjoy reputations for making public comments that
leave investors puzzled.
</P>
<P>
   What investors heard from Greenspan last week was a slippery
statement that, ``We have to bring the existing instabilities to a
level of stability reasonably shortly'' before the global economic
turmoil really rocks America. The world immediately assumed that
the Fed will cut interest rates on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Obuchi. Before meeting President Clinton in New
York to discuss Japan's banking crisis, he said, ``Instead of `too
little too late' we want to deal with this in ways that people say
`too big, too fast.'''
</P>
<P>
   Even Clinton's economic team had a hard time faking much
optimism at those words. ``You have to remember, we've been in
office six years and we've already met six Japanese prime
ministers,'' one noted.

   NEW EMBASSY FUNDS SOUGHT
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration asked Congress for $1.8 billion for
emergency safeguards to protect the country's 260 embassies and
consulates. The spending, if approved, would nearly double the
total amount lawmakers have appropriated for security since 1985,
and reflects the administration's conclusion no overseas mission is
safe from terrorism since the embassy bombings in Kenya and
Tanzania last month.

   Russia and the International Monetary Fund have never liked each
other, but now neither side is hiding it. The new Russian
government declared that unless it got more aid from the IMF it
might default on its international obligations. The IMF said that
it wouldn't tolerate ``blackmail,'' and that if Russia wants loans,
it might think about collecting some taxes and turning off the
printing presses that are spitting out rubles and creating
hyperinflation.

   SMUT? NOT IN THIS MAN'S ARMY!

<P>
   Military stores at bases around the world began pulling from
their shelves more than 150 magazines that the Pentagon decided are
sexually explicit.
</P>
<P>
   Playboy survived the cut. But lesser-known periodicals like
Kinky Fetishes, Barely Legal and D-Cup, were sent packing _ brown
paper wrappers and all _ banished to what the Defense Department
called its ``adult sophisticate'' list.
</P>
<P>
   The Military Honor and Decency Act, imposed by Congress two
years ago, bars the military from selling in its stores any film,
video or publication that ``depicts or describes nudity, including
sexual or excretory activities or organs, in a lascivious way.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Pentagon was blocked from carrying out the law after a
lawsuit was filed by Bob Guccione, the publisher of Penthouse
(which is on the banned list), who argued that the legislation
violated freedom of speech. Guccione's effort failed earlier this
year when the U.S. Supreme Court refused to review the case.
</P>
<P>
   That cleared the way for the Pentagon to start yanking offending
titles from store shelves. And while it's not yet on the banned
list, some lawmakers say the Whitewater independent counsel's
445-page report, with all its sexually explicit material, would
almost certainly qualify.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Starr report would not pass this test,'' said Rep. Roscoe
Bartlett, R-Md., who wrote the bill. ``I can't believe military
mothers would want their 10-year-old's reading it.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is saying that GIs can't buy reading material like
Naughty Neighbors or Nude Readers' Wives anymore. They just can't
buy them at base commissaries or exchanges.

   MAYBE IT'S JUST A COINCIDENCE ...

<P>
   For conspiracy theorists, the grassy knoll is already passe, as
is the identity of Deep Throat. But what about those new $20 bills
the Treasury Department started shipping last week _ 2 billion of
them _ with the oversized mug of Andrew Jackson?
</P>
<P>
   President Jackson, of course, was the only occupant of the White
House to be censured by Congress. Surely, there must be a
subliminal message here, one aimed at the millions of Monica-weary
Americans who will start pulling the new bills out of ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, introducing the
bills, DID say, ``Look at your cash and pay more attention to its
feel and appearance.''
</P>
<P>
   While you're looking, don't forget the vast West Wing
conspiracy. The reverse side of the bill shows the north side of
the White House, which faces Pennsylvania Avenue, instead of the
south side, which graced the old bill. The engravers carefully
cropped out the president's offices in the West Wing, to say
nothing of the Northwest Gate, where, according to Kenneth Starr's
report, Monica Lewinsky once threw a fit.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the Treasury says it began designing the new
bill in June 1986, during the Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a job for Oliver Stone.

<P>
   For an outstanding athlete to die at age 38, her world records
still unbroken, as Florence Griffith Joyner did last week, is a
blunt reminder that fine physical condition is no guarantee of
longevity.
</P>
<P>
   As when the runner and author Jim Fixx died at 52 of a heart
attack while jogging 14 years ago, an athlete's early death raises
the question of whether too much exercise strains the heart or
other parts of the body, like running a machine beyond its
endurance levels. After all, exercise requires metabolism, and
metabolism generates free radicals, those harmful reactive
chemicals that vitamin pills and other supplements are said to
combat.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that vigorous sports may actually be bad for you is
hardly new or illogical. Every tale of a former football player
with brain damage or bad knees can reinforce a popular notion that
a life committed to strenuous athletics carries bodily stress to
unhealthy levels.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no evidence that exercise in itself reduces life
span. The truth seems to be that athletes who die young, in
general, have perished from one of the usual causes of premature
death. (Drug use is one.)
</P>
<P>
   Hard exercise, unfortunately, seems to be rather good for the
body, however much pain and perspiration is involved. Doctors in
ancient times believed that vigorous exercise was harmful. And even
though the Italian physician Bernadino Ramazzini of Modena observed
in 1700 that fleet-footed messengers were healthier than sedentary
tailors and cobblers, the orthodox medical suspicion of heavy
exercise was not dispelled until the 1930s. That was when
physicians concerned about the health and longevity of university
oarsmen in England and America found to their surprise that the
oarsmen were living longer than the general population.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent studies have yielded mixed results. Professional
baseball players were found to live no longer than the average Joe.
But Finnish endurance athletes lived six years longer than average
conscripts and power sportsmen an extra year and a half.
</P>
<P>
   Faster. Farther. Better.
</P>
<P>
   The present advice from health authorities that we should all
exercise more rests largely on a continuing survey of 52,000 men
who entered Harvard or the University of Pennsylvania between 1916
and 1950. The survey, by Dr. Ralph Paffenbarger of the Stanford
University School of Medicine, shows that men who exercise hard and
regularly tend to live longer.
</P>
<P>
   Expending 2,000 calories a week in vigorous activity _ the
equivalent of jogging or walking briskly for 20 miles _ bought a 25
percent reduction in the chance of dying during the study period,
Paffenbarger has found. The effect was progressive at least up to
3,500 calories (35 miles) a week.
</P>
<P>
   Can the body actually wear out from excessive exercise? ``We do
not find any hazardous level of exercise,'' Paffenbarger said,
though he noted that even the most vigorous athletes in his study
tend to exercise less as they grow older.
</P>
<P>
   Star college athletes who have become sedentary live no longer
than anyone else, Paffenbarger has found. But men who take up
exercise later in life appear to gain the same benefits as lifelong
exercisers. Paffenbarger's rule of thumb is that for each hour of
vigorous physical activity, you get an extra two or three hours of
life.
</P>
<P>
   That may not seem so great a deal, but exercise affects more
than just the quantity of life. It also improves its quality by
making people feel healthier. It lowers the heart rate and blood
pressure, increases the high density lipoprotein in the blood and
decreases the low density lipoprotein. All of that is known to be
good for the cardiovascular system.
</P>
<P>
   Many people lack the time or inclination to jog 20 miles a week,
and health experts _ rather than delivering sermons they know will
be ignored _ have taken to preaching that even moderate exercise is
good. Though Paffenbarger's figures provide no evidence that
moderate exercise prolongs life, moderate exercise produces the
same kind of cardiovascular changes, though to a lesser degree, as
occur in vigorous exercise. Thus it seems a reasonable bet that
moderate exercise is better than none.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Fixx took up running because his father died of a heart
attack at 43; he himself lived until age 52. It's sad that any
athlete should die in the prime of life. But without all that
physical activity, death might strike even more prematurely.

COMMENTARY: WHAT PRIVACY RIGHTS?

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A recent report out of Washington tells a story about Dr. Louis
Hafken, a psychiatrist in Providence, R.I., who received a letter
from a company that reviews prescription drug benefits for insurers
and employers.
</P>
<P>
   The letter contained what should have been confidential
information about one of Hafken's patients, including a printout of
her prescription records. It noted that she was taking Ativan, an
anti-anxiety drug. The company wanted to know why. Was the patient
depressed, or suffering from panic disorder, or experiencing
alcohol withdrawal? Did the doctor plan to continue giving her
Ativan?
</P>
<P>
   The doctor did not provide the requested information.
``Frankly,'' he was quoted as saying, ``it's none of their
business.''
</P>
<P>
   The patient was naturally upset to learn that her employer had
examined the records of her psychiatric treatment. The implications
of such snooping are obvious. Hafken said many of his patients
``are afraid to be completely honest in therapy'' because they fear
that people other than their doctors will learn of matters that
were supposed to have remained secret.
</P>
<P>
   They have reason to be worried. We are very close to the day
when strangers will know, or will be able to know, anything they
want about you.
</P>
<P>
   Your financial profile and buying habits have long since been
catalogd and traded like baseball cards. Your medical records,
supposedly secure, are not. Your boss may well be monitoring your
telephone conversations and e-mail. Hidden video cameras have been
installed _ sometimes legally and sometimes not _ in dressing rooms
and public bathrooms. Thieves armed with your Social Security
number can actually hijack your identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing Sacred _ the Politics of Privacy'' is a report
released last month by the Center for Public Integrity, a highly
regarded nonpartisan research organization. The report warned that
the privacy of Americans ``is being compromised and invaded from
many angles'' and asserted that Congress has not done nearly enough
to slow the assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time and again,'' said Charles Lewis, director of the center,
``Congress has put the economic interests of various privacy
invaders ahead of the privacy interests of the American public.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, Congress first heard testimony that
there were problems keeping medical records confidential in 1971.
But it still has not passed legislation designed to curb the
abuses.
</P>
<P>
   So you still get cases like that of Mark Hudson, a former
insurance company employee who told The Times in 1996 that he was
shocked to find during his computer training that he could call up
the records of any of the company's subscribers, including
information about his own psychiatric treatment and the
antidepressant medication he was taking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you unequivocally that patient confidentiality is
not eroding,'' he said. ``It can't erode because it's simply
nonexistent.''
</P>
<P>
   The right to privacy in the workplace is virtually nonexistent
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people assume that federal laws protect Americans from
being spied upon in the workplace,'' said the report. ``To the
contrary, over the years Congress has rejected legislation spelling
out basic privacy protections for employees.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the possible monitoring of telephone
conversations and e-mail, workers are frequently subjected to the
scrutiny of hidden video cameras, can be required to type at
computers that monitor the number of errors they make and the
number of breaks they take, and often are compelled to provide
urine samples and submit to psychological exams.
</P>
<P>
   For some jobs, the scrutiny is reasonable. For others, it is
not. In all cases it should be properly regulated, and the
guidelines should be clear. That is not what is happening. As the
center's report noted, Congress has gone out of its way to preserve
the right of employers to eavesdrop and otherwise spy upon and
collect personal data on their employees.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, privacy advocates have called for legislation that
would spell out and guarantee a citizen's basic right to privacy.
But tremendous amounts of money are being made from the rampant
transfer of the most personal types of information. The huge
corporate interests and others that benefit from that gold mine do
not want it sealed.

SUIT CONTESTS INSURERS' INSISTENCE ON GENERIC CAR PARTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., N.Y., Mass., Pa., Nev., Ill., Ark., Tenn., Hawaii)  (mk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Mark Covington drives his 1992 Chevy Cavalier
at night, the beam of the left headlight wobbles across the road,
and in daylight, the red paint on the hood shows an odd ridge on
the left side.
</P>
<P>
   He blames his insurance company: After his wife crashed the car
into the back of a pickup in April, he said, he took the car to one
of the best body shops in Laurel, Miss., but the shop had to use
generic parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``State Farm just absolutely refused to put GM parts on it,''
Covington said. Instead, the insurance company insisted on
``imitation parts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They said that by using those, it would restore our vehicle to
the original condition and value, which it did not do,'' Covington
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers are seeking to add him to a large class-action suit
against State Farm. But the suit has alarmed consumer advocates,
including Public Citizen, which Ralph Nader founded as part of his
auto-safety crusades, and the attorneys general of New York,
Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Nevada, along with the National
Association of State Insurance Commissioners. They have all filed
briefs at the Supreme Court supporting State Farm and opposing
people like Covington.
</P>
<P>
   The court could announce as early as Monday whether it will hear
arguments in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs say the case involves 5 million drivers and could
cost State Farm $2 billion, but their opponents say it would drive
up insurance rates nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers who filed the class-action suit quote a study done for
General Motors that says that cars repaired with generic parts lose
$1,670 in resale value, and that some generic parts can be
dangerous. Insurance companies dispute both ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides agree that if the class-action suit succeeds, it will
affect nearly all drivers around the country. It could also
overturn insurance regulations or state laws in New York,
Massachusetts and Hawaii, among other places.
</P>
<P>
   According to consumer advocates and the insurance companies,
what State Farm calls ``quality replacement parts,'' and others
call ``after-market parts'' meet the same standards for fit and
finish, corrosion resistance, strength and durability as the ones
produced by GM, Ford or Toyota. The after-market parts have broken
a longstanding monopoly of the auto companies on replacement
fenders, hoods, bumpers and other parts, consumer advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance companies say they have a good reason for
demanding generic replacements. ``They are one of the factors that
contributes to our being able to keep our premiums as low as we
can,'' said David Hurst, a spokesman for State Farm. When an
insured driver has an accident, everyone is better off if
replacement parts cost less, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And manufacturers' parts are expensive. The Alliance of American
Insurers calculated that building a 1996 Chevy Lumina from GM parts
would cost $72,600, more than triple the sticker price of the car.
GM, on the other hand, has advertised that generic parts are not as
durable and can cause safety problems.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute is one of the longest-running in the car business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen two industries more dependent on each other
that hate each other more,'' said Jack Gillis, chief spokesman at
the Consumer Federation of America, referring to insurers and
collision-repair companies. ``There's no respect, no trust, no
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the animosity, he said, comes from repair shops' billing
insurance companies for original manufacturer parts and then using
the cheaper generic ones, a practice that most consumers could not
discern. The body shops sometimes do this to spare car owners the
cost of their deductibles, or sometimes they do it so they can
pocket the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Gillis, who is also the author of an annual buying guide called
The Car Book, is not completely neutral; he is also the executive
director of a nonprofit organization established by the insurance
industry, the Certified Auto Parts Association, to evaluate generic
parts.
</P>
<P>
   Gillis said parts that carried his organization's seal were just
as good as parts from GM and other manufacturers, a contention that
will be an issue in the class-action trial. But he added that only
about 3 percent of the parts used in collision repairs were
certified by his group. Five percent, he said, come from junkyards,
12 percent are noncertified generic parts, and 80 percent come from
auto manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The class-action lawyers, who brought suit in Marion, Ill., in
July 1997, say the use of generic parts constitutes fraud under
Illinois law. ``They breach their contract every time they put
these flimsy, imitation parts on a vehicle,'' said Don Barrett, one
of the class-action lawyers, in Lexington, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   But many consumer advocates disagree. ``All things being equal,
the generic product is going to be cheaper,'' said Brian Wolfman, a
lawyer at Public Citizen, which filed a brief in the case. ``I'm
not suggesting all things are always equal, but sometimes they are
equal. You ought not create barriers to introduction of these
generic products.''
</P>
<P>
   Such products are not only cheaper than the ones made by car
companies, but the competition helps drive down the cost of
car-company parts, too, consumer advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance commissioners and attorneys general see another
issue, which State Farm asked the Supreme Court to review: Should a
court in Illinois be allowed to make what amounts to a national
rule on insurance? (The class includes drivers in all states but
Arkansas and Tennessee, where separate class-action suits have been
filed.)
</P>
<P>
   Insurance regulations in New York encourage the use of generic
parts when equal-quality parts are available; a law in
Massachusetts requires their use. Hawaii, according to documents in
the case, permits the use of manufacturers' parts only if the car
owner pays the difference.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Opponents of generic parts cite safety. In an incident that the
class-action lawyers intend to introduce in the trial, which is
scheduled to begin next April unless the Supreme Court intervenes,
Daniel Della Rova was driving his 1988 Honda Accord on a four-lane
state highway near Reading, Pa., to his job as an electronics
engineer at Lucent Technologies on Jan. 2. He pulled into the left
lane to pass a truck, when his hood slammed into his windshield.
</P>
<P>
   The hood blocked the view to the front completely, he said,
leaving him to navigate by sticking his head out the window.
</P>
<P>
   Della Rova had bought the Honda used. The car's original owner,
Della Rova said, explained that when the Accord was new, he had
accidentally backed into it with his other vehicle, a truck,
puncturing the hood. The first owner repaired the car with a
generic part.
</P>
<P>
   An auto body expert, Charles Barone, who heard about the
accident and later retrieved the Honda from a junkyard, said that
on the after-market hood, the ``striker,'' the piece of metal that
descends and hooks into the latch on the car, was spot-welded
inadequately. One weld showed signs of rust, he said. On Honda
hoods, he said, the striker is a sturdy metal shaft that passes
through several small holes and is then smashed into a mushroom
shape, so it cannot come loose.
</P>
<P>
   Barone, a former body shop owner whom the class-action lawyers
expect to call as a witness, said, ``We all know what junk these
parts are. They are approximations at best.''
</P>
<P>
   Many insurance companies specify generic parts.
</P>
<P>
   At Allstate, the second-largest auto insurer, Raleigh Floyd, a
spokesman, said his company recommended them but would pay for
original manufacturer parts if the policy holder wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole reason for going into generic parts is it reduces
cost, but it also comes down to peace of mind,'' he said. Cars can
be restored to what the industry calls ``pre-loss condition'' with
generic parts, he said, but in the car owner's mind, ``that may
mean the part came out of a Toyota plant.''

 SPORTS COLUMN: SPENCER IS CALLED BETTER THAN McGWIRE, SOSA  
(bl) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the Yankees sent Shane Spencer back to their
Columbus farm team in August for the third time this season, the
26-year-old outfielder was naturally disappointed, but Joe Torre
cheered him up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry, you'll be back,'' the Yankee manager told him.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, Spencer returned. And now, with a splurge of
five homers (including two grand slams) in seven days, this sturdy
crew-cut Californian has apparently slugged his way onto the Yankee
roster for the American League divisional series, which opens
Tuesday night at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is he playing better,'' Torre was asked Friday night, ``than
Strawberry and Raines?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now,'' the manager said, smiling, ``he's playing better
than McGwire and Sosa.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not as farfetched as it might sound. In Spencer's last 19
at-bats before Saturday's game against Tampa Bay, he had 11 hits (2
doubles and 4 singles in addition to the 5 homers) and 15 runs
batted in. In his 59 at-bats, he was hitting .390 with 8 homers and
22 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's amazing,'' Torre said. ``He looks like a high-ball
hitter, but he hits low balls for home runs. He's supposed to be a
fastball hitter, but he hits a changeup for a home run.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Yankees are surprised by Spencer's ability to hit home
runs on pitches he's not supposed to be hitting, imagine the
consternation among the scouts for the other AL playoff teams as
they prepare their charts for their pitching staffs on the Yankee
batters.
</P>
<P>
   For a pitcher, there's nothing worse than not knowing a batter's
supposed weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   What the Yankees don't know yet is whether Shane Spencer is here
to stay or whether he's a late-season sensation whose bat will
eventually develop holes when opposing pitchers learn more about
him. Actually, whether second baseman Chuck Knoblauch's bat will
develop holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Wonderboy broke his bat in Baltimore, he picked up
one of mine,'' Knoblauch said. ``That's what he hit all those
homers with.''
</P>
<P>
   With his first swing in each of four consecutive at-bats,
Spencer hit a grand slam against the Orioles left-hander Jesse
Orosco, a pinch-hit double off the top of the center-field wall
against the Orioles left-hander Jimmy Key, and two home runs
against the Indians right-hander Dave Burba.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four swings and what should have been four homers,'' Knoblauch
said. ``That double was really over the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer added a homer against the Indians' Jason Jacome on
Wednesday, then hit another grand slam against Tampa Bay's Wilson
Alvarez on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuck's bats are the same as mine, 34{ inches and 32 ounces,''
Spencer said. ``I told Chuck I'm going to order my bats through him
from now on.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer first joined the Yankees in April when Chili Davis
needed ankle surgery. He was back in June, then again in July, then
again on Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went 5 for 5 in Kansas City in early August; I used one
of Chili's bats,'' he said. ``I do well with other bats.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite being on the Columbus shuttle, Spencer hit 30 homers in
the International League for the second straight season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shane has worked hard to make himself a major league player,''
Stump Merrill, the Columbus manager who once managed the Yankees,
said from his Maine home. ``He can drive the ball the other way
now. Early in his career he was a hook monster. He hooked
everything. The guys in the third-base dugout weren't safe.''
</P>
<P>
   In spring training with the Yankees in 1997, Spencer misplayed
some fly balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something like that hangs with you,'' Merrill said. ``But he
worked hard on his fielding, chasing down balls in batting practice
every day. I thought we'd lose him in the expansion draft, but we
got lucky. Nobody took him. I think he's got the best bat speed in
the Yankee organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer's success at driving in runs for the Yankees doesn't
surprise Merrill.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's definitely an RBI man,'' Merrill said. ``Some guys fold
when there's runners on base, but his bat is jumping in the bat
rack. He can't wait to get up there.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Shane Spencer will be in a pinstriped uniform Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about next year?'' Joe Torre was asked Friday night.
``Will he be your left fielder next year?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll worry about next week first,'' the Yankee manager said.
``Next year will take care of itself.''

<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Probably the biggest blunder South
Africa made in invading the tiny kingdom of Lesotho on Tuesday was
a military one _ sending fewer than half the soldiers it ultimately
needed. But it is hard to say; the list of blunders is so long.
</P>
<P>
   At week's end, a measure of calm had been returned to Lesotho's
capital, Maseru, and the fighting in the nearby hills appeared
over. But it was clear that what South Africa had planned as a
quick and easy military operation to end political turmoil in
Lesotho had gone terribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 people were dead. Downtown Maseru had been turned
into rubble by looting and burning. And anger against South Africa
was so strong that white foreigners could no longer walk safely in
the streets. Looting had apparently spread to the more remote
regions of this mountainous country; refugees were streaming out,
and there were reports of food shortages.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was there any progress in resolving the political struggles
that had led to the invasion in the first place, raising the
specter of South Africa as a long-term occupying force.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the blunder was being assessed all over South Africa
as opposition parties questioned whether President Nelson Mandela's
government even had the legal right to invade Lesotho _ a country
with breathtaking views and devastating poverty that is entirely
surrounded by South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But there was widespread agreement that a move intended to quell
Lesotho's internal political struggles had instead created
large-scale economic and diplomatic problems that were going to
cost South Africa millions and take years to repair.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought they were being pre-emptive,'' said James Higgs,
director of research for the South Africa-based Institute of
International Affairs, ``moving in before they had a big refugee
problem, an exodus that South Africa would have to deal with. But
what happened was almost the reverse of what they intended to do.
They destroyed the trading community. They now have a long-term
problem, and it is going to be very expensive for South Africa to
repair.''
</P>
<P>
   South African officials said they sent troops to Lesotho early
Tuesday at the invitation of its prime minister, Pakalitha
Mosisili, who said the country was on the verge of a coup. Clearly
Mosisili was not in control of the Lesotho Army. Only a few days
before, the rank and file had forced several senior officers to
step down. And anti-government protesters _ who maintained that
recent elections giving Mosisili's party 79 of 80 Parliament seats
had been rigged _ had clogged the streets of Maseru and brought
government to a standstill.
</P>
<P>
   But military analysts say that South Africa grossly
miscalculated the resistance it would face from Lesotho's 2,000
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was as if they said to themselves: `It's Lesotho. It's a
cakewalk.' '' said Jakkie Cilliers, head of the Johannesburg-based
Institute for Security Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Initially South Africa sent only 600 soldiers in armored
vehicles, ordering them not to use any weapons that would destroy
property. The Lesotho soldiers, hunkered down in their barracks and
hidden in their homes, ambushed the South African force, mostly
with small-arms fire. Though far better equipped, the South
Africans were hampered by the orders not to use their firepower. On
the first day 30 people were reported killed, including nine South
African soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   As the South Africans concentrated on the Lesotho soldiers, the
business district of Maseru was left unguarded. The South Africans
had apparently counted on the Lesotho police, still loyal to the
government, to patrol that area. But instead, having received no
warning of the South African invasion, the police retreated.
</P>
<P>
   Only on Thursday, with help from 200 Botswanan troops, was some
order restored in Maseru. By then little was left standing.
</P>
<P>
   While this is devastating to Lesotho's feeble economy, many of
the businesses are actually South African-owned or built with South
African loans, so that ultimately the bill for rebuilding the
businesses will most likely be paid by South Africans.
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment, South Africans are a deeply hated occupying
force. On Friday they imposed a 6-p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew and began
the difficult process of trying to trace and reclaim weapons that
had been handed out to civilians under siege. They have not managed
to get the government and the opposition to sit down to talks.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts point out that South Africa may also have
seriously damaged its efforts to forge a new image for itself among
its neighbors. In the past, South Africa has often used its
considerable military might to meddle in neighbors' affairs, and
suspicion remains, in part because South Africa's economy and
military abilities dwarf those of most African states.
</P>
<P>
   But Mandela has preached diplomatic solutions since taking
office and is gingerly trying to find a place for the new South
Africa as a member of the Southern African Development Community.
The invasion was conducted under the auspices of this regional
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say, however, that the Lesotho operation will only
give new weight to the idea of South Africa as a regional bully.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly gives a fillip to the view of South African
hegemony.'' said David Welsh, a political analyst at the University
of Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela, for his part, has rejected all criticism of the
invasion, calling it ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter how much criticism we have,'' he said. ``If
we are convinced about what we are doing, that's enough.''

<P>
   LIXIAN, China _ The trucks are still rumbling through the
mountains here, laden with big logs carved from the jagged slopes
of western Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
   But by the end of October, the trucks now crowding these winding
roads will be idle as the timber trade that was the lifeblood of a
vast region of western China, abutting the Tibetan plateau, comes
to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned by this summer's devastating floods along the Yangtze
River, which experts said were intensified because slopes far
upstream had been stripped bare, China has banned cutting of the
old-growth forests that once formed a rich green carpet over these
mountains. No trees were to be cut after Sept. 1, and all logs must
be trucked to timber yards by Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   After a half-century of rampant clear-cutting, China's decision
to save the remaining forests along the upper reaches of the
Yangtze and other major rivers represents a dramatic shift in
priorities in favor of environmental protection. Huge tree-planting
campaigns have also been promised.
</P>
<P>
   But the change is certain to be wrenching for hundreds of
thousands of people in Sichuan, Yunnan and Gansu provinces,
including large numbers of ethnic Tibetans and other minorities,
who have built their lives around the logging trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel this policy will probably benefit future generations,''
said Luo Erwu, who was driving a load of logs out of the mountains
the other day.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this generation will have to suffer,'' added Luo, an
ethnic Tibetan who still owes thousands of dollars on the logging
truck he bought two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Far up a mountain gorge outside Lixian, where trees felled this
summer are still being dragged out, 53-year-old Wang Qunggan brewed
tea over a wood fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be putting down our axes and picking up our spades,''
said Wang, a worried employee of the state-owned logging company
that has cleared much of the surrounding county.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, what Wang has put down is not his ax but a pair of
scissors.
</P>
<P>
   For 27 years, the Western Sichuan Logging Company, which once
had thousands of workers, kept Wang as a full-time barber. Now he
finds himself on hillsides planting seedlings. But at least he
still has a job and a promise of a small pension when he retires in
two years.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone in the region is so lucky. The thousands of former
farmers or workers who scraped together as much as $10,000, a small
fortune here, to buy logging trucks are chief among the casualties.
</P>
<P>
   ``No forest, no money,'' another private trucker, Gu Yuefu, said
with a shrug as he idled in a traffic backup caused by a small
landslide. Since he bought his truck last year for $10,000, Gu has
been able to earn about $300 a month hauling logs from around his
home of Aba, in the far western mountains of Sichuan, down to
Chengdu, the provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is deep in debt: no one wants to buy a logging truck and
he does not know what he will do. ``Maybe I'll just sit around
drinking tea,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other truckers and timber workers who expect to lose their jobs
said they would have to return to farming. In this densely
populated, land-short region this may only worsen another serious
cause of erosion and silting of rivers: the widespread farming of
steep mountain slopes.
</P>
<P>
   Abrupt as it seemed this fall, the logging ban was only a bow to
the inevitable, a hastened end to a classic pattern of boom and
bust.
</P>
<P>
   At midcentury, about 20 percent of the land in the mountainous
western parts of Sichuan, Yunnan and Gansu was covered with dense,
primary forest, said Shen Guofang, a professor at the Beijing
Forestry University, in a recent interview. Now, between logging
and the spread of farming, the share of land in forest has been
reduced to 10 percent, he said, and much of that consists of slowly
recovering second-growth or plantations that do less to conserve
soil and water.
</P>
<P>
   Peng Huangshi, deputy director of forestry for Sichuan, said
that ``the timber resources have been approaching complete
exhaustion'' in the province, with marketable trees increasingly
inaccessible. Many logging concerns have been running in the red,
with the government forced to make up the losses.
</P>
<P>
   About two years ago, concerned about the financial and
ecological costs, national and provincial officials drew up plans
to phase out most logging in Sichuan and restore the landscape,
Shen and provincial officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, national planning officials said there was not
enough money to proceed, Shen said. Money would be needed to
support displaced forest workers and pay retirees, to subsidize
local governments dependent on logging revenues and to pay for
tree-planting and other new projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flooding this year pushed the government at last to
implement this plan,'' Shen said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the logging has been by large state-owned companies,
although towns and even private farmers have increasingly been
involved, sometimes logging illegally in protected zones.
</P>
<P>
   With accessible timber increasingly scarce, the more than 20
large, state-owned companies in the region were on a financial
treadmill, with mounting losses. Not only were costs rising while
production fell, but the older companies were saddled with the
pension and health costs of workers from the glory days.
</P>
<P>
   The large state logging companies in Sichuan alone now have
45,000 active employees, but are responsible for the pensions of
65,000 retirees, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Western Sichuan company, where Wang, the former barber,
works, is a case in point. In the mid-1960s, it was producing
1,560,000 cubic feet of wood each year and had a few thousand
workers. Last year, it was able to cut only 106,000 cubic feet. By
the time of this month's ban, its staff was down to 462 _ including
many working in reforestation or hydropower projects rather than
logging _ and the company must support 2,353 retirees.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the company has been losing money for 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   Wang recalled conditions when he started working here in 1971,
when big trees were plentiful and near. ``Back then, when we'd have
a meeting, they'd have all sorts of food laid out for us,'' he
said. ``We were receiving bonuses all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Several workers for the company said it often falls behind in
paying their wages, which for many are only $36 a month. Some said
they had not been paid since June.
</P>
<P>
   To aid the transition from a logging economy, the central
government has promised Sichuan $121 million a year in aid,
provincial officials said, while the province will come up with an
extra $24 million to help its western region.
</P>
<P>
   Productively employing all 45,000 state forestry workers in
Sichuan will itself be a challenge. Shen said that reforestation
requires only one-third the work force of logging. Local officials
also dream of promoting eco-tourism in the remaining pristine
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Forestry officials in Beijing say that nationwide _ logging is
also being curbed in China's northeast and in the upper reaches of
the Yellow River _ at least 241,000 state timber workers will be
laid off.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands more affected people, not officially state
workers, have not been promised government aid. Many were hired by
the state companies as ``temporary'' employees, with no benefits.
Thousands more in township-run companies or in private enterprise,
like the dismayed truckers on the road, depended on logging for
their livings.
</P>
<P>
   Small businesses in towns along the roads, too, will feel the
pinch. As he patched a threadbare tire in a grungy storefront here
in Lixian, a man who gave his name as Li said that 80 percent of
his work involved repairing logging-truck tires. ``Our income will
fall for sure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the sudden, blanket ban on felling primary forest
might be unnecessarily traumatic, Shen, the forestry professor,
said: ``Given Chinese reality, there are just too many people
involved, and if you tried a gradual approach you couldn't stop the
logging. So it must be done very clearly and strictly this way.''.
</P>
<P>
   After one or two years, he said, officials can consider whether
to allow selective, less-damaging logging methods in some areas.
And some wood production from second-growth forests and older
plantations will continue.
</P>
<P>
   Sichuan officials are putting a brave face on the situation,
perhaps because they accept that the era of easy timber money was
already gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that whatever problems the logging ban creates can
be overcome,'' said Zhang Zhongwei, the deputy governor of Sichuan,
in an interview. ``It's for the good of future generations.''

AFGHANISTAN'S OPIUM BUSINESS HURT BY BAD WEATHER, BORDER TENSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Repeating for all needing.)  (bl) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bad weather and tensions with neighboring Iran have slashed the
opium production of Afghanistan and hampered its opium exports for
European heroin markets, according to a new United Nations survey.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Drug Control Program estimated last year that
Afghanistan had become the world's largest producer of opium,
surpassing Myanmar. The opium is refined into heroin and morphine
en route to Europe and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But heavy rains, hailstorms and earthquakes this year have wiped
out one-quarter of the expected opium crop in Afghanistan, said
Pino Arlacchi, the program's executive director. Arlacchi said in
an interview that the Afghan poppy harvest this year was expected
to produce 2,300 tons of raw opium, compared with 3,100 tons last
year. He said the crop failure in central and southern Afghanistan,
including the poppy-rich provinces of Kandahar and Helmand, had
been reported by Afghan surveyors for the U.N. program, who travel
from village to village to interview officials and poppy farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The rugged and remote terrain of Afghanistan, its history of
lawlessness and chaotic warfare and the absence of a central
government helped opium flourish in recent years while the militant
Islamic movement called the Taliban seized most of the country.
</P>
<P>
   When Arlacchi visited Afghanistan last November, Taliban leaders
promised to wipe out opium poppy production, even making a show of
burning two tons of opium in June. They also promised to eliminate
new planting in return for development aid from the United Nations,
which operates a $14 million-a-year drug-control program in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   But the latest survey, Arlacchi said, showed that poppy
cultivation had increased more than 9 percent since last year and
had spread to two eastern provinces, Lowgar and Laghman, where it
had not been reported earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The religious leader of the Taliban would cooperate with us,''
Arlacchi said. ``But the movement is too fragmented to act.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States estimates that Afghanistan produced 1,400 tons
of opium last year, a smaller figure based on satellite photos but
not ground-level research. Its estimate this year has not yet been
made public.
</P>
<P>
   World production of opium may total 5,000 to 5,500 tons in 1998,
according to U.N. estimates. Based on a 10-to-1 ratio for refining,
the Afghan shortfall of 770 tons of opium means a potential loss of
77 tons of heroin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a result that cannot be attributed to a strong anti-drug
action by the Taliban,'' Arlacchi said. If the Taliban are not more
helpful, he added, he will ask the United States and other
countries that are financing a development program to use that
money to block drug exports.
</P>
<P>
   The deployment of tens of thousands of Iranian troops along the
western border of Afghanistan this month in response to the killing
of a group of Iranian diplomats by Taliban fighters has also cut
established smuggling routes to heroin refineries in eastern
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the price of raw opium on the Iranian-Afghan border
has soared to $50 to $77 a pound, up from $18 to $32 a pound last
year, Arlacchi said.
</P>
<P>
   The disruption of smuggling routes to the west has led
traffickers to find circuitous routes north through Tajikistan and
south through Pakistan to the Arabian Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Arlacchi said he did not expect the European price of
Afghan-derived heroin to rise significantly because a year's supply
is stockpiled along the smuggling corridor through Turkey and the
Balkans.

SPORTS COLUMN: PAYTON SHOWS HIS HUMAN SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``Be nice to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Those were the first words from Jay Payton, a rookie who made a
base-running mistake on the last Friday night of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He put me in to run; I messed it up,'' Payton patiently told
the phalanx of reporters who clumped over to his locker after the
New York Mets had squandered another chance, 6-5, to the Atlanta
Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying the potential tying run in the eighth inning, Payton
tried to run on Andruw Jones, merely one of the highest-caliber
arms in baseball, and was out from here to Chattahoochee.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the Mets would be locked in a bizarre triple tie with the
Chicago Cubs and San Francisco Giants going into the last Saturday
of this compelling season. Ten teams in two leagues prepared for
playoffs without any secure knowledge of where or whom they would
be playing.
</P>
<P>
   On this same last weekend, Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire were
matching home runs as the entire nation seemed to root for these
two gallant sluggers to finish tied.
</P>
<P>
   But these thrilling final days were not only about the
superstars, Sosa and McGwire. The final weekend also belonged to
the role players, the fringe veterans and the rookies who, in a
month of expanded rosters, were suddenly thrust into games that
meant everything.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is the only sport with glory and ignominy etched on
scorecards, isolated for eternity. One botched play can stick with
a man forever. For the image of a runner forever a second late and
a yard slow, Cal Abrams of Brooklyn was gunned down at home by
Richie Ashburn of the Phillies on the last day of the 1950 season.
For September-October blunders, we have Bill Buckner's bobble, Fred
Merkel's base-running gaffe, Leon Durham's fumble, Mickey Owens'
passed ball.
</P>
<P>
   In the glaring sun of Milwaukee on Wednesday, an outfielder
named Brant Brown muffed a fly ball that cost the Cubs a game on
what should have been the very last play. Other major leaguers
shuddered when they saw the kid trudge off the field, wondering if
he had given the Cubs yet another season to despair.
</P>
<P>
   Brant Brown even flashed through Jay Payton's mind Friday, after
Payton had been gunned down at third base. Nothing disrespectful
toward Brown, but Payton knew he was not quite in that category.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' Payton would say later, quite kindly. ``If I
stay at second, you can't predict what would have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Mike Piazza was the next batter, and he had merely
drilled two line drives so powerful that they bounced past
outfielders on the grass for doubles instead of singles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rule No. 1 is, you don't make the third out at third base,''
said the Mets' manager, Bobby Valentine, making it clear that Rule
No. 2 is, you don't make the third out when your cleanup hitter is
up next.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Payton knows this. He was a baseball all-American and an
academic all-American not just anywhere but at Georgia Tech, the
esteemed university right up the road from Turner Field. He helped
the Yellow Jackets into the final game of the College World Series
in 1994, and was a teammate of the noted Boston shortstop Nomar
Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   While Garciaparra flourished, Payton needed two reconstructive
surgeries on his right elbow, missing the entire 1997 season,
finally making the majors for a few games this season. He's still
only 25 and the best hitting prospect in the Mets' organization;
and he can run.
</P>
<P>
   Payton was on the bench Friday when Tony Phillips walked, moving
a pinch-runner to second base. With his bench jammed with players,
Valentine went for youth and speed, sending in Payton for the
38-year-old Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   Was this move necessary? Was it the compulsive act of a manager
who has never reached the playoffs, or a no-brainer move to get
younger legs on the bases? Would Phillips have run on Andruw Jones?
Should somebody have cautioned Payton against running on Jones?
</P>
<P>
   Before there was time to ponder such issues, John Olerud whacked
a single, and the runners took off. Mike Kinkade was going to be
safe at home, and Payton was not expected to glance at the
third-base coach because the play was in front of him, out in
center field.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Andruw Jones,'' Payton said later. ``I know he's got a
great arm. It was just an error in judgment. When I saw the ball
off the bat, I thought I could reach third. I got halfway to third
and I should have stopped and gone back to second. I made the third
out at third base _ and that's a no-no.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of ballplayers today who will blow off an
interview after going 3 for 4. Here was a poised college man up
from Class AAA ball, and he could handle the mob around his locker.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's not the end of the world,'' Jay Payton said.
``Not after all I've been through. I've had those surgeries on my
elbow. I learned from that. I'll learn from this. I feel I can
handle any situation. I'm hopeful I get in the same situation
again.''
</P>
<P>
   He already knows something important. You don't have to
surrender your good manners just because you were a few feet short
on the last weekend of a baseball race.

in Mexico City's Plaza of the Three Cultures for a rally. As dusk
approached, bullets suddenly began to rain on the square, an
ancient pre-Colombian site also called Tlatelolco. ``Nacha,'' as
she was nicknamed, fled for her life as dozens, hundreds or even
thousands _nobody really knows _ were cut down by military bullets.
Within a couple of months, Nacha was detained and, along with other
students, sentenced to 16 years in prison on trumped up charges of
sedition and homicide. She served two years, part of a shocking
experience that scarred a generation and tarnished Mexico's
reputation around the world. Of all the student movements of1968,
Mexico's was perhaps the most violently repressed. Thirty years
later, Mexicans are preparing to commemorate this event, which
still remains shrouded in government secrecy. (Ferriss, Cox News

   THE CLINTON CRISIS
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-AUTHORITY _ WASHINGTON _ The year was 1863, the nation
was torn by civil war and the president was struggling against
virulent forces ready to abandon the fight against a rebellion that
had split the country in two. With just 272 well-chosen words,
however, Abraham Lincoln rallied a weary people around the cause of
union and refined the purpose of their very nationhood, in what may
be the single greatest use in American history of the sheer weight
of one man's character and the authority of the office he holds. A
hundred and thirty five years after Lincoln's Gettysburg Address,
the nation is at odds once more, divided this time by the leader
himself, who's own moral authority is at the center of a battle
raging in Congress and the American public at large over whether
Bill Clinton is fit to serve. How important is moral authority to
the American presidency, where does it come from and how might
Clinton regain it if he remains in office? (Deans, Cox News Service

   GINGRICH _ President Clinton is not the only politician caught
in the impeachment cross-hairs. So is the Speaker. On one hand,
Gingrich must try to make the process appear as non-partisan as
possible if Republicans are to avoid any backlash. On the other
hand, he cannot appear too soft nor can he afford not to hold
hearings, given the unrest in the right wing of his own party and
his upcoming election for Speaker. It's a slippery path and one
that seems to lead almost inevitably to impeachment hearings.

   LEGALESE _ As the intricate details of the war of words between
President Clinton and independent counsel Kenneth Starr have come
into public view, many Americans are scoffing at legal distinctions
they see as just more doublespeak from Spin City lawyers. But in
many ways, attorneys and experts say, the case reveals how lawyers,
defendants and witnesses proceed linguistically in court every day.
``When people say it's legal mumbo-jumbo, this is important legal
mumbo-jumbo,'' said Atlanta attorney Craig Gillen, who was a
prosecutor in the Iran-Contra investigation. ``Words mean
everything. Words are exceedingly important.'' (Croft, Atlanta

   DAYTONA _ DAYTONA BEACH, Fla._ After Labor Day and the end of
the summer high season, Laura Pittman is accustomed to business
slowing down at the gift shop where she works. But this year's
slow-down comes after a summer in which Florida's wildfire crisis
devastated the normally busy June-July period. Even after the fires
were put out, many visitors stayed away, thinking the area was in
charred ruins, business owners say. Tourism officials hope to
recoup some of the losses with several big events this fall, but
business owners fear it will be too little too late. ``October will
be better than normal, but it can't replace July,'' said Patrick
Welsh, owner of the 10-room Beach House Motel, who suffered a 50

participation and remind them of safety tips because agents will
also be in the woods. Bearhunters use tracking dogs, and it's

</P>
<P>
   Companies like Lockheed Martin IMS, an arm of the aerospace
giant, are tapping into millions of dollars that went to public
agencies prior to welfare reform. The opportunity is a direct
result of the historic legislation passed by Congress in 1996. U.S.
lawmakers figured the private sector could move people from welfare
to work faster and cheaper. Under the new law, states now have the
authority to issue contracts with private companies for welfare
services. (Cooper, Palm Beach Post).

   WELFARE _ Florida's welfare recipients are costing taxpayers
33.5 percent more than two years ago, when welfare reform began,
according to federal figures. This comes when welfare rolls are
dropping in record numbers. In Florida, the welfare population has
dropped some 52 percent. However _ instead of giving a break to
taxpayers _ states are using the savings to pay for programs that
either get recipients ready for job or keep them employed. The
increase of federal and state money into welfare will continue
until the year 2002, according to congressional estimates. That's
when Florida's federal block grant is slated to make its first
decline, federal figures show. (Cooper, Palm Beach Post).

REPORT CRITICIZES HOTEL UNION FOR ITS FINANCIAL PRACTICES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill., Nev., Wis.)  (js) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A court-appointed monitor has found widespread financial
wrongdoing in the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union, a
group that has long been linked to organized crime, attacking its
former president in particular for using union money for personal
activities, such as flying his wife to Palm Springs, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The monitor, Kurt Muellenberg, issued a stinging report late
Friday that repeatedly faulted the former president, Edward Hanley
Sr., who recently resigned. The report noted that Hanley had put
relatives on the union payroll and had the union lease a luxury
apartment for him that he rarely used.
</P>
<P>
   Muellenberg described a union that was out of control, lacking
financial controls and dominated by a man who milked the union
treasury to finance a lavish lifestyle and reward his friends.
</P>
<P>
   Muellenberg, who was appointed to root out wrongdoing and
organized crime links from the union, forced Hanley to resign on
July 31. Although Muellenberg charged more than a dozen lesser
officials with links to organized crime, he did not accuse Hanley
or other top former or current officers with such ties.
</P>
<P>
   Hanley has repeatedly insisted that he has done nothing wrong
and that he retired voluntarily. But Muellenberg pressured Hanley
to step down after accusing him of using the union's airplane for
personal travel and of having the union lease a Cadillac Allante, a
two-seat convertible, and other luxury cars at inflated rates to
enable him to buy the cars at a heavy discount when the leases
ended. Muellenberg said he agreed to drop his charges against
Hanley in exchange for the union official's agreement to retire and
to pay back $13,944 relating to his purchase of leased vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The monitor also accused Hanley of having a $31,000 no-show job
at the union's Chicago local, which was run by his son. He was also
charged with giving a friend a $48,250-a-year job at a fraudulent
local he set up in Wisconsin, near his vacation home.
</P>
<P>
   Muellenberg, former head of the Justice Department's Organized
Crime Strike Force, wrote, ``The thousands of hard-working men and
women members of this union deserve better leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   The report comes at an awkward time, embarrassing the
244,000-member union just as the president who succeeded Hanley
vowed a new and cleaner chapter in the union's history.
</P>
<P>
   The new president, John Wilhelm, who has a reputation as one of
the nation's most successful union organizers, faulted the report
for focusing on the negative. He said the report wrongly ignored
the union's leadership in organizing thousands of workers in Las
Vegas, and elsewhere and in developing innovative organizing
tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important to remember that this monitorship was
always about organized crime,'' Wilhelm said Friday night. ``The
report verifies that with respect to former president Hanley, the
former general officers and the current general officers, there is
no organized crime problem. The principal reason we entered into
this was to put that allegation, which has dogged us for decades,
behind us. It's fundamentally important for the future of this
union that this is behind us.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The hotel workers union, along with the teamsters, longshoremen
and laborers, has been considered one of the four unions most
closely tied to organized crime. Muellenberg was appointed monitor
in 1995 as part of a consent decree the hotel employees signed to
settle a federal racketeering lawsuit accusing the union of being
influenced by mob figures.
</P>
<P>
   Muellenberg's report contained a cavalcade of criticisms. He
found that only one of the union's five auditors had a degree in
accounting. He said it was wrong for the union to provide leased
cars to consultants, especially when he found no paperwork showing
what work the consultants had performed.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested it was unwise for Hanley to live near Chicago and
spend just 25 days a year in Washington, at the union's
headquarters. He criticized the union's paying for offices and
staff in Chicago and Palm Springs, where Hanley had a vacation
home.
</P>
<P>
   Muellenberg called on the union to set up stricter policies for
auditing and for providing leased cars and union credit cards. He
recommended that the union's president live in Washington and that
the union eliminate its Palm Springs office. He said the union
should sell its airplane _ something it did the day Hanley stepped
down.
</P>
<P>
   Wilhelm said the union's misspending was prevalent in businesses
and other institutions in society. ``Taken as a whole, my response
and that of the executive board is rather than quibble,'' he said,
``we support all of the recommendations, and we will implement
every one of them.''

7 NATIONS TO CREATE PEACEKEEPING FORCE IN BALKANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ Seven southeastern European countries agreed
Saturday to create a multinational military force that could be
used for peacekeeping or aid operations in the Balkans and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Three NATO allies _ Italy, Greece and Turkey _ joined Albania,
Bulgaria, Macedonia and Romania in creating the force, which will
be a brigade with 3,000 to 4,000 troops divided into 14 companies
by the time it is ready, probably sometime next year.
</P>
<P>
   The countries' defense ministers signed a pact creating the
force after meeting here in the Macedonian capital. The United
States has welcomed the force, not so much for its military
significance as for the cooperation between countries that have a
history of rivalries and tensions.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen, who attended the meeting
Saturday, said the agreement underscored ``new cooperation and
confidence in southeastern Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still people in the region who would rather dig new
graves than bury old hatreds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The seven countries, along with the United States and Slovenia,
are part of what is called the Southeastern European Defense
Ministerial. Cohen's predecessor, William Perry, launched the
cooperative forum as a way to forge closer ties between the
militaries of each of the countries and promote stability in the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia's minister of defense, Lazar Kitanovski, called the
force ``our contribution to the strengthening of European order.''
He warned that despite efforts to improve military contacts between
nations, the region remained riven by ``ethnic intolerance'' and
``religious fundamentalism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though there is progress in the cooperation in the
region,'' he said, ``there are still risks that pose a threat not
only to certain countries _ they pose a threat to security in
broader proportions.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting Saturday _ the third between the defense ministers
since 1996 _ comes at a time of rising tension caused by a Yugoslav
crackdown in Kosovo, whose population is predominately ethnic
Albanian. Albania and Macedonia fear the fighting could spill into
their countries; some refugees already have.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its efforts to press the Yugoslav president, Slobodan
Milosevic, to ease the crackdown, NATO dispatched more than 80
airplanes to Albania in June. It has also staged training exercises
in NATO's ``Partnership for Peace'' countries _ central and eastern
European countries waiting to join the Alliance which include the
four Balkan states that signed the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations maintains a small peacekeeping force in
Macedonia, a former Yugoslav republic that declared its
independence in 1991. The force, which now has about 700 troops,
monitors Macedonia's border with Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav
republic, and Albania.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the U.N. Security Council renewed the mission and, in a
sign of the growing fears of the spread of fighting or refugees
from Kosovo, increased the number of troops to 1,050. The United
States has contributed about 350 troops since the mission began;
American officials said that would not increase.
</P>
<P>
   The new Southeastern European Defense Ministerial, first
proposed a year and a half ago, is not intended to be a subset of
NATO. The force formed Saturday can train together and, if called,
deploy together. The countries still must work out some operational
details, including where to put the force's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The United States will not contribute troops, but Cohen pledged
to provide expertise and equipment. The Pentagon has long supported
the creation of peacekeeping forces that, like this one, forge
closer relations between militaries. Officials often point to the
Baltic Bridge, a peacekeeping force with troops from Lithuania,
Latvia and Estonia.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the agreement Saturday, there were indications of
tensions that still must be overcome. The document the ministers
signed left off the names of the seven countries because of a
dispute over Macedonia's name. Greece has refused to recognize the
name Republic of Macedonia, insisting that the country be referred
to as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.

ASSISTANT COACHES SEEK BETTER TREATMENT FROM NFL OWNERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just over a year ago, officials from the National Football
League Coaches Association, angry at what they thought was unfair
treatment by the owners, met with Jeffrey Kessler, perhaps the most
renowned sports antitrust lawyer in the country, in a hotel
ballroom in Indianapolis. The topic of conversation? The NFL
assistant coaches were considering suing the league for antitrust
violations.
</P>
<P>
   One of the assistant's biggest complaints has been that since
the NFL office keeps track of the salaries of almost every coach,
and individual teams can find out approximately what those salaries
are, there is almost a built-in salary ceiling. Some coaches wanted
to sue to remove those restraints, members of the coaches
association said last week. The NFL says it in no way violates
antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the idea fizzled because the assistants were worried
that a lawsuit would hurt their careers. Also, it would have taken
a large six-figure retainer just to hire Kessler, and the lawsuit
itself would have cost $3 million. Kessler said he had spoken with
assistant coaches in the association, but he had no further
comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still came very close to filing the suit,'' said a member
of the group who requested anonymity. ``That's how angry we were. A
lot of coaches are still very angry.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Larry Kennan, the respected longtime assistant coach, has
become the director of the association, and the coaches are taking
a less confrontational approach, choosing instead to negotiate
quietly with the league. Still, some of the more than 400 assistant
coaches remain bitter, since they think they are the only group in
the league that has yet to receive its fair share.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are interested in is respect and little dignity,''
said Kennan, the executive director of the association who has
coached in pro football for 15 years. ``You get hired, fired,
kicked around, and some of it is just not right.''
</P>
<P>
   Head coaches sign contracts that can make them rich for life,
even if they are fired. Assistant coaches are more vulnerable. They
work 80 hours a week, 26 consecutive weeks with no days off, but
that does not keep them from being fired, on average, every two to
three years, according to Kennan. One coach said he has moved so
much in such a short time that his son missed learning cursive
handwriting in school.
</P>
<P>
   The association recently submitted a proposal to the league that
Kennan said would improve the quality of life for assistant
coaches. He expects a counterproposal from the league by the end of
the year. What the coaches are looking for includes:
</P>
<P>
   _ A lowering of the retirement age. The league pays a full
pension at age 65, but only 9 of the 405 assistants, or 2.2
percent, are at least that age, according to the league. Some
assistants feel there is age discrimination, something the league
denies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Increased health-care benefits and the establishment of
severance pay.
</P>
<P>
   _ Standard medical and dental insurance. Kennan said the
policies vary from team to team. Some policies are great, he said;
others are terrible.
</P>
<P>
   _ Real-estate expenses. Since coaches move so much, they
sometimes incur massive losses in moving and real-estate fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Player salaries have gone up dramatically,'' Kennan said.
``Head coaches as well. The officials have great benefits that we
don't have and they're part-time employees. So it's kind of our
turn to get what we deserve. We haven't asked for anything
extravagant.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL says assistant coaches are paid well and they have more
jobs than ever before. In 1988, according to the league, there were
291 assistant coaches making between $86,000 and $175,000. Now
there are 405 assistants making between $148,381 and $475,000.
</P>
<P>
   The league also says it has greatly increased health benefits
for coaches by, among other things, making it mandatory for a team
to continue a fired coach's benefits for 90 days at the old team's
expense.
</P>
<P>
   Kennan said negotiations with the league have been
``gentlemanly.'' Things between the league and assistant coaches
have not always been that way, however. In May, 50 assistant
coaches walked into a league-sponsored coaching symposium 15
minutes late as a protest. Then the coaches association this month
joined forces with the NFL Players Association, which one owner
called a hostile act.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there are some coaches who would like to take a more
militant approach. They want to wear black arm bands at a game to
show solidarity, or turn in game plans one day late across the
league, or have a one-day strike at training camp next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe things will ever get to that point,'' said
Kennan.

   RAVENS' WOODSON APPEALS
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore Ravens defensive back Rod Woodson refused to take a
drug test last month because he was irritated at having to take a
test only several days earlier. After cooling down, he eventually
took the second test, but it was too late. His original refusal was
an automatic violation of the NFL's drug policy, and Woodson was
automatically entered into the substance-abuse program.
</P>
<P>
   Woodson, one of the best defensive backs ever and a member of
the league's 75th anniversary team, is appealing the decision and
will meet with Commissioner Paul Tagliabue soon. If the decision is
reversed by Tagliabue, Woodson would be taken out of the drug
program. If it is not, Woodson will only remain in the program for
a short time since no one in the NFL believes Woodson has a drug
problem.
</P>
<P>
   PARCELLS' SHOTGUN OFFENSE
</P>
<P>
   What helped push the New York Jets past the Indianapolis Colts
last week was the relentless verbal battering by coach Bill
Parcells of his players as he threatened many of their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Parcells said his actions were exaggerated by the
news media. Not so say the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach dished out some threats during the course of the week,''
said linebacker Pepper Johnson. ``I know it definitely helped my
play when he personally threatened me. I don't know if the threat
is meant to be in the press but it's one of those things where guys
didn't want to be looking at 0-3, it's like looking down the barrel
of a shotgun.''

SPORTS COLUMN: FOR GIANTS, `THE BEST OFFENSE' IS A MATTER OF
PERSPECTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ So I am watching the New York Giants play the Dallas
Cowboys last Monday night, trailing by 10 points deep into the
third quarter, and I am thinking, no doubt about it, they are about
to score a touchdown any second now, put themselves right back in
the football game.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that I am only thinking this when Dallas has the
ball, not the Giants. When Danny Kanell is throwing short on
third-and-long, I am saying, hurry up, don't waste more time by
moving the chains. Get the defense back on the field in good
scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   This, I agree, is somewhat extremist, and no way to instill
confidence in a young quarterback, much less get to a Super Bowl.
Yet I wonder if that's what goes through the minds of a few Giants'
defenders sometimes when they stand there on the sideline watching
their offense do well to avoid going backwards.
</P>
<P>
   After three games in a 1-2 season, with a date here Sunday with
a San Diego team whose rookie quarterback last week completed one
whole pass for 4 incremental yards, the Giants' defense would seem
to have a good chance to redeem itself for failing to reach the end
zone last week. A victory over the San Diego Chargers would not
prove much, only buy Giants head coach Jim Fassel time to somehow
pump heat into an offense that has not even been as tepid as it was
last year. It would help Kanell to have a running game that
measures more than three yards a carry. But sooner than later, this
notion that the Giants can actually go somewhere with their defense
as their offense, with Kanell merely ``managing the game,'' will
have to be junked.
</P>
<P>
   We have all heard the maxim that defense wins championships but,
let's face it, if the Knicks have taught us anything during the
course of the 1990s, it is that defense mostly manhandles
mediocrity. The offensive geniuses, the Michael Jordans and Brett
Favres, ultimately figure out the best defensive schemes, so here
is a better expression, albeit one a bit tortured, relating to a
Giants team that must play Denver, Green Bay, San Francisco and
Kansas City later this season:
</P>
<P>
   The best offense is not a good defense, but I guess it is better
than no offense at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big plays, that's our mentality,'' said John Fox, the Giants'
popular defensive coordinator, refusing to accept that his defense
can't replicate the roll it went on last season, when it habitually
handed the offense the ball in field position to die for. ``We're
going to get better. We're going to get turnovers. I can't tell you
how many, but we'll get our share.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a tough job, carrying the Giants' offense, but somebody has
to do it Sunday before this defending Eastern Division champion
falls to 1-3 with another road game at Tampa Bay next, and with
everyone well aware that the schedule will not be serving up a
steady diet of New Orleans and Alcorn State.
</P>
<P>
   With all due respect for Fox and what his defense did to carry
the Giants to 10-5-1 last season, if the Giants don't start moving
the ball, the franchise's supposed turnaround will be revealed as
the product of last season's generous schedule. Conditions change,
year-to-year, in addition to the quality of a playoff team's
opponents. Injuries like the one that took right cornerback Jason
Sehorn obviously change the physical equation, and expectations
based on previous success may very well subtly alter defensive
psychology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we've been freelancing to try to force
turnovers,'' Fox argued. ``I just think we're young, we have some
new kids and we haven't caught up yet. And what happened against
Dallas is that they had a game plan where they weren't going to
throw the ball, except on third down. They used a lot of short
yardage groups, multiple tight ends, to limit the number of ways we
could take it away. As coaches, we weren't ready for that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, well, it's true, teams are getting smarter against us,''
said Jessie Armstead, the big-play linebacker whose nagging ankle
injury hasn't helped either. ``We want to make big plays, we know
we have to make big plays. We just have to keep coming, keep
coming, and hope that sooner or later, they'll slip up and we'll
capitalize on a key mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, that sounds like a fair enough game plan for young Ryan
Leaf on Sunday but Elway and Young and Favre and a few others who
aren't going to disintegrate are out there this time around. The
Giants were a whole lot of fun last season when their defense was
so dominant that it became their offense.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to do that two years in a row, for the variety
of reasons already mentioned, and by the end of October, if the
Giants have not developed a real offense, their season will become
one long funeral procession that stalls on fourth down and punts.

HARRY CARAY HELPS BASEBALL TO A HEAVENLY YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- We've heard the stories of lifeless flowers
blooming anew in a family garden the spring after a loved one's
death. Now comes even more persuasive proof that there is an
afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   The rejuvenation of baseball in 1998 can't be explained any
other way than to say Harry Caray, God rest his irascible soul,
made it to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   For 16 years he was the Chicago Cubs' MVP, never mind that he
held a microphone and not a bat. He could belt out words as
impressively as Cubs outfielder Sammy Sosa -- or as Caray would
say, Thammy Thotha -- has belted out baseballs this year.
</P>
<P>
   Caray loved baseball, beer and (pardon the expression) broads.
</P>
<P>
   He observed games for a living but was a passionate participant
in life. So it figures that after succumbing to a heart attack,
he'd try to find some way to let the few detractors he left behind
know he had landed on his feet, up in the clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Holy cow, you'd have to be wearing glasses thicker than Caray's
black-rimmed numbers not to see the clues he has been scattering
about the country during the past six months.
</P>
<P>
   From the New York Yankees' season-long tear to the historic
home-run duel being waged by Sosa and St. Louis slugger Mark
McGwire to Cal Ripken Jr.'s astonishing decision to take a seat, it
has been a baseball season tailor-made for the fans that Caray
called the unsung heroes of the game.
</P>
<P>
   His love for the game is being perpetuated by die-hard
enthusiasts and dilettantes alike. After whiffing badly in 1994
when a strike led to the cancellation of the World Series, baseball
is soaring to heights heretofore reserved for one of McGwire's
blasts.
</P>
<P>
   Sports Illustrated, long a barometer of which way the sporting
winds are blowing, has devoted nine of its 21 covers since the
start of May to baseball -- three of four this month. In the same
five-month span last year, the weekly magazine slapped baseball on
its cover four times and not at all in September, when the regular
season is winding down and interest figures to be peaking.
</P>
<P>
   A phone survey conducted by CBS and The New York Times found
baseball is more popular than at any time since the news
organizations started polling people on the subject in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-three percent said they were at least somewhat interested
in baseball, up from 42 percent a year ago. Twenty-two percent of
the 960 adults surveyed described themselves as very interested in
following Major League Baseball, up from 14 percent five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the thinning of pitching talent due to expansion and
the squeeze plays so many franchises are trying in an effort to get
ever more luxurious and lucrative digs, more people than ever
(roughly 71 million) will have attended a game by today's
regular-season end.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not counting the crazies who have stood outside
Chicago's Wrigley Field, hoping to catch a piece of history
launched by Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   Lest anybody doubt that Caray is orchestrating this season the
way he used to the seventh-inning stretch, the proof is in Sosa's
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Before this year, Sosa never had hit more than 40 home runs in
any season. He went into the final weekend with 66, five more than
Roger Maris' previous single-season record. That tied him with
McGwire, who averaged 55 homers in 1996 and 1997, and who plays for
the Cubs' fiercest rival -- and Caray's first major-league
employer.
</P>
<P>
   Caray announced St. Louis Cardinals games from 1945 to 1969. We
imagine he's pleased as spiked punch to see Sosa and McGwire going
down to the wire, (ITAL)mano a mano(END ITAL) for bragging rights
to a chunk of 37-year-old history.
</P>
<P>
   We can picture him yelling himself hoarse in heaven: ``There it
goes . . . it might be outta here . . . it could be . . . It is! A
home run! Holy cow!''
</P>
<P>
   Boy, oh boy, as Caray would say. In this season to savor, there
has been something for every sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   The game's purists could revel in Yankees pitcher David Wells'
perfect game against the Minnesota Twins in May at the House That
Ruth Built.
</P>
<P>
   There also was Cubs rookie pitcher Kerry Wood fanning his age
against one of the more explosive lineups, striking out 20 Houston
Astros. (Can there be any doubt Caray was behind all of Kerry's
K's, as well as his 13-6 campaign?)
</P>
<P>
   The 13th perfect game in history. Thirteen wins for a rookie.
That Caray -- it's good to see his puckish sense of humor survived
his flight to the afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   For the game's historians, Caray delivered San Francisco's Barry
Bonds, who distinguished himself as the first player to record 400
home runs and 400 steals; Houston's Craig Biggio, who became only
the second player to steal 50 bases and hit 50 doubles in the same
year; Texas' Juan Gonzalez, who had driven in 101 runs by the
All-Star break; and Seattle's Ken Griffey Jr., who has joined Babe
Ruth and Lou Gehrig as the only players in history to drive in at
least 140 runs in three consecutive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Ripken, baseball's iron man, who started his
consecutive-game playing streak the same year Caray started with
the Cubs and ended it the same year Caray bowed out, at an amazing
2,632 games.
</P>
<P>
   And leave it to Caray -- that kidder! -- to take a poke at the
buttoned-down baseball traditionalists. They saw their pastoral
illusions shattered in May when the Dodgers traded franchise player
Mike Piazza to the Florida Marlins, marking the start of a
season-long flea market with (blue and) white elephants galore.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' lineup and their front office have been nearly
gutted since Toronto's Roger Clemens lost his last game, on May 29.
Clemens should win his fifth Cy Young award this year, and it'll be
one long, fiendish winter -- Caray will personally see to that --
if Sosa doesn't win his first National League MVP award.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa is smart; he knows there's a wizard working behind the
scenes to make this baseball season so wondrous. That's why he
salutes Caray after every home run he hits.
</P>
<P>
   Having surpassed Maris' record and swept two countries -- his
native Dominican Republic and the United States -- off their feet,
Sosa was asked what's next on his goal sheet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go to heaven,'' he said merrily.
</P>
<P>
   Why, of course. How else is he gonna high-five Harry?

L.A. AREA SEEING RISE IN METH LABS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ALEX ROTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The discovery of two methamphetamine laboratories
in suburban West Hills last week was a lesson in simple economics
for police.
</P>
<P>
   Once relegated to remote outposts in high-desert communities,
meth labs are popping up in the city's San Fernando Valley area to
feed a voracious appetite from a new breed of users.
</P>
<P>
   Police call it the drug of the '90s -- a highly addictive form
of speed that gives users a feeling of invincibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's filtering out onto the street, to where it's starting
to rival cocaine. There are `call-out' people who you can call on
your pager,'' said Los Angeles police Detective Patrick Dammeier of
the Valley Narcotics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   What police and drug counselors alike are finding is that meth
is increasingly the choice among middle-class teen-agers and baby
boomers ``trying to rediscover the good old times,'' said state
Department of Justice spokesman Mike Van Winkle.
</P>
<P>
   In the San Fernando Valley, police say meth has begun making an
appearance on the streets of North Hollywood and Pacoima.
</P>
<P>
   ``Way back when, it was called `the poor man's cocaine,' '' said
Gregg McClung, special agent supervisor for the Bureau of Narcotic
Enforcement's Los Angeles field office. ``Now, in my opinion, it's
the drug of the '90s.''
</P>
<P>
   As of July, Los Angeles police had seized 2,403 pounds of
methamphetamine this year -- more than they seized in all of 1996
and 1997 combined.
</P>
<P>
   And for the first time, meth has begun to rival cocaine in terms
of poundage confiscated by the LAPD. So far this year, police have
seized 2,830 pounds of cocaine. Only two years ago, police seized
nearly 12 times as much cocaine as meth, according to LAPD
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The trend mirrors a similar one statewide. Last year, state
agents actually seized more methamphetamine than cocaine. By
comparison, in 1991 state agents seized roughly 30 times more
cocaine than meth.
</P>
<P>
   To meet the demand, relatively small methamphetamine labs are
turning up in densely populated areas of the Valley, despite the
risk that neighbors will smell the acrid fumes and call police.
</P>
<P>
   Glendale. Sylmar. San Fernando.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are all over,'' Dammeier said. ``You find them in a
little chicken ranch in Sylmar. You find them in the middle of a
normal neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   The state is responding by shifting 70 to 75 percent of its
anti-drug money to combating methamphetamine.
</P>
<P>
   Measured by the percentage of resources the state spends to
combat all drugs, methamphetamine is ``the Chicago Bulls -- it's
the champ every year and winning every time easily,'' Van Winkle
said. ``It used to be one of the four big drugs, but it's separated
itself from the pack.''
</P>
<P>
   While the laboratories in desert communities typically have fed
the drug to a nationwide network, the Valley's meth makers mostly
are small-time operations where the owner is making just enough for
personal use and to sell to a few friends. Police dub these
operations ``B&AMP;B labs'' -- which stands for the animated MTV
delinquents Beavis and Butt-head.
</P>
<P>
   ``With some of these recipes, they basically cook it in the Mr.
Coffee,'' Van Winkle said.
</P>
<P>
   Most disturbing to law enforcement and drug counselors alike is
that the appetite for methamphetamine has spread beyond motorcycle
gangs to the middle class.
</P>
<P>
   Users experience an enormous burst of energy -- indeed, some
couples take it to improve their sex lives. Others hope to increase
their productivity at work.
</P>
<P>
   Nicknamed ``ice,'' ``crank'' and ``crystal meth,'' the drug is
cheaper than cocaine and offers a high that can last four to five
times as long -- a high that can stretch 12 hours or more. Unlike
crack or heroin, it can be made with ingredients purchased over the
counter at a pharmacy. And anyone with access to the Internet can
find a recipe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that when you take speed, you work better,'' said
Douglas Anglin, director of the UCLA Drug Abuse Research Center.
``You can work more and you can get it done better. It is truly a
performance-enhancing drug.''
</P>
<P>
   These new users either ignore or don't realize the vicious side
effects, which include paranoia, violent outbursts and long-term
brain damage.
</P>
<P>
   Anglin said meth remains largely a drug of choice for white men,
although there's mounting evidence it's becoming popular among
Latinos. The drug hasn't found great popularity with
African-American drug users because they tend to be ``so cracked
out that we haven't seen a lot of move there,'' Anglin said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the Valley labs, the desert laboratories are
massive operations capable of churning out hundreds of pounds of
the drug.
</P>
<P>
   For the big-time producer, a $5,000 investment can buy enough
components to make $1 million worth of the drug. Wholesale, one
pound could be sold for $4,000 to $7,000, depending on quality. On
the street, at $100 a gram, it could bring in up to $45,000. The
drug is often sold in a $25 portion known as a ``quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   State narcotics agents have dubbed these operations ``super
labs.'' Many of these sites are run by Mexican nationals with ties
to nationwide rings.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement, one-fifth of
all seized labs are run by Mexican nationals.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its health dangers, the drug also poses an
enormous risk to the environment. The drug is manufactured using
chemicals such as Freon, iodine and phosphorus -- and every pound
of meth produces 5 pounds of waste, authorities estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the health threat, authorities are cracking down on
companies that sell the chemicals in bulk without complying with
new state regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It damages not only the plants and the critters out there, but
people too,'' said Dale Ferranto, special agent in charge of the
Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement's Los Angeles office. ``They pour it
down the drain, put it in the sewage, and it gets into the water
table, seeps into the aquifers.''

NOW STARTING AT FREE SAFETY, A MAN WHO WANTS TO STAY IN THE
LINEUP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.)  (bl) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   He calls his father the hardest working man in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty years of manual labor in a tractor factory,'' said the
New York Giants' Percy Ellsworth, who auditions for the starting
free safety job when he replaces the injured Tito Wooten on Sunday
in San Diego. ``He made sure I knew about that life. I did my three
summers at the plant as a teen-ager. No place for the soft.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellsworth's parents raised him in a strict household with early
curfews and a respect for schoolwork. In high school, the
Ellsworths pulled their youngest child Percy off the baseball team
because his grades had slumped. Worried it might happen again,
Ellsworth never did play baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Sundays in the Ellsworth household were spent in church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially if you went out the night before,'' Ellsworth said,
smiling at the memory as he stood on the Giants' practice field.
``I remember saying that when I went to college I'd never go to
church again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ended up going all the time. Still do. My parents did a
great job. I've never gotten into any trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, in the Giants' locker room, Ellsworth is one of the
most popular players.
</P>
<P>
   As Littleton Parker, his football coach at Southhampton High in
Virginia just a few miles from the North Carolina border, said,
``Percy's a gentleman and it's pretty hard to dislike him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellsworth is also appreciated for his instinctive defensive
wisdom. You can almost discern the path worn in the carpet around
Ellsworth's locker. Call it the playbook pilgrimage. A new, or
younger defensive back will come with book in hand and Percy
answers their questions.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, for all this, Ellsworth has heard the derogatory buzz
that has surrounded his three-year National Football League career.
The off-the-record talk is of on-the-field lapses, that he is as
liable to make a big play as give one up. There are whispers that
he has had poor practice habits and lacks a consistent commitment
and drive.
</P>
<P>
   When the subject is raised, the smile that comes naturally to
Ellsworth's face dissolves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prove it,'' he said. ``Tell me where I've given up a touchdown
this year? Show me the tape of me chasing my receiver down the
field. I've made some mistakes, but nowhere as many as some other
people have. I don't know where that's coming from, but I resent
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other years, maybe football had come naturally to me and I
didn't do everything I could. But this past year, I went into the
weight room. I was never a weight lifter, but I went in there and
did everything in the off-season conditioning program. Compare my
play, my practice, my condition now to others, it stands up.''
</P>
<P>
   The riddle of Ellsworth's career is that he has size (6 feet 3
inches, 225 pounds), speed, good instincts and all of five NFL
starts _ each of them because someone got hurt.
</P>
<P>
   A high school All-American in basketball and a first-team
All-American in football at the University of Virginia, he has a
habit of being wherever the ball is _ a key attribute for a safety
_ but he gets on the field usually only in the nickel and dime
defenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like my career is wasting away,'' he said. ``I never
thought my pro career would go like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Success in sports had always been a given for Ellsworth, who is
23.
</P>
<P>
   As a 14-year old high school sophomore, he made his first start
in a state semifinal playoff game. He picked off the first pass of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Percy has always had this knack for finding the ball and
taking it away,'' said fullback Charles Way, Ellsworth's teammate
on the Giants and at Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   As a Giant, he has seven interceptions in his five starts.
</P>
<P>
   His performance has not gone unnoticed around the league. Other
teams, including the Jets, have expressed interest in Ellsworth,
wondering if the Giants would unload him after Wooten had a
breakthrough year in 1997, and then, in the off-season signed a
four-year, $8 million contract. Those teams will get their chance
this winter when Ellsworth should be a restricted free agent.
Ellsworth said he wants to remain with the Giants, but the desire
to start may matter more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never want to play anywhere but the Giants,'' he said.
``It's funny because I was terrified to come here. I grew up in a
small Virginia town, I remember saying: `Please, Lord, don't let
the Giants or Jets draft me.'''
</P>
<P>
   They didn't, and neither did anyone else. He came to the Giants
as a rookie free agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it here now,'' Ellsworth said. ``But I didn't get into
football to be a career back-up. I figure this winter I'll be 24
years old with three years in the league and at least seven
interceptions and 20-something passes broken up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping somebody will say: `Maybe this kid can play.'''
</P>
<P>
   A favorite of former coach Dan Reeves, Ellsworth got off to a
rocky start with Jim Fassel's staff when he missed Fassel's first
spring mini-camp and never called to explain his absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``A mistake that I wish I could take back,'' said Ellsworth, who
said at the time that he was attending to some personal business.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel does not seem to hold a grudge, and Ellsworth has been on
the field for more than 60 percent of all the plays in Fassel's
tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've very comfortable with Percy,'' said Fassel, who also
hinted that he was considering replacing the struggling Wooten with
Ellsworth before Wooten strained his hamstring in last week's loss
to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Giants defensive coordinator John Fox acknowledged that
Ellsworth had rededicated himself during the winter. Fox said
Ellsworth exceeded every conditioning and strength goal the team
had set for him.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said there is no easy answer to why Ellsworth hasn't already
been a regular starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not always his fault,'' Fox said. ``When your defense is
playing well, and ours was last year, you tend to go with the guy
who is in there. I understand Percy must be frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect him for never showing that to us. He keeps trying.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel and Fox won't say so, Ellsworth has a very good chance to
unseat Wooten beyond this week if he plays well Sunday. Although
it's something Ellsworth doesn't believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that Tito's beaten me out for three straight
years,'' he said Friday, helmet in hand outside the locker room.
``They signed him to a big contract this winter. I don't feel in
any way, shape or form that it's my job.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine Wooten fading too far from the picture _
even though his history of off-field troubles makes him a gamble
for the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   In Ellsworth's favor is the design of the Giants' defense, which
is intended to force turnovers. If Ellsworth produces in that
regard and the Giants win, the same don't-change-what-isn't-broken
philosophy that kept Ellsworth out of the starting lineup could
keep him in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish the Giants coaches had asked me about him,'' Littleton
Parker said last week. ``I'd have told them that Percy worked hard
as a youngster and was raised right. He's always become one of the
most valuable players on any team that's been lucky enough to have
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellsworth _ plain-spoken and open with his opinions _ said he
just wants the whispers to stop and the frank evaluations to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can't do it and someone shows me that, then I'll shake
their hand and not bring it up again,'' he said. ``But until then,
I just want a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Sunday, Percy Ellsworth gets one.

U.S. UNIVERSITIES LOSING INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   American colleges and universities, long the world leaders in
attracting international students, are seeing the decline of their
dominance, government analysts and education officials reported on
Thursday at a conference in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Moving vigorously into the competition for international
students are Australia, Canada, Latin America, New Zealand and
members of the European Union, according to the Institute of
International Education, which makes an annual study of students
who travel abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't say we've lost our competitive edge, but we can no
longer take things for granted,'' said Joseph Duffey, director of
the U.S. Information Agency, which, with the Educational Testing
Service, sponsored the conference at the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is still by far the most popular destination
for foreign students, attracting about 458,000 in the 1996-97
academic year, the USIA said. Next was France, which draws about
170,000 foreign students every year, according to figures provided
by Unesco.
</P>
<P>
   The number of foreign students studying in the United States
increased steadily after World War II, but has been flat since
1993, speakers at the conference said.
</P>
<P>
   But, as the number of students studying in other countries has
risen, the United States' share has shrunk. Five years ago, about
40 percent of all international students studied in the United
States. Today, only 32 percent come here, according to USIA
figures.
</P>
<P>
   The decline was attributed to the relatively high cost of
American colleges and universities and to vigorous recruiting
efforts in recent years by colleges in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1990, for example, the number of international students
attending Australian colleges and universities has increased
tenfold.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Geiger, director of academic programs for the USIA, said:
``Australian universities are much cheaper than their counterparts
in the United States, and they are a whole lot closer to home for
people in Southeast Asia, which is the largest provider of
international students.''
</P>
<P>
   The decline in the number of foreign students attending colleges
and universities in the United States cannot be explained by the
Asian economic crisis because the decline began to unfold five
years ago; the Asian crisis began last year.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Trachtenberg, president of George Washington University,
who participated in the conference, called the leveling off of
foreign students in the United States ``the sincerest form of
flattery.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happened,'' Trachtenberg said in an interview, ``is
that after many foreign students have earned degrees from American
institutions they then use their knowledge and experience to
establish similar institutions in their home countries.''
</P>
<P>
   The way to reverse the trend, Duffey said in an interview, is
``to make our institutions more user-friendly, to explore things
like joint-degree programs, to see if there aren't unnecessary
barriers and to explore helpful partnerships with industry and
philanthropy.''
</P>
<P>
   Participants agreed that the effect of Asia's economic crisis
was only beginning to be felt.
</P>
<P>
   Nine of the 10 countries sending the greatest number of students
to the United States are Asian. Canada is the only non-Asian
country at the top of the list.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1996-97 academic year, according to the institute, Japan
supplied the largest number of international students, with 46,292.
China was next with 42,503 students, followed by South Korea
(37,130), India (30,641), Taiwan (30,487) and Canada (22,984).
Others on the top-10 list are Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   The financial crisis in Asia has forced many Asian students
studying abroad to seek cheaper housing, get part-time jobs or
transfer to colleges in countries where they could get a better
deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service has stepped in to
loosen work rules for foreign students. And a few colleges are
adjusting student grants to make up for falling exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
   But other colleges have not made adjustments, and increasing
numbers of students are finding that currency devaluations,
bankruptcies and stock market losses at home have put education in
the United States out of their reach.

YOUNG WHITE SOX SEEK TO PROVE THAT SECOND-HALF SURGE IS NO MIRAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't look for the Chicago White Sox in the playoffs this week.
They won't be there. But then, they aren't where anyone thought
they would be, based on their performance in the first half of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you told me at the All-Star break we were going to win
75-80 games, I'd have laughed at you,'' Ron Schueler, the White Sox
general manager, said.
</P>
<P>
   At the All-Star break the White Sox had a 35-51 record. Over a
full season that winning percentage (.407) would compute to a 66-96
record. But the White Sox have played so well in the second half of
the season (43-31) that they have a 78-82 record and Schueler can
legitimately laugh with enjoyment _ and relief. Only the Yankees
have had a better record (51-28) in that period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were awful young; we've gone through 11 rookies,'' Schueler
said, speaking of the first half. ``We just gave them a chance to
play. There was no pressure on them. The manager got to learn the
players, what they could and couldn't do. Give our scouting system
a lot of credit. We've brought up a lot of kids and they've
contributed. It was a gamble and it has worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the more prominent rookies have been 21-year-old Mike
Caruso, who became the team's shortstop after playing in Class A
last year, and Bob Howry, who became the team's closer after Matt
Karchner was traded to the Cubs. Their contributions have been
significant because they were two of the six minor league players
the White Sox acquired from San Francisco last season in the
controversial trade of Wilson Alvarez, Roberto Hernandez and Danny
Darwin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Caruso has been terrific, considering he came from A ball,''
Schueler said of the team's second-leading hitter.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 1 hitter is Albert Belle, who has been the American
League's most torrid hitter in the second half. After batting .278,
hitting 18 home runs and driving in 66 runs in 87 games before the
break, Belle has batted .378, hit 29 home runs and knocked in 82
runs in 74 games since.
</P>
<P>
   Entering Saturday's games, he led the league in total bases
(388) and slugging percentage (.645), was tied for the lead in
doubles (48), was second in home runs (47) and runs batted in (148)
and was fourth in hits (195) and in batting average (.324).
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he moved up on the plate, made some adjustments,''
Schueler said. ``It took a little time. What a second half he's
had.''
</P>
<P>
   Anything Belle does offensively _ and he has done much
offensively in his career _ does not surprise baseball people. The
White Sox, however, have produced something that has been truly
surprising: Jim Abbott. Out of talent seemingly and out of
baseball, Abbott has made a remarkable comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled to pitch Saturday night, the player who was born
without a right hand won his first four starts since working his
way back to the major leagues, his first two victories coming
against the division champion Yankees and Cleveland Indians. Abbott
was last in the majors in 1996, when he staggered to a 2-18 record
with the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   To what does Schueler attribute the stunning development?
``Learning how to pitch, believe it or not, at his age. Everything
used to be hard inside, hard inside. Now he's changing speeds,
using the outer part of the plate, learning how to throw soft.''
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox have also received workmanlike efforts from two
rookie pitchers, John Snyder (7-2) and Jim Parque (7-5), who had
made a combined eight starts before the break.
</P>
<P>
   James Baldwin, a relative veteran in his third year in the
majors, has been especially good in the second half, improving from
3-3 to 12-6.
</P>
<P>
   The question hanging over the new, improved White Sox is how
legitimate is their second-half surge.
</P>
<P>
   Large is the number of teams that, with no pressure, have played
well in the latter stages of a season, only to show the next season
it was all a mirage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it's not what you see with Detroit,'' Schueler said,
``where a lot of kids had great years last year but didn't
improve.''
</P>
<P>
   The general manager said he would like to be able to add some
good veteran players for next season, but that remained to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a budget yet; I don't know what Jerry's going to
do,'' he said, referring to Jerry Reinsdorf, the Sox owner. ``I
think you definitely need to get a couple veterans to take the
pressure off the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   If Reinsdorf provides the cash, Schueler said he would like a
No. 1 starter and left-handed relief help. The most attractive _
and most expensive _ starters who are eligible for free agency are
Randy Johnson, Kevin Brown, David Cone and Al Leiter. The White Sox
won't have any excess funds from their attendance to spend on a
pitcher of their caliber. At 1.4 million, they have the league's
third-lowest attendance.

   TALKING ABOUT ALOU
</P>
<P>
   Now that Kevin Malone, a former general manager with the
Montreal Expos, has that job with Los Angeles, the Dodgers are
expected to ask the Expos for permission to speak with Felipe Alou
about their about-to-be vacant managing job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear they're going to ask permission to talk with me,'' Alou
said. ``I don't know what the club is going to do.'' But if the
Expos are asked and say yes, Alou knows what he's going to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the club says yes, I believe the club has some other
plans,'' said the classy Dominican, who has managed the team for
seven seasons. ``I have been with them one quarter of a century. If
they say we'll let you go ahead and talk, they're sending you a
message. I'm not looking for a job, but I have to say if that is
the case, if permission is granted, I'm leaving. That's very simple
because permission has not been granted before and I know there
have been some feelers before.''
</P>
<P>
   The Expos, strapped for money, have profited previously from
permitting their personnel to go elsewhere. Dan Duquette's 1994
move to Boston as general manager brought the Expos $500,000.
Felipe could fetch $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ANGELS BEDEVILED
</P>
<P>
   Hey, Anaheim Angels, now that you've blown another division
championship, what are you going to?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to Disneyland. We get free tickets from our
owners, and we can spend all day in Fantasyland, pretending we
won.''
</P>
<P>
   For the third time in the past four seasons, the Angels have
squandered a first-place position late in the season. In 1995, they
had an 11-game lead early in August (13 over Seattle, which
ultimately won) and still led the American League West by 6 games
approaching mid-September. Then they lost nine games in a row and
tumbled out of first. In 1997, they were in first by half a game
Aug. 15, then won 16 games and lost 25 the rest of the season and
finished second.
</P>
<P>
   This season they held the top spot for 33 consecutive days (not
to mention 38 of 57 days before that stretch) before the Texas
Rangers caught them Sept. 16 with the first of their five victories
in five games against them. They clinched the division title for
the Rangers Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT'S IN A NAME?
</P>
<P>
   When the Philadelphia Phillies called up Marlon Anderson to play
second base for them for much of this last month of the season, it
marked the first time a player named Anderson played second base
for them since George Anderson played there for 152 games in 1959.
It would be his only major league season. Some years later Sparky,
as he was known, became one of the game's greatest managers.
</P>
<P>
   BASES, BASES AND MORE BASES
</P>
<P>
   With Sammy Sosa reaching the 400 plateau in total bases, major
league baseball has had players attain that level in successive
seasons for the first time in 60 years. Larry Walker did it last
season. Since 1937, the only other players to have at least 400
total bases were Stan Musial in 1948, Hank Aaron in 1959 and Jim
Rice in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa also has become only the fourth player (Babe Ruth, Jimmie
Foxx, Hack Wilson) to reach 50 home runs, 150 runs batted in and
400 total bases in the same season.
</P>
<P>
   When Sosa, Juan Gonzalez and Dean Palmer played for the Sarasota
Rangers in the Gulf Coast League in 1986, their first season as
professionals, they combined for 4 home runs and 76 RBI. This
season they have collectively hit 145 home runs and driven in 432
runs.
</P>
<P>
   WHEN THE BENCH IS A PROMOTION
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Schack, a players association lawyer who has been with
the union for 16 years, longer than any staff official except
executive director Donald Fehr, is a candidate for a 10-year term
on the bench of the Civil Court of New York City. The executive
committee of the Kings County Democratic Party nominated Schack
after a sitting judge, Bernard Fuchs, died.
</P>
<P>
   Schack, 53, is running in Brooklyn, which means the nomination
is tantamount to victory. No Democrat for the court has lost there
in this century.

 SPORTS COLUMN: FINDING A HUMAN DiMAGGIO UNDER THE MASK  
(bl) 
 By ROBERT LIPSYTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Of all the celebrants at Joe DiMaggio Day on Sunday,
none will treat the living legend as carefully, as vigilantly, as
reverently as Joltin' Joe himself. DiMaggio has always been his own
best curator.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, he put himself in a glass case, to be seen from a
distance and not touched. He has never embarrassed us by word or
misdeed, even declining to parody himself in old-timers games and
avoiding the sitdown interviews that might show that he has little
of interest to say.
</P>
<P>
   In return, it was easy to forgive him for making cheesy TV
commercials, and we have steadfastly refused to wallow in the
rumored details of his troubled marriage to Marilyn Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   The Clipper is clean. His courtliness and reserve make him seem
a romantic reclusive, a Garbo or Salinger among the sound biters in
a game so starved for heroes that a mere honest workman like Cal
Ripken becomes an instant icon before he is shelved for a ``lack of
run production.'' Incredibly, DiMaggio's name comes up among the
transcendent athletes of our time, Muhammad Ali, Michael Jordan and
Billie Jean King.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is because there is something so elusive and elegant
about DiMaggio that he seems mythic without being that significant
an historical figure. He was one of a number of talented
Italian-American athletes of the 1930s, and even though the Yankees
had several of them, manager Casey Stengel always referred to
DiMaggio with a slur that sounded like an honorific _ he called him
``the Dago.''
</P>
<P>
   Life magazine, in an early picture spread, complimented him on
his speech _ DiMaggio did not talk with his hands. He was marked as
a role model for a nation of immigrants, a high school dropout, son
of a fisherman.
</P>
<P>
   The dignity with which he carried himself on the field was more
than matched in public as a civilian; the way he took charge of
Monroe's funeral and then ordered roses on her grave forever lifted
him above the players of Washington and Hollywood who had used and
discarded her.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio has always seemed like a grown-up. I first saw him in
the summer of 1951, when I was 13 and drawn to Yankee Stadium by
another teen-ager, Mickey Mantle. But through the course of the
game it was DiMaggio, at the end of his career, who captured my
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   He had few chances, but it did seem as if he ``drifted,'' as the
radio broadcasters would say, under fly balls. He moved, or at
least shifted his weight, with the pitch, then flowed into motion
with the crack of the bat. He would arrive at the ball just in
time, without fuss. The rest of the time in center field, he seemed
relaxed but alert of the game. What was he thinking about out
there, I wondered. Unlike me in the outfield, probably not snacks
and girls.
</P>
<P>
   The next time I saw him, I almost ran into him. This was on a
gray, chilly spring training day in 1967, in Fort Lauderdale. I was
reading a roster and his head was down to avoid eye contact as we
nearly collided in a concrete chute that led from the Yankee locker
room out to the field.
</P>
<P>
   He had been hired for public relations, yet avoided the press.
This was less than five years after Monroe's death, and she was
still a hot topic. Face to face with me, he froze; with his long,
melancholy face, the deer-in-the-headlights cliche seemed apropos.
</P>
<P>
   After an embarrassingly long time, I finally blurted, ``Not
baseball weather.''
</P>
<P>
   He blinked, took a breath and looked up. ``That's an
outfielder's sky.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, as if he were Michelangelo describing the ceiling of
the Sistine Chapel, he talked about the roof of his world, about
the danger of losing balls in the clouds as easily as in the sun,
about smog and shadows and smoke, about the line of the ball,
rising or looping, about the spin.
</P>
<P>
   Now I was frozen. I took no notes, I barely breathed, afraid to
break the spell. I think I understood (but maybe I inserted the
revelation later) that he hadn't just ``drifted'' after all, that
he was a scholar, that he had prepared for every kind of patch of
blue sky, every burst of sun.
</P>
<P>
   He paused only once, to notice I was shivering. ``Rook,'' he
roared at a young pitcher sprinting by, ``Get this man a jacket.''
</P>
<P>
   We might be talking still, but a Yankee PR official made a big
show of rescuing DiMaggio from a media ambush. DiMaggio seemed
reluctant to go. The PR man said DiMaggio was late for an
appointment. It sounded like a lie, but DiMaggio was too much the
gentleman to show the man up. He said goodbye and gravely shook my
hand.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, I sent a published account of our meeting to DiMaggio
in an attempt to get a rare long interview for television. When we
met, again at spring training, he said he had read the piece and
remembered our meeting, but didn't want to be interviewed just yet.
</P>
<P>
   But if I showed up at 10 a.m. on Old-Timers' Day in the Yankee
locker-room that summer, he would do it then. Over the next few
months, I was unable to reconfirm the date; he and his
representatives never called back.
</P>
<P>
   But I was sure he would remember and show up. This was Joe
DiMaggio! He meant what he said! The producer Brett Alexander and I
talked our show, ``CBS Sunday Morning With Charles Kuralt,'' into
letting us go to the Stadium with a crew on what was considered a
very long shot.
</P>
<P>
   He was there, waiting for us, tapping his foot impatiently.
``Where've you been? I've been here an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 10:05 a.m. We set up in the Yankee dugout, but the
public-address system was being tested and drowned our audio. This
had happened before. There was no recourse. No interview. We
explained this to DiMaggio, who lifted an eyebrow, then summoned a
Yankee official to bring him a telephone. In a moment there was
silence. Who else but the great DiMaggio could hush the Stadium?
</P>
<P>
   The rest was anticlimax. It was a long interview and I can read
my sweat in the transcript. He was cooperative, even chatty, but
his insights about baseball in his time, his fellow players, New
York in the 1930s and '40s when he owned the night, were shallow.
</P>
<P>
   He could be very precise about individual games, even at-bats
and catches, and about his various injuries and ailments, including
ulcers. He ``loved'' playing, he said, and poured into it all his
energy and emotion. But it wasn't easy, he said; he always had ``a
knot'' in his stomach because he was so shy and tense. He indicated
that those were the feelings that dominated his life _ only now was
the knot unraveling, he said _ but he could not or would not go
deeper than that.
</P>
<P>
   He had little to say about contemporary baseball, and his
wonderment at the Simon and Garfunkel line, ``Where have you gone,
Joe DiMaggio?'' seemed sad; at first, he had thought it might be an
insult, and later was flattered.
</P>
<P>
   Who could ever suggest that the truth might be simpler, that the
five melodic syllables of his name fit a lyric? Babe Ruth, Joe
Louis, Babe Didrikson just didn't scan.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter, of course, for anyone who ever found meaning
or beauty or inspiration in the grace that masked his painful
intensity and the myth that still hides the parts of him that are
merely human.

<P>
   Saturday, Hurricane Georges continued to forge northwest over
the Gulf of Mexico, heading for a stormy rendezvous with the
northern Gulf Coast. But as high-altitude steering winds over the
Gulf of Mexico weakened, Hurricane Georges began to slow down.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the storm will likely stay off the central Gulf Coast for
much of Sunday, churning slowly northwest while strengthening.
However, outer rain bands associated with Hurricane Georges will
reach the central Gulf States, with fitful and gusty showers and
thunderstorms affecting areas within 150 miles of the coast. Humid
air drawn inland from the Atlantic by the storm will also fuel
thunderstorms in southern Georgia and southern Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a broken line of scattered showers and isolated
thundershowers will escort a cold front into the Northeast. Before
showers arrive at the Northeast seaboard, humid, unseasonably warm
conditions will prevail. Behind the front, cool winds from the
northwest averaging 15 to 25 mph will sweep across the Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Farther west, scattered showers and a few thundershowers will
develop over parts of California and Nevada as an upper-level low
pressure system drifts eastward. North of the upper-level low,
winds will blow offshore over northwest Oregon and western
Washington, setting the stage for a mostly sunny, seasonably warm
day.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of western Kansas, where temperatures soared to 100
degrees or higher Friday and Saturday, will cool down Sunday as
clouds and showers associated with a cool front arrive.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: GROWING CONCERN
</P>
<P>
   A hurricane watch was issued late Friday along the Gulf Coast
from Morgan City, La., to St. Marks on the Florida panhandle as the
center of Hurricane Georges moved northwestward away from the
Florida Keys. A hurricane watch means that hurricane-force winds
are possible within 36 hours. By contrast, a hurricane warning
means that hurricane-force winds are expected within 24 hours. The
timing of Georges' next landfall will become more difficult to
assess as high-altitude steering winds over the Gulf of Mexico
continue to relax, setting the stage for the hurricane to slow
down.

 FOOTBALL COLUMN: HEARST'S RUNNING HAS 49ers ROLLING  
(bl) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   San Francisco has the early look of a Super Bowl team.
</P>
<P>
   Think of all of the super 49er teams and consider this: None of
them produced consecutive 500-yard offensive games. No 49er team
had since 1961. But this bunch did against the Jets (a 36-30
victory in overtime) and against Washington (a 45-10 victory).
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta plays at San Francisco on Sunday after a bye week for
both 2-0 teams. It is an early test of National Conference West
supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta has not won in San Francisco in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to win there because the 49er defense is usually
unheralded but sound. San Francisco's special teams produce big
plays. The 49ers' passing game is always of the highest order.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco safety Merton Hanks offers the prime reason no
team may catch the 49ers this season. ``Garrison Hearst is really
running that thang,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The way the 49ers play football, if they get the running game
going, it is like water to flowers. Like gasoline to a car. Like
yeast to bread. Everything rises.
</P>
<P>
   With all of their other supreme elements _ especially the
passing arm of the wily Steve Young, the fear provided by the star
receiver Jerry Rice and the brute force offered by linebacker Ken
Norton _ if the 49ers' running game clicks for them, they hum.
</P>
<P>
   It is clicking. They are humming.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst, 27, is now in his sixth pro season.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in Lincolnton, Ga., and played football at the
University of Georgia. He was the third pick in the 1993 draft by
Arizona. He played in six Cardinals games before a knee injury
ruined his rookie year, and it looked as if it might ruin his pro
career. Arizona waived him in '96 and the Cincinnati Bengals
grabbed him.
</P>
<P>
   That one year in Cincinnati was torture for Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to look back,'' Hearst said, with obvious pain in
his eyes at just the mention of the Bengals. ``It was like I was
another person and player there. I did not have support, and I was
with an organization that wasn't at its best. And a lot of it was
my fault because I did not respond or play well there.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco signed him as a free agent last year and he
promptly rushed for 1,019 yards, the first 49er running back to top
1,000-yard rushing yards since Ricky Watters in 1992. In the 13th
game, Hearst broke his left clavicle and missed the next four,
including the playoffs. At that time, only Barry Sanders of Detroit
and Dorsey Levens of Green Bay had outrushed him.
</P>
<P>
   He is back now and he looks quicker and faster and more
comfortable. He is exploding through holes. He is bouncing it
outside with flair and running inside with determination. He is
catching the football, too, and breaking downfield.
</P>
<P>
   Even with last week off, Hearst ranks second in the NFL in
rushing with 325 yards on 42 attempts (187 rushing yards against
the Jets, 138 versus Washington). That is the most yards any 49er
back has gained in the first two games. It is the most for an NFL
back in Weeks 1 and 2 in the '90s. Hearst is averaging an
incredible 7.7 yards a carry.
</P>
<P>
   He is 5 feet 11 inches, 219 pounds. He does not look that big,
but he packs a punch. He is soft-spoken and hard-working.
</P>
<P>
   ``Garrison Hearst is just a good running back,'' Steve Mariucci,
the 49ers' head coach, said. ``I mean, a really good back. He has
strong balance. He's hard to tackle. He feels more comfortable with
us this year. He is going to have a heck of a year if he stays
healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers are showing that they know what they have in Hearst
and how to use him. He gets the ball often enough in both the
running and passing game. He gets it frequently in ways where he
can run with the football outside the defense, on the edges. Then
he explodes. He looks faster than he did before his injuries. That
is rare in football.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm not that big,'' Hearst said, smiling. ``But my heart
is much bigger than most. I've got the big guys in front of me and
that's all I need.''
</P>
<P>
   He gives the 49ers what they need: a go-to-back. The water, the
gasoline, the yeast. If he keeps this up, the 49ers could gain
home-field advantage throughout the playoffs in the National
Football Conference. And reach way beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   They play a Falcons team that has not allowed a 100-yard rusher
in 10 consecutive games, a team that has won 7 of its past 8 games
and a team with a running back of its own who is running wild.
Jamal Anderson has rushed for 162 yards in his first two games;
last season he rushed for 75 in his first two.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco feels prepared. It is 12-4 versus Atlanta in the
'90s.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco has only four games all season against playoff
teams from a year ago (at Green Bay and at New England, and home
against the Giants and Detroit). Right now, Green Bay looks like
the only team that can handle the 49ers. We are talking potential
for a 15-1 San Francisco regular season.
</P>
<P>
   That is a mouthful. Right now, just a 49ers dream.
</P>
<P>
   But with Hearst running wild mixed in with the rest of the
49ers' jewels, it is quite possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not win them all,'' Hearst said, winking.
</P>
<P>
   Run the table, then. Run that thang.

   FRAMINGHAM, Mass. _ If all the Americans who owe some of the
length or quality of their lives to the Framingham Heart Study were
to express their gratitude by attending its 50th anniversary gala
on Sunday afternoon, the auditorium would need millions upon
millions of folding chairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be fair to say that Framingham has arguably
contributed more than any other town in the United States to
advance the health of our nation,'' said Dr. Daniel Levy, the
study's director, who will be at the gala.
</P>
<P>
   So for a back-patting moment on Sunday, the study's staff will
focus not on drawing blood and measuring heartbeats and crunching
statistics, but on thanking the thousands of participants from this
midsized Massachusetts everytown who have become some of the most
famous and faithful guinea pigs in the world.
</P>
<P>
   For 50 years now, they have remained willing to be periodically
prodded, electroded, treadmilled, interrogated and _ the least
favorite test _ shouted at to blow, ever longer, into a tube that
measures lung capacity. And thanks in part to that willingness,
medical knowledge has so advanced that it has helped cut the
American death rate from cardiovascular disease by more than half
over the last 30 years, Levy said.
</P>
<P>
   Though cardiovascular disease remains the country's leading
cause of death, that death rate continues to drop, according to
1996 statistics published by the National Heart, Lung and Blood
Institute, which sponsors the Framingham study.
</P>
<P>
   When the U.S. Public Health Service, concerned about the soaring
coronary disease rate, began the study in 1948, no one in that
meat-eggs-and-butter era had documented the harmful effects of
cholesterol. Nor had they cemented the link between heart disease
and smoking, high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes, menopause,
stress _ all risk factors (a term coined by the study) so familiar
today.
</P>
<P>
   Neither had anyone established how significantly exercise helped
the heart _ in fact, exercise used to be considered dangerous for
people at risk for heart disease _ and how greatly preventive
measures like taking blood-pressure medication and quitting smoking
could reduce the likelihood of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   The Framingham study helped scientists determine all of those
things. Its findings led to clinical trials that proved the
benefits of reducing risk factors, which in turn led to the
aggressively preventive approach to fighting heart disease that is
now in practice.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it was the doctors and researchers associated with
the study who produced more than 1,000 scientific papers and
disseminated the information that has changed so many American
habits and saved so many lives. But, as they plan to point out
humbly on Sunday, they could have done none of it without the
people _ more than 6,000 of them still living, and about 4,000 who
are dead _ whose multigenerational cooperation helped make the
study one of the most important in medical history.
</P>
<P>
   The study's relationship with its subjects is a happy symbiosis.
Participants give their time and access to information about them
that ranges from the contents of their blood and workings of their
organs to a detailed description of their diet. In return, they
receive the knowledge that they are doing good and, every couple of
years or so, a physical exam so intensive it takes a half-day to do
it.
</P>
<P>
   The study does not offer participants medical treatment, but
rather reports all results to their doctors. No money changes
hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mainly, it's an honor to participate in something that's going
to benefit people long after we're gone,'' said Elaine Prince, 76,
who went with her father for her first heart study exam in October
1948.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's a two-way street,'' said her husband, Donald, 88.
``You get a lot of examination beyond the scope of what a physician
would do, and free of charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-year participants like the Princes, among the first bunch
of 5,209 people, are known as the original cohort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how many times I've heard, `I'm an original,
you know,''' said Sue Anderson, the study's clinic manager. ``They
feel like they're celebrities.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, the study, which had originally been planned to last
only 20 years, expanded to include more than 5,000 of the original
cohort's children. And in 1995, it expanded yet again to include
more than 500 minority participants.
</P>
<P>
   It has also continually added new areas of research, so that it
tracks not only heart disease but osteoporosis, dementia, cancer,
diabetes and more. Recently, it has also shifted more toward
genetic research, using its library of more than 5,000 DNA samples
to begin examining questions of genetic causes for high blood
pressure, cholesterol and the like. It also continues to examine
new possible risk factors that may contribute to heart disease,
like infectious agents and the amino acid homocysteine.
</P>
<P>
   That flexibility is one of the study's great strengths, said
Meir Stampfer, a professor of epidemiology at the Harvard School of
Public Health. As major studies go, he said, the Framingham study
is far from extraordinary in its size; the Harvard Nurses' Health
Study, for example, looks at more than 100,000 participants.
</P>
<P>
   But the Framingham study, because it is community-based, has
been able to bring participants in for unusually close study, he
said, and has also distinguished itself ``by never being content to
just keep redoing the same thing over and over.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Stampfer noted, it has proved a fine investment of
tax dollars: just $43 million from 1950 through 1997.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For families like the Princes, the study's evolution means that
Donald, Elaine, and four of their six children could sit in the
parlor of their wedding-cake house recently and recall the
different tests they have undergone over the years. There have been
hearing tests, memory tests, X-rays, bone scans, urology tests. A
few years ago, they recalled, samples of their hair had been taken,
though they did not know why.
</P>
<P>
   (It was a project looking for obscure trace elements and trying
to link them to disease rates, Levy said, when asked later.)
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Prince, 47, recalled a sleep breathing test that
required being hooked up to multiple electrodes all night. (The
study was part of a national effort to learn more about the
prevalence and effects of disordered breathing during sleep.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awfully hard to sleep with those things on,'' he
recalled. ``I found out that all my dreams are at the end of the
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, in the waiting room of the heart study's no-frills
clinic housed in a former convent, Cynthia Liss, a 52-year-old
secretary, had not-so-fond memories of that sleep study as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the most comfortable thing to do, but I said, `For
science, I'll do it,''' she said. ``Whatever they've called us to
do, we've done.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is one thing the participants seem to want most, said
Marian Bellwood, a participant coordinator at the study for the
last 24 years, it is that their children now be included in the
study as well. She is asked several times a day, she said, ``When
can my children join?''
</P>
<P>
   The study's current financing contract, which runs until 2001,
does not include money for a new generation, but Levy said he hoped
the money would come through in the next round.
</P>
<P>
   As she sat in the clinic waiting room in between tests, a paper
heart with her name on it stapled to her robe, Cynthia Liss said
she had similar hopes. ``I'm just looking forward to the time they
can take our children,'' she said.

MANHATTAN PRINTERS OUSTED FOR CLEANER, BETTER-PAYING TENANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Harold Russell has to yell to be heard above the roar
of the Miehle Roland presses churning out 25,000 brochures for an
insurance company. The pungent smell of ink envelops the shop floor
like a thick cloud.
</P>
<P>
   Down the hallway, in Russell's office at 480 Canal St., near the
entrance to the Holland Tunnel, is the black skeleton of a
100-year-old Kelly letterpress and an oak time clock in which he
punched his first timecard, at the age of 9. Earlier this month as
he passed by the ancient clock, which runs 20 minutes slow,
Russell, now 56, said he believed that time was finally running out
for the printing industry in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Russell's landlord, Trinity Church, has put him and dozens of
other printers on notice that the church will not renew their
leases in its buildings in the 70-year-old printing district, near
the Holland Tunnel. Other landlords are following suit, replacing
printers who pay $10 a square foot with advertising agencies and
other office tenants that will pay $25 to $30.
</P>
<P>
   The current real estate boom, which has sent office tenants
scurrying into industrial districts in search of cheaper rents, is
threatening to wipe out what was once the second-largest
manufacturing industry in the city. The printers say they will be
forced to move to New Jersey, or even to close, if they cannot find
industrial space close to their corporate clients, who want, in the
words of Russell, to ``sniff and touch'' the sheets as they roll
off the presses.
</P>
<P>
   Even if commercial printing no longer accounts for one out of
every seven factory jobs in the city, as it did during the 1920s,
printers say the industry does provide skilled, relatively
well-paid jobs and critical services for financial, advertising and
entertainment companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the very short years to come, manufacturing will cease to
exist in Manhattan,'' said Russell, president of the Skillcraft
Group and a third-generation printer. ``They want boutique shops.
They say printers are dirty, so they don't want us. Between
technological changes in the industry and real estate, we're really
shoveling against the tide.''
</P>
<P>
   Trinity Church, at Broadway and Wall Street, is not the only
landlord with printing tenants, but it is the largest in the
printing district, which extends west from Avenue of the Americas
to Hudson Street and north from Vestry Street to West Houston
Street. Printers occupy about a sixth of the 15 buildings and 5.5
million square feet of space owned by the church. Trinity's
decision to convert all but one of its remaining factory buildings
to office space is forcing about 60 printers to hunt for new homes.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Heyman, director for leasing at Trinity Real Estate,
said the church could no longer afford low rents and special deals
for printers. These tenants, with their heavy presses and busy
loading docks, will have to go, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The highest and best use for our portfolio is office space,''
Heyman said. ``We decided to let the charitable work of the church
be run by those who run charities. So we've been unwilling to renew
or extend space to printers. You can't have a mixed-use building
with printers. They're dirty. They make a lot of noise. The noise
drives away a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Other owners of buildings that house printers are also seeking
quieter, more lucrative tenants.
</P>
<P>
   In the garment district south of Times Square, office tenants
are pushing their way in and pushing up rents, forcing out
manufacturers. Some large printers like Tanagraphic own their
buildings and are unaffected by the roiling real estate market. But
most of the printers are family-owned businesses that lease space,
and they say the expense of moving, which can run to several
hundred thousand dollars or more, is a serious burden.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Gimbel, president of Xerographic Reproduction Center, at
516 W. 34th St., said he wanted to expand his space to 50,000
square feet from 35,000, but his landlord, who is converting the
building to office space and selling it, refused even to renew his
lease. Gimbel's company is not an outmoded print shop on the verge
of extinction; it is a computerized digital operation whose
lifeblood is toner, rather than ink.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost of picking up and moving is in excess of $1
million,'' Gimbel said. ``We'd rather put that into equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   Downtown, Joseph Gitto, the president of Imtech, another digital
printer whose clients are mainly investment banks, faces the same
problem. He said his landlord at 130 Cedar St., a longtime
printers' building where he has rented 32,000 square feet for a
decade, wanted him out, even before his lease expires in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   New York has been hemorrhaging manufacturing jobs since the
1950s, and many of those jobs will probably never return. But urban
planners and economic development specialists say the city needs to
encourage manufacturers producing specialized, high-quality
products with ties to local markets, like computer software
businesses, apparel makers that can produce goods quickly, or
printers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every major real estate cycle, there's somebody getting
squeezed out of low-cost space in Manhattan,'' said Hugh O'Neil,
president of Appleseed, an economic consulting company. ``But the
city's land use and development policies need to insure that some
space remains available in Manhattan for blue-collar industries
that support finance and business services, the media and the arts,
or you could have the perverse effect of making Manhattan less
attractive for those high-value activities.''
</P>
<P>
   City Planning Department Chairman Joseph Rose agreed, saying he
had opposed efforts by landlords and speculators seeking zoning
changes to convert industrial buildings to apartment houses in
active manufacturing areas in Manhattan. But there is little he can
do to stop the transformation of the printing district, he said.
</P>
<P>
   About two dozen printers have banded together with the
Association of Graphic Communications, a trade association
representing 540 companies in and around New York City, to hire a
real estate broker to find a building or buildings in Manhattan
that could serve as a new center for printers, binders and
engravers.
</P>
<P>
   Association president William Dirzulaitis said the group had
talked with city and state officials about getting help with moving
expenses and electricity costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor has been good when it comes to helping the commodity
exchange, Conde Nast and the Yankees,'' Dirzulaitis said. ``Here's
a whole industry segment that could be lost if something isn't
brought to the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Many printers are wary of alternative sites recommended by the
city, like the Brooklyn Army Terminal or Long Island City, because
they are hard to reach by truck or by public transportation.
Trinity has set aside space for printers at 200 Hudson St., but
Michael Geoghegan, a broker at Insignia/Edward S. Gordon who is
working for the printers, said there was little room left there.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of celebrating the 75th anniversary of the company their
grandfather started, Larry and Arthur Paladino, the owners of
Palographia, one of the largest engravers in the city, at 175
Varick St., are desperately looking for space in Brooklyn, Queens
and Jersey City, N.J. Their landlord has refused to renew their
lease.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of small printers like myself are going to get wiped
out,'' Larry Paladino said. ``I can't go home and tell my three
kids that Daddy doesn't work anymore. I guess I could get a cart
and stand in front of all these office buildings and sell hot
dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Printers began moving to Hudson and Varick Streets in the 1920s
to escape the congestion in lower Manhattan and to be closer to the
Holland Tunnel, then under construction. At the time, nearly a
quarter of all the commercial printing in the country was done in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Trinity Church, which had owned a large piece of Manhattan under
a 1705 land grant from Queen Anne of England, ended up with many of
the factory buildings during the Depression. By the start of this
century, the church had already disposed of much of its property,
by either selling it or giving it to Columbia University. The
church leased some of the land it kept to developers who built
printing factories. And when the economy collapsed and the
developers defaulted on their mortgages, the church bought the
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, Trinity and the printing industry have been buffeted
by technological change and the vagaries of the economy. In the
1980s, Heyman said, companies leasing 3 million of the church's 5.5
million square feet of real estate failed. Like many landlords,
Heyman said, Trinity cut rents to help printers survive.
</P>
<P>
   The church also has sought to gentrify the neighborhood, and
named it Hudson Square. In the 1980s, Trinity leased land to
Tishman Speyer, which built 375 Hudson St., home to Saatchi &AMP;
Saatchi DFS, an advertising agency. Later, Della Femina, McNamee
WCRS moved into another Trinity property, 350 Hudson St. Chic
restaurants like the Buddha Bar, Hudson Grill and Triplets replaced
printers' hangouts like Renato's on Vandam and the Printer's Pub at
480 Canal St.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Heyman said, Trinity is pouring money into transforming its
largest building, 75 Varick Street, into 1 Hudson Square, enlarging
the lobby, converting freight elevators to passenger use and
installing a new air conditioning system. At 480 Canal St., Trinity
has already leased part of the building to a caterer.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Mastellone, president of D&AMP;L Offset Lithography, is
particularly incensed by the conversion at 75 Varick St. Ten years
ago, he spent about $1.5 million moving his company there from
Trinity's building at 100 Avenue of the Americas. ``We were told at
the time that they had no plans to turn this building over to
office space,'' Mastellone said. ``We tried to get something in
writing, but they said they could not do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Alice Langon and her sons moved their
engraving operation, I. Scheff, to West Babylon, N.Y., after 70
years at 480 Canal St.
</P>
<P>
   George Linder, president of Linder &AMP; Co., another small printer
at 480 Canal, has decided to go to Jersey City. ``We're one of the
first to leave, but our location will be easy to find in another
two to three years,'' said Linder, a fourth-generation printer,
``because the printing industry is leaving Manhattan.''
</P>
<P>
   But most printers worry that they will lose many customers by
leaving Manhattan. Given the boom-and-bust nature of real estate,
they say Trinity is being short-sighted in ousting its longtime
tenants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just getting clobbered,'' said William Abrams, vice
president of AGW Lithographers at 225 Varick St., a Trinity-owned
building near Houston Street. ``When this building was half empty,
we still were paying our rent in a timely fashion. All of a sudden
we're not good tenants. The market will face another downturn and
we'll probably look like good tenants again.''

 By LINDA GREENHOUSE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The new federal courthouse that opened for business on
a spectacular waterfront site here last week is in many ways the
first of its kind in modern judicial architecture: a building
designed to welcome rather than intimidate, to invite the public to
stop by for a meal, an art exhibit, a film festival, a chamber
music concert or a stroll through the new two-acre ``harbor park''
that surrounds the building. There is even a floating boat dock,
although the only boat tied up there during Friday's opening
ceremony was a Boston police cruiser named the Due Process.
</P>
<P>
   The brick building, with its curving, seven-story glass wall, 21
Ellsworth Kelly paintings and more public space than any federal
courthouse in the country, promises to be a resounding success, the
expected anchor of a resurgent South Boston neighborhood. In fact,
the only cloud hanging over Friday's official celebration was the
question of whether this ambitious and creative $220 million
project might be not only the first of its kind, but also the last.
</P>
<P>
   For the second fiscal year in a row, the Office of Management
and Budget has declined even to request a capital appropriation for
courthouse construction. Plans long in the works, like an 18-story
courthouse for downtown Brooklyn, face delays and budget-driven
demands for cutbacks. Members of Congress, rarely known to stint on
their own office space, have for years tried to make the project
here a symbol of judicial excess, although its construction cost of
$200 a square foot is comparatively modest and the building came in
on budget and on time.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 people will work in the courthouse on Fan Pier. It
will serve as headquarters for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
1st Circuit and for the U.S. District Court for the District of
Massachusetts, as well as for Boston-based federal prosecutors and
marshals. It replaces cramped and outdated quarters the federal
courts here shared with other federal agencies in a 65-year old
post office building downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Though the need for a new courthouse was clear, here and
elsewhere, the future of the General Services Administration's $8
billion, 13-year program to construct or renovate more than 150
courthouses around the country _ the biggest public construction
program since the New Deal _ is nonetheless in question. Despite
recent indications that members of Congress, pressed by community
leaders in their districts, may add some construction money to the
1999 budget, it is likely that the expansive era in which the
Boston courthouse was conceived nearly a decade ago has come to an
end.
</P>
<P>
   So in a way, the many events here this weekend _ including the
official dedication on Friday, a daylong public open house Saturday
and a Boston Bar Association dinner for 600 guests in the
courthouse on Monday night _ celebrate not only a notable new
building but a particular moment in history, an elusive combination
of time, place and personality that brought it into being.
</P>
<P>
   As the speeches on Friday emphasized, this courthouse reflects
not only the vision of its architect, Henry Cobb of Pei Cobb Freed
&AMP; Partners, but to an unusual degree that of the judges who will
work here. The driving force behind the project was Stephen Breyer,
now a Supreme Court justice but for nearly 14 years before that a
judge on the 1st Circuit. As chief judge of the circuit from 1990
to 1994, Breyer took an intense hands-on role, as did District
Judge Douglas Woodlock, a student of architectural history who
writes and lectures on the subject and received an award two years
ago from the American Institute of Architects.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview at the Supreme Court, Breyer recalled the
moment it became clear that Cobb, a partner of I.M. Pei's, was the
right architect for the job. ``Other architects, knowing this was a
public building, started talking about how many plumbing fixtures
there should be,'' Breyer said. ``Harry showed us a picture of a
one-room 17th-century brick courthouse in Virginia, with a front
porch where people gathered. We said, `Where's the courthouse?' and
he said, `That's the room behind the porch.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The idea, Breyer said, was to take the court back to the
community. ``Courthouses today are like jails, or at best like
office buildings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a courtroom, a person actually meets face to face with the
high government official who will decide what that person is
entitled to,'' Breyer continued. ``That ideal was what the building
had to facilitate. In microcosm, it's about the relationship
between judge and litigant; in macrocosm, the relationship of the
citizen to the court.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was a tall order, at once abstract and self-conscious. It
translated into 27 courtrooms that do away with the grand elevated
bench. Judges sit behind a bench, but only three steps above floor
level, the better to take part in the courtroom ``discussion,''
Breyer explained. ``The courtroom belongs to the litigants and
counsel,'' he said. ``A judge is not a king. A judge is part of the
furniture.'' Courtroom spectators will sit on benches designed to
be reminiscent of a New England town meeting.
</P>
<P>
   To this heady symbolic stew, the architect added his own
imagery. The dramatically curved 33,000-square-foot glass wall
facing the harbor, Cobb said, is intended to convey the message
that ``our system of justice is transparent; it is accessible, not
hidden away.'' The building ``is connected to the life of this
town,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The public spaces in the building have the best views, with the
glass-walled corridors creating a kind of interior streetscape from
which people enter individual courtrooms . The entire effect could
not be more different from the federal courthouse that opened two
years ago in lower Manhattan, a 27-story granite tower that is as
uninviting as it is imposing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Courthouses are inherently intimidating,'' said Judge Sandra
Lynch, who succeeded Breyer on the 1st Circuit. ``They represent
high-risk propositions for people. It's very important for the
building to be welcoming, to offset that.'' The Boston Bar
Association, which Ms. Lynch led before she became a judge, has
taken an unusual role in the project, setting up a public education
foundation that has raised more than $400,000 from area lawyers to
support community programming in the building.
</P>
<P>
   Through film festivals, symposiums and programs for children in
connection with the nearby Boston Children's Museum, the aim is to
get people into the building, Thomas Dwyer Jr., the bar
association's president-elect, said in an interview. He noted that
in recent years, rulings by the federal court here had transformed
Boston's harbor, jails and schools. ``The court has been a focal
point of community life here, and we want to help people understand
what the law is all about,'' he said.

<P>
   TEWKSBURY, N.J. _ When Bill Ingraham was growing up in the late
1950s, baseball was a gang of friends playing endless pickup games
in a make-do field formed by the Passaic Avenue offramp at Route 3
in Clifton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would play all day,'' Ingraham recalled. ``I'd get 50 or 60
at-bats. Kids these days are limited to one game a week, and they
get three, maybe four at-bats. They're not going to learn the
fundamentals that way.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ingraham, 44, is a successful manufacturer of peel-and-stick
shipping labels, and success in business has allowed him to give
his 11-year-old son, Brian, the kind of playing time that a vacant
field once offered him. So in the summer of 1997, behind his
immense new house here in the heart of New Jersey horse country, in
the same town where Gov. Christie Whitman lives, Ingraham built a
full-size ball field to major-league specifications, with a
regulation clay infield _ the same three clays used at Yankee
Stadium, he says _ and a 5,000-square-foot gymnasium for batting
practice and winter basketball games.
</P>
<P>
   Brian loves the field. Brian's friends, who show up every day,
love it, too. But Ingraham's neighbors see things differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been worse than anything you can imagine,'' said
Kathleen DeSerio, a garden designer and hairdresser who has worked
for seven years to restore her 1,500-square-foot Cape Cod-style
house on the lot adjoining Ingraham's left field. ``My house is
finally to the point where it is livable, and it is really quite
beautiful, and now I have Fenway Park behind me. The only person
who hasn't shown up is Kevin Costner.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems that a three-acre ball field is not what the neighbors
moved out here to see, or hear. Last summer, pickup teams regularly
held games on the diamond on weekends. The ``tink'' of aluminum
bats on balls, the cheering from the sidelines and the traffic on
Beavers Road from parents and friends and more players have
prompted the township and several neighbors to sue for the removal
of the ball field and the gymnasium and for the return of
Ingraham's 6.4-acre property to the kind of polished naturalness
that people around here apparently favor.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DeSerio grumbled with rueful humor, ``If this was happening
in Christie's backyard I doubt very much that anything would have
gotten this far.''
</P>
<P>
   She and three neighbors _ Dr. Elliott Rosen, a retired Rutgers
University history professor, and James and Diane Kudless, the
Ingrahams' nearest neighbors _ have joined Tewksbury Township's
suit to have Ingraham's field bulldozed. It is true, as Ingraham
emphasizes, that Tewksbury _ one of the wealthiest towns in New
Jersey, with a median family of $95,000 _ has miles of horse trails
but no Little League fields, Ms. DeSerio said. But the town has
bought land for ball fields, and if Ingraham cared to, Ms. DeSerio
said, he could get involved in the effort to create those fields.
</P>
<P>
   Town officials did not respond to repeated phone messages
requesting comment, leaving the town's lawyer in this case, Joseph
Murray of Berkeley Heights, to speak for them. The township granted
a building permit for Ingraham's gymnasium, but he did not seek a
permit for the ball field, Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   In its lawsuit, the town contends that using the field for
baseball games violates the ``auxiliary use'' provisions of the
town zoning laws, because baseball is played with a minimum of 18
players, plus officials and coaches. The laws' provisions, the town
contends, are intended to allow things like tennis courts, swimming
pools and horse corrals, which involve fewer people.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman, who lives on a 222-acre farm that lies partly in
Tewksbury several miles from the Ingrahams' field, has been in
Mexico recently and has not commented on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Ingraham admits that he made mistakes when he and his family
moved to Tewksbury three years ago. He had hoped to create a
baseball camp for grown-ups and children, but has given up on that
idea because of opposition in this town of about 5,200 people.
Since the neighbors first complained about the ball field _ not to
him, he maintains, only to town officials and to lawyers _ he has
agreed, in court, to some restrictions, pending the outcome of the
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   For now, no ball games are played on the diamond, which is used
only for batting and fielding practice. He has accepted a limit of
four children under the age of 13 on the field at a time, the use
of wood bats only _ the sound of baseballs striking aluminum
bothered Rosen, his lawyer said _ no cheerleaders, no Sunday play
and no more than two adults, in addition to Ingraham, on the field.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the restrictions, Ingraham thinks he has the lore and
logic of baseball on his side.
</P>
<P>
   He stood in the slanting autumn sunlight the other day and
watched his son's private coach, a Boston Red Sox minor leaguer
named Bob Slomski, put Brian and several other boys through batting
practice. ``I made mistakes,'' Ingraham said, ``but I never told
them I was going to stop playing baseball, because that's my thing.
Their thing is tennis, my thing is baseball.'' He said that
baseball is part of every boy's childhood and should not be
interfered with.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Matters of style obviously count around here. In an atmosphere
of restrained good taste, Ingraham has the manner of a man who
would not be above kicking a little dirt on the shoes of any umpire
who didn't like his style. In a town that reeks of old money,
Ingraham's shipping-label money is so new that the ink on it might
as well still be wet, and he thinks his unvarnished quality has
made people turn on him. More than six feet tall, heavy-set with a
barrel chest and an emphatic way of speaking, he also thinks that
his love of team sports has rubbed people here the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to just grudges, because I don't fit in with
these people and their way of life,'' Ingraham said. ``I could come
in here with 10 horses and ride around sitting on a horse all day
and they wouldn't say a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DeSerio, Rosen and township officials say Ingraham can be
hard to take: The suit describes him as ``a bully'' and says he has
``a reputation for being potentially violent'' and is ``physically
threatening in size and demeanor.'' The suit contends that Ingraham
abused Rosen over the telephone, an allegation Ingraham denies.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the neighbors disapprove of the ball field.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Hannigan, former executive director of the U.S. Golf
Association and a contributor to Golf Digest magazine, said the
sounds from the Ingraham backyard are the sounds of his youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I can hear it _ it sounds like kids playing ball, like
we played when I was a kid,'' Hannigan said. ``I don't live as
close as some of the others do, and maybe if I lived where Kathy
DeSerio lives I would feel differently. But as long as it isn't a
commercial operation it doesn't bother me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DeSerio is aware that suing a man for building a baseball
field is a little like refusing to salute the flag. And she has
borne the burden of defending the neighbors' point of view alone,
since her fellow plaintiffs have refused to discuss the rhubarb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understood when I went into this that I would subject myself
to a lot of ridicule,'' she said. ``They have made the point that I
don't have children, but that doesn't mean that I don't love
children. They say we're snobs. We aren't. We just think he is
trying to bring a baseball camp in here, and he isn't going to stop
trying unless we fight back.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray, the town's lawyer, said he did not know how much the
township and the neighbors have spent on the case so far. ``More
than they can afford,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ingraham's lawyer, Terence Scott, estimated that both sides had
spent more than $30,000 in legal costs so far, with the Dec. 14
trial date still more than two months away.
</P>
<P>
   Ingraham, after spending more than $350,000 on the ball field
and gymnasium, said that if he could only win permission for Sunday
play, he would be satisfied with the way things are, all the other
restrictions included. But give up the field entirely?
</P>
<P>
   ``If we lose in December we're going to appeal,'' he said, ``and
I assume they're going to let us keep playing while we appeal it.
If they try to stop us, they're going to have to drag me off that
field in handcuffs.''

RALLYING TO INCREASE AID FOR CANCER RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Thousands of people who have cancer, who have
overcome it, who have lost friends and relatives to the disease or
are working in laboratories to conquer it marched in the nation's
capital Saturday to seek more money for research.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers called it the first time that all the major cancer
organizations have rallied together, summoning people to the
National Mall for a daylong series of speeches, memorial events,
educational sessions and other efforts to mobilize support for the
war on cancer, which kills about a half-million Americans each
year. One in four deaths in the United States is from cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Bill and Terri Tomoff of Crofton, Md., arrived at the rally
pulling a little red wagon. In it sat their 6-year-old daughter,
Olivia, and 4-year-old son, Ryan, whose leukemia was diagnosed two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll live the rest of our lives fighting cancer,'' Mrs.
Tomoff said. Her husband said doctors at Georgetown University
Medical Center here, where Ryan is being treated, tell them that
three-quarters of children with leukemia survive, but often with
complications from therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This rally should raise awareness of the need for funding,''
Mrs. Tomoff said. ``They are on the brink of so many new things.''
</P>
<P>
   Haruo Tsuchiya, a researcher in cancer immuno-therapy in the
oncology department at the Johns Hopkins University School of
Medicine, took his wife and children to the rally, he said,
``because it's my job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People do not realize the importance of cancer research,''
Tsuchiya said. ``They know, but they don't feel seriously about it.
This is a kind of advertisement.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the rally's sponsors have called for doubling and
redoubling federal financing for cancer research, to a level of $10
billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer spending is now about $2.4 billion a year, and the House
and Senate budgets call for increases of 16 percent and 20 percent,
respectively, next year.
</P>
<P>
   The National Cancer Institute estimates that cancer costs the
nation $107 billion, including $37 billion in direct medical costs,
$59 billion to care for terminally ill patients and $11 billion in
lost productivity.
</P>
<P>
   At noon, the ralliers heard from Vice President Al Gore, the
Rev. Jesse Jackson and two survivors of prostate cancer, Gen.
Norman Schwarzkopf and financier Michael Milken, whose family
foundation helped pay for the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be the generation that wins the war on cancer,''
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   In his weekly radio address Saturday, President Clinton, noting
that his mother died of cancer, urged Congress to increase
financing for research over the next five years by 65 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The White House also introduced an assortment of new anti-cancer
initiatives, including a proposal by the cancer institute to let
patients participate in reviewing research grant proposals and
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also directed the institute to make it easier for
patients to participate in trials of new cancer treatments, and
called on Congress to cover the costs through Medicare.

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Brushing aside a veto threat from President
Clinton, the House passed an $80 billion Republican tax cut
Saturday that would be paid for by projected federal budget
surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   The vote put Republicans a step closer to a politically charged
election-year showdown with the White House and congressional
Democrats over an issue that both sides believe will play to their
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said a portion of the excess revenue expected to
flow to the government in coming years should be returned to
taxpayers, in part to keep Washington from spending it.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Clinton, Democrats have framed the issue as one of fiscal
responsibility, saying that to spend any surpluses before they
materialize would be reckless and endanger efforts to address the
Social Security system's long-term financial problems. Since
January, Clinton has been demanding that Congress set aside every
penny of the surplus until it has agreed with the administration on
a plan to shore up Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would provide a tax break for many middle-income
married couples, exempt some interest and dividend payments from
taxation, reduce inheritance taxes, accelerate a plan to allow the
self-employed to deduct 100 percent of their health insurance
premiums and extend a credit for research undertaken by
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's House vote, 229-195, was largely along party lines.
Eleven Republicans voted against the bill and 19 Democrats voted
for it.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation now goes to the Senate, where its prospects are
uncertain. Because of the parliamentary rules that will apply to
the bill in the Senate, it will require 60 votes for passage, a
hurdle that Republicans, who hold 55 seats, said would be difficult
to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans, who earlier this year voted to cut taxes $30
billion over five years, could scale back the House bill to try to
win votes from wavering Democrats, although no decision has yet
been made. Some Republicans have also weighed attaching the tax
bill to a package of spending bills to make it more difficult for
Democrats to vote against it and to raise the stakes should it come
to a presidential veto.
</P>
<P>
   Battered and strained by Clinton's struggle for political
survival, Democrats were clearly happy to turn attention to an
issue that could help unify the party and spur more Democrats to
turn out at the polls in November.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, traveling in California, immediately put out a
statement saying that the Republican plan ``drains billions of
dollars from the surplus before we have done the hard work of
strengthening Social Security.'' The president reiterated that he
would veto the bill if it reached his desk.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said the tax burden on citizens, measured as a
percentage of total economic activity, was at its highest level
since World War II. They said that cutting taxes would help move
power out of Washington and back to states and communities while
reining in Washington's predilection for ever-larger spending on
social programs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has already broken his own pledge to put Social Security
first by proposing to use the surplus to pay for emergency spending
next year for farm relief, increased security at American embassies
and the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, Republicans said. Moreover,
they said, the projected federal budget surpluses are so large that
there is plenty of room for a tax cut without limiting the options
for dealing with the looming crisis in Social Security, which will
run short of money to pay benefits when the baby-boom generation
retires over the next three decades.
</P>
<P>
   They said their plan would leave most of the surplus _ projected
by the Congressional Budget Office to be $520 billion over the next
five years and $1.55 trillion over the next 10 years _ free to help
address Social Security's looming difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has come to admit tax-and-spend has failed,'' said
Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, who wrote the tax bill. ``It's time to
reduce the size of government and to let people keep their tax
dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   But most Democrats stuck closely to their party line that now is
not the time for tax cuts. They said that all the projected surplus
for the next five years, and nearly all for the next decade, will
come from excess payroll tax payments that are earmarked for Social
Security's trust funds.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Social Security surplus is stripped out of the overall
surplus calculations, the Democrats said, there is nothing left to
pay for a tax cut, making the Republican plan a threat to the
nation's long-term fiscal health.
</P>
<P>
   ``The passage of this bill will make solving the Social Security
problem more difficult, plain and simple,'' said Rep. Benjamin
Cardin, D-Md. ``We're raiding Social Security. Without Social
Security we have no surplus.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The issue is already showing up in congressional races around
the country. The AFL-CIO, a major source of support for Democrats
as they struggle to keep Republicans from picking up more seats in
the wake of Clinton's troubles, said it began running television
commercials in 20 congressional districts last week trying to rally
support against the tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The commercials show a middle-aged couple paying their bills and
talking about retirement. It ends by urging voters and their
elected representatives to oppose ``this tax scheme'' and ``put
Social Security first.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader, said the
message from Republicans was that the ``election is more important
to the Republican Party than saving Social Security for future
generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said Democrats were relying on scare tactics.
``Social Security will be protected,'' said Rep. Sam Johnson,
R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Although the bill has provisions to benefit big business and the
wealthy, its was written by Republicans to appeal to the middle
class, and many Democrats said they would have supported it if it
did not require dipping into the surplus. The cuts would be worth
about $80 billion over five years and $177 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans ``have hijacked Democratic tax cut ideas and then
made it impossible for us to vote for them because their bill
drains the Social Security trust fund,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel,
D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's centerpiece is a reduction in the so-called marriage
penalty, the quirk in the tax code that causes many two-income
couples to pay a bigger tax bill than they would if single.
</P>
<P>
   The penalty primarily affects couples in which the two partners
have roughly equal incomes. But the bill would provide a break to
all couples who file jointly and claim the standard deduction by
increasing the standard deduction for couples filing jointly so
that it is double the deduction for single filers.
</P>
<P>
   The second-biggest provision in the bill would be an
acceleration of a planned reduction in the estate tax, a change
that would benefit the heirs of individuals who have amassed
considerable wealth. The provision would increase to $1 million
from $600,000 the amount that can be exempted from federal estate
taxes, starting Jan. 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also exempt from taxation the first $400 in
interest and dividend income for couples filing jointly, or $200
for single filers.

ARMSTRONG IS PEDALING BACK UP THE LADDER 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By SAMUEL ABT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Lance Armstrong has a new philosophy _ finish what you
start _ and, he reports happily, it's working like a charm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armstrong's the man of the year,'' said a longtime rival,
Laurent Jalabert, the Frenchman who ranks first among the world's
professional bicycle racers. After Armstrong finished sixth among
169 riders in a time trial two weeks ago, Jalabert added, ``He's
come back from so far down that you can't help but admire him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased so far,'' Armstrong said on the phone from Spain,
where, somewhat to his surprise, he ranked No. 4 over all in the
extremely demanding three-week Vuelta a Espana or Tour of Spain,
surging from ninth place with a third-place finish Saturday in the
same time as the stage winner, Alex Zuelle. The race ends Sunday in
Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing pretty good and I feel very good,'' he said. ``I've
been pleased and surprised at the way it's gone _ the climbs and
the time trials both.
</P>
<P>
   ``After two weeks of a big tour, I've never been top 10 before.
I've never been in the front group in big climbs, so for me it's
definitely been a success.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, who turned 27 on Sept. 18, has come a long way in
this comeback season after a year away from the sport while he was
recuperating from testicular cancer, which spread to his lungs and
brain. After months of chemotherapy in late 1996, his cancer is in
remission and he said he feels fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be here if I didn't,'' he said. His next checkup is
scheduled in a few weeks, probably in Europe after his major goal
of the season, the world championship road race in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been quite amazing,'' said Johnny Weltz, Armstrong's
coach with the U.S. Postal Service team. ``He's better now than he
was before he got sick. In this race you've got most of the best
climbers in the world. So if you're up there with them after two
weeks of racing, it's because you're climbing very well yourself.
It's amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong brushed off speculation that he had planned to use the
Vuelta as a training race for the world championship, and would
drop out after two of the three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always planning on doing the full three weeks,'' he
insisted. ``After I came back to Europe in July, that was the only
goal I set for myself: to finish every race I entered.'' He has,
too, from a fourth place in the Tour of Holland to results back in
the pack in the August one-day classics.
</P>
<P>
   His new determination can be traced to the Paris-Nice race in
March, where he dropped out on the first road stage after leading a
long chase in cold and rainy weather. While Armstrong has not
publicly explained his reasons for withdrawing and heading home to
Austin, Texas, he did some soul-searching before he returned to
Europe in June and won the Tour of Luxembourg and a minor race in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the advice of his doctors, he did not compete in the Tour
de France in July but continued training in the United States,
where he won the Cascade Classic and rode a strong support race to
help a teammate, George Hincapie, finish first in the United States
professional championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Paris-Nice, I really felt that I left a quitter, and I
didn't like that feeling,'' Armstrong said from Spain. ``So I said
to myself, `I can't put any pressure on myself to perform, but I
have to finish.'
</P>
<P>
   ``My approach to the bike now and the whole sport is that I try
to relax instead of worrying. It's better that way. In the spring I
was so serious, so concerned about the comeback _ whether or not it
was going to work and whether or not it would be considered a
success _ I think it got to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``And now I just train hard and focus on the other things that
you have to do and race hard. That formula seems to be working.
It's a long season. I said to myself, `If I come back, I have
plenty of time to get results,' and that's where we are now.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong has signed to race again next year for U.S. Postal
Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm comfortable with this group,'' he said. ``It doesn't have
a lot of internal pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise he is looking ahead only to his honeymoon, probably in
the Caribbean in late fall. It was delayed by his race schedule
after his marriage to Kristin Richard in May.
</P>
<P>
   His remaining races before the season ends in late October
include the Paris-Tours classic, the Tour of Lombardy and
especially the world championship in Valkenburg, the Netherlands,
on Oct. 11. The course, including 17 climbs of the tiring Cauberg
hill, is considered to be tailored for strong riders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard it's a good course for me,'' he said, ``but I
really don't know what's good for me or not. I've seen it. The
Cauberg is a pretty awesome climb _ doing it 17 times will be
tough. But I plan to be there and plan to finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've finished two world championships. One of them I won and
the other I was seventh. I'm always in the thick of it when I
finish.'' &QL;

FLORIDA KEYS REVIVED AFTER DESTRUCTIVE NIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also HURRICANE-CARIB.)

<P>
   KEY WEST, Fla. _ Thousands of residents woke to a sultry sea
breeze and a giant mess Saturday after Hurricane Georges blasted
the southern half of the Florida Keys on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of homes were destroyed, and half a dozen yachts were
sunk during 18 hours of winds up to 100 miles an hour, but no one
was reported killed or seriously injured. Countless trees were
uprooted, power lines were toppled and roofs ripped apart, but by
Saturday afternoon power was returning in zones throughout the
string of low islands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're alive,'' said Kelly DeFore, who weathered the winds and
six-foot surge of ocean water inside a used Greyhound bus parked on
an oceanside dock on Cudjoe Key. The bus began to float at dusk
Friday when winds were their strongest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt like we were in a sail boat,'' she said. Ms. DeFore
and her partner, Michael Horn, lost everything they owned.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. 1, the sole highway that connects Key West to Florida's
mainland, along a long string of low-lying islands and bridges, was
being reopened in stages. It was covered with five feet of water in
places during the storm, and property ranging from sofas to hot
tubs to motorboats floated onto and blocked the road.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 30,000 people who evacuated early in the week were
expected to return over the next few days. Full power restoration
could take a week. A curfew remained in effect in downtown Key West
after looting was reported, but many residents were out walking,
driving and cleaning up. The National Guard and state troopers were
brought in.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe County officials attributed the low casualty rate to the
fact that the hurricane did not cross the Keys with full force, and
that tides were moderate, reducing the surge of seawater that comes
after the eye has passed.
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimate that half the island residents heeded
evacuation orders, leaving 35,000 throughout the Keys and 12,000 in
Key West.
</P>
<P>
   The areas of the Keys that were hit the hardest appeared in the
50-mile stretch between Marathon and Key West. The hurricane's eye
brushed the southern coasts of the islands, and the fierce
counter-clockwise winds coming from the east and south did most of
the damage. Waterfront homes and trailers that faced the Florida
Straits were beaten by both waves and winds.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DeFore and Horn said everything they owned was now piled in
the mangroves. Parts of their 90-foot reinforced dock were on U.S.
1. Their boats floated away in the storm.
</P>
<P>
   In Key West, the picturesque Houseboat Row, a collection of
floating homes and rental units, was largely destroyed. The row has
been the focus of a contentious battle between state and local
officials over the lack of sewage treatment. Many in Key West
wanted the row to remain, but the question may have been resolved
by the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``They probably won't replace the power and cable,'' said Kevin
Boswell, a 16-year resident who surveyed a floating pile of foam,
furniture and walls in the shallow water along the island seawall.
</P>
<P>
   Around the corner, near the Key West Airport, Joe Hanlin was
sitting in his 22-foot sailboat that came to rest high and dry on
the grounds of a Best Western motel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call the boat the Wayward Wind,'' he laughed. ``Next time,
I'm going to high-tail it out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   On the ocean side of Cudjoe Key, 22 miles from Key West, a group
of nine trailer-court renters wandered around their piles of trash
in a collective daze.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just moved here last month from Philadelphia,'' said Mike
Devlin. Their trailer, full of new furniture, television sets and
appliances, was in ruins. ``I start work Monday at a new job _ if
it's still there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Dean, a neighbor, said he watched from his trailer while
the water rose to cover his $18,000 Harley Davidson motorcycle,
then he went out and sat on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If God was going to take my Harley, I was going to go with
it,'' he said.

PUBLIC FACE OF TERROR SUSPECT: LOW-KEY FAMILY MAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By RAYMOND BONNER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ His business card said he was the director of
Africa Help, a nongovernmental relief organization, and he told
friends that he supplemented his income by trading in precious
stones. He lived unspectacularly in a close-knit middle-class
housing development. A father of six, he sent the oldest to a
primary school, where his wife was active in the Parent Teachers
Association.
</P>
<P>
   That was the public face here of Wahid el Hage, a U.S.-educated
urban planner who said he once worked for the cities of Tuscon,
Ariz., and Dallas, and whose American wife yearned for her native
land.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the public eye, according to recent federal indictments,
el Hage was a leader in the Kenyan branch of a terrorist
organization, Al Qaeda, which is run by Osama bin Laden, the man
believed to be the mastermind of last month's bombings of the U.S.
embassy here and in neighboring Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   El Hage has not been charged in connection with the bombings,
but he has been indicted on multiple counts of lying about his
relationship to members of the bin Laden organization. On Thursday,
he pleaded not guilty in federal district court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   As the investigation into the bombing unfolds, it emerges that
the face of terrorism in the 1990s is not that of a young,
unemployed firebrand. Rather it is a middle-class family man, well
integrated into the community. While plotting terrorist actions
against the United States, the perpetrators have jobs, even if they
are covers, sign contracts, live in good neighborhoods, marry and
have children while covertly plotting terrorist actions against the
United States, according to the indictments.
</P>
<P>
   One of el Hage's top aides was Haroun Fazil, who wrote reports
directly to bin Laden while living with el Hage, according to the
indictments. A few weeks before the bombing, Fazil, who taught el
Hage's children the Koran, moved with his wife, two small children
and ailing father-in-law into their own place, a modern, two-story
house on a half-acre lot in a suburb on the north side of Nairobi.
It was there that the bomb was partly assembled, according to the
indictments.
</P>
<P>
   The Fazil family kept to themselves. No one suspected anything.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Fazil and el Hage went to a wedding in the coastal city
of Mombasa. The bride was a Kenyan woman. The groom was a
commercial fisherman, Mohamed Saddiq Odeh. He had also moved to
Kenya in 1994, the same year as el Hage, and had been set up in
business by Al Qaeda, and then returned the income to the terrorist
organization, according to the indictments. He is now in jail in
New York, charged in the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   After the ceremony, el Hage drove the bride and groom home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just an ordinary, quiet, middle-class person,'' a
family friend, Abdul-Aziz bin Franklin, said about el Hage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm almost 100 percent sure they were not involved, certainly
not his wife,'' said Nuru Abdul-Aziz, Franklin's Kenyan wife. When
there were television reports about terrorism, el Hage's wife, an
American whose maiden name is April Ray, expressed strenuous
disapproval of terrorism and Islamic militancy, Mrs. Abdul-Aziz
said.
</P>
<P>
   A convert to Islam, like her husband, Mrs. el Hage dressed from
head to toe in black, with only an opening for eyes, Mrs.
Abdul-Aziz said. She described her friend as a housewife who spent
a lot of time cooking Arabic food and was homesick for America.
``She talked about America like it was heaven,'' said Mrs.
Abdul-Aziz, who added that she did not know where Mrs. el Hage came
from in the United States.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. el Hage often gave clothes to Nairobi's street children,
Mrs. Abdul-Aziz said, even though the el Hage family was not _
ostensibly, anyway _ well-off.
</P>
<P>
   The two families met through their children, who were attending
the Nairobi Muslim Academy and were excited about the fact that
they had American fathers, Franklin said. Franklin, who was born in
Beasley, Ark., and graduated from UCLA with a degree in
bacteriology, immigrated to Kenya in 1979, and converted to Islam a
year later.
</P>
<P>
   According to papers he filed with the Kenyan government, el Hage
was born in Sidon, Lebanon, on July 25, 1960. When he came to the
United States is unknown. He attended the University of
Southwestern Louisiana from 1978 to 1986, receiving a bachelor's
degree in urban planning, the university said by telephone on
Friday. From 1987 to 1990, he worked as an urban planner for the
city of Tucson, and from 1990 to 1992 for the Dallas Planning
Committee, el Hage said in papers he filed with the Kenyan
government. On Friday, a spokesman for the Dallas planning office
said there was no record of el Hage having worked there. Officials
in Tucson said they could not immediately confirm el Hage's story.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, a federal prosecutor suggested that the government
had evidence that indirectly tied el Hage to a mysterious 1991
killing in Brooklyn _ and thus, potentially, to the blind Egyptian
cleric Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman and the circle of Islamic militants
convicted in connection with the 1993 bombing of the World Trade
Center.
</P>
<P>
   The victim, Mustapha Shalabi, had been Abdel-Rahman's sponsor
when he entered the United States and had also run an organization
that raised money and recruited volunteers for the rebels fighting
the Soviets in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   But the two split in 1991, when the Sheik demanded that half the
money be diverted from the now-victorious Afghans to be used
instead to overthrow President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. In March of
that year, Shalabi's body was discovered in his home in Seagate,
Brooklyn, beaten, shot and repeatedly stabbed.
</P>
<P>
   The assistant U.S. attorney, Patrick Fitzgerald, said at a
hearing at which el Hage was denied bail that el Hage had arrived
in New York about a week before Shalabi's body was found in order
to take over direction of the Alkifah refugee organization.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, el Hage was in Sudan, where he met bin Laden and became
his personal secretary, according to the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, el Hage and his family moved to Kenya. He signed
a one-year lease on house No. 1523 in Fedha Estates, an
``upper-working-class development,'' as a Fedha officer described
it, on drab, flat land east of downtown Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   The rent for the first year was 20,000 Kenyan shillings, payable
in quarterly installments, increased to 25,000 shillings the next
year, the equivalent of about $500 a month at today's exchange
rate.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the house, Abdi Ali Dere, recalled in an interview
that sometimes el Hage would be a month or two late with his rent.
Otherwise there was nothing about el Hage that made him stand out
from other tenants, Dere said.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin also thought his friend seemed to be struggling
financially, and he and his wife, in the Muslim tradition of
helping the less well-off, would often take the large el Hage
family chicken and other food. ``I kind of wondered how he was
managing financially,'' Franklin said.
</P>
<P>
   El Hage's business card said that he was the director of Africa
Help, a nongovernmental organization that was said to be engaged in
health and education projects in several Kenyan towns.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and Kenyan officials have said that some Muslim relief
agencies are fronts for terrorist operations, and after the bomb
blasts here, the Kenyan government ordered six nongovernmental
organizations to cease activities and expelled some of the leaders.
The organizations have challenged the order in court, except for
Africa Help, which also went by the name Help Africa People.
</P>
<P>
   In the registration papers el Hage filed with the Kenyan
government, el Hage said the organization's main office was in
Heidelberg, Germany. The German Embassy here said it had no
information about the organization. The Kenyan government had no
contacts for the organization other than el Hage.
</P>
<P>
   El Hage listed Aadil Habib as one of the organization's local
officers. During questioning by a grand jury looking into bin
Laden's activities, el Hage denied ever knowing Habib, according to
the indictment. The indictment says Habib, who was also known as
Abu Ubaidah al-Banshiri, was a military commander in the Al Qaeda
organization, and that he died in a ferry boat accident on Lake
Victoria in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   El Hage's friend in Nairobi, Franklin, did not know any of that,
nor have any reason to suspect el Hage.
</P>
<P>
   Until August a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   That was when the FBI came to el Hage's house here and
questioned him about his relationship to bin Laden. The agents took
his laptop computer, el Hage told Franklin.
</P>
<P>
   After the questioning, el Hage gave the landlord the required
month's notice, sold off some appliances, and left Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   ``He left in a hurry,'' said Franklin.

NEW YORKER HONES EPEE SKILLS WITH BEST COMPETITION HE CAN FIND 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By FRANK LITSKY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At 6 feet 4 inches and 180 pounds, with a neat Vandyke beard, a
ponytail, two earrings on his left ear and one on his right, Justin
Tausig looks like one of the Three Musketeers.
</P>
<P>
   The comparison is fitting because this 28-year-old native New
Yorker is an epee fencer who has lived the last five years in Paris
to better learn his craft.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be the best you can, you have to compete against the best
competition you can find,'' Tausig said during a recent vacation in
New York. ``In basketball, that would be the NBA. In fencing, you
have to go to Europe, to Germany, Italy, France or Hungary. France
has the depth in epee and a training system that gives them
depth.''
</P>
<P>
   Tausig will be a member of the U.S. team at the 1998 world
championships Oct. 5-11 in Chaux de Fonds, Switzerland. He joins
two other New Yorkers, Jon Normile, a three-time national champion
and 1992 Olympian, and Ben Atkins, a two-time national champion, on
the men's epee team, as well as Weston Kelsey of Brush Prairie,
Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Tausig (the first syllable rhymes with ``now'') went to a
college rich in fencing tradition, New York University, and
graduated in 1993 with a degree in archeology. He now ranks third
among Americans in epee and considers himself among the top 70 in
the world. On the French circuit in January, he finished fifth, a
creditable showing for the only amateur there.
</P>
<P>
   By modern standards, he is certainly an amateur. He says he
receives a grant of about $2,000 a year from the U.S. Fencing
Association, the national governing body, and a similar grant from
the U.S. Olympic Committee. He gets energy bars and T-shirts from
PowerBar and the remaining support from his parents. He pays for
much of his travel in frequent-flier miles.
</P>
<P>
   As for his personality, Tausig acknowledges he can be hard for
some to take. ``I think I provoke a strong reaction in people,'' he
said. ``You love me or you hate me. I'm very passionate about the
things I do. I can be somewhat off-putting or intimidating. I
certainly don't mean to be, but any reaction to me in the U.S. is
amplified in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   That does not derail him at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a quick-fix sport,'' he said. ``There's such a
demand for experience. The technical level of the sport is very
high. You may have a great attack or a great defense, but your
opponent is always trying to prevent you from using your strength.
I think I'm good, absolutely, but I want to be great. That's why
I'm training in France. It's the level of competition, the level of
training.''
</P>
<P>
   Fencing took over Tausig's life just before he turned 13. He
read a newspaper article about Giorgio Santelli, a 1920 Olympic
gold medalist and son of a fencing champion. He was so impressed
that he looked up Santelli and called him. Santelli said to drop
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``That day,'' Tausig said, ``he taught me the basics. He said,
`You're going to be my new student.' I don't take orders very well,
but I couldn't say no to him. I'm not a rebel or a nonconformist.
But I've always kind of gone my own way. I never did something
because everyone else was doing it or no one else was doing it. It
was just that I had to do it on my terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he was different. The next two years changed my life. He
never had a son who fenced competitively, and in his day fencing
was passed on from father to son. He took me into his family and
treated me as a son. He taught me not only about fencing, but about
life. If I hadn't met him, I can't imagine what I'd be today.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 15, he died. To this day. I'm proud I was his last
student, that he had not only faith in me, but respect for me. When
you're that age, you don't have a lot of belief in yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Tausig said his immediate goal was to compete in the 2000
Olympics. ``Then I figure to move back to the U.S.,'' he said.
``I'm not sure what I would do. I could be in a swashbuckling
movie. Maybe I could coach a little. And I'd like to write. I'm
writing a murder mystery set in Paris. It will be a great movie. I
love writing because it gives me a way to express myself and be
creative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fencing does that, too, but within the restrictions of a
sport. If I just fenced, maybe I could create more, but you can't
do just one thing. At least I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Tausig hopes to convince Americans that fencing is a major
league sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans aren't good in fencing because it's not part of our
culture,'' he said. ``It's a relatively obscure sport in the U.S.
You tell Americans you're in fencing and they think you're selling
watches in Times Square.''

EFFICIENT TESTAVERDE FINDS `RIGHT SPOT' FOR JETS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Fla.)  (bl) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vinny Testaverde is surrounded by the trappings of his youth,
when he could steamroller Sewanhaka High to victory by force of
will. But now, at age 34, playing for the team whose legendary
quarterback's picture used to adorn his bedroom wall, Testaverde is
happy being a smart veteran _ and just being happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I loved about last week,'' he said, ``is that from the
first snap of practice till the game started, I enjoyed it. I
allowed myself to enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, he still longs for the downfield bomb, even after four
touchdown passes in his New York Jets debut last Sunday, a 44-6
victory against the Colts. But he is not even sure whether he will
be the quarterback again next Sunday when the Jets return from a
bye week to face the Miami Dolphins. Glenn Foley is the designated
starter, and if he is healthy enough following a rib injury, he
will take on Miami in what could be a pivotal game.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde has also demonstrated something else in his week of
leading the team: pride. He talks reluctantly about himself. He has
never even been one to celebrate unduly when things were going
right _ he always worried that his fortunes could change. For him,
they often did. It has been a career of many lows, including his
first six years at Tampa Bay, and then a Pro Bowl selection two
years ago with Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, people were saying, `Some of those touchdown passes
didn't go very far,''' said Testaverde as he reflected on his
performance last week. He joked that Leon Johnson's 82-yard catch
and run started with a pass ``that only went 3 yards.''
</P>
<P>
   But Testaverde said, ``I got it to him in the right spot, and
put him in position to run.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to get it to the players in stride,''
Testaverde continued. ``Sometimes it sounds easy and it looks
easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, Wayne Chrebet's little 8-yard score off a
pass, most of it a run, half of that a dive over the goal-line
marker.
</P>
<P>
   ``See, I led him, so he could catch it in stride and make
something happen once he got it. It wasn't behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   There was also a 1-yard lob to Kyle Brady, who was alone in the
end zone.
</P>
<P>
   What Testaverde really was proud of, though _ and coach Bill
Parcells thought was his best play _ was standing in the pocket and
checking off his receivers on Keyshawn Johnson's 11-yard touchdown.
One receiver was covered, then another, then another. As Testaverde
waited, the pressure from the pass rush increased.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to move to my right when the pressure started,'' said
Testaverde. ``Then I hit Keyshawn. He wasn't my primary receiver.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't tell Keyshawn that,'' quipped Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   There was something else about that day's performance, in which
Testaverde completed 12 of 21 passes for 203 yards, that Parcells
loved.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first fumble recovery; that was a big play,'' Parcells
said.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde pounced on a fumble by Curtis Martin, and prevented a
momentum shift on the Jets' opening series. Instead, one play later
Testaverde tossed his touchdown pass to Leon Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde played a smart, efficient game. These are not
adjectives that always tripped lightly off the tongue in describing
the 6-foot 5-inch, 238-pounder. Big plays and bad plays always
seemed to be in equal measure. Also, his size tends to make
observers think of him as a big-play sort of guy. He doesn't exude
subtlety.
</P>
<P>
   He does, however, have a stomach that used to churn incessantly
_ despite his heroic stature at Sewanhaka, in Elmont, N.Y., a long
pass from the Jets' training complex; or his Heisman Trophy season
at Miami, or his selection as the league's overall No. 1 draft pick
of 1987 by Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things Coach Marchibroda told me; as hard as I
worked at the game, I needed to enjoy it more,'' Testaverde said of
his epiphany two years ago when he played for the Ravens under Ted
Marchibroda.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would see how I would get down on myself for a bad play,''
Testaverde said. ``Now I'm trying to be as happy after a good play
as unhappy after a bad play.''
</P>
<P>
   In his two seasons under Marchibroda, and his big game with the
Jets, Testaverde's touchdowns-to-interceptions figures have
improved dramatically _ he has tossed 55 touchdowns to only 35
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want it to be my regret _ that I'll retire one day and
look back and say I should have enjoyed the game,'' said
Testaverde.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe even his father, Al, is learning how to enjoy watching his
son. Ten years ago, Al Testaverde went to a game in Tampa to watch
Vinny. Al got a heart attack. He is usually so stressed when Vinny
plays that he decided after that not he would not even watch his
son on television.
</P>
<P>
   But he watched last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a little bit,'' said Vinny. ``If I wasn't playing for the
Jets, he probably wouldn't have watched.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps it's a start after all these years, for father and
son.

IRONMAN TRIATHLON GROWS; IT'S NOW 20 AND STILL BRAGGING 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   On that February morning in 1978, only 15 sets of footprints
dotted the shores of Waikiki. To every man fit and brave enough to
take the challenge went three sheets of paper listing a few rules
and a course description.
</P>
<P>
   Scrawled on the last sheet of paper were these words: ``Swim 2.4
miles! Bike 112 miles! Run 26.2 miles! Brag for the rest of your
life!''
</P>
<P>
   Then came a single gunshot, and the challenge was under way.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven hours 46 minutes 58 seconds later, Gordon Haller, a taxi
cab driver on most days, a local hero on that day, became the
world's first Ironman Triathlon champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't seem like such a big deal at the time,'' said the
former Navy commander John Collins, who created the Ironman and
placed ninth among the 12 finishers of the inaugural run. ``I mean,
I remember that first year before the race, we gave swimming
lessons to some of the guys from the back of a lifeguard boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years later, the Ironman Triathlon has emerged as one of
the most intriguing and recognizable sporting events in the United
States. Having grown in tandem with fitness-conscious America the
past two decades, the grueling spectacle now has a field 100 times
its original size.
</P>
<P>
   Next Saturday, nearly 1,500 triathletes from around the world,
ages 18-80, will sink their footprints on the shores of Kailu-Kona,
where the event is now held. The race will be televised in more
than 50 nations including Russia, South Africa, Japan, Korea and
Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of Saturday's competitors, aiming for a top prize
of $35,000, or all the personal satisfaction money can't buy,
earned their spots in qualifying races worldwide, leaving in their
dust almost 50,000 Ironman applicants who were turned away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not, `If I can do it', but, `How can I do it,''' said
55-year-old Leon Okurowski, a financial executive from Concord,
Mass., who flew to Hawaii three weeks before the race to get
acclimated to the course and train in the intense heat and windy
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to this race is knowing how to expend your energy,''
said Okurowski, who is using his appearance in the race to raise
money for the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston. ``What you need to
know most of all is how to temper your energy to the conditions of
the course.''
</P>
<P>
   Okurowski, who trains 12-18 hours per week, is one of 150
competitors who have joined the field via a lottery to insure that
average Joes are represented. In addition, some 20 celebrity
invitations are sent out to help promote the event.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, the celebrity list has included the Denver
Broncos' owner, Pat Bowlen; the former NFL players Butch Johnson
and Darryl Haley, the astronaut Bill Gregory; New Mexico Gov. Gary
Johnson; actress Alexandra Paul, and Benjamin Kendrick, the judge
who presided over the Marv Albert trial.
</P>
<P>
   For Saturday's anniversary race, the celebrities include Mike
Adamle, a former football standout at Northwestern University who
later played in the NFL and is now a sportscaster, and David
Bailey, the Michael Jordan of motocross racing in the 1980s who
became paralyzed in a racing accident and will compete in a
wheelchair along part of the course.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Collins, the man who created the Ironman race
after a dispute with some of his Navy buddies back in 1978. At the
time, Collins and company debated as to whether runners, swimmers
or cyclists were more fit. At an awards banquet that year, Collins
issued a challenge, proposing to tie together the three toughest
endurance races in Hawaii: the 2.4 mile Waikiki Roughwater Swim,
the 112-mile bike race around the island and a run of the Honolulu
Marathon course's 26.2 miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said the gun will go off about 7 a.m., the clock will keep
running, and whoever finishes first we'll call the Ironman,'' said
Collins, who named the race after an elderly long-distance runner
he and his running mates had nicknamed Ironman.
</P>
<P>
   In the next two years, a Sports Illustrated article describing
the Ironman and coverage of the event by ABC's ``Wide World of
Sports'' raised global interest in Collins' challenge, and
suddenly, a sport was born. Perhaps the most enduring moment of the
race came in February 1982, when Julie Moss collapsed as she headed
toward the finish line of a nationally televised race. Passed by
Kathleen McCartney for the women's title, Moss stole the hearts of
fans and competitors by crawling across the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, now 62, will run Saturday's race with his wife, Judy,
and their son, Michael.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone asks how I earned my spot in the race, tell them I
qualified back in 1978.'' said Collins. ``Hey, I finished ninth in
the world that year.''

USING `LIBERAL' AS EPITHET MAY FAIL D'AMATO THIS TIME 
</HEADLINE>
  (DUPLICATION WARNING: Also moving in ``p'' news file.) 
(bl) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the very first sentence of a commercial that he
unveiled on the very first day of his general-election campaign,
Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato signaled his plan of attack on his
Democratic challenger, Rep. Charles Schumer. To anyone who had
followed D'Amato's previous campaigns, or the candidacies of a
dozen Republicans across the nation who read from the same
strategic playbook, it was anything but a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuck Schumer's a New York City liberal, and he proves it
every day,'' the announcer proclaims, as the word ``liberal,'' in
bold block letters, rolls across the screen. Since then, virtually
every campaign statement, television advertisement and speech by
D'Amato that mentions Schumer has been larded with the word.
</P>
<P>
   In casting the race in such ideological terms, and using a word
that is so loaded with often negative political imagery,
particularly in upstate New York, D'Amato and his chief political
adviser, Arthur Finkelstein, have reprised a strategy that helped
the Republicans become the majority party in Congress in 1994 and
led to the re-election of D'Amato in 1992 and the election of Gov.
George Pataki in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But many political analysts believe that it is a strategy that
has lost its bite. In 1996, a half-dozen of Finkelstein's clients
who used variations on the liberal theme lost their elections. This
year, D'Amato is the only major Republican running nationally to
have, so far, built a campaign on attacking an opponent as liberal,
according to Charles Cook, the editor of the Cook Political Report,
which monitors congressional campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general feeling is that this has sort of run its course,''
Cook said. ``It's doesn't work so much anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., who withstood a challenge in 1996
directed by Finkelstein that characterized him as liberal, said the
line of attack has ``just become tiresome to people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems hackneyed and it seems like the same old poison
politics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, it seems fitting that the strategy that
Finkelstein and D'Amato employed so successfully in the 1990's
should be getting one more, perhaps final, test in New York. It was
D'Amato's defeat of Robert Abrams in 1992 and Pataki's defeat of
Gov. Mario Cuomo in 1994 _ both in campaigns that demonized
liberalism _ that led many politicians to conclude that liberalism
was no longer the powerful ideological and political force it once
was in one of the nation's most liberal states.
</P>
<P>
   Yet New York, or at least this New York race, would seem
particularly ill suited for this kind of attack. And in Schumer,
D'Amato is facing an opponent who has closely studied D'Amato's
political style. In Congress, he cast a series of strategic votes _
restricting illegal immigrants, favoring a federal death penalty,
deregulating banks and the securities industry _ that, apart from
presumably reflecting Schumer's genuine beliefs, were calculated to
deflect Republicans' efforts to categorize him as a liberal.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, many analysts say, D'Amato will find it more difficult to
present Schumer in stark ideological terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will lose in New York,'' said Robert Shrum, the
Washington Democratic consultant who worked for one of Schumer's
rivals for the Democratic nomination, Geraldine Ferraro. ``If
Schumer is out there arguing real issues, and D'Amato is saying,
`Liberal, liberal, liberal,' we're going to start saying Senator
Schumer. People are not buying these labels.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato and his advisers strenuously disputed that argument,
asserting that the tactic continued to enjoy political potency _
especially outside Manhattan _ and that Schumer was another in a
long line of liberal candidates nominated by the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never heard anything so silly,'' said D'Amato, who
championed this approach in contests across the nation when he was
chairman of the Senate Republicans' campaign committee in 1995 and
1996. ``Somebody who is running on the Liberal Party line. Somebody
who has proclaimed themselves as liberal over the years. Someone
whose votes opposing welfare reform, opposing workfare, opposing
mandatory sentences for violent criminals. Why don't you write that
down?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you ask him why he calls me a conservative, a
right-winger?'' D'Amato continued. ``To suggest that somehow this
is some terrible offense to characterize him as a liberal is
preposterous.''
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of demographics, the number of New York voters who
identify themselves to pollsters as liberal _ about 22 percent _
has remained essentially unchanged in surveys and exit polls taken
since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   But in truth, political strategists say, the constant use of the
word liberal by D'Amato has to do with more than ideology. It is
also intended to reinforce D'Amato's strategy of turning upstate
voters, who as a rule are more conservative than voters in New York
City, against Schumer. In that regard, the word ``liberal'' is
meant to conjure up a series of urban images that D'Amato's
advisers say are alien to the rural and suburban stretches of
upstate: crime, government spending, welfare, ethnic diversity and
public disorder.
</P>
<P>
   And it seems likely to play to what Schumer's own advisers have
worried is a liability for the congressman among many voters north
of New York: the fact that he is a Jewish politician from Brooklyn,
making him very different from the people whose votes he is trying
to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people wonder whether being Jewish from New York City
makes it more difficult to pull upstate votes,'' Cook said. ``And
to the extent that you're talking about a New Yorker being liberal,
liberal, liberal, that's an inference you can draw. I think it's
something nobody is talking about, but everybody is thinking
about.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's aides said they were playing to the state geographic
rivalries, and had no intention of stoking ethnic or religious
divisions in the state. Indeed, D'Amato has long been known as a
champion of Israel, and most recently has led the fight to recover
assets of Holocaust survivors that were held in Swiss banks. Polls
have shown him to be extremely popular among Jewish voters.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 20 years, Republicans have used the ``liberal'' label
to undermine Democrats, forcing them to chose between the historic
base of their party and the evolving segment of blue-collar and
middle-class voters who have come to decide elections.
</P>
<P>
   It was Bill Clinton who first began to construct a defense
against those charges in 1992, in a strategy that Schumer has
appropriated: identifying himself with issues that play against
type. D'Amato has tried to counter that by picking votes from the
early years of Schumer's career, before liberalism fell into
disfavor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuck Schumer's record is just crying for conversation,'' said
Kieran Mahoney, one of D'Amato's senior political advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are signs that times are changing. John Zogby, the
Syracuse-based pollster, contends that the specter of liberalism in
New York has been replaced by the specter of House Speaker Newt
Gingrich. ``The Contract With America and the Republican Revolution
gave most New Yorkers something to be more fearful of than
liberalism,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If Zogby is correct, D'Amato is in for a difficult six weeks.
And that is the view of a well-known Democrat who is now working as
a lawyer in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing they have going for them is the cheap labels,''
Mario Cuomo said. ``But they're all four years old. This isn't
1994.''

EDITORIAL: TO DEAL OR TO FIGHT? 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Sept. 27:
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by public impatience with the Monica Lewinsky case,
some of Bill Clinton's aides have devised a political battle plan
they believe can save his presidency. It is essentially the same
strategy the White House used in earlier confrontations with the
Republican majority in Congress _ namely, paint the opposition as
parochial, partisan and indifferent to the national interest.
</P>
<P>
   These tactics have worked in budget and policy conflicts. But
when transferred to the legal arena by hatchet-swingers like James
Carville, Lanny Davis and the White House lawyers, such attacks
have steadily weakened personal respect for President Clinton, his
grip on his office and his negotiating options.
</P>
<P>
   We do not expect Clinton's scorched-earth advisers to quit
calling artillery fire into their own position. But Clinton and the
wiser counselors who are trying to get his ear may still turn to a
more productive approach. They want a settlement in which Clinton
remains in office, accepts a strong congressional reprimand and
gives up the untenable assertion that he did not lie under oath
before the federal grand jury and in the Paula Jones civil suit,
which Clinton is now belatedly trying to settle.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times editorial page has outlined such a resolution
before and we continue to see it as a potentially just outcome. It
was heartening to see the White House entertain a similar approach
last week, but the overture was blunted when Clinton and Hillary
Rodham Clinton assailed the Republicans in stridently partisan
appearances that did not help his cause in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that the Clinton camp sees assaults on Newt
Gingrich as the president's salvation. Almost every time the White
House has faced off with congressional Republicans, Gingrich has
led his followers to disadvantage or defeat by yielding the
political high ground to Clinton. Memories of his searing defeat in
the government shutdown and the polls showing that a majority of
Americans would like to see a quick resolution to the House
Judiciary Committee deliberations may cause Gingrich to overrule
Rep. Henry Hyde on extending the process until the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But try as it might, the White House cannot turn the Lewinsky
case into a referendum on Gingrich. The duly constituted machinery
of American government has brought before the House credible
evidence that may be grounds for impeachment. The duty of the House
is to review that evidence. But that process does not have to
inhibit serious negotiations between congressional leaders and
White House representatives who are willing to forswear
self-defeating attacks on people who are rightly appalled by
Clinton's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans are weary of the case, disturbed by Kenneth
Starr's microscopic examination of Clinton's sexual activities and
anxious to see Washington deal with pressing domestic and foreign
policy matters. Even so, a majority still believe some further
action is required, specifically either the initiation of
impeachment hearings or congressional censure of Clinton. The
appropriate White House response in such circumstances is to find
negotiators who can put Clinton in a position where he can fairly
argue that sanction short of impeachment and removal from office is
plausible and equitable.
</P>
<P>
   That requires not just remorse and repentance, but a willingness
to acknowledge that he lied under oath. Standing above the law is
not legally, constitutionally or politically viable. Just as
Clinton has in recent weeks set aside his belligerence about other
facets of the Lewinsky case, he must sooner or later drop the legal
and linguistic acrobatics about whether he had sexual relations
with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Only then can Congress and the White House engage in serious
discussions about a settlement that might include censure instead
of impeachment and the appearance of Clinton before the House to
address his misconduct. As part of such a deal, the Congress could
inoculate Clinton against criminal indictment when he leaves office
in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Clinton's friends, like former White House counsels
Lloyd Cutler and Abner Mikva, see the attraction of such a
settlement, and cooler heads at the White House seem to agree. To
achieve that goal they will have to restrain those who think this
is just another political battle to be directed from a war room
whose outmoded tactics have become a danger to the president.

 &HT;    CANCER DEMONSTRATION FOR PUBLIC AWARENESS _ AND DOLLARS
 &HT;    For immediate release. Resending for those who need it.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As cancer survivors participated this weekend in
``the March,'' a nationwide demonstration against the disease,
organizers of the affair had their eyes on more than $14 billion
the government spends each year on medical research.
</P>
<P>
   Many cancer survivors feel that given the number of lives it
takes, the disease does not get a fair share of federal research
funds distributed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), said
Ellen Stovall, president of the March.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we feel we are getting a disproportionately small
share,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The main purpose of the March, she said, was to raise public
awareness of the need for increased government funding for
research.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to an actual event on the Mall in downtown
Washington on Saturday, the nationwide show of force included
satellite events in more than 150 other U.S. cities.
</P>
<P>
   The event was supported by celebrities such as retired Army Gen.
Norman Schwarzkopf, honorary chairman of the event, and television
newsman Sam Donaldson, both survivors of prostate cancer, as well
as numerous corporate sponsors, including some pharmaceutical
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Patterned after the annual Earth Day expressions of concern
about the environment, the March was an attempt to bring together
support from different groups that have traditionally lobbied
independently, sometimes competitively, for research dollars for
specific types of cancer, said Stovall, who founded and heads the
National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know from the advance reports that 500,000 people will
participate nationwide,'' Stovall said. She said supporters were
organizing bike-a-thons, walk-a-thons, marches, road races and
rallies around the country.
</P>
<P>
   She said the idea for the event came during an appearance on
CNN's ``Larry King Live'' talk show when King asked her and
Donaldson why people ``aren't marching in the streets'' over the
need for more cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the March comes after congressional leaders and the
Clinton administration have already committed themselves to
doubling the National Institutes of Health budget for medical
research over the next five years. The NIH increase contained in an
appropriation bill still pending in Congress for next year amount
to about 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although estimates of the government investment in cancer
research since 1971, when then-president Richard Nixon committed
the country to a ``war on cancer,'' have ranged as high as $25
trillion, a hoped-for ``breakthrough'' cure has evaded scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The search has followed different tracks and moved at different
speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Some forms of cancer, most notably breast cancer, receive
substantially greater research support than others. This has been
seen as part of a ``squeaky wheel'' tendency that supposedly causes
federal agencies to be more responsive to political pressure than
to need when they set priorities for financial support or
regulatory actions.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, factors other than pressure - such as public concern or
indications a disease like HIV is spreading out of control - can
affect differences in levels of research support.
</P>
<P>
   Government data show that cancer fares less well than some other
diseases in the competition for federal funds, and far better than
some others.
</P>
<P>
   In fiscal 1997, the last year for which comparable statistics
are available, the NIH invested about $1.5 billion on AIDS
research. The National Center for Health Statistics reported that
32,655 people died of the disease in 1996, the comparable calendar
year.
</P>
<P>
   That works out to federal research support of $45,965 for each
AIDS death.
</P>
<P>
   NIH cancer research funding in fiscal 1997 was $2.76 billion and
cancer deaths in 1996 totaled 544,278 _ a research expenditure of
only $5,072 per cancer death.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the country largest killer, heart disease,
took 733,834 lives in 1996, while NIH was spending $1.08 billion on
cardiovascular research _ or $1,472 per death.
</P>
<P>
   Stovall said the March ``isn't just about funding,'' and that
some participants were concerned about issues involving quality of
care and access to treatment among minorities and underserved
communities.
</P>
<P>
   She said a ``science task force'' had developed a report on the
type of research most needed to deal with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The task force, which includes representatives of private
industry, also would recommend ``some changes, perhaps, in federal
regulatory systems that impede research.''
</P>
<P>
   The report was not available last week and would not be released
until a week after the March, she said.

DEMOCRATS PUSH NEW THEME OF `LOST WAY' REPUBLICANS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Picking up where President Clinton left off on
Friday, three past or future presidential aspirants Saturday
attacked the Republican-led Congress for focusing on the White
House scandal at the expense of passing a budget bill and other
important legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In speeches on the final day of the Democratic National
Committee's fall meetings, Vice President Al Gore, House Minority
Leader Dick Gephardt and the Rev. Jesse Jackson all joined in what
has emerged as a major Democratic Party theme with the midterm
elections less than six weeks away: In the same way that
Republicans have made impeachment of the president a force to
energize their base, Democrats are using Republican demands for
punishment as their own clarion call.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a raw partisanship on Capitol Hill,'' Gore said in a
reference to the House Judiciary Committee, which is making public
reams of documents from the independent counsel's investigation of
the president as its members weigh a vote on impeachment
proceedings. ``Whoever thought we would look back at the Contract
on America as the good old days?''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt referred to his colleagues as ``the worst Congress that
ever sat in the building down the street.'' And Jackson, in a
45-minute speech packed with Biblical references, conjured an image
of low-wage workers building ``a train, a midnight train to
Georgia, and let's put Newt Gingrich on that train.''
</P>
<P>
   The three speakers were preaching to the choir, and the audience
of several hundred Democratic faithful cheered each of them
heartily.
</P>
<P>
   But their combined themes provided more evidence that Democrats
are building a campaign strategy of demonizing a Congress hungry
for Clinton's scalp in hopes of spurring a higher Democratic
turnout in the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Republicans hold an 11-seat advantage in the House
and a five-seat advantage in the Senate. Democrats are bracing for
results that would continue to leave them in the minority in the
House and Senate, perhaps by an even greater margin.
</P>
<P>
   Before the call for impeachment had gained so much momentum,
Democrats seemed content to keep the elections localized, stressing
how administration policies on education, the economy and the
environment would help the average family .
</P>
<P>
   They still make those arguments, as all three speakers did
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But with the scandal providing such a vivid and divisive
backdrop to the campaign season, they are selling the notion that
Republican zeal is blocking progress. Indeed, many of those
attending Saturday's session wore newly minted buttons that read,
``Progress Over Partisanship,'' a phrase Clinton has used.
</P>
<P>
   Of all three speakers, it was the usually more placid Gore who
seemed to turn up the heat the most. Unlike his standard remarks
that accentuate administration policies, his speech was a full-bore
repudiation of Republican ideas. He called the GOP's economic
legislation ``the recycled, reheated, rehashed Republican
retronomics that drove this nation into a fiscal ditch.''
</P>
<P>
   And chiding the Republicans for their focus on the Whitewater
independent counsel's inquiry into the president, he said, ``When
we say health care for families, they say investigations; when we
say protect the environment, they say investigations; when we say
education, they say investigations.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt, a presidential candidate in 1988 who is expected to
challenge Gore for the party's presidential nomination in 2000,
warned the audience that two more years of a Republican majority
would result in ``nothing but investigations and fishing
expeditions.'' He also criticized the Congress for accomplishing
what he described as virtually nothing but renaming Washington's
National Airport after Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Delivering more of a Sunday morning sermon than a pure political
speech, Jackson, who has run several times for the presidential
nomination, said he ``has not decided to run the race for 2000, but
I'm going to set the pace for 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, he wove a familiar Jackson theme into his remarks:
the need to improve the lives of all Americans and to redistribute
wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't leave the poor behind,'' he said. ``Our moral obligation
is to include all, and leave no American behind. That's the way to
win.''

   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ The U.S. envoy leading efforts to resolve
the conflict in Kosovo said Saturday that Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic had ``no justification'' for pressing his
campaign against insurgents and warned that he faced a devastating
blow if he refused to stop.
</P>
<P>
   The envoy, Christopher R. Hill, who is ambassador to Macedonia,
said that the U.N. Security Council's resolution calling for an end
to the fight and NATO's threats of using military force could help
forge a diplomatic resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the crescendo of threats, the Serb-dominated Yugoslav
army and police forces have continued in recent days to shell
cities in Kosovo, driving still more civilians from their homes.
The crackdown has continued even though insurgents seeking
independence for the ethnic Albanian majority in the Serbian
province have ceased to be a fighting force, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   As Hill put it, ``We are at a phase where there is absolutely no
justification from anyone's point of view, including even the Serb
internal logic, of continuing security operations in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To continue those must be seen as a direct effort to attack
the civilian population,'' he added, ``and it's intolerable. I
think they understand that if they continue that, there will be a
reaction. And I think the reaction could be devastating for
Serbia's future.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill has been pressing the Yugoslav government and
representatives from Kosovo on a peace plan that would begin to
create democratic processes in the province but hold off three
years on resolving the issue of greater autonomy, if not
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, who last met with Milosevic on Monday, expects to receive
a reply on the proposal from Belgrade this weekend, according to a
Western official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Planners for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have already
drafted a series of strikes against Milosevic's forces, from a
limited cruise-missile attack to an air campaign that could
increase in intensity. Several NATO allies, including Germany and
the Netherlands, have publicly announced their intent to contribute
warplanes to any campaign.

TAKING A TOLL AFTER THE STORM 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic _ Four days after Hurricane
Georges clobbered the Dominican Republic with shattering force _
and as help arrives from around the world _ this Caribbean country
is still counting its dead.
</P>
<P>
   With 200 confirmed deaths, government officials say they fear
scores more lives may have been lost as whole blocks of homes were
splintered and the storm's drenching rains flooded towns and
villages in an arc stretching as far as 100 miles from this capital
city of 3 million people.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the flood waters recede, the bodies keep emerging,'' said
Adriano Tejada, the chief spokesman for President Leonel Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
   The government estimates that more than 500,000 homes were
damaged and that more than 500 people were injured. Thousands of
acres of sugar cane, coffee and tobacco, the country's main crops,
have been ruined. Clusters of people are camped along some of the
main roads, sharing food and trying to piece together what they can
of their broken homes. The United States and France have sent
disaster relief aid.
</P>
<P>
   The capital is pocked with damage. Roofs are gone, windows
broken, awnings torn and tattered, and huge metal billboards with
nothing left but the iron frames line the roads. But almost
magically, many houses and stores appear to have been virtually
untouched. Everywhere, though, trees and shrubs have been snapped
off, shredded and sometimes uprooted.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Ventura, the mayor of Santo Domingo who is also a popular
merengue singer with a big following among Dominican emigres in the
United States, said it was difficult to put a price on the damage
in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not quantified the damage,'' he said. ``It's
enormous.''
</P>
<P>
   In a flight over one of the most severely battered cities, San
Pedro de Macoris about 30 miles east of here, clumps of wood and
tin houses looked as if they had been smashed by an angry giant.
Scores of other houses had been turned into what from the air
looked like rows of tiny doll houses with their roofs lifted off.
</P>
<P>
   A huge sugar mill lost all but a few strips of tin from its roof
and at the Tetelo Vargas Stadium, where the Estrellas Orientales
(Oriental Stars) play the nation's favorite pastime, baseball,
racks of spotlights dangled into the bleachers and much of the tin
sunshade was gone.
</P>
<P>
   While rescue teams were trying to reach people in outlying
areas, the streets of the capital were jammed Saturday with cars
and trucks snaking past downed power lines, trees and heaps of
roofing and rubble.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first day that people have really been able to
move,'' said Leonardo Luzon, 44, whose house lost its roof and an
outside wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were trees and pieces of houses blocking all the
streets. Now people are out looking for building supplies and
food.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Much of the country has been without electricity since the
hurricane hit on Tuesday, and with no power to operate pumps,
drinking water has been in short supply. At least a dozen men,
women and teen-agers were lined up with plastic jugs and pails at a
water hose at one house on the edge of the capital at midday.
Others made their way through the wreckage balancing buckets of
water on their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the water was fresh and clean, good for drinking, one
woman struggling with a heavy pail that she had filled at one of
the many water trucks that have been parked in neighborhoods simply
wagged her finger and her head in a strident no. But she was taking
the water anyway. She said she would boil it and hope for the best.
</P>
<P>
   The disaster stirred human misery and cruelty. Julio Romero, a
handyman whose tiny home on the outskirts of Santo Domingo was
destroyed, had in recent days collected a pile of lumber and cinder
blocks to begin rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
   But the other night, as he slept with neighbors who put him up,
thieves made off with the material he had collected. ``They are
evil, but they are clever,'' he said. ``They prey on those of us
who are suffering, and that's how they survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Dolores Santos, 52, a neighbor of Romero, echoed those thoughts
as she surveyed the heap of wood beams, glass, tables and chairs
that was once her home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thieves have taken everything,'' she said screaming, as if on
the verge of tears. ``They took TVs, wood, whatever worthwhile that
was left. How can people do this to each other?''
</P>
<P>
   Mothers and their children wandered the outskirts of Santo
Domingo like nomads.
</P>
<P>
   Veronica Suna led her 5-year-old son by the hand as they walked
over to survey the damage to their humble four-room home. Almost in
tears she looked at the child, who was barefoot and wearing only
blue shorts.

EDITORIAL: REDUCING RUSSIAN NUCLEAR DANGERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, Sept. 27:
</P>
<P>
   Russia's idle nuclear weapons complexes are dangerously short of
money, leaving thousands of skilled scientists and workers unpaid
or unemployed. Some may be tempted to sell their expertise to
countries like North Korea, Iran and Iraq that are trying to
develop nuclear weapons of their own. But the Russians could put
their skills to work for their own country's commercial and social
benefit, if funds were provided to train and employ them.
</P>
<P>
   That is the purpose of a welcome new Russian-U.S. agreement
signed last week in Vienna, Austria. Though the $30 million funding
envisioned for the next budget year is modest compared with the
size of the problem, the agreement marks a healthy recognition by
both countries that despite political changes in Moscow, they share
an urgent interest in containing the spread of Russia's nuclear
know-how and materials to other nations.
</P>
<P>
   The money will go mainly toward retraining nuclear scientists
for work in private businesses and encouraging the conversion of
nuclear weapons and missile plants to commercial operations like
the production of auto parts. Future efforts should go further,
including conversion to non-commercial work, like cleaning up after
nuclear accidents and developing new methods of determining whether
arms-control agreements are strictly enforced.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow has been looking to create 30,000 to 50,000 jobs for its
nuclear weapons workers over the next three to five years. Those
numbers have probably increased because of Russia's economic
problems. Ideally, the United States and its European allies should
be contributing about $100 million a year toward solving this
problem. The administration has been proceeding cautiously in
deference to congressional conservatives who seem unwilling to
recognize that the Cold War is over and that U.S. national security
can sometimes best be served by cooperation with Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and America began cooperating to defuse Cold War nuclear
perils even before the end of Communist rule in Moscow. Though the
new Russian government led by Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov is
retreating from economic reform, there is no sign of any retreat on
arms control issues. In fact, Primakov has announced his intention
to press Russia's parliament to ratify the long-stalled nuclear
arms reduction treaty with the United States. The nuclear complex
conversion agreement indicates an interest in addressing other
aspects of the nuclear weapons problem as well. It is in America's
interest to respond generously.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: SHOULD THE FED DO MORE THAN CUT RATES? 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 BY FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan wants to cut interest rates, which means the
Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee is likely to do just that
when it meets Tuesday. But the meeting may still be contentious
because there are two very different worlds that will be affected.
</P>
<P>
   In the first world, which includes the United States, there are
only limited signs of problems. The labor market is tight, wages
are rising and consumers are spending at a pace strong enough to
offset a weakening industrial sector. The Dow Jones industrial
average is down 14 percent from its highs, but still up for the
year. Speculative juices continue to flow. Looking at that world,
one might expect the Fed to raise interest rates, but never to cut
them.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the other world, which includes Asia, Eastern
Europe and Latin America. It is characterized by what Abby Joseph
Cohen of Goldman, Sachs calls ``fear, uncertainty, doubt and
despair.'' It is a world that has seen currencies and stock markets
plunge, with credit crunches and recessions in many countries. That
world desperately needs help, which lower U.S. interest rates might
provide.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it is hard to believe that those two worlds can
continue on their different paths indefinitely. ``It is just not
credible that the United States, or for that matter Europe, can
remain an oasis of prosperity unaffected by a world that is
experiencing greatly increased stress,'' Greenspan, the chairman of
the Federal Reserve Board, told the Senate Budget Committee last
week.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, Greenspan knew something when he testified that
the rest of us were soon going to find out. It was that the
Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund, run by John Meriwether,
was in danger of collapsing. (By coincidence, the insolvent
Japanese bank whose fate has paralyzed the Japanese political
system is the Long-Term Credit Bank. Does all this discredit
long-term investing?) On the same day Greenspan testified, bankers
meeting at the New York Fed's offices agreed to pony up $3.5
billion to keep the fund from liquidating.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, it appeared that investors were in retreat
everywhere. But in New York, the most speculative stocks have
roared back, while other shares have stabilized. Consider the
Internet stocks. Yahoo plunged 43 percent over less than two months
this summer, bottoming on Sept. 1. Since then the stock has more
than doubled. Last week, after a prolonged period in which Wall
Street brought no initial public offerings to market, another
Internet company, Ebay, went public. Priced at $18, the shares
leaped to more than $50. The 31-year-old founder now has stock
worth $692 million. He paid $14,262 for the shares.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who think that speculation should be of no
concern to the Fed, but Greenspan at times has indicated he was
worried. The collapse in Asia would not be this bad had not
speculators first flooded the region with capital, then all tried
to take their money and run at about the same time. The renewal of
the Internet craze can be seen as a sign of the kind of froth that
caused Greenspan to coin the phrase ``irrational exuberance,'' and
lowering interest rates might simply encourage more of it.
</P>
<P>
   So what is the Fed to do? There is a risk that it will lower
rates only a bit, doing too little for the rest of the world
because it fears being too stimulative in this country. But a bold
alternative would be to cut rates meaningfully while also
discouraging speculation by raising the margin requirements for
stock purchases. Investors have been able to buy stocks with a 50
percent down payment since Jan. 3, 1974, when the Fed cut the rate
from 65 percent in the midst of a severe bear market.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, such a change would not put much of a damper on
hedge funds, which have ways, using derivatives, to speculate while
putting up far less capital than 50 percent. Some in Congress want
to curb that speculation, although it is not easy to see how it
could be done without simply driving the business offshore. But
smaller speculators are subject to Fed rules. It will be
interesting to see if the Fed even considers doing something about
them.

SUIT CONTESTS INSURERS' INSISTENCE ON GENERIC CAR PARTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., N.Y., Pa., Mass., Nev.)  (mk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Mark Covington drives his 1992 Chevy Cavalier
at night, the beam of the left headlight wobbles across the road,
and in daylight, the red paint on the hood shows an odd ridge on
the left side.
</P>
<P>
   He blames his insurance company: After his wife crashed the car,
he said, he took the car to one of the best body shops in Laurel,
Miss., but the shop had to use generic parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``State Farm just absolutely refused to put GM parts on it,''
Covington said. Instead, the insurance company insisted on
``imitation parts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They said that by using those, it would restore our vehicle to
the original condition and value, which it did not do,'' Covington
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers are seeking to add him to a large class-action suit
against State Farm. But the suit has alarmed consumer advocates and
the attorneys general of New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and
Nevada, along with the National Association of State Insurance
Commissioners. They have all filed briefs supporting State Farm.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs say the case involves 5 million drivers and could
cost State Farm $2 billion, but their opponents say it would drive
up insurance rates nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers who filed the class-action suit quote a study done for
General Motors that says that cars repaired with generic parts lose
$1,670 in resale value, and that some generic parts can be
dangerous. Insurance companies dispute both ideas.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers, who brought suit in Marion, Ill., say the use of
generic parts constitutes fraud under Illinois law. ``They breach
their contract every time they put these flimsy, imitation parts on
a vehicle,'' said Don Barrett, one of the lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance companies say they have a good reason for
demanding generic replacements. ``They are one of the factors that
contributes to our being able to keep our premiums as low as we
can,'' said David Hurst, a spokesman for State Farm. When an
insured driver has an accident, everyone is better off if
replacement parts cost less, he said.

BUSINESS HOTEL MAKES ROOM FOR TODDLERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JANE GROSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARSIPPANY, N.J. _ At this week's staff meeting, Cathy Hart will
ask the employees at the Marriott Residence Inn here how to make
Halloween a festive occasion for the hotel's guests.
</P>
<P>
   How about reverse trick or treating, with hotel employees
delivering candy to each room? Or maybe a pumpkin-carving contest
in the courtyard?
</P>
<P>
   These are novel challenges for Ms. Hart, general manager of this
new hotel, who is more accustomed to worrying about data ports and
treadmills for the jam of businessmen in the exercise room at 6
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Those details were in place when the apartment-style hotel
opened in May, geared to the business traveler on extended
assignment, a growing niche in the industry. But to everyone's
surprise, the clients here have been mostly families with children,
who stay a month on average.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like the LaMond family from Kalamazoo, Mich., are in the
midst of relocation and waiting to close on a house. A few, like
the Van Warts, are renovating homes in the vicinity. Others, like
the Knotts, are on extended assignments and don't want to be apart
that long.
</P>
<P>
   The solitary business people _ and there are some _ seem to
function in a parallel universe. They come downstairs for their
breakfast by 6:30, when they can watch CNN in peace on the lobby
television. An hour later, the room is vibrating with boisterous
children fighting for the last box of Froot Loops and enjoying
Nickelodeon.
</P>
<P>
   For the families, the place seems to work on the principle that
misery loves company. The displaced gather in the lobby here, where
cartoons blast on the wide-screen TV and the kitchen staff appears
with hot cocoa just as the school bus pulls up each afternoon. They
trade relocation horror stories, the kind that friends not in the
midst of moving quickly find boring.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask how can you be so good humored,'' said Jen Van
Wart, who remains cheerful despite twin 3-year-old boys with bad
colds and a 16-month-old who has just learned to shriek. ``Well,
what choice do you have?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Van Wart compared the experience to a college dormitory,
with the distraction of children. She squirrels away quarters for
the washing machine and always seems to come upstairs with one sock
too many or one too few. She meets her new friends in the lobby for
gossip before dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The Van Warts' baby, Paige, learned to walk here, by imitating
Logan Knott, who is a month older and also took his first steps in
a hotel lobby. Now Paige and Logan toddle about in tandem, managing
not to trip on the twins' Batman cars.
</P>
<P>
   Logan's mother, Angela, set up housekeeping here in August and
won't return home to Arizona until February, when her husband
finishes installing a corporate software system. Part of the
justification for building the hotel here is the unusual
concentration of corporations nearby, including Lucent
Technologies, American Home Products and Nabisco.
</P>
<P>
   The needs of the families have led to improvisation. High chairs
were clearly a necessity. So were games, toys and children's books.
In a room adjoining Ms. Hart's office there are Pictionary, plastic
foam noodles for the indoor pool and ``Rabbit's Search for a Little
House.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hart wrote to the local school district affirming that the
children lived here so they could enroll. And she drew up a release
form so the hotel, without liability, could accept delivery of cars
that had been transported from one address to another.
</P>
<P>
   A decision was made to allow pets, but some housekeepers won't
go into a room if a big dog is there, like the 100-pound Akita that
belongs to Gabrielle LaMond. That room is cleaned while Ms. LaMond
drives her daughter to school.
</P>
<P>
   Once there was a mix-up when a moving van made a stop here to
pick up a family's belongings, on the way to a new house. Later,
Ms. Hart went into the vacated room and discovered that a couch was
missing.
</P>
<P>
   But more than confusion, there is camaraderie. When Ms. Knott
worried about how to entertain Logan in winter, the Van Warts were
quick with advice. Go to Gymboree for mother-and-baby exercise
classes, they told her. Try the children's readings at Barnes &AMP;
Noble. And don't forget to buy mittens and a winter coat.

N.Y. SEEKS TO ASSESS COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   With its ratings of primary and secondary schools well
established, the New York state Department of Education is
embarking on an effort to assess the state's colleges and
universities, both public and private.
</P>
<P>
   As early as 2001, the state could issue its first report
evaluating the performance of colleges. The format is yet to be
worked out, and department officials are reluctant to speculate
about specifics. But they say the wide range of institutions _ from
research universities to community colleges and trade schools _
means that the report must be more complex than the school report
cards, perhaps something more like the reports issued by U.S. News
&AMP; World Report and the Princeton Review, but somehow going beyond
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly U.S. News &AMP; World Report has taken an opportunity,
but my personal view is that the higher education community could
do a better job,'' Richard Mills, the state education commissioner,
said. ``The fact that their reports are so eagerly consumed by the
public tells me there are a lot people who want to know.''
</P>
<P>
   The department is seeking an additional $400,000 in its budget
to help pay for the evaluation efforts, which it plans to shape in
the coming year with the help of educators in New York and
nationally and with consultants.
</P>
<P>
   In the next week or two, it will name a new higher-education
advisory council that will include about 20 college presidents, the
chancellors of the state's two public university systems and other
leaders from public and private institutions. The department hopes
to use the council as a sounding board on higher education policy
as well as on the new evaluation process.
</P>
<P>
   And in February, the department plans to hold what it is calling
a ``summit'' on higher education in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Primary and secondary education are moving in the right
direction now,'' Carl Hayden, chancellor of the board of regents,
said. ``It is time to turn the focus to higher education and to
really bring the discussion of higher education issues to the
fore.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the board had already taken aggressive steps in higher
education, including its removal of Adelphi University's trustees
and the imposition of new teacher education standards, and now
planned to move even more broadly.
</P>
<P>
   Measuring the quality of New York's diverse higher education
institutions _ 260 degree-granting colleges and universities and
260 other postsecondary institutions _ is something Mills and the
regents have wanted to do for some time.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Mills proposed a higher-education report card
that would have applied 41 performance indicators to colleges,
measurements like graduate employment rates, changes in tuition and
the proportion of students needing remedial education. But he was
criticized for proposing a ``one-size-fits-all'' approach, and it
was put on hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that it wasn't yet ripe,'' Mills said last week.
</P>
<P>
   This time, he is trying to remedy that problem by recognizing
the differences and inviting college leaders to help him and the
Regents devise ways that take them into account while judging the
performance of institutions with widely differing missions _ from a
Hostos Community College, for example, to a graduate research
university like Rockefeller University.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Patton, deputy commissioner for higher education and the
official charged with leading the assessment effort, said he
expected that some criteria, like graduation rates and graduates'
scores on licensing exams, would be applied to all or most
institutions. But he said he expected colleges to define their
special goals and to figure out ways to measure whether they are
meeting them. ``It does require faculty to talk more about their
goals and objectives,'' Patton said. ``We aren't trying to tell
them how to do it. We want them to develop the methodologies.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he hoped that a framework would be in place by next year
and that assessments would begin by 2000. Any proposals will be
subject to public discussion and approval by the Regents.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While many states are trying to make their universities more
accountable, the New York effort is more ambitious than most.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, unlike most state boards, the board of regents
has jurisdiction over all higher education in the state, including
its two Ivy League universities (Columbia and Cornell), religious
institutions like St. John's and Fordham, and commercial colleges
like DeVry Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   For another, many performance-measurement systems have gotten
bogged down in counting what is easy to count, like numbers of
students and scores on tests.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Newman, president of the Education Commission of the
States, a nonprofit organization in Denver that advises state
officials on education policy, called the effort a ``complex
undertaking'' _ significantly more complicated than assessing high
schools, which as a group have much more similar objectives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the states that have struggled with this haven't done
much once they have gotten past simpler measures to the more
profound question of whether students are learning what they need
to know to be effective citizens in the 21st century,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Standards have become a mantra in education. Mills, who has an
oversize set of alphabet blocks spelling ``S-T-A-N-D-A-R-D-S'' atop
the tall bookcase behind his desk, has made an art of figuring out
what they ought to be and then applying them.
</P>
<P>
   He has laid out standards for his own performance as education
commissioner. He has adopted the system of school report cards for
rating primary and secondary schools in the state. And he is
imposing strict new requirements for teacher education programs and
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   His plan to evaluate colleges, which has yet to be publicly
announced, has drawn a mixed response. Some educators, like Newman
of the Education Commission of the States, applauded it.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time in American higher education, we assumed
quality, and that was a modestly reasonable assumption,'' he said.
But those days are over, he added, because of the enormous change
taking place in who is providing higher education, the new
technologies being used, the broader range of students and the very
different demands on graduates in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, we can't make the simple assumptions we've
all made that just because students have been through our
educational process they are well educated,'' he said. ``Seat time
is not a good enough measure of quality any more.''
</P>
<P>
   But others question whether another layer of measurement will be
worth the time and cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe very strongly in accountability and in people's
right to know,'' said Lois DeFleur, president of SUNY-Binghamton
and chairwoman of The American Council on Education. ``But we
already devote unbelievable resources to the accrediting process
and performance assessment and evaluation of our programs. They
have to understand the cost in time and energy.''
</P>
<P>
   L. Jay Oliva, president of New York University, offered a
similar perspective: ``There is no institution in the whole world
that spends more time looking at itself than universities,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Patton said he recognized the concerns, but added that he hoped
colleges and universities would ultimately see the system as a
benefit for them, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be an avenue for them to do better,'' he said. ``And
it will send a message to the community at large about how higher
education is improving.''

POLITICAL BRIEFS: FORBES SLAMS SURVEY IN ARIZ.; DISSIDENT GREENS IN
N.M.; RACE TIGHTENS IN S.C. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Tenn.)  (mk) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES JR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back during the 1996 presidential campaign, Steve Forbes, the
publishing magnate, spent the better part of $4 million, much of it
from his personal fortune, to win a surprise victory in Arizona's
Republican primary. Since then, his eye now fixed on the Election
2000 primary, he has returned often to the Grand Canyon state to
meet and greet and to preach his special brand of conservative
economics.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few days ago he spoke at a fund-raiser for a fellow
Republican, Rep. J.D. Hayworth, who is running for a second term in
Arizona's 6th Congressional District. And in another week or so, he
is scheduled to be the keynote speaker at the annual fund-raising
dinner of the Arizona Christian Coalition, a major force in the
state's politics.
</P>
<P>
   Is he making any political progress? Maybe not, if a newly
released presidential preference poll is to be believed.
</P>
<P>
   Taken late last month by Arizona Chamber Info, a subsidiary of
the Arizona Chamber of Commerce, it asked 231 registered
Republicans to pick a favorite from a list of party members who
have indicated that they might run in 2000. Topping the list were
Jack Kemp, the 1996 vice presidential candidate, with about 18
percent, and House Speaker Newt Gingrich, 14. Among bottom dwellers
were Gov. George Bush of Texas, with two percent, and Forbes and
Lamar Alexander, the former governor of Tennessee, each with zero.
</P>
<P>
   How soon they forget ...
</P>
<P>
   Not so, Forbes counters. He slammed the survey as ``preposterous
fiction'' and ``random selection that just doesn't cut it.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a sampling of just 231 voters is on the thin side, as
political polls go. Nevertheless, chamber officials defend the
accuracy of their survey, calculating its margin of error to be
plus or minus about 5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Since 52 percent of the respondents were undecided this early in
the run-up to Election 2000, the chamber officials added, there is
plenty of time and room for Forbes to improve and make another good
showing.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, maybe Forbes should forget about Arizona and
concentrate more on another state he has also been working hard _
Iowa, quadrennial home of the first presidential caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   In a new Mason-Dixon poll of likely GOP caucus-goers, Forbes and
Bush ended up in a dead heat, with the rest of the wannabe field
lagging badly, most notably Alexander, who has spent more time
trodding the Election 2000 trail than just about anybody. In Iowa a
mere 2 percent of poll respondents picked him as their favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Greens Abandon One of Their Own
</P>
<P>
   There is no state where the Green Party is stronger or more
active than New Mexico. In recent years, Green candidates, with
their appeal to environmentalists, hard-left liberals and
counter-culturists, have helped put several New Mexican Republicans
in office by stealing away the votes of dissident Democrats
concerned about the ideological purity of Democratic
standard-bearers.
</P>
<P>
   And this year they are again a political force to reckon with in
several important races.
</P>
<P>
   Arguments by Democratic leaders that third-party swing voting is
ultimately counterproductive have been ignored by Green leaders.
They contend that the only way to force Democrats to pay attention
to Green issues is to cost them elections.
</P>
<P>
   But now a raison d'etre fissure has opened in the ranks of the
Greens.
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago, nine members of the party issued a statement
calling on members to abandon the Green candidate, Carol Miller, in
this year's House race in New Mexico's 3rd Congressional District.
Instead, the statement said, Greens should support state Attorney
General Tom Udall, the Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   If they don't, the statement warned, the hard-right Republican
incumbent, Rep. Bill Redmond, will surely win a second term _ just
as he won his first term in a special election last year when
Greens split the Democratic vote.
</P>
<P>
   The Miller candidacy ``is detrimental to the goal of building
the Green Party'' and, in the end, will be seen by the public as
``destructive,'' the statement concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Miller, a health care consultant, argued in response that
her presence in the race ``guarantees'' that Udall will take more
progressive positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole point of having third parties in political races,''
she added, ``is so that people have to take positions on the
issues. This isn't just a smile and a handshake.''
</P>
<P>
   Can a letter from nine unhappy members of a party whose
membership numbers in the thousands have any effect?
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the dissidents is Abraham Gutmann of Albuquerque,
a founder of the state party.
</P>
<P>
   More Troubling Signs for a Governor
</P>
<P>
   More re-election problems for Gov. David Beasley of South
Carolina ...
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few weeks, several Republican colleagues, some of
them party leaders, have begun to whisper that his campaign for a
second term is flagging and that his Democratic challenger, Jim
Hodges, the former minority leader of the South Carolina House,
just might be coming on strong enough to nip him at the tape in
November.
</P>
<P>
   The governor denies there is any slippage. At the same time, he
has begun to hammer that Hodges is one of the most outspoken
advocates of ``organized'' gambling, especially video poker and the
lottery, in a state where the Christian right is perhaps the most
powerful political force.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, mindful that many voters have never forgiven him
for suggesting several years ago that the Confederate flag should
no longer be flown over the state Capitol, he has begun reaching
out to members of South Carolina's many Southern heritage groups,
still an important constituency in the state where the Civil War
started.
</P>
<P>
   Never again, he promises, will he try to lower the Stars and
Bars.
</P>
<P>
   But no sooner did the governor begin to make amends on the flag
issue than a major heritage group, the Palmetto League, started
running an ad that said he still could not be trusted.
</P>
<P>
   The governor countered with an ad that tried to shift the
political focus to Hodges' veracity. ``There's a difference between
what he says and what he does,'' the announcer intoned as Hodges'
picture appeared on the screen. Then, as Hodges' face slowly
``morphed'' into the face of Clinton, the announcer asked: ``Remind
you of anybody?''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the week, a new poll conducted by the Palmetto
Project found that three of every five adult South Carolinians were
dissatisfied with the ``direction'' of the state and that, whatever
the governor might think, only one in four believed gambling was
the most important issue in the governor's race.
</P>
<P>
   The others, three of every four, said the most important issue
was education _ the issue that Hodges is hitting hardest.

PRIVATE GROUP SAYS CITY OVERRATES PARK CONDITIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Conditions in New York City's parks are considerably
poorer than city officials say, partly because most of the more
than 27,000 acres of parkland are never inspected, a private parks
group says in a report to be issued Monday. It found benches
collapsing, paths in shambles, landscape overrun by weeds and
almost no working drinking fountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the kinds of conditions that any New Yorker will
find on any given day walking into a park,'' said Marcia Reiss,
policy director for the group, the Parks Council.
</P>
<P>
   The council, a research and advocacy group, said the recently
released Mayor's Management Report painted a flawed and inadequate
picture of the park system. The reason, it said, is that the report
is based _ as all past mayoral reports have been _ only on
inspections of playgrounds and parks of less than six acres. This
traditional, more limited means of analysis has shown park
conditions to improve steadily, to 80 percent rated acceptable
today from 39 percent three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Parks Council studied 10 large parks not now
inspected by the city. In them, it found that only 56 percent of
park features were in acceptable condition. Many pathways, trees,
lakes, lawns and especially drinking fountains of the 10 parks were
found to be in unacceptable condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The poor conditions we found in the 10 parks are a strong
argument for increased city funding for park maintenance,'' Ann
Buttenweiser, president of the Parks Council, said. ``But the first
step is broader park inspections.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's parks commissioner, Henry Stern, sharply disagreed
that park conditions had deteriorated, citing the work of 6,000
welfare recipients assigned to the parks and 25,000 volunteers. Of
the Parks Council's report, , he said, ``They look at wine and call
it vinegar.''
</P>
<P>
   But he agreed that broader inspections were ``an excellent
suggestion'' and said he was ordering a pilot program to do the
larger reviews urged by the Parks Council. The new program is to
start this fall with what the agency calls its flagship parks,
including Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in Queens, Riverside Park in
Manhattan, Prospect Park in Brooklyn, Van Cortlandt and Pelham Bay
Parks in the Bronx and the collection of parks on Staten Island
called the Greenbelt.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The commissioner said the broader inspections would be more
difficult than the checklist approach used for playgrounds. ``The
smaller sites are more ratable,'' he said. ``How do you know if a
woodland is good?''
</P>
<P>
   In defense of the current system, Stern said that playgrounds
were the most intensively used part of most parks and that the
safety of play equipment was a critical concern. The Parks Council,
which first raised private money to begin playground inspections in
the 1970s, agreed that the city ``has done a superb job of bringing
heavily used playgrounds up to standard.''
</P>
<P>
   But the vast majority of park space is shamefully deteriorating,
the council charged. In the nine parks that have drinking
fountains, the council found only one fountain that worked. That
was in Springfield Park in southeastern Queens, which has only one
fountain. Pathways were in acceptable condition in only three of
the 10 parks, and more than half the parks had a large number of
trees with dead or low-hanging branches along pathways, the group
said. Invasive vines and other plants that choke and kill native
trees were found in 69 percent of the 10 parks' natural areas, it
said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the study found no abandoned cars, which a
decade ago had littered many of the city's parks.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia University's School of Public and International Affairs
joined the Parks Council in devising, conducting and analyzing its
report. Staff members from the two organizations and volunteers
visited two parks in each of the five boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   The Parks Council study is part of the group's campaign to
increase public spending on parks, which was cut dramatically
during the previous administration and has recovered only fitfully
under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. The idea of the council performing
its own inspection gained support when the council's analysis
showed that the 85 percent of park areas not inspected receive very
little staff or management attention.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the council found that the large areas of
uninspected parkland receive more capital spending than the places
that are inspected. The report suggested that it could therefore
not be concluded that capital spending was directed toward
improving inspection scores. The report said the arrangement raised
the possibility that conditions would be allowed to deteriorate
until a major capital expenditure was required.
</P>
<P>
   ``While this study shows substantial capital investment in the
10 parks we examined, it also reveals that limited numbers of park
workers are assigned to maintain this investment,'' said Elizabeth
A. Cooke, executive director of the Parks Council. ``Without
increased personnel, we can expect deferred maintenance and the
need for continued capital expense in much of the park system.''
</P>
<P>
   Park volunteers and their organizations said they hoped the
study, and the city's commitment to follow up with its own
inspections, would be useful in their fight for more money for
parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't fault the Parks Department,'' said Susan Morgenthau,
president of Friends of Van Cortlandt Park. ``What can you do with
the lack of funding?''  &QL;

ARCHIE M. SMITH JR., 78, VIRGINIA VINTNER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.)  (js) 
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Archie M. Smith Jr., a Virginia winemaker who had
the rare distinction of succeeding in a field where Thomas
Jefferson failed, died on Sept. 19 at his home in Middleburg, Va.
He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   His son, Archie M. Smith 3rd, said the cause was Lou Gehrig's
disease _ amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   Archie M. Smith Jr., whose 58-acre Meredyth Vineyards is just a
few counties from Jefferson's Monticello, was one of a small group
of pioneering winemakers who fulfilled Jefferson's agrarian goal of
making a good wine in Virginia that provides a livelihood for
farmers and their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Jefferson didn't know was how to grow grapes,'' said
James Gabler, a Baltimore lawyer and expert on both wine and
Jefferson. ``Now they know different kinds of grapes, know weather
and know soil.''
</P>
<P>
   Meredyth Vineyards, which Smith started in 1975 with the boom in
American wine consumption, now makes 35,000 cases a year, which is
small in comparison with many California vineyards. But it
represents an achievement for an industry that barely existed a
generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   Archie Smith 3rd said, ``We are part of the new wave _ we were
the first farm winery in Virginia _ where you grow your own grapes,
make the wine and sell it.''
</P>
<P>
   The elder Smith graduated from the University of Virginia in
1949 with a major in psychology, his son said, and became a farmer,
raising cattle, corn and hay. Before college, he was was a Marine
Corps combat flier in the Pacific in World War II and was in the
first wave of F4U planes that flew from aircraft carriers and
attacked Japanese positions on Guadalcanal. He was injured and
awarded a Purple Heart after his plane crashed in the battle for
Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   At first Smith's farming efforts seemed headed for failure. ``We
sat around the kitchen table one Saturday night and agreed we
weren't going to make it,'' Archie Smith 3rd said, adding that his
father was concerned that they would be driven out by the
increasing suburbanization of the Virginia countryside. The result
was Meredyth Vineyards.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Payton, a wine promotion specialist in Virginia's
Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, said that by 1979,
the state's wine industry amounted to only seven vineyards,
including Meredyth. Today there are 52 Virginia wineries.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, land devoted to vineyards was just 286 acres. Now the
total is 1,500 acres, and 205,000 cases with a retail value of $24
million were sold last year, Ms. Payton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meredyth Vineyards is one of the founders of the industry and
set the course for the modern era of winemaking in Virginia,'' she
added.
</P>
<P>
   Gabler said that Virginia's wines, like New York's, were better
in the whites. ``I don't think much of the reds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son, Smith is survived by his wife of 55
years, Josephine Watters Smith; another son, Robert B. of
Kensington, Md.; a daughter, Susan M. of Middleburg; and three
grandchildren.

DR. EDWARD CHRISTOPHER WHITMONT, 85, JUNGIAN PSYCHOANALYST AND
TEACHER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)  (js) 
 By ERICA GOODE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Edward Christopher Whitmont, a Jungian psychoanalyst and
homeopathic physician who introduced many Americans to the
fundamentals of Jungian psychology through his writing and
teaching, died on Monday at his home in Sherman, Conn. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer of the thymus, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   A founding member of the International Association for
Analytical Psychology and the C.G. Jung Institute of New York,
Whitmont spent much of his life exploring the territory where mind,
body and spirit intersect, synthesizing and expanding upon ideas
and methods drawn from diverse areas of psychology, medicine,
science and religion.
</P>
<P>
   Whitmont's 1969 book, ``The Symbolic Quest,'' was the first text
to apply the Swiss psychologist Carl Gustav Jung's complicated
writings on archetypes to the therapist's daily work with patients.
The book quickly became essential reading for clinicians seeking an
understanding of Jung. A later book, ``Psyche and Substance''
(1980), explored the connections between Jungian theory and
homeopathic medicine, and in ``Return of the Goddess'' (1982),
Whitmont emphasized the role of the feminine in human psychology.
</P>
<P>
   He was also known for his creative approach to working with
unconscious material, the images found in dreams and other areas of
mental life. ``He instructed a whole generation of Jungian analysts
in the dynamic approach to dreams,'' said Beverly Zabriskie, a
Jungian analyst in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Vienna in 1912, Whitmont received his medical degree
from the University of Vienna in 1934, then immigrated to the
United States four years later. His interest in Jungian psychology
was sparked by a patient who sought Whitmont's help because ``a
dream told me to come to you.'' His interest in homeopathy sprang
from an acquaintance with the homeopathist Elizabeth Wright
Hubbard. Whitmont later traveled to Switzerland to meet Jung, and
they corresponded.
</P>
<P>
   Whitmont continued teaching at the institute and writing until
his death.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his longtime companion, Sylvia Brinton Perera;
four sons, Peter Whitmont of Boulder, Colo.; Dr. Martin Whitmont of
Bozeman, Mont.; Dr. Andrew Whitmont of Yakima, Wash.; and Dr.
Ronald Whitmont of Amenia, N.Y.; two daughters, Cathy Sarah
Schaleger of St. Paul and Deborah Massell of Manhattan; and nine
grandchildren.

TRUTH IS ELUSIVE IN VALLONE'S STATEMENTS ABOUT PATAKI 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the night Peter Vallone won the Democratic primary
to run against Gov. George E. Pataki, he told supporters in a
speech broadcast statewide that Pataki ``wrote the Republican
Party's anti-choice platform in 1990.''
</P>
<P>
   At campaign stops, Vallone, the New York City Council speaker,
often says that Pataki has doubled state debt and doubled college
tuition. And he told reporters recently, ``Al D'Amato wrote out a
check for $3-and-a-half million in one week to George Pataki.''
</P>
<P>
   What all these statements have in common is that they are
untrue.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone is not the first politician to cast ill-founded
aspersions on an opponent, and in fact, Pataki has been known to
toss off a few. A television advertisement for the governor, for
instance, says that Vallone voted 78 times for ``higher taxes,''
but most of those votes were to continue existing taxes. And Pataki
has been roundly criticized for stretching the truth about his
record with inaccurate claims, like his easily refuted assertion
that New York is a national leader in job growth.
</P>
<P>
   But the governor has not said anything notably inaccurate about
Vallone because, in his best Rose Garden style, he has barely
mentioned his opponent. Vallone, on the other hand, has shown what
might charitably be called a gift for hyperbole when talking about
Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is another indication that Peter Vallone just doesn't
know the basic facts,'' said Zenia Mucha, Pataki's campaign
manager. ``We have warned him about engaging in these kinds of
distortions of the governor's record.''
</P>
<P>
   Going on the offensive is standard practice for a candidate in
Vallone's position: a challenger, trailing badly in the polls, with
much less money than the incumbent. But attacks based on
inaccuracies could easily backfire, exposing him to charges of
dishonesty. And in some instances, by overstating his case, he has
undercut what could have been effective _ and accurate _ attacks on
the governor.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Pataki's record on debt has drawn harsh criticism
from independent fiscal analysts, and attack ads from B. Thomas
Golisano, the Independence Party candidate, and Lt. Gov. Betsy
McCaughey Ross, the Liberal Party nominee. State debt has grown
about 30 percent during Pataki's four years in office, and it is
projected to rise more than 20 percent in the next four, but it has
not doubled, as Vallone has charged.
</P>
<P>
   The governor raised public college tuition about 30 percent in
1995 and cut financial aid for low-income students, but did not
double tuition, as Vallone has said.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Ragone, a spokesman for Vallone, refused to back away from
those claims. ``George Pataki has increased state debt and college
tuitions enough that if working New Yorkers aren't already paying
double, they're seeing double,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Vallone's claim about tuition took into account
tuition increases and aid reductions that Pataki proposed in 1996
and 1997, but which were defeated by the Legislature. If those
plans had taken effect, the nominal tuition would have increased by
50 percent, and the tuition actually paid by students would have
nearly doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Of Vallone's comments about the governor, his statement on the
Republican Party's abortion stance was the most patently untrue.
</P>
<P>
   At the Republican convention in 1990, Pataki, then an
assemblyman chairman of the platform committee, wrote a party
platform that supported abortion rights for the first time. He
prevailed after a bitter fight, and over the objections of the
party's powerful anti-abortion figures, including his future
mentor, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   Ragone traced Vallone's statement to an erroneous newspaper
article, and said the candidate had not repeated the mistake since
primary night.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone's claim that D'Amato gave Pataki $3.5 million is an
attempt to remind people of the connection between the governor and
the less popular senator, who sponsored his 1994 race.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, late last year, the state Republican Party, not
D'Amato, transferred $3.1 million to Pataki's campaign. While the
party's formidable fund-raising machinery was largely built by
D'Amato and his former aide, Bill Powers, now the party chairman,
it could be argued that the governor has become the chief
fund-raiser for the party.
</P>
<P>
   On that count, Ragone insisted that Vallone was not mistaken,
even if D'Amato had not actually written a check to Pataki, and he
cited a March 1 New York Times article detailing the transfer from
the party to the governor. ``Three million dollars is
underestimating what the D'Amato machine has contributed to George
Pataki,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Vallone's claim skirted a more well-founded attack: that
Pataki is exploiting a loophole in the state law that limits
individual contributions to a gubernatorial campaign to $28,000.
Many people who had contributed the maximum, or close to it, also
made large contributions to the party, money that was then
transferred to Pataki's campaign. That allowed the governor legally
to collect, in some cases, double the limit from wealthy donors.

BEFORE DYING, DAUGHTER TELLS 911 OF POLICEMAN'S RAMPAGE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JIM YARDLEY and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a typical Friday, Officer Patrick J. Fitzgerald
would leave the 34th Precinct in Manhattan, drive 90 minutes home
to Orange County, and take his 7-year-old daughter, Ashley, to flag
football practice. He was the coach, and she was the only girl on
the team.
</P>
<P>
   But last Friday, Ashley Fitzgerald frantically dialed 911,
telling the dispatcher: ``My mommy is shot. She is going to die.''
</P>
<P>
   When state police officers arrived at the Fitzgeralds' two-story
log cabin six minutes later, they discovered a gruesome scene:
Fitzgerald had shot his wife, Leanne, as Ashley called for help.
Then he shot his 4-year-old son, Shane, as Ashley watched. Then he
shot Ashley.
</P>
<P>
   Then, finally, he called a desk sergeant at his precinct,
confessed to the murders, hung up the phone and shot himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a walk through hell,'' said Maj. Alan G. Martin, a
state police commander, describing the scene at the house.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, as Leanne Fitzgerald's family began to make funeral
arrangements, state police investigators said that her husband's
murderous rampage may have been set off by longstanding domestic
difficulties. ``We know they weren't getting along,'' he said.
``They were definitely having marital problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends and neighbors, while saying the couple were caring
parents, also told of a marriage with a history of problems. Last
summer, Mrs. Fitzgerald and the children moved out of the family
house in rural Greenville, N.Y., outside Middletown, N.Y., and into
an apartment. Friends said the couple reconciled about two months
later.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Schwartz, a family friend, recalled Mrs. Fitzgerald often
saying, ``I love my husband, but I don't like my husband.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Saturday in Middletown, Martin said Ashley
Fitzgerald called the state police dispatcher at 6 p.m. on Friday.
Three times, the dispatcher said, ``911, what's your emergency?''
before Ashley responded.
</P>
<P>
   Martin described Ashley as calm at times, near tears at others.
``They're fighting again,'' she told the dispatcher. ``My daddy is
trying to kill my mommy.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, a gunshot can be heard, Martin said, and Ashley says: ``My
mommy is shot. She is going to die.'' Troopers later found Mrs.
Fitzgerald, shot in the head, in an upstairs bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald apparently walked down the stairs and spotted his
son, Shane. ``Now, he's right near my younger brother,'' Ashley
told the dispatcher. ``He's only 4 years old.'' Martin said the
popping sound of a gunshot can again be heard on the tape.
</P>
<P>
   Within moments, Martin said, the telephone was hung up. At that
point, investigators believe Fitzgerald shot his daughter and then
called the 34th Precinct, reaching the desk sergeant on duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've shot my family,'' he told the desk sergeant. ``Now I'm
going to kill myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Fitzgerald used his own .38-caliber handgun,
not his service revolver. He picked up the bodies of his two
children and placed them side-by-side on a bed in a downstairs
bedroom. His own body was found beside them, as if they were all
asleep, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The shock caused by news of the slayings was compounded by the
contradictory image fellow officers and co-workers had of
Fitzgerald. A 13-year veteran who had recently been promoted, he
was described as a caring, involved father who, in addition to
Ashley's flag football team, also coached a youth soccer team.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir said Fitzgerald worked for the
Warrants Squad at the 34th Precinct and had been promoted about
three months ago to ``police officer special assignment.'' This
promotion left Fitzgerald's rank and duties unchanged, but gave him
a $1,500 annual pay increase.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, speaking at a news conference in Queens,
also expressed regret. ``It's a terrible tragedy of tremendous
dimensions, to see an entire family destroyed,'' the mayor said.
``Looking at his records as a police officer, there were not any
suggestions that something like this would happen. If anything, he
appears to have been a really excellent police officer.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In rural Greenville, an unincorporated hamlet of 3,200 people,
many of them city firefighters and police officers, stunned friends
and neighbors said that the Fitzgeralds had had marital troubles,
but Martin said there were had no police reports of domestic
violence in the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just crazy,'' said Joe O'Brien, a neighbor who is a city
firefighter. ``They were over here the day before, and the kids
were happy. There was no sign of stress.''
</P>
<P>
   Michele Cassidy, a regular baby sitter for Shane, said the
Fitzgeralds ``always had problems,'' adding, ``She had left a few
times but it was no big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 5 p.m. on Friday, Ms. Cassidy said, she spoke to
Mrs. Fitzgerald by telephone. She said Mrs. Fitzgerald was
concerned because her husband was late even though it was practice
night for the flag football squad.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Emanuele, another neighbor, said Mrs. Fitzgerald left her
husband in July 1997, moving into an apartment with the children.
However, the couple reconciled two months later.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she moved back in, supposedly she bought all new
furniture,'' said Ms. Emanuele. ``They were starting over. They
were doing it for the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Emanuele also added, ``Anybody who knew them knew they
were having some kind of problems.'' She described Fitzgerald as
particularly excited about his daughter's flag football team. ``I
never found him to be unpleasant,'' she said. ``I just found him to
be a very quiet man.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cassidy said that Mrs. Fitzgerald started a new job three
weeks ago with a mortgage company. Mrs. Fitzgerald was active in a
Protestant church, Ms. Cassidy said, but her husband was Roman
Catholic and the children attended a school run by the local
diocese.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said the couple moved to Orange County about nine years
ago; neighbors said they had come from Queens.

SLUMPING METS FALL BEHIND IN THE WILD-CARD RACE
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Will be updated after Cubs-Astros and Padres-Rockies
games.) 
(nk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For the last five days, the Mets controlled their
postseason hopes. But after Tom Glavine and an assortment of Braves
relievers shut them down here Saturday in a 4-0 loss, the Mets'
season _ and the National League wild-card race _ came down to the
Mets hoping the Cubs and Giants would lose.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets (88-73) have lost their last four games. Saturday's
loss dropped them a half-game behind both the Cubs and the Giants
in the wild-card race, before those teams played later. Now the
Mets face a must-win situation against the most successful National
League pitcher of this decade, Greg Maddux, with their flickering
wild-card hopes on the line.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are the Mets in danger of being swept by the Braves
this weekend; they are also perilously close to being swept out of
their season, as well. Al Leiter (17-6) did all he could to match
Glavine zero for zero for the first five innings. But Leiter, who
had escaped one bases-loaded jam in the fourth, could not repeat
the feat in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   And because the Mets could not score on Glavine on a
bases-loaded opportunity of their own, they were left waiting,
watching and hoping that the Cubs and the Giants would both lose,
too, to minimize the damage of yet another loss.
</P>
<P>
   It was a pitchers' duel from the start, as might have been
expected in a game featuring Cy Young Award candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter was perfect through three and a third innings, although
he did have trouble with the bottom of the order in the third.
Danny Bautista drilled a ball a couple feet outside the left-field
pole before flying out, and then both Tony Graffanino and Glavine
hit hard balls to left, Graffanino flying out to the track and
Glavine lining to Tony Phillips, who made a snow-cone catch.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine had more trouble with the Mets early on. Brian McRae, a
switch-hitter who always bats left-handed against the left-hander
Glavine, and Luis Lopez delivered back-to-back, two-out singles in
the second, but were stranded when Rey Ordonez lined to first. And
in the third, Edgardo Alfonzo singled with two outs and John Olerud
walked on four pitches, but Mike Piazza struck out.
</P>
<P>
   Both pitchers saved their best for bases-loaded situations,
however.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves loaded the bases with one out in the fourth on a
double by Gerald Williams, a four-pitch walk to Chipper Jones and
an infield single by Andres Galarraga. Galarraga's hit appeared to
hit him in the batter's box, which would have made it a foul.
Instead, Galarraga barely beat Piazza's throw to first, as the
Mets, who had left home uncovered, scrambled to get back to the
plate as Williams held at third.
</P>
<P>
   But Leiter retired Javy Lopez on an 0-1 foul-out to Olerud, then
struck out Andruw Jones on a 1-2 fastball that was high and
outside, two pitches after Jones barely missed at least a two-run
double with a foul drive down the left-field line.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was the Mets' turn to leave the bases loaded, something
they have been doing with great frequency the last few days. With
one out in the fifth, Leiter unexpectedly slammed a double over
Bautista's head in left (Leiter had only two extra-base hits in his
career, both coming this season). Phillips, who had batted
left-handed against Glavine his first two times up, switched and
worked a full-count walk.
</P>
<P>
   After Alfonzo struck out on a 2-2 pitch for the second out,
Olerud singled sharply to left as the third-base coach, Cookie
Rojas wisely held Leiter up at third. Up came Piazza, who was
14-for-32 with three home runs against Glavine before the day
began. The All-Star catcher hit Glavine's first pitch hard _ but
right at Williams in right. And the Mets had left three more
runners on base.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Mets, it turned out Glavine was on a pitch
count, after all. Manager Bobby Cox had insisted before the series
that both Glavine and Sunday's starter, Greg Maddux would be
pitching as if these were normal starts. But the Braves clinched
the best record in the National League on Friday night, and after
throwing 83 pitches in five innings Saturday, Glavine was given the
rest of the afternoon off to rest for his first playoff start.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Mets, Glavine's replacement, Denny Neagle,
is no slouch. Neagle, a 15-game winner this season, came on and set
the Mets down in order in the sixth. And unlike Cox, Mets Manager
Bobby Valentine had no such luxuries with his pitching staff, what
with the Mets fighting for a playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   That meant the Mets were going as long as they could with
Leiter, for better or for worse. And things turned ugly for the
tall left-hander in the sixth, when the Braves finally broke
through for three runs.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the inning was over, Leiter, who finished with 113
pitches, was done for the day _ and perhaps the season, which has
been the best of his career. Walt Weiss opened the sixth with a
double to left, before Williams worked a walk after falling behind
by 0-2 in the count. Leiter then fell behind Jones by 3-1 before
Jones could not check his swing as the count ran full. With the
runners going on the full-count pitch, Jones blooped a single to
center to score the game's first run, and Williams took third.
</P>
<P>
   After Galarraga walked, Leiter bore back to strike out Lopez.
But after a meeting at the mound with pitching coach Bob Apodaca,
Leiter surrendered an 0-1 double to Andruw Jones inside the
left-field line. And that was all for the Mets' Cy Young Award
candidate, who was replaced by Turk Wendell.
</P>
<P>
   It took Wendell only four pitches to end the threat, as he got
two ground balls. But Leiter had allowed three runs, three walks
and five hits in his five and a third innings.

JOE MILLER, 95, INDUSTRIALIST AND GEHRIG FRIEND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Ariz.)  (mk) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joe Miller's pal was born to play soccer, and he played it with
such flair that 80 years later Miller could raise the hairs on a
listener's neck simply describing his friend's powerful kick.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Miller, a Bronx native, got to know him in history
class at the old High School of Commerce in Manhattan, his pal, a
big German guy, was well on his way to being converted to football,
proving good enough to win a scholarship to Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was a pretty fair athlete himself, but baseball was his
sport, which is why Miller, a retired industrialist who was 95 when
he died on Sept. 3 in Tucson, Ariz., was remembered less for his
brilliant business career than for a high school friendship and the
day in 1917 when he and some of his high school teammates got to
talking about Miller's pal, Lou Gehrig, and it dawned on them that
if Gehrig was that good at soccer and football, then surely they
could teach him to play baseball.
</P>
<P>
   They did, too, and with such spectacular success that after
Miller, an affable man who amassed an impressive art collection and
became a benefactor of the University of Arizona, retired to Tucson
in 1972, he talked more about baseball than about his pioneering
work as an industrial chemist.
</P>
<P>
   It was not that Miller, a Columbia graduate who earned a
master's degree in chemical engineering from Yale and worked for du
Pont before starting his own industrial paint company, Pyrolac
Corp., in Hawthorn, N.J., was ashamed that he made a fortune with a
special protective coating for bathroom fixtures. Nor was he
ashamed that he made an even larger fortune developing a metallic
paint that made it possible for cars to blossom into a rainbow of
hues other than black.
</P>
<P>
   And he was certainly proud enough that he developed the lacquer
Jackie Kennedy applied to White House antiques and that a
heat-resistant coating he developed protected the Apollo spacecraft
on trips to the Moon.
</P>
<P>
   But for all his business success, Miller never for one moment
forgot that nothing was more important than baseball.
</P>
<P>
   A pitcher, Miller played for Columbia and was so impressive in
semi-pro ball that he was offered a contract by the Yankees. He
turned it down, partly because he wanted to concentrate on his
studies and partly because by the time he left high school, he had,
by his own gleeful account later, done about as much as he could
for the national pastime.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is true that Gehrig had played stickball as a kid, but
when he reached the Commerce annex on West 46th Street, baseball
was an alien sport.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Miller put it in an interview last year: ``Lou didn't
know how to play baseball, but we thought we'd teach him. He didn't
want to play at first, but after about a year, he picked it up
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Gehrig had natural power, teaching him the game was the
easy part. The trick was to get Gehrig, who did, after all, have a
storied tendency to stick with whatever he started, to take up
baseball in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   With Gehrig under old world pressure from his mother and feeling
his own dogged sense of responsibility to shun athletics and all
other extracurricular activities in favor of his accounting
studies, it took the combined wheedling of Miller, the other
Commerce players and the coach to persuade him to take his nose out
of his books and put his eye on the ball.
</P>
<P>
   (In the end it was his bookkeeping teacher, a baseball fan, who
did the trick, threatening to flunk him if he did not go out for
the team.)
</P>
<P>
   Rocky as he was at first, Gehrig, whose fielding skills were
still notoriously deficient when he joined the Yankees organization
in 1923, proved such a quick study and had such acute eyesight that
by the time Commerce won the New York City public school
championship in 1920 he was already being called the Babe Ruth of
high school baseball in New York.
</P>
<P>
   He added a national cachet to the sobriquet on June 26, 1920,
when, in a celebrated showdown at Cubs Park between Commerce and
the Chicago city champions, Lane Tech, Gehrig iced a 12-6 Commerce
victory with a towering grand slam home run in the ninth inning,
becoming the only high school player to knock one out of what is
now known as Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   (For all that, at a time when college baseball was an
afterthought, it was Gehrig's football prowess that landed him a
scholarship to Columbia.)
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who played semi-pro ball during his student years
against several baseball greats, including Satchel Paige, may not,
as he told his wife, have once struck out Babe Ruth, but his
friendship with Gehrig was real.
</P>
<P>
   He attended Gehrig's wedding, helped him pick out his first
house, was a frequent dugout guest during Gehrig's 2,130
consecutive game streak and was at Yankee Stadium for the stricken
Gehrig's famous ``luckiest man'' farewell in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   After his role in discovering and honing Gehrig's baseball
talents, it is understandable that Miller, who clearly had an eye
for quality, would be just as particular in his taste for women.
</P>
<P>
   After a long, high-spirited and persistent pursuit, Miller
finally found one worth keeping who was willing to take him and his
baseball memories to heart: a Tucson widow named Ruth Reed. She was
70 and he was 90 when they married five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   As his only survivor, she still has his most treasured
possession, the Bill Doak model baseball glove he got at Schultz
Sporting Goods when he was 14 and teaching Lou Gehrig how to play
baseball.

DEMOCRATS IN CONNECTICUT SEE TROUBLE IN NOVEMBER 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Unnerved by their gubernatorial candidate's
dismal poll ratings and President Clinton's political troubles, the
11 Connecticut Democrats running for statewide and federal office
held an emergency meeting with Sen. Christopher Dodd Saturday to
discuss how the party can avoid a disaster in the November
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Several national polls have shown that among the people who are
most likely to vote, Republican candidates have a solid edge over
Democrats. Connecticut Democrats face added peril because of the
falling fortunes of their candidate for governor, U.S. Rep. Barbara
Kennelly, who was 37 points behind Gov. John Rowland in a recent
poll. The state's Democratic leaders say they fear that the
combination of those two factors could result in a historic blowout
for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   So before candidates headed out for a warm day of fairgoing and
parade walking, Dodd summoned them for an unusual strategy session
at the state's Democratic Party headquarters. Dodd, a former
chairman of the Democratic National Committee, is running for a
fourth term but appears to have a comfortable lead over his
Republican challenger, Gary Franks, a former congressman from
Waterbury.
</P>
<P>
   Participants said Saturday's meeting, from which a reporter was
barred, was a combination of a revival and an encounter group. Most
of the candidates and their many staff members seemed to leave in a
chastened but determined mood. Some pointed to Clinton's continuing
improvement in polls, but one party strategist, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity, said Democrats were looking for realistic
ways to prevent rejection of Mrs. Kennelly from becoming ``a
tsunami that swamps the whole ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodd said he believed the governor's race would almost certainly
wind up closer than it looked now. ``I'm not trying to blow smoke
here,'' he said. ``I realize we've got a tough battle, and she
does. But we think we can create a possibility that this race gets
in the range of winnable. It's hard. Anyone who says otherwise is
deluding themselves. But at least we're trying to manufacture and
create an environment where that can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   As a reminder of what was at stake, the meeting took place
beneath a huge memorial sketch of Mrs. Kennelly's father, John
Bailey, who was the national Democratic chairman for seven years
and the state party chairman for 29 years. Mrs. Kennelly, who was
in Washington for a vote Saturday, joined the meeting by
speakerphone and gave an impassioned and optimistic report on her
campaign, saying she would continue to give it everything she had
for the remaining 39 days.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The state Democratic chairman, Edward Marcus, left in the middle
of the Democratic National Committee meeting in Washington to
return to Hartford for Saturday's session. Marcus urged Mrs.
Kennelly and the other candidates to be more aggressive about
pointing out their differences with their opponents instead of
simply discussing their own ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kennelly has been only indirect in her attacks on Rowland
in her advertisements and speeches. ``She has to talk about what a
chameleon John Rowland is _ the king of the flip-flops,'' Marcus
said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus served as the session's spirit chairman, proclaiming that
``a top-to-bottom win'' by the Democratic ticket was still
possible. During the meeting, officials decided to focus on towns
and precincts that are the most reliably Democratic, and blitz
those areas with phone calls, mail and visits. The campaigns also
resolved to distribute the best-known candidates throughout the
state instead of attending events together, to keep local
Democratic workers energized.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd, speaking on the crisis engulfing the president, said he
wanted to convince voters that however the impeachment matter is
resolved, the issues of health care, education and crime would
remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that this presidential thing is having a
dampening effect on some people,'' Dodd said. ``We want to
challenge Democrats across the country: Whatever else they may be
angry about or down about in the short term, they need to think
about the long term.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodd already was following Marcus' advice in his own race.
Despite Dodd's wide lead, he began airing harsh television
advertisements over the weekend denouncing his opponent, Franks.
``I always assume I'm at least one vote behind,'' Dodd said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd's aides say he has always run aggressive campaigns, and
that the senator was simply responding to an attack ad by Franks
that began running on Tuesday. ``Democrats have learned that even
when you have a decent lead, you don't let a negative be unanswered
for,'' said Rob Engel, Dodd's campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   The ad by Franks showed a black-and-white, slow-motion clip of
Dodd, then an ever-growing pile of money. ``Chris Dodd says he
supports a balanced budget,'' the ad says. It goes on to discuss
several votes by Dodd and then concluded, ``Yet while voting new
taxes on us, Dodd sponsored a 40 percent pay raise for himself.
Chris Dodd _ taxes for us, pay raises for him. It's time for a
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodd's campaign said the pay raise was part of a bill to limit
outside income for members of Congress.

RACE GOES ON FOR PAIR WHO NEARLY LOST THEIR LIVES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ The sideburns on Josh Hall's brush-cut are
graying now. And the smile lines in the corner of Isabelle
Autissier's blue eyes are etched a little deeper. But the same
tenacity that allowed them to overcome losing their sailboats at
sea _ and nearly their lives _ in a round-the-world race four years
ago has brought them back to the starting line again.
</P>
<P>
   Both in new 60-foot sailboats, Hall and Autissier are among 14
skippers starting out from here Saturday in the Around Alone, a
26,000-mile single-handed competition formerly known as the BOC
Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Two competitors, Neil Hunter of Australia and Viktor Yazykov of
Russia, decided at the last minute to delay their start a day or so
because they said they were not ready. Hunter broke the mast on his
40-foot boat, Paladin II, while sailing it here from Australia. He
was only able to replace it two days ago. Yazykov and his
40-footer, Wind of Change Russia, arrived here late and has been
playing catch-up ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The fleet of 40-to-60-foot yachts are apt to be dodging
hurricanes on the way to their first stop in Cape Town. With eight
months of racing ahead, including three stops along the way,
anything can happen. But excitement and anticipation were more
common on the docks early Saturday than fear and loathing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have fully come to realize that this is what I love doing,''
the 36-year-old Hall said. ``You hope that the disaster that struck
in the last race was one of those one-off things. Certainly, for
the first five or six days afterwards, I was having trouble
sleeping. But you put things in perspective over time.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1994-95 race, radio and satellite contact with race
headquarters here guided Alan Nebauer, a fellow competitor, to
Hall's stricken yacht in the mid-Atlantic minutes before the yacht
sank. Hall surmises that his 60-foot yacht hit a submerged object.
</P>
<P>
   For Autissier, now 41 and the only woman in the race, major gear
breakdowns struck twice in 1994-95 on the way from Cape Town to
Sydney. Picked up from her crippled boat by an Australian
helicopter rescue team, Autissier took a year to regain her
strength. She has since made peace with a lawless sea by building
PRB, another 60-footer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through some things _ some good, some very bad,'' she
said Wednesday. ``When I went through the bad things, I learned
that I could keep going and not give up. I did what I could, and I
was not in despair even though I knew it was a very serious
situation. It gave me confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Weighty as the episode was, Autissier, like many of the other
solo sailors here, seems to have an uncanny ability to ignore fear.
Autissier will pack a bottle of Champagne for dumping overboard at
the Equator for King Neptune, the god of the sea that she sees as
the imaginary protector of all sailors.
</P>
<P>
   Giovanni Soldini, the 32-year-old Italian whose similarly
designed 60-foot sailboat, Fila, is one of Autissier's closest
rivals, has chosen to drink his spirits: ``I must have one glass of
wine each evening with my meal.''
</P>
<P>
   But he is sobered by the death last spring of Andreas Romanelli,
a sailing colleague who was lost overboard during a trans-Atlantic
passage on Fila. For weeks, Soldini was unsure that he could
continue with his plans for the Around Alone.
</P>
<P>
   As one of seven boats in Class I, all 60-footers, Soldini is
among an inner circle of five with a reasonable chance at winning.
All five yachts are designed by Groupe Finot, a French naval
architecture firm known for its innovation in Open Class,
round-the-world race boats.
</P>
<P>
   Autissier, with PRB, and Soldini, with Fila, have the most
experience and miles on their yachts. But Hall has built a newer
Finot design, which he has named Gartmore Investment Management,
the same as his last boat. Two newcomers to the race, Mike Golding
of England, skipper of Group 4, and Marc Thiercelin of France,
skipper of Somewhere, also chose Finot as their architect.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the Finot yachts are built with ungainly looking
rotating masts supported by outriggers on either side instead of
conventional shrouds. The rig allows for better sail shape, and
purportedly, quicker speed. Canting keels, which swing from one
side of the boat to the other to control leeway upwind, are also
Finot creations. All five boats are wide, about 18 feet, and low to
the water.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about safety are prompting designers to come up with
new ways to keep the boats afloat should they capsize and stay
upside down like an overturned saucer. Bulkhead air bladders, stern
balloons with compressed air cartridges, and automatic water
ballast systems have been developed in case the worst happens.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the technology, however, most experts agree that the
race comes down to talent and experience. ``This race is really
about how many smarts you've got,'' said Golding.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At 37, Thiercelin is considered a wild card given his top
showings in French single-handed competition. His campaign,
sponsored over three years by La Redoute, a French mail-order
company, is flush with $3.5 million in ocean-race funding.
</P>
<P>
   But Autissier remains the top choice. Her record includes a
seventh-place finish in the 1990-91 BOC race.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the logical favorite because she smoked all the guys on
the first leg in 1994, but then lost because of tragedy in the
second leg,'' said Jean-Pierre Mouligne, French skipper of the
50-foot Cray Valley, a top boat in Class II. ``She's also the heart
favorite because she's a woman. This is her third attempt, and it
should be her race.''
</P>
<P>
   Autissier said that the unsettled weather is apt to reduce the
area of Atlantic Ocean trade winds, which sailors count on for a
consistent breeze within the first two weeks at sea. Taking the
long way round, while probably safer, is also very likely to delay
the passage to Cape Town. Hurricanes along the way may also
lengthen a section of doldrums, a band of mid-ocean calm that
sailors tend to dread because it slows them down.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one seems particularly worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am really doing this for pleasure,'' Autissier said. ``I
still know that a small percentage is really hard, and that there
is something in between. But there are also wonderful times.''

FOUR ACCUSED OF INVADING HOMES AND TORTURING VICTIMS FOR CASH 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After several incidents this month in which armed men
wearing masks burst into homes in Queens and tortured the people
living there until they gave up their cash and valuables, the
police charged four men Friday with the well-planned robberies.
</P>
<P>
   The police said the robbers paid for tips on the street about
business owners who had recently made large sums of money. They
stalked their victims before invading their homes and, in some
cases, burning them with irons or scalding them, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Though the men are charged in only four robberies, Lt. William
Nevins, commanding officer of the Queens robbery squad, said that
they were suspected in several others in Brooklyn and Long Island
over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   The first hint of the gang came on Sept. 11 in South Ozone Park,
Nevins said, when four men entered a two-unit apartment building
belonging to a bodega owner.
</P>
<P>
   He said the men broke down the front door of the upstairs
apartment around 5 p.m. After they used extension cords to tie up a
36-year-old woman, her 15-year-old daughter and seven men who were
living there, the armed robbers took $300 and some jewelry. Then
they forced the woman and her daughter down the stairs to the first
floor.
</P>
<P>
   The robbers were looking for the landlord, a 41-year-old bodega
owner, the police said. They had been told by a paid informer that
the man had won $85,000 in a South American lottery, the police
said. After the robbers found the man inside the first-floor
apartment, he pleaded with them, saying they had mistaken him for
someone else, the police said, but that only angered them.
</P>
<P>
   When the bodega owner failed to produce the money, one of the
robbers hit him in the head with a pistol, the police said. Over
what became a two-hour ordeal, they also burned him on the back
with a hot iron and forced him to stand in a tub of scalding water,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevins said the men fled with jewelry and about $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Six days later, apparently acting on another tip, the robbers
waited for a 12-year-old boy to leave his apartment in Elmhurst for
school, the police said, then forced him inside, where they tied up
his 47-year-old mother with hanger wire.
</P>
<P>
   The police said the robbers believed that the woman, who owned a
restaurant in Corona, had recently taken home a large amount of
cash. The police said that when she failed to hand it over, the men
forced both the woman and her son into a tub of scalding water and
threatened to slice her face with a knife.
</P>
<P>
   They left with $1,100, some stereo equipment and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   The robbers attacked again on Sept. 22, the police said,
breaking into a woman's apartment in Jackson Heights, then burning
her on the back with an iron when she failed to give them money.
The robbers left after taking an undetermined amount of money.
</P>
<P>
   The police said they were not releasing the names of the
victims, because of the violent nature of the crime and to protect
their families. In all of the cases, the victims' burns were
extensive enough to require hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
   The police identified the suspects as Edwin Nunez, 19, Mailky
Mota, 21, and Miguel Thomas, 24, all of Brooklyn, and Omar Taveras,
22, of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Nevins said the evidence included three guns, one of which was
found inside a hidden compartment in the wheel well of a Ford
Taurus. The compartment, which opened only if the car's defroster
and turn signal were in use, also held a crowbar and a ski mask, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were pretty organized,'' he said. ``They picked their
victims carefully, used code names during the robberies and went to
the trouble of having a trap in the car. They didn't want to slip
up.''

REAL ESTATE: SAFETY, AS WELL AS STYLE, COUNTS IN LOBBY
REDECORATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When a co-op or condominium decides to redecorate a
lobby, questions of design usually take precedence. Safety issues,
such as the flammability of carpeting, draperies and other
furnishings, are sometimes neglected. But co-op and condo lawyers
say that a careful consideration of those issues is not only
advisable but is required by law.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are at least two good reasons for complying with
flammability regulations,'' said James Samson, a Manhattan co-op
lawyer. ``One is because landlords and co-op and condominium boards
are responsible for complying with regulations concerning tenants'
safety. And the other is that if you have a fire in a common area
filled with flammable materials, just watch how fast it goes up. It
can turn a lobby into an inferno in a matter of seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   New York City Fire Department regulations have long required
those responsible for public buildings like theaters, restaurants
and museums to insure that combustible materials in their buildings
_ things like draperies, curtains and decorative plants and trees,
but not carpeting _ have been treated with fire-retardant
chemicals. In June 1996, those regulations were amended to include
common areas of multiple dwellings.
</P>
<P>
   James Hansen, a spokesman for the Fire Department, said that
regulations require all combustible materials in public areas of
buildings to be certified as flameproof by a person who has been
issued a New York City Fire Department certificate of fitness.
``And we do enforce the law when we find a violation,'' he said,
adding that an initial violation can result in a $1,000 fine and
subsequent offenses carry a fine of up to $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Molla, the owner of Cleantex Process Co., a Manhattan
cleaning and flameproofing company, said that many residential
landlords and co-op and condominium boards appear to be unaware of
the change in the law. Molla, who holds a certificate of fitness
from the Fire Department, said that his company had been
flameproofing draperies and curtains in theaters and restaurants,
as well as in some co-ops and condominiums, since 1928. He said he
had not seen an increase in the number of calls he gets from
residential buildings since the law was changed two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Molla said that according to the law, all combustible materials
in covered buildings must be certified as flameproof once a year.
To meet the standards, he said, the material must either be
inherently flameproof or chemically treated to make it that way.
</P>
<P>
   An untreated fabric will burn when exposed to flame or extreme
heat and continue burning after the flame or heat is removed, he
said; a flameproof fabric will stop burning when the ignition
source is removed.
</P>
<P>
   Fabrics that are inherently flameproof, he said, are generally
manufactured that way. In most cases, he said, the flameproofing is
permanent.
</P>
<P>
   All combustible fabrics are tested by exposing a small portion
to a flame and seeing if the fabric continues to burn when the
flame is removed. Fabrics that fail the test must be treated and
retreated on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our treatment usually lasts three to five years,'' Molla said,
adding that in addition to requiring recertification every year,
Fire Department regulations require retreatment once every three
years or whenever the fabric has been laundered or dry-cleaned.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, Molla said, when his company is hired by a co-op or
condominium to flameproof curtains or draperies in a lobby, he will
suggest removing the items and then cleaning and treating them at
his factory.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you spray the treatment on dirty fabric you end up with
streaks and smudges,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, Molla said, treatment is relatively inexpensive.
``It depends on the size of the lobby and the number of drapes and
curtains,'' he said. ``But an average building usually runs about
$500 to $600.''
</P>
<P>
   Molla added that boards should always ask to see a flameproofing
company's certificate of fitness. ``There are companies out there
without certificates that will come in, test the fabric, and then
just sell you the flameproofing treatment, saying you can save
money by spraying it on yourself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, is inadvisable for two reasons. First, he said,
some fabrics, such as velvet, can be permanently damaged if they
are not treated properly.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Molla said, the Fire Department will accept
certifications only from a contractor holding a certificate of
fitness. Self-treatment, even if done properly, is legally invalid.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to insuring that draperies and curtains are
flameproof, boards should also make sure that carpeting in lobbies
and hallways complies with existing regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that many of the common-area and hallway carpet
installations in Manhattan's residential buildings are in violation
of city codes,'' said Marilyn Sygrove, president of Sygrove
Associates, a Manhattan interior design company.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sygrove explained that under the New York City Building
Code, only 100 percent wool carpeting can be installed in lobby
areas, exit passageways and convenience stairs of buildings
constructed after Dec. 6, 1968 _ the date of the adoption of the
current code. In interior hallways, she said, carpeting that is at
least 80 percent wool can be used, as well as nylon carpeting,
provided that the nylon is installed properly.
</P>
<P>
   The reason wool is preferable, she said, is because it is
inherently flame-retardant. Nylon is not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, apartment buildings have used nylon because it
supposedly lasts longer,'' she said. ``But if nylon carpet is laid
atop a pad that is attached to the floor only around its perimeter,
pockets of air can be trapped underneath. And when oxygen gets
under nylon, it becomes highly flammable.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, she said, the only legal way to install nylon
carpeting is to glue the entire carpet directly to the floor, or to
glue a carpet pad to the floor and then glue the carpet to the pad.
</P>
<P>
   Wool, on the other hand, can be installed over a pad without any
gluing by nailing tack-imbedded wood strips _ called ``tackless'' _
around the perimeter of the area to be carpeted.
</P>
<P>
   Herb Frank, the owner of Quality Carpet in Brooklyn, said that
in addition to being inherently fire-retardant, wool is preferable
to nylon for other reasons. ``Basically, wool looks newer longer,''
Frank said. ``It has better detail, clearer patterns and beautiful
color and clarity.''
</P>
<P>
   And while wool generally costs about $10 a square yard more than
nylon, the difference is reduced to about $4 a square yard when the
cost of installing nylon according to the strict requirements is
taken into consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about an overall price difference of about 10
percent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Samson, the lawyer, said that co-op and condominium boards in
buildings built before the 1968 change in the law _ and not
technically subject to the current requirements _ should follow
them anyway if they are considering installing new carpeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because you don't have to do something doesn't mean you
shouldn't,'' he said, adding that failure to address a potential
problem _ even without the legal requirement to do so _ can result
in expanded liability.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the city is saying is that the wrong carpeting in a
common area can be dangerous,'' he said. ``And if it's dangerous in
a fairly new building, it's going to be dangerous in an old one
too.''

OUTDOORS: THE PONIES OF CHINCOTEAGUE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.)  (mk) 
 By THOMAS BRANDT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHINCOTEAGUE, Va. _ Some 50 feet away, the palomino stared me
down and, seeing nothing in my hands to mooch, she walked off
through the salt marsh toward the sand dunes in Chincoteague
National Wildlife Refuge, with water spraying at each hoof step.
The white cattle egret on her back rode quietly along since these
semiwild horses are a buffet table for bug-eating birds.
</P>
<P>
   However, this symbiotic relationship between egrets and horses
is the exception. While the ponies have an almost mystical draw on
tourists, who are now economically critical to the survival of this
tiny seaside town, in the refuge their trample of ground-nesting
birds, the eating of plant life critical to barrier islands, soil
compaction and other negative impacts of these nonnative horses are
of growing concern to scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Here on one of the East Coast's wildest barrier islands some 150
feral horses run free. In late July, thousands of people come for
the annual Pony Penning festival, where many bid to buy the
captured colts. Since 1924, the saltwater cowboys of the
Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Department have saddled up their own
horses, rounded up the island's scattered herds and swum them
across Assateague channel to the town of Chincoteague. There, the
yearlings are sold to raise firefighting funds so the town will
never again be nearly lost to fire as it was in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being the inspiration for ``Misty of Chincoteague,''
Marguerite Henry's 1947 children's book classic about two orphans
drawn to a pony named Misty, the refuge is also a critically
important major Eastern flyway. Some 1.4 million people are drawn
here each year by the grazing ponies, the beach, birds, surf
fishing, crabs and clamming. But they often go away with much more,
a new appreciation of America's once-common wildfowl and the
commitment of the National Park Service to protect this refuge.
More than 300 varieties of migratory birds grace these lands in
various seasons of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, however, tension has grown. As the nation's
wild habitat shrinks, biologists and environmentalists are
increasingly concerned that the nonnative horses at Chincoteague,
and several other East Coast barrier islands, will further damage
the land and kill off endangered birds and other species. The
horses' main food is marsh and dune grass which are critical to the
islands' ecological stability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that lives and breeds in the salt marsh will be
damaged by foraging horses,'' said William Dunson, professor
emeritus of biology at Penn State. ``You don't want nonnative
species to be present; you never know what their impact will be. If
you wanted to bring horses out to this refuge for the first time,
they would never allow it.'' Research and argument are still under
way as to what should be the environmentally acceptable horse
population on this island refuge of some 10,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Lore has it that the horses came from two different sources some
300 years ago: The first horses perhaps swam ashore from Spanish
galleons, wrecked off the coast; better documentation shows that
Eastern Shore planters put the horses on the barrier island to save
the cost of both building fences on their own land and paying
English taxes on the herd.
</P>
<P>
   The horses are often called wild ponies, though neither term is
accurate. They are not native nor completely wild, and are thus
feral horses, meaning they evolved from domesticated animals. And
the endearing pony term is used because the horses are small
because of the strains of the saltwater habitat.
</P>
<P>
   Those in the middle of the debate over how many horses are too
many for the island include John Schroer, refuge manager. ``When I
first came here in '89, the firefighters were getting about $350
for each foal they sold,'' he said. ``This year they sold nearly 90
and averaged more than $1,700 each. If there was an effort to cut
the herd size, there would be a tremendous outcry.''
</P>
<P>
   As to the government-mandated herd size of 150, Schroer said,
``We can be fairly assured there's not a lot of environmental
damage.'' Still, Chincoteague's topography is unique and, as Dunson
said, quite vulnerable. The refuge has wide beaches backed by low
dunes which yield to extensive salt marshes. There are also large
areas of pine and oak and freshwater ponds, and more than 2,600
acres of shallow, freshwater moist soil to maximize the refuge's
appeal to waterfowl. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the blue-collar town of Chincoteague, which you must pass
through to reach the refuge across Assateague channel bridge, the
controversy is not about the environment but down-home economics.
This village once thrived on commercial fishing, but as that trade
declined, the ponies began drawing more and more tourists. ``Misty
of Chincoteague,'' and the 1961 film of the book, breathed new life
into the town and a protection from poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Chincoteague remains more a village than a resort. Here
you forget about rubber-stamp subdivisions and resort sprawl.
Chincoteague is a blend of ponies, crabs, decoy carvers, wildfowl
and families, with an ocean running through it. While a case can be
made for shrinking the horse herd below 150, elimination would be
tantamount to burning down the town.
</P>
<P>
   So an unprecedented deal has been cut between the Chincoteague
Volunteer Fire Department and the Fish and Wildlife Service. A
special use permit allows the fire department to maintain the
150-horse herd on the federal refuge land under certain conditions.
These include a twice-a-year roundup by the fire department to
allow for veterinarian examinations and vaccinations, which are
also paid for by the department. Also, fencing through the woods
now keeps the horses off the beaches and dunes, protecting the
plant life that stabilizes these areas. Fencing also keeps the
horses from the roads, limiting the number of ponies hit by cars to
one or two a year (and the number of tourists bitten by ponies).
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at visitation as a challenge,'' added Schroer, the
refuge director. ``How can we let that many people in _ 1.4 million
a year _ and keep it a refuge? Still, it is a great opportunity to
educate people, and many leave here as great new advocates for
wildlife.'' &QL;

A FATHER-SON UNION HELPS RAMAPO TO SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By GRANT GLICKSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three years ago, Greg Toal was forced to make the
hardest decision of his young life. He had to choose between family
and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't want to leave my friends and my school,'' said
Toal, who was a 14-year-old sophomore at the time. ``I decided to
stay at Ramapo.''
</P>
<P>
   So rather than following his older brother Mike _ a star
offensive and defensive back _ and transferring to Hackensack where
their father, Greg Sr., was the head coach, Greg Jr. opted to
remain at Ramapo High School in Franklin Lakes, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   It could have created hard feelings in a less reasonable family,
but not in this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted it to be his decision,'' said Greg Sr., who began
building Hackensack's program in 1990. ``I knew that he would have
changed his mind if I would have pressured him. But I told him,
`Don't do it for me. Do it for yourself.'''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Mike Toal moved onto William Smith College, and
Greg Sr., who guided the Hackensack Comets to five consecutive
North Jersey Section 1 Group 4 titles, resigned as the head coach
of Hackensack and signed on with Ramapo as an assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was concerned about him becoming an assistant coach after
being the head man all those years,'' said Greg Jr., now a
17-year-old senior. ``But then I realized that he didn't mind
leaving Hackensack. He just wanted to coach me. That's all he
really cared about.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ramapo, the decisions made by father and son could not have
been diagrammed any better. Greg Jr., a signee of Boston College,
has rushed for 3,943 yards and 68 touchdowns. As a defensive back,
Toal has three interception returns for touchdowns. Coach Toal's
knowledge and experience has proved to be invaluable in practice,
prep sessions and on game days.
</P>
<P>
   Ramapo, (2-0) after Friday night's 56-0 victory against Pascack
Valley (1-1), has not lost a game since father and son were united
on the Raiders football field in 1997. After Toal rushed for 256
yards and 4 touchdowns Friday night, the Toals are 13-0 together.
Of course, the presence of Chris Simms, the nation's top-rated
signal-caller and son of former Giants' quarterback Phil Simms, has
certainly helped Ramapo's winning percentage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've witnessed over the last two years a great father-and-son
relationship,'' said Ramapo Coach Mike Miello. ``There is
absolutely no animosity. When they are on the field, it's
coach-player. When they go home, it's father-son. Exactly the way
it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Toals on board last season, the Ramapo Raiders managed
to wrest away Hoboken's three-year hold on the North Jersey Section
1 Group 3 title. The Raiders defeated Hoboken, 21-14 in overtime,
to claim their first championship since 1993. The victory snapped
the Red Wings' 38-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most exciting finishes in New Jersey State playoff
history, Greg Jr. went from hero to goat back to hero again in the
final minutes of play. After rushing 27 times for 249 yards and a
touchdown to help Ramapo take a 14-7 lead late in the fourth
quarter, Toal fumbled away the game-tying touchdown with 2 minutes
20 seconds remaining. It was Toal's third fumble of the day. Ramapo
later tied the game, and Toal managed to redeem himself in
overtime, knocking down the last pass of the game in the end zone
to preserve the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I fumbled that ball I was so down,'' Toal recalled. ``I
went back to my father as I always do and he told me: `Don't worry
about it. Stay up. No big deal.' It was a great feeling being able
to help the team after blowing it.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Toal was able to assist the team at all _ let
alone perform at such a high level _ was a testament to his
courage, strength and work ethic. Toal had strained the medial
collateral ligament in his left knee the week before the
championship game. He did not practice until late in the week and
his availability was in question up until game time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that Greg knows what it takes to be
successful,'' said Coach Toal, who has started all three of his
sons as seventh-graders on a strict exercise regimen that entails
wind sprints and resistance training. The youngest Toal, Brian, 13,
is a fullback on his junior high school team. ``Greg realized early
on that if he worked hard and put the time in, a lot of great
things would happen. It was his choice to make.''

REAL ESTATE: PAYING THE ESTATE TAX WITHOUT SELLING THE FAMILY
FARM 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SUSAN DOUZE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ Estate taxes _ both federal and state _ have
historically been a threat to intergenerational ownership of family
farms and ranches. The sons and daughters of land owners have often
been unable to find the cash to pay estate taxes due on farmland
that has greatly appreciated in market value over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, there was some sense of gratification among farmers
and ranchers in Oklahoma this year when the state joined
neighboring states in enacting a law that eases state estate taxes,
especially for smaller farms and ranches.
</P>
<P>
   But with federal laws still regarded as a threat to longterm
family farming, landowners who hope to sustain family ownership in
the next generation and beyond are putting their hopes in astute
estate planning, not the relaxation of estate taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've watched 15 to 20 customers close down,'' said Rodd
Moesel, who owns American Plant Products and Services here, which
sells commercial greenhouse equipment. ``They didn't have the cash
to put up and once they reduced the size of the property to pay
taxes it no longer was a viable economic entity.''
</P>
<P>
   Moesel also heads a statewide coalition of about 20 farm, ranch
and business groups _ including the Oklahoma Farm Bureau, Oklahoma
Farmers Union, State Chamber of Commerce and the Oklahoma Business
Council _ that is dedicated to tax reform.
</P>
<P>
   All its neighboring states _ Texas, Kansas, Arkansas, Missouri
and New Mexico _ have acted to ease the problem by modifying their
state estate tax. They have chosen to peg their state's tax at a
level no greater than the amount that the federal government allows
as a tax credit for the payment of a state estate tax as part of
the calculation of the federal tax that is due.
</P>
<P>
   Currently 33 states have adopted this system, becoming what the
tax lawyers call ``pickup'' states. Ten of these states have taken
the step within the last six years. Kansas became the latest
convert in May.
</P>
<P>
   That left Oklahoma as a ``pocket of overtaxation,'' Moesel said.
But this year the Legislature acted. As part of a $104 million tax
relief package, it raised the minimum level of farm value on which
a state estate tax is due, and made other adjustments to bring its
tax system more in line with neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
   The changes will mostly benefit smaller estates, typically less
than $625,000 in value, where no federal estate tax is due. Prior
to the enactment in 1987 of the Tax Reform Act, an estate below
that amount in value would still have paid an Oklahoma tax of as
much as $17,725. The state tax will be phased out in 2006.
</P>
<P>
   But for larger estates in which farm property forms a major
element in the valuation, the basic problem remains, farmer
representatives maintain. The federal estate tax rate is 55 percent
for the amount of an estate's value over $3 million (based on all
assets, including property, minus liabilities such as
administrative expenses and fees).
</P>
<P>
   For estates valued between $625,000 and $3 million, the tax rate
is on a sliding scale starting at 37 percent. In coming years, the
threshold at which estate taxes start will rise gradually from
$625,000 until it reaches $1 million by 2006.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for farmers and ranchers is that the appraised value
of their land may call for heirs to produce far more cash to pay
taxes than the working farm can generate. It becomes necessary to
sell land to pay taxes. If too much acreage is sold, there's too
little left to make a living. Sometimes, remedies that harm the
land, like clear-cutting timber, are a last resort to pay the tax
bill.
</P>
<P>
   For estate tax purposes, farms and ranches are appraised by
comparing them with similar properties in the region. Worth can
vary wildly with the economy. Challenges by Internal Revenue
Service appraisers to the valuations made on estate-tax filings are
common. On a multimillion dollar farm or ranch, a squabble over $1
million in an appraisal can translate into $400,000 to $500,000 in
additional estate taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's worth fighting for,'' said Henry Will, a lawyer with
the Tulsa firm of Conner &AMP; Winters. ``But it's a swearing match.
You can go to court. You need an attorney, an appraiser and a good
accountant. If you're cash strapped, as a lot of farm and ranch
families are, you may not be able to afford to.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Will gave the hypothetical example of a northeastern Oklahoma
dairy farmer who over 20 years bought 4,000 acres of land at an
average price of $350 an acre for a total of $1.4 million. He made
$600,000 in improvements, including roads, fences, barns and silos
to store grain.
</P>
<P>
   Because the entire estate was left to his wife through joint
tenancy and a simple will, there was no federal or estate tax at
his death. But when his wife died shortly thereafter, the estate
was appraised at $3.5 million. Federal estate tax, at the 40
percent rate, was $1,134,550. State estate tax, before reform, was
an additional $229,200.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are his kids going to pay those taxes and keep the farm?''
Will asked.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Payne, a lawyer whose family owns ranches in Osage
County, said that that he knows of 100,000 acres of family-owned
land in the county that has been sold off to corporations over the
last 10 years to pay estate taxes. In ranch country, it's
considered rude to banter about the number of acres owned and how
many head of cattle graze them. But for a rancher, it takes at
least $1 million in land and equipment _ some would say as much as
$2.5 million _ to ``make a respectable living,'' said Frederick
Drummond, 66, a third-generation cattle rancher in Osage County,
who plans to keep his land in his family.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of heavy estate taxes has led farmers and ranchers to put
heavy emphasis on estate planning.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are technical laws, but they can be very beneficial,''
said Will, the Tulsa lawyer. Basically, he said, by using gifting
techniques and available credits, a $5 million ranch or farm
property can pass to children tax free.
</P>
<P>
   One tax-avoidance technique that is increasingly used is called
a disclaimer: after a woman's husband dies, leaving an estate of
more than $3 million to his widow, she disclaims their $500,000
house. It therefore goes to the next heir as a trust.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the trust, the widow would be allowed to live
in the house, or the house could be sold, allowing the widow to
collect income from investments from the proceeds of the sale. When
she dies, the couple's children pay $295,000 less than they would
have paid without the disclaimer.
</P>
<P>
   Also useful is Section 2032A of the tax code, said John Mee Jr.,
an Oklahoma City lawyer. Under this provision, farmland that the
heirs continue to work as farmland can be assessed as farmland
rather than at the higher assessment that would result from a
valuation based on the land's ``highest and best use.'' When
farmland is surrounded by new housing developments, the
highest-and-best-use appraisal can be disastrous for the
continuation of farming. Other techniques include making use of the
maximum gift allowable each year under the federal tax rules _
$10,000 to each individual.
</P>
<P>
   When he's not on horseback working the herd just like his
grandfather or mending the same family fences, Drummond toils to
beat what he calls the ``death tax.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I make those allowable $10,000 gifts every year and I buy life
insurance,'' Drummond said, explaining that his son can use it to
pay the ``death tax.'' ``I come from sons and daughters of the
soil. I work the soil because I want to. I want my son to have the
chance to do the same.''

BIG PLAYS HELP BUCKNELL DEFEAT COLUMBIA

<TEXT>
<P>
   LEWISBURG, Pa. _ All the momentum that Columbia carried from its
upset victory over Harvard last week dissolved in one minute
Saturday at Bucknell. An interception that led to a Bucknell
touchdown late in the first half and a 93-yard kickoff return for a
touchdown to begin the second half helped turn Columbia's 14-3
cushion into a 27-20 defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big plays in the kicking game against good teams are hard to
overcome, and we couldn't overcome it today,'' Columbia Coach Ray
Tellier said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Lions managed to tie the game late in the third quarter at
17-17 on Sam Warren's 23-yard field goal. But the Bison (3-1) drove
58 yards early in the fourth quarter to set up a 40-yard field goal
by Ross Coleman to make it 20-17.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the final blow. Columbia's Avery Moseley, one of the
cornerbacks filling in for Chris Tillotson and Andre Ogundare, who
were suspended for disciplinary reasons, had played brilliantly,
intercepting two passes. But with 5 minutes 52 seconds left and the
Lions trailing 20-17, Moseley bit on receiver Ron Rockett's fake to
the sideline. Rockett cut back straight ahead without any defender
on him, and quarterback Don McDowell lobbed the ball to him for a
game-clinching 32-yard touchdown pass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``On third-and-5, you have to take a chance,'' Moseley said. ``I
was looking for them to get to the sticks.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A 35-yard field goal by Warren, who came in early in the first
quarter after Neal Kravitz pulled a muscle in his hip, made it
27-20, but the Lions' final drive died at the Bucknell 35-yard line
when quarterback Paris Childress lofted a rainbow into the end zone
that was tipped away from receiver David Holmes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Childress completed 19-of-37 passes for 247 yards, 123 of those
yards going to Armand Dawkins. Dawkins' 49-yard touchdown reception
in the first quarter gave Columbia a 7-3 lead. The Lions widened
that to 14-3 when Jason Bivens' 1-yard run capped a 14-play,
53-yard drive. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We had established good rhythm on that drive,'' Childress
said. ``But it's something we should have done all day.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the Lions' next drive, Childress threw a short pass that was
bobbled by Lendell Thompson and flew into the hands of Bucknell's
Shawn Redd, and McDowell soon followed with a 17-yard touchdown
pass to Rockett. Jabu Powell then started the second half by
fielding Warren's kickoff at the 7, turning upfield to the 25,
cutting to the outside and sprinting untouched into the end zone.

 &HT;    Referee files protest against Bean promoter
 &HT;    By Chris Freeman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Ohio _ Vaughn Bean's promoter has said he plans to
file a protest against referee Brian Garry over his officiating of
Bean's championship bout against Evander Holyfield last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But Garry has beaten him to the punch and already filed his own
official protest against the promoter, Butch Lewis, for his conduct
during the fight, the president of the International Boxing
Federation said.
</P>
<P>
   IBF President Robert W. Lee said he has received Garry's letter
of protest. He said he has been told by Lewis that he would also
file a protest against Garry.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has until Oct. 2 to file his protest and said he planned
on filing it early next week.
</P>
<P>
   Lee will convene a 10-member executive committee to hear the
protest from Garry, Lewis or their representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they've been heard, then we can render a decision,'' Lee
said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Lee was present at the fight Saturday, he elected not to
comment on the protests until the executive committee had met.
</P>
<P>
   Garry's protest, filed with the IBF and the Georgia State Boxing
Commission, alleges Lewis verbally berated him during and after the
fight and physically confronted him in the ring after the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God we didn't have a riot or something like that,''
Garry said. ``He was trying to intimidate me. He held on to the
ring ropes, was up on the apron swearing at me from Round 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis did not dispute yelling and berating Garry but felt he was
justified.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the second round on, it seems as though one of two things
was happening in the ring,'' an excited Lewis explained. ``Either
he was favoring Holyfield because he was intimidated being in front
of those 40,000 people, or he was incompetent. ... I don't care
which one he chooses, but when the protest hearings happen, the
tape will not tell a lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis claims Garry did not penalize Holyfield for elbowing,
head-butting and holding throughout the fight, culminating in a
controversial 10th-round knockdown where Bean was hit near the
ropes by Holyfield. Garry said Bean was coming off the ropes and
was fair game; Lewis strenuously argued that Bean was still tied up
in the ropes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He spun and pivoted back into fair territory,'' Garry said.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield ``flung my guy into the ropes, held him with one arm
and punched him twice when he was in the ropes!'' Lewis countered.
``Then my guy got up and he gave him an eight-count! I'm like,
what?!''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Lewis stepped up his abuse of Garry, continuing
to yell obscenities at him and getting in Garry's face during an
interview after the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Bean got knocked down (in the 10th round), Lewis went
ballistic with obscenities at me,'' Garry said. ``He was pounding
on the ring and apron, I had to ask a highway patrolman to control
him. ... The (Georgia boxing) commission wanted me to take a point
from Bean to punish Lewis, but I wouldn't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm cussing, my blood pressure is going up and Garry just
says, 'I'm in charge' and walks away,'' Lewis said. ``I'm all upset
about what this Garry was not doing in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm emotional, everyone knows that. I stand up for my guy. If
you don't like it, so what. ... He said he was going to have me
removed. You're going to have me removed?! You're going to be
(expletive) removed!''

SO FAR, LOOKS LIKE JERRY'S GOT IT RIGHT

<TEXT>
<P>
   Only three games into the NFL season, the Cowboys have
experienced many adventures, including, of course, a variety of
misadventures.
</P>
<P>
   Going back to training camp in Wichita Falls, there has been the
Troy Aikman injury, the Emmitt Smith injury, the Leon Lett injury,
the defensive humiliation in Denver, the winless preseason, the
campus neck-slashing and the brief but ugly headlines concerning a
known good guy in Larry Allen.
</P>
<P>
   In some football precincts, particularly with the cave-dwellers
across the Red River, the rush to judgment has begun. ``See there,
bay-bee, Jerry changed coaches but everything remained the same.
Bad team. Bad people.''
</P>
<P>
   No. Wrong again, dust bowl breath. At Valley Ranch, where only
football is the focus these days, there is currently more progress
and more positive vibes than the previous four seasons combined.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, this can change in a hurry. Like today at Texas Stadium
with the Raiders in town. The Cowboys have holes in their lineup
the size of moon craters.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman said in Denver to give his collarbone four weeks and he'd
be back. Even if that's medically true, there are still three more
games with Jason Garrett at quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   From Jerry Jones: ``We've had some setbacks _ Troy's injury
topping the list _ but I've seen enough already to know this will
be a totally prepared and confident team no matter what the
circumstances. Like Jason being a leader for us in New York. There
is a sense of excitement and energy because of the players and the
coaching staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I was about to get around to praising Jones for taking
a lead in bringing about a transformation at Valley Ranch. That, of
course, started back in February with the surprise hiring of Chan
Gailey, who was not exactly in my top five, or even top 20, of head
coaches the Cowboys absolutely had to have.
</P>
<P>
   But last weekend in a New York newspaper, Jones was giving
credit elsewhere for the Cowboys' 180 from last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did need a change. (Bleep) convinced me of that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Huh? So it was (bleep) _ Mr. Insignificant Sideline Personnel
himself _ who forced Jerry to fire him as head coach and bring in
someone else? All praise then should go to (bleep).
</P>
<P>
   Well, not exactly, Jones explained the other day.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was bad sentence structure on my part,'' he said. ``I
shouldn't have said it that way. I was the one convinced we had to
make changes. But in discussing it with (bleep) and a lot of other
people, they did confirm that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have a problem when talking about people I've had a
close association with, in saying, `I let that guy go _ I fired
that guy.' And that includes Jimmy (Johnson), too.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an old yet still valid argument that Jones didn't make his
latest change soon enough. He didn't, period. But once Jones wiped
out the past, the important thing was he got it right with the new
hire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so early yet to predict what will happen to our team
this season,'' noted Jones. ``With injuries alone, that can bring
me or any of us back to earth in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what I'm most pleased about is with Chan in charge, no one
can now say that Jerry drove up on the freeway ramp going the wrong
way.''
</P>
<P>
   As was noted back in January and February, Jones was addicted to
``homework'' as he searched for a new coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm questioned all the time about me being the general
manager,'' he said. ``One reason I think I can be is because I'm
never afraid to ask anyone in football for an opinion. My questions
sound naive, even stupid, a lot of times, I'm sure. But I want to
know, and I'll ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those questions I asked about Chan, and the answers I got
from a Joe Gibbs, a Dan Reeves and so many others, I can see those
answers now starting to be right-on. What they said about Chan is
what shows up now with our football team.''
</P>
<P>
   None of this works, obviously, without winning. Jones, of
course, has never doubted the winning would continue this season,
provided there is any luck with health. While a preseason
prediction of 8-8 sounded reasonable to some of us, Jones talked
instead of making the playoffs and surprising people once there.
</P>
<P>
   Then the season began, and the NFC East turned up soft. Jones'
confidence of a month ago seems realistic _ at least the part about
making the playoffs. But now it's Jerry being very cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I repeat _ it's so early,'' he said. ``Oakland is going to be
a tough game. But I like the way the big picture looks, and I think
our fans are responding to what they see happening with Chan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even good came from that game in Denver, the way we came back
as a team in the second half, and that carried over to New York.
I'm excited but I also know better than to get carried away.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jones not being carried away? See there, things must have
changed.

CAVALRY ARRIVES FOR SMITH, COWBOYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Sitting and waiting always has been tough on
Cowboys running back Chris Warren.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than wait on the bench, he left the mighty University of
Virginia after two years and finished his college career at obscure
Ferrum College of Division III status.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than sit on the bench, Warren missed but five games due
to injuries and never more than two consecutively in his first
eight years with the Seattle Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps you can understand the torture he endured while
missing the first three games of the 1998 season rehabbing a
severely strained left groin. His absolute disdain for sitting and
waiting has put Warren, who was expected to miss four-to-six games,
back in uniform far sooner than the doctors anticipated when he
takes the field for today's matchup with the Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like I missed half the season,'' said Warren, who
said watching his teammates play was so tough that he tried to get
as far away from football as possible on game days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was excited about the season and the setback with the groin
injury wore on me. But it's over now. I'm pretty much ready to go
and get back on the field and be a part of what we started.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren, 30, is just happy the waiting game is over. After
attending the Cowboys season opener against the Cardinals, Warren
tried to watch the Cowboys' road games against the Broncos and
Giants.
</P>
<P>
   However, he found himself leaving and doing extra rehabilitation
to expedite his recovery, unbeknownst to the Cowboys trainers. As a
result, Warren reduced his original prognosis from four-to-six
games to three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was working out, but they didn't know it,'' he said. ``I was
just doing little stuff, extra stretching and light jogging. There
are some things you have to do on your own that trainers and
coaches don't tell you. But I was determined to get back.''
</P>
<P>
   That Warren has healed faster than expected is no surprise to
Cowboys running backs coach Clarence Shelmon, who said Warren has a
history of returning early from injuries. Shelmon said he would
have been surprised if Warren ``did miss six weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this was hard on him and he was going to work to get
back,'' said Shelmon, who coached Warren in Seattle. ``He told me
this (sitting out) was one of the hardest things he ever had to do.
And this is a guy not given to a lot statements.''
</P>
<P>
   With starter Emmitt Smith hobbled by a strained groin, Warren's
return couldn't have come at a more opportune time. Smith is slated
to start and Warren will serve as the team's third-down back in
passing situations.
</P>
<P>
   However, Emmitt hobbling and Warren waiting in the wings is
precisely why the Cowboys signed the nine-year veteran to a
free-agent contract. Cowboys coach Chan Gailey brought in Warren to
take some of the load off Smith and serve as an insurance policy.
Smith missed parts of five games last season and the final three
quarters of last Monday's victory against the Giants due to
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``You better believe I'm glad to see him back, a back of that
caliber,'' Gailey said. ``You saw him in the preseason. He is an
excellent runner, a good blocker. He can catch the ball out of the
backfield. We can split him out and use him as a receiver. He does
a lot different things. He brings a lot to the table for our
football team.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren, who has 6,076 career rushing yards and is three-time Pro
Bowl selection, also brings an understanding of his role. Warren
said the experience of sharing the backfield in Seattle last season
with Lamar Smith and Steven Broussard helped him prepare to be
Smith's backup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard at first when I was in Seattle because I didn't
see any reason for splitting time,'' Warren said. ``It's not a
problem here. Emmitt is the starter. I am the backup.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren said he came to the Cowboys partly because of Shelmon's
presence and partly because of the Cowboys' winning tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Warren, who has never played in the postseason, had discussions
with Chiefs and Patriots following his release from the Seahawks
last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``If just felt right for me to be playing here,'' said Warren,
who said he took less money to play for the Cowboys than he would
asked to go elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Warren's three-year contract, $2 million contract with the
Cowboys includes a $600,000 signing bonus. However, excluding
incentives, he stands to make only $220,000 this season in base
salary. His contract goes up to $550,000 in 1999 and tops out at
$715,000 in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Shelmon said the situation is good for Warren and the Cowboys.
He said Warren will make the Cowboys more potent because his style
is different from Smith's.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a chance to have two Pro Bowl players playing a
position, you can't get much better than that,'' Shelmon said.
``And he and Emmitt are two different types of runners. Chris is
more of a slasher and acceleration type of guy. Playing against
both of them is going to cause problems for the defense. You have
the freshness of two bonafide guys and then they hurt you in
different ways.''

REAL ESTATE: THE TREND TO INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION IS GROWING
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JOHN HOLUSHA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Sept. 15 announcement by the real estate services
company Cushman &AMP; Wakefield that it is merging with the
London-based firm of Healey &AMP; Baker will create a company that, by
real estate standards, is huge, with annual revenues of over $700
million and more than 7,700 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more important, it will largely complete the
transformation of what was once a New York-area company into a
global player, with 129 offices in 39 countries.
</P>
<P>
   The deal comes at a time when many leading commercial real
estate executives are predicting that within a short time there
will be just a handful of companies operating internationally to
provide services for multinational corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing the elimination of the midsize real estate
company in the United States,'' said William S. Rothe, a senior
executive managing director of CB Richard Ellis, which has been
active in the acquisition contest.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, CB Commercial acquired Richard Ellis
International and changed its name to CB Richard Ellis. Because of
a previous split in the Richard Ellis company, the purchase did not
include the Richard Ellis operations in Britain or the use of the
name in that country.
</P>
<P>
   To round out its operations in Europe, CB subsequently acquired
Hillier Parker, which has 500 employees and is based in London. The
company claims to be the largest commercial real estate company
operating globally, employing 9,400 people, with 215 offices in 29
countries and revenues of $848 million.
</P>
<P>
   Another company, Insignia/ESG, which is based largely on the
Edward S. Gordon company of New York, has been on an acquisition
tear as well. In the last two years, it has taken over 10 real
estate companies in this country, including operations in Chicago,
greater Philadelphia, the Washington area, Denver, Oregon,
Washington State, Orange County in California and the
Rostenberg-Doern firm of Westchester County in New York and
Fairfield County in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Expanding internationally, Insignia/ESG acquired the Richard
Ellis Group in Britain and hired two executives from the European
Richard Ellis company to open an office in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   As its focus has grown on commercial real estate, Insignia is
divesting itself of the residential ownership and management
operations on which the business was originally built. The company
said it expects to complete the divestiture to Apartment Investment
and Management Company, or AIMCO, by early next month. That will
leave it with commercial operations, a residential brokerage in
Ohio and 59,000 residential units in the New York City area, which
are managed by the Insignia Residential Group.
</P>
<P>
   Once that sale has taken place, the company will go shopping
again in this country, said Stephen B. Siegel, Insignia/ESG's
president and chief executive, looking initially at the Boston and
San Francisco Bay areas. ``We are cleaning ourselves up with the
AIMCO deal and once that is done we're back to growth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Consolidation is taking place on the residential side of the
business as well. The group that took control of Brown Harris
Stevens in 1995, which includes Kent M. Swig, William Lie
Zeckendorf, Arthur W. Zeckendorf and David A. Burris, has formed a
company called SBZZ NorthStar Holdings.
</P>
<P>
   This vehicle has acquired the Feathered Nest brokerage in
Manhattan, William Hutton Associates in Palm Beach, Fla., and the
Real Estate Center of Winter Park in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the commercial side, LaSalle Partners of Chicago, which
acquired the Galbraith Company last year, recently agreed to buy
Compass Management and Leasing from Lend Lease, making LaSalle the
largest real estate management services company in the country,
with 400 million square feet. The company has also said that it has
had discussions for some kind of combination with Jones Lang
Wootton, which has it roots in Britain. Both Compass and Jones Lang
have operations in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Although real estate has traditionally been a local business,
executives say the industry's current consolidation reflects
changes in corporate America. The trend to hire contractors to
fulfill functions deemed to be not essential to a company's basic
business and the reduction in the number of white collar employees
has made many companies unwilling to deal with separate service
providers in hundreds of local markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outsourcing, downsizing and globalization all originated in
America,'' said Arthur J. Mirante, the president and chief
executive of Cushman &AMP; Wakefield. ``Companies are finding it more
efficient to do business with one or two real estate companies than
try to deal with 50.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago this was a New York company that did not care
about Los Angeles or Miami,'' said John B. Coppedge III, Cushman &AMP;
Wakefield's executive managing director for international
operations. ``Then we started to care because our clients cared. If
a New York client wanted an office in Los Angeles we realized we
had better be able to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mirante said Cushman &AMP; Wakefield began a partnership with Healey
&AMP; Baker eight years ago and had recently been averaging 100 joint
transactions a year. He said both firms placed executives in each
other's offices so they could learn each other's culture and ways
of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   He said the merger was driven by client demands for uniformity
and technological capability that would be difficulty to achieve in
an informal alliance. ``You just can't call a partner and say you
have to have Lotus Notes in all your offices by next week, even
though it is a $10 million investment,'' Mirante said.
</P>
<P>
   Rothe of CB Richard Ellis said he agrees that a formal
relationship is preferable to even the closest alliance in
presenting a uniform face to clients. ``Suppose you have an
assignment to find four expansion sites for a client, three of
which will be profitable and one not,'' he said. ``If you ask an
affiliate to do the unprofitable work, they will start to make
excuses. And if you have to start negotiating with a partner, the
client hears about it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   So the two parties devised the transaction whereby Cushman &AMP;
Wakefield invested $112 million to buy the Healey &AMP; Baker
partnership and Healey &AMP; Baker took 35 percent of that amount, or
slightly over $39 million, to buy Cushman &AMP; Wakefield stock for
distribution to Healey &AMP; Baker partners.
</P>
<P>
   Mirante said the arrangement builds in an incentive for existing
partners to remain and work to further build the company by tying
their compensation to financial performance. He said Cushman &AMP;
Wakefield would invest in what is now its subsidiary in Europe, the
Middle East and Africa to further develop its operations.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the work of integration will have to take place at
Cushman &AMP; Wakefield's New York office and 44 other offices around
the country, because of their domestic origin. ``I doubt that 10
percent of our people know how to dial the international access
code and country and city codes,'' said Coppedge. ``We've got 1,000
brokers we have to get accustomed to doing business overseas.''
</P>
<P>
   Real estate executives acknowledge that there are risks
associated with rapid expansion. Mirante concedes that his company
went too far in its domestic development, and was forced to cut
back from a high of 60 offices to the present 45.
</P>
<P>
   Integrating diverse cultures is a major issue, said Neil Young,
the chairman of Grubb &AMP; Ellis, which expanded rapidly after
becoming a publicly traded company in 1981, and then nearly failed
when the slump at the end of the decade forced $100 million in
writeoffs and office closings.
</P>
<P>
   Young said many of the problems were associated with trying to
pull a rapid series of acquisitions into a single organization.
``I've been here for 14 years, and I've seen the problems that can
happen with integration,'' he said. Of the 23 companies that Grubb
&AMP; Ellis bought to go national, all but two turned out to be
disappointments, he has said. In many cases, the acquisitions
turned out to be exit strategies for the former owners, who did not
contribute to the business after the transaction, Young said.
</P>
<P>
   The company has had an office in London for the last year and a
half to serve clients interested in the European market. He said he
is talking to companies about possible acquisitions, but is also
considering opening his company's own offices in major foreign
markets. ``We could go de novo,'' he said. ``That way you open up
with one name and no integration problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Others think global consolidation is moving too rapidly for such
an approach. ``The clients have made it clear what they want,''
Mirante said. ``Only the companies that provide the highest quality
of services on a global basis will get the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Coppedge said that ``there will be three or four of us globally,
and if you are not global quickly you may be left out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very expensive and complicated to open offices in
different countries on your own,'' he said.

JOE MILLER, 95, INDUSTRIALIST AND GEHRIG FRIEND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (REPEATING for all to correct coding)  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Ariz.)  (mk) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joe Miller's pal was born to play soccer, and he played it with
such flair that 80 years later Miller could raise the hairs on a
listener's neck simply describing his friend's powerful kick.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Miller, a Bronx native, got to know him in history
class at the old High School of Commerce in Manhattan, his pal, a
big German guy, was well on his way to being converted to football,
proving good enough to win a scholarship to Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was a pretty fair athlete himself, but baseball was his
sport, which is why Miller, a retired industrialist who was 95 when
he died on Sept. 3 in Tucson, Ariz., was remembered less for his
brilliant business career than for a high school friendship and the
day in 1917 when he and some of his high school teammates got to
talking about Miller's pal, Lou Gehrig, and it dawned on them that
if Gehrig was that good at soccer and football, then surely they
could teach him to play baseball.
</P>
<P>
   They did, too, and with such spectacular success that after
Miller, an affable man who amassed an impressive art collection and
became a benefactor of the University of Arizona, retired to Tucson
in 1972, he talked more about baseball than about his pioneering
work as an industrial chemist.
</P>
<P>
   It was not that Miller, a Columbia graduate who earned a
master's degree in chemical engineering from Yale and worked for du
Pont before starting his own industrial paint company, Pyrolac
Corp., in Hawthorn, N.J., was ashamed that he made a fortune with a
special protective coating for bathroom fixtures. Nor was he
ashamed that he made an even larger fortune developing a metallic
paint that made it possible for cars to blossom into a rainbow of
hues other than black.
</P>
<P>
   And he was certainly proud enough that he developed the lacquer
Jackie Kennedy applied to White House antiques and that a
heat-resistant coating he developed protected the Apollo spacecraft
on trips to the Moon.
</P>
<P>
   But for all his business success, Miller never for one moment
forgot that nothing was more important than baseball.
</P>
<P>
   A pitcher, Miller played for Columbia and was so impressive in
semi-pro ball that he was offered a contract by the Yankees. He
turned it down, partly because he wanted to concentrate on his
studies and partly because by the time he left high school, he had,
by his own gleeful account later, done about as much as he could
for the national pastime.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is true that Gehrig had played stickball as a kid, but
when he reached the Commerce annex on West 46th Street, baseball
was an alien sport.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Miller put it in an interview last year: ``Lou didn't
know how to play baseball, but we thought we'd teach him. He didn't
want to play at first, but after about a year, he picked it up
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Gehrig had natural power, teaching him the game was the
easy part. The trick was to get Gehrig, who did, after all, have a
storied tendency to stick with whatever he started, to take up
baseball in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   With Gehrig under old world pressure from his mother and feeling
his own dogged sense of responsibility to shun athletics and all
other extracurricular activities in favor of his accounting
studies, it took the combined wheedling of Miller, the other
Commerce players and the coach to persuade him to take his nose out
of his books and put his eye on the ball.
</P>
<P>
   (In the end it was his bookkeeping teacher, a baseball fan, who
did the trick, threatening to flunk him if he did not go out for
the team.)
</P>
<P>
   Rocky as he was at first, Gehrig, whose fielding skills were
still notoriously deficient when he joined the Yankees organization
in 1923, proved such a quick study and had such acute eyesight that
by the time Commerce won the New York City public school
championship in 1920 he was already being called the Babe Ruth of
high school baseball in New York.
</P>
<P>
   He added a national cachet to the sobriquet on June 26, 1920,
when, in a celebrated showdown at Cubs Park between Commerce and
the Chicago city champions, Lane Tech, Gehrig iced a 12-6 Commerce
victory with a towering grand slam home run in the ninth inning,
becoming the only high school player to knock one out of what is
now known as Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   (For all that, at a time when college baseball was an
afterthought, it was Gehrig's football prowess that landed him a
scholarship to Columbia.)
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who played semi-pro ball during his student years
against several baseball greats, including Satchel Paige, may not,
as he told his wife, have once struck out Babe Ruth, but his
friendship with Gehrig was real.
</P>
<P>
   He attended Gehrig's wedding, helped him pick out his first
house, was a frequent dugout guest during Gehrig's 2,130
consecutive game streak and was at Yankee Stadium for the stricken
Gehrig's famous ``luckiest man'' farewell in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   After his role in discovering and honing Gehrig's baseball
talents, it is understandable that Miller, who clearly had an eye
for quality, would be just as particular in his taste for women.
</P>
<P>
   After a long, high-spirited and persistent pursuit, Miller
finally found one worth keeping who was willing to take him and his
baseball memories to heart: a Tucson widow named Ruth Reed. She was
70 and he was 90 when they married five years ago.

possession, the Bill Doak model baseball glove he got at Schultz
Sporting Goods when he was 14 and teaching Lou Gehrig how to play
baseball.

   MEXICO-MASSACRE _ MEXICO CITY _ At 22, she paid a high price for
joining Mexico's student movement for freedom. On Oct. 2, 1968 _ on
the eve of the Olympic Games in Mexico _ Ana Ignacia Rodriguez was
in Mexico City's Plaza of the Three Cultures for a rally. As dusk
approached, bullets suddenly began to rain on the square, an
ancient pre-Colombian site also called Tlatelolco. ``Nacha,'' as
she was nicknamed, fled for her life as dozens, hundreds or even
thousands _nobody really knows _ were cut down by military bullets.
Within a couple of months, Nacha was detained and, along with other
students, sentenced to 16 years in prison on trumped up charges of
sedition and homicide. She served two years, part of a shocking
experience that scarred a generation and tarnished Mexico's
reputation around the world. Of all the student movements of1968,
Mexico's was perhaps the most violently repressed. Thirty years
later, Mexicans are preparing to commemorate this event, which
still remains shrouded in government secrecy. (Ferriss, Cox News
Service).

   THE CLINTON CRISIS
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-AUTHORITY _ WASHINGTON _ The year was 1863, the nation
was torn by civil war and the president was struggling against
virulent forces ready to abandon the fight against a rebellion that
had split the country in two. With just 272 well-chosen words,
however, Abraham Lincoln rallied a weary people around the cause of
union and refined the purpose of their very nationhood, in what may
be the single greatest use in American history of the sheer weight
of one man's character and the authority of the office he holds. A
hundred and thirty five years after Lincoln's Gettysburg Address,
the nation is at odds once more, divided this time by the leader
himself, who's own moral authority is at the center of a battle
raging in Congress and the American public at large over whether
Bill Clinton is fit to serve. How important is moral authority to
the American presidency, where does it come from and how might
Clinton regain it if he remains in office? (Deans, Cox News Service
1500).

</P>
<P>
   GINGRICH _ President Clinton is not the only politician caught
in the impeachment cross-hairs. So is the Speaker. On one hand,
Gingrich must try to make the process appear as non-partisan as
possible if Republicans are to avoid any backlash. On the other
hand, he cannot appear too soft nor can he afford not to hold
hearings, given the unrest in the right wing of his own party and
his upcoming election for Speaker. It's a slippery path and one
that seems to lead almost inevitably to impeachment hearings.
(Sherman, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS _ The impeachment ruckus has smothered everything on
the Hill, and many members of Congress are now worried about what
has not been done, and the spotty legislative record they must take
to the campaign trail. (Foskett, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   LEGALESE _ As the intricate details of the war of words between
President Clinton and independent counsel Kenneth Starr have come
into public view, many Americans are scoffing at legal distinctions
they see as just more doublespeak from Spin City lawyers. But in
many ways, attorneys and experts say, the case reveals how lawyers,
defendants and witnesses proceed linguistically in court every day.
``When people say it's legal mumbo-jumbo, this is important legal
mumbo-jumbo,'' said Atlanta attorney Craig Gillen, who was a
prosecutor in the Iran-Contra investigation. ``Words mean
everything. Words are exceedingly important.'' (Croft, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
   TELCOM-CONGRESS _ WASHINGTON _ The scorecard is mixed when it
comes to legislative and regulator opinion on all the consolidation
in the industry. Congress isn't sure if mergers are what it had
mind when it passed the 1996 Telcom bill. FCC commisioner William
Kennard seems to think that mergers could hasten univeral access to
the Internet. Why the split? What's the likely outcome as Congress
holds hearings on this issue? (Glass, Cox News Service).

   DISEASE-RESEARCH _ WASHINGTON _ With Congress and President
Clinton set to approve substantial increases in the research budget
of the National Institutes of Health, lobbying groups that
represent particular disease communities _ the National Cancer
Society, for example _ are lining up their forces to grab as much
of the pie as they can. Cancer groups were to ``march'' together
Saturday (Sept. 26) in solidarity for cancer research. Story will
compare data on how much money goes for each of the major diseases
_ cancer, AIDS, heart disease, etc._ how many people get killed by
those diseases, how big the budgets of the various health lobbying
groups happens to be. (Nesmith, Cox News Service).

   BUILDING-WASTE _ WASHINGTON _ The project has been announced and
the cost set at a whopping $1.3 billion. Can citizen watchdog
groups now slow down the construction of an enormous new Patent and
Trademark Building that they have dubbed the ``Taj Mahal''?
Lawmakers, especially those from Northern Virginia where it would
be located, tried to quell the furor over the project last week by
allowing the critics to vent. But the project is on track anyway.
Foes say stopping it is crucial to stopping a tradition of waste
and extravagance in federal buildings, such as the recently
completed Ronald Reagan Building. (Malone, Cox News Service).

of his controversial, off-campus operation that ran lucrative drug
trials for the nation's top pharmaceutical companies. Borison was
famous in his field and became wealthy through his scheme, with a
model in his office of an immense gothic mansion he was planning to
build. Borison's partner, Dr. Bruce Diamond pleaded guilty last
year and is already serving time. Borison's defense will argue that
this case should be a civil action, not a criminal trial.

   DAYTONA _ DAYTONA BEACH, Fla._ After Labor Day and the end of
the summer high season, Laura Pittman is accustomed to business
slowing down at the gift shop where she works. But this year's
slow-down comes after a summer in which Florida's wildfire crisis
devastated the normally busy June-July period. Even after the fires
were put out, many visitors stayed away, thinking the area was in
charred ruins, business owners say. Tourism officials hope to
recoup some of the losses with several big events this fall, but
business owners fear it will be too little too late. ``October will
be better than normal, but it can't replace July,'' said Patrick
Welsh, owner of the 10-room Beach House Motel, who suffered a 50
percent loss during July. (MWilliams, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   RUDOLPH _This fall is the first time Birmingham bombing suspect
Eric Robert Rudolph has been in the Western North Carolina
mountains during hunting seasons, and federal officals hope that
fact, combined with the coming winter, will give them a better
chance to find him. Bearhunting season starts Oct. 12, but federal
officials will meet with hunters in Andrews, N.C. to ask for their
participation and remind them of safety tips because agents will
also be in the woods. Bearhunters use tracking dogs, and it's
possible one could stumble on the fugitive or unearth some
evidence. We'll also round up everybody else still in the woods:
feds are now up to 80 agents, and there are a few hangers-on and
quasi-bounty hunters around. 25 inches. (Scruggs, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)

benefits and give readers an idea what they can expect in the near
future. (Townsend, Dayton Daily News). 25-30. WITH ILLUSTRATION.

VICIOSA WINS 5TH AVE. MILE 4TH STRAIGHT TIME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (mk) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the 1970s, the Oakland A's won three straight
World Series, but not four. In the 1980s, Ivan Lendl won three
straight U.S. Open tennis titles, but not four. Early in the 1990s,
the Chicago Bulls won three straight National Basketball
Association titles, but not four.
</P>
<P>
   Isaac Viciosa, a 28-year-old, dark-haired Spaniard, has gone one
better. He won the Donald Trump Fifth Avenue Mile for men Saturday
for the fourth year in a row, a tribute to fine conditioning, a
keen sense of racing tactics and a killing sprint. Regina Jacobs of
Oakland, Calif., at 35 the oldest of the 12 in the women's race,
won that mile easily.
</P>
<P>
   The 19 races for children as young as 7 and veterans as old as
95 began at 80th Street and ended at 60th Street. In the men's
race, which had 17 starters, Viciosa felt the early pace was too
fast and backed off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to pay the consequences at the end,'' he said
through his coach and translator, Miguel Mostaza. ``But at the same
time you have to watch out for the other favorites. As the race
went on, I saw they were there. I was not really worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Halfway through the race, Viciosa was in front. He stayed there,
sprinting the last 60 meters and holding off Anthony Whiteman of
Britain by two feet. Viciosa's time of 3 minutes 55.59 seconds was
the slowest of his four victories, but because his kick is so good
he seems to run only as fast as he must.
</P>
<P>
   Whiteman, the runner-up last year, too, was surprised he did so
well this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very tired,'' he said. ``I'm on my fourth continent in
10 days. In that time, I've run in the World Cup in South Africa
and the Commonwealth Games in Malaysia, gone back to England to
pick up my girlfriend and flown here.''
</P>
<P>
   In the women's race, Jacobs took an immediate lead and ran by
herself. She beat Kelly Holmes of Britain by 13 meters in 4:20.8
and then sprinted back toward 62nd Street to thank the spectators
for cheering so loudly. She, like Viciosa, earned a winner's purse
of $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   This has been a career year for Jacobs, who ran her fastest ever
for 800 meters, the mile, 3,000 meters and 5,000 meters. Two weeks
ago, in the World Cup, she finished second at 5,000 meters and
third at 3,000. Viciosa has had a big year, too, winning the
European 5,000-meter title and setting a European record at 3,000
meters.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs said she was getting excited because she was running so
well in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I plan to run more and more in the U.S. next year,'' she said.
``Maybe I'll motivate some young kids to succeed me. If they just
read about performances and don't see them, they won't get
inspired.''
</P>
<P>
   Viciosa wants to run here, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``This race is mucho prestigio,'' he said. ``I'm very happy to
run in New York every year and make history. Winning four years in
a row is very hard. I hope next year I can come back and win a
fifth time.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump, who puts up the prize and appearance money, had a quick
response to that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be back,'' Trump said.

<P>
   In some wealthy New York suburbs, the tearing down of older
homes to make way for massive new luxury houses has moved beyond
the curiosity phase. As the pattern has picked up speed, several
towns have begun to look at ways of scaling back the size of what
some irritated neighbors call ``McMansions.'' And many longtime
residents who associate the older, smaller homes that are being
knocked down with their towns' very character are speaking out
against houses they say are out of sync with their communities.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury home builders such as Richard R. Girouard, owner of
Girouard Associates in New Canaan, Conn., however, consider the
selective razing of houses from generations gone by a suburban
upgrade. ``Esthetically, I believe, I'm improving the town,'' said
Girouard, who specializes in building $1.8-million-to-$4-million
mansions.
</P>
<P>
   But others view the towering displays of wealth encroaching on
their neighborhoods with little short of horror. In response, a
number of communities, including New Canaan, Greenwich and
Westport, Conn., and Ridgewood, N.J., as well as Hamptons
communities on Long Island, N.Y., are weighing proposals that would
extend restrictions on the size of houses or slow the demolition
process.
</P>
<P>
   Planners say the teardown trend can detract from a well-planned
community in a variety of ways. If the new houses are out of scale
with the rest of the neighborhood, they can upset the streetscape
by eating up lawn space and shade trees. And, they add, the
architecture of some of these trophy houses is of questionable
quality _ too much emphasis on ``big,'' and not enough attention to
design. Moreover, they say, the stock of lower-priced housing
declines as luxury homes replace smaller dwellings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of incremental redevelopment of a neighborhood could
have a social impact,'' said Jeffrey Soule, policy director for the
American Planning Association, based in Washington. ``People with
different goals and values moving into the same neighborhood can
create conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   New Canaan is a case in point. A history-minded community with a
well-preserved architectural and natural beauty, New Canaan has
attracted moneyed professionals ever since the arrival of rail
travel in the late 19th century. Recent cases in which smaller
homes have been knocked aside to make way for what some call
``starter castles'' have provoked a debate that, at its ugliest,
has come down to questions of class and taste.
</P>
<P>
   Residents have taken to insulting each other anonymously through
The New Canaan Advertiser's reader opinion line. In August the
column printed the opinion of one defender of the sizable new
houses who accused critics of being ``jealous'' because they live
in ``tacky ranches and crummy houses that need work.'' Other
callers responded with equal intensity. One man said the statement
showed an ``obvious and total lack of breeding.'' Another caller
said the people who live in the enormous new houses were ``more
into showing how much money they have'' than in housing quality.
</P>
<P>
   The divide has echoes of an earlier era in New Canaan's history.
As recalled by Richard R. Bergmann, chairman of New Canaan's
Historic District Commission, in the 1940s and '50s a handful of
pioneering architects ran up against considerable criticism when
they began building what were considered odd-shaped houses in the
modern style throughout the town.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn together through various ties to Harvard, Philip Johnson,
Marcel Breuer, Eliot Noyes, John M. Johansen and Landis Gores
followed one another to New Canaan to practice the flat-roofed,
boxy, minimalist style of architecture inspired by the Bauhaus. The
most famous example of this style, Johnson's Glass House on Ponus
Ridge Road, was considered particularly scandalous at the time,
Bergmann said.
</P>
<P>
   Now the houses are considered works of art by like-minded
architects such as Bergmann, who once worked for Noyes. But at
least three of the 30 or so houses built during this period have
since been razed, he said, lost to the more contemporary preference
for soaring ceilings, Palladian windows, multicar garages and even
a turret or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that the rooms are too small by today's
standards,'' Bergmann said. ``But it's too bad they couldn't keep
the house as a guest house and build a mansion beside it.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Homebuilders, based in Washington,
estimates that 100,000 to 200,000 houses a year are now either
completely gutted and rehabilitated or razed, primarily to make
room for high-end housing, said Gopal Ahluwalia, the organization's
director of research. Parts of the New York area where teardowns
are common have seen a gradual increase in the trend since the
early '90s, but the pace has accelerated during the latter half of
the decade.
</P>
<P>
   In Greenwich, for example, demolition of single-family homes has
nearly tripled since the 1996 fiscal year, from 16 in that year to
45 in the 1998 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 1, according to the
town Building Department. Westport counted 29 residential
demolitions in the 1998 fiscal year, which ended July 1, up sharply
from the 16 demolitions in the 1996 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Land is so scarce and demand so high for new luxury homes that
among builders ``sometimes there are feeding frenzies when a house
comes on the market,'' said Robert M. Haroun, co-owner of SIR
Development in Westport. Both Greenwich and Westport are seeking to
more tightly control the scale of the houses going up by adopting
new lot-coverage ratios.
</P>
<P>
   In New Canaan, 16 houses were demolished in 1997, twice as many
as in 1996, according to Gordon M. Donley, the town tax assessor.
He estimated that this year's total has already surpassed last
year's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The typical complaint is that these houses loom very large
over older homes,'' said Jon McEwan, New Canaan's assistant town
planner. ``They cast at least a psychological shadow. I think what
people are really opposed to is something that looks very different
from their home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These houses are often built big and wide to the street,'' he
continued, ``and so consequently, most of the trees in the front
yard are cut down. People remember the old town, so they get upset
by the new.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Richard Bond, New Canaan's First Selectman, is not convinced
that the town needs to take any action to rein in the scale of
these houses, especially, he noted, when bigger houses mean more
tax dollars for the town. Of approximately 6,000 homes in New
Canaan, he said, only about 100 would fall into the ``starter
castle'' category.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them are very attractive, some of them I don't care
for, but you come back to personal taste,'' said Bond. ``I think it
would be very difficult to legislate what size house you can
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, a subcommittee of the Planning and Zoning
Commission is considering whether to lower the maximum building
height allowance, currently 40 feet in the town's one-, two- and
four-acre zones, according to McEwan. Another possible change, he
said, would be the exclusion of overhangs (eaves and other
horizontal projections) from the lot coverage measurement to
encourage better architectural details.
</P>
<P>
   New Canaan already has what McEwan says are among the most
stringent building coverage regulations in Fairfield County. In the
two-acre zone, buildings may cover up to 5 percent, or 4,356 square
feet, of the lot; in the four-acre zone, the footprint must not
spread beyond 4 percent of the lot, or 6,969 square feet, he said.
Add in a second floor plus an attic in which 60 percent of the
space may be converted to living area, and ``you're talking a big
house,'' he said. ``But,'' he noted, ``everybody wants more.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Canaan Historical Society is lobbying for a 90-day
demolition delay on houses that are more than 50 years old. The
neighboring towns of Greenwich and Darien require such a delay.
This is intended to give adjoining property owners and historic
preservation officials time to object or discuss possible
alternatives when a particular building is set to be demolished.
</P>
<P>
   A demolition delay is already in place in New Canaan's Church
Hill historic district, a small area of 18th- and 19th-century
houses and churches adjacent to the village center. Though Bergmann
said he believes a town-wide ordinance would help ``discourage the
get-rich-quick people,'' he has only to look out the window of his
160-year-old home in the district to be reminded that a demolition
delay does not actually halt teardowns.
</P>
<P>
   The 18th-century farmhouse that once stood next door was razed
about 10 years ago, he said, after the owner ``managed to get the
Building Department to condemn the house as being unsafe.'' The
empty lot was only recently sold, and construction has since begun
on what Bergmann described as a federal-style house in keeping with
the district.
</P>
<P>
   Demolition delays and other proposed regulatory measures may, of
course, be beside the point in many cases. The oft-overlooked
truth, said James A. Fieber, a partner in the Fieber Group, which
builds luxury homes throughout Fairfield County, is that not all
houses are worth saving, particularly in areas with such high land
values. While the Fieber Group generally buys existing properties
solely for the building lot, the company will save a house with
high architectural value, such as the 1920s farmhouse sitting on
what is now a seven-lot subdivision on Pastures Lane in New Canaan.
</P>
<P>
   The six new $2.8-million-to-$3.2 million homes in the 22-acre
subdivision will have stone elements, window styles and other
details that mimic those of the original farmhouse, which is being
painstakingly renovated _ at a cost of close to $3 million _ for a
buyer who was uninterested in new construction, Fieber said. But
for that kind of property, he added, ``you have to have the right
buyer.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the new caveat might be ``seller beware'' _ fine
architectural details do not necessarily guarantee a house's
permanence. Hilary Nocka Jones. a resident of Ridgewood, N.J.,
learned that lesson the hard way this year when she sold her
deceased parents' house in the historic Heights Road area. Situated
just south of Saddle River in Bergen County, the village of
Ridgewood is known for its bounty of large stately homes, many of
them grand Victorians. The Heights Road area is particularly
desirable because of its proximity to the train station.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jones' parents' house, which she described as a 1901
Colonial Revival with a gambrel roof, was their ``absolute pride
and joy,'' she said. With five bedrooms, the house was sizable, she
said, and was loaded with such period details as 18-inch-high
moldings and an oak stairway with a mahogany railing.
</P>
<P>
   She agreed to sell the house for $650,000 to Mark and Wendy
Epstein of New York City in April, but only found out an hour
before the closing that the Epsteins intended to tear it down.
Because the buyers had met all the terms of the contract, Mrs.
Jones was unable to stop the sale. The house was torn down in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been awful. I can't even drive up the street to look,''
said Mrs. Jones, who grew up in the house. ``I happen to believe
houses have souls at this point _ I never thought about it before
this crisis. I just wanted someone to buy it who would love the
house the way my parents did.''
</P>
<P>
   Epstein declined to comment on the matter other than to
acknowledge that he was surprised by the reaction to his plans.
Mrs. Jones circulated a petition protesting the teardown and
obtained signatures from 60 residents.
</P>
<P>
   And a neighbor, Martha Steinbach, began soliciting support for a
demolition delay and reduced floor-area ratios in Ridgewood. After
she distributed flyers on the subject, about 30 residents showed up
at a Planning Board meeting last July to voice their support, Mrs.
Steinbach said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ridgewood has one of the largest concentrations of Victorian
homes in Bergen County. And we're very proud of it,'' said Mrs.
Steinbach, who, with her husband, Robert, owns a 100-year-old
Victorian surrounded by perennial gardens on Heights Road.
``Homeowners spend thousands and thousands of dollars to maintain
these homes. So when people come in and start tearing them down,
those of us who live in these homes get a little concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you start tearing down the old homes,'' she added, ``we're
going to be like anybody else. How much of the town are we willing
to let go?''

scores for college football players confirms what we may have

than those with higher scores. Coach Gerry Dirnardo, who has been
on both sides of the fence at Vandy and now at LSU, says classroom
intelligence does not always transfer to football smarts, while
other coaches say that because of the culturally biased tests,
bright kids don't always do well. Then there is Stanford, which has
excelled in both areas. (Fish, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) 55.

 UNDATED: let go?''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Epsteins were the second buyers in two years to demolish a
house on Heights Road. Across the street from their lot, all but a
small portion of another house was taken down to make way for a
sprawling contemporary.
</P>
<P>
   But Ridgewood is by no means under siege by bulldozers. The
Epsteins' teardown represented the first complete residential
demolition since 1995, when there were four, according to the
village's Building and Inspections Department. But Mrs. Steinbach
argues that the village should act now before more houses are lost.
Under the village's existing floor-to-area ratio, or FAR, a house's
gross floor area may cover up to 30 percent of lot size, according
to Arthur Wrubel, chairman of the village's Historic Preservation
Commission and a former member of the Planning Board.
</P>
<P>
   The village's mayor, Patrick Mancuso, said the Planning Board
was reviewing the matter and would eventually present its findings
to the Village Council. But he said he was leery of acting too
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people feel unquestionably that people have a right
to do whatever they want with their property,'' the mayor said.
``Some feel it's up to the seller to prevent (demolition), possibly
through a deed restriction. Others feel any restrictions should be
done on a neighborhood by neighborhood basis. We have to listen to
a lot of different people.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Greenwich and Westport are poised to adopt zoning
regulations that set new limitations on house sizes. In Greenwich,
residents of the more rural parts of town are upset with both the
size of the houses going up in their neighborhoods and the
increasing density, according to Peter K. Joyce, chairman of the
Planning and Zoning Commission, who is a real estate agent for
Coldwell Banker.
</P>
<P>
   In those two- and four-acre zones, the town has no limits on the
size of houses as long as they meet the setback requirements, Joyce
said. So the commission is currently drafting floor-area ratios for
those districts. The town's other residential zones already have
either floor-area ratios or building coverage limits.
</P>
<P>
   Westport residents will have an opportunity to review proposed
changes in that town's building coverage regulations at a public
hearing on Oct. 29. According to Katherine G. Barnard, the planning
and zoning director, current regulations allow total lot coverage
of up to 25 percent in the one- and two-acre zones. That allowance
includes such things as driveways, tennis courts, outbuildings, and
swimming pools. The Planning and Zoning Commission wants to specify
a separate building coverage allowance similar to New Canaan's so
that the ground-floor footprint could not exceed 7 percent in the
one-acre zone and 5 percent in the two-acre zone, Ms. Barnard said.
The total coverage allowance would not change.
</P>
<P>
   The draft regulations also call for a decreased building height
allowance of 30 feet instead of the 40 feet currently allowed in
both zones, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Hamptons communities on Long Island, some towns and
villages are considering or putting into place historic-district or
landmarks measures to save older houses from demolition.
</P>
<P>
   In the village of East Hampton, administrator Larry Cantwell
said the village recently created a historic district, the third in
10 years, to protect older houses. ``Homeowners support these
districts because they see what's going on, and they want to
protect the character of their neighborhoods,'' Cantwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinances for creating historic districts are on the books in
the village of Sag Harbor and under discussion in the town of East
Hampton. In the town of Southampton, officials are debating
amendments to a historic landmarks law to protect historically
significant houses.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 8, the Southampton Town Board voted to limit new houses
to 20,000 square feet of floor space to counter what the town said
were ``recent housing market and construction trends in which new
residential construction in Southampton can occur in a scale
disproportionate to existing residential construction.''
</P>
<P>
   The law was proposed after residents in Sagaponack questioned
whether a 29-bedroom, 39-bath oceanfront mansion on which work is
now under way could be considered a single-family home. The five
building estate complex planned by Ira Rennert, an industrialist
and investor, would occupy 110,000 square feet on 63 acres of
former farmland. It would include a 77,000 square-foot house that
would be the largest home in America.
</P>
<P>
   While no houses or other structures were demolished to make way
for Rennert's complex, the pace of demolitions of older homes is
trending upward throughout the Hamptons. George Mathys, owner of
George's Roll Off and Demolition Service in Quogue, said he had
demolished 16 large homes so far this year and 18 last year.
``Probably 50 percent of them were totally livable,'' Mathys said.
``It makes me sad because I would love to live in a lot of them
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwin M. Schwenk, a founder of a preservation group, East End
Forever, said the knocking down of old houses was changing the
town's character. ``They are tearing down some of the old,
substantial structures that we knew Southampton by and coming up
with all this new-type architecture,'' said Schwenk, a Southampton
native. ``I think we are losing something.''
</P>
<P>
   Haroun, the Connecticut builder, commutes to New York City
during the week where he works full-time as a patent attorney. He
and his wife, Julie, got into the luxury home-building market as a
sideline about five years ago, he said, and since that time have
built about 15 speculative houses in Westport.
</P>
<P>
   He described the houses they have torn down as primarily 1960s
raised ranches and split levels that were never improved.
Sometimes, he said, neighbors are grateful for the changes. For
example, his company recently tore down a 600-square-foot ``shack''
that was located adjacent to a three-lot subdivision they were
developing. The shack had no running water and had been occupied by
a recluse, Haroun said. ``Three or four neighbors came to me, and
it was like I was now their godson,'' he said. ``It was an
eyesore.''
</P>
<P>
   Haroun acknowledges a backlash in Westport against the latest
round of development, adding that the financial burden placed on
the town because of school overcrowding makes it understandable.
``But at the same time,'' he noted, ``you don't want to end up a
dead community where nothing happens.''
</P>

CONE NOTCHES NO. 20 AS YANKS DOWN DEVIL RAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was supposed to be a tuneup for the post-season
for David Cone. Five innings, maybe fewer, and gone. Even Cone
conceded that the chances were slim that he would hang around long
enough Saturday to win his 20th game, and climax an amazing regular
season in stylish fashion.
</P>
<P>
   But, as has often been the case with the Yankees, the game
proved unpredictable and unbelievable. Trash the script again
because Cone wound up tossing seven sharp innings to power the
Yankees to a 3-0 victory over the Devil Rays on a festive day at
Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   When Mike Stanton bagged the 27th out, the Yanks had extended
their American League record for victories to 113 in the
penultimate contest of the regular season while Cone notched his
20th after faltering in two previous attempts. It was the first
time Cone had reached that magical plateau since going 20-3 with
the Mets in 1988 and his 10-year stretch between 20-victory seasons
set a major league record for the longest gap ever.
</P>
<P>
   Cone (20-7), who will start Game 3 of the division series on
Friday, looked sharp as he unleashed a nasty slider, a tricky
curveball and a sneaky fastball in limiting the Devil Rays to four
hits while whiffing eight and walking one. If Joe Torre had any
doubts about whether Cone is prepared for October, they were erased
Saturday because he let the 35-year-old right-hander work
economically and effortlessly for 101 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   But Torre might have another problem, although it is a pleasant
one. Shane Spencer blasted a titanic 420-foot homer off Terrell
Wade into the Devil Ray bullpen in the third, his ninth of the
season, his seventh of the month of September, setting a Yankee
rookie record, and his sixth over his last 20 at bats. With Spencer
sizzling, with Tim Raines and Darryl Strawberry hobbling and with
Chad Curtis fizzling, Torre may have to consider starting Spencer
in left field. The Texas Rangers, who could be New York's opponent
in the division series, are scheduled to start four right-handers,
which would obviously hurt Spencer's chances of starting.
</P>
<P>
   While Cone and Spencer reveled in a splendid day in the Bronx,
Bernie Williams went 1 for 4 and maintained his thin lead over
Boston's Mo Vaughn in the batting race. Williams, who singled in
his last at bat, is now batting .33601 while Vaughn, who went 1 for
3 Saturday, is at .33553, meaning they are separated by less than
half a point entering the final day of play.
</P>
<P>
   The toughest moment for Cone actually came on an out. Rich
Butler smacked a one-hopper to the mound to open the third, which
Cone did not have an opportunity to react to. He caught the ball in
his stomach, mostly out of self-defense, cradled it close to him
and then skipped on one foot and flipped side-armed to first.
</P>
<P>
   After collecting the out, Cone immediately put his hands on his
knees and exhaled. His face turned red and he looked like a
quarterback who had just been sacked by Reggie White. Trainer Gene
Monahan raced to Cone's side and the pitcher told Torre that he
felt as if he had the wind knocked out of him. Torre looked
concerned and might have thought about removing Cone right there.
But Cone threw some warmups, stayed in the game and was virtually
unhittable.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Cairo blooped a double to right after Cone was jolted in
the stomach, but he never budged. The Devil Rays also placed
runners on first and third with out one in the fifth, but John
Flaherty bounced into a fielder's choice in which Butler was nailed
at home and Quinton McCracken punched a grounder to second. After
the out, the normally stoic Cone pumped his fist. He realized that
he was on the verge of an important milestone and Torre let Cone
stay in two more innings to protect the potential victory.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Torre lounged in the dugout and spoke about the
Yankees for close to an hour. On and on, the manager chatted about
this remarkable team. Torre was thoroughly enjoying the banter and
even balked when a club official tried to terminate the lengthy
interview session.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you doing?,'' asked Torre. ``I'm comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre stayed in the dugout a little longer and stayed
comfortable all afternoon as the Yankees won again. Cone was
tremendous, Spencer was terrific, Tino Martinez also homered and
Williams is still leading the batting race.
</P>
<P>
   Trash the script. The Yankees keep writing better stories.

 &HT;    RELIEF SLOW IN COMING, AS BATTERED DOMINICAN REPUBLIC STRUGGLES
TO RECOVER
 &HT;    ATTN EDs: Optional add begins at 600 words.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   POLO, Dominican Republic _ On a fresh stream bed of rocks --
many the size of basketballs -- the friends and neighbors of Julio
Feliz sifted through the soaking documents of a family lost to
Hurricane Georges.
</P>
<P>
   Four members of the family were killed during the night last
Tuesday when the hurricane swept through this town of 14,000
people, spawning massive rock slides and slashing deep ravines that
damaged roughly 80 percent of the ramshackle tin-roofed wooden
houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have much pain in my heart because what passed through here
was so immense,'' said Lydia Maria Jimenez Reyes, 51, a neighbor
who helped delicately peel the Feliz family's documents apart and
put them on rocks to dry. ``We were fabulous friends and all of a
sudden they are gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Near the smashed wooden house -- partially swallowed by the
torrent of rocks that swept down from the mountains, its roof
tilting at a precarious angle, one edge touching the ground --
Carlo Feliz poked through the remains of his brother's house. Feliz
held a photograph of a nephew, one of two members of the family
still missing. He cried as he told reporters of his fruitless
four-day search for anyone still alive from his brother's family.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of the number dead in this town varied from to 23 to 30
-- an enormous blow to a community used to burying one or two
people a month.
</P>
<P>
   The death toll in the Dominican Republic -- one of the hardest
hit countries on Georges' path -- was put at more than 200 late
Saturday with hundreds more reported missing.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said damages to farms, roads and buildings
from Hurricane Georges will surpass $1.2 billion. The hurricane hit
several large islands in its march across the Caribbean, but damage
and death were especially heavy in the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The Americas International Airport outside Santo Domingo was
reopened Saturday morning, and water service was restored to much
of the capital, said Temistocles Montas, aide to President Leonel
Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Still, exact numbers and conditions were still uncertain
Saturday as government officials continued trying to reach
widespread rural communities.
</P>
<P>
   The first rescue teams reached Polo, about 120 miles southwest
of the capital of
</P>
<P>
   Santo Domingo, about 1 a.m. EDT Saturday and the first relief
efforts did not arrive until mid-morning.
</P>
<P>
   What they found was a poor but thriving town devastated by
Georges, with many people looking to the government and
international relief as their only salvation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to live with it,'' said Mayor Ana Cuevas Pena. ``Of
course they feel destroyed in their hearts, but they have to live
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of one of the dirt roads that sprawl across this
mountainous town, Clavin(CQ) Feliz Cuevas, 48, sat in a house
stripped bare by the hurricane. Her sister and brother-in-law,
their son and his wife, and one grandchild were killed by the
storm. Another grandchild, a 4-year-old girl, was missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not eaten,'' Cuevas said. ``We have no water, no food
... no beds, no clothes. We have nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   In a week, Cuevas predicted, things would be even worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nowhere to buy food. Nowhere to buy anything. In a
week we will run out of strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Teh Associated Press reported that U.S. relief officials said
aid was arriving in Santo Domingo but could not be distributed to
many parts of the country by land. Relief flights would begin
within 48 hours, they said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to personnel and supplies from the United States,
aid began arriving from France, Spain, Italy, Canada, Chile and
other nations. The government also sought help from the World Bank
and other international agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Only 5 percent of the country's tourism centers were damaged by
the storm, Montas said. But some of the natural beauty that draws
tourists will need time to recover.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add begins.)
</P>
<P>
   Ernestina Ferreras, 48, one of about a dozen people who crowded
into Cuevas' house to talk to reporters, summed up the attitude of
many whose livelihoods were uprooted with the local coffee crop:
``There is no future in this place.''
</P>
<P>
   The burials here have been hasty. Because of the rain that
continued for days after the storm, the bodies were interred
without the usual funeral processions. Most, but not all of the
dead, were buried in quickly constructed caskets. Some were just
wrapped in sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Anibal Espinal, a thin wiry man with grizzled stubble is a
carpenter. He made three of the caskets used to bury the dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very tragic situation for us, and it is very
important to bury our people, the poor people of this country, with
dignity,'' he said. ``We cannot allow a monster to take this away
from us.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Georges, Polo was a marketplace for fresh fruits and
vegetables. Klaus Leiders, the German manager of a nearby salt
mine, said Polo was his favorite spot in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was paradise,'' he said. ``Now the feeling is desperate.
A lot of people would like to leave this place, but they have
nowhere to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of the disaster that hit Polo were everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   A road was cut by a deep ravine whose gravelled bottom lay some
40 feet below. Part of a house perched over the ravine, its
splintered side hanging in the air.
</P>
<P>
   A stream ran through an area where once there were a half-dozen
houses. The owner of one of the houses appeared in shock. Asked
what the future holds for him, he could not understand the
question.
</P>
<P>
   A church on top of a hill was crowded with people waiting to
speak to a military officer. Pews were pushed together to form
beds. On one pew were children's' shoes and toys. A chicken
scurried noisily beneath the pews.
</P>
<P>
   Men, women and children clutching jugs and buckets -- some
lashed to horses -- stood patiently in line next to a hillside
where water spouted from a narrow pipe.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the devastation there were signs of life. A group
of men hammered at a tin roof covering a demolished house. They
planned to use the metal to cover another house.
</P>
<P>
   In the street outside the town's tiny hospital, young boys
played stickball using a lively rubber ball.
</P>
<P>
   Freddy Alba, the hospital director, noted that many people are
waiting for help from the government, relief agencies and the
world. Many don't want to remain in Polo, but he said the town will
survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a town of workers,'' he said.

 NAIROBI, Kenya: United States.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mrs. el Hage often gave clothes to Nairobi's street children,
Mrs. Abdul-Aziz said, even though the el Hage family was not _
ostensibly, anyway _ well-off.
</P>
<P>
   The two families met through their children, who were attending
the Nairobi Muslim Academy and were excited about the fact that
they had American fathers, Franklin said. Franklin, who was born in
Beasley, Ark., and graduated from UCLA with a degree in
bacteriology, immigrated to Kenya in 1979, and converted to Islam a
year later.
</P>
<P>
   According to papers he filed with the Kenyan government, el Hage
was born in Sidon, Lebanon, on July 25, 1960. When he came to the
United States is unknown. He attended the University of
Southwestern Louisiana from 1978 to 1986, receiving a bachelor's
degree in urban planning, the university said by telephone on
Friday. From 1987 to 1990, he worked as an urban planner for the
city of Tucson, and from 1990 to 1992 for the Dallas Planning
Committee, el Hage said in papers he filed with the Kenyan
government. On Friday, a spokesman for the Dallas planning office
said there was no record of el Hage having worked there. Officials
in Tucson said they could not immediately confirm el Hage's story.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, a federal prosecutor suggested that the government
had evidence that indirectly tied el Hage to a mysterious 1991
killing in Brooklyn _ and thus, potentially, to the blind Egyptian
cleric Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman and the circle of Islamic militants
convicted in connection with the 1993 bombing of the World Trade
Center.
</P>
<P>
   The victim, Mustapha Shalabi, had been Abdel-Rahman's sponsor
when he entered the United States and had also run an organization
that raised money and recruited volunteers for the rebels fighting
the Soviets in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   But the two split in 1991, when the Sheik demanded that half the
money be diverted from the now-victorious Afghans to be used
instead to overthrow President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. In March of
that year, Shalabi's body was discovered in his home in Seagate,
Brooklyn, beaten, shot and repeatedly stabbed.
</P>
<P>
   The assistant U.S. attorney, Patrick Fitzgerald, said at a
hearing at which el Hage was denied bail that el Hage had arrived
in New York about a week before Shalabi's body was found in order
to take over direction of the Alkifah refugee organization.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, el Hage was in Sudan, where he met bin Laden and became
his personal secretary, according to the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, el Hage and his family moved to Kenya. He signed
a one-year lease on house No. 1523 in Fedha Estates, an
``upper-working-class development,'' as a Fedha officer described
it, on drab, flat land east of downtown Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   The rent for the first year was 20,000 Kenyan shillings, payable
in quarterly installments, increased to 25,000 shillings the next
year, the equivalent of about $500 a month at today's exchange
rate.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the house, Abdi Ali Dere, recalled in an interview
that sometimes el Hage would be a month or two late with his rent.
Otherwise there was nothing about el Hage that made him stand out
from other tenants, Dere said.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin also thought his friend seemed to be struggling
financially, and he and his wife, in the Muslim tradition of
helping the less well-off, would often take the large el Hage
family chicken and other food. ``I kind of wondered how he was
managing financially,'' Franklin said.
</P>
<P>
   El Hage's business card said that he was the director of Africa
Help, a nongovernmental organization that was said to be engaged in
health and education projects in several Kenyan towns.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and Kenyan officials have said that some Muslim relief
agencies are fronts for terrorist operations, and after the bomb
blasts here, the Kenyan government ordered six nongovernmental
organizations to cease activities and expelled some of the leaders.
The organizations have challenged the order in court, except for
Africa Help, which also went by the name Help Africa People.
</P>
<P>
   In the registration papers el Hage filed with the Kenyan
government, el Hage said the organization's main office was in
Heidelberg, Germany. The German Embassy here said it had no
information about the organization. The Kenyan government had no
contacts for the organization other than el Hage.
</P>
<P>
   El Hage listed Aadil Habib as one of the organization's local
officers. During questioning by a grand jury looking into bin
Laden's activities, el Hage denied ever knowing Habib, according to
the indictment. The indictment says Habib, who was also known as
Abu Ubaidah al-Banshiri, was a military commander in the Al Qaeda
organization, and that he died in a ferry boat accident on Lake
Victoria in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   El Hage's friend in Nairobi, Franklin, did not know any of that,
nor have any reason to suspect el Hage.
</P>
<P>
   Until August a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   That was when the FBI came to el Hage's house here and
questioned him about his relationship to bin Laden. The agents took
his laptop computer, el Hage told Franklin.
</P>
<P>
   After the questioning, el Hage gave the landlord the required
month's notice, sold off some appliances, and left Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   ``He left in a hurry,'' said Franklin.

ITALY EMBARRASSES U.S. IN DAVIS CUP PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Strange things have been happening in Davis Cup ever
since this international competition began in 1900. Patriotic
pipsqueaks have scrambled past powerhouse shoe-ins, insurmountable
deficits have inspired miraculous comebacks, and nationalistic fans
have thrown everything but kitchen sinks at players they viewed as
visiting villains.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's why this weekend's semifinal between a virtual
tag team assembled by the United States, whose big stars boycotted
the round, and a revenge-minded group of overachievers from Italy,
which hasn't won a Cup since 1976 and was routed, 5-0, by the U.S.
in Palermo five years ago, veered toward the bizarre.
</P>
<P>
   No projectiles were thrown, but logic was continually defied.
Whenever Andrea Gaudenzi, Italy's chatty top gun, spoke to the
ball, he did so in English, and it obeyed him. Could Italy be so
brazen as to throttle the United States right here in the
heartland? Yes, it could. Three strikes and the United States was
out.
</P>
<P>
   Pulling off an upset that humiliated the host nation, which owns
31 Davis Cups and had designs on securing a 32nd at Sweden's
expense in the December finale, Italy completed a giddy 3-0 sweep
of the U.S. in this best-three-of-five-match semifinal. That they
didn't face an American dream team didn't bother the Italians at
all. Taking full advantage of the absence of Pete Sampras and Andre
Agassi, and also reaping benefits from captain Tom Gullikson's
decision to confine Jim Courier to bench duty, Gaudenzi and Diego
Nargiso blithely finished off the United States with a 6-4, 7-5,
5-7, 2-6, 6-3 defeat of Todd Martin and Justin Gimelstob.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know that without Sampras and Agassi, it's another
team, but it's still the U.S. team,'' said Italy's captain, Paolo
Bertolucci, whose country was 2-7 against the U.S. prior to its
defiant performance in this round. By humbling the Americans,
Italy, which had never before hosted a final in seven previous
appearances but will now entertain Sweden on red clay, reached its
first final since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday at the Milwaukee Arena, where a not-so-coincidental
Italian street festival with a Nashville beat pulsated just outside
the painfully sluggish hardcourt, the atmosphere inside had wavered
between pep rally and seance. With the United States pushed to the
brink of elimination once Friday's singles losses by the veteran
Martin and the rookie Jan Michael Gambill put the hosts in a 2-0
hole, it was left to Martin and another 21-year-old rookie,
Gimelstob, to stave off Italy's attempt to bury them with a 3-0
sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Desperation didn't pay off, and the U.S. Davis Cup team's record
of recovery from 2-0 deficits dropped to one for 29. (Their only
comeback occurred in 1934 against Australia.)
</P>
<P>
   Saturday the Americans were forced to save two match points
against Gimelstob's serve in the 10th game of the third set, and
buoyed by their success there, they broke for 6-5 and captured the
set with an ace from Martin. The Italians backed off in the fourth
set, but in the fifth, anxious to snuff their host's comeback
hopes, they picked up their pace again.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of responding in kind, the U.S. duo ultimately buckled.
Hamstrung by Martin's slow start in the first two sets and by
Gimelstob's catastrophic service games in the fourth and eighth
games of the final set, they were upstaged by Gaudenzi's array of
heroics, including a diving backhand volley that upheld a 4-3 edge
in the fifth set, and Nargiso's calm passes down the sidelines. The
match took three hours 29 minutes to resolve, and when Martin's
final return had caromed harmlessly out of bounds on the third
match point, Nargiso, who hadn't played in a month due to
hypoglycemia-induced fatigue, fell smack on his back and was
immediately joined by his partner, who belly-flopped on top of him.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I served a really poor fifth set; you can't play two egregious
service games in a row like that,'' said Gimelstob, whose Grand
Slam poise _ he captured two mixed-doubles titles with Venus
Williams this year _ deserted him in his Davis Cup debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I panicked a little bit,'' said Gimelstob, who doublefaulted
twice in succession to put his team down 3-1 in the final set, a
lapse they only temporarily repaired by breaking back in the fifth
game for 3-2. When Gimelstob failed again in the eighth game, the
Italians went up 5-3 and got their first chance to serve for the
match and seal their spot in the final.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the 1973 final, when Australia's Rod Laver and John
Newcombe made themselves overly at home in Cleveland, had the U.S.
been swept on its own turf. Not since 1987, when Boris Becker led a
West German team to victory in Hartford, had the U.S. surrendered a
home stand. Italy's coup ended an 18-match home winning streak for
the U.S. and was, said Gaudenzi, possibly the start of something
big at home for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tennis is not the main sport, but when it gets to Davis Cup,
when there is a flag involved, Italy is very emotional, so I hope
this can help the tennis movement in Italy,'' said Gaudenzi. ``Even
if we didn't beat the best U.S. team, this is a big result for
us.''

 &HT;    Employee benefits to undergo major change
 &HT;    By Angela Townsend
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Employee benefits, which many working Americans
consider only slightly less important than wages or salary, are
undergoing unprecedented change.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, companies nationwide are offering benefits once
unheard of. These perks include elder care, adoption assistance,
government-mandated family leave and continuing health care
coverage even after you become unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   But the big news is what traditional benefits workers are losing
these days.
</P>
<P>
   In June the U.S. Supreme Court refused to consider an appeal of
a January ruling by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Cincinnati that said General Motors Corp. had the right to change
or end the free lifetime health care benefits to retirees. The
court said GM's plan plainly stated the company could amend or
terminate it. In 1989, 84,000 salaried employees who retired from
GM between 1974 and 1988 filed suit, saying GM had reneged on a
promise.
</P>
<P>
   Sears Roebuck &AMP; Co. retirees are still fighting the company's
decision last year to reduce all retiree life insurance policies to
$5,000 over 10 years, while entirely cutting benefits for current
employees. The average retiree had a $17,000 whole life policy
through the company, although some policies were for as much as
$100,000. About 84,000 retirees were affected by the change. The
retirees, who have formed a national association, say Sears used
the life insurance ''lifetime'' benefit as a recruiting tool.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton-based NCR Corp. last week sent out letters to its
employees and retirees outlining future changes in its health care
benefits plans, which have the reputation of being extraordinarily
rich. In 1999, NCR will go from assuming the total cost of benefits
to requiring workers to contribute a percentage of their paychecks.
Also, employees hired on oR after Jan. 1 will not get retiree
medical coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than a year ago, we began taking a close look at our
health care plans, and we found that they were `out of line' with
comparable companies both inside and outside the markets where we
compete,'' NCR Chairman and Chief Executive Lars Nyberg said in the
letter. Companies such as Andersen Consulting, IBM and the
Hewlett-Packard all require employee contributions for coverage,
Nyberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Nyberg went on to say he remained ``convinced that these
difficult moves are essential for NCR to remain competitive and to
ensure the survival of our company.''
</P>
<P>
   The NCR decision comes as no surprise. In fact, it's a wonder
the company didn't make the move sooner.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 survey by the Washington D.C.-based management consultant
firm William M. Mercer Inc. showed the number of companies offering
retiree health care benefits is declining, down to 31 percent from
39 percent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Employee Benefits Research Institute, also in
Washington D.C., employer spending on group health insurance also
is down. From 1980 to 1990, spending grew from $61 billion to
$188.6 billion, an average annual rate of 11.9 percent. But from
1990 to 1996, the increase in spending dropped to about 5.7 percent
a year, from $188.6 billion to $262.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Ken McDonnell, a research analyst with EBRI, said NCR's move
simply follows a larger trend. ``Companies have started bracing for
the health care costs they are anticipating coming up against,'' he
said. By not asking employees to foot the bill, NCR has been in a
``definite minority.''
</P>
<P>
   Employee benefits experts agree that employees everywhere have
access to far superior health care plans, but they're also paying a
lot more for that coverage. Workers typically spend anywhere from
25 to 35 percent of their paycheck on health care insurance,
depending on the type and size of company and its geographical
location. Coincidentally, the paycheck compensation of NCR
employees opting for single health care coverage next year will
still be far below average at 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, company-sponsored retirement plans such as 401(k)
plans are quickly eclipsing traditional pensions. A recent national
study found the number of companies with more than 100 employees
that offered 401(k) plans nearly doubled from 1994 to 1998. So it's
quite possible these days for big chunks of someone's paycheck to
go toward insurance and retirement costs _ expenses that once were
the sole responsibility of the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend is going toward the cafeteria approach, where the
employee picks up a core level of benefits. Companies are saying,
'anything above that and we'll pay for it,' especially the ones in
large urban areas that can work with networks and (preferred
provider organizations) to manage costs, `` said Kathryn Kennedy,
an assistant professor at John Marshall School of Law in Chicago
and the director of the school's program in employee benefits.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that employers earmarked the majority of benefits
money toward retirement. That has changed, with health care and
dental care plans taking precedent, Kennedy said. ``Benefit
packages are much better, but there's a huge cost associated with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies are well aware of those costs; to offset them, they've
taken steps to create other benefits to ensure the ability to
recruit new employees and to keep current ones from jumping ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies are trying to off-set (the added costs) with
freebie-type benefits such as auto club memberships, discount
tickets to different events, opportunities at shopping clubs,''
said Mary Carl, president of the 415-member Miami Valley Human
Resources Association and herself the human resources director of
the Senior Resource Connection. ``By and large, most are trying to
get very creative with benefit packages, looking at it as total
compensation. They're making it much more attractive to potential
employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Other perks that larger companies are starting to adopt include
flex time, summer hours and additional sick days for emergency
child care.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Chernoff, a managing partner and founder of Chernoff
Diamond, a New York-based benefits advisory firm that provides
strategic advice to mid-sized employers on qualified retirement
plans and health and welfare programs, says it's all about
employers competing for qualified workers. ``There's a need to
reward them in every meaningful respect _ compensation, retirement,
disability/health insurance programs, things such as vacation and
sick time.''
</P>
<P>
   That also mean taking greater care to address the needs of women
and physically challenged employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general terms, benefits have become more
employee-friendly,'' said Alex Jones, human resources manager of
Shopsmith Inc., a locally based power tool company with just over
100 employees. ``There's stiff competition (for workers). One of
the tie-breakers in a lot of instances is the benefits package.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts predict that health care costs for employees will
continue to creep up. But that's probably the only certainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until there's relief from the federal government _ which could
be a good thing or bad _ the companies are going to shift more and
more of the cost burden to employees,'' Carl said. On the flip
side, however, workers will take more ownership of what their
benefits packages look like.
</P>
<P>
   And that will likely be dictated by the Baby Boomer generation,
whose members want great health care now and great retirement
benefits when they begin leaving the work force shortly, Kennedy
said. She added that a continued push toward universal health care
would not surprise her.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, it will be expensive, Kennedy said. ``The cost
is becoming so dramatically higher. It's got to come out of
somebody's pocket.''

 &HT;    Fraud trial of former professor begins Monday
 &HT;    By Carrie Teegardin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Dr. Richard Borison, once a high-profile professor at
the Medical College of Georgia, is set to go on trial Monday in
Augusta to face charges that he masterminded a research scam and
stole more than $10 million from the college.
</P>
<P>
   The central issue in the long-awaited trial will be whether the
case even belongs in a criminal court.
</P>
<P>
   Borison's attorney will argue that the researcher didn't steal a
dime, that he earned all of the $10 million in payments from
pharmaceutical companies through private contracts that had nothing
to do with the Medical College. But the state will argue that
Borison was required to funnel all research grants through the
college and that when he didn't, he was stealing.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Borison and his former research partner
stunned the Augusta academic community and cast a shadow over the
administration of the Medical College. The college responded by
creating a new department to keep closer tabs on its researchers,
their grant money and the human subjects participating in trials.
State and federal agencies also opened investigations to determine
whether patients were harmed.
</P>
<P>
   A Boston native, Borison was chairman of the college's
Department of Psychiatry and one of its most respected faculty
members when administrators learned in 1996 that he was running
clinical drug trials, without their knowledge, that might be
jeopardizing the safety of patients.
</P>
<P>
   Borison and his research partner, Bruce Diamond, were charged
last year in a 172-count indictment with theft, making false
statements, bribery, racketeering, tax evasion and other crimes
after an investigation by the Georgia attorney general's office. In
a separate civil action, the state is suing Borison to recover more
than $5 million in assets from his corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The subject is money
</P>
<P>
   The investigation concluded that Borison and Diamond, a former
MCG pharmacology professor, stole from the college by setting up a
research operation near the campus in a private office staffed in
part with college employees.
</P>
<P>
   The two men got dozens of contracts for experimental drug
studies with many of the nation's top pharmaceutical companies,
then pocketed millions of dollars from the research grants rather
than funneling the money through the college's research institute,
investigators said. College policies required researchers to inform
the college of research proposals, share research funds with the
college's research institute and get approval from an ethics board
for projects involving human subjects. Investigators found more
than $10 million in grants dating back to 1988 that they contend
should have gone to the college. ``This is one of the largest
cases, in terms of amounts of money involved, that we have ever
handled,'' said Attorney General Thurbert Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Borison used the money, investigators said, to live an upscale
life in which he traveled and lectured internationally, collected
expensive antiques from auction houses and planned to build a $4.5
million, 11,000-square foot ``castle'' to house his collection.
Borison kept a model of the building in his office.
</P>
<P>
   Diamond pleaded guilty in December to a variety of charges,
including 26 counts of theft. He was sentenced to five years in
prison and 10 years' probation and fined $125,000. He agreed to
make restitution of $1.1 million to the college and to testify
against his former partner at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Augusta attorney Michael C. Garrett, Borison's lawyer, will
argue that Borison was, in essence, moonlighting. The contracts
were made between pharmaceutical manufacturers and private
companies created and run by Borison and Diamond, and the checks
were made out to them, not the Medical College.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funds which the state of Georgia has accused Dr. Borison
of stealing are the proceeds of outside research that he did,''
Garrett said in an interview last week. ``This was never the
property of the Medical College of Georgia Research Institute to
begin with. I don't know of any legal basis for them to say it's
theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial will focus almost exclusively on money. But the
attorney general's investigation and inquiries by other agencies
concluded that Borison's research operation also put human subjects
at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Risks involved
</P>
<P>
   Borison won contracts because he was good at finding people
willing to try experimental medications, which the drug companies
need to prove to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that their
products are safe and effective.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the trials were for people with Alzheimer's disease,
schizophrenia and certain psychiatric conditions. Some patients
responded to advertisements, while others were recruited at the
Augusta Veterans Affairs Medical Center, where Borison had
privileges.
</P>
<P>
   The patients and their families often came to Borison's office
desperate for help with hopeless conditions. Most were certain that
the Medical College of Georgia was overseeing the studies.
</P>
<P>
   But later investigations have found that enrolling large numbers
of patients in drug studies often was a higher priority than the
patients' health:
</P>
<P>
   An FDA investigation observed 20 violations of research rules,
including a failure to report serious side effects, enrolling
patients who did not fit study requirements and allowing
unqualified employees to perform medical tasks. Researchers also
failed to properly obtain informed consent from some patients, the
cornerstone of ethical research. The FDA has not issued a final
report.
</P>
<P>
   A Veterans Affairs investigation found that vulnerable patients
were coerced to enroll in trials by promises of money, that
research workers with no medical training were given signed
prescription pads and allowed to order controlled substances, and
that some patients were enrolled in studies without being properly
informed of the risks.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Advocacy Office, a government-appointed watchdog
organization for people with psychiatric conditions, still is
investigating the way patients were handled. But the organization
has been hampered by state officials' refusal to allow the release
of patients' records that the group says it is legally entitled to.
The GAO is taking legal action to try to secure the records.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people were damaged and it's our duty to look into abuse
and neglect,'' said Joyce Ringer, executive director of the
Advocacy Office. ``They were vulnerable and they did not get good
care.''
</P>
<P>
   Many family members of patients in the Borison trials were
shocked to find out they were being run outside of the Medical
College and that unqualfied staff people had been in charge of the
care.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel like the Medical College is kind of a front and
that they're not really keeping tabs on what's going on,'' said
Janis Huckeba, whose husband Lewis was enrolled in a study of an
Alzheimer's drug.
</P>
<P>
   Huckeba, who had always held the Medical College in esteem, said
Borison and his staff abandoned her when her husband became
extremely agitated and paranoid, even when he took a loaded gun and
refused to relinquish it. When she called the research office for
help, she said, Diamond offered nothing, telling her to go to her
private physician.
</P>
<P>
   Huckeba had been assured when her husband enrolled that the
doctors and college would handle any medical problems. Huckeba
later became infuriated when she found out that research assistants
who took charge of her husband's care and saw him during his
regulation visits had no medical training.
</P>
<P>
   What is Huckeba hoping for from the jury who hears Borison's
case?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see him pay for what he's done,'' Huckeba said.
``He has used people to pad his own pocket.

 &HT;    Age-old virtues
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Kurylo
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_ His hair is pure silver. His face is lined with
wrinkles. At the end of a long day, his weariness occasionally
betrays him and becomes obvious.
</P>
<P>
   But as his 74th birthday approaches, Jimmy Carter shows no signs
of slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, the former president spent a week building
Habitat for Humanity houses in Houston, visited 13 countries to
promote peace and human rights and made more than 100 speeches
across the globe. He taught Sunday school in Plains two to three
times a month; lectured at Emory University, where he is a
distinguished professor; and finished writing his 14th book, which
is to be published next month.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, Rosalynn, his wife of 52 years, was by his
side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we stay as busy as we ever did,'' the former president
said in an interview at his Carter Center office in Atlanta, where
he spends about a week each month. ``We're both in good health.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who turns 74 on Thursday, tackles the topic of aging in
his new book, ``The Virtues of Aging'' (Ballantine, $9.95,
paperback only). If you have good health, growing old gracefully is
simply a matter of having a positive attitude, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A person is old when one thinks he or she is old'' and begins
to depend on others, Carter said. It's important to approach each
day with ``an inquisitive attitude,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Each day offers the chance to ``learn more about God's world,
learn more about other people, learn more about myself, do
challenging, interesting, exciting and unpredictable things,'' said
Carter, who still rises before dawn and works several hours before
breakfast. ``We have a unique capability when we reach retirement
age, an element of freedom we haven't had before, because in the
past we were pursuing a career, or trying to earn enough money for
our families or for retirement and security in our old age. But
then we reach a point where we don't have all those duties. What do
we do with our life?''
</P>
<P>
   Carter was 56 when he was ``involuntarily retired'' from the
White House. The defeat was painful, and his return to Plains was
depressing. ``We felt that nothing could replace the four more
years that I had anticipated spending as the nation's president,''
he says in his new book. ``Rosalynn was especially bitter and
angry, unable to accept with equanimity the result of the 1980
election.''
</P>
<P>
   He figured he had about 25 years left, considering that he
expected to make it to 80. He wrote his memoirs; she wrote her
autobiography. Then they worked together to establish the Carter
Center, a think tank linked to Emory University in Atlanta, which
is their home base for programs to improve health, agriculture,
democracy and human rights around the world. For years they
traveled the world, monitoring elections, convening peace talks
between combatants and seeking to improve the health of
impoverished people in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   When they entered their 70s (Mrs. Carter turned 71 in August),
they had to face the fact that both fit almost any definition of
``old age.'' But neither feels old.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were out running together yesterday. We ran three miles,''
Carter said, adding that he used to run seven miles a day as
president. ``The day before yesterday we played two vigorous sets
of tennis. We ride our bicycles often.''
</P>
<P>
   They also watch what they eat and enjoy fly-fishing, mountain
climbing, hiking, skiing and bird-watching. He also likes to hunt
and work in his wood shop at home. The Carters relish the time
spent with their nine grandchildren and try to gather everyone
together for a family vacation every year between Christmas and New
Year's.
</P>
<P>
   Both still write books. Her latest is ``Helping Someone With
Mental Illness: A Compassionate Guide for Family, Friends and
Caregivers'' (Times Books, $24). It's part of her nearly 30-year
crusade to fight the stigma associated with mental illness. He's
halfway through a novel set in the Revolutionary War.
</P>
<P>
   Family friend Betty Pope of Americus says she and her husband,
John, have encouraged the Carters to slow down, but ``I just don't
think they like to stay still.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimmy will ride his bike some nine miles from his house to the
farm to go fishing, even in the heat,'' she said. ``My husband
fussed at him for doing that. But they both just stay on the go.
... They have a great deal of stamina.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Ariail, pastor of Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains,
where the Carters worship and teach Sunday school, said they show
no signs of slowing down. ``I just turned 60 and I can't keep up
with them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jody Powell, Carter's former press secretary, said Carter will
stay as active as he can for as long as he can. ``He truly enjoys
what he is doing,'' Powell said. ``He seems to me to be about as
happy and involved and excited about life as I can ever remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Carter said she is so busy that she doesn't think about
aging. ``I think having something to do and having things that you
need to do and want to do'' is important, she said. ``I don't see
any difference in our schedule or what we do now.''
</P>
<P>
   Both use laptop computers to keep in touch with friends and
family through e-mail. They also use the Internet to research and
write their books and read newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't get the daily papers in Plains,'' Carter said, ``but
I read the newspapers (on the Internet) first thing when I get
up.''
</P>
<P>
   They acknowledge that they are phasing down their day-to-day
involvement in the Carter Center and are preparing for retirement.
``We haven't set a specific time,'' Carter said, ``but I don't
think there's any doubt that everyone at the Carter Center knows
that our involvement is inexorably becoming less and less on a
personal basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter said several people will split the lead roles at his
think tank when he retires.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leadership of the Carter Center will not be taken over by
one person,'' he said. ``We're making very careful plans to have
people take over all the responsibilities that we have now.''
</P>
<P>
   It probably won't happen anytime soon, Betty Pope predicts.
``They'll just keep on going until they can't,'' she said.

 &HT;    In Congress, crucial bills pushed aside
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the eve of the public release of Ken Starr's
report to Congress, a chagrined President Clinton summoned Senate
Democrats to the White House to apologize for the Monica Lewinsky
scandal and the way it crippled the Democratic Party's agenda, from
managed care reform to tobacco legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told each of us in a very personal way that he had let us
down,'' recalled Sen. Robert Torricelli (D-N.J.). ``It was more
than an apology. It was an expression that he knew that he had
disappointed us and caused us problems that we didn't deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   With Starr's report to Congress now more than 2 weeks old and
the House consumed with the prospect of impeachment hearings, it is
increasingly clear that the fallout from the presidential crisis
isn't limited to the Democrats alone.
</P>
<P>
   Preoccupation with impeachment at both ends of Pennsylvania
Avenue is delaying crucial spending bills. The deepening
partisanship from both parties all but assures there will be few
compromises on any major legislation _ from tax cuts to health care
_ before Congress is scheduled to adjourn Oct. 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to keep a focus, but it's pretty hard to do with
everything that is going on over here,'' conceded Senate majority
leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) on Friday. Lott said he hadn't spoken
to the president since Aug. 20 and said ``normal communication''
with the White House was much less than in previous sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Some also are sounding alarms over the toll that impeachment
will take on the long-term issues facing the country, such as the
troubled global financial markets, the still unresolved problem of
chemical weapons in Iraq and the potential for all-out war in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are issues that cry out for attention here on Capitol
Hill,'' said Sen. Max Cleland (D-Ga.). ``Unfortunately, it seems
that all this year has been one big Jerry Springer show.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamenting the heightened partisanship over impeachment, Sen.
Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) warned in a Senate speech Thursday that ``the
Congress, the presidency and the Constitution itself may suffer
damage that will linger long after we are gone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You are not only going to end up badly damaging the Congress,
but we are going to have relationships of trust and respect built
up over a decade, especially among senior members, that will be
destroyed,'' Leahy said after his remarks. ``And then the Congress
will not be able to work in the times we have to rise up above
party politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Pre-election battle plans
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans largely dismiss such concerns, saying
it is the Democrats, not the GOP, who have been partisan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats are trying to shift the attention,'' said Sen. Larry
Craig (R-Idaho), a member of the Senate leadership. ``They are in
desperate straits right now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in their political best interests to make this
partisan,'' said Rep. John Linder (R-Ga.). ``As they see the damage
the White House is causing their party in the elections, they have
got to find a way to respond to that. The best way is to blame the
other party for all that's happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Republicans and Democrats had drawn up their pre-election
battle plans well before Starr's report reached Congress.
Republicans planned to return from the August recess, finish work
on the spending bills, pass some sort of tax cut and go home.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats had planned to trumpet all the legislation Republicans
were blocking, such as campaign finance reform, greater protection
for consumers in health maintenance organizations and the
president's plan to finance 100,000 new teachers and reduce class
sizes.
</P>
<P>
   But the distraction of impeachment has derailed both strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has made it difficult for our candidates out in their
districts to talk about the issues we think are important,'' said
Rep. Martin Frost (D-Texas), who heads the Democrats' effort to
regain control of the House. ``The press only wants to talk about
what's going on with President Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, riven with internal disagreements, are struggling
to complete work on the major spending bills. The fiscal year
expires Wednesday and only one of the 13 spending bills has been
signed into law. It is possible Congress may adjourn Oct. 9 with
some of the biggest bills left undone, requiring Congress to pass
stop-gap financing measures to carry the government into 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects for an agreement on tax cuts, a top priority for many
Republicans, is also very much in doubt. Democrats, particularly in
the Senate, are in no mood to deal when their own agenda is being
blocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not the kind of momentum you'd expect a month out
from going home,'' said Rep. Charlie Norwood (R-Ga.), who urged
Clinton to resign so impeachment would not impede Congress' other
business. ``My gosh, there ought to be a flurry of activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Managed-care reform, a proposal Norwood has been pushing for
three years, also appears dead, languishing in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I don't have a chance over there because they
can't talk about it or won't bring it up,'' Norwood said. ``I don't
know if (the impeachment controversy) is directly affecting this or
not, but I suspect so. Even if it takes us off target just a little
bit, that's not good.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives also have cause to gripe. Within the span of a
week, the Senate failed to override Clinton's veto of a bill
banning certain late-term abortions and another that would have put
restrictions on minors crossing state lines to receive an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Johnson, legislative director for the National Right to
Life Committee, said the ``background noise'' created by
impeachment ``allowed some senators to vote with the pro-abortion
lobby.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, we are a little frustrated,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   This year's wind-up differs dramatically from the end of the
1996 session, when Congress reached major agreements on welfare
reform, increasing the minimum wage, new clean water standards and
requiring insurers to allow workers to carry their health insurance
from one job to another.
</P>
<P>
   Like all compromises, each side was motivated by self interest.
Clinton needed to show voters he could work with the Republican
majority. Republicans needed to prove they weren't the party of the
far right.

 &HT;    Gingrich walking fine line in handling Clinton inquiry
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Jack Kingston thinks he has a pretty good idea
of what would happen if the House were to shut down its impeachment
review and speedily resolve the case against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The nation as a whole might be grateful, if public opinion polls
are to be believed. But, Kingston (R-Ga.) said, the Republican
Party's ``base would go berserk and leave us in droves.''
</P>
<P>
   The election is 37 days away, and there is no underestimating
the role Nov. 3 plays in the saga unfolding in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Democrats are hoping to minimize their losses.
Republicans want to use the Clinton sex scandal to cement their
majorities in the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But this is the emerging dilemma confronting Speaker Newt
Gingrich: Can he keep the GOP's most motivated constituency, social
conservatives, happy by holding out the prospect of impeachment and
simultaneously assure moderate voters that the House is adhering to
a fair process?
</P>
<P>
   The proposition is a difficult one even for the most skillful
politician, which by most accounts the speaker is.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls indicate that the public does not think Republicans
have treated Clinton fairly. A New York Times/CBS News poll shows a
majority of Americans disapprove of the way the Judiciary Committee
has handled its review of independent counsel Kenneth Starr's
report, and even two-thirds of Republicans say the videotape of
Clinton's testimony should not have been made public.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the same poll also shows that those people most likely to
vote in November prefer Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   And among conservative Republicans, there is strong support for
beginning the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   So Republicans would seem to benefit from continuing on a path
that probably will lead to the start of an impeachment inquiry in
early October.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) reflected Democrats' complaints
about the treatment of the Starr report when he said, ``Republicans
can't even intimate before the election that they won't hold
impeachment hearings.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Kingston said he gets far angrier input from people who
``want to lynch'' Clinton and want Kingston to take an active part
than from constituents who are concerned about a fair process.
</P>
<P>
   But Gingrich's own political history complicates his role.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is suspicion from both liberals and conservatives, and
the moderates don't like him much either,'' said Stuart Rothenberg,
a Washington political analyst. ``He has decided to inject himself
into the process, which makes it an even bigger deal for him.''
</P>
<P>
   At risk may be Gingrich's political future, and a possible
presidential candidacy in 2000, Rothenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The opportunities for the speaker, however, also loom large if
``he can somehow get kudos from conservative Republicans who want
the president to go down in flames and from moderates who are
looking for someone statesmanlike,'' Rothenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich declined to comment on Friday, but Republican
strategists say this notion of a balancing act is misleading.
Gingrich has been at the forefront of a call for the House to do
its constitutional duty, nothing less and nothing more, these
strategists say.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a censure and possible fine for Clinton, which
Democrats floated last week, illustrates their point.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich put an end to such talk when he said the investigation
would be concluded before there would be any talk of punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats cited Gingrich's statement as one more indication that
he was pandering to his party's right wing.
</P>
<P>
   But Rich Galen, a longtime Gingrich ally, said the censure
proposal never struck Republicans as a serious idea. ``A resolution
of condemnation or censure has the same force as a resolution
declaring National Pumpkin Week,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He cast the proposal as another Democratic attempt to divert
attention from the Democrats' real problem, a dispirited core that
appears more likely to sit at home rather than vote this year. If
an artful political compromise to bring Congress' consideration of
Clinton's fate to an end is not possible now, Gingrich might be
more amenable to one after the election, when short-term political
considerations can be expected to wane, Rothenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, a negotiated solution might be preferable to a
``constitutional blood bath,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich has some experience with unusual political settlements.
He accepted a reprimand and $300,000 fine from the House last year
in exchange for being allowed to remain speaker.

 &HT;    Gulf dwellers flee Georges' fury
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GULF SHORES, Ala. _ Hurricane Georges intensified Saturday in
the Gulf of Mexico, and more than a million people in four Gulf
Coast states were evacuated as the increasingly dangerous storm
barreled toward New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   A hurricane warning was in effect along the Gulf Coast from
Morgan City, La., to Panama City, Fla., and residents across much
of that stretch anxiously boarded up their homes and then tried to
leave the coast via gridlocked roadways.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane had sustained winds of 105 mph Saturday. Its
center was expected to reach the mouth of the Mississippi River,
about 75 miles southeast of New Orleans, late today. By that time,
there was a chance the hurricane could have strengthened to a
Category 3 storm, with sustained winds around the center of more
than 111 mph, forecasters said.
</P>
<P>
   Tropical storm-force winds of at least 39 mph were expected to
reach the Gulf Coast by this afternoon. Forecasters also said
Georges could slow as it neared land, drenching the coast with
sustained heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is kind of like looking down the barrel of a shotgun and
hoping it turns,'' said Louisiana State Police Lt. Col. Ronnie
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Bumper-to-bumper traffic lined up on I-10 leaving New Orleans on
Saturday. About 1 million people had been ordered or urged to leave
the city and low-lying coastal areas, but total evacuation would
take an estimated three days, according to authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands more were told to leave coastal sections of
Mississippi, Alabama and the Florida Panhandle.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency officials in Mississippi closed beaches and the 11
casinos on the state's coast. Boats were moved inland from Gulf
marinas.
</P>
<P>
   The Gulf will be Georges' first landfall since leaving a trail
of wreckage along the scenic Florida Keys.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, residents of Key West surveyed the collapsed walls,
missing roofs and other damage wrought by Friday's winds of more
than 100 mph. Broken trees and debris covered many other islands in
the chain, but no deaths were reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coconuts were like cannonballs blowing in the wind,'' said
Davin Kusik, who lives at the Venture Out mobile home park on
Cudjoe Key.
</P>
<P>
   With Georges blamed for more than 300 deaths in the Caribbean,
many residents along the oft-stricken Gulf Coast were not of a mind
to test the fates Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This one has the potential to be bad,'' said Gerald Berg, 58,
working at Pier One Marina in Gulf Breeze, Fla., where plywood
plastered the windows of pastel-colored houses and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ''God does protect drunks and fools, and here we are,'' said
Barbara Barnes, bartender at Flora-Bama Lounge and Package, a
popular haunt in Perdido Key, Fla., which threw a hurricane party
for people who decided to ride out Georges.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency officials said most people heeded evacuation orders,
which stretched for more than 300 miles from Louisiana to the
Florida Panhandle. Powerful Georges' wobbly course in the Gulf of
Mexico prompted the widespread warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Meteorologist Kent Frantz at the National Weather Service in
Peachtree City said Georgia is expected to feel only minimal
effects from Georges. ``Southwest Georgia has a 40 percent chance
of showers and an occasional thunderstorm from Sunday through
Monday,'' he said. The chance of rain in the rest of Georgia is 30
percent or less, with no significant wind velocities.
</P>
<P>
   When Georges slowed Saturday, it reminded people of how previous
storms as far back as Hurricane Frederic in 1979 stalled and
meandered before gaining strength and roaring ashore, causing
widespread damage.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is doing just like Frederic did,'' Addie Page White, 79,
said Saturday as she and her husband, Travis, prepared to evacuate
from Gulf Shores, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   After Frederic, the couple returned to find their beach-front
house gone, except for two pilings. They rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, as they did before hurricanes Erin and Opal in 1995
and Danny last year, the couple evacuated with family pictures and
other keepsakes.
</P>
<P>
   Strong winds in advance of Georges whipped red warning flags in
Orange Beach, Ala., where high-rise hotels and condominiums line
the white-sand beach like dominoes. Most were vacant, as were the
houses and businesses in coastal Baldwin County, at the
southeastern tip of Mobile Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody is taking the storm seriously,'' said Baldwin County
emergency management director Steven Denham, who estimated that
40,000 people evacuated Gulf Shores, Orange Beach and Fort Morgan.
''They remember Danny and the 40 inches of rain it dumped on us.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Hampton Inn in Pensacola Beach, Fla, the staff evacuated
Saturday, but not before nailing up plywood and scrawling on one of
the panels, ''In your eye Georgie's boy!''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Georges stays to the west, the Panhandle could still
suffer because the eastern side of hurricanes hold the most wind
and water.
</P>
<P>
   Evacuation orders had gone out for upwards of 183,000 Panhandle
residents of barrier islands, low-lying areas and mobile homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We debated whether to stay, but decided it would not be vert
smart,'' said Harrell Cushing, 67, who disrupted his Perdido Key,
Fla., vacation to return home to Montgomery, Ala. ''You have to get
out of here before they close the bridges, or you have to sit out
the storms.''
</P>
<P>
   People who live in coastal and other low-lying areas and in
mobile homes scrambled for hotel rooms a few miles inland. Others
showed up at emergency shelters operated by the American Red Cross
and other relief agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said I'd never spend another storm at home,'' said Miriam
Edwards, 74, sipping coffee in the muggy heat outside of the
emergency shelter at Robertsdale High School in Baldwin County,
Ala.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, Harry, 75, rode out Hurricane Danny in
their Orange Beach home in July 1997, and the wind and rain scared
her badly enough to consider moving.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is nerve racking, very nerve racking,'' she said. After
seven feet of water during Hurricane Opal blew through his
Pensacola Beach, Fla., house, Mario Jimenez, 59, began taking
precautions. As he nailed up plywood Saturday, he looked nervously
across the street at a trash dumpster overflowing with scrap lumber
from a house remodeling.
</P>
<P>
   ''That debris will fly like bullets,'' Jimenez said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Hughes, 35, and her fiance, 40-year-old Jimmy Nicholson,
quickly made new arrangements for their wedding Saturday when
Pensacola Beach officials decided to evacuate the town.
</P>
<P>
   The couple canceled the band, but they held the ceremony at
their Gulf Breeze home.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very disappointed, but our families and friends have
made the best of it,'' Hughes said. ''That's all we could do at
this point.''

 &HT;    Clinton, prosecutors speak it _ it's courtroom coin of realm
 &HT;    By Jay Croft
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Did you hear the one about the homemaker, the
accountant and the lawyer?
</P>
<P>
   Each was asked, ``What's the sum of two and two?''
</P>
<P>
   The homemaker said, ``Four!''
</P>
<P>
   The accountant said, ``It's either three or four _ let me run my
spreadsheet again and I'll get back to you.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer turned out the light, huddled close and whispered,
``What do you want it to be?''
</P>
<P>
   As the intricate details of the war of words between President
Clinton and independent counsel Kenneth Starr have come into public
view, many Americans are scoffing at legal distinctions they see as
just more doublespeak from Spin City lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   But in many ways, some attorneys and experts say, the case
reveals how lawyers, defendants and witnesses proceed
linguistically in court every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people say it's legal mumbo jumbo, this is important
legal mumbo jumbo,'' said Atlanta attorney Craig Gillen, who was a
prosecutor in the Iran-Contra investigation. ``Words mean
everything. Words are exceedingly important.''
</P>
<P>
   Semantic precision is vital, even in the most ordinary legal
situations _ from rental agreements to police search warrants to
the tax code's definition of ``income.''
</P>
<P>
   And in a situation of unprecedented embarrassment, no one has
shown a keener awareness of that than Clinton lately. In his speech
to the nation Aug. 17, Clinton insisted that his deposition in
Paula Jones's sexual harassment suit had been ``legally accurate''
but conceded he misled people about his involvement with former
intern Monica Lewinsky. And in his grand jury testimony televised
last week, Clinton told an inquisitor that an answer ``depends on
what your definition of 'is' is.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans also have seen Starr's team repeatedly ask the same
question in slightly different form, leading some to sympathize
with Clinton for apparently being nit-picked into a corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``People unfamiliar (with legal proceedings) would see it as
trifling on both sides, but it is a very serious matter,''
explained Joseph DiGenova of Washington, D.C., a former U.S.
attorney and independent counsel. ``The lawyering on both sides is
quite classic, in the sense that this is the way things are, this
is the way things work.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 25 years ago, as Watergate was closing in, President Nixon
offered a classically straightforward, if tragically ironic,
defense: ``I am not a crook.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans since have grown more savvy and cynical, through
exposure to legal proceedings via cable TV and other media, from
Judge Wopner to C-SPAN to the biggest court TV event of them all,
the O.J. Simpson murder trial.
</P>
<P>
   And in this media age, it's the Simpson case that Clinton's
troubles most resemble, with their unyielding coverage and instant
analyses, in many ways more than Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes in the glare of the spotlight, it's not pretty,''
said Kent Alexander of Atlanta, a former U.S. attorney now in
private practice. ``Lawyers often move on technicalities and cases
are made on technicalities. A lot of what's going on (in the
Clinton case) is not unusual'' in the sense of attorneys' and
participants' choosing their words with extreme care.
</P>
<P>
   But many people still are shocked and disillusioned at the
president's hairsplitting, with citizens and congressmen in both
parties saying that the president should speak more directly to the
truth than, perhaps, to the exact wording of his inquisitors.
</P>
<P>
   Even at Yale, Clinton's law school alma mater, scholars said
last week they are not responsible for his legal interpretations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you have to tell the truth,'' said Law School Dean
Anthony Townsed Kronman, a 1975 graduate who was an acquaintance
of Clinton's at the school. ``It has to be part of your
professional character, and it is not something that can be taught
by putting it down in a rule book and handing it to students.''
</P>
<P>
   Professor Kate Stith said, ``I worry, do we teach you that all
that counts is your brains, your creativity? I worry that we teach
you the Constitution means whatever you can make it mean.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you lie under oath if there are no lies, if words have
no meaning, if ... it all depends on what the meaning of the word
`is' is?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Simpson's trial was muddied by the power of celebrity,
by race and by a judge criticized for lack of control, so has
Clinton's case been clouded by the power of his office, by politics
and by a prosecutor criticized for showing little discretion.
</P>
<P>
   For example, no one has to appear before a grand jury when he or
she is the target of an investigation, yet Clinton chose to do so.
Similarly, he could have pleaded the Fifth Amendment to avoid
incriminating himself.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's political concerns outweighed the advice of his
attorneys, observers say, and led to his grand jury appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone giving testimony must answer truthfully. And lawyers
always advise their clients to answer only the questions they are
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, people get in trouble by volunteering
information,'' Alexander said. ``Even in a deposition, you can
plead the Fifth.''
</P>
<P>
   The burden, experts say, is on the questioner, and not on the
witness to help him. Clinton told the grand jury he tried to speak
truthfully in the Jones case without helping his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's normal'' to have everyone carefully analyze questions
and answers, said Bruce Yannett, a New York attorney who worked in
the office of the independent counsel during Iran-Contra.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I ask who you talked to yesterday, and you say your mother,
that would be a truthful and accurate answer,'' Yannett said. ``But
if I don't ask you who else, I'm stuck with your answer, and the
fact that I didn't ferret out that you spoke to 10 other people is
really my fault,'' Yannett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saying `Tell me everyone you spoke with yesterday' is
different than `Who did you speak with yesterday?'''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers failed to follow up
</P>
<P>
   During Clinton's deposition in the Jones case, Yannett said,
Jones' attorneys did a poor job of following up. ``You didn't see
questions like, `Did you say anything else? Was anyone else
present? Did you speak to anyone else?'''
</P>
<P>
   And it wasn't Clinton's job to ``clarify the question,'' even on
the now infamous definition ``sexual relations'' he was given,
Gillen said. ``I don't care if you're the president of the United
States or the grand poobah of the Elks Club.''
</P>
<P>
   What, then, is perjury? It's not just lying under oath.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to lie, and you have to lie about something that
really matters'' to the case, Alexander said. ``You have to have
the intent of misleading.''
</P>
<P>
   So although Clinton lied in the since-dismissed Jones case, that
might not be legally relevant in Starr's investigation into whether
Clinton had an affair with Lewinsky and then tried to cover it up.
Still, it gave Starr a reason for getting so specific in Clinton's
grand jury testimony, when the president repeatedly perjured
himself again, Starr charged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lying is a very big deal,'' DiGenova said. ``Once that's the
game _ is he telling the truth? _ then it becomes absolutely
essential that there be extremely detailed questions.''
</P>
<P>
   That means questions from lawyers, with answers shaped, at least
in part, by them.
</P>
<P>
   And, as Georgia State University law professor Roy Sobelson put
it, ``The way people talk in their everyday language is not the
same way that lawyers are trained to talk.''

 &HT;    Feds hope bear hunters can sniff out Rudolph
 &HT;    By Kathy Scruggs
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Birmingham bombing suspect Eric Robert Rudolph is a
loner _ a man who, investigators say, enjoys the chase and is so
determined to elude capture that they fear he may construct a
suicide bomb rather than go to prison.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, bear hunters are gregarious, adventuresome,
persistent and cunning _ all driven by the thrill of the hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials hope that by pitting those characteristics
against each other _ the doggedness of the bear hunters against the
stealth of the suspect _ they finally may catch the fugitive
Rudolph, or at least unearth more clues.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 12, the Nantahala Forest, including the 30-square-mile
area where investigators are concentrating their search, will be
crawling with hunters and their wily hounds searching for wild boar
and black bear.
</P>
<P>
   It's a dangerous game made even more so by the specter of one of
the FBI's Ten Most Wanted fugitives being among the prey.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, at 7 p.m. in the Andrews, N.C., recreation center,
members of the Southeast Bomb Task Force will have a meeting with
the hunters to enlist their help. There are no plans to restrict
access to any of the forest, FBI agent Terry Turchie said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to impart to them that they could really help us,''
Turchie said.
</P>
<P>
   Hunters will be shown the brands of vitamins and food _
including Bi-Lo oatmeal, green beans, raisins and Planters peanuts
_ that they know Rudolph carried into the woods with him. Some of
the containers have been found buried.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they find something in an area that doesn't seem to fit _
call us,'' Turchie said. The task force information number is
1-828- 321-1336.
</P>
<P>
   From clues gathered, investigators then will determine what to
send to the lab in an effort to chart a trail of the fugitive's
movements. Officials also want to warn hunters of the potential
danger of mixing hunters, bounty hunters and investigators and
their guns, Turchie said, adding that anyone who bears a
resemblance to Rudolph may be questioned, and such people should
not be offended. A pickup truck registered to Rudolph was seen near
the site of the Jan. 29 explosion at a Birmingham abortion clinic
that killed a moonlighting police officer and maimed a nurse.
</P>
<P>
   He disappeared shortly after and wasn't seen again until months
later, when an acquaintance said he came out of the woods and made
off with a large quantity of food and supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Bounty hunters
</P>
<P>
   The hunt for Rudolph has not been popular among bounty hunters,
said Lewis Nachamkin, a fugitive recovery agent in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   For those who go, the hook is the fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you get this guy and give money away to charity, you
will be world famous for about 10 minutes,'' he said. ``Then you
can put it on your resume that you're the guy who pulled in Eric
Rudolph.''
</P>
<P>
   Bounty hunters, however, have run into many obstacles from law
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, you're not welcomed up there,'' Nachamkin said.
``And the terrain is terrible to negotiate, and this guy is
supposed to be an explosives expert,'' he added.``I'm sure he's got
booby traps set up.''
</P>
<P>
   While many bounty hunters have left the area after a July
sighting of Rudolph, this fall is the first time the itinerant
carpenter has been forced to match wits with bear hunters. The
spring and summer brought campers, hikers, rafters and turkey
hunters, who all tend to stay on trails, said David Allen, wildlife
management technician with the N.C. Wildlife Resource Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bear hunters use the deep woods like rafters and hikers use
the pathways,'' he said. ``They go where there are no pathways.
They go into areas that other people only look at from afar.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen's job is to monitor the black bear population of about
2,000 that wander the steep slopes and crags in the area where
investigators are searching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked with a lot of bear hunters, and they haven't seen
this bird,'' Allen said. ``This guy is supposed to have spent
months in the woods, yet nobody ever remembered seeing him.
Apparently, he's acted like a fugitive all these years, or he
didn't spend the time in the woods they think he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen said Rudolph will be up against real woodsmen when the
hunting season begins. ``They know how to move in the woods,''
Allen said. ``They look for tracks, evidence of animals. They can
look for evidence of humans as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Nachamkin, the Atlanta fugitive recovery agent, said he's
satisfied to sit back and observe the manhunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't afford six months up there looking for this guy,'' he
said.

EAST HOLDS KEY TO KOHL'S FATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DRESDEN, Germany _ Standing in the rubble that once was
Frauenkirche, the Church of Our Lady, Helmut Kohl had his political
epiphany nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He looked out at a sea of East Germans, and he promised them
``flourishing landscapes.'' They would, he vowed, share the
prosperity of the West. They would, he promised, escape the losses
rained upon them by the Allied bombs of late World War II, which
leveled Frauenkirche and the rest of Dresden, and which preceded
the division of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl's plea for unity brought cheers to the throats of East
Germans, and tears to his eyes. By his own admission, the
enthusiastic embrace he received outside the Frauenkirche gave a
spiritual purpose to what had been a largely pragmatic political
career.
</P>
<P>
   As Germans vote Sunday, it is the East in general, and Dresden
in particular, that could decide whether Kohl retains his post as
chancellor for an unprecedented fifth four-year term.
</P>
<P>
   According to polls, Kohl's conservative Christian Democrats are
a few percentage points behind the liberal Social Democrats, led by
his challenger, Gerhard Schroeder. Statistically, the race is a
dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 11 states of the former West Germany, voting patterns
have deviated little in the past half-dozen general elections. But
in what used to be East Germany, unemployment is about double the
10.7 percent national figure, and everything, including voting
habits, is more volatile here.
</P>
<P>
   In the last general election four years ago, Kohl's party took
46 percent of the vote in Saxony, one of the five states of the
former East Germany _ almost double what Schroeder's party
received. In Dresden, Saxony's capital, Kohl's party took 45
percent to the Social Democrats' 18 percent. The gap was wider in
1990, when Kohl took 54 percent in Saxony to the Social Democrats'
19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If Schroeder can narrow that gap _ and many people here think he
can _ he will return the Social Democrats to power for the first
time in 16 years. Even if Kohl prevails, he could be forced to form
a coalition government with the Social Democrats. Polls have found
that most Germans favor such an arrangement. Kohl has vowed to
resign rather than participate in it.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the East could send Kohl, its self-appointed savior,
packing.
</P>
<P>
   The election is critical not only to Germany's 80 million
people, but to Europe, where Kohl is the undisputed leader of the
European Union as it embarks on its most ambitious venture _ the
conversion to a single currency.
</P>
<P>
   The election is also important to an international community
that, stung by economic crises in Russia, Japan, and South America,
seeks stability in the world markets where the German mark rivals
the US dollar as the leading currency.
</P>
<P>
   But as Tip O'Neill observed, all politics is local. Sunday's
vote seems destined to be decided by who Germans believe is best
equipped to lead them from the economic uncertainty into the next
millennium: Kohl, the longest-serving leader in Europe, or
Schroeder, the governor of Lower Saxony, which despite what its
name implies is actually north and west of Saxony.
</P>
<P>
   Once the most self-assured of Europeans, Germans seem unsettled
these days. Some saw the June crash of a high-speed commuter train
in Eschede that killed 102 people as compelling evidence that
Germany could not rest on its reputation for precision. Such
anxiety may explain why polls this week showed that 25 to 30
percent of voters were still undecided.
</P>
<P>
   While Kohl harps on the past, especially his stewardship of
reunification and the decision to join the single European
currency, Schroeder points to the future and charges that Kohl is
incapable of taking Germany there.
</P>
<P>
   Following the examples of President Bill Clinton and Prime
Minister Tony Blair, an American and a Briton who broke
conservative strangleholds on power by moving their dogmatically
liberal parties to the center, Schroeder has been purposely vague
on plans for a Germany that might be fundamentally different from
the Christian Democratic vision.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders seem wary of his promises to crack down on
generous worker benefits, such as six weeks of vacation each year,
and on a welfare state that has almost bankrupted the social
security system. Schroeder's lead, which in March stood at 12
points in most polls, has slipped this month as Kohl, a tireless
campaigner, has pulled out all the stops.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this campaign has been long on slogans and short on
specifics about how to tackle unemployment and the loss of
competitiveness that has weakened Germany's position as Europe's
most envied economy. Helmut Schmidt, the last of Schroeder's
predecessors to serve as chancellor, has described the campaign as
the most superficial in German history. TV and wardrobe consultants
have never wielded so much influence.
</P>
<P>
   Now 68, Kohl declares without a hint of irony that this is ``the
last battle of the '68-er generation,'' a reference to the
revolutionary movement of 1968 led by radical students, some of
whom are Schroeder's advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder, 54, is as handsome, telegenic, and suave as Kohl is
double-chinned and stammering. But Kohl has always been
underestimated by his opponents. And unlike Kohl, the most enduring
of democratic world leaders, Schroeder is unproven on anything but
a provincial stage. Not surprisingly, he dismisses Kohl's politics
as dated.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Dresden, however, as in much of Germany, the past is
inescapable. Reunification has dramatically improved the roads and
has replaced the dreary gray buildings of the communist era with
pastel facades, notably a ubiquitous salmon pink that adorns many
an apartment front.
</P>
<P>
   But some people here complain that the changes are, like the
paint, mostly cosmetic, and that west Germans have not embraced
them with open arms and open pocketbooks, as Kohl promised.
Instead, they consider as stingy the amount of money and assistance
sent here from the German government. They worry that growing
alienation is driving disenfranchised young people into the arms of
extremist groups.
</P>
<P>
   With a population of about 500,000, Dresden is roughly the size
of Boston. It is the capital of Saxony, which, with a population of
nearly 5 million, contains almost a third of the people who used to
be East Germans.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, a year after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the
distinction between West and East Germans was to have been erased
in the merger of East and West. But, by most accounts, there still
are two Germanys: the more affluent and free-market oriented west,
and the former communist east, where, Kohl's promises outside the
Frauenkirche notwithstanding, progress has been slower than many
here had expected.
</P>
<P>
   Razed by Allied bombs in 1945, Dresden is a resilient,
culturally refined city with a glorious history. After the war, it
experienced the deprivations imposed by a communist regime. It then
emerged as the top tourist destination in the former East Germany.
</P>
<P>
   But because of its geographical isolation in the southeast
corner of the country, Dresden was the only East German city that
did not pick up West German television stations. As a result, the
cultural separation here seems more pronounced.
</P>
<P>
   Just a mile from the stunning Semper Opera House of Dresden is
Neustadt, a section of Dresden that has experienced the polar
extremes of reunification.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Claus-Peter Dippel sat on a stone wall in Martin
Luther Square, drawing hard on a cigarette. He declined to say whom
he would vote for, but he betrayed his sympathies when asked if
life has been better since reunification.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can guarantee you I will not vote for Kohl. I lost my job
and my apartment because of reunification,'' said the 69-year-old
former chemist. ``At night, you don't dare go out, because of the
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   But neither will Dippel vote for Schroeder, whom he regards
merely as a different shade of capitalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schroeder is slick. But he offers no fundamental change,''
Dippel said. ``Not everything was good before reunification. But
the right to work, to an apartment, to education, was guaranteed.
These are fundamental rights no longer valued here. There is only
one yardstick now, and it is money.''

HOUSE ENDORSES $80 BILLION TAX CUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With its eye on the November elections, the
Republican-led House voted Saturday to reduce taxes by $80 billion
over five years, drawing protests from President Clinton and other
Democrats who want to reserve the money for Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which would cut taxes on death, marriage, businesses,
and school construction, was approved in a 229-195 vote, largely
along party lines. &UR;  &LR;  It faces dim prospects in the Senate, and
Clinton Saturday renewed his vow to veto it, should it reach his
desk.
</P>
<P>
   Still, debating the tax measure enabled both parties to preview
the arguments they will take to the voters before the Nov. 3
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said they want the tax cuts _ House minority leader
Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri called them ``very desirable'' _
but at the same time attacked Republicans for funding them from the
nation's expected budget surplus. Democrats say that money should
be reserved until lawmakers find a way to shore up the Social
Security system, which faces insolvency in about 2029.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican tax plan drains billions of dollars from the
surplus before we have done the hard work of strengthening Social
Security,'' Clinton said while on a fund-raising trip to
California. ``First things first.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans argued that taxes are so high that the government
can repair Social Security while returning some money to taxpayers.
On Friday, House Republicans approved a plan to set aside $1.4
trillion for Social Security, or 90 percent of the estimated $1.6
trillion in surpluses expected over the next decade. The remaining
surplus could be spent on a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social Security is a manufactured argument on their part this
year for political reasons,'' said Representative Bill Archer of
Texas, chairman of the House tax-writing committee. ``My liberal
Democratic friends never want to be for tax relief. There is always
a reason it shouldn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, however, are wary of the charge that they might
damage Social Security. Last week, the AFL-CIO began running
$500,000 of radio and television ads in 20 House districts that
attack Republicans for the tax cut and suggest that Social Security
benefits might be reduced. In 1996, similar ads that claimed the
Republican Party was out to destroy Medicare helped Democrats in
the election.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans Saturday won votes from 19 Democrats for the tax
cut, far short of the number needed to override a veto. Eleven
Republicans voted against the tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats cited the vote as proof that the party has
regained momentum before the fall elections, despite the prospect
of impeachment proceedings against Clinton over his affair with
Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic votes for the tax cut were far fewer than the 40
to 60 defections that were considered possible two weeks ago, said
Representative Richard E. Neal of Springfield, Mass. Democrats
stayed in the fold, he said, because they liked the party's use of
the Social Security argument against tax cuts, and because the
president seems to be bouncing back from his personal and political
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely, you can sense the fortunes of the president
rebounding, and if we can get the message back to Social Security
and Medicare, we will do well,'' Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   The tax bill allowed Republicans to extend a hand to some of
their core constituencies. Aiding businesses, the bill would revive
a tax credit for research that expired in June. It would allow
small businesses to write off more expenses. It would speed up an
already-planned cut in estate taxes incurred at death, and would
allow self-employed people to deduct the full cost of their health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also would save state and local governments money
when they issue bonds to build public schools.
</P>
<P>
   However, the plan is far smaller than the original tax cut
proposed by some Republicans, which might have been as large as
$700 billion. It also includes no cut in capital-gains taxes and
does not eliminate the death tax altogether, two top priorities of
business lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   The tax bill also aims to reduce the so-called ``marriage
penalty,'' a quirk in the tax code that forces about 42 percent of
married couples to pay higher income taxes than they would if they
merely lived together as single people.
</P>
<P>
   This feature of the tax code has troubled lawmakers for years,
but it is hard to fix without making other elements of the tax laws
less fair. Eliminating the penalty is a top priority for
Republicans, and party leaders touted their efforts two weeks ago
at the Christian Coalition annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But just as some people pay a tax penalty for marriage, about
half of all couples receive a bonus, meaning they pay lower taxes
as a married couple than they would as two single people. The House
plan would give those families a tax cut as well. When the Senate
debated a marriage penalty plan earier this year, several senators
opposed spending money to help families that already receive a
bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Under the House bill, the average annual tax cut for all married
couples would be $243.
</P>
<P>
   While the House Republican plan is unlikely to become law,
Congress may pass a more modest tax bill this year. There is broad
support for extending several tax breaks that expired, such as the
research credit for businesses. And on Wednesday, Senate Democratic
leader Thomas Daschle of South Dakota said he would offer a $25
billion tax cut aimed at reducing the marriage penalty, easing the
cost of health insurance for the unemployed, and helping farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said he would propose spending cuts so that his tax cut
did not drain the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Economists and budget analysts differed on whether the House tax
cut was a wise idea, but they agreed that it would have only a
small effect on the $8 trillion-a-year US economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's small potatoes,'' said Murray Weidenbaum, who was
chief economic adviser to President Reagan and now heads the Center
for the Study of American Business at Washington University in St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``But at the same time, the timing is right for a tax cut,'' he
said. With much of Asia in recession and the world in economic
turmoil, the House plan would allow US consumers to spend more
money, spurring economic activity.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Reischauer, a former Congressional Budget Office director
who is now with the Brookings Institution, took a far less
charitable view of the House plan. ``It's bad tax policy. It's bad
budget policy, and bad macroeconomic policy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reischauer said the marriage penalty provision was a windfall
for people who already receive a marriage bonus. And a measure that
exludes $200 in interest or dividend income from taxes, or $400 for
couples, is so small that it would not prompt anyone to save or
invest more, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Recent CBO figures show that, at least in the next few years,
any budget surpluses would be created by the Social Security
program. The CBO says Social Security will raise $657 billion more
in payroll taxes over the next five years than it pays out in
retirement and other benefits. In the same time, the rest of the
government will run a $137 billion deficit. The result will be $520
billion in surpluses through 2003.

a 0-0 tie in the Cotton Bowl, Enis skillfully won a coin toss with
Air Force captain Brock Strom, settling the issue after four
decades and a slight change of venue.
</P>
<P>
   A howl of protest immediately filled Los Vaqueros restaurant on
North Main Street, as the Falcons _ correctly _ suspected foul
play. The original coin _ with a Falcon on one side and a Frog on
the other _ had disappeared into Enis' pocket. The replacement had
a Frog on each side.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief negotiation, the two sides agreed to hold another
reunion in a few years and make it best-of-three.
</P>
<P>
   It was a festive moment, celebrating TCU's last Cotton Bowl team
and the first bowl adventure ever for the 4-year-old service
academy.
</P>
<P>
   Playing with its first-ever graduating class, Air Force amazed
the nation by sailing through a 9-0-1 season highlighted by a 13-13
tie with Iowa, the eventual Rose Bowl champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an incredible season,'' recalled Strom, who played
guard and linebacker at 217 pounds in the one-platoon era and
became the academy's first All-American. ``Nothing like that had
ever happened before, and it never will again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iowa game, early in the year, gave us a tremendous lift,
and it was just a totally amazing thing for me. I grew up in
Michigan, and I never envisioned us even playing a Big Ten team,
much less doing so well.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for the Cotton Bowl, we weren't disappointed at the tie. We
were just thrilled to be playing the Southwest Conference champion
in such a big event. Back then, there were only four New Year's Day
bowls, and it was a tremendous thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Strom spent 27 years in the Air Force and helped develop an
anti-satellite system that his son, Brock, used as a pilot in the
Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Enis, a former star at Polytechnic High School, quarterbacked a
TCU team that finished 8-2 and featured tackles Bob Lilly and Don
Floyd and fullback Jack Spikes, all of whom gained All-America
recognition during their TCU careers.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Cotton Bowl, both teams were thwarted by a field
frozen hard from a recent snow. Recalling that he slipped and fell
on the turf with a receiver open in the end zone, Enis was proud to
redeem himself with the winning coin toss.
</P>
<P>
   ``As usual, I relied on the advice of my friend, Sherrill
Headrick,'' Enis said, ``who has always been able to calm my nerves
in pressure situations. When we were at TCU, he would always come
by before the game and say something encouraging, like, `Well,
we'll probably win this one, if you don't mess it up too much.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Headrick, the former North Side High School star who spent
several All-Pro season with the Kansas City Chiefs, returned the
compliment, saying, ``Enis saved my (NFL) career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once when we were rookies, he kept badgering the coach to put
me into the game because the other team was running this draw up
and down the field, and Enis told him I could stop it. I'm sitting
there listening to this, and finally the coach says, `Shut up,
Hunter. We're gonna cut Headrick after this game.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But they finally put me in and I won the job and they cut the
other guy. So I'm always willing to help him out.''

HICKS' MONEY BEEFS UP STARS' DEPTH AND PUNCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Mike Heika 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If only Tom Hicks' money could buy good health. Then maybe the
Stars might get a guarantee on that Stanley Cup they so dearly
covet.
</P>
<P>
   But with humans being the fragile creatures they are and San
Jose Sharks defenseman Bryan Marchment still roaming the NHL, the
Stars have to prepare to enter the 1998-99 campaign with their
biggest problem from last season _ injuries _ still an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing you can do to prevent them, injuries are going
to happen,'' said Stars defenseman Richard Matvichuk, who is
rehabilitating a left knee that underwent major surgery in June.
``Maybe the only thing you can do is be prepared for them when they
eventually happen.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's where Hicks' money comes in. While the Stars can't
completely avoid injuries this season, they certainly have tried to
be more prepared to deal with them. First, they bought additional
lineup depth on the free-agent market. Second, they toughened the
lineup in anticipation of a season in which they will move into the
raucous Pacific Division, where they will meet injury-producing
players like Marchment as many as six times this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you watch a player over a five-year period, then I believe
you can get a picture of their injury situation,'' Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock said. ``Mike Modano is almost certainly going to miss
10-15 games every season because of injuries. Joe Nieuwendyk likely
will miss some time because of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the organization has done then is looked at how we can be
better prepared to address that.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason the Stars acquired tough guy Brent Severyn
during the summer. By adding his $425,000 to the payroll, the Stars
are buying an insurance policy of sorts against players like
Marchment. Last season alone, Marchment's questionable hits caused
knee injuries to Modano and Nieuwendyk, former Stars player Greg
Adams (now with the Phoenix Coyotes) and Carolina Hurricanes winger
Kevin Dineen. Marchment served two suspensions for a total of 11
games because of the hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be in perfect shape and never know when something like
that's going to happen,'' said Nieuwendyk, who missed all but one
period of the playoffs and has not participated in preseason games
due to off-season surgery on both knees. ``That's the hardest
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Stars had 318 ``man games'' lost to injury last
season, trainer Dave Surprenant said the ``health'' of the team was
surprisingly good.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have overuse injuries that you can control to some degree,
and we didn't have a lot of those,'' he said. ``The injuries we saw
were ligament injuries that were explosion injuries or violent
injuries. And those basically come down to bad luck.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars had plenty of that, losing impact players such as
Modano (30 games), Nieuwendyk (25 games), Jere Lehtinen (15 games),
Adams (38 games), Shawn Chambers (28 games) and Bob Bassen (24
games) to violent injuries. To combat that ``bad luck,'' they
purchased a good luck charm in Severyn. His job will be to make any
opposing player pay for creating dangerous play around one of the
Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not protection, I certainly don't need protection,'' said
Brett Hull. ``It's more, put that seed of doubt in their head, make
them think twice about coming after you in the corner; that if they
run you, they'll have to pay for it. If we didn't have that
element, people would be running us all game.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Severyn might be the Stars' health insurance, Hull
provides further peace of mind]. If it was proven last season that
the team's offensive output suffers when either Modano or
Nieuwendyk is out of the lineup, and if it's also a fact that both
have a history of missing some games, then why not add depth in the
position of ``offensive superstar''?
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get in a situation where we lose a player like Joe
again, we should be better equipped,'' veteran Guy Carbonneau said.
``But that's the key to any good team in the NHL, you need depth in
every area. Last year when we had key people hurt, we could still
beat 17, 18, 19 of the teams in the league. But when it came down
to beating Detroit without our best lineup, then it became a lot
tougher. That's hopefully where we're better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars are so stacked with depth this season that they should
have two power-play units that could be considered No. 1 on most
teams. They should also have the deepest group of defensemen in the
NHL, as well as two goalies (Ed Belfour and Roman Turek) who could
take the No. 1 spot on many rosters. It's clear they are taking few
chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are who you are, and we are a team with some players who
have a history of injury,'' Hitchcock said. ``But by getting those
players in top shape, teaching them different ways of not making
themselves vulnerable and giving them plenty of rest during the
season, we think we can improve our odds.''
</P>
<P>
   They certainly can't be any worse than last season.

UCLA DEFENSIVE LINE IS A WORK IN PROGRESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The characters have changed, but the challenge
remains the same for UCLA assistant coach Terry Tumey: turning a
makeshift defensive line into a cohesive, effective unit.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Tumey worked wonders with Jeff Ruckman, a converted
fullback, Weldon Forde, a converted linebacker, and Damon Smith, a
transfer who did not receive a Division I-A scholarship offer out
of high school. From first game to last, no unit improved more than
Tumey's line.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Tumey has more talent at his disposal. But it's young
talent. And it's injured talent.
</P>
<P>
   Junior Pete Holland couldn't have played against Miami (sprained
ankle). Sophomore Kenyon Coleman is out at least another week
(sprained knee) and may not be ready for the Oct. 10 showdown at
Arizona. True freshman nose guard Ken Kocher missed several weeks
of training camp (sprained ankle), then aggravated the injury
Friday. Another true freshman, Anthony Fletcher, was ready to
redshirt until Coleman went down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The injuries have taken a toll, but they haven't decimated
us,'' Tumey said. ``Fletcher is a nice surprise. Physically, he's
gifted enough to play as a freshman. He's been an added bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   To compensate for the injuries, for the inexperience and for the
sweltering weather, Tumey used a nine-man rotation against Texas
and Houston and will continue to do so.
</P>
<P>
   That means freshman Steve Sua, sophomores Micah Webb and Kory
Lombard, junior Travor Turner and seniors Jayson Brown and Vae Tata
_ the supporting cast _ must become regular contributors, at least
until their injured linemates return.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that's helped us is we've played so many guys,''
Tumey said.
</P>
<P>
   Fullback glut: All those years without an effective fullback,
and now the Bruins have two, Durell Price and Craig Walendy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a tough one,'' offensive coordinator Al Borges said.
``We've got to get Walendy more involved, but Durell is playing
really well. We've got to find a way to use both their talents.''
</P>
<P>
   Ditto, tight ends: The Bruins are even deeper at tight end, with
four capable players and a fifth, Gabe Crecion, sitting out the
season as a redshirt.
</P>
<P>
   Seniors Mike Grieb and Ryan Neufeld have monopolized the playing
time, leaving little opportunity for transfer Randy Hakes and
redshirt freshman Bryan Fletcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, we have two good frontline players and we've got
to give them time,'' Borges said.
</P>
<P>
   Weather update: Hurricane Georges did not slam Miami as school
officials had feared when they canceled the game. But 200,000
people were without power Friday, and schools and businesses were
closed, as was Miami International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did the right thing,'' UCLA coach Bob Toledo said. ``I'm
totally convinced.''

HARRY CARAY HELPS BASEBALL TO A HEAVENLY YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- We've heard the stories of lifeless flowers
blooming anew in a family garden the spring after a loved one's
death. Now comes even more persuasive proof that there is an
afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   The rejuvenation of baseball in 1998 can't be explained any
other way than to say Harry Caray, God rest his irascible soul,
made it to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   For 16 years he was the Chicago Cubs' MVP, never mind that he
held a microphone and not a bat. He could belt out words as
impressively as Cubs outfielder Sammy Sosa -- or as Caray would
say, Thammy Thotha -- has belted out baseballs this year.
</P>
<P>
   Caray loved baseball, beer and (pardon the expression) broads.
</P>
<P>
   He observed games for a living but was a passionate participant
in life. So it figures that after succumbing to a heart attack,
he'd try to find some way to let the few detractors he left behind
know he had landed on his feet, up in the clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Holy cow, you'd have to be wearing glasses thicker than Caray's
black-rimmed numbers not to see the clues he has been scattering
about the country during the past six months.
</P>
<P>
   From the New York Yankees' season-long tear to the historic
home-run duel being waged by Sosa and St. Louis slugger Mark
McGwire to Cal Ripken Jr.'s astonishing decision to take a seat, it
has been a baseball season tailor-made for the fans that Caray
called the unsung heroes of the game.
</P>
<P>
   His love for the game is being perpetuated by die-hard
enthusiasts and dilettantes alike. After whiffing badly in 1994
when a strike led to the cancellation of the World Series, baseball
is soaring to heights heretofore reserved for one of McGwire's
blasts.
</P>
<P>
   Sports Illustrated, long a barometer of which way the sporting
winds are blowing, has devoted nine of its 21 covers since the
start of May to baseball -- three of four this month. In the same
five-month span last year, the weekly magazine slapped baseball on
its cover four times and not at all in September, when the regular
season is winding down and interest figures to be peaking.
</P>
<P>
   A phone survey conducted by CBS and The New York Times found
baseball is more popular than at any time since the news
organizations started polling people on the subject in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-three percent said they were at least somewhat interested
in baseball, up from 42 percent a year ago. Twenty-two percent of
the 960 adults surveyed described themselves as very interested in
following Major League Baseball, up from 14 percent five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the thinning of pitching talent due to expansion and
the squeeze plays so many franchises are trying in an effort to get
ever more luxurious and lucrative digs, more people than ever
(roughly 71 million) will have attended a game by today's
regular-season end.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not counting the crazies who have stood outside
Chicago's Wrigley Field, hoping to catch a piece of history
launched by Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   Lest anybody doubt that Caray is orchestrating this season the
way he used to the seventh-inning stretch, the proof is in Sosa's
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Before this year, Sosa never had hit more than 40 home runs in
any season. He went into the final weekend with 66, five more than
Roger Maris' previous single-season record. That tied him with
McGwire, who averaged 55 homers in 1996 and 1997, and who plays for
the Cubs' fiercest rival -- and Caray's first major-league
employer.
</P>
<P>
   Caray announced St. Louis Cardinals games from 1945 to 1969. We
imagine he's pleased as spiked punch to see Sosa and McGwire going
down to the wire, (ITAL)mano a mano(END ITAL) for bragging rights
to a chunk of 37-year-old history.
</P>
<P>
   We can picture him yelling himself hoarse in heaven: ``There it
goes . . . it might be outta here . . . it could be . . . It is! A
home run! Holy cow!''
</P>
<P>
   Boy, oh boy, as Caray would say. In this season to savor, there
has been something for every sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   The game's purists could revel in Yankees pitcher David Wells'
perfect game against the Minnesota Twins in May at the House That
Ruth Built.
</P>
<P>
   There also was Cubs rookie pitcher Kerry Wood fanning his age
against one of the more explosive lineups, striking out 20 Houston
Astros. (Can there be any doubt Caray was behind all of Kerry's
K's, as well as his 13-6 campaign?)
</P>
<P>
   The 13th perfect game in history. Thirteen wins for a rookie.
That Caray -- it's good to see his puckish sense of humor survived
his flight to the afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   For the game's historians, Caray delivered San Francisco's Barry
Bonds, who distinguished himself as the first player to record 400
home runs and 400 steals; Houston's Craig Biggio, who became only
the second player to steal 50 bases and hit 50 doubles in the same
year; Texas' Juan Gonzalez, who had driven in 101 runs by the
All-Star break; and Seattle's Ken Griffey Jr., who has joined Babe
Ruth and Lou Gehrig as the only players in history to drive in at
least 140 runs in three consecutive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Ripken, baseball's iron man, who started his
consecutive-game playing streak the same year Caray started with
the Cubs and ended it the same year Caray bowed out, at an amazing
2,632 games.
</P>
<P>
   And leave it to Caray -- that kidder! -- to take a poke at the
buttoned-down baseball traditionalists. They saw their pastoral
illusions shattered in May when the Dodgers traded franchise player
Mike Piazza to the Florida Marlins, marking the start of a
season-long flea market with (blue and) white elephants galore.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' lineup and their front office have been nearly
gutted since Toronto's Roger Clemens lost his last game, on May 29.
Clemens should win his fifth Cy Young award this year, and it'll be
one long, fiendish winter -- Caray will personally see to that --
if Sosa doesn't win his first National League MVP award.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa is smart; he knows there's a wizard working behind the
scenes to make this baseball season so wondrous. That's why he
salutes Caray after every home run he hits.
</P>
<P>
   Having surpassed Maris' record and swept two countries -- his
native Dominican Republic and the United States -- off their feet,
Sosa was asked what's next on his goal sheet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go to heaven,'' he said merrily.
</P>
<P>
   Why, of course. How else is he gonna high-five Harry?

AFFIRMED SUCCESS EASILY WINS VOSBURGH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JENNY KELLNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ In five starts this year, Affirmed Success had
done everything his trainer, Richard Schosberg, had asked of him _
except beat Kelly Kip.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday at Belmont Park, the 4-year-old son of Affirmed did
just that, soundly defeating six acclaimed sprinters, including
Kelly Kip, to win the $250,000 Vosburgh by 1 1/2 lengths over
Stormin Fever.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Schosberg wants Affirmed Success to do what no Vosburgh
winner has ever done _ win the Breeders' Cup Sprint. Seven Vosburgh
winners have been favored in the 14 editions of the Sprint, but not
one has won.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jinx or no jinx, if I can keep him this way for six weeks,
they're going to have a tough tiger on their hands,'' Schosberg
said of Affirmed Success. ``You could not ask for a better bunch of
horses in America than in today's race.''
</P>
<P>
   And Affirmed Success, who had won his last two starts by a
combined 15 lengths, handled them convincingly. Pressuring Kelly
Kip for the first half-mile, Affirmed Success took over on the turn
and pulled clear by daylight heading into the stretch to win in
1:45 4/5 for the seven furlongs.
</P>
<P>
   With Kelly Kip, who had won three straight, fading to fifth in
the stretch, the 10-1 shot Stormin Fever closed well from the back
of the pack to gain second. He also finished second in his last
race, to Skip Away in the Iselin.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people thought he would regress after his last race,
but I thought he would run his race,'' said Mark Hennig, trainer of
Stormin Fever.
</P>
<P>
   Another five lengths back was Tale of the Cat, followed by
Banker's Gold, Kelly Kip, Distorted Humor and Rare Rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two times he ran with Kelly Kip he was green,'' said
Jorge Chavez, who was aboard Affirmed Success when he finished
second to Kelly Kip in the Finger Lakes Breeders' Cup and the
DeFrancis Dash at Laurel. ``Today it was a different story. From
the beginning I had complete confidence in my horse.''
</P>
<P>
   In extending his record to four victories in six starts and
earning $150,000 for his owner, Albert Fried Jr., Affirmed Success
returned $5.50 for a $2 bet to win as the 8-5 favorite. He won the
Forego in the slop at Saratoga in his last start, and the Vosburgh
was his third straight victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good thing is there are six weeks between now and the
Breeders' Cup,'' Schosberg said. ``I plan to breeze him at
Churchill Downs twice. He's run over every track and I feel good
about the six furlongs.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this race, you have to put him at the top when talking
about sprinters.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FINISH LINES
</P>
<P>
   Subordination led all the way to win the $200,000 Belmont
Breeders' Cup by 2 1/4 lengths over the favored Yagli, covering the
nine furlongs in 1:45 4/5, one-fifth off his own track record on
the inner turf. Subordination, ridden by David Flores, returned
$8.60 for a $2 bet to win as he won his fourth race in seven starts
this year. His trainer, Gary Sciacca, said the 4-year-old colt
could start in the Breeders' Cup Mile on Nov. 7 ... The trainer
Sonny Hine said the Woodward winner, Skip Away, will most likely
breeze Tuesday as he prepares for the $1 million Jockey Club Gold
Cup on Oct. 10 ... The Groom Is Red, owned in part by Boston
Celtics Coach Rick Pitino and trained by Nick Zito, may make his
next start in the $400,000 Champagne the same day. Also being
pointed toward the race are the Hopeful winner, Lucky Roberto; the
Futurity winner, Lemon Drop Kid, and Prime Directive, who won the
Saratoga Special.

<P>
   Bud Selig is on the line from Milwaukee, and the commissioner of
major league baseball is exuberant about his sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``A generation from now, people are going to look back at this
season and say it was the greatest in the history of baseball,'' he

<P>
   ``It's just unbelievable what's been happening this season. It's

   ``Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa have been my luck. And it's not
only what they've accomplished with their bats. It's the way in
which they've handled it. They've done it with such incredible
grace and dignity. I can't tell you how wonderful this has been for
me personally and for the game I oversee.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a mere four years ago that Bud Selig was overseeing the
game during one of its darkest moment when a bitter strike shut it
down in August and eventually caused Selig to cancel the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you can say I'm now batting 1 for 2 during my
tenure,'' says Selig. ``We've gone from having one of our worst
periods to perhaps our best. We still don't have any margin for
error. It's taken us a long time to get the fans back to the ball
parks, and we have to just keep the momentum going.
</P>
<P>
   ``Proof of just how popular baseball has become again is the
fact we've set all-time attendance records in both the majors with
more than 70 million and the minors with more than 34 million. The
average attendance in the majors this season has been 29,000. In
the so-called good, old days of the 1950s, it was only 13,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Since he succeeded the ousted Fay Vincent on an interim basis in
1992, Bud Selig has been relentlessly battered by the reactionary
factions of the sporting press who angrily disapproved of his
creating new divisions, two wild cards and interleague play.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out Bud Selig has been vindicated on all counts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interleague play has turned out to be a huge success,'' says
Selig. ``The fans in the cities love it. And having a wild card
keeps teams who would otherwise be playing out the string in the
playoff race. Just look what's happening this month in Chicago, New
York and San Francisco. The people in those towns are all excited
about their teams going into this last weekend because their teams
have a chance at the wild card. The wild card has done what I
thought it would do create excitement and interest among the
fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, even during a dream season, there has been
controversy for Bud Selig, who came under media criticism recently
for his not being in Chicago when Sammy Sosa also surpassed Roger
Maris' single season home run.
</P>
<P>
   Nine days earlier, Selig, Maris' family and others were a high
profile presence in St. Louis when McGwire became the first person
in major league history to hit 62 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I've debated my decision not to be in Chicago when
Sammy also went ahead of Roger Maris,'' says Selig. ``Of course, I
wish now I had been there. I'd never want Sammy Sosa to be slighted
in any way. He's just a wonderful, wonderful person.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we had that ceremony for him last Sunday in Chicago, we
were sitting alone on the Cub bench when he turned to me and said,
`I'm just so grateful. You've all been so great to me.' And then he
hugged me. Like I said, Sammy's a wonderful, wonderful person.''
</P>
<P>
   Selig has owned the Milwaukee Brewers since their inception in
1969, but he has put his ownership in trust and his daughter is now
in charge of the team.
</P>
<P>
   But Selig still occasionally attends Brewer home games, and was
present on Wednesday when Sammy Sosa dispatched his two home runs
against his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 30 years of watching the Brewers play, I've never once
rooted for a visiting player,'' he says. ``But I have to admit I
was rooting for Sammy Sosa the other day. I felt like crying when
he hit those two home runs out. It was just such an emotional
scene. You just had to be there to enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   There are watershed moments and defining figures in athletics in
the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   They say Babe Ruth's charismatic personality and booming home
runs were responsible for reviving baseball after it tumbled into
the dark abyss after the Black Sox Scandal.
</P>
<P>
   They say Jackie Robinson's presence in the Brooklyn Dodger
starting lineup dramatically changed the sociological landscape of
baseball, if not an entire country.
</P>
<P>
   They say that the 1958 NFL championship game overtime between
the New York Giants and Baltimore Colts proved to be the lightning
rod for the incredible growth of the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   They say Magic Johnson and Larry Bird were responsible in the
1980s for resurrecting the NBA that had deteriorated into a
moribund state.
</P>
<P>
   And now Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire have come along a couple of
years before the millennium to vault baseball to heights of
popularity unmatched in its sacred history.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole McGwire-Sosa drama has been turned into a wonderful
celebration of baseball throughout the country,'' says Selig.
``I've never seen anything like it in my lifetime. Everyone's now
talking baseball. Just look how the press has reacted to it. The
New York Times and so many other papers have been putting the story
on page one of the news sections. As a commissioner I couldn't have
asked for more. As a baseball fan, it's been delightful and
enjoyable. I wish it could go on forever. ...''

ANIMATED FILMS TO FLOOD THEATERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ Bang!! Pow-pow-pow!! Blam!! Crash!!
Ka-ta-Boom!!
</P>
<P>
   That's not the sound of the next Batman movie, but rather the
coming collision of cartoon characters at the nation's theaters as
an unprecedented wave of animated movies washes over the world's
multiplexes in the next 15 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's ever been a time in movie history when
there will be more animated product in theaters,'' said Stewart
Halpern, an entertainment analyst with New York-based ING Barings
Furman Selz.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen animated movies will be released by the end of
next year, an animation explosion fueled by studios' desire to cut
into the massive profits from Walt Disney Co.'s cornerstone
business and by the soaring popularity of TV cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   Friday is zero hour in the challenge to Disney's stranglehold.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks SKG, whose animated operations are headed by former
Disney movie chief Jeffrey Katzenberg, opens ``Antz'' in 2,400
theaters _ seven weeks ahead of Disney's ``A Bug's Life.'' Both are
computer-generated comedies targeting the same kind of broad-based
appeal last achieved by ``Toy Story,'' which generated a stunning
$192 million in domestic grosses three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That's not all. ``A Bug's Life'' opens opposite Paramount's
movie version of its long-running TV series ``Rugrats'' on Nov. 20;
four weeks later, DreamWorks comes back with its animated Biblical
epic ``Prince of Egypt.''
</P>
<P>
   Is there enough room for that much animation? The answer is a
tentative yes. Early indications are that all four flicks will
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The upcoming animated movies all look very exciting and
there's no reason they can't all be hits,'' said producer Bill
Gerber, former co-head of production at Warner Bros. ``There's
definitely a shortage of things that parents can take their kids
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source tracking service,
believes ``Antz,'' produced by Pacific Data Images, represents a
major milestone. ``The technology used in animation has just gone
through the roof,'' he said. ``We didn't think another company
could top for at least 10 years what Pixar did in `Toy Story.' It's
incredibly fascinating because there's something happening at every
moment and the characters feel like real characters.''
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum forecasts ``Antz'' should gross $75 million, which
will make it the top non-Disney animated film ever, replacing
``Beavis and Butt-head.'' He believes ``Rugrats'' is on track for
$50 million, while ``A Bug's Life'' and ``Prince of Egypt'' should
top $100 million with the former likely to go as high as $125
million.
</P>
<P>
   Should that scenario play out, DreamWorks will become a
full-fledged Hollywood player with a serious track record in
animation and live action (``Saving Private Ryan''). What's
impressive is that the upstart will have achieved what longtime
players Warner Bros. and 20th Century Fox could not _ becoming a
viable challenger to Disney's cornerstone franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``DreamWorks has a real challenge with `Prince of Egypt' to get
the message out as the story of the Ten Commandments,'' Bucksbaum
said. ``What parent would not want their kid to see a wholesome
version of the Bible? It has incredible special effects, so they
can bring in the young date crowds but it's tough to present all
that in a one-minute trailer.''
</P>
<P>
   If the three 1998 challengers succeed, they will have managed a
towering achievement _ justifying the hundreds of millions of
dollars spent by the rest of Hollywood to steal Disney's thunder.
And that will encourage the rivals to do even more.
</P>
<P>
   Next year will be even more intense with a trio of highly
recognizable Disney movies _ ``Toy Story II,'' ``Tarzan'' and
``Fantasia 2000'' _ due out along with Japanese hit ``Princess
Mononoke,'' being released by its Miramax arm. They will face at
least five high-profile challengers: DreamWorks' 16th century
comedy ``El Dorado,'' Paramount's ``Beavis &AMP; Butt-head II'' and
``South Park,'' and Warner's sci-fi adventure ``Iron Giant.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox will release ``Planet Ice'' in 2000, while DreamWorks is
planning on ``Chicken Run'' and ``Shrek'' for the millennium. The
4-year-old studio, which promised at its founding that animation
would be a key contributor to its operations, is working on seven
projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have one or two per year every year,'' said Jim Tharp,
DreamWorks distribution chief. ``We really believe a good story can
be told in any medium. We have an aggressive program already and
we'll stay the course.''
</P>
<P>
   Why is taking on Disney so important?
</P>
<P>
   Other studios have watched jealously for most of the decade as
Burbank-based Walt Disney Co. churned out massive profits from
``Beauty and the Beast,'' ``Aladdin,'' ``The Lion King'' and ``Toy
Story.'' Wall Street analysts believe that for every dollar in
domestic ticket sales, Disney takes in $3 or $4 in profits due to
the enormous markets for stuffed toys and home videos.
</P>
<P>
   That means ``The Lion King'' made Disney about $1 billion in
pure profit. Even the relatively modest performances of its past
three animated films _ ``The Hunchback of Notre Dame,''
``Hercules'' and ``Mulan'' took in a combined $320 million
domestically _ probably translate to another $1 billion in profit.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman Michael Eisner put it bluntly last week, saying, ``
`The Lion King' created an enormous amount of competition because
others wanted a piece of that pie.'' And to give the best possible
spin on ``Tarzan,'' he said the optimists in the company believe it
has ``Lion King'' potential.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney has raised the bar on expectations because they are so
expert in marketing and distribution in reaching audiences other
than children,'' notes Paul Dergarabedian, president of industry
tracker Exhibitor Relations. ``That's why the other studios are
targeting older audiences to make animation a cool thing, although
it's a double-edged sword because you can wind up alienating both
groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Dergarabedian believes it's highly probable that the
proliferation of TV cartoons, brought on by cable TV's ferocious
appetite for programming aimed at children, will lead to more and
more animated features.
</P>
<P>
   ``If kids like something, they never tire of it,'' he said. ``If
they like a Disney video or a Barney video, they'll watch it over
and over, although it still has to be cool and that's the challenge
for the studio to figure out what's in and what's out. Kids are
very fickle and they'll dump something they don't like fast, so
it's a tough racket knowing how to read kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros. knows this. The studio managed a respectable
performance in late 1996 from ``Space Jam'' but hopes to take on
Disney suffered a major setback earlier this year when ``Quest for
Camelot,'' generally viewed as a ``classic'' Disney-style cartoon,
bombed. The studio spent $75 million on its first entry in feature
animation; domestic grosses hit $22 million.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus was that Warner Bros. had fallen behind the times
with the core audience of children under 10 becoming less
interested in fairy-tale type stories and more interested in
entertainment aimed at teen-agers, such as the smash hit ``Men In
Black.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Animated films take three years, sometimes longer, to develop
and trends change in that time,'' Bucksbaum said. ``You used to
have to target children under 7 but now that crowd is staying home
watching cartoons. You can't throw a typical cartoon up there any
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the potential pitfalls, Halpern believes the economics
of animation are compelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other studios are looking to get in because you don't have to
deal with escalating salaries for top-level talent and you don't
have to give up points (percentages of revenues) on ancillary
streams,'' Halpern said. ``The real factor, though, is the
recognition that the family market is relatively under-served and
that's what really drives home videos.''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Disney has taken its marketing of animation up to
still another level by releasing relatively low-cost sequels to
hits like ``Aladdin'' and ``The Lion King'' exclusively for the
video market, Halpern noted. ``Once you get the property out in
theaters, you can you make direct-to-video sequels at a very low
risk,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Is Hollywood in danger of killing the animated golden goose
through making too many films? No one seems to be worried. For
example, Halpern believes ``A Bug's Life,'' which portrays ants,
grasshoppers and fleas, will do $150 million and not suffer
significantly from the presence of ``Antz'' any more than
``Armageddon'' _ the year's top grosser at $196 million _ was held
back by the earlier release of ``Deep Impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Halpern also noted that retailers are optimistic over
merchandise related to ``A Bug's Life'' and ``Rugrats.'' ``The fact
that retailers are saying they expect sales to be strong is as good
a sign of encouragement as you can get,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The analyst, who rates Disney and Pixar as buys, contends that
Hollywood's seeming boom in animation is simply an adjustment of
that genre to the fact that the market for movies continues to
expand impressively. U.S. box office grew 7 percent last year and
will rise by a projected 12 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until now, the number of animated films has stayed pretty
much the same with a market share that's quite small,'' Halpern
said. ``There's plenty of room for more.''

 &HT;    Officials hope big fall events offset summer woes
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ After Labor Day and the end of the summer
busy season, Laura Pittman is accustomed to business slowing down
at the gift shop where she works.
</P>
<P>
   But this year the slowdown is troubling, because it comes after
a summer in which Florida's wildfire crisis devastated the normally
busy June-July period. Even after the fires were put out, many
visitors stayed away, thinking the area was in charred ruins,
business owners say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night I worked from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. and didn't have a
single customer come in the door after 6 p.m.,'' Pittman said on a
recent weekday. ``It's really hurt business a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourism officials hope to recoup some of the losses with several
big events this fall, but business owners fear it will be too
little, too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``October will be better than normal, but it can't replace
July,'' said Patrick Welsh, owner of the 10-room Beach House Motel,
which suffered a 50 percent loss during July. ``If you lose the
summer, it's really hard to recover.''
</P>
<P>
   While Daytona's biggest events come during the winter and spring
_ the Daytona 500 stock car race and Bike Week in February,
followed by Spring Break in March _ businesses rely on a steady
stream of summer visitors to round out their annual revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The summer of 1998 began normally, with large crowds for the
Memorial Day weekend. By early June, though, wildfires had begun
popping up across the state as an unprecedented drought and searing
heat baked Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Western Volusia County is covered with large stands of pine
trees, most grown for timber and paper companies. Fires sparked by
lightning erupted there, sending firefighters scrambling to contain
the flames.
</P>
<P>
   In late June, the situation took a dire turn, as fires marched
steadily eastward toward heavily populated suburbs. Gov. Lawton
Chiles called in federal help, and thousands of firefighters from
across the country rushed to Florida to fight the blazes.
</P>
<P>
   But things got even worse as the July Fourth weekend approached.
With fires surrounding several metro areas, Chiles and federal
officials took the unprecedented step of closing a 125-mile stretch
of I-95 between Jacksonville and Cocoa. They also ordered the
evacuation of an entire county, Flagler, just north of Daytona
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The impact on business was devastating.
</P>
<P>
   ``July Fourth is normally our busiest week and we only had 12
guests in 50 units,'' said Barbara Beaudoin, a desk clerk at the
Dolphin Beach Club, a condominium complex. ``People couldn't even
get here because the highways were closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Cancellations mean loss
</P>
<P>
   Worse, officials had to cancel the Pepsi 400 stock car race,
which is normally the biggest tourist draw of the summer. The race
routinely attracts 150,000 visitors, most of whom book hotel rooms
for at least three nights and spend freely on meals and souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our normal rates are $60 to $80, but during race week we get
$100 a night with a four-night minimum,'' said Janine Dabkowski, a
clerk at the 45-room Seascape Motel. ``Everybody here took a big
loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourism officials say sales tax receipts dropped 34 percent in
June and July over 1997 tallies.
</P>
<P>
   The fires were under control by late July, and while about 500
homes statewide were destroyed, the flames never reached the
tourist strip along the beach.
</P>
<P>
   But business owners say faraway visitors didn't seem to grasp
that fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had people calling from as far away as Germany and Canada
asking if we were on fire,'' said Welsh of the Beach House Motel.
``They were watching television and thought all of Florida was on
fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Graziano, owner of Gator's Pizza, said it was his worst
summer in 15 years. He blames the media for hyping the story while
the fires roared, then never reporting the aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never reported that on the beach side we didn't have any
damage,'' Graziano said. ``Some people think we're still damaged.
I've had a lot of customers saying they were surprised that the
beach side was so clean. People don't know it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps hardest hit of all were several fireworks stores. State
officials banned all fireworks for July Fourth because of the
danger, and the stores simply closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost our biggest month of sales,'' said Pat Moran, manager
of Phantom Fireworks. ``We do more than 50 percent of our business
for the year during the week before the Fourth. It's really put a
scar on our business.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials encouraged residents to shoot off their fireworks over
the Labor Day weekend, but Moran said his sales were nothing
compared to a normal July Fourth. Tourism officials are hoping to
replace some of the lost revenue with the rescheduled Pepsi 400
stock car race, which will take place Oct. 17. They also have
extended a fall motorcycle event called Biketoberfest from three
days to 10 days, hoping to draw more tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Business owners hope the events will help, but many have doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have their kids in school in October,'' Graziano said.
``They can't take a whole week off then. It won't be like July.''

WITHOUT A HOMER, SOSA SCORES WINNING CUB RUN  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL DEDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ With the regular season reduced to two games, Sammy
Sosa and the Chicago Cubs won the first one with one arm tied
behind their backs: Kerry Wood's.
</P>
<P>
   The sore-elbowed rookie phenomenon sat on the bench, filing his
nails, during Saturday afternoon's game against the mighty Astros,
20 of whom he struck out in a single game back in May. As the game
moved into the late innings, with the Cubs behind 1-0, Chicago had
to struggle to keep its playoff hopes alive.
</P>
<P>
   Wood filed harder as Sosa struck out in the sixth inning,
leaving the Cubs a run behind the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Wood started to chew on his nails in the seventh, when the Cubs
tied the game on a double by Gary Gaetti, a wild pitch and a
sacrifice fly by Orlando Merced. Neither player was a Cub until the
past month.
</P>
<P>
   Wood stopped chewing in the eighth, when the Cubs took the lead
after Sosa hit a mere single. Sosa finished the day as he began it,
with 66 home runs, and fell two behind Mark McGwire, who hit Nos.
67 and 68, but that single to left field started a rally that kept
the Cubs even with the surging Giants and ahead of the tumbling
Mets with only Sunday's games remaining.
</P>
<P>
   His base hit was followed by a single to right by the veteran
Mark Grace and another double by Gaetti. Sosa may be the most
valuable player of the league, but Gaetti is the most valuable
player of the Cubs for September. After being dropped by the
Cardinals, he signed with the Cubs on his 40th birthday and has hit
.322 since.
</P>
<P>
   Then Wood nearly chewed up to his sore elbow in the ninth, when
the Astros pulled to 3-2 on a home run by Jeff Bagwell, then put
the tying run on third base with a Moises Alou double and a
groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later the 51,950 fans thought the game was tied when
reliever Rod Beck fielded a nubber up the first-base line by David
Clark, swiped a tag at the runner and threw the ball into Clark's
back. It appeared to be the beginning of another Cubs loss for the
ages. But Umpire Eric Gregg said Beck tagged the runner, and the
game was over. The Cubs slapped backs in celebration as the Houston
crowd groaned.
</P>
<P>
   The day began with a three-way tie in the National League
wild-card race. It ended with the Giants and Cubs a game ahead of
the Mets. The Mets lost in Atlanta, 4-0, and the Giants won in
Denver, 8-4. If two or more teams end up in a tie, it would result
in playoff games beginning on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Wood will sit out the Sunday afternoon game as well. He has
thrown without pain in practice, but the Cubs say they will not
risk a 20-year-old's career, even for a chance at their first World
Series since 1945.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want him to hurt himself,'' Cubs Manager Jim
Riggleman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs were saved Saturday not only by Gaetti but by pitcher
Mark Clark. With a $5 million salary, Clark is paid more than any
other Cub but Sosa, who is making $8 million this year. Clark has
been the least consistent member of the Cubs' starting rotation,
with a 4-6 record since the All-Star Game break.
</P>
<P>
   Clark was nearly removed after only five batters, when Houston
took a 1-0 lead and loaded the bases. But he got out of the jam and
allowed only five hits in eight innings. He was matched by Shane
Reynolds, who failed to win his 20th game, leaving with the game
tied 1-1 in the eighth. Clark is now 9-14. Jay Powell (7-7) was the
loser.
</P>
<P>
   Beck escaped with his 50th save.
</P>
<P>
   A questionable left arm starts for the Cubs on Sunday: Terry
Mulholland. Mulholland, the nonstarting starter, is scheduled to
face Mike Hampton. The Cubs paid the veteran Mulholland $600,000
for the year, plus healthy contract incentives for successful
starts, then kept him out of the rotation. Mulholland gave the Cubs
two terrific starts recently in Wood's place, made all the more
remarkable because Mulholland's father is very ill. The 35-year-old
won games on the road this month in San Diego and Milwaukee, giving
up a combined three earned runs.
</P>
<P>
   Scoreboard watching was the national pastime in the Cubs dugout.
As leadoff hitter Lance Johnson was digging into the batter's box
to start the game, the scoreboard showed the Mets losing, 4-0,
while San Francisco put up four runs to take a 4-1 lead against the
Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   The starting pitcher for the Cubs in a playoff would be Steve
Trachsel, who is 14-8 but has been pummeled in three starts since
he gave up Mark McGwire's record-breaking 62nd home run in St.
Louis on Sept. 8.

HISTORY RIDES WITH CLASSIC CAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSSIER CITY, La. _ Fifteen years ago, trainer David Cross
accompanied Sunny's Halo to Louisiana Downs for the most impressive
performance in Super Derby history.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Classic Cat could become his most profitable winner.
</P>
<P>
   If the opportunistic 3-year-old colt can give Cross a second
Super Derby score, he will receive the first-place share of the
$500,000 purse, plus a $1 million DeBartolo Challenge Bonus for
also winning the July 19 Ohio Derby and Aug. 30 Remington Park
Derby. That $1.3 million check would be the largest non-Breeders'
Cup payday in the country this year, and would lift Classic Cat's
1998 earnings over $2 million, tops among 3-year-olds and higher
than any horse except Silver Charm and Skip Away.
</P>
<P>
   Classic Cat is the 8-5 program favorite in the
mile-and-a-quarter Super Derby, and will be ridden by Shane
Sellers, who dominated the NTRA All-Star Jockey Championship in
June at Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie.
</P>
<P>
   Fate seems to be on their side. The Super Derby ranks have been
decimated the past month by the defection of Coronado's Quest,
Victory Gallop's brief but untimely illness, and a knee injury this
week to Raffie's Majesty.
</P>
<P>
   But although the leftover eight-horse field contains just two
other stakes winners (A Fleets Dancer and Code Six), Classic Cat
does not lack for competition.
</P>
<P>
   Arch, co-owned by Claiborne Farm and trained by all-time
Louisiana Downs stakes champion Frank Brothers, is lightly raced
but brimming with potential. Dogwood Stable's Early Warning came to
hand in August at Saratoga for hot trainer Todd Pletcher. And
locally based Code Six should not be dismissed, based on home-track
advantage and his comparable speed figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The others will make him work for it,'' Cross said. ``But I'm
going in there thinking I've got the best horse. If they get beat,
they get beat, and I'll be the first to congratulate the winner.
That's the only way you can look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   The only other time Cross ran a horse in the Super Derby, he
brought the race its first Kentucky Derby winner. Sunny's Halo
romped to a 10-length victory in 1983 in the fourth running of
Louisiana Downs' most important race.
</P>
<P>
   Owned by Gary Garber of Tarzana, Calif., Classic Cat earned his
stripes with a victory in the Lexington Stakes in April and a
subsequent third in the Preakness Stakes. In the Preakness, he
finished only three-quarters of a length behind Victory Gallop.
</P>
<P>
   Another trainer going for a Super Derby double is Phil Gleaves,
who saddles John Franks' Sophisticated Man today and won in 1986
with Wise Times. Dogwood Stable also won the Super Derby in 1992
with long shot Wallenda.
</P>
<P>
   Two horses have Texas ownership: Sir Tiff races for Jim McGuire
of Dallas and John Pierce of Navasota, and Houston Slue is owned by
Royce Roberts of Longview. Houston Slue's trainer, Tony Richey,
operates a ranch in Tyler.

SOMETIMES FLY-FISHING CAN BE THE BEST WAY TO LAND LARGEMOUTH BASS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By BOB HOOD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many view fly-fishing as an escape from the norm, a more polite
way to catch bass than on a bait-casting rod of brute strength and
with a lure full of hefty treble hooks.
</P>
<P>
   Philip French of Cresson simply looks at fly-fishing as another
fun way to outsmart Mr. Largemouth, a fish revered by Southern
freshwater fly anglers.
</P>
<P>
   ``On some days, you will catch a lot more bass on a fly rod than
you will on other tackle,'' French said, ``but there are other days
that when you do draw a strike, you certainly appreciate it.''
</P>
<P>
   On a cloudy, cool morning one day last week, French shoved his
23-year-old Skeeter boat into a Parker County lake and slipped
together a two-piece, seven-weight fly rod. At the end of his
monofilament tippet, he had tied a deer hair bug, a chunky,
brilliant yellow and black lure with a pair of big plastic eyes.
</P>
<P>
   French has caught as many or perhaps more largemouth bass on
conventional bait-casting tackle than most anglers, but he
occasionally likes to bring out his fly rod, whether it be for
striped bass at the tailrace of a large reservoir, trout in a
Montana stream, tarpon and bonefish in the Florida Keys, or
largemouth bass in a freshwater lake.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, fly-fishing is an art, but it certainly is not a sport
limited only to the artful. Novice anglers, between wrapping the
line around their hats or in the trees behind them, can experience
the same thrills of a fish exploding on a tiny fly or popper at the
surface as can the veteran fly fisherman.
</P>
<P>
   The main difference between fly-fishing and using a conventional
baitcaster is that the rod used by the fly fisherman casts the line
while a baitcasting rod is used to cast the lure.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the fly angler's equipment allows him to cast a much
smaller lure, one weighing no more than a tiny feather, as far as
most baitcasters can cast a one-ounce lure.
</P>
<P>
   Matching the hatch, a term used by trout anglers when trying to
choose a fly that best resembles a particular species of insects
rising to the surface to hatch, doesn't carry a tune with
largemouth bass fly anglers. But that doesn't mean it isn't
important to know what the bass are feeding on.
</P>
<P>
   French chose the deer hair bug because he figured the fish would
be feeding in shallow water. He handed me an almost identical lure,
along with several others to switch to if the bugs failed to draw
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   As we cast the lures toward the outside edge of a heavy bed of
moss that lined the entire lake, an occasional bass could be seen
breaking the surface in a furious attempt to catch a minnow. It was
the kind of surface action that causes the fly fisherman to keep as
close an eye on the waters around him as he does on the spot where
his fly has just landed.
</P>
<P>
   French let his deer hair bug rest silently on the calm waters at
the edge of the moss for a few seconds before making the lure dart
by stripping the line between his fingers. The sight of the tiny
morsel resting at the surface must have been more than a 2-pound
bass could stand, for the fish engulfed the lure seconds later and
tried to head beneath the moss.
</P>
<P>
   French landed the fish, one of more than 20 that would be taken
in just a few hours of fishing. But, to catch many of the others,
it would take a bit of strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The early morning top-water strikes didn't come as often as
French had hoped, so he switched to a Woolybooger, a sinking lure
that, when wet, looks something like a dragonfly.
</P>
<P>
   Dragonflies, as most anglers know, are a favorite food source
among bass living in small lakes and ponds.
</P>
<P>
   Although French was using a floating line, the monofilament
leader allowed the lure to sink several feet in a relatively short
period of time. In turn, that allowed French to work the lure deep
around a row of stumps near the moss where less active bass might
be hiding.
</P>
<P>
   The tactic soon paid off when another 2-pounder grabbed the fly
as it passed by the shaded area at the base of the stumps.
</P>
<P>
   Later, a third fly _ a Rubberlegs _ was put into action. A
sinking lure like the Woolybooger, the slender Rubberlegs fooled
several bass into striking as it passed along the outside edge of
the moss.
</P>
<P>
   Although the fly rod is a limber tool, setting the hook on the
sinking lures is relatively easy due to the sharpness of the small
hooks and the aggressiveness with which the bass strike.
</P>
<P>
   Anglers who have never fly-fished but who want to get started
can do it two ways, French said. They can take the expensive route
or the inexpensive route.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can buy fly reels and rods that cost several hundred
dollars each, but you also can buy a pretty nice outfit for around
$75 to $95,'' French said.
</P>
<P>
   Fly rods and line are classified by their ``weights,'' which
indicate their strength and size.
</P>
<P>
   ``For largemouth bass, any seven- to nine-weight rod will work
OK,'' French said. ``Just make sure that if you buy a seven-weight
rod, you use seven-weight line. You must match the line with the
rod for it to work right for you.''
</P>
<P>
   How much a person spends on a rod also is a personal choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, you don't need an expensive reel for largemouth bass,
because all the reel is used for is to store the line. But, if you
are fishing for big fish like tarpon, you will want a really good
reel with a good drag system.''

IT'S COBI VS. STERN JOHN IN FINALES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The Los Angeles Galaxy concludes its Major
League Soccer campaign this evening against the Chicago Fire, but
the real battle is between Cobi Jones and Stern John.
</P>
<P>
   Half of it will play out at the Rose Bowl, where Jones needs
four points two goals, four assists or a goal and two assists to
pull even with John in the MLS scoring race, more if John tallies
in Columbus' clash at D.C. United this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Jones enters today with 49 points (18 goals, 13 assists) in 23
games for the Galaxy (23-8, 65 points) he missed eight games while
off on World Cup duty having dominated opposing defenses sinnce the
season kicked off more than six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   John, a 21-year-old Trinidadian, has emerged in his first MLS
season as the league's best striker, totaling 53 points (23 goals,
4 assists); he's been America's hottest player the past two months,
with 14 goals and three assists in his past 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, who wins doesn't really matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the last couple years,'' says Jones, the top MVP
candidate. ``Roy Lassiter and Preki won (the scoring title) the
first two years, but the thing that everyone remembers most is that
D.C. United won the championship both years. ... That's the most
important thing, winning the championship.''
</P>
<P>
   That's been in the Galaxy's sights all season. They won't gain
any ground toward it with a victory today over the Fire (20-11,
53), their expected foe in the Western Conference finals, but would
love to see a good result against a team they've struggled against,
especially after being shut out by San Jose in their last two
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we want to make a statement to ourselves,'' said
Galaxy captain Robin Fraser. ``We need to know that we can outplay
(Chicago) and beat them. ... It would be nice to establish some
sort of dominance.''
</P>
<P>
   That, to the Galaxy, takes precedence over the Jones-John duel,
but they'll be watching what happens in Washington. John has been
the league's hottest player the past two months, scoring nearly at
will; he has 14 goals and three assists in his past 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   Jones has only two goals and two assists since his hat trick
(plus two assists) Aug. 22 at New England, and his teammates say
they'll do what they can to help him in his quest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's on my mind,'' says Fraser. ``I'd love to see Cobi win, or
Welton (third with 45 points) or Cien (Mauricio Cienfuegos, seventh
with 42).''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm out there trying to get goals, and he's out there trying
to get goals,'' Jones says. ``Both of us are trying to better our
teams. We'll see what happens. If he wins it, more power to him. If
I win it, more power to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I'll be happier if it's me.''
</P>
<P>
   GALAXY NOTES: The Galaxy has set MLS records this season for
goals (84) and points (65), and they share the record for wins (23)
with D.C. United. ... Rookie midfielder Clint Mathis is serving a
suspension after receiving a red card in last week's loss to San
Jose. ... Goalkeeper Jorge Campos will make his first appearance
against L.A. since the Galaxy traded him and Chris Armas to the
Fire last spring. ... Second-place Chicago, which has won three in
a row, will face Colorado in the first round of the Western
Conference playoffs. The opener is Thursday at Soldier Field. ...
Rookie-of-the-year candidate Josh Wolff, a former college teammate
of Mathis' at South Carolina, has six goals and three assists in
eight games since the Fire fell to the Galaxy in Chicago on Aug. 8.
Galaxy castoff Ante Razov has five goals and two assists in that
span. ... Razov, a former UCLA star from Long Beach, leads the Fire
with 29 points (10 goals, 9 assists).

McGWIRE TO LEAVE STRESS IN ST. LOUIS FOR OFF-SEASON 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ A season of glory, history and mental stress comes
to an end today for Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the St. Louis Cardinals play their final game against
the Montreal Expos, McGwire is packing his bags and heading home to
California. The Great Home-Run Chase will be over.
</P>
<P>
   He's planning to play golf, spend some time with his son Matt
and vegetate on the couch. He doesn't plan to use his brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you get a break from using your brain, I'm going to
take it,'' McGwire said. ``It will be a big relief to get back to a
normal life and to have a vacation. This is by far the most
grueling season I've ever had. Knock on wood, my body has held up,
but it's been grueling mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire enters today's last game against Montreal with 68 home
runs after hitting two yesterday. Sosa has 66 home runs, and today
will determine who walks away with baseball's most prestigious
single-season record.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire seems glad just to be walking away, although he does
admit being envious of Sosa's situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to be in his shoes going into the last (weekend)
trying to make the playoffs,'' McGwire said. ``What a great
position.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals aren't in that position. Their chances of making
the playoffs crumbled long ago, leaving McGwire an entire winter to
reflect on his individual accomplishments and decompress from the
overwhelming attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has more mental strength than any player I've ever been
associated with,'' Cardinals infielder Pat Kelly said. ``It's
absolutely incredible what he's gone through and still stayed
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire insisted his satisfaction won't center around winning or
losing the home-run title but what he and Sosa have done for
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I've realized,'' McGwire said. ``And it's hit me
over the past few weeks from the letters and gifts I've received
from people, is the impact Sammy and I have had on the game and on
people's lives. That hits home more than any numbers. For people to
tell me that, it's amazing. No matter how the season ends, I'm
(darn) proud of what I've done.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers reinforce the impact baseball officials say the
Great Home-Run Chase has had on the sport, doing much to heal the
damage inflicted during the 1994-95 players strike.
</P>
<P>
   A record 70.5 million people are expected to attend
major-leagues games this season, and a CBS/''New York Times'' poll
taken last week showed 63 percent of the respondents said they were
at least somewhat interested in baseball, up 19 percent from last
year. The poll showed 22 percent were very interested, up 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire and Sosa could ride the popularity to a financial
bonanza after the season. Advertising and marketing experts said
the two sluggers could command between $3.5 million-$6 million in
endorsement opportunities. Both made less than $250,000 from
endorsements last year, while Cal Ripken, because of his
consecutive games played streak, made an estimated $9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood director Penny Marshall, who worked on ``A League of
Their Own'', said last week she might be interested in making a
movie about the Great Home-Run Chase.
</P>
<P>
   But McGwire, who could only be played by Arnold Schwarzenegger,
said, ``The whole country already saw the movie. How much more can
you do?''
</P>
<P>
   That might be the question people ask McGwire next year. He is
looking forward to getting his life back to normal, but it may
never be the same as long as he wears the uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Media coverage began as far as back as last September, when he
finished the 1997 season with 58 home runs. Coverage picked up in
spring training, increased when he hit four home runs in the
Cardinals' first four games and never abated as the season
progressed.
</P>
<P>
   He won't be ignored in spring training next year. Roger Maris
discovered that in 1962, the year after he hit 61 home runs, when
people immediately started asking him if he would hit 62. Those who
were there at the time said Maris had a much tougher time with the
press in 1962 than he did during the record-breaking year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll just deal with it then,'' McGwire said.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, he's one game away from a state of vegetation.

NOLAN RYAN ROOTING FOR HIS FORMER `HOME' TEAMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The only man who has stared down Roger Maris, Mark
McGwire and Sammy Sosa from the rather intimate distance of
60-feet, 6-inches is watching the home-run chase with the same
intense interest as the rest of the nation, but he's also keeping a
close eye on his two favorite teams.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan Ryan, favorite son of not one but two Texas metropolitan
areas, hopes to be at The Ballpark in Arlington to watch the
Rangers in the first round of the playoffs this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot easier for me to watch games there than at the
Astrodome,'' said Ryan from his home in Alvin just outside Houston.
``I hope both the Rangers and Astros do well in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``An all-Texas World Series, now that would be something,
wouldn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   It's not all that far-fetched either, Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Rangers keep playing like they have been of late, I
think they have a legitimate shot of going deep into the
playoffs,'' he said. ``The Astros are more of a balanced club and
if Billy Wagner does the job as a stopper, they can go a good ways,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have no reason to concede anything to the Yankees,
Red Sox or Indians in the postseason, according to Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is a strong, strong club but if a team catches them
right and is playing well, they can be beat,'' Ryan said. ``If the
Rangers' pitching performs like it did this last week, they've got
a shot at beating them. The Rangers can put up the same kind of
offensive numbers the Yankees can, maybe better.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan faced Maris at the end of his career, in 1968 and 1969, and
McGwire and Sosa at the beginning of theirs. Here's his scouting
report on the three most prolific single-season home run hitters in
baseball history:
</P>
<P>
   On Maris: ``He was more of a line drive type hitter. He didn't
hit these mammoth blasts like these guys have been hitting. He
liked the ball down and in, what I'd call a typical left-handed
hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure didn't view him as an out. I certainly respected his
ability and thought that in that (Cardinals') lineup (in the late
'60s), he was definitely still a threat. I didn't look at him as
much as a home run hitter in those days because his home run
numbers had dropped but he was still a legitimate hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   On McGwire: ``I considered him and Bo Jackson a lot alike in
that they both liked the ball below their waist. You almost
couldn't throw it too low for them. They'd hit the ball down even
out of the strike zone. I always tried to pitch him up and in hard
and if I threw him a curveball I'd keep it low and away and out of
the strike zone, so he'd have to reach for it. He was such an
aggressive hitter you were hoping you could get him to chase a bad
breaking ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see a lot of guys pitching him right on his hands
today and I don't know if they're afraid to because they know if
they make a mistake it'll cost them dearly or what. A lot of guys
are pitching him out and over the plate and he's hitting a lot of
balls to center field.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sosa: ``Sosa was just a youngster then and a free-swinger. In
those days he wasn't really a disciplined hitter. He'd get himself
in trouble swinging at bad pitches. I'd change speeds on him and
try not to make a mistake, because if you left the ball in the
strike zone, he'd take a pretty good hack at it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEMSON, S.C. _ With a 29-19 loss to Wake Forest Saturday,
Clemson flashed back to 1985. That was the last time the Tigers
committed seven turnovers (against Kentucky) and the last season
Clemson opened with a 1-3 record.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the '85 Tigers also earned an Independence Bowl bid,
but this team may not be so fortunate. The next three games are
against North Carolina, Maryland and Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost three in a row; it's eating at my gut and the
team's guts and everybody else's,'' said Clemson's fifth-year coach
Tommy West, who has three years left on his contract.
</P>
<P>
   The last Clemson coach to lose to Wake Forest, Ken Hatfield in
1993, was fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I'm not as worried about history as I am our team,''
said West, who is 0-2 in the ACC.
</P>
<P>
   This was an important ACC road victory for Wake Forest (2-1, 1-0
ACC for the first time under coach Jim Caldwell). The Deacons have
won only twice in Death Valley since 1961 and are trying to live up
to their No. 22 preseason ranking by Sports Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   Clemson's seven turnovers _ three fumbles and three
interceptions in the second half _ silenced the crowd of 60,000 in
Death Valley, and negated the fact that Clemson had more total
offense than Wake Forest (405 yards to 373) and that the 350 yards
passing were the second-highest total in Tigers history (behind 364
in 1963). Injuries in the backfield forced Clemson to the air.
</P>
<P>
   Each team had its share of big plays. Wake's Brian Kuklick had
touchdown throws of 48 and 56 yards, which were his only two
completions of the second half in nine attempts. Clemson's Brandon
Streeter had a 58-yard TD in the fourth quarter and a 63-yard pass
that set up a 4-yard score in the first.
</P>
<P>
   But Streeter, who had 319 yards passing, the second-highest
total in school history, was intercepted four times and fumbled a
snap at the Wake 12 with 3:53 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turnovers are killing us,'' said Streeter, who was lifted for
backup Woodrow Dantzler. ``It doesn't matter how many yards you
throw for if you can't put it in the end zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Wake Forest, which had 16 days off since its last game, had the
fumble-fingers in the first half, losing three, including one on
the Clemson 3. The odd 12-7 halftime score was a result of the
first safety against Clemson in 14 years, a product of holding in
the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we had to win it down the stretch with our defense,''
said Caldwell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were going to win the game in the fourth quarter,
and we have third-and-1 and fumble the snap,'' West said.
</P>
<P>
   Wake Forest had possession most of the first half, Clemson the
second.
</P>
<P>
   Kuklick, playing without a leg brace for the first time this
season, was ``turned loose,'' Caldwell said. The quarterback broke
his leg against Clemson last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main goal is to finish in the top third of the ACC, so
we've got to beat Clemson,'' Kuklick said. ``This is a big
victory.''
</P>
<P>
   And a big loss for West, who's refused to speculate on his
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ain't ever quit anything, and I'm not going to quit on our
football team,'' West said. ``I didn't hire me and I'm not the one
who's going to get rid of me, so you're asking the wrong person.''

 &HT;    Recruits gain admission despite low SAT scores
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- As director of admissions at Georgia Tech, Deborah
Smith knows that George O'Leary's football recruits get special
consideration when their applications reach her office. But even
she admits surprise at the difference between their entrance-exam
scores and those of the overall student body.
</P>
<P>
   Tech football players, in the four years of freshman classes
beginning with the fall of 1993, averaged 897 on the Scholastic
Assessment Test, according to an NCAA study of major colleges
during that period. The SAT is the most widely recognized
college-entrance exam.
</P>
<P>
   With an average SAT score of 1,305 during the same period for
all Tech students, the gap is 408 points _ third-largest among
Division I-A schools, behind Wake Forest and California-Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   While Tech is in impressive overall academic company with those
schools, the football team's SAT ranking in the Atlantic Coast
Conference is unflattering. The Yellow Jackets are ahead of only
perennial national power Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize we were that low,'' Smith said. ``That is
interesting. ... I guess we should be winning more games.''
</P>
<P>
   Such favorable admissions treatment for players is not limited
to the Flats. Every Division I-A football school dips under its
academic norm in admitting players.
</P>
<P>
   Can they succeed?
</P>
<P>
   University of Georgia football players averaged 939 on the SAT,
compared with the average UGA freshman's score of 1,180. The
reality is that coaches retain their jobs by winning games. And
they win by recruiting players who, if not for their skills, would
have the admissions doors closed on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a place for college athletics, but I think we've lost
perspective,'' Smith said. ``There aren't many coaches that get
promotions because they graduate a specific number of players.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Smith said, Tech's position on welcoming
athletes who score well below average is consistent with the
school's philosophy of ``bringing a special talent to campus,''
whether they be football players or international students. She
said several applicants who scored the maximum 1,600 on the SAT
were denied admission recently because their classroom performance
was unimpressive or they weren't considered well-rounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, can this person succeed at Georgia Tech?''
Smith said. ``Coaches are told not to bring kids to us that they
don't think can graduate.''
</P>
<P>
   School officials point out that the limited number of majors
offered at Tech means athletes are compelled to take rigorous
courses because they cannot choose popular career paths such as
physical education, communications and education, available at most
state universities.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure for admission at Tech is similar to that of other
colleges. Transcripts are screened early in the recruiting process
by Smith's office so coaches have an idea on a player's chances of
acceptance. If the coaching staff wants to lobby for a player who
is denied admission, it can present a case before the executive
admissions committee.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said a maximum of 10 cases were heard last year and all
were resolved. No appeal has gone to the ultimate authority _ Tech
president Wayne Clough _ since the system was created in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   At Georgia, appeals can be brought before the faculty admissions
committee, but president Michael Adams gets more involved than his
counterpart at Tech. School officials said Adams often signs for a
Presidential Admit, including 16 of 19 freshmen on the team this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is for the president to make sure all the i's are
dotted and all the t's crossed,'' said Glada Horvat, associate
athletic director for student services.
</P>
<P>
   Academic support system
</P>
<P>
   Like most Division I-A schools, Tech and Georgia accept athletes
who barely meet the NCAA minimum requirements.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary personally screens recruits' transcripts. He is less
concerned with SAT scores than with whether players have taken
legitimate courses and how they've performed in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've found kids that had the lowest minimum test scores for
acceptance but actually made the dean's list a couple of quarters
because they worked at it,'' he said. ``You have others who were in
the 1,200s on the SAT and they end up with academic problems.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary mandates 12 hours a week of study hall for all freshmen
and upperclassmen not in good standing. Tutors are available for
every subject. This summer, reading specialists were brought in.
</P>
<P>
   They meet in the room above his office. ``If I hear a lot of
stomping,'' he said, ``I'm up there in a second.''
</P>
<P>
   In Athens, Georgia has an almost identical support system in
place. When coach Jim Donnan evaluates a recruit, he looks to limit
his risks. It's a bad investment, he said, to take on a player who
will flunk out in two years. But a lot of players would be lost
without a watchful eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you see around the country is most people have an
academic counselor, just like you have an offensive coordinator or
a trainer,'' Donnan said. ``You've got people you delegate to, but
in each phase you've got to stay on top of these areas. We have a
guy that counsels them about student life. He's involved in trying
to get them involved in things off campus, getting them to go speak
to groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot more things now that didn't used to be part of
an athlete's whole deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's academic conditions for athletes have improved
dramatically since the embarrassing Jan Kemp saga in the mid-1980s,
when the former remedial-studies instructor was fired after she
charged that players received preferential treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal moved UGA administrators to stop accepting incoming
freshmen who failed to make the NCAA's minimum academic standards,
although an exception was made recently for a football player.
</P>
<P>
   For SAT scores, the Bulldogs' program ranked fifth in the
Southeastern Conference. That doesn't mean gambles aren't taken on
borderline academic players. Five recruits from Georgia's
nationally ranked class failed to qualify this fall, matching last
year's number.

 &HT;    A double standard
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Any college football coach worth his shoe contract
has carried on about wanting players who can think on their feet.
Does it mean that superior students in helmets and cleats help pad
his victory total?
</P>
<P>
   The evidence says no.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry DiNardo has worked both sides of the field in the 1990s,
first at academically rich Vanderbilt and now at football-crazy
LSU.
</P>
<P>
   According to an NCAA study of college-entrance board scores for
a four-year period beginning with the 1993-94 school year, LSU
players had the lowest average of all Southeastern Conference
schools on the Scholastic Assessment Tests and ranked No. 4 for the
American College Test. For high school grade point average, the
Tigers were ninth. Vanderbilt led in all three categories.
</P>
<P>
   During the same period, LSU went 30-16-1, the fifth-best record
in the SEC. Vandy was worst at 12-32.
</P>
<P>
   DiNardo concludes that a player's test scores and grades mean
little after the opening kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember running a fairly simple offense when I was
coaching the offensive line at Colorado,'' DiNardo said. ``We had
bright engineering students, but they struggled some with what we
were doing because they were more comfortable actually learning out
of a book.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had one guy who was a Rhodes scholar, and he wasn't as
quick a learner as other guys who weren't as good in school.''
</P>
<P>
   The autumn game never will be confused with the College Bowl, an
old TV show matching campus brains. And no recruiting coordinator
ever hit the road in search of a future Jeopardy champion.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-yard dash times and bench-press totals carry more weight
than college-entry test scores and grade-point averages, just as
long as players measure up to minimum NCAA eligibility
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   That conclusion was borne out of a review of admissions
standards at all 112 Division 1-A schools by the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution. Among the findings:
</P>
<P>
   The average scores on the SAT and the ACT, which are the
standard entry exams taken by high schoolers, were lower for
football players than for the overall student body at every school
but Fresno State, San Jose State, Southwestern Louisiana and
Texas-El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Schools with lofty academic reputations drop below those levels
in courting football players. The leader was Wake Forest, where the
average freshman was admitted with a 1,390 SAT score, compared with
923 for football players. The liberal admission policy for
athletes, which took effect during the term of current coach Jim
Caldwell, might explain in part why the Demon Deacons, a longtime
ACC doormat, had improved enough to surface in Sports Illustrated's
preseason top 25 poll.
</P>
<P>
   Of teams in this week's AP Top 25, only third-ranked UCLA
(1,002) had a team average of more than 1,000 on the SAT. Ten
scored under 900 _ with LSU (807) and Tennessee (847) the lowest.
</P>
<P>
   Among Southernschools, Duke and Vanderbilt made the 10
universitieswith the highest combined exam scores, while the South
dominated the bottom 10, with Southern Mississippi and Arkansas
leading the way.
</P>
<P>
   What does it all mean on the football field? Although recruits
with strong academic backgrounds aren't to be ignored, you win with
athletic talent.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan P. Niednagel, a consultant to NFL teams and author of
``Your Key to Sports Success,'' has studied the records of players
coming out of colleges to the pros. ``If you were to put together
an All-Pro team, it would be dominated by types that usually don't
do so well academically,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches and athletics officials whose players score low on
standardized tests, or are substantially lower than the student
body's, routinely claim that the tests are biased against those
from disadvantaged backgrounds, a position supported by many
academicians. They say the scores might not reflect a person's
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tend to think tests are not as reflective of a person's
ability as their high school records,'' said Doug Bland, Wake
Forest's director of academic services, who cites the football
program's respectable 73 percent graduation rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these are minority kids, and you take into account
their backgrounds and where they came from. Many of them have never
been encouraged about their academic life but instead have heard
(about) how fast they run or how well they tackle. You get them in
an academic environment, give them proper help, and you see
wonderful things happen with them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, the worst ACT/SAT scores are in the Southeast,''
Southern Mississippi coach Jeff Bower said. ``So I would assume the
(teams) in the Southeast are probably at the lower end of your
scale.''
</P>
<P>
   They prefer to focus on such traits as character and desire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working an advanced math problem on a test, having very little
experience on the subject, is a lot different than closing an
off-tackle hole on a run play,'' Tennessee coach Phil Fulmer said.
``The (test) is relevant to how you measure intelligence, but
there's a lot of bright young men out there that just haven't had
the opportunity or been disciplined enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia coach Jim Donnan, a former North Carolina State
quarterback, talks of a teammate who excelled on the field but
barely cut it in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day we had a guy who was a 4.0 (GPA) student jump
offsides, and this other guy says, 'What are you doing, stupid?'''
Donnan said. ``This guy was a very poor student and he was calling
this 4.0 guy stupid. This poor student never made many mistakes on
the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, you might think a Phi Beta Kappa guy is never going to
make any mental errors, but the pressure of football and different
things that happen cause you to make mistakes even though you might
be mentally stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   At the most reputable academic schools, however, coaches say
they would rather put their fate in the hands of a smart player. Of
course, those are the student-athletes they have to recruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smart players make fewer mistakes,'' Stanford's Tyrone
Willingham said.
</P>
<P>
   Woody Widenhofer at Vanderbilt says his players are so sharp
that the defense calls audibles _ adjusting formations or strategy
at the line of scrimmage before the ball is snapped more than most
college offenses. ``You can do it here because you have quick
thinkers, very bright kids who can absorb a lot,'' Widenhofer said.
</P>
<P>
   It has not translated into many wins, however. So Widenhofer
widened the school's recruiting base and tweaked the approach,
which might result in more academic risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible that some of my predecessors made a mistake, of
recruiting student-athletes they knew they could get in school and
they were hoping they were athletes,'' Widenhofer said. ``I'm
recruiting athletes who can play in the SEC and hoping we can get
them in school, and then have the academic support system to make
them successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt is not alone among esteemed universities that stray
from the campus philosophy when it comes to admitting football
players.
</P>
<P>
   At California-Berkeley, the average freshman in the NCAA study
was admitted with a 1,305 SAT score, compared with 877 for football
players. Striking differences also were found at Florida (1,245 and
883), Michigan (1,260 and 929) and Notre Dame (1,314 and 925).
</P>
<P>
   DiNardo acknowledges that universities must wrestle with the gap
between student and student-athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ``How low do you want to go?'' DiNardo said. ``When that person
sits in a classroom, how far away (academically) from people on his
right and left is he? That is really the moral decision, because
you could put someone in an impossible or very difficult situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets real complicated for a coach, because we're the ones
that have a personal relationship with the kid. A lot of people
just come to the stadium. They don't really care when the game is
over if the kid ever graduates. The (players) are basically in the
entertainment business. So there are a lot of tough decisions when
you get in those high-academic private schools.''
</P>
<P>
   At many universities, the coaching staff consults with the
admissions office early in the recruiting process to ascertain a
prospect's chances of academic survival. Often, there's an avenue
to appeal a valued player who is denied admission _ all the way up
to the university president.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage of academics and athletics can work, and Stanford
is proof.
</P>
<P>
   The school has produced a steady flow of NFL players, notably
Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks John Elway and Jim Plunkett. Its
players have been tutored by eventual pro coaches Bill Walsh,
Dennis Green and John Ralston. The Cardinal have made 18 bowl
appearances, four in the last 10 years, and own a 50-44-2 record in
the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford wins games while compiling the highest Division 1-A SAT
average among football teams, at 1,108.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most major state universities, which get the bulk of
their players in-state, schools such as Stanford must travel
farther, which requires larger recruiting budgets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have to (recruit) better and harder,'' Willingham said.
``Other conference schools can go (just) to Los Angeles and find
the guys they need. I have to go to Los Angeles and beyond to find
what I need. They're out there _ great athletes who are great
students.''
</P>
<P>
   At Duke, one of Stanford's mirror schools in the Southeast,
coach Fred Goldsmith says that at least 35 percent of college
players would not be admitted there. Duke is the only Atlantic
Coast Conference school that does not accept players who meet just
the NCAA minimum entrance standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all talk about their academics. They're all great
schools, but our test scores reflect the credibility of our
university,'' said Goldsmith, who indicated he was not using the
variation as an excuse for lack of football success.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State, the ACC's football juggernaut with titles in all
six of its years, had the lowest SAT (827) and ACT (71) scores
within the period of the NCAA study.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is about as low as you can get,'' Goldsmith said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what league officials thought about the numbers, Goldsmith
noted that FSU's football exploits carried more weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what the conference wanted,'' he said. ``We got a big
television contract.''

 &HT;    Seminoles dominate No. 18 USC 30-10
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- What Bobby Bowden hoped for Saturday was a
giant leap forward by a Florida State team which still has
aspirations of winning the national championship. What he got in a
30-10 win over No. 18 Southern California was an uncomfortable
reminder: The Seminoles may have all the pieces that make up a
great team, but they have yet to fall into place.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we're gaining some ground but we're still not a team
that really executes well on offense,'' said Bowden, whose No. 10
Seminoles (3-1) should move up in the polls today with a loss by
No. 9 Washington. ''The defense played great. But the offense just
basically played well enough for us to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The final score did not reflect how much Florida State's defense
dominated the game, holding Southern California to only 189 yards
of total offense. Seventy-three of those yards came on one run by
Frank Strong in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   On the day, USC completed only 3 of 19 passes for 23 yards. R.
Jay Soward, one of the nation's very best receivers, was held to
only one catch for five yards. Florida State almost doubled
Southern California's time of possession (39:16-20:44).
</P>
<P>
   ''Our defense really put a hurting on that team,'' said
quarterback Chris Weinke. ''It had to be a long ride home for a lot
of the guys on that offense. Our guys really had an attitude about
them today.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida State led 13-3 at halftime and 20-3 late in the third
quarter. Southern California's lone touchdown was set up by
Strong's long run but the Seminoles were never really challenged.
Still, long after the game, Bowden remained concerned about an
offense that rolled up enough yards (404 total) but could not take
advantage of several scoring opportunities, including two turnovers
by Southern California inside its own 20-yard line in the second
half. The Seminoles got only three points out of those two Trojan
miscues.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know the offense is going to come around with time,'' he
added. ''I just don't like to wait.''
</P>
<P>
   It was another tough afternoon for Weinke, who completed 13 of
31 passes for 228 yards and two touchdowns. Weinke was one of eight
FSU offensive starters who missed two days of practice with an
intestinal virus this week and at times he looked sluggish. On
several occasions he missed wide open receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really didn't start feeling right until Friday,'' said
Weinke, who did not throw an interception for the second
consecutive game. ''If we just execute, we would have really done
some damage on offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Still there were heroes on the offensive side of the ball for
Florida State:
</P>
<P>
   Wide recevier Peter Warrick, who posted his sixth career
100-yard game with 112 yards receiving and a touchdown. He set up
another touchdown with a 41-yard catch and run.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore Jeff Chaney, the No. 3 tailback, who came off the
bench when Travis Minor sprained an ankle and rushed for a
career-high 89 yards and a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   But Bowden is impatient because his team has no margin for error
since the inexplicable 24-7 loss at N.C. State on Sept. 12. The
Seminoles play three of their next four games on the road and still
have No. 11 Virginia and No. 8 Florida coming to Tallahassee in
November.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now we can't worry about it (the national championship)
because the N.C. State loss put us on the back burner,'' said
Bowden. ''We just have to keeping trying to get better.

ANDRADE HAD A SEPTEMBER TO REMEMBER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just a year ago it seemed Billy Andrade was on his way into the
PGA Tour Championship at Champions Golf Club near Houston. The $4
million event was established for the top 30 players on the money
list. Andrade was 30th entering the final week, but Bill Glasson
won in Las Vegas to jump from 54th to 27th and Andrade missed by
$5. Ouch.
</P>
<P>
   The year that followed proved to be a long and difficult one for
Andrade, a native of Bristol, R.I., who now lives outside Atlanta
with wife Jody, son Cameron, and daughter Lelia. The 1998 PGA Tour
Championship seemed out of sight. Just retaining his Tour card
seemed in doubt. Then Andrade finished joint ninth in Milwaukee
(Sept. 6) and pulled out a stunning victory in the Canadian Open
the following week.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly Andrade had his first Tour victory since 1991, when he
became the first player in 12 years to win his first two events in
consecutive weeks (he followed a victory at the Kemper Open with a
win at the Buick Classic). Andrade, 34, is sitting this week out
but has risen to 41st on the money list and thinks maybe it's his
turn to knock somebody out of the Tour Championship, which will be
contested at his home course, East Lake GC in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was absolutely fantastic,'' said Andrade. ``It was a big
win. It was huge. I hadn't won in so long. You never really know
when it's going to end. I was having such a poor year for me. Then
I finished ninth in Milwaukee. I played fantastic in Canada. It's a
big deal to win a tournament of that magnitude. It's a national
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven years between victories was a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see it coming,'' said Andrade. ``I was ninth in
Milwaukee. To make a 35-foot putt and get it up and down out of a
sand trap just to get into a playoff made it even more enjoyable.''
</P>
<P>
   After hitting into the water on the 18th hole of the third
round, Andrade began the final round of the Canadian two shots back
of Bob Friend. When Friend bogeyed the eighth Sunday and Andrade
made a birdie, they were all square.
</P>
<P>
   Andrade eventually birdied the 16th and 17th to seize the lead,
but on the par-5 18th, Friend birdied and Andrade found water
again. Andrade proceeded to roll in a 35-foot putt to save par and
force the playoff.
</P>
<P>
   Andrade remembered the putt Rhode Islander Dana Quigley had to
make to win a Senior Tour event the previous week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought of him making that putt and jumping up and down,''
said Andrade, who stayed out of the water on the 18th in the
playoff and beat Friend with a sand-save par.
</P>
<P>
   Andrade is bypassing this week's Texas Open but will play the
next four weeks before the Tour Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year has been a huge struggle,'' he said. ``I'm not used
to not doing well. There were months of sporadic play. I couldn't
seem to pinpoint one specific thing. I'd miss putts one week, make
putts the next. I'm going to try to be the player I can be the rest
of the year. I want to be the best player on the Tour for the rest
of the year.''

   &UR; Tom Tetrault &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who has been head professional at Fall River CC
for two decades, was named New England PGA section pro of the year
in 1990, and won the section's Horton Smith Award this year, will
receive the Bill Strausbaugh Award at the PGA of America's annual
meeting Nov. 5 in New Orleans. There is no higher award on the
national stage, and Tetrault is just the second out of the NEPGA to
win it. The award recognizes someone who excels in club relations
and ``has caused dramatic improvements in employment conditions in
the local PGA sections or at the national level.'' ``He's helped
more clubs in the past 20 years in terms of getting jobs for
professionals than anyone else,'' said NEPGA executive director  &UR; Ed
Carbone &LR; . Tetrault is also a past president of the NEPGA section
... The Ryder Cup continues to occupy center stage on next year's
New England golf landscape. There have been 41,000 applications for
tickets, and just 10,000 will be available in next month's drawing
...  &UR; John Hickson &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who won the recent New England Open at The
Quechee Club, heads the field for the NEPGA individual match-play
competition Wednesday and Thursday at Prouts Neck in Scarborough,
Maine. NEPGA sectional champion  &UR; Mike Baker  &LR; of Bangor Municipal GC
is also in the field of 16. The Wogan Award, for the section's top
player, may be determined at this championship. Baker is trailing
Hickson, who has 85 Wogan points, by 5. Rhode Island Open champion
 &UR; Kirk Hanefeld  &LR; of Salem CC has 78.5 points, and defender  &UR; Paul
Parajeckas  &LR; of Woburn CC is fourth with 62. They all made the cut
at the Eastern qualifying for the Eastern regional PGA Club
Professionals Championship, and they earn an additional 10 points
if they finish in the top 32 in the competition, which ends this
weekend. ``It's still up for grabs,'' said Carbone. ``It's the
closest and most exciting it's ever been.'' ...  &UR; Jim Holbrook &LR; , the
veteran out of Indian Ridge, hopes to join  &UR; Tim Holland  &LR; (1966-68)
as the second threepeat Massachusetts Senior champion when the
championship is played Monday and Tuesday at Eastward Ho! Holbrook
won the last two years at Tedesco and Springfield CC. He will be
joined in the field by insurance business partner and Boston
College associate head hockey coach  &UR; Jim Logue &LR; . The field also
includes newcomer and veteran campaigner  &UR; Walter
Sharis &LR; , &UR;  &LR; reinstated amateur and former Nashawtuc CC head pro
 &UR; Charley Volpone &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and 1995 State Amateur champion  &UR; Ed Fletcher &LR; 
... These thoughts from  &UR; Dean Burpee  &LR; of Charles River CC, who lost
on the first hole of a playoff with  &UR; Steve Tasho  &LR; of Thorny Lea in
the State Mid-Amateur last Wednesday at Concord CC: ``It's unusual
for me to be playing after Labor Day. It's disappointing to lose in
a playoff, but it's the old cliche. If someone had told me on
Tuesday morning, `You're going to be in a playoff,' I'd have said
it would be great.''

NO REASON TO PANIC OVER 3-1 START 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ With 1 minute 30 seconds left in the game
Saturday, fans behind the Boston College bench at Papa John's
Cardinal Stadium started what has become a familiar seranade for
losing teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overrated, overrated,'' chanted the Louisville fans, pointing
to a scoreboard that told you all you needed to know about the kind
of day it was for BC.
</P>
<P>
   Louisville 52, Boston College 28.
</P>
<P>
   No kidding. No fluke, either. It was as sound a beating as the
Eagles have received since Notre Dame spanked them last season in
South Bend, Ind., 52-20.
</P>
<P>
   Critics and cynics may say that BC, a team with an impressive
road win over Georgia Tech and home victories over Rutgers and
Temple, was exposed in the midsummer heat Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But the bottom line is that four games into the 1998 season, the
Eagles are 3-1, which is exactly where most people thought they
would be.
</P>
<P>
   This ``L'' was as unexpected as the ``W'' was against Georgia
Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, with a monumental defensive collapse and such
sloppiness on offense that coach Tom O'Brien removed starting
quarterback Scott Mutryn and starting center Damien Woody
(following a fumbled snap), the Eagles gave back the one win they
need to get into that murky area known as bowl eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien, who has done a nice job of bringing this program back
to respectability, was disappointed with the loss, but not stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every week is a reality check,'' said the second-year coach.
``If we're healthy and play as well as we are capable of playing,
we have a chance to stay with anybody. But we have to play perfect.
We don't have much margin for error. We have six or seven key guys
and if they go down, we've got problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday two of those players, nose guard Chris Hovan and free
safety Pedro Cirino, went down with injuries. Add to that the three
lost fumbles and an interception and you have a formula for
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   But then again, the way Louisville quarterback Chris Redman was
throwing the ball, BC might have had problems winning even if they
hadn't turned the ball over.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien knows that the journey is going to get tough in 10 days
when unbeaten Virginia Tech comes to the Heights for a Thursday
night ESPN game. He knows it could get tougher nine days after that
when Syracuse comes to Alumni Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows who's good?'' O'Brien said. ``But we're going to
find out in a few weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien says it is time to reevaluate, to regroup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to see if we're doing the right things, doing
things right,'' he said. ``We're going to take a few days off and
then by Thursday we'll start concentrating on Virginia Tech.''
</P>
<P>
   What O'Brien and the 38,231 fans saw Saturday was a BC team that
has lots of holes, not a great deal of depth, and a long way to go
before it's ready to move into a viable role as a Big East
contender.
</P>
<P>
   It was clearly a game the Eagles could have won and maybe should
have won. When they trailed, 31-14, at halftime, looking almost
helpless on defense at times, O'Brien tore into them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I chewed on them pretty good at the half, not as much at the
end of the game,'' said O'Brien. ``They know what they did.''
</P>
<P>
   And what they didn't do.
</P>
<P>
   What is different this morning is the perspective or spin that
Eagle fans can put on their team's season.
</P>
<P>
   At 4-0, the Eagles would have been only two wins from being bowl
eligible, three wins from being a bowl lock. And no team _ with the
possible exception of West Virginia at the end of the season _
remaining on the Eagles' schedule looked unbeatable.
</P>
<P>
   At 4-0, the Eagles had some wiggle room to overcome a bad game
such as Saturday's effort.
</P>
<P>
   At 4-0, the buildup for Virginia Tech would have been enormous.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that has changed. Now every game, with the exception of
Navy, is a possible loss.
</P>
<P>
   At 3-1, BC looks vulnerable and a little beat up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still 3-1,'' said O'Brien with a wry grin as he went
back into the Eagles' locker room for a quick postgame shower and a
trip back to Boston on the team charter.
</P>
<P>
   So they are. And that really is all that everyone expected at
this point.
</P>
<P>
   The question that has yet to be answered _ and would be the same
even if the Eagles had won Saturday _ is whether the Eagles will
look at themselves a week from Thursday night and find themselves a
very respectable 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   Overrated? Hardly. As that football guru from the Jersey
Meadowlands who made a pit stop in Foxborough maintains, ``You are
what you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now BC is 3-1 and that's not bad.

DONATO STRATEGY IS DUBIOUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is hard to know what you would do in someone else's shoes.
Impossible, really. You can speculate, ruminate, criticize, even
scratch or shake your head. But until you're in that spot, who
knows? Bruins forward Ted Donato is doing what he thinks is best by
sitting home on the South Shore, far from training camp, while
awaiting a trade from the only pro team he has ever played for.
</P>
<P>
   Three other players _ Jason Allison, Kyle McLaren, and Anson
Carter _ are also sitting home, but unlike Donato, their reasons
are financial. Donato, whose role diminished significantly as last
season wore on, believes he wouldn't get a legitimate opportunity
to earn back his spot on the club. He doesn't want to be the
Bruins' insurance policy if Allison and Carter are out long-term.
He doesn't want to be relegated to a spare part once they
eventually return.
</P>
<P>
   Donato's stand, while sincere, is beyond puzzling. Coach Pat
Burns and Donato had a meeting at the start of camp. Burns thought
they had cleared the air and that Donato would be there. He wasn't.
Privately, some of Donato's teammates are as baffled as the coach
as to why Do-nato hasn't come in, given it his all, and earned a
job on the roster. If he really shined, they figure, there was no
way a team could not utilize his talent and give him his due ice
time. Donato is one of the more versatile players around. He has
plenty of hockey sense, can play all three forward positions, and
is a joy to have around.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have had no luck in accommodating Donato's trade
request. They don't want to give up a dime for two nickels, and
teams are busy trying to sign their own free agents and assess
their own talent before making any deals. It's easy to understand
the positions of the other three _ it's a matter of money _ but
Donato's stand is more philosophical, more difficult to comprehend.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard-educated Donato is obviously book-smart, and he has
always shown plenty of common sense, too. In this case, though, he
appears wrong. It says here he could end up worse off than he is.
You live long enough, you realize there are no guarantees in life.
Donato could've had his destiny in his own hands had he come into
camp. Now, his destiny is in management's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Good luck, Teddy, because that's not a place I'd want my destiny
to be.
</P>

   Chances are pretty good that players around the league won't be
flooding  &UR; Darius Kasparaitis's  &LR; home with get-well cards. The
hard-nosed (politically correct terminology for ``dirty'')
Pittsburgh defenseman is expected to be sidelined 4-6 months
because of a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee. He
is scheduled to undergo surgery Wednesday, and he could miss the
entire regular season. Kasparaitis, as everyone remembers, is the
player who ended  &UR; Steve Heinze's  &LR; season after 30 games in 1996-97
when he delivered a hit that caused knee and abdominal injuries.
Last Sunday, Kasparaitis was injured when he tangled up with
Detroit's  &UR; Darryl Laplante  &LR; during an exhibition game. ``If you
play with fire, you're going to get burned,'' said Burns. ``If you
play out of control like that, your career won't last long.'' ...
 &UR; Dino Ciccarelli &LR; , &UR;  &LR; 38, will miss the next week because of a
sprained right ankle suffered in practice. But Panthers coach
 &UR; Terry Murray  &LR; is not worried about it. ``There's no need to take a
look at him in training camp anyway,'' said Murray. ``He's been
around 100 years.'' ...  &UR; Colin Campbell &LR; , the former Rangers coach
who is now the NHL dean of supplemental discipline, levied his
first suspension last Wednesday, sitting down Stars captain  &UR; Derian
Hatcher  &LR; for four exhibition games and fining him $1,000 for
punching and cross-checking St. Louis defenseman  &UR; Chris Pronger
 &LR; ... While Hurricane Georges didn't affect the Bruins' exhibition
against the Panthers tonight in Sunrise, Fla., some members of the
Tampa Bay Lightning were on alert. Assistant GM  &UR; Tony
Esposito &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who has a home on St. Petersburg Beach, and forward
 &UR; John Cullen &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who has a home on the water at Snell Isle in St.
Pete, had been planning to evacuate the area. ``I've never been
through something like this, none of us have,'' said Cullen. ``A
lot of us were out of town and had no idea what was going on. I
just talked to my wife who said she lined up a place for us to stay
in Orlando. I was like, `Orlando?' That's when I realized this is
serious stuff.'' Team president  &UR; Billy McGeehee &LR;  reportedly passed
out hurricane survival guides to each player. ``I was driving into
the office and saw a building with plywood covering the windows,''
said coach  &UR; Jacques Demers &LR; . ``They had spray paint over the
plywood that said, `We're still open.' When I saw that, I thought,
`Wow.' Then it hit me and now I feel bad for those people who live
near the water or live in mobile homes. I worry for those people.''
The storm had turned west as of Friday night, sparing Tampa, but
the game against Dallas scheduled for last night was canceled ...
Lightning forward  &UR; Stephane Richer  &LR; has had pain and blurred vision
in his left eye after being struck by a stick during practice last
Wednesday but didn't expect to miss any workouts.

   Center  &UR; Brent Sutter &LR; , younger brother of former Bruins coach
 &UR; Brian Sutter &LR; , &UR;  &LR; has joined the Blackhawks' scouting staff. He
retired in April after a 17-year playing career ... Everybody in
the league has an opinion about coming from the junior ranks as
opposed to coming from college. Here is Burns, a former junior
coach: ``I think (college players) are surprised at the intensity
of the NHL games. The practice-to-game ratio in junior hockey
compared to college hockey is a lot different. Juniors are almost
like the NHL. The travel schedule, everything, is based on an NHL
schedule. The toughness of the games. Juniors are a little bit
wilder than it is in college hockey. I think a lot of them tend to
not be prepared for that.  &UR; Andre Savage  &LR; (of Michigan Tech) got a
good rap in the ear Wednesday (in Pittsburgh) and wondered if a bus
had hit him. Some of them adapt and some don't.'' ... Burns has
some advice for those Bruins who end up in Providence: break your
back in the AHL and you might be back in the NHL. ``If you can do
it in the minors, you can do it up here,'' said Burns. ``If you
can't do it in the minors, you can't do it up here. Kids sometimes
take it as a setback but if you take it as a challenge ...  &UR; Tim
Taylor  &LR; was cut from the Detroit Red Wings and he won a scoring
championship in Adirondack, that's why he's playing in the NHL
 &UR; today &LR; .  &UR; Stephan Lebeau  &LR; was cut from the Montreal Canadiens and
he went down and won a scoring championship. He won a Stanley Cup
with the Montreal Canadiens.  &UR; Mathieu Schneider &LR; , &UR;  &LR; my first year,
he came in and I said, `You have to go to the minors' and he said,
`I'm better than  &UR; Larry Robinson &LR; ,' and I said, `What? You think
you're better than Larry Robinson?' Larry was still playing. We
sent him down but you have to give him credit. He went down for
30-35 games, worked his ass off, and proved he could be dominant
down there and came up and played.'' Schneider, now with Toronto,
is an unsigned free agent seeking $3 million a year ... Interesting
to see the fortune of center  &UR; Steve Rucchin &LR; . Rucchin, who earned a
paltry $350,000 last season with Anaheim, was rewarded with a huge
raise this year. His claim to fame is playing between stars  &UR; Paul
Kariya  &LR; and  &UR; Teemu Selanne &LR; . ``I cut Steve Rucchin in Toronto,''
said Burns. ``He was a walk-on. I thought, `This guy can't play in
the league.' He went to Anaheim. He's playing with Selanne and
Kariya. My dead grandmother could probably get 15 points a year
with those two. You've got to look at it that way, too. I give
Steve credit, he kept on going, kept on fighting, and made himself
a better player.''

   Former Bruins center  &UR; Bob Carpenter  &LR; could see his role change
with the Devils this season, if he remains with the Devils, that
is. Carpenter is an obvious choice to be exposed in the Oct. 5
waiver draft. If he isn't plucked, he isn't sure where he fits in
new coach  &UR; Robbie Ftorek's  &LR; plan. ``I feel I can play or I wouldn't
have done all that work over the summer,'' said the 35-year-old
veteran who was a favorite of former coach  &UR; Jacques Lemaire &LR; . ``I'm
at the stage of my career when I just want to play, whatever that
role is. I'm just going to be positive and happy. You don't come
back for your 18th year if it's not fun. You can only worry about
what you can do. Otherwise, you'll have a lot of stress. I'll keep
going until they tell me not to come here, until they tell me to go
home.'' ... Former Bruin defenseman  &UR; Stephane Quintal &LR; , &UR;  &LR; now with
Montreal, came close to losing the sight in his right eye because
of a bizarre infection caused by a tooth extraction in the summer.
After having the tooth pulled, he developed a sinus infection and
was placed on antibiotics. Earlier this month, Quintal had
gastrointestinal problems and began vomiting. After the root of the
tooth was forced into his sinus cavity, he developed another
infection that was very close to his eye; the infection required
surgery to drain. ``Losing the sight in it could have happened if
we had waited too long,'' said Quintal. ``It could have gone up
that far. I'm lucky. Sometimes, because you're a pro athlete, you
think you're invincible.'' Quintal lost 10 pounds while he was sick
and has just recently begun eating food that first goes through a
blender. It's likely he'll miss the season opener ... As if Little
Rock, Ark., didn't get enough bad ink because of our president,
word comes that the first-ever professional hockey game in the
state was an abject disaster. Nashville and Dallas met at Barton
Coliseum for an exhibition game, but overtime had to be canceled
because of rowdy fans. When warned that the game would be stopped
if debris continued to be thrown on the ice, the spectators threw
more paper airplanes and coins. ``I think that was the right
call,'' said Dallas coach  &UR; Ken Hitchcock &LR; . ``You can't have objects
thrown on the ice. Nothing is more dangerous.'' ... 13 days to
opening night.

PERFECTLY AWFUL DAY FOR BC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ They came here looking to punctuate a perfect
September. But instead of putting an exclamation point on a 4-0
start, Boston College affixed a question mark to its first loss of
the season after Saturday's dreadful 52-28 setback to Louisville
before 38,231 at Papa John's Cardinal Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Off to its best start in six years after three consecutive
victories, BC's first loss _ and worst since a 52-20 shellacking at
Notre Dame last year _ gave rise to numerous questions.
</P>
<P>
   How could a BC offense that was so balanced and so efficient
become so turnover-prone (three fumbles, one interception) and so
discombobulated against a Louisville defense that surrendered 801
yards in its opener against Kentucky? How could a BC defense that
was so steely tough in the first three weeks become so Charmin soft
in Week 4 by allowing 52 points and 507 yards total offense?
</P>
<P>
   And, most pressing of all, just how good are these Eagles?
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't take your first five or whatever possessions we
had and fumble the ball twice like we did,'' said BC coach Tom
O'Brien, citing those factors that led to a ruinous afternoon for
the Eagles (3-1). ``Those are opportunities you can't give a decent
team. Maybe they (Louisville) are better than their (2-2) record,
who knows? I keep telling you guys, who knows who's any good in
September? We're going to start finding out here in the next couple
of weeks who's pretty good, but after our performance, we're not
pretty good right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Louisville quarterback Chris Redman made that abundantly and
painfully clear all afternoon after he dissected BC's secondary by
completing 31 of 47 passes for 362 yards and 5 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just clicking,'' surmised junior free safety Pedro
Cirino, who intercepted Redman in the end zone in the first quarter
before sustaining a deep bruise in the second. ``We didn't cover
anyone and we didn't play well, and they executed to perfection.
When you get those two things combined, it can get ugly on the
scoreboard.''
</P>
<P>
   And it did.
</P>
<P>
   Redman, a 6-foot-3-inch junior from Louisville, broke a
single-game school record with his five TDs. He connected twice
with his former high school teammate, Ibn Green, on Louisville's
first and last TDs of the game: an 8-yarder that made it 7-0 with
9:34 left in the first quarter, and a 27-yard TD that gave
Louisville a whopping 52-21 lead with 7:12 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we finally hit on all cylinders,'' said Redman, who
helped snap Louisville's 10-game losing streak with a 35-9 victory
at Illinois last week. ``We've been close a time or two, but I knew
we had this in us. I think this win means a lot because Illinois
was a little bit suspect team, but we knew that (BC) was a really
good ball club that had some talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior quarterback Scott Mutryn, who attempted as many passes as
Redman completed, went 19 of 31 for 230 yards and 2 TDs. He had a
pair of TDs on a 36-yard strike to Dennis Harding that tied the
game, 7-7, with 6:58 left in the first and a 21-yard TD to Anthony
DiCosmo (9 catches, 102 yards) that helped BC pull within 6, 20-14,
with 3:38 to go before intermission.
</P>
<P>
   But that was as close as the Eagles would get after Louisville
capped a 24-point eruption in the second quarter by scoring 10
points in the final 1:30 to take a commanding 31-14 lead at
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Redman hit Green with a huge 40-yard strike to set up a 4-yard
TD pass to Rico Williams and then connected with Leroy Collins (27
carries, 97 yards, 2 touchdowns) in the left flat on the 2-point
conversion to make it 28-14.
</P>
<P>
   On BC's next possession, Jermaine Walker committed a costly
turnover when he fumbled for the second time in the game, this time
at the BC 29. It set up Jon Hilbert's 22-yard field goal that gave
Louisville a 17-point cushion at the break.
</P>
<P>
   BC squandered a prime opportunity from the Louisville 3 in the
third quarter when, on third and goal, Mutryn bobbled the snap,
rolled to his right, and tried to force a pass into the end zone
intended for tight end Rob Tardio. The ball was twice tipped by
Cardinal defenders and once by Tardio before Braxton Anderson
intercepted it in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Senior running back Mike Cloud, the nation's No. 2 rusher who
was held well below his average (184.0 yards per game) after
rushing 21 times for 124 yards, helped BC atone for the mistake
with a 27-yard TD in the third that made it 31-21. But Redman
turned up the heat, firing three more TDs _ a 19-yard pass to
Arnold Jackson in the third; a 14-yarder to Charles Sheffield with
13:52 left, and the 27-yarder to Green _ to cap the Louisville
scoring.
</P>
<P>
   After watching Mutryn fumble a snap from center Damian Woody at
midfield, O'Brien benched both his starting quarterback and center
and inserted backup Tim Hasselbeck, who responded by firing a
46-yard TD to Walker with 3:38 left.
</P>
<P>
   But it proved too little too late.
</P>
<P>
   Period.

YOUNG BACK DOING WHAT HE DOES BEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Not only is the San Francisco 49ers quarterback named Young,
but he's also acting young.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Young may be 38 years old and one season removed from
several concussions that forced him to seriously consider his
athletic mortality, but none of that has meant a thing to him this
season. Of course, to get to this season he had to first get
through the last one, and to do that Young had to get through a
battery of neurological tests after twice being knocked unconscious
in a matter of days.
</P>
<P>
   After the second concussion, the discussion around Young's
family table was no longer about football futures. It was about
possibly using that law degree he'd earned at Brigham Young while
it still had a future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared I was going to have to quit,'' recalled Young,
``but I came out of my discussions with the neurosurgeons and if
they said, `Steve, you're at risk.' I would have quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I went to the head of neurosurgery at Stanford and he was
a straight shooter. He didn't care about the 49ers. He didn't care
about football. He was a guy who told me he'd wear a helmet driving
a car.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went through my high school records, my records at BYU and
in the NFL and the numbers (of concussions) weren't what you
thought. Plus, I never suffered an actual knockout blow. I was
never knocked out. This was not a fly-by-night deal. I know I'd
like to be a judge some day and I couldn't be up there with
short-term memory loss. The defense would love that. `So, Your
Honor, you said my client should go scot-free, right?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I considered all that before I came back. This is not like in
boxing. There's a huge difference between helmet injuries and
boxing injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Some, however, feared that Young was merely trying to convince
himself that he could continue even though he seemed at risk for
the kind of permanent damage that retired Al Toon, Merrill Hoge,
Stan Humphries, and several other prominent NFL players in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, if you look long enough you can find a doctor to
tell you anything you'd like to hear, and there were whispers that
perhaps this was what Young was up to because despite his obvious
intelligence, love of sport can play tricks on a man.
</P>
<P>
   It has done so to hundreds of boxers and at least as many
football players, so could Young be any different?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to convince myself,'' Young insisted. ``They
convinced me. After all that testing, the experts said it was up to
me. They said if I wanted to quit it was fine but I needn't do it
because of the concussions.''
</P>
<P>
   That was all Young needed to hear. He never wanted to leave the
game in the first place, and when his battle with sudden darkness
syndrome ended last season, he wanted to do nothing more than go
back to work.
</P>
<P>
   He did, but the 49ers remained careful with him all season. They
ran the ball more than ever and it was 13 weeks before head coach
Steve Mariucci even had a quarterback sneak in the game plan for a
quarterback who needs only three more rushing touchdowns to pass
Jack Kemp and become the all-time leader.
</P>
<P>
   Before the new year began, he lobbied Mariucci hard to expand
his role again. He wanted to run free as he always had. He wanted
to throw short, deep, and often. He wanted, in other words, to
return to being Steve Young.
</P>
<P>
   Reluctantly, Mariucci agreed, and the result after two games has
been remarkable even by Young's Hall of Fame standards. Not only
are the 49ers 2-0 going into Sunday's battle of the unbeatens
against division rival Atlanta, but they are leading the NFL in
total offense, passing offense, and rushing offense. Young has
passed for 666 yards and six touchdowns, the best start of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, this comes as no surprise to him, but it does come with
a pure sense of joy, for few players seem to love the mere act of
playing football more than he does.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like quarterbacking,'' Young said. ``There are not many
things I could come up with to test my emotions and my wit more.
It's a lab for life. I suggest it for anybody. It tests yourself in
so many ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really the most intriguing career I think I could
find. Playing quarterback in the NFL is like trying to catch a
tiger. You better be careful or it's going to bite you.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes so many years for you to come close to mastering it
that when you do to some degree you don't want to stop. I can
remember talking to Neil Lomax after he had to retire with those
bad hips. He was so frustrated because that came at a time when
he'd just figured out the game and his body quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to sit some years (behind Joe Montana) when I should
have played. I'd like to have those years back as much as I can.
The truth of it is you get hooked on the adrenaline. There's not
too many things you can do that can start the adrenaline pumping
like playing quarterback in the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially when you can still play quarterback the way Steve
Young is playing it _ like a young Steve.
</P>

   Even though Patriots owner  &UR; Bob Kraft  &LR; is a rising power in NFL
circles, some things still amaze him. A recent example is the
decision of Green Bay general manager  &UR; Ron Wolf  &LR; to include a
clause in head coach  &UR; Mike Holmgren's  &LR; contract that allows him to
join another team at the end of this season in return for a
second-round draft choice. What baffles Kraft is that he squeezed
the New York Jets for first-, second-, third-, and fourth-round
choices to allow  &UR; Bill Parcells  &LR; to leave two years ago. ``That
move doesn't get good value for the stockholders,'' Kraft said.
``It gives away shareholder value cheap and I don't understand the
motive. That's the difference between a principal running a team
and a hired gun. I had a Super Bowl losing coach and we got much
more. They've got a back-to-back Super Bowl coach who won one and
they'll settle for a two? I would say that's not in the best
interest of the Green Bay Packers' shareholders. When you're an
owner-operator you look at these things differently from an
employee managing the asset.'' ... Panic seems to be in the air in
Baltimore, and not because  &UR; Jim Harbaugh  &LR; has been benched in favor
of young  &UR; Eric Zeier  &LR; at quarterback. Lame duck coach  &UR; Ted
Marchibroda  &LR; also benched tailbacks  &UR; Errict Rhett  &LR; and  &UR; Jay Graham
 &LR; in favor of untested  &UR; Priest Holmes &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who has one carry this
season. Rhett rushed for 92 yards on opening day but has been used
sparingly since then, despite averaging 5.7 yards a carry (24 for
136). Graham replaced Rhett in the starting lineup in Week 2 and
last Sunday he rushed for 67 yards on 20 carries, but that was not
enough either as the Ravens' offense continued to sputter. ``This
has been on my mind for a while,'' Marchibroda said when he made
the move. If so, why'd he play Holmes at flanker last Sunday and
throw him the ball only once? ... New Cleveland Browns operative
 &UR; Carmen Policy  &LR; has said Holmgren is at the top of his list of
potential head coaches despite a clause in the team's expansion
franchise agreement that prohibits it from using draft picks to
compensate a team for hiring away a head coach already under
contract. Policy is planning to petition NFL commissioner  &UR; Paul
Tagliabue  &LR; to overturn the clause, arguing that Carolina and
Jacksonville were not under similar restrictions when they entered
the league three years ago and none of the other franchises faces a
similar restriction. It's a good argument, but insiders say it will
fall upon deaf ears unless Policy and new Browns owner  &UR; Al Lerner
 &LR; are ready to make their first official act a lawsuit, and they
still might not prevail. A league source maintained last week that
the majority of owners are vehemently opposed to allowing head
coaches to break contracts and move from team to team at will.
``Policy wants to have as many options as he can and that's
understandable, but the owners don't want coaches running the
league,'' the source said.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Holmes is not the only shift at running back in the NFL Sunday,
but at least the one in St. Louis was forced upon  &UR; Dick Vermeil
 &LR; after  &UR; Greg Hill  &LR; ended a huge day last week (158 yards) by
breaking his leg. He'll be replaced by rookie  &UR; Robert Holcombe &LR; ,
who found that out in an unusual way. During a Wednesday meeting to
go over pass protection, running backs coach  &UR; Wilbert Montgomery
 &LR; told Holcombe, ``By the way, Robert, you're going to get a lot of
reps this week. As a matter of fact, you're going to be starting,
so I need your undivided attention.'' Considering that Holcombe had
yet to dress for a game this season, it didn't take much to get his
attention. Coincidentally, the start comes against his hometown
team, the Cardinals. Holcombe played his final two seasons of prep
football at Mesa High in Phoenix while living with his aunt and
uncle ...  &UR; Jay Posner  &LR; of the San Diego Union Tribune was verbally
assaulted by Chargers rookie quarterback  &UR; Ryan Leaf  &LR; after Posner
had noted in the paper that the quarterback followed a bad day on
Sunday by cursing out a cameraman who was filming locker room
interviews for the team's weekly TV show. Other reporters said the
incident with Posner began with Leaf throwing a football at him
while he talked with Chargers GM  &UR; Bobby Beathard  &LR; but the ball was
intercepted by team official  &UR; Bill Devaney &LR; . &UR;  &LR; Leaf denied that, and
Posner said he didn't know about it because his back was to Leaf.
If it is true, it would be similar to an incident in Leaf's college
days, when he threw a ball at a Spokane writer while he was at
Washington State. Regardless, Leaf later called Posner to his
locker to complain about the story, claiming the cameraman had
pushed him and was verbally abusive. When Leaf was finished, Posner
said, ``Now let me tell you something,'' and Leaf leaped up and
began screaming and cursing in a diatribe caught by a San Diego TV
cameraman. An hour later, Leaf called Posner to apologize but by
Thursday he had announced that he was no longer talking to the
media. Told of this, his media-friendly agent,  &UR; Leigh Steinberg,
 &LR; replied, ``That won't last long.'' Beathard was angry over Leaf's
announcement, saying, ``We were all hoping this was behind us.
Players have a responsibility to the organization to talk to the
media.'' Beathard said Leaf's approach was only going to make life
harder for him. As for the ball-throwing incident, one wiseguy who
was there said, ``It was Leaf's 15th straight incompletion,''
alluding to the quarterback's poor performance last Sunday against
the Chiefs, when he went 1 for 15 with two interceptions and three
fumbles. Leaf ended his one-day media blackout Friday, answering 8
of 11 questions with either a yes or a no.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   A year ago last Sunday, in college games, the trio of Leaf,
 &UR; Peyton Manning &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Charlie Batch  &LR; went a combined 75 of 127
for 975 yards and 10 touchdowns. This year, they went 41 of 99 for
357 yards, no touchdown passes, six interceptions, and four
fumbles. A year ago they all were winners. Last Sunday they all
were losers. Welcome to the NFL, boys ... Several Dallas insiders
insist that the Cowboys had plans to play  &UR; Deion Sanders  &LR; at
quarterback in short-yardage situations last week against the
Giants. Head coach  &UR; Chan Gailey  &LR; isn't talking about it, but in
Pittsburgh, he came up with similar ones for  &UR; Kordell Stewart
 &LR; before Stewart made the conversion from wide receiver to
quarterback. Sanders did take snaps at quarterback at the end of
the week, but it wasn't necessary for him to play QB because he
killed the Giants at defensive back and as a punt returner. But
don't be surprised to see him under center one of these Sundays.
Sanders, by the way, has the highest interception-return average in
NFL history at 27.4 yards per return (37 picks for 1,012 yards) ...
Carolina linebacker  &UR; Kevin Greene  &LR; leads the NFC with five sacks
and has become football's answer to  &UR; George Foreman &LR; . He now has
more sacks after the age of 30 (75.5 of his 138) than any man in
history. Green Bay's  &UR; Reggie White  &LR; has made 71.5 since turning 30,
and  &UR; Chris Doleman  &LR; (70) and Buffalo's  &UR; Bruce Smith  &LR; (63.50) are
also in the competition ... Greene is one of the bright spots for
the Panthers, who have already lost six players for the season with
injuries ... The Patriots'  &UR; Robert Edwards  &LR; became only the eighth
rookie since 1970 to rush for a touchdown in each of his first
three games. Of the other seven, one was not  &UR; Curtis Martin  &LR; ...
49ers owner  &UR; Eddie DeBartolo  &LR; secretly testified in front of a
federal grand jury Thursday in Baton Rouge that is looking into
charges of bribery involving former Louisiana Gov.  &UR; Edwin Edwards &LR; 
and a riverboat gambling license. Word is DeBartolo accepted an
immunity deal in exchange for his testimony. DeBartolo admits to
making a $400,000 cash payment to Edwards, who claims he was
serving as a lobbyist. The day after delivery of the cash,
DeBartolo's organization received the final available riverboat
gambling license from the state. DeBartolo first appeared before
the grand jury in June 1997 but is believed to have taken the Fifth
Amendment then. Sources say the deal he eventually agreed to will
allow him to pay a fine and avoid jail time by portraying himself
as a victim of Edwards. Since the matter began, DeBartolo turned
over day-to-day control of the 49ers to his sister. When Policy
left in a dispute with DeBartolo,  &UR; Larry Thrailkill &LR; , &UR;  &LR; a DeBartolo
associate, was installed as club president. Tagliabue has mediated
an ongoing dispute over control of the team between DeBartolo and
his sister, who has opposed DeBartolo's plans to build a mall
adjacent to a planned $350 million stadium near 3Com Park. The
conflict has escalated in recent months to a battle for control.
``Where it's going, I don't know,'' said NFL senior vice president
for communication and government affairs  &UR; Joe Browne &LR; . &UR;  &LR;  ``Eddie
does not have an active role in running the team right now. Once we
determine what happened in Louisiana, we'll review it. If he wants
to get back in as the operating head, it will depend on the charges
and how he pleads. We don't have a formula for if you plead X we do
Y. We'll have to wait and see.'' ... The Colts' defense is the only
one in the NFL without a sack and may be forced to play Sunday
without starting ends.  &UR; Dan Footman  &LR; has a bad knee and  &UR; Al
Fontenot  &LR; has a calf injury. Converted linebacker  &UR; Bertrand Berry
 &LR; would replace Footman and be faced with trying to solve Pro Bowl
tackle  &UR; Willie Roaf &LR; , &UR;  &LR; while Fontenot's replacement could be  &UR; Van
Tuinei &LR; , who only signed a week ago ... Meanwhile, up in Buffalo,
quarterback  &UR; Rob Johnson  &LR; has to be happy to have Sunday off. The
Bills have allowed 22 sacks and he has suffered two concussions in
three games.

<P>
   And then there was one _ and a postseason. A lengthy postseason,
the Red Sox hope.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's game against the Orioles had all the makings of a
controlled scrimmage. If not exactly a Grapefruit League affair,
call it at least a pre-postseason outing.
</P>
<P>
   A parade of Red Sox pitchers each got their prescribed work,
including Dennis Eckersley, who made a record-setting 1,071st
appearance. Every position player save John Valentin made an
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Red Sox didn't have enough to take care of
Baltimore as their four-game win streak ended with a 5-2 loss.
</P>
<P>
   Not a problem.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if the Red Sox wrapped things up with a week or two
to spare and had to worry about whether to rev up or rest up for
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're peaking and playing well at the right time,'' said Mo
Vaughn, who had a hit in his last at-bat and is at .336 in his race
with the Yankees' Bernie Williams for the batting title. ``It's not
like you've got two weeks to go and you try to turn it off and on.
Three or four days and we're back in the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   First, the Red Sox send Pete Schourek to the mound Sunday to
close out the regular season and prepare for his scheduled start in
Game 4 of the first round Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was Bret Saberhagen's turn, and despite giving up a
couple of home runs in his five innings and losing for only the
second time since Aug. 6 to drop to 15-8, he was pleased with his
outing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was definitely a good tuneup,'' Saberhagen said. ``That's a
quality team over there. It's probably one of the toughest games
I've had this year, knowing you're going out there to try and get
some work in, but the game does not mean a thing except to get the
work in.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen, entering on a pitch count of 60-70, threw 49 strikes
in 74 pitches. He gave up a two-run home run to B.J. Surhoff _
Surhoff's first of two _ in the second inning and then a solo job
to Eric Davis in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``The curve to Davis was not that bad a pitch,'' Saberhagen
said. ``I've been working on two different speed pitches and that
was the slower of the two. It was a first-pitch changeup to Surhoff
and had a little too much of the plate. I'm not concerned with that
at all.''
</P>
<P>
   He was more worried about a pitch that hit Oriole shortstop Mike
Bordick in the head in the second inning. Bordick sprawled face
down near the plate. He suffered a contusion on the left side of
his forehead, was taken for precautionary X-rays, but was back in
the clubhouse and told Saberhagen he was fine by phone before the
game ended.
</P>
<P>
   Quiet through five innings and trailing, 3-0, the Red Sox
finally got something going in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Lewis and Darren Bragg both singled and Vaughn worked a
walk to load the bases with no outs. Nomar Garciaparra then ripped
the first pitch down the third-base line for a double, cutting
Baltimore's lead to 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sox would get no more.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Stanley was hit by a pitch to reload the bases, but Trot
Nixon, batting for Troy O'Leary, flied to short left. And then
Robbie Alomar made a nice diving play to stop a Scott Hatteberg
grounder and start an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you can hit the ball much better than what
Hatteberg did,'' said Sox manager Jimy Williams, who cited a couple
of other Alomar defensive plays.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore got one of those runs back on Alomar's solo homer off
Steve Avery to lead off the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   And the Red Sox threatened again in the bottom of the inning.
Vaughn (1 for 3) singled to lead off the inning and went to second
on a wild pitch. But Lou Merloni and Stanley struck out and the Sox
couldn't take advantage. They went down in order in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Boston actually outhit the Orioles, 7-6, but Baltimore hit four
home runs. Scott Erickson went seven innings and got the win to up
his record to 16-13.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a good fastball for the first five innings,'' Erickson
said. ``Then I ran out of gas. I was tired and got a little wild.''
</P>
<P>
   Derek Lowe, Jim Corsi, Avery, and Eckersley each got an inning
of work. Bragg had two hits.
</P>
<P>
   And now it's down to one game before showtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was kind of like a spring training feeling, getting ready
for the season to get going,'' Saberhagen said. ``I didn't have
that intensity I normally have going out there. It's nothing I'm
concerned with. Going to the postseason, if you can't get up for
that, you can't get up for anything.''

BOUTS OF FATIGUE A CONCERN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MASHANTUCKET PEQUOT RESERVATION _ In the last four rounds of his
unanimous decision over Terry Norris Friday night, Dana Rosenblatt
looked like a dead man walking. An hour later, he looked like a
dead man, period.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt was so dehydrated that he had to be given an IV after
becoming ill in his locker room and was then carried on a stretcher
into a waiting ambulance that took him to Backus Hospital. He was
rehydrated there and had a small cut on his right eyelid stitched,
but it is neither his eye nor a sore knuckle on his left hand that
should be a concern for trainer Joe Lake.
</P>
<P>
   His worry has to be a developing pattern in which the Malden
middleweight starts fast, looks dominant for about eight rounds,
and then begins to fade like a pair of well-worn jeans until he is
only a shadow in the ring in the final rounds.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened in his previous fight, a victory over
Arthur Allen, and against Norris: Rosenblatt dominates for eight
rounds and then has to hold on for dear life. Allen used that
advantage to turn Rosen-blatt's face into swollen pulp in six
minutes after he'd failed to win 60 seconds of the first eight
rounds, and Friday night Rosen-blatt made Norris look old, slow,
and ready for retirement for eight rounds. His advantage, according
to Compubox's punch stats, was decisive at that point and clear to
the eye as well.
</P>
<P>
   Then, inexplicably, he stood up for Round 9 and looked like he'd
just seen Heartbreak Hill for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly unable to move his hands often enough to sting Norris
with a jab that had already bloodied the former junior middleweight
champion's nose and mouth, he appeared totally exhausted. For 12
minutes he repeatedly held Norris at every opportunity, refusing to
use the jab, while clinching so often that a crowd heavily in his
favor began to boo.
</P>
<P>
   This dance went on for 12 interminable minutes before the fight
ended with Rosenblatt clutching Norris like a man trying to open an
umbrella in a stiff wind.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt had piled up such a big lead that cries of protest
from Norris's cornermen over the unanimous decision were absurd,
but the bigger concern for Lake has to be whether Rosenblatt has a
physical problem. Few fighters have ever made such complete
reversals in one round as Rosenblatt has in his last two fights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's his electrolytes or something like that,'' Lake
said. ``He just seemed to hit the wall and had nothing the last two
rounds. He was totally dehydrated when it was over. Same thing last
fight. We don't know what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Evander Holyfield once had a similar problem. It manifested
itself most severely in his odd loss to Michael Moorer when Nevada
doctors thought his exhaustion resulted from a heart problem. Later
it was learned he regularly grew so dehydrated in training that it
was difficult for his body to function.After some testing, a new
approach of rehydration was begun.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps something similar is the source of Rosenblatt's sudden
somnambulent syndrome, but whatever the cause is, it needs to be
found if he hopes to climb the top rungs of the middleweight
division.
</P>
<P>
   Since he weighed in at 158 pounds and probably was 10 pounds
heavier by fight time, his exhaustion should not have been a result
of trying to make weight, as it sometimes was when he was still
battling to fight at 154 pounds. That is no longer a reasonable
weight for him, which is why Lake has rejected plans from promoter
Bob Arum to send Rosenblatt to Europe to fight for one of the
junior middleweight titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does he do with it after he wins it?'' Lake said. ``He
wouldn't be able to defend it because he couldn't make the weight.
What's the point? If he was going to fight Oscar (De La Hoya) at
154 he could do it once for the opportunity. But just to win some
title his body wouldn't let him keep makes no sense. Dana is a
mid-dle-weight.''
</P>
<P>
   It would appear so, but maybe even 160 is taking too much out of
him. Then again, maybe it's not the weight but some other problem
doctors could find after testing. Whatever it is, Rosen-blatt and
Lake need to investigate it and solve it, because if they don't,
one night his lead won't be big enough, or his fatigue will arrive
soon enough, to get him beat.
</P>

<P>
   Promoter  &UR; Don King  &LR; is being threatened with having his Florida
promoter's license suspended or revoked because of allegations
reported here that King paid $100,000 to a charity run by the
Florida State Athletic Commission's executive director,  &UR; Michael
Scionti &LR; . It is the only donation ever made to the organization,
and the charge is that King received special treatment as a result.
Scionti has denied the charges but Arizona Sen.  &UR; John McCain  &LR; has
asked Florida Gov.  &UR; Lawton Chiles  &LR; to look into the allegations of
conflict of interest. Both the governor's office and the state
attorney general's office have begun an investigation. The
allegations first came from lawyers for  &UR; Julio Cesar Chavez &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who
claimed that Scionti, because of the donation, was urging the
commission to recognize exclusive promotional contracts that
prevented a fighter from working for anyone else. Florida
previously had a rule prohibiting such exclusionary contracts but
at Scionti's urgings, it changed that position ... Arum conceded
that despite De La Hoya's popularity, nothing compares with  &UR; Mike
Tyson's &LR; . But he went on to argue that it is for the worst of
reasons. ``People will watch Tyson because he's boxing's version of
`The Truman Show,''' Arum said. ``He's lived his life in a
fishbowl. Oscar will outdraw anyone but Tyson. He's the most
popular guy in the sport.'' ... Mr. Ten Percent, fight manager
 &UR; Shelly Finkel &LR; , &UR;  &LR; showed where his loyalties truly lie when for no
apparent reason he opined, ``When Mike fights Evander again, he
will win.'' Finkel made his reputation, not to mention hundreds of
thousands of dollars, off Holyfield's sweat and heart when he was
his co-manager. Now he's Tyson's 10 percenter, so he's got the
other guy winning. Some guys have no shame ... Before the  &UR; Junior
Jones &LR; - &UR; Erik Morales  &LR; fight two weeks ago, Mexican government
officials claimed that HBO workers neglected to apply and pay for
$250 work permits. They took several to the US-Mexico border on the
eve of the fight and demanded $60,000 in fines to let them stay to
work the telecast. Mexican promoter  &UR; Fernando Beltran  &LR; managed to
``negotiate'' the fines down to $20,000, but HBO executives were
not happy about the shakedown or ringside security the night of the
fight ... HBO may have to go back to Mexico because De La Hoya has
already signed to fight former junior welterweight champion
 &UR; Frank &LR; - &UR; ie Randall  &LR; in February in Monterey if De la Hoya survives
a November fight with former World Boxing Association champion  &UR; Ike
Quartey &LR; . De La Hoya also has plans to fight  &UR; Oba Carr  &LR; and has
begun lining up  &UR; Yory Boy Campas  &LR; and  &UR; Keith Mullings  &LR; as well ...
WBA featherweight champion  &UR; Freddie  &LR; ``Mr. Hagler''  &UR; Norwood
 &LR; (31-0-1) defends his title Tuesday night in Tokyo vs. Japan's
 &UR; Koji Matsumoto  &LR; (26-5-1) ...  &UR; Floyd Mayweather  &LR; (17-0, 13 KOs)
becomes the first member of the 1996 US Olympic boxing team to
fight for a world title when he takes on World Boxing Council super
featherweight champion  &UR; Genaro Hernandez  &LR; (38-1-1, 17 KOs) Saturday
night at the Las Vegas Hilton. Young Mayweather has his father in
his corner, and both have loudly boasted that Hernandez is
finished. Bettors in Vegas must agree because they've moved the
line from Hernandez as a slight favorite to Mayweather as a 7-5
favorite. Don't bet on that ... World Boxing Organization
featherweight champion  &UR; Prince Naseem Hamed  &LR; said at a New York
press conference last week that he was not trying to avoid a
promised fight with  &UR; Kennedy McKinney  &LR; to fight  &UR; Wayne McCullough
 &LR; Oct. 31 in Atlantic City. ``The Prince doesn't dodge,'' he said.
Instead, he claimed he'd never agreed to fight McKinney, although
negotiations are ongoing. The best fight on that HBO card may be
International Boxing Federation super bantamweight champion  &UR; Vuyani
Bungu  &LR; (35-2, 18 KOs) vs.  &UR; Danny Romero  &LR; (32-3, 28 KOs) ...
Although De La Hoya's intention in their rematch was to destroy the
legend of Chavez, the WBC welterweight champion acknowledged that
it made him uneasy to watch middleweight champion  &UR; William Joppy
 &LR; do the same to 47-year-old  &UR; Roberto Duran  &LR; several weeks ago. ``It
was a sad event,'' De La Hoya said. ``It's very sad to see a
fighter of that status have to be beat down like that. But I'm
looking to beat down Chavez with no remorse whatsoever. That's my
job.'' Arum added similar feelings of unease about the beating
Duran took, saying, ``It tears your heart out. I made Duran $10
million after taxes in nine months and he's still broke. To see him
in that charade was terrible. He hasn't been able to fight since he
fought  &UR; Iran Barkley &LR; . It was awful. It's like  &UR; George Foreman  &LR; and
 &UR; Larry Holmes  &LR; (who fight Jan. 23 at the Astrodome). They can't
fight anybody real anymore.''

   IBF lightweight champion  &UR; Shane Mosley  &LR; (29-0, 27 KOs)
overwhelmed challenger  &UR; Eduardo Morales  &LR; (26-0) on the first TNT
``Title Night'' card Tuesday night. Although  &UR; Ray Leonard  &LR; was at
ringside urging Mosley to move up to 140 pounds in search of bigger
fights, Mosley said he would still like to unify the title and also
fight recently dethroned WBC champion  &UR; Stevie Johnston &LR; , &UR;  &LR; a
longtime rival ... World Boxing Union super featherweight champion
 &UR; Angel Manfredy  &LR; (25-2-1) was impressive in a hard-fought win over
game but unheralded  &UR; John Brown  &LR; (18-5-1) on the same show. Once
again Manfredy showed the world he is an action fighter who gives
customers what they're paying for. After the fight, Manfredy
claimed Brown used his head in more ways than one. ``He was using
the head more than he was punching,'' Manfredy charged. ``Kind of
hard, you know?'' ... Holyfield's view of the likelihood of a match
with  &UR; Lennox Lewis &LR; : ``I'm looking forward to fighting him. He's a
wanted man.'' ... Speaking of Holyfield, he recently admitted that
he not only had a son with his second wife,  &UR; Janice &LR; , &UR;  &LR; but also had
two other children last year with ex-girlfriends. Holyfield now has
nine children, three with his first wife,  &UR; Pauline &LR; , &UR;  &LR; one with his
second, and five with women other than his wives. For the ultimate
Christian warrior, it's a difficult situation to explain now that
it's become public, but he said last week, ``Eventually everything
in the dark comes into the light.'' ... Former Playboy model  &UR; Mia
St. John  &LR; didn't look like anyone  &UR; Christy Martin  &LR; or  &UR; Lucia Ryker
 &LR; will have to worry about, but she still impressed Arum before she
boxed on his card last week. At a press conference to hype De La
Hoya-Chavez, he noted that she was in a unique circumstance. ``In
the six years we've been doing this together, this is the first
time Oscar hasn't been the best-looking person on the dais,'' Arum
said. Trainer  &UR; Pat Goossen  &LR; said that when he met her, he put his
son in with her to see if she could fight. He came out, said
Goossen, and said, ``She can punch and she smells like soap.'' That
was enough to begin training her ... De La Hoya will take a week
off for golf and then begin training again for a Nov. 21 fight with
Quartey, who was recently stripped of the WBA title for choosing to
face De La Hoya. ``I've been looking forward to fighting Oscar for
a long time,'' Quartey said at ringside. ``I was happy what I saw
tonight (against Chavez). I didn't think it was a good fight.'' Of
course not ... Chavez, meanwhile, has already petitioned the WBC to
be allowed to move into the mandatory position at junior
welterweight. That would guarantee him first shot at the winner of
the  &UR; Miguel Angel Gonzalez &LR; - &UR; Kostya Tszyu  &LR; Nov. 28 fight for the
vacant title ... Sometimes a guy should be left well enough alone.
Last week in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, British amateur champion
 &UR; Audley Harrison  &LR; was ordered to remove his personal boxing gloves
and wear new ones minutes before entering the ring in the super
heavyweight title fight of the Commonwealth Games. Angered,
Harrison walked out and KO'd  &UR; Michael Macaque  &LR; in 65 seconds.
Harrison claimed the gloves were so tight they crimped his hand and
prevented him from making a fist. ``That really got me more angry
but it worked to my advantage because I went looking for it with
bad intentions,'' he said.

   Responding to some degree to the recent pressure put on by
Mohegan Sun's bid to enter the big-time boxing business, Foxwoods
has landed the  &UR; Roy Jones-Otis Grant  &LR; light heavyweight title fight
Nov. 14. On the same card is a better fight that also will be shown
on HBO, the rematch between  &UR; Ivan Robinson  &LR; and  &UR; Arturo Gatti &LR; .
``That's really why we bought it,'' said  &UR; Tom Whipple &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who books
fights for Foxwoods. A week earlier,  &UR; Vinny Pazienza  &LR; returns to
the ring there vs.  &UR; Kevin Pompey  &LR; in an ESPN2 show ... Everett
cruiserweight  &UR; Richie LaMontagne  &LR; is a nice kid with a future in
modeling. He has already been featured in photo spreads in some of
the country's biggest magazines. It's time he pursued that career.
Friday night, LaMontagne got bombed by a very average kid from
Detroit named  &UR; Sajjah Abdudard Aziz  &LR; in losing a six-round
decision. An hour after the fight, LaMontagne (19-3-1) looked as if
he'd gone 10 rounds with a windmill. Enough is enough.

IN THIS SHUFFLE, BIRD WAS DEALT OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to stay on with the Celtics and help them as much as
I possibly can. Hopefully, I can do a good job for them ... I'm
excited to be going into a new life. I gave my heart and body and
soul to the Celtics and hopefully we can still have a good
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Larry Bird, August 1992 &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; el1a &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Only Larry Bird and the Celtics know why things never did work
out for him in Boston. He has gone on to bigger and better things
in Indiana and the Celtics have spent $50 million to hire a new
coach. That's also the going cost of credibility these days.
</P>
<P>
   The day Bird announced his retirement as a player, the
basketball boss of the Celtics was Dave Gavitt. Chris Ford was the
coach, Jan Volk was the general manager, and there was a three-man
ownership group with a basketball-savvy individual (Alan Cohen) in
control. All are gone now. And so is Bird.
</P>
<P>
   On that rainy August day in 1992, it was assumed by everyone in
the Celtics' top-level management that Bird was going to be a
Boston lifer. Gavitt said Bird would continue to have a ``special
relationship'' with the team. Red Auerbach noted how happy he was
that Bird ``will continue to have some input in the ballclub.''
Bird was bullish, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a great organization and they're giving me an
opportunity to do something I want to do,'' said Bird. He even made
a disparaging remark about his home state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go home in the summer,'' he said of Indiana. ``I don't want
to live there in the wintertime.''
</P>
<P>
   Gavitt said he had given Bird a blank piece of paper and told
him to write down whatever job he wanted. Bird deferred. Gavitt
said, ``All right then, let's try to rule out some things.
Coaching?''
</P>
<P>
   The response from Bird: ``No way.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird wasn't kidding. He never wanted to coach, especially the
Celtics. At that point in his life, his health was his No. 1
priority and he was hearing things he didn't want to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``People forget that my back at that time was still messed up,''
said Bird, who will be in Springfield Friday for his induction into
the Basketball Hall of Fame. ``I was told that I might not be able
to do much at all. The last thing I was thinking of doing was
getting involved again. I had to take care of my back.''
</P>
<P>
   He did. He underwent a spinal fusion operation and _ voila _ he
felt good again. One by one, however, the Celtics' upper management
began to change. Gavitt was forced out. Cohen was forced out. In
1994, Celtics owner Paul Gaston decided that M.L. Carr was the man
he wanted to run his basketball operation. Bird, still on the
payroll as a consultant, started getting antsy.
</P>
<P>
   By 1997, Carr was into his third year as director of basketball
operations and second as coach. The franchise was a joke. Bird
clandestinely was assigned the task of seeking out coaching
candidates. While he was doing that, the Indiana Pacers were making
clandestine plans of their own to change coaches _ and had their
eyes on Bird.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is,'' Bird said, ``I knew (the Celtics) were going
to make wholesale changes. I knew the best thing to do was to get
out, especially with someone coming in that I didn't know.''
</P>
<P>
   In his job as coach-finder, one of those Bird approached was
Rick Pitino. They chatted a few times. When that got out, Pitino
said that he was flattered but not interested in the Boston job. He
also said that if he were to take the job, it would only be with
Bird there as well.
</P>
<P>
   Reminded of that statement, Bird suppresses a chuckle. He may
not have known Pitino was coming, but he did know that the two
could not coexist.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Pitino taking that job,'' Bird said, ``it was time for me
to move on. He was set in his ways. And I would be like Clinton _ a
lame duck.''
</P>
<P>
   That led to Indiana. Bird is happy with the choice he made. The
Celtics, presumably, are happy with theirs. The idea of a
Bird/Pitino combo may have looked appetizing on paper, but that's
about as far as it went.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be better for me and for Rick if I wasn't
there looking over his shoulder,'' Bird said. ``I needed a fresh
start and thought that maybe I could be in that position somewhere
else.''

SAVAGE WORKING HARD AND WINGING IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ He might be a rookie in training camp but
Andre Savage's ties to the Bruins were established long before the
23-year-old forward signed with Boston as a free agent last June.
</P>
<P>
   Savage, a native of Ottawa, has former Bruin coach Steve Kasper
as his agent, and Tim Watters, who was an assistant coach under
Kasper in 1995-96, coached Savage for the last two years at
Michigan Tech.
</P>
<P>
   The youngster has made coach Pat Burns take notice, and captain
Ray Bourque said he is impressed with the way Savage goes to the
net. Savage is just hoping to win a spot on the club, somehow, some
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to work hard,'' said Savage, who had a
terrific goal against the Penguins last Wednesday, beating veteran
defenseman Kevin Hatcher before firing a shot past goalie Craig
Hillier. ``I tried to do everything good in every aspect of the
game. I was just trying to give it my best every time. It helps
when you have good players to play with. Since I'm a new guy, the
older guys help me out and that makes it easier to play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Savage has had to get used to a new position: left wing. He
spent most of his college career playing center or right wing and
was the second player in school history to lead the team in scoring
three straight seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played center a few times, too, (in camp),'' said Savage,
who had 14 goals and 41 points in 33 games last season. ``I think
Pat is trying to get a feel of where he should play me. I hadn't
played left wing before a whole lot, but I'm getting used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   This training camp has been complicated because there are four
restricted free agents _ Jason Allison, Anson Carter, Kyle McLaren,
and Ted Donato _ sitting out. Workouts resemble episodes of ``Star
Search,'' with a host of young players fighting for available jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just messes up the cards more, that's all,'' said Burns.
``Savage, I thought, played a real strong game (Wednesday) and
worked hard. Peter Nordstrom had a good performance. Landon Wilson
didn't have a good performance so you're weighing it, (with
players) going up and going down. Cameron Mann had a pretty good
game, Joe Thornton played better. Jonathan Girard was so-so. So you
have the ups and downs of selecting a team where you're excited one
day and the next day you're not sure. That's the fun about training
camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Savage hasn't seemed awed by the surroundings. He and Bourque,
both French-speaking natives of Quebec province, have bonded.
Savage said he's soaking up advice like a sponge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray is a really good leader,'' said Savage. ``He always
emphasizes for me to go to the net with the puck. Things will
happen if you go to the net. Guys like him, with all the experience
they have, you know they're saying it for a reason. They know what
they're talking about. It helps when you have guys like that
helping you out.''
</P>
<P>
   Savage is well aware of the free agent situation and he's hoping
to use it to his advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you a little bit more of a chance to prove
yourself,'' he said. ``Nothing is written in stone. You have to
work hard every game and practice. If you give your best, hopefully
good things will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that attitude and his following through on it that have
impressed Burns.
</P>
<P>
   ``He works hard in the corners and comes up with the puck,''
said Burns. ``He gets some good chances. He's not an easy skater
but he gets there, he finds a way to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque said Savage reminds him a bit of Steve Heinze. Burns can
see the comparison somewhat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heinze is a little bit better of a skater,'' said Burns, ``but
he's right _ he's got that crouch position and he's got a quick
shot and a good shot and he's a good, hard worker. All those things
are in his favor.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kasper and Savage were shopping around for teams, Boston by
far showed the most interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked to the Islanders a little bit and the Rangers a
little bit,'' said Savage. ``But it was nothing really serious.
Boston was really the one who showed a real interest. That's all I
wanted was to get an opportunity, to get my foot in the door and
prove myself and hopefully I can play in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   Watters, for one, believes he can.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the offensive skills you just can't teach kids,'' said
Watters. ``His commitment was second to none. He'd do whatever he
could to make himself a better player. Boston has a good reputation
for giving young guys opportunities. I'm really glad for him.''

ANGELS LOSE AGAIN IN OAKLAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ It's a good thing for the Angels their game against
the Oakland A's on Saturday was meaningless. Otherwise, their 4-3
loss would have hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The A's Rickey Henderson _ on Rickey Henderson Day at the
Oakland Coliseum _ singled home Eric Chavez in the bottom of the
ninth to cap a two-run rally off Angels closer Troy Percival before
22,661.
</P>
<P>
   The rally was set up with one out in the ninth by shortstop
Justin Baughman, who fielded Scott Spiezio's grounder cleanly but
threw it away for an error, one of four Anaheim made in the game.
</P>
<P>
   With two out, Chavez tied the game with an RBI single, then
scored the game-winner on Henderson's single.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson was honored before the game for scoring his 2,000th
career run Aug. 31, joining Ty Cobb, Hank Aaron, Babe Ruth, Pete
Rose and Willie Mays as the only players to score 2,000 runs.
</P>
<P>
   Baughman was in at shortstop to give Gary DiSarcina a day off.
Tim Salmon and Darin Erstad also didn't play. But despite giving
some of his players the day off, the loss bothered manager Terry
Collins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because the lineup changed doesn't mean we didn't try to
win the game,'' he said. ``You play hard and you play to win. They
mean just as much to me every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Steve Sparks got knocked around by the Rangers in
his previous two starts, but on Saturday he regained the form that
helped him win six consecutive decisions during one stretch this
summer. Sparks gave up two runs (one earned) and five hits in seven
innings, helping him ensure an invitation to spring training next
season. He finished the season 9-4 with a 4.34 ERA in 22 games,
including 20 starts.
</P>
<P>
   But before he joins the Angels in Arizona next February, Sparks
will go to his home near Houston to help his wife take care of
their two children and maybe do some substitute teaching at the
local high school.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks didn't teach during the last offseason because he was
recovering from surgeries on his right elbow and left shoulder, but
he usually works in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spent my offseasons teaching, waiting tables or playing
winter ball,'' Sparks said. ``You try to make enough money to get
you through to spring training.''
</P>
<P>
   His performance this season is generally regarded as the biggest
surprise of the year for the Angels, but Sparks says he's just
happy to be here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very grateful I'm healthy and I'm grateful for the
opportunity these guys gave me,'' he said. ``(General manager) Bill
(Bavasi) made me feel wanted. I called him before spring training
for an opportunity to play, and they, more than any other team,
showed confidence in me.
</P>
<P>
   ``They moved me up from Double-A to Triple-A early on because
they took my word for it when I said I was throwing good,'' he
said. ``I really didn't have any doubts I could pitch. I've always
been confident. Whether that's being naive or not, I don't know.
Sometimes all it takes is an opportunity and a few breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Pritchett (No.2) and Jim Edmonds (No.25) hit solo homers
for the Angels, and Edmonds singled home a run in the eighth for a
3-2 lead. But Percival (2-7), going for his 43rd save, couldn't
hold it. A's reliever T.J. Mathews (7-4) got the victory.

SMU BLOWS 22-POINT LEAD IN LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Whit Canning 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ In the aftermath of an amazing mishap at the Cotton
Bowl yesterday, SMU coach Mike Cavan offered a succinct analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing good ever comes of this, and nothing ever will,'' he
said, after watching the Mississippi Rebels (3-1) score 29 late
points to overcome the Mustangs in overtime, 48-41.
</P>
<P>
   Cavan's reference was to the fact that the Mustangs (0-4) once
held a 22-point lead and played maybe their best game of the
season. Problem was, they didn't play it long enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overconfident?'' said Cavan, in reference to one query. ``How
can you be overconfident when you haven't won a game? We just did
it again _ failed to play 60 minutes. We were tired at the end
\Rafter 3 hours, 35 minutes\S, but so were they. We just haven't
learned how to play a complete football game.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Tracy Hart rolled into the end zone from 47 yards away
with an interception to give SMU a 41-19 lead with 9:45 left, it
almost seemed they had done enough.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the Rebels were reeling, having recently coughed
up the ball at the SMU 2-yard line after moving 78 yards _ and
watched SMU roll back down the field with it. Josh McCown, SMU's
freshman quarterback, had thrown three touchdown passes, two to
Albert Johnson, and Rodnick Phillips (119 yards) was ripping huge
chunks out of the defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually,'' SMU cornerback Jacoby Rhinehart said, ``I thought
we had the game won in the third quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, the bedeviled Rebels would lose four fumbles, an
interception, and nearly the game.
</P>
<P>
   But Romaro Miller (32-of-51, 351 yards) brought them back with a
scoring pass to Cory Peterson and a two-point conversion _ and then
the game turned.
</P>
<P>
   The Mustangs were soon sitting at the Ole Miss 45 after
recovering an onside kick, but were unable to move _ so Colin
Vadheim drifted a punt toward the right flag.
</P>
<P>
   It never made it. Peterson took it at the 8, tore off to the
right, and sailed 92 yards behind a wall of blue helmets _ and with
5:55 left, it was a game again, with SMU leading 41-34.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kick right!'' Cavan said, ``Kick right! We kept practicing
that, but we just didn't cover. The kicking game killed us again.''
</P>
<P>
   It still seemed like SMU's game with Ole Miss looking at a
fourth-and-seven at its 15 with 1:31 left. But Miller completed a
pass for the first down. Then with 40 seconds left, the Rebs took
their final timeout at the SMU 44.
</P>
<P>
   On the next play, Miller fired a rocket to Grant Heard _ a step
ahead of Hart in the end zone _ and a stunned throng of 22,281
generously laced with Ole Miss fans was looking at overtime.
</P>
<P>
   After throwing repeatedly throughout the afternoon, the Rebs
alternated Deuce McAlister and Joe Gunn on five consecutive rushing
plays in overtime, where teams start a possession at the opponent's
25. McAlister carried 4 yards on the last carry, thrusting his
finger into the air as he turned the corner and swept into the end
zone.
</P>
<P>
   On SMU's first snap, McCown went to the end zone for Johnson,
but the ball was off his fingertips and over the end line. After
two plays lost 6 yards, McCown went to Johnson again, but this one
sailed out of the end zone, and the Mustangs' despair was complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Explain it?'' Cavan said. ``I wish I could.'' \Nsubheds:Extra
points  &LR; body:Mississippi is now 12-0 under coach Tommy Tuberville
in nonconference games. ... The Rebels had plenty of fans on hand
to watch their first game at the Cotton Bowl since losing to Texas
on New Year's Day in 1962.  &LR; tagtop:Whit Canning, (817) 390-7760

SOSA'S CLUTCH HIT STAYS IN BALLPARK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Screaming for Sammy Sequel, the delirious crowd
yesterday at the Astrodome instead got Sammy Scrappy.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Sammy Sosa got his biggest hit of the year, and
20,000 responded with boos and exits.
</P>
<P>
   Needing a homer to keep any hope alive in his Greater Tater Race
with Mark McGwire, Sosa instead shortened his swing and grounded a
single to left field that ignited an eighth-inning rally and
spurred his Chicago Cubs to a crucial 3-2 victory against the
Houston Astros. With McGwire launching two more dingers to reach
68, Sosa stuck on 66 but propelled his team to the brink of the
playoffs with single No. 98.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark's always been ahead, and I didn't think I could catch
him,'' said Sosa, conceding the race for the umpteenth time while
washing down a huge plate of postgame pasta with a
cranberry-rasberry Snapple. ``He'll probably hit 70. It's great for
him. I've always said he was `The Man,' and I'll say it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of Sosa's spark, Gary Gaetti's two-out, two-run double
and closer Rod Beck's controversial game-ending tag-out of Astros
pinch hitter Dave Clark, a Cubs victory today will either clinch
the National League wild-card berth or allow them to play host to a
Monday playoff game at Wrigley Field against the San Francisco
Giants. Both teams enter today's finales with 89-72 records, with
the New York Mets a game back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more interested in the wild card,'' Sosa said. ``If
(McGwire) gets the record and I get the playoffs, then I'll take
that.''
</P>
<P>
   After holding a brief, 45-minute lead with his 66th homer Friday
night, Sosa's edge was Maccuumed-up as he went homerless in his
next six at-bats while McGwire pounded three in a span of two days
out of Busch Stadium 780 miles away to all but clinch the most
glamorous record in American sports.
</P>
<P>
   After fouling out to first baseman Jeff Bagwell in the first on
a 1-0 fastball, Sosa drilled a 1-1 pitch over Shane Reynolds' head
for a line-drive single in the third. Before his next at-bat, Sosa
was again behind McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   The sellout of 51,950 erupted at the video of McGwire's 67th,
then urged Sosa to retie the race. Leading off the sixth, he was
greeted by chants of ``Sam-mee, Sam-mee'' and Reynolds was heartily
booed by his own fans at each pitch out of the strike zone. On a
3-2 count, however, Sosa whiffed at a dipping splitter for his
National League-leading 169th strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   A lock for NL most valuable player, Sosa will become the first
such award winner to also lead the league in strikeouts. He almost
added to his total in a key at-bat leading off the eighth. But
after grazing two two-strike pitches from reliever Jay Powell to
stay alive, Sosa choked up on the bat and golfed a low pitch into
the hole to start a rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't thinking home run, I was thinking get on base,'' Sosa
explained. ``I was proud of that'' hit.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Sosa stepped into the on-deck circle in the ninth,
he trailed McGwire by two. Sosa was left there when second baseman
Mickey Morandini grounded out, forcing him to hope for McGwire to
go homerless today in order for him to tie with two against the
Astros, who start left-hander Mike Hampton. Should the Cubs play in
a wild-card playoff game, however, Sosa's statistics will count
toward the record.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look good, but it ain't over,'' Cubs first baseman
Mark Grace said. ``As we have seen, either one of these guys can go
out and hit two or three in a game. But the reason Sammy is so
great showed today. He did what he had to do to get us a win.''

NEBRASKA BEATS WASHINGTON, 55-7  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN, Neb. _ One play, one pitch to DeAngelo Evans was all
Bobby Newcombe was wishing for against the Washington Huskies
Saturday. The Nebraska quarterback had sat out the past two games
with a torn knee ligament. Evans, the I-back in the ground-gobbling
Cornhusker option, had been out for 21 months trying to overcome a
medical chart worth of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Newcombe and Evans got a whole lot more than a pitch together,
much to the detriment of No. 9 Washington, which was overwhelmed at
Memorial Stadium by No. 2-ranked Nebraska, 55-7.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 76,372 _ Nebraska's 223rd consecutive sellout _
watched the duo demoralize the Huskies, driving the Cornhuskers to
a 35-7 lead at half-time and never looking back. They combined for
six touchdowns in a performance reminiscent of Nebraska's 1980s
powerhouse pair of Turner Gill and Mike Rozier to hand Washington
its worst loss since a 52-0 shellacking by Alabama in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   They also reasserted something that has been forgotten in the
team's three previous games: that Nebraska is first and foremost a
running team. The Cornhuskers gained 434 yards rushing, nearly
double their average this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a statement as a team,'' said Evans, who carried 13
times for 146 yards and 3 touchdowns. ``This is Nebraska, and we're
going to do what we do _ run the ball at you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cornhuskers did it the slow, grinding way. Newcombe capped
an 11-play, 82-yard opening drive by scampering 3 yards around
right end to begin the rout. They also did it the swift, numbing
way. Newcombe flicked the ball on the option to Evans, who followed
a devastating block by wingback Shervin Wiggins and rambled 60
yards down the sideline. It was his first touchdown since December
1996, in the Big 12 championship game, when he scored 3 touchdowns
and gained 132 yards.
</P>
<P>
   From then until Saturday Evans had been sentenced to the
training room trying to overcome first an abdominal muscle tear
that required surgery, then an ankle sprain and finally cartilage
damage to a knee he injured in Nebraska's spring game.
</P>
<P>
   He had become an inspiration for an injury-riddled Cornhusker
team because of the grace and determination with which he attacked
his long climb back. And finally it was rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   Evans displayed the acceleration and sharp cuts that helped him
break the high school rushing record of Barry Sanders, a fellow
Wichita, Kan., native now with the Detroit Lions. He put a
stutter-step move that wobbled the knees of Husky linebacker Lester
Towns and then burst by to complete a 14-yard touchdown run in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   Newcombe, who was back after tearing a ligament in Nebraska's
opener, matched Evans' brilliance play for play. Newcombe, a native
of New Mexico, was attracted to Nebraska after watching Evans on
television throughout the 1996 season, when he gained 776 yards and
ran for 14 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd tell my dad that one day I'd pitch to him,'' Newcombe
said. And on his first opportunity, he pitched behind Evans, nearly
causing a turnover. ``I was so anxious to do it, I almost threw it
away,'' Newcombe said. ``It was great to see him running down the
sideline on that long one after all he's been through.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only Newcombe's second game as Nebraska's quarterback,
and he wore a knee brace, but the sophomore directed the option
like he was wired electronically to the quarterback coach, Gill. He
engineered drives of 82, 90 and 60 yards. He carried the ball 14
times and turned upfield for 79 yards and 3 touchdowns. He was 5 of
8 passing for 84 yards.
</P>
<P>
   On defense Nebraska was just as dominating, holding the Huskies
to 273 total yards. A relentless pass rush forced the quarterback,
the Heisman Trophy hopeful Brock Huard, into two fumbles and two
interceptions before he was removed from the game.
</P>
<P>
   The day's most lasting image of Huard came after Nebraska
defensive tackle Jason Wiltz picked off Huard's batted pass. The
6-foot-4-inch 310-pounder crushed the Husky quarterback on the
return, but somehow Huard hung on to the seat of Wiltz's pants like
a child to drag him down.
</P>
<P>
   The snapshot of Newcombe's and Evans' day was much warmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired,'' Necombe confessed. ``After being out for so long
and with all the worries and pressures I had to deal with, it was
kind of a fairy-tale thing today.''

2,000 RECALL GRIFFITH JOYNER, TRACK STAR WITH COMMITMENT  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAMANTHA STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MISSION VIEJO, Calif. _ The little girl had pigtails with pink
ties and diamond earrings. She wore a fluorescent pink dress and
held on to a shaggy teddy bear as she stood with a boy and girl
outside the church doors on Saturday, with relatives and friends
mingling nearby. ``Look,'' she said, as she pointed inside. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Seven-year-old Mary Ruth Joyner was looking at the shiny,
flower-draped, copper coffin of her 38-year-old mother, Florence
Griffith Joyner. Griffith Joyner, who won three gold medals and a
silver medal in track and field at the 1988 Summer Olympics, was
known not only for her extraordinary speed, but also for her beauty
and humanitarian efforts. She died at her home in Mission Viejo on
Monday morning.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Griffith Joyner's funeral service at Saddleback Community Church
was a celebration of about 2,000 people, some who had never met the
Olympian and others who had watched her from the beginning. It was
a service filled with gospel singing and readings of Scripture.
Many who eulogized Griffith Joyner defended her accomplishments. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bob Kersee, who coached Griffith Joyner, said it was Griffith
Joyner's commitment to the track and field world that first caught
his attention. Kersee _ who is married to Jackie Joyner-Kersee,
whose brother, Al Joyner, was married to Griffith Joyner _ came to
the podium and remembered Griffith Joyner with a spirited sermon
that had the audience laughing, crying, clapping and shouting
``Amen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am blessed to coach her,'' Kersee said as he told those in
the church it was time to tell the truth, alluding to news reports
and rumors that her times at the 1988 Olympics were helped by
performance-enhancing drugs, although she never tested positive for
any illegal substance. ``All of her races have been run with faith
_ not her coach or her shoes. She knew that Jesus was in her heart.
She ran a faithful race. She stopped by today to say all those
jealous, venomous words _ those jealous words can't harm her no
more. Lies can't hurt us anymore. God is protecting her from the
scorpion's bag of reporters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``She ran a race faithfully and won. She was such a good mother,
great wife, excellent daughter, fine sister, and she was a good
friend and had fans everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Mary Ruth went to the podium to be with her father, Al.
Joyner told the mourners that Griffith Joyner had always wanted to
hear her daughter sing, and so Mary Ruth and a young girl friend
took the microphones and sang a song about the wind and Jesus.
Joyner broke down and the Kersees escorted him down the stairs to
the coffin, where he kissed his wife goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   William Hybl, the president of the U.S. Olympic Committee,
spoke. He announced a special exhibit to be opened at the USOC
headquarters in the spring to honor Griffith Joyner's
accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 10 years ago, yesterday, that she ran in Seoul,'' said
Andre Phillips, who had won a gold medal in the 400-meter hurdles
there. ```Andre,' she said, `it's your turn tomorrow.' And we both
won gold. I have never been impressed or starstruck by other
athletes. At her race, I was in awe, but not shocked, by how she
performed. She just had it in her.''

MAC IS THE MAN, BUT SOSA IS MVP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Eric Karros probably put it best.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Mark McGwire has done is the most important thing to
happen to baseball in the past 20 years,'' the Dodgers first
baseman said. ``But Sammy Sosa is still the MVP.''
</P>
<P>
   Although McGwire moved ahead of Sosa in the single-season home
run record with two on Saturday, he is not the National League Most
Valuable Player.
</P>
<P>
   That is difficult to say because McGwire has been the pick in
this space most of the season. He has helped bring baseball back to
the fans. He sparked water cooler debates. He spent more time on
the nightly news than Bill Clinton _ and that wasn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cardinals, projected to win the NL Central, never got
close. It wasn't McGwire's fault the Cardinals pitching staff
disintegrated. No one noticed under McGwire's massive shadow. But
they are noticing now and it's going to cost him.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa hit 66 homers and carried the Chicago Cubs on his back for
an entire season. If you don't think those kinds of guys are
important, then you haven't been watching your Dodgers very closely
the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   The game is about winning. That is why Kevin Malone is with the
Dodgers now. That is why Fox is ready to spend $75 million on next
year's payroll.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs were not a very good team this year. But they got 19
victories from Kevin Tapani and brought up a wunderkind named Kerry
Wood. They got 49 saves out of Rod Beck, who wanted to play for the
Dodgers but couldn't because Peter O'Malley, in one of his final
acts as owner, wouldn't give Fred Claire the money.
</P>
<P>
   But none of that would have mattered without Sosa. In June, he
did much more than hit a major-league record 20 home runs. He gave
the Cubs _ baseball's lovable losers _ a reason to believe.
</P>
<P>
   Three-time batting champion Bill Madlock once said it is easier
to win awards for a winning team because you have winning to take
your mind off the records at hand. From Opening Day, McGwire had
the overwhelming task of chasing Roger Maris.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa also had the wild-card race, which still might not be
decided at the end of today when the regular season is scheduled to
end.
</P>
<P>
   He also made the home run chase fun, lightening up the
often-sullen McGwire. Sosa showed emotion, cried during nearly
every sound bite. He made even non-baseball fans wish this season
never would end.
</P>
<P>
   When this MVP ballot is mailed Monday, it will read Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   This just in: Mike Piazza will re-sign with the Mets if co-owner
Nelson Doubleday has any say in it. And Piazza will get the $100
million contract the Dodgers never offered and looked so remote
just two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have decided to make every effort we can to sign him,''
Doubleday said. ``The way things are going now for Mike here in New
York is better now than it has been. It's really his call. But Lord
knows, I want him to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends on the Dodgers say Piazza has told them he won't return
to New York, but Doubleday knows if the Yankees win the World
Series, he has no choice but to make a big splash regardless of the
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the sublime to the ridiculous, to that extent it's an
issue,'' he said. ``But any numbers we've seen or heard are not
ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Piazza is at least sounding like someone who'll
listen to the Mets' postseason offers _ which represents a
startling change of heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a lot of good experiences here,'' he said.
``I've enjoyed a lot of the guys. I think the fans have treated me
fairly. I've never complained.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was pointed out that the fans at Shea booed Piazza for
much of the summer, he replied: ``There was obviously a time early
on when I wasn't playing very well. I don't think it's been any
different for me than for anybody else who played in any other city
like New York or Philadelphia.''
</P>
<P>
   Across town: Here's what the Yankees' rotation will be in the
division series: David Wells, Andy Pettitte, David Cone and, if
necessary, Orlando Hernandez in Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Joe Torre's decision to go with Pettitte, rather than
Hernandez or Hideki Irabu, comes more from the heart than the head,
especially since the left-hander is only 2-5 with a 6.90 ERA in his
last seven starts. Still, Pettitte is 9-4 this year at home, where
Games 1, 2 and 5 will be played. Pettitte also has pitched well in
past postseasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andy's been there, there's no substitute for that. He doesn't
have anything to prove about his heart,'' said Torre, referring to
the 1-0 win over John Smoltz in Game 5 of the 1996 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's no doubt Pettitte hasn't been himself lately; his
ERA has climbed from 3.54 before Aug. 9 to 4.30 now. If Wells were
to lose Game 1, and Pettitte fails to reverse his slump in Game 2,
New York could be an ugly place this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Brown not down: Brant Brown's error in left field Wednesday that
cost the Chicago Cubs a victory in Milwaukee brought back the usual
ghosts from the collapse in 1969 and the grounder through Leon
Durham's legs in the 1984 playoff loss to San Diego. Was it just
one of those Cubs things?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just something that happened,'' Brown said. ``I don't
know how to explain it. It just stopped a little short on me and I
wasn't able to catch it. It was just a routine fly ball, nothing
troubling about that. You can say it was the wind, or the sun, but
those are elements we play with every day. Hopefully it doesn't
cost us that much.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown has had an interesting year. He became the regular center
fielder after Lance Johnson went on the DL earlier in the year. He
has also filled in at first base and in left field when others were
out. The Cubs think so much about the 27-year-old Brown that they
turned down several trade offers for him. He was among the players
Seattle reportedly asked for when the Cubs inquired about Randy
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, four days from now you can say it wasn't a Cub
thing,'' Rod Beck said after the game. ``Who knows? This just might
bring us even closer together.''
</P>
<P>
   No flash in the pan: Boston's Tom Gordon recorded his 41st
straight save Wednesday night, tying the major-league record set by
Beck and matched by San Diego's Trevor Hoffman earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Gordon got the final five outs for his 40th save,
tying the AL record set by his teammate, Dennis Eckersley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saved 48 of 50 one year (1990) when I was (bleeping) lights
out, I thought,'' Eckersley said. ``And that was pitching in a park
like Oakland. This place is a (bleeping) bandbox.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon hasn't blown a save since April 14. He now has 45 saves
this season, five more than Jeff Reardon saved in 1991 when he set
a Red Sox record.
</P>
<P>
   ``He throws strikes,'' Eckersley said. ``What amazes me is his
consistency, velocity-wise. I knew how nasty his curveball was.
He's really been focused. He's just jumped in and hasn't skipped a
beat. It's really been great to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon never dreamed about 41 straight saves. When he came to
spring training in February he didn't know what percentage of games
he'd be saving and what percentage Eckersley would be called upon
to save. Gordon started quickly this spring, Eckersley started
slowly, and Gordon became manager Jimy Williams' main man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm just so excited that I've gotten a chance to
pitch every day,'' Gordon said. ``That's what keeps me motivated.
The important thing is trying to make the playoffs, not that I'm
downplaying (the streak). I know about it because I read about it.
I just try to block as much out as I can and focus on what it takes
to get ready. Those things are not important until Sept. 27, when I
can look in the mirror, see what I've accomplished and that my team
is going to the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockie mountain winter: It appears that Colorado general manager
Bob Gebhard will remain in place and manager Don Baylor will be
replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Jerry McMorris said a few weeks ago that he still believes
this is the best team in franchise history on paper even though
they never had a leadoff hitter, center fielder or closer, and is
very upset the Rockies didn't play better.
</P>
<P>
   Gebhard has two years remaining on his contract, and Baylor only
one. It's doubtful both will go, leaving three years of salary to
eat. And since Baylor really didn't do much to light a fire under
this team, he could be the fall guy.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor appears worn out after six years of managing half the
time in a place where every game is in doubt until the last out.
His future could hinge on the availability of potential
replacements.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Leyland is the leading contender if he opts out of his
Marlins contract. Art Howe also is well-liked by McMorris and
Gebhard (read: a company man, not a loose cannon type such as Davey
Johnson). Like the Dodgers, the Rockies are interested in Felipe
Alou, who still has a year left on his Montreal contract. Gebhard
loves him and gave him his first managing job in the Expos'
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Finally: Baltimore manager Ray Miller is projecting that Cal
Ripken will play 145-150 games next year, a figure that Ripken does
not dispute, though he insists he will come back for 1999 with the
same play-all-the-time attitude he has carried into every season
since 1982. ``I've never been closed-minded to the concept of an
off day if I wasn't contributing for whatever reason,'' he said.
``If it goes in that direction and plays out that way, so be it.
But I'm going to continue coming to the ballpark with the same
exact attitude.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TOP OF THE ORDER
</P>
<P>
   Pitching wins in the postseason. The Atlanta Braves lead the
majors in ERA (3.27), complete games (24), shutouts (22),
opponents' batting average (.241), strikeouts (1,209) and fewest
home runs allowed (117). The shutout and complete game totals are
the Braves' best since 1992, when they had 24 shutouts and 26
complete games. In round one, John Smoltz will start Game 1, Tom
Glavine Game 2 and Greg Maddux Game 3. &QL; 
ROTISSERIE WATCH
</P>
<P>
   J.D. Drew, the St. Louis Cardinals top draft pick who turned
baseball on its ear last year by demanding $10 million from the
Philadelphia Phillies. In Drew's first 13 games, he has 13 RBI and
five homers. He gives the Cardinals the chance to let Brian Jordan
walk as a free agent and sign a front-line pitcher. Sounds like he
already is worth the money. &QL; 
STAT OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Cubs and New York Mets were last separated by more
than one game on Aug. 7, when the Cubs led the Mets by 1{ games.
There have been 16 lead changes or ties between the two teams since
then. But now the Mets, who lost Saturday, can only get into the
postseason if there is a playoff on Monday. &QL; 
THE BUZZ
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore second baseman Roberto Alomar said this past week he
has fond memories of the time he spent in Toronto and would not
rule out returning as a free agent if the Blue Jays are interested.
``My options are going to be open if I go on the market,'' he said.
``I'll have to wait and see what Baltimore has to say. I'm still
under contract now, but I always had fun in Toronto. There were
some great times and I can't forget that.'' &QL; 
QUOTABLE
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no different than I ever was. It's the players that have
made me look better. The thing is, I was always considered a
players' manager. That was a rap against me. But Davey Johnson was
a players' manager, too, and for him that was a strong point. I
always wondered what the difference was. The difference was the
players.'' &QL; 
_ Yankees Joe Torre, who had losing records managing the Mets,
Braves and Cardinals.

'HUSKERS QUELL DOUBTS WITH CONVINCING WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN, Neb. _ Harvest time. Time for the farmer to bring in
his crop. And time for college football teams to cultivate their
national championship chances.
</P>
<P>
   There were whispers around here _ and it wasn't just the wind
stirring the cornstalks _ wondering if Nebraska was good enough to
contend for a fourth title in five years. Sure, the 'Huskers were
ranked No. 2, but they had been less than impressive in winning
three games against teams they were supposed to beat.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's game against No. 9 Washington would prove which team
was a fraud. Here's what the Cornhuskers' dominating 55-7 victory
confirmed: Nebraska has a bumper crop, while the Huskies appear to
be all dried up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal was to make a statement,'' said center Josh Heskew,
the only returning veteran on the offensive line. ``We wanted to
come out and dominate. We've been criticized enough. Today, we
played the ninth-ranked team. We played some good ball. If you look
at the whole picture, we did a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington was the unfortunate recipient of Nebraska's wrath and
good health. For the first time this season, the 'Huskers had
quarterback Bobby Newcombe and I-back DeAngelo Evans on the field
together. Add in veteran fullback Joel Mackovicka and Nebraska has
an offense that is again capable of crooked numbers and fat stat
sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Teams that want to run option football should study Nebraska
(are you listening, Oklahoma Sooners coaches?) The 'Huskers
finished with 527 total yards, 434 of that on the ground. Evans
rushed 146 yards and three touchdowns on just 13 carries. Newcombe
had three touchdowns and gained 79 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two are big-play type of guys,'' Nebraska coach Frank
Solich said.
</P>
<P>
   Evans, who rushed for 776 yards as a freshman in 1996, was a
redshirt last season as he recovered from groin surgery. Nebraska's
attack needs an I-back who can gain yards in chunks. Evans has the
speed and moves to do that. His first TD was a 60-yard streak with
an option pitch. On his next two scores, he left defenders grasping
at air.
</P>
<P>
   Newcombe, a sophomore, might be a better quarterback than Tommie
Frazier, the hero of Nebraska's 1994 and 1995 title teams. Newcombe
jump started the 'Huskers' first TD drive with two impressive
scrambles. He has good timing on option pitches and he is a
deceptive runner.
</P>
<P>
   Washington was Newcombe's first ``big game'' as Nebraska's
quarterback. He confessed he was more worried last week about four
tests and a paper that was due Thursday. When you cover 40 yards in
4.4 seconds, you worry about the important things, not about
dodging 240-pound linebackers.
</P>
<P>
   One-game snapshots can be misleading. Florida State, Notre Dame
and Florida all took turns as one-week title contenders. Champions
are judged in the context of a full season.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska's season and championship hopes will be determined Nov.
14 in Manhattan, Kan., against Kansas State. Games with Texas A&AMP;M
(in College Station), Oklahoma State and Missouri should be mere
preludes, if yesterday is any indication.
</P>
<P>
   So now we know. When healthy, the 'Huskers are as talented as
any team in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one game. We're 4-0,'' said Solich, who downplayed any
messages his team sent yesterday. ``The players felt this was a key
game for us. It was. But so were the first three and so is the next
one and the game after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds a lot like Tom Osborne. Looks a lot like the same ol'
Nebraska.

OATES TO RETURN AS RANGERS MANAGER FOR '99 SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Rangers owner Tom Hicks yesterday eliminated the
possibility for distractions and embarrassing questions during the
postseason by assuring that manager Johnny Oates will return for
the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks, who indicated previously that Oates' status would be
determined after the season, informed the manager of his decision
yesterday morning before the Rangers' 5-2 loss to the Seattle
Mariners at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   Club president Tom Schieffer and general manager Doug Melvin
recommended their manager be retained after the Rangers captured
their second American League West title during Oates' four-year
tenure Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been Doug's recommendation and Tom's ever since I've
been involved,'' Hicks said, ``but I thought it was important for
this franchise that we achieve what we felt was a reasonable goal
of winning the AL West once we made those deals at the trade
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean they wouldn't have been back if they hadn't
won it, but I would have wanted some answers as to why.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks' invitation for Oates' return did not include a contract
extension, Schieffer said. Oates already has a contract signed
through next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we've gotten to that point,'' Schieffer said.
``Johnny is under contract for 1999. I think what Tom was trying to
do was put to rest all the stories and speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers became the division's team to beat after Melvin
acquired right-hander Todd Stottlemyre, shortstop Royce Clayton and
third baseman Todd Zeile on July 31. Yet, the AL West title
remained in doubt until the Rangers completed their three-game
sweep of the second-place Anaheim Angels last week in Anaheim,
Calif. Hicks remained noncommittal regarding Oates' future and
offered hints of reservations despite the Rangers' five consecutive
September victories against the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what accountability is all about,'' Hicks said. ``He's
performed, and the team performed.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates and members of his staff, though, were antsy enough about
their futures to begin making phone calls to other organizations in
case they found themselves unemployed, one major-league official
said.
</P>
<P>
   Oates' return also means that members of his staff _ pitching
coach Dick Bosman, bench/infield coach Bucky Dent, third-base coach
Jerry Narron, hitting instructor Rudy Jaramillo, bullpen coach
Larry Hardy and first-base/outfield coach Ed Napoleon _ will be
invited to return and will likely accept that offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a job,'' Oates said. ``I'm happy for our coaches.
They deserve a lot of credit for the success this organization has
had over the past four years.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks' decision also means that Oates' employment status will
not be the subject of national scrutiny during the playoffs and
thereby become a distraction for the Rangers. Oates downplayed the
significance of recent speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pay no attention to it,'' Oates said. ``I've got a job to
do. I don't play that game.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Rangers' upcoming playoff series made the
timing of this decision correct, Schieffer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get this close very often, and it was important to
us that we take full advantage of this opportunity without any
distractions,'' Schieffer said.

EVANS A HIT, HUARD HIT HARD IN NEBRASKA'S WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN, Neb. _ DeAngelo Evans couldn't wait to get hit. Brock
Huard couldn't wait for the hitting to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the contrast. Evans made a triumphant return as
Nebraska's I-back, gaining 146 yards and scoring three touchdowns.
With Evans juicing the offense, the second-ranked 'Huskers (4-0)
strolled to a 55-7 victory against ninth-ranked Washington here
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was relaxed but nervous,'' said Evans, a sophomore who sat
out last season with an injury and hadn't played in a game since
Dec. 7, 1996. ``The nerves went away with the first hit. That's
what I had been waiting for.''
</P>
<P>
   Huard, the Huskies' junior quarterback, found himself in the
middle of a redclad stampede. He was sacked three times and
pressured on nearly all of his 32 pass attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was worried about somebody taking his head off,'' Nebraska
defensive end Chad Kelsay said. ``He said, `Stop hitting me.' He
was starting to whine a little bit. You could see he wasn't
comfortable in the pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   Huard completed 18 passes for 160 yards and one touchdown before
being relieved in the third quarter. He threw two interceptions and
lost two fumbles. Washington had six turnovers and 12 penalties for
144 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``This stings, this hurts,'' Huard said of Washington's worst
loss since a 62-13 loss to UCLA in 1973. ``You just want to crawl
into a hole.''
</P>
<P>
   The hole was provided by Nebraska's offense. The 'Huskers' first
touchdown drive was 82 yards (actually 92 after a penalty and a
loss) in 11 plays. The second touchdown was a one-play strike:
Evans 60 yards on an option pitch. After Huard's first
interception, the 'Huskers scored to make it 21-0 late in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think at halftime, all of their running backs were averaging
seven yards a carry,'' Washington coach Jim Lambright said. ``We
obviously didn't have very good answers with our defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Nebraska gained 384 yards in a 27-14 victory in
Seattle. Yesterday, the 'Huskers had 434 yards rushing, averaging
6.4 yards per attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska coach Frank Solich figured he would have an explosive
offense with sophomore Bobby Newcombe at quarterback and Evans at
I-back. But yesterday was the first game the two had played
together; Newcombe missed the 'Huskers' last two games with a knee
injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all happy for DeAngelo, we're delighted to see him play
and play so well,'' Solich said. ``It's been a struggle for him,
and he's come through an awful lot. With DeAngelo and Bobby, it
causes a lot of headaches for the defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The 'Huskers hoped that a veteran defense would allow the team's
untested offense time to jell. The jell hardened against
Washington. Evans rushed for 776 yards as a freshman and provides
the I-back speed the 'Huskers' offense requires.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one game, and I don't want to make too much of it,''
Evans said. ``But it was kind of like a fairy tale for me.''

Safe at home Nebraska extended its home-field winning streak to 45
games with its 55-7 defeat of Washington. The Huskies were the last
team to beat the 'Huskers in Lincoln (36-21 on Sept. 21, 1991).

 &HT;    He looks Young again
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Servic
<TEXT>
<P>
   San Francisco _ Steve Young is back, and for the Atlanta
Falcons, that's not good. Judging by the way the 49ers quarterback
played in his first two games _ passing for more than 300 yards and
throwing three touchdown passes in consecutive games for the first
time _ it looks as if the great-great-great grandson of Brigham
Young is as good as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Or better.
</P>
<P>
   And this is the man who last year tied Sammy Baugh's NFL record
with his sixth NFL passing title and a 104.7 rating.
</P>
<P>
   With no lingering effects from several concussions in a 14-year
pro career, and a healthy throwing elbow for the first time since
1996, Young looks young again.
</P>
<P>
   He sure isn't playing like a man who'll turn 37 two weeks from
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks better than he has for the last three or four
years,'' 49ers line coach Bobb McKittrick told the San Francisco
Chronicle. ``His elbow doesn't hurt. His head doesn't hurt. Now he
has confidence in all his (wide) receivers (Jerry Rice, Terrell
Owens and J.J. Stokes). And he still has that innate ability to
pull it down and make a first down (running).''
</P>
<P>
   When the 49ers thrashed the Redskins 45-10 on Monday Night
Football on Sept. 14, Young took off around end, ran for 20 yards
and got smashed by Washington cornerback Darrell Green. Young
popped up, patted Green on the helmet and ran to the huddle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a strong move,'' said Young, who also ran 9 yards for a
TD against Washington. ``It just was not a very good move. It seems
like old times. We're back to where we have the weapons, and we
have the wherewithal and the coach is making the calls.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco coach Steve Mariucci is allowing Young to do more
this year because he's healthy, Owens and Stokes have matured, Rice
has returned and Young has a quality backup in Ty Detmer.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, Young has completed 47-of-78 passes for 666 yards, six
TDs and just one interception, for a 108.2 passer rating, second in
the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Young said the offense is still ``ratty'' and can improve. ``We
feel good about it,'' he said. ``But my gosh, we've got to keep
working. You arrive in January; you don't arrive in September.''

 &HT;    No fade for Rice
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ The irony is such that it causes a man who
has played 13 seasons with ice water coursing through his veins to
well up with uncharacteristic passion. Having long ago secured his
place in NFL history, Jerry Rice now is trying to define his niche
in the San Francisco 49ers wide-receiver corps.
</P>
<P>
   At least for the first two games of the season, Rice conceded
late last week, the quest to fit in with youngsters Terrell Owens
and J.J. Stokes has been more a struggle than he initially
imagined.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a major adjustment for me,'' Rice allowed as the
49ers completed their preparations for today's game against the
Atlanta Falcons. ``I had myself convinced that everything was fine.
I thought I had come to grips with everything in my mind. But we
started playing games, and it was obvious I'd been fooling myself
somewhat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of felt like I was the third wheel on the bicycle.
And, yes, it was frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   That frustration manifested itself late in San Francisco's 45-10
victory at Washington two weeks ago. In front of a national
audience for the Monday night game, Rice blew up on the sideline,
complaining to coach Steve Mariucci about not getting the ball
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Rice had a team-high four catches in the game, but did not score
and was dragged down from behind by Redskins cornerback Darrell
Green after a 57-yard reception. Rice also dropped an easy pass
earlier in the game and made some poor route adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, a contrite Rice, labeling his conduct as
``unprofessional,'' apologized to Mariucci, his teammates and even
the media. Rice vowed that such a display will not be repeated, and
he probably will be overly conscious of that promise.
</P>
<P>
   While the tensions have subsided, some questions remain how a
player accustomed to being ``the man'' for his entire career will
react when required to be simply a mortal in an offense loaded with
other big-play performer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still going to look to Jerry in the clutch,''
quarterback Steve Young said. ``But we don't always have to look to
him now. It's a big change for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammates and coaches privately acknowledge that even if it has
been difficult for him to share the load with Stokes and Owens,
simply toting the weight of having been the premier playmaker in
NFL history is every bit as burdensome. Stokes and Owens blossomed
as a tandem last year after knee surgery caused Rice to miss all
but two games.
</P>
<P>
   His individual brilliance and the expectations that accompany
it, some veterans noted, might be too much for any 36-year-old
player to live up to. Not surprisingly, Rice doesn't agree that his
past accomplishments represent a now-unattainable benchmark.
</P>
<P>
   If his reputation not only precedes him but also follows him
around like a lost puppy, it won't help him a bit on Sunday
afternoons, Rice insisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cornerbacks still know I'm going to bust my rear end to
get open,'' Rice said. ``The work ethic isn't any different. If
anything, the past year made me work harder and has made me
appreciate things a little more.''
</P>
<P>
   The year began with Rice's wife barely surviving a difficult
pregnancy, which caused him to consider retirement seriously. Then
came the knee surgery in September, when he was injured in the
season opener at Tampa Bay. He became the first player to return in
the same calendar year from reconstructive surgery, but the
groundbreaking rehabilitation was ruined when Rice sustained a
broken kneecap in December, and he missed the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Nine months after the second injury, Rice still bristles at
suggestions _ including one by former 49ers coach Bill Walsh _ that
his hasty return was ill-advised. Clearly, though, it was born in
part by Rice's ego. His physical prowess largely overshadows that
ego, but it's still a major part of what motivates Rice.
</P>
<P>
   Once, for example, he complained, with racial overtones, that he
was underappreciated _ after a Super Bowl victory in which he won
MVP honors. Despite his league-record 177 touchdowns, he still begs
for the ball in the ``red zone.'' And while he holds every career
receiving mark, the tantrum in Washington hardly was the first time
he had chafed at not getting the ball enough.
</P>
<P>
   It has to be difficult being just one of the Niners' three
talented wide receivers instead of the player everyone else was
trying to complement. For example, in their breakout '97 season,
Stokes and Owens combined for 118 catches, 1,669 yards and 12
touchdowns; just three years ago, Rice had better numbers by
himself _ 122 receptions for 1,848 yards and 15 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   That he'll neverapproach such gaudy numbers again is the reality
Rice must reconcile himself to. The process, he said, is a work in
progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I've got to deal with,'' Rice said. ``Some days
I'll get mine, and some days they'll get theirs. For the good of
the team and my own sanity, it's just something I've got to work my
way through.''

 &HT;    Houseboat Row may be sunk
 &HT;    By Jenny Staletovich
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEY WEST _ The island's famed Houseboat Row nearly disappeared
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of fighting with city officials who wanted to
condemn the ragtag collection of vessels docked along Roosevelt
Boulevard on the ocean, residents returned Saturday to find all but
four of the 26 boats smashed against the sea wall or each other,
and listing badly. Structurally, these homes suffered the worst of
the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was going to be OK, but after that eye went over
I knew we were in trouble,'' said Dave Tinkler, whose boat, the
Tenacity, survived but took a beating when a neighboring boat blew
loose off its moorings.
</P>
<P>
   As the sky lightened Saturday, residents who sought shelter
during the daylong storm began wandering back.
</P>
<P>
   Even before they reached their boats, the road provided an
ominous warning: Up and down the road, seaweed and sand buried the
pavement. The sea wall crumbled at one point, washing debris and
concrete across four lanes. At the docks, houses barely floated in
a muck of debris. The back half of the My Home dipped underwater
and two boats flattened a sailboat between them. Another's roof was
torn off and dropped on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Brothers Buster and A.C. Busby arrived to find Buster's dinghy
tossed onto the road. They sank his 32-foot Georgia Pearl before
the storm, hoping it would fare better underwater than above.
Because winds and surf continued to pound the shore Saturday, they
will have to wait to assess the damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been there since the 1960s,'' A.C. Busby said. ``Oh heck.
We'll just get it tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Halin, who lives aboard a 22-foot sailboat, parked his van
on the road and holed up inside so he could watch the boat from his
rear-view mirror during the storm. When it tilted up like a rocket,
he suspected trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just blew clear across the street,'' he said, pointing
toward a hotel where his boat sat in the yard.
</P>
<P>
   Worse yet, Halin quickly realized his van was only a little
safer than the boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't do it again,'' he said. ``It got pretty hairy. It
tried to come off its wheels.''
</P>
<P>
   While Halin's van won't start, he said his boat looks unharmed
and will probably sail again if he can get a wrecker to carry it
back to Houseboat Row.
</P>
<P>
   That is, if there is a row after Saturday. Some residents
suspect officials will try to condemn the area now and permanently
remove the boats.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the politicians tried to do in 10 years, the storm did in
an hour,'' Tinkler said.

 &HT;    Andruw focusing on playoffs, not steals
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Unless Andruw Jones finds a way to steal three bases
today, his quest to become baseball's youngest player with 30 home
runs and 30 steals will fall short.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'd be nice but if it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen,''
Jones said. ``If I had run more early, right now I wouldn't have
this kind of problem. I just got to let it go and look forward to
trying next season.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, whose two-run double with the bases loaded in the sixth
broke open the Braves' 4-0 win, has completed a late push that far
surpassed a bunch of stolen bases. He is hitting .301 with 15
homers and 35 RBIs the last two months. His defense should bring
him his first Gold Glove.
</P>
<P>
   But factoring in his 11 steals in the last 31 games brought his
season an historic tinge. At 21 years and five months, he enters
the final game of the year with 31 homers and 27 steals. The
youngest 30-30 man in baseball history is Seattle's Alex Rodriguez,
who was 23 years, two months when he reached the 30-30 July 19 this
season (and has since reached 42 homers with 45 steals).
</P>
<P>
   Hence, Jones has another shot at Rodriguez's record next year.
He also wants to raise his average. He takes a .274 average into
the last day, a number affected by his 127 strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you the truth, I can be a .300 hitter,'' he said.
``It's hard when you start in a slump with such a low batting
average (.196 after 29 games) and try to come all the way up. If I
had started with a huge season, I probably would have kept (his
average) up that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care,'' he said. ``What matters is the World Series.
That's what I want this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Burp
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Norm Charlton gave the club a scare Saturday when
trainer Jeff Porter had to scurry to the mound after one batter in
the ninth. No injury. Just flu. Charlton called to the dugout when
he momentarily thought he was going to get sick on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wouldn't have bothered me either,'' Charlton said with a
shrug. But he had to leave the game suffering from what Porter
called a 24-hour flu. Kerry Ligtenberg came on to finish the game.
Charlton, with one run allowed in his last 12 appearances, remains
in competition with rookie Odalis Perez for a second left-hander's
spot on the postseason roster.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart fine, thank you
</P>
<P>
   Keith Lockhart reported no discomfort in his right hamstring the
morning following his first start in two weeks, and then played the
final three innings Saturday without incident. He tested the injury
twice on fielding plays Friday and quickly allayed some of the
club's fears about his readiness for the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some sprint-type stuff but the only way to play it
was aggressively,'' Lockhart said. ``So I ran and just held my
breath and really felt fine. I was happy with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no one in the park was more surprised than he was with
his fifth-inning homer, Lockhart's ninth of the season. It carried
over the 390-foot mark at the Braves bullpen, the deepest point of
right field. The second baseman was more than puzzled when the
homer was announced as 388 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did it hit (right fielder Butch) Huskey in the head and bounce
over? At least give me 390,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael's rib
</P>
<P>
   Mike Cather visited the clubhouse Saturday morning, nearly 2 1/2
weeks after a three-inch section of his first rib was surgically
removed to free a blocked artery that was restricting blood flow to
his right arm. The condition, called thorasic outlet syndrome,
should be corrected to allow Cather, whose 2.39 ERA led all Braves
relievers in 1997, to be ready for spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Shipped to Richmond last July 15 after allowing 13 hits in eight
appearances, Cather began experiencing numbness in his arm lasting
up to 40 minutes after he would pitch. He could not even make a
fist after coming out of games. Tests done last month determined
the first rib placed enough pressure on the artery when he came to
a set position to cut off circulation for three to four seconds to
his arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess there was a lot of scar tissue around the artery that
had attached to the rib,'' Cather said. ``It was worse than they
thought it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Farm business
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have dropped Eugene (Ore.) as their short-season
Class A farm club and have signed a two-year agreement with the
Jamestown (N.Y.) Jammers of the New York-Penn League. Like Eugene,
Jamestown, an affiliate of the Detroit Tigers for the last five
years, plays a 74-game low-Class A schedule. The Braves had been
affiliated with Eugene since 1995.

 &HT;    On deck: New York Mets
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When: 1:10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   TV/Radio: Fox Sports South, WSB 750-AM.
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: RHP Armando Reynoso (7-2, 3.24; 0-6,
6.37 lifetime vs. Braves) vs. RHP Greg Maddux (17-9, 2.24; 21-12,
3.47 lifetime vs. Mets).
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Greg Maddux still leads the National League in ERA, has
thrown the most shutouts in the league (five), allowed the third
lowest batting average in the league (.220), leads the Braves staff
in strikeouts (201), in innings pitched (245) as well as complete
games (nine). So what's wrong with this picture? He has lost three
straight, is 5-7 in the second half and has accumulated a 5.40 ERA
in his last six starts. The worst hitting club in the majors, the
Arizona Diamondbacks, knocked him for 10 hits and five runs in his
last outing. The record is not all his fault. The Braves failed to
score more than three runs in any of his seven second-half losses.
Five times, they scored two or fewer and twice, they were shut out.
But he enters the day having allowed four earned runs in his last
16 1/3 innings. Reynoso has never beaten Atlanta.

 &HT;    It isn't over, even when it's over
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- On the door to the Braves clubhouse at Turner Field,
there is posted a letter on Time Warner stationery.
``Congratulations on winning the National League East Division
Championship,'' it reads. ``I'm proud of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted Turner signed it, and it's nearly two weeks old. Now it's
about time for another mash note from the boss, for winning 105
games and setting a new record for all Braves, back through the
days of the Bees, Doves, Beaneaters and all the other monikers
they've gone by. One record they don't want was set in 1935. Those
Braves lost 115 games. The next year they changed their name to
Bees, but the losing went on.
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward here to the ninth inning Saturday. Todd Hundley of
the New York Mets, pinch-hitting, swings at a third strike, becomes
the 27th out. The 161st game of the season is over. The Braves have
won, 4-0. Bobby Valentine stands at the dugout railing, transfixed,
looking up at the fireworks belching out of the oversized Coca-Cola
bottle in left field. It had been a day of dry throat, a lot of
nervous swallowing, spitting cotton, for viewing with concern. It
wasn't the official end, but if you peered hard, you could see the
dark at the end of the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   This was no time for a losing streak, but this was the Mets'
fourth in a row. The little manager had gone to his best. His ace,
Al Leiter. Seventeen-game winner, third best earned-run average in
the league. For three innings, he was perfect. By the sixth inning,
he was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine kept making moves. By the time shadows fell across the
field, he had used nearly everybody on his side but Jay Horowitz,
the Mets nonathletic media director, but he could change nothing.
The Braves got to Leiter for three runs in the sixth, the Mets
couldn't make a dent in the five pitchers Bobby Cox marched in and
out. It was like spring training, or more likely, a postseason
tryout camp. Cox started his only 20-game winner, Tom Glavine, but
true to the game plan, by the sixth inning, Glavine was gone,
leaving a shutout behind. That's the way it goes with this crazy
game these days. The hell with individual records, call in ``Iron
Mike'' if he can win.
</P>
<P>
   It's some kind of luxury for a manager when he can go to the
bullpen for relief from 17- and 15-game winners, Kevin Millwood and
Denny Neagle. It was pure irony that Neagle should have been the
winning pitcher. For a stretch last summer, try as hard as he
might, he became ``Losing Pitcher'' Neagle. Started 14 times and
lost 10. This time, he walked in from the bullpen, pitched two easy
innings and won his 16th. Sometimes the gods don't make sense.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, the Braves offense was the Jones offense. Chipper
knocked in the first run with a neat little single, Andruw knocked
in the next two with a ripping double into the left field corner.
Javier Lopez added the fourth with his 34th home run, and a story
goes with that.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez had come to bat twice with the bases loaded. The first
time, he popped up to John Olerud. The second time, he struck out.
He comes up the last time with nobody on and hits it out. Like I
say, sometimes the gods don't make sense.
</P>
<P>
   That touches on the case of the other catcher, the vaunted Mike
Piazza. This is your pick-up guy in the batting order. When nobody
else can get it done, look to this ``Iron Mike.'' He was as futile
as Lopez. Came to bat with two Mets on and waved weakly at a third
strike. Came up again with the bases loaded. This could have ripped
it, but he punched a little floater to Gerald Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing for the Braves now but a little fun. Well, not so fast
there. ``We've still got a lot to get done,'' said Cox, winner of
105 games in 1998. Some managers are never happy unless they have a
crisis they can create.

   ATLANTA _ The showdown between Florida A&AMP;M and Tennessee State
in the 10th annual Atlanta Football Classic at the Georgia Dome
Saturday evening was characterized by turnovers for one team, and
penalties and missed opportunities by the other.
</P>
<P>
   It also included a total of 89 passes and 980 yards total
offense.
</P>
<P>
   The Rattlers of FAMU (3-1), who turned the ball over five times
in the first half, managed to overcome their mistakes to post their
eighth straight victory over TSU (1-2), this one by a margin of
31-23 before a record Classic crowd of 51,726.
</P>
<P>
   That figure exceeded by 4,323 the number that watched these
teams play in the Classic at Bobby Dodd Stadium in '89.
</P>
<P>
   FAMU was not assured of victory in this fifth meeting in Atlanta
until a pass by Tigers' quarterback Leon Murray was tipped away
from junior receiver Corey Sullivan in the end zone with 31 seconds
left.
</P>
<P>
   Senior wideout Tariq Qaiyim, who had been in Rattlers coach
Billy Joe's doghouse after he dropped two TDs in FAMU's 21-14
opening loss to Hampton, helped deliver victory with fourth-quarter
touchdown receptions of 26 and 31 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's out of the doghouse now,'' Joe said.
</P>
<P>
   With FAMU ahead 17-10, Qaiyim caught his first TD pass thrown by
game MVP Pat Bonner. After TSU had narrowed the gap to 7 again as a
result of an 85-yard pass from Murray to Sullivan, Qaiyim caught
the clincher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I redeemed myself. It was blessing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   TSU forced five turnovers in the first 25 minutes, but failed to
fully capitalize on them. In large measure, that was because of a
rash of penalties. In all, the Tigers were flagged 21 times for 165
yards. Two penalties were levied against the same player after he
removed his helmet following TSU touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to blame anyone (for all of the penalties),''
Tigers coach L.C. Cole said. ``We've got to look at ourselves. But
I take my hat off to this team because it didn't quit. We're still
building, so we'll be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe, who called Cole's team ``one of the fastest improving team
in I-AA,'' knew that when the Tigers failed to take advantage of
the Rattlers' mistakes they were in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five turnovers in the first half, we should've been down by 40
points,'' Joe said. ``But instead of being behind, we were leading
at half (14-10). I knew all we had to do was settle down.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the penalties and the subsequent scoring
opportunities that went by the board for TSU, the Tigers had a
chance to tie it. They narrowed the gap to the final margin when
senior receiver Tyrone Butterfield caught a pass that was touched
five times in the end zone with 4:33 remaining,
</P>
<P>
   But Murray's pass to Sullivan in the end zone with less than a
minute left was tipped away.

 &HT;    San Francisco poses key test for Falcons
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Don't look at it as a football game, but as a
game of King of the Mountain. That's how the Atlanta Falcons are
approaching today's game against the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   To get to the top of the NFC West, they've got to knock off the
king _ the team that's won 13 of 17 division titles and five Super
Bowls since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   It's great Atlanta has won eight of 10 games since last year's
1-7 start. A first-ever win at Carolina on opening day was
fabulous. The team's first 2-0 start since 1986? That's wonderful,
too.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact the Falcons have beaten three of the other four
teams in their division since Dan Reeves took over as coach last
year, their 5-2 record against New Orleans, St. Louis and Carolina,
nothing is validated until Atlanta slays the big dog _ the 49ers
(2-0).
</P>
<P>
   ``They got something we want,'' Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   And to get it, ``We've got to go through San Francisco,'' said
quarterback Chris Chandler. ``Everyone knows that.''
</P>
<P>
   Talking won't get it done, not against a team averaging 530.5
yards. Not against a team that has beaten the Falcons six straight
times here by an average score of 43-16.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the running game will have get going early. The
Falcons are ranked 27th in the NFL in rushing, averaging 85.5 yards
per game. They're averaging 22.5 yards in the first half. Try that
today, and it may be over by halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll take everything we've got; you've got to concentrate
every single play,'' Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons aren't quite looking at this game as do-or-die. They
know they must beat San Francisco sooner or later. They'll try
today, but if it doesn't work out, the 'Niners come to Atlanta Nov.
15.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we win, we've come a long ways,'' Reeves said. ``If we
lose, it's not the end of the season. What I'm looking for is ...to
see if we've closed any ground.''

 &HT;    Something about Edisto Island
 &HT;    By Kent Mitchell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Edisto Island, S.C. _ Don't go to Edisto Beach State Park
looking for amusement parks or people dressed in funny clothing
driving golf carts.
</P>
<P>
   It's a peaceful paradise for stressed-out folks who need a
vacation according to Webster's definition: freedom from any
activity; rest; respite; intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Few vacation destinations offer any of the above these days.
</P>
<P>
   That mouse place in Orlando specializes in long lines. Most
beach resorts come with traffic, mobs on the sand and T-shirt shops
every few steps. Other camping locations usually involve frantic
travel to tourist sites.
</P>
<P>
   Not Edisto. The town doesn't even have a McDonald's because
there aren't enough people around during the offseason to support
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't trip over Edisto,'' said Rob Achenberg,
superintendant of Edisto Beach State Park. ``It's definitely a
destination-point vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   The island, 45 minutes south of Charleston, is roughly 14 miles
by 21 miles, most of it uninhabited, with seven miles of beach.
It's 19 miles from S.C. 174 and another 20 or 30 from I-95.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the 100-plus campsites are booked solid nearly year-round,
and it is one of the few state parks anywhere that is
self-supporting. Edisto's major product is peace and quiet. In some
ways, the state-park beach of more than one mile resembles
Cumberland Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look north, you look south, and you don't see
high-rises,'' Achenberg said. ``Basically, you're alone. Maybe
you'll see some loggerhead turtle tracks.''
</P>
<P>
   A midweek crowd in September numbered about 10 along the park's
beach. A couple could stroll along, look back and see only two
pairs of tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Night beach walks are even better. The pollution-free sky is
ablaze with stars never seen in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Sea shells can be found in piles on the beach and are
intermingled with fossils. It's a collector's heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Anglers love it because of the variety of fish available from
the Atlantic and salt marsh creeks.
</P>
<P>
   One such angler is Tom Thompson, 66, a retired U.S. Army master
sergeant from Aiken, S.C. Thompson spends a lot of time at Edisto,
sometimes with his wife and sometimes ``batching'' it on a fishing
trip.
</P>
<P>
   On this trip, he was catching a lot of shrimp, some sea trout, a
redfish or two, and explaining some of the park's uniqueness.
</P>
<P>
   Being on a barrier island, Edisto's state park isn't
particularly neat and manicured like many inland ones.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of sand and a sparsity of grass. The grass that
does grow looks a lot like what would be weeds back home.
</P>
<P>
   Palmetto fronds litter the ground, which could look sloppy, but
there's a purpose. Cutting firewood is prohibited, and all campers
seem to want a campfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of buying wood at the camp store, why not burn
palmetto fronds?'' Thompson asks.
</P>
<P>
   And enjoy something that is becoming as rare as diamonds rest,
respite and intermission, doing nothing.

   Hamilton in element
</P>
<P>
   By Tom McCollister
</P>
<P>
   STAFF WRITER
</P>
<P>
   MARTINSVILLE, Va. _ If there were a briar patch for race-car
drivers, as there is for B'rer Rabbit, Bobby Hamilton would head
straight for Martinsville Speedway. It's not his favorite track on
the Winston Cup circuit, but he's always felt comfortable there.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton goes to Martinsville believing thatwhen you go to a
track like this one you run well. You're always around at the end
and with a lot of brakes left. Always the sign of a good car and
driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``It boosts your confidence level to know you're going there
with that caliber of race car,'' Hamilton said. ``It makes you feel
like things are a little easier.''
</P>
<P>
   This is where he cruised to victory in April's Goody's 500,
starting from the pole and leading 377 of the 500 laps. And it's
where, since 1995, he's finished fourth or better in every race.
</P>
<P>
   Since his perfect run here in April, however, Hamilton hasn't
found another Martinsville. He surprised all with a second-place
finish at Sears Point, but he has no other top-fives in the last 10
events.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've struggled some in qualifying this year, had some
opportunities to win if we'd qualified better,'' team owner Larry
McClure said. ``We went through a crew-chief change, hiring Charley
Pressley, and we're excited about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby gave us back-to-back top-10s at Richmond (sixth) and
Dover (10th), and I'm looking for us to have some success over the
last seven races. All these race tracks we're going to, Bobby has
won three of them before coming to us, and we've won at the other
two (with Sterling Marlin). I think we're moving in the right
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The team's immediate goal is to finish in the top 10 in points,
and winning one of the last seven events would be welcome, although
not expected.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton is primed for today's NAPA 500, but he's looking longer
term. A new car has been built for the back-to-back
restrictor-plate races at Talladega and Daytona.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like 'em,'' Hamilton said about restrictor plate races.
``That's one of the big reasons I wanted to come to this team. I
knew the success of this race team. I'm labeled a short-track,
flat-track driver, and I hate it. I want to win Daytona and
Talladega. I know that this is the race team that can do it for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get in a pressure standpoint when you're running
back-to-back like that, but it doesn't bother me whatsoever.
Another thing that comes into play is the (Winston Cup) points
deal. It's not going to be like the races were earlier in the
season. I'm hopping it will be a smarter race because of the points
battle and people won't (be) as wild and tear up as much stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   But first there's Martinsville, whose points count as much as
those at Daytona and Talladega.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be as good at Martinsville as I was last time,'' Hamilton
said. ``But I look for two or three others to be better than they
were. We haven't had a bad year. We haven't had that many top-10s,
but we came close to winning a road course, and we won a race.
We've just got to get it consistent. ``It's important for me for
two reasons,'' he said. ``It's important for all the people on the
race team. They had not a terrible year last year, but it certainly
wasn't the year that caliber race team should have. So, it's
important for me to do that for the guys and everybody that works
on the car and anybody that has anything to do with the team.''

   WINSTON CUP
</P>
<P>
   Mattei, Bodine split as partners
</P>
<P>
   Jim Mattei and Geoff Bodine have ended their partnership. Mattei
purchased Bodine's remaining ownership in the team, but Bodine
apparently will stick around for the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a positive move,'' Mattei said. ``I'm excited about
Geoff being able to focus exclusively on driving and continuing to
achieve the level of performance that he has the past few weeks.
With seven races left, we still have an opportunity to make our
presence felt in the Winston Cup series.''
</P>
<P>
   Bodine views the partnership break as a relief. ``A lot of
things have gone on with this team during the past four-plus years
_ some really good, some not so good,'' Bodine said.
``Relinquishing my ownership of the team helps put the negative
things behind me and will enable me to concentrate on driving and
working with the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Bodine currently ranks 28th in the Winston Cup driver standings.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Steve Grissom and team owner Larry Hedrick have agreed to split.
David Green will drive the No. 41 Chevrolet today. ... Mike Skinner
has improved 10 places to 25th in the points standings. ... Dale
Earnhardt spoke at Martinsville High School earlier this week,
leaving them with this message: ``I encourage all of you to stay in
school and continue your education beyond high school. I regret to
this day not finishing school.''
</P>
<P>
   BUSCH
</P>
<P>
   Big dividends
</P>
<P>
   Elton Sawyer's late-season charge to fourth in the points race
has brought dividends. Akins-Sutton Motorsports will operate a
two-car team with former rookie of the year Glenn Allen working
with Sawyer, beginning with the season-opening race at Daytona.
Sawyer's team will remain intact with crew chief Eddie Pardue.
Allen will have a new crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great. More is going to be better,'' said Sawyer, who
has been driving for his current team since it was formed in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly
</P>
<P>
   The Busch series will resume next week at Charlotte for the All
Pro Bumper To Bumper 300. ... Lysol will end its five-year
sponsorship of Hensley Racing at the end of the season. Casey
Atwood replaces Tracy Leslie as the driver until then. ... Jay Guy
has replaced Bobby Guilbranson as crew chief for Hermie Stadler and
DeWalt Tools. ... Stat of the week: Matt Kenseth, Randy LaJoie and
Buckshot Jones are the only Busch drivers who have been in the top
10 every week since the Daytona season opener. ... Dale Earnhardt
Jr. leads in six of seven statistical categories.
</P>
<P>
   CRAFTSMAN TRUCK
</P>
<P>
   Chasing Sprague
</P>
<P>
   Jack Sprague's fourth-place payoff of $20,450 in last week's Ram
Tough 200 makes the Michigan native the first driver to win more
than $2 million in the Craftsman Truck series. Going into the NAPA
250 at Martinsville, his total earnings were $2,001,588. And he
could have company soon. Ron Hornaday went into Saturday's race
only $39,203 behind Sprague.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Liberty Racing has released its driver, Cintas rookie Wayne
Anderson, replacing him with Bryan Reffner. Team owner Jim Herrick
says several drivers will get a look-see before a permanent
replacement is named for the 1999 season. ... Three trucks were
impounded by NASCAR after the Ram 200 and transported to the wind
tunnel in Marietta, where ongoing aerodynamic evaluation was to be
held. Trucks selected were those of Jimmy Hensley, Hornaday and Tom
Hubert. ... Greg Biffle and Andy Houston remained 1-2 in Rookie of
the Year race going to Martinsville.

MCGWIRE STANDS ALONE, FOR THE MOMENT  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ While some fans held hands and closed their eyes
like participants in a seance, and others gnawed straws to tatters,
Mark McGwire stepped into the batter's box at Busch Stadium
Saturday as if it were an isolation booth.
</P>
<P>
   Oblivious to the wrecked nerves around him, cut off from a
nation engrossed by every swing of his rapturous home-run race with
the Chicago Cubs' Sammy Sosa, McGwire coolly delivered his 67th
home run of the season in the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   And in a surreal encore, McGwire sliced through the pressure
again 90 minutes later for his 68th home run.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire forcefully separated himself from a tie with Sosa, who
remained at 66 after failing to homer in Houston Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Peering through his contact lenses, McGwire tends to lose sight
of his home runs. But once he saw the masses lunge toward each ball
_ one that went 403 feet to left, and one that skyrocketed 435 feet
to center _ McGwire shook his fist.
</P>
<P>
   The lead in the race for home-run immortality was his and his
alone _ at least for now. With just one day remaining in the
regular season, barring a wild-card playoff involving the Cubs, the
redhead with a body as solid as a silo distanced himself from his
good friend Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously this feels nice, but I've got one more day and so
does he,'' McGwire said after the Cardinals lost, 7-6, to the Expos
despite his three runs batted in. ``I think he's got bigger things
on his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The National League wild card is at stake for the Cubs. If the
Cubs are in a tie for that final playoff position after Sunday's
games, Sosa would play one additional game that would count in his
regular season statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing I can do about that,'' McGwire said. ``I'll be
home on the beach.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire cannot wait to dip his toes in the Pacific. Although he
will hold on to this precious season like a loved one, he is
understandably drained. That was visible as McGwire sat before a
table of microphones after the game, and discussed the strain he
and Sosa have had to endure this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure has been unbelievable,'' McGwire said. ``I've yet
to tap into what this season has really been like. I've had to
concentrate harder than I've ever had to concentrate before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people understand how difficult it is to do what
Sammy and I have done. Once we both went to 62, everyone wanted
more. Then it was like, `Well, they've gone two or three days
without a home run. What's wrong with them?'''
</P>
<P>
   The Montreal pitching staff can attest to the fact that there's
nothing amiss with McGwire. He put away his ninth two-homer game of
the season by crushing a first-pitch fastball by Dustin Hermanson
in the fourth inning, and a 1-1 sinker by reliever Kirk Bullinger
in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a good pitch to most human beings,'' Bullinger said.
``But that's why he's a superstar.''
</P>
<P>
   A reluctant one, though. McGwire seemed almost embarrassed when
a horde of fans _ resembling rock-star groupies _ hung over a
railing just above the room where their beloved slugger was
talking. They cried out, ``I love you, Mark,'' and ``Don't let it
end.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday it will end, at least for McGwire. But he has not let
the curtain fall on this season without a rousing finale. It took
McGwire less than 24 hours to one-up and then two-up Sosa. After
being tied at 65 for two days this past week, Sosa hit his 66th on
Friday night, a home run that was followed 45 minutes later by
McGwire's 66th. The synchronized swings were mind-boggling, ``with
no way to explain it,'' McGwire said.
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, beneath a cap with a cartoon frog on it, McGwire
just raised his eyebrows and smiled a smile of disbelief. It is the
modesty and down-to-earth nature of both McGwire and Sosa that has
allowed the country to enjoy this unforgettable season with them.
So many people like both men so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you can't go wrong, can you?'' McGwire said. ``I just
want everyone to have fun this weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   And so they have. Horns honked, and people cheered in the
streets long after Saturday's game was over. For now, their
resident icon's place in history seems safe with his total at 68,
but they have seen Sosa deliver multiple home runs himself. One
more game remains for McGwire and Sosa, with few believing this
race is over just yet.
</P>
<P>
   That looming unease has created an unsettling thought for some
St. Louis fans: What if it ends and all McGwire has is the video of
him breaking Roger Maris' record, the glorious memories of a
special season, and the '62 Corvette given to him by the team? What
if the history books are engraved with Sosa's name, leaving McGwire
as the celebrated footnote?
</P>
<P>
   Just the thought of it makes Tony La Russa reach for an antacid.
There is no hidden agenda for La Russa, the Cardinals' manager. He
is a homer about homers, and has been brazenly honest about his
feelings regarding McGwire's pursuit of the home-run title: the
most glamorous record in baseball should belong to McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always scary when you want something so bad,'' La Russa
said. ``Because it just means that if it doesn't happen, you get
really disappointed. And I think there's a certain amount of
justice to Mark being the home run king and Sammy being the m.v.p.
Sammy's got enough. But this game is about the lack of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   These kind of visceral reactions have been common as this
home-run chase comes to an end, because each player means so much
to those who know them personally. The swirl around McGwire and
Sosa has not affected either man's focus. As always, McGwire is the
one person who has kept his composure and hung tight to perspective
as the tension has built around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Sammy and I have done, whoever is on top, nobody should
be disappointed,'' McGwire said. ``How can you walk away
disappointed if you walk away one below? You can't. It's
impossible.''

PURPLE HEART WILL SOOTHE A VIETNAM VET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW SCHOFIELD  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The ceremony may be 28 years late, but at
noon Saturday the United States officially recognized Norman Humes'
sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   The 49-year-old Kansas City man received a Purple Heart medal at
the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. He earned the honor because shrapnel
from a mortar tore into his leg in 1970 during combat.
</P>
<P>
   But, as is the case with so much from the Vietnam War, the story
of Humes' medal isn't a simple one, and the happy ending is tinged
with bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   It's a story that began on a crisp morning in December 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Humes was one of a group of soldiers out trying to shore up
American bunkers with timber along a hill in the demilitarized zone
called Alpha 4.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers thinking more about the need to get the bunkers
patched up before the next attack than when that attack might come.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had been pretty quiet that morning,'' he said. But the
morning silence was soon broken.
</P>
<P>
   First he heard ``the `thwump, thwump, thwump' of the mortars
being dropped into the tubes.'' He knew enemy mortars would soon
begin exploding all around him.
</P>
<P>
   Humes began screaming for men to head toward the damaged
bunkers. Still, the mortar fire continued, thwump, thwump, 18 times
in all.
</P>
<P>
   Humes was one of three soldiers who didn't made it to a bunker
before the mortars landed. The jagged piece of metal that tore into
the knee came from one that exploded 50 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me,'' he says now, a slight laugh punctuating the
statement, ``I kept on running. I may have been limping pretty
good, but I planned on making it to that bunker.''
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived, a medic bandaged him and said he'd probably get
a Purple Heart. During the rest of his service, others agreed. His
discharge papers listed a Purple Heart as one of his honors. The
medal is awarded to U.S. service personnel for wounds received in
action against an enemy.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't really worry about picking up the medal until 1990,
when he and a friend were picking through a box of old Army
memories. The friend suggested he consider mounting and framing his
awards. That's when Humes realized he didn't have his Purple Heart.
</P>
<P>
   So Humes sent for his medal. He was surprised when a letter came
back informing him he wasn't due one. He started checking around
and got the same answer, again and again.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, in the endless paperwork from his military
service, a clerk had neglected to check a single box.
</P>
<P>
   He asked for the medal. They denied him. He appealed. They
denied. He appealed again. Denied.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote U.S. senators and representatives asking for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I got back were letters telling how committed they were to
veterans' rights,'' he said. ``They owed this to me, but I couldn't
convince anyone....I was really bitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Then one day he ran into Tom Wyrsch, who runs U.S. Rep. Karen
McCarthy's Independence office.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people had ignored him, but I figured he was coming
to us as a last resort, and I owed it to him to look into his
problem,'' Wyrsch said.
</P>
<P>
   He got Humes' military records. It didn't take much study.
</P>
<P>
   ``I highlighted the records in yellow and sent them back to be
investigated,'' he said. ``It wasn't too long before we heard there
didn't need to be any more review. Norman was owed a Purple
Heart.''
</P>
<P>
   So Humes, whose knee still gives him pain occasionally, returned
to the memorial, 42nd Street and Broadway, Saturday for his medal.
He goes there often anyway, to heal and remember those who died and
suffered and to heal some of his own wounds. Sadly, he says, the
fight for his medal is now one of those wounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be glad to get it finally,'' he said Friday. ``But we
were forgotten so often in the past, for so many things. I'm still
bitter that it took so much effort. But I am glad to know that
there are still people around who do care.''

MARCHING BAND TRIES TO SET A RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM BAXTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ It began, like so many marches, before dawn.
</P>
<P>
   Backpacks littered the tarmac, supplies were hastily allocated
and innocent faces _ much too young for the grueling ordeal ahead _
looked to their leaders for order in the confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with a prayer, they tuned their instruments and began to
march into the early morning fog. It was 4:21 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   About 18 hours later, the teens in the Maranatha Academy
marching band met their goal: breaking the world's record for the
longest musical march.
</P>
<P>
   A blowhorn sounded about 10:30 p.m., followed by an announcement
that the group had surpassed the previous world record of 50 miles.
They stopped shortly after 11 p.m., having marched for nearly 19
hours and 52 miles.
</P>
<P>
   The 20 remaining marchers from an original cast of 78 were
greeted with a mixture of applause, flashing cameras and waiting
arms as they crossed the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm exhausted and excited,'' said Melissa Bridges, who carried
her school's banner. ``And I _ I can't feel my legs.''
</P>
<P>
   The students had trained for months for the march, completing
22- and 33-mile practice hikes earlier in the year, but Friday
still held a few surprises, including unexpected cloudbursts in the
morning and a deep, muggy heat as the day stretched on.
</P>
<P>
   By 10 a.m. the medics in the first-aid tent had helped the first
few troupers who just couldn't take another step.
</P>
<P>
   The band played on.
</P>
<P>
   Hour after hour they slogged along a three-mile route around the
Great Mall of the Great Plains in Olathe, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine what walking 50 miles is like?'' parent Ed
Hamil said. ``I walked around with them once and I was beat.''
</P>
<P>
   The students didn't carry sheet music, so a short repertoire of
about a half-dozen songs had been memorized, including ``Hot
Shot,'' ``Energize!'' and ``Trailblazer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll be groaners the rest of the year,'' band director
Steve Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   For a while during thunderstorms Friday morning, students
marched inside the mall, but when the weather cleared, they were
back in the traffic loops circling the center.
</P>
<P>
   By 4 p.m., heat and injuries had decimated the squad, which had
shrunk from 78 students at the beginning to 27.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen students had to complete the march to set a new record.
</P>
<P>
   The bells students had carried in the morning to break the
monotony were long gone. Students complained the bells were banging
against them and bruising their legs.
</P>
<P>
   The wounded gathered around the first-aid tent, offering support
for the still-walking wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Becky Gabbert, a junior, gave up when swelling in her ankles
became so bad she couldn't go on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still had all the energy in the world,'' she said. ``I
wanted to cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, like sophomore Chris Gharst, just had bad luck. Chris
said he was holding up well until he stepped in a pothole and
twisted his leg.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 27, sunburnt and sweaty, still had 20 miles to go
as they struggled in the late-afternoon heat. Olathe had a high of
88 degrees Friday afternoon. The heat index reached 97.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, the band played on.
</P>
<P>
   The record was held by a Pennsylvania high school that marched
50.1 miles in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Maranatha band members had spent months collecting pledges,
hoping to raise $400,000. March organizers said a final pledge
count probably won't be made for a week or two, because pledges are
expected to continue.
</P>
<P>
   Maranatha Academy is a Christian school with campuses in Shawnee
and Kansas City, Kan. The band members were from the Shawnee
campus, and the money would go for new uniforms to replace the
outfits that had been purchased used 18 years ago, for larger band
facilities and for a trip to Washington for the July 4 celebrations
in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, the band director, had broken the record once before he
joined Maranatha seven years ago. In 1988, a Caney, Kan., marching
band he directed logged more than 37 miles and was noted in the
1990 edition of The Guinness Book of Records.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon made a few concessions Friday, dispensing with bass drums
and making other changes to ease the students' load, but Guinness
set most of the rules for the march:
</P>
<P>
   At least 10 students must be playing music throughout the march.
</P>
<P>
   Documentation through logs, mileage sheets, videotape and
testimonial letters must be kept.
</P>
<P>
   Marchers may take one five-minute break for every 60 minutes of
marching and playing.
</P>
<P>
   By 9:30 p.m., the number of marchers had dwindled to 20. They
marched under a half-moon, with cooler temperatures much welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the one time I get to yell,'' said Kelli Jackson, a
trumpet player. She dropped out after 28 miles when her ankles
swelled.
</P>
<P>
   Kelli, 12, cheered along with her father, Warren Jackson, a
doctor who helped give first aid to weary marchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're running on pure adrenalin,'' he said. ``They're going
to have lots of blisters after this.''
</P>
<P>
   One marcher, 13-year-old Philip Bailey, had to be pulled out of
line because his legs kept giving out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to leave,'' said Philip, leaning on a friend.
``I have really, really tired legs.''

INFANT BODY FOUND ON CANAL BANK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD RUELAS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
PHOENIX _ Police are searching for the woman who gave birth to a
baby girl, stuffed her in a plastic bag and left her to die on the
rocky banks of a canal.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A man walking his dog found the infant's body, umbilical cord
attached, amid garbage and broken beer bottles near the muddy water
of the Highline Canal, south of Central Avenue and Baseline Road in
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The plastic bag that held her had been flapping open in the
wind. The body lay inside the bag on the rocky sand on the south
side of the canal. Sounds of passing cars drowned out the sound of
the west-running water.
</P>
<P>
   Police believe the baby was born late Friday or early Saturday.
They are investigating whether the baby was born dead, was killed,
or died after her mother left her in the plastic bag.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Officers spent the day talking with neighbors with homes near
the canal, but came no closer to finding the mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anybody around here who's pregnant,'' said Ruben
Lopez, 19, working on his car about 50 yards north of where the
infant was found.
</P>
<P>
   The canal is easily accessible from a neighborhood to the south,
and from a large apartment complex and neighborhood to the north.
</P>
<P>
   Police don't know if the mother walked or drove to the spot
where she left her baby.
</P>
<P>
   This is the fourth baby abandoned in Phoenix this year. She is
the first to die.
</P>
<P>
   The other three were given names by hospital nurses and placed
in the custody of Child Protectives Services or foster care.
</P>
<P>
   Baby Brandi was found in June, wrapped in a blanket under a tree
along the 7200 block of Indian School Road.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Baby Rachael was found in a trash container near
15th Avenue and Taylor Street.
</P>
<P>
   Also in November, Baby Jasmine, who was 2 or 3 days old, was
found inside a cardboard box outside a child-care center near 35th
and Dunlap avenues. &QL;

 U.S. `poor' pretty cozy, analyst says  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ The good news this week was that the percentage of
poor Americans declined again last year, continuing a trend that
brought government's poverty and income numbers to their best
levels in almost a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The better news is that the situation for those on the lower
rungs of the ladder is probably better than the reported data
indicate.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rector, senior policy analyst for welfare and poverty
issues at the Heritage Foundation, says the Census Bureau's annual
poverty report is inaccurate because it understates real incomes.
</P>
<P>
   In an analysis in /{The Wall Street Journal/} Rector argued his
case by comparing Census Bureau figures with the Commerce
Department's National Income and Product Accounts data. Rector said
Commerce Department accounting for 1996 shows aggregate national
personal income at $6.8 trillion, which included personal payment
of Social Security taxes. The Census Bureau's official definition
of income, however, showed the total at only $4.8 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Rector contends the Census Bureau missed $2 trillion in income,
which equates to about $20,000 for each household. While he
concedes that much of the ``missing income'' belongs to society's
middle and upper strata, ``a large slice is received by low-income
families as well.'' What's missing most significantly from the
poverty statistics, he says, is $500 billion in government
assistance to low-income and elderly households.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to what the yearly poverty report implies, Rector says,
most Americans defined as poor are generally ``better housed and
better fed and own more personal property than average Americans
throughout much of this century.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the numbers he uses to make his point are worth noting.
More than 40 percent of all poor households own their homes and
about three-quarters of a million of these households own homes
valued at more than $150,000. The average home has three bedrooms,
1 bathrooms, a garage and patio. The average poor American has a
third more living space than the average Japanese person and four
times as much as the average Russian.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of 10 officially poor households own cars and nearly three
in 10 own two cars. Nearly all have color television sets and half
have two color TVs. Three-quarters have video cassette recorders,
two-thirds have air-conditioning and microwave ovens, and half have
stereos.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is to suggest that life at the low end of the food
chain is beer and skittles for all, but rather to put things in
perspective. The very term ``poverty report'' conjures up images of
more than 35 million Americans living a life of struggle and
degradation.
</P>
<P>
   As this analysis emphasizes, however, everything is relative. A
poor person in America, for instance, would be the envy of a poor
person in Bangladesh. For that matter, many Americans officially
defined as poor today would be considered fairly well off by even
lower-middle-class Americans of 50 or 60 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line of Rector's thesis is that U.S. society is ill
served by official exaggerations of material deprivation. Society
should, he said, be focusing more on the behavioral problems
afflicting low-income Americans. If it did, he claims, it would
raise awareness of how increasing dependence on the modern welfare
state encourages dysfunctional and self-destructive behavior among
many low-income Americans.

MORE DOMINICANS ARE FEARED DEAD AS WATERS RECEDE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
 1STLD-WRITETHRU-NYT  
 (SUBS to update and refine)   By JOSEPH B. TREASTER and RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic _ Four days after Hurricane
Georges clobbered the Dominican Republic with shattering force, and
as help arrives from around the world, this Caribbean country is
still counting its dead.
</P>
<P>
   With 200 confirmed deaths, government officials say they fear
that scores more lives may have been lost as blocks of homes were
splintered and the storm's rains flooded towns and villages in an
arc stretching as far as 100 miles from this capital city of 3
million people.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the flood waters recede, the bodies keep emerging,'' said
Adriano Tejada, the chief spokesman for President Leonel Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Saturday, helicopter rescue teams from the Dominican
military as well as from National Guard units from Puerto Rico
plucked survivors from the rooftops of submerged houses in heavily
flooded areas. Some of the wreckage was also being searched by dogs
specially trained to find bodies. In the capital, bulldozers shoved
broken trees into piles and squads of soldiers loaded debris into
dump trucks.
</P>
<P>
   A 10 p.m. curfew is in effect in the capital and is being
enforced by soldiers armed with rifles.
</P>
<P>
   The gray skies and howling wind of Hurricane Georges gave way
Saturday to the kind of brilliant blue sky flecked with wispy
cotton candy clouds that draws millions of tourists to the
Dominican Republic. But even such a glorious day could not lift the
spirits of many Dominicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dying of thirst,'' said Josefa Osuna, a 73-year-old
woman picking through the wreckage of her home on the east side of
Santo Domingo. ``We've lost everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The government estimates that more than 500,000 homes were
damaged and that more than 500 people were injured. Nearly 300,000
people are living in 700 emergency shelters. Thousands of acres of
sugar cane, coffee and tobacco, the country's main crops, have been
ruined. Clusters of people are camped along some of the main roads,
sharing food and trying to piece together what they can of their
broken homes.
</P>
<P>
   The capital is pocked with damage. Roofs are gone, windows
broken, and huge metal billboards with nothing left but the iron
frames line the roads. But almost magically, many houses and stores
appear to have been virtually untouched. Everywhere, though, trees
and shrubs have been snapped off, shredded and sometimes uprooted.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Ventura, the mayor of Santo Domingo and a popular
merengue singer with a big following among Dominican emigres in the
United States, said it was difficult to put a price on the damage
in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not quantified the damage,'' he said. ``It's
enormous.''
</P>
<P>
   In a flight over one of the most severely battered cities, San
Pedro de Macoris, about 30 miles east of here, clumps of wood and
tin houses looked as if they had been smashed by an angry giant.
Scores of other houses had been turned into what from the air
looked like rows of tiny doll houses with their roofs lifted off.
</P>
<P>
   A huge sugar mill lost all but a few strips of tin from its roof
and at the Tetelo Vargas Stadium, where the Estrellas Orientales
(Oriental Stars) play the nation's favorite pastime, baseball,
racks of spotlights dangled into the bleachers and much of the tin
sun shade was gone.
</P>
<P>
   While rescue teams were trying to reach people in outlying
areas, the streets of the capital were jammed Saturday with cars
and trucks snaking past downed power lines, trees and heaps of
roofing and rubble.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first day that people have really been able to
move,'' said Leonardo Luzon, 44, whose house lost its roof and an
outside wall. ``Now people are out looking for building supplies
and food.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the country of eight million people has been without
electricity since the hurricane hit on Tuesday, and with no power
to operate pumps, drinking water has been in short supply. At least
12 men, women and teen-agers were lined up with plastic jugs and
pails at a water hose at one house on the edge of the capital at
midday. Others made their way through the wreckage balancing
buckets of water on their heads.
</P>
<P>
   The disaster stirred human misery and cruelty. Julio Romero, a
handyman whose tiny home on the outskirts of Santo Domingo was
destroyed, had in recent days collected a pile of lumber and cinder
blocks to begin rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
   But the other night, as he slept with neighbors who put him up,
thieves made off with the material he had collected.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are evil, but they are clever,'' Romero said. ``They prey
on those of us who are suffering, and that's how they survive.''
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor, Dolores Santos, echoed those thoughts as she
surveyed the heap of wood beams, glass, tables and chairs that was
once her home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thieves have taken everything,'' she said screaming. ``They
took TV's, wood, whatever worthwhile that was left. How can people
do this to each other?''
</P>
<P>
   Mothers and children wandered the edges of the capital like
nomads.
</P>
<P>
   Veronica Suna led her 5-year-old son by the hand as they walked
over to survey the damage to their four-room home. Almost in tears,
she looked at the child, who was barefoot and wearing only blue
shorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing left,'' she said. ``Look at my child. How will
I take care of him?''
</P>
<P>
   At Las Americas International Airport here Saturday morning, an
American Airlines passenger jet from Miami had just unloaded a
cargo of food, gasoline-powered generators, lumber and disposable
diapers as another big jet with relief supplies was landing from
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the communications equipment at the airport was knocked
out by the storm, keeping the runways closed until Friday when
jetliners arrived from Panama and Venezuela. Four small
propeller-driven commuter planes flew in with passengers from
nearby Puerto Rico. Saturday morning, several small charter planes
arrived with journalists from Miami and Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of vacationers hunkered down in hotels in the
Dominican Republic as the hurricane ripped through. They were
particularly relieved that the airport had reopened and some of
them were beginning to leave for home Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   At the airport the storm had tossed two big planes together like
broken toys. It also smashed windows at the terminal and flattened
a forest flanking the airfield.
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday morning, the airport was beginning to hum again. In
the main passenger arrivals terminal, broken ceiling tiles still
littered the polished terrazzo floor. But immigration officials
were quietly processing the papers of the new arrivals.
</P>
<P>
   In Haiti, the death toll from Hurricane Georges has increased to
94 as about 60 other people are missing and feared dead, the
interior ministry said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti, which shares the island of Hispaniola with the Dominican
Republic, has been afflicted with extensive flooding, particularly
in the central plateau and the Artibonite Valley, after almost
every river in the country overflowed, officials said. The
hurricane has also left more than 100,000 homeless and seriously
injured dozens as it destroyed at least 6,000 homes and many acres
of crops.

ST. NEWT CASTS THE FIRST STONE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, some ol' boys was gathered around the rock pile back
in Washington, D.C., when a honkin' big chunk a nastiness went
flying over everybody and whacked Billy Boy Clinton upside his
head.
</P>
<P>
   The craggy stone of an insult was hurled by none other than Newt
Gingrich, speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, who upped
and called the president a ``misogynist.''
</P>
<P>
   With all the smut getting printed in the papers lately, some
folks might figure ``misogyny'' has something to do with spreading
Crisco on your back and getting a rubdown. But, no.
</P>
<P>
   Pure and simple, it means ``woman-hater.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Gingrich called Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of name-calling going on lately, mostly by men who
don't remember the lessons they learned on the schoolyard. For
instance, when some loudmouth starts putting you down, you say,
``I'm rubber and you're glue, whatever you say bounces off me and
sticks on you.''
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, congressional candidate Newt Gingrich sent
out a flyer about his female Democratic opponent. In it, the
Gingrich camp said if the voters elected a woman, she would have to
break up her family in order to move to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Still, according to Newt, Clinton's the woman-hater. &QL; 
BAD TIMING
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after getting elected to Congress on a platform of
``family values,'' Gingrich decided to divorce his wife of many
years, Jackie, with whom he'd had two daughters. This happened
while Jackie was going through treatment for cancer.
</P>
<P>
   She later told a reporter about a particularly revealing
incident during that time.
</P>
<P>
   ``By September, I went into the hospital for my third surgery,''
she said. ``The two girls came to see me and said, `Daddy is
downstairs. Could he come up?' When he got there, he wanted to
discuss the terms of the divorce while I was recovering from my
surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, it's Clinton who hates women.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe Clinton does.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't treat his wife very well. He uses women and lies
about it. And, according to his grand jury testimony, he believes
in a strange and narrow definition of sex.
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, Newt and Bill apparently consult the same
dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   The September 1995 issue of ``Vanity Fair'' magazine featured a
long profile of Gingrich, written by Gail Sheehy. This was a long
time before anyone ever heard of Monica Lewinsky. &QL; 
SOMETHING IN COMMON
</P>
<P>
   In the article, several former associates discussed Gingrich's
extracurricular behavior with the ladies. One woman, Anne Manning,
claimed to be a mistress. She said Gingrich preferred to engage in
the same type of physical intimacy most recently associated with
Clinton and the intern. Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Gingrich) prefers that modus operandi,'' Manning said in
1995, ``because then he can say, `I never slept with her.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds familiar, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   What we've got with Newt and Bill, it turns out, is six of one
and half dozen of the Bubba.
</P>
<P>
   Articles published over the years also have reported that
Gingrich's former wife had to go to court to collect child support
and alimony payments.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gingrich says Clinton is the woman-hater.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's U.S. Sen. John McCain hasn't said much about Clinton.
It's been reported many times that McCain's own first marriage
ended in part because he fooled around. He doesn't like to talk
about it. He shouldn't have to.
</P>
<P>
   No one should.
</P>
<P>
   They will, however, as long as someone like Gingrich keeps
stoking the fire on the impeachment express and calling other
people misogynists.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, in the ``Vanity Fair'' article, Gingrich's second
wife, Marianne, says she once bought her husband a book to help him
understand the kind of person he was. It's ``Men Who Hate Women &AMP;
the Women Who Love Them.'' &QL;

BOB A WINNER WITH DIAMONDBACKS' FANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bank One Ballpark is one of the largest buildings in Arizona,
but it spent the past six months under a microscope.
</P>
<P>
   During the Diamondbacks' inaugural season, every creak and
squeak coming from the mammoth ballpark was analyzed, dissected and
discussed. From the pool to the roof to the air conditioning to the
grass, everybody wanted to know: What about BOB?
</P>
<P>
   ``The building has operated probably as well as we ever could
have hoped,'' said Roger Brendecke, an administrator for the
Maricopa County Stadium District. ``We did not have any major roof
problems. We didn't have anything other than . . . problems
normally associated with commissioning a new building.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing has gone smoother and had less problems than some
single-family homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the $355 million ballpark was not without its share of
troubles. The grass never quite took hold. The air conditioning
needed some tweaking, as did the giant, retractable roof. And St.
Louis slugger Mark McGwire hit a rocket that took a chunk out of
the electronic scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Diamondbacks play their last game today, fans say
they're satisfied with BOB's first season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The park itself is fantastic,'' said Mike Nelson, 36, of
Chandler, who attended about 40 games. ``No matter where you sit,
even in the upper deck, you've got a good view.''
</P>
<P>
   And Nelson said he's happy how the expansion Diamondbacks
delivered on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am ecstatic,'' Nelson said. ``They are not going to have a
100-loss season. They guaranteed that (Tuesday) night. That was all
I hoped for.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Deems, a 66-year-old season-ticket holder from Scottsdale,
said he likes BOB's cozy atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have spring training tickets to the Cubs, and the (BOB)
outfield seems closer,'' Deems said. ``Even though it's a long ways
out, it just seems compact.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the team's play, Deems said he was pleasantly surprised
by All-Star outfielder Devon White, and disappointed in
third-baseman Matt Williams and shortstop Jay Bell, two high-priced
free agents who had subpar years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to seeing some improvement in the team,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like most fans, Deems said he enjoys the games more when the
roof is open, but he understands why it has to be closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's over 100 degrees outside, I don't think it's ever
going to be open,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For BOB, the closest thing to a crisis came during the intense
heat of July, when the air-conditioning system couldn't seem to
cool the upper deck.
</P>
<P>
   Ballpark officials investigated and discovered large gaps around
the giant outfield doors, which have advertising on the inside and
murals on the outside. After closing the gaps with clear plastic,
they also redirected air around the upper deck, BOB General Manager
Bob Machen said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also experimented with closing the roof at different
times to make sure the stadium is cool at game time. They settled
on 3{ hours before game time.
</P>
<P>
   In June, after McGwire cracked the scoreboard with a batting
practice fly ball, some reports placed the damage at $20,000.
Machen said the real figure was around $500. They didn't fix it
right away, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Texas outfielder) Juan Gonzalez was coming, and we waited to
see if he was going to do any of those things,'' Machen said.
</P>
<P>
   While flying balls were a problem, so were flying bats. In
separate games, two fans were whacked by bats that slipped out of
batters' hands. One received 50 stitches. In the other case, the
bat whizzed right over the head of Jerry Colangelo, the
Diamondbacks managing gen eral partner, and then hit a fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is an inherent problem when you go to a baseball game,''
Machen said, adding, ``You have to watch what's going on on the
field, every pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   For most fans, criticism came in two areas: concessions and
parking, though the game-day gridlock some predicted for downtown
never came true. Still, some said the food was too expensive and
too fatty, and others said paying $10 to park near the stadium is
just too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not impressed (with the food),'' said Pam Wilson, a
season-ticket holder from Mesa. ``I don't think it's anything
special. I don't normally eat at the ballpark because I think it's
expensive and I'm not a hotdog and hamburger person, per se.''
</P>
<P>
   In a public relations move, the team backed away from a
no-cooler policy before the season started. That allowed fans to
bring in their own food and avoid paying ballpark prices.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't stop BOB's vendor, Restaura, from selling 72 miles
of hot dogs and 20 tons of chicken tenders. They also peddled
25,000 pounds of nacho chips, 2,500 gallons of cheese and 32.5
million ounces of soda.
</P>
<P>
   They sold 160,000 orders of the $5 chicken tenders and fries _
the second-most popular item behind hot dogs, and widely considered
to be the best deal at BOB.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, fans liked BOB's ushers, though they were
charged with enforcing some unpopular rules.
</P>
<P>
   Some fans were rankled when they weren't allowed to move down
into the expensive, field-level seats that opened up in the late
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work very hard to make sure they don't do that,'' Machen
said. ``Because I paid $50 for my seat, I don't want somebody
coming down sitting there who paid $9 for their seat.''
</P>
<P>
   Ushers also kept people from standing along the outfield
concourse and watching the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people that are sitting in front of those people who are
walking, they don't want people breathing down their necks,''
Machen said. ``So that's why (the ushers) are doing it.''

 EGYPT TREASURES BOW IN PHOENIX  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Six Germans and a crew of workers from the Phoenix Art Museum
have plopped down three tons of red granite on the floor of the
Cummings Great Hall.
</P>
<P>
   They have jimmied it into place against a temporary wall built
for the `` Splendors of Ancient Egypt'' show that opens Oct. 4.
</P>
<P>
   It is the sarcophagus of Kai-em-nofret. It is 4,480 years old
and it hangs a few inches in the air, suspended on both ends by the
steel tongues of pallet jacks, those hand-operated half-forklifts
used to place heavy objects in precise locations.
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps a little late to ask the question, but one of the
Germans, from the museum that owns the sarcophagus, asks almost
distractedly in an accent, ``Is there a right side to this?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes, there is. There is an inscription on one side of the
giant stone box, and of course, it is the side up against the wall.
It reads, simply _ if you can say that about hieroglyphic writing _
``The Chamberlain Kai-em-nofret.''
</P>
<P>
   So, they pump the pallet jacks up again, and like piano movers
in an apartment hallway, they try to turn the whole thing around
without dinging up the freshly painted new walls, or the
not-so-fresh speckled granite of the box.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the few miscues as the giant exhibit is being
installed. With more than 200 artifacts from ancient Egypt, the
show is larger and more inclusive than the famous ``Treasures of
Tutankhamen'' show that ushered in the era of museum blockbuster
shows in the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The path that brought Kai-em-nofret's intended final resting
place to Phoenix began in 1995, when the museum that owns it, the
Roemer and Pelizaeus Museum of Hildesheim, Germany, decided it
needed to renovate and expand its facilities.
</P>
<P>
   That museum was founded in 1870. But dust collects, paint peels
and leaky plumbing stains ceilings and floors, so, when they needed
to renovate the old place, they thought, well, we can either put
all our collection in storage while we work, or we can send it
around the world to be seen elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Which they did. Its American tour has taken it to St.
Petersburg, Fla.; Houston; Detroit; and Portland, Ore., before
coming to Phoenix. And by art museum standards, the Egypt show
happened in a flash.
</P>
<P>
   Museum Director Jim Ballinger saw the show in Houston in the
spring of 1997, at the Museum of Fine Arts there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had goose bumps when I saw it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, in November, Ballinger flew to Germany for
an official contract-signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   It's a monster show, covering three-fifths of the time
civilization has existed on the planet. The oldest pieces, from the
time of the Pyramids, are roughly 5,000 years old; the most recent
are from the time of the Roman Empire. Three thousand years are
covered, with sculpture, painting, pottery, jewelry and a mummy.
</P>
<P>
   So much stuff, in fact, that it took two Allied Van Lines
semitrailers and six Germans, to say nothing of a van-line
specialist, the normal staff of the museum, and that forklift.
</P>
<P>
   And those were just the final steps. In the beginning, money had
to be raised, plans had to be made. The museum prefers not to say
how much the exhibit will cost, but Ballinger did say that it is
``higher than the entire operating budget of the museum 10 years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the museum's budget was approximately $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   US West immediately agreed to be the major corporate sponsor for
the show. The museum got additional support from the Flinn
Foundation, the Kemper and Ethel Marley Foundation, Bashas',
Dillard's and Bank of America. But even with money and corporate
sponsorship, there was still the problem of where to put the show.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, the exhibit ate up 20,000 square feet; in Portland,
it took 18,000.
</P>
<P>
   The standard space for changing shows at the Phoenix Art Museum
was only 9,100 feet. And the museum was already backed up with its
regularly scheduled shows _ the Cowboy Artists of America show in
October and `` Copper as Canvas'' show in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also a long show, up for 5{ months, much longer than most
museum shows, '' Ballinger said.
</P>
<P>
   So he and the museum staff had to decide where it could put the
Egyptian exhibit. They decided on the Cummings Great Hall, which is
normally a meeting and banquet hall and was not designed to display
art. It could be combined, however, with its surrounding galleries
to add up to 18,000 square feet. But making it happen would take a
major commitment of time and money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it would be a big undertaking,'' Ballinger said, ``and
we cannot pretend to have a staff curator with the credentials in
Egyptology to move the show along, so we knew we had to have
someone on staff to marshal this thing along.''
</P>
<P>
   So they hired Jim Rhone, retired special projects manager for
Phoenix, as Egypt project manager, and University of Arizona
Egyptologist Richard Wilkinson as a consultant. But that still left
them without an on-site curator _ the person who normally decides
what goes where in a show, and how the pieces are best displayed.
</P>
<P>
   That work fell to Exhibit Designer David Restad and Kathryn
Blake, associate curator for education. Brought into the process in
October 1997, Restad and Blake had a year to plan and execute the
exhibition, in addition to their regular jobs at the museum.
</P>
<P>
   They began with a visit to the Detroit exhibit in October to see
what they were dealing with. They discovered a huge show spread out
over an even huger space.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not like anything we've experienced before,'' Restad
said. `` I ran into something like writer's block. I can't just
pull it out of a hat. It's a new space where I've never worked
before _ and I was just getting a handle on the Steele Gallery.''
</P>
<P>
   The Steele Gallery is the changing exhibit space in the enlarged
portion of the museum.
</P>
<P>
   But Restad let things percolate for a while. He also visited the
Portland Art Museum in April when the show went there. He was
accompanied by Rhone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave David a second chance to see the exhibit in a
different venue and gave me a chance to talk with a number of
people in Portland with their experience on the staff side, with
marketing people, the volunteer coordinator and operations
director,'' Rhone said.
</P>
<P>
   When they returned, Restad began cutting out little squares of
cardboard representing the separate exhibit pieces and moving them
around on a graph-paper floor plan, trying to figure out how best
to lay out the show. He had to take into account the number of
pieces in the show, their chronological organization and just how
many stops there would be on the audiotape tour that museum
visitors would be given.
</P>
<P>
   He also had to plan where to build walls in the Great Hall to
subdivide it into smaller, more intimate galleries. He wound up
making a foamcore model of the exhibit space and using small wooden
blocks to represent the exhibit cases. Then, when he had the show
planned out in general, he went full-scale, putting tape and
cardboard squares down on the floor of the Great Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a jigsaw puzzle,'' he said. ``You find the right
piece and it takes you to the next piece and once that gets going,
it turns into a pinball game and you shoot people this way and then
over that way.''
</P>
<P>
   He also had the museum staff walk through the space to see how
the traffic might flow in real terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, I was getting more comfortable,'' Restad said.
</P>
<P>
   All this was just the physical side of the exhibit, though.
Blake and Rhone had another set of concerns to take care of _
marketing, education, ticketing, security _ all on a grander scale
than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to begin reaching out to the public schools,'' Rhone
said. ``Our education department mailed out a notice to each and
every schoolteacher in the state, so they got in their mailboxes
the information they needed to book their schoolchildren on
tours.''
</P>
<P>
   They have already booked 70,000 students from throughout Arizona
and have a waiting list.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has been a mammoth task,'' Rhone said.
</P>
<P>
   Ticketing was mammoth as well. Rhone soon decided it would be
too much for the museum staff, so they went with Dillard's.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, obviously, since we have added so much extra exhibit
space, that requires more security personnel,'' he said. ``We'll be
open more hours than usual, so the museum finds itself open 61
hours a week.''
</P>
<P>
   So, the museum has added about 24 full-time positions for the
Egypt show, plus an additional 10 security positions. That's not
counting the volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just blown away with the response,'' Rhone said.
``Over 2,000 people called in and volunteered.''
</P>
<P>
   Deadlines came sooner than a museum staff is accustomed to. For
most shows, even the largest, full installation is possible in
about six weeks. But this had to be completely ready before the
trucks arrived from Portland with the show pieces. And opening date
was Oct. 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided we needed to close the Cummings Great Hall July
6,'' Rhone said.
</P>
<P>
   The walls were up by July 10; the cases were in place by Aug.
15. And when the trucks showed up on Aug. 26, the hall was ready to
go.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, the museum's own preparators install the objects into
their places, but for this show came a crew of six specialists from
Germany. Two women were curators from the Pelizaeus Museum and four
men were employees of Hasenkamp, the German company that crates,
couriers and installs shows for museums. They handled the whole
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've done this so many times for so many museums, they know
exactly what it will take,'' Restad said.
</P>
<P>
   Well, except perhaps for that almost-backward sarcophagus. But
he'll never know the difference. &QL;

 EGYPT TREASURES BOW IN PHOENIX  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Six Germans and a crew of workers from the Phoenix Art Museum
have plopped down three tons of red granite on the floor of the
Cummings Great Hall.
</P>
<P>
   They have jimmied it into place against a temporary wall built
for the `` Splendors of Ancient Egypt'' show that opens Oct. 4.
</P>
<P>
   It is the sarcophagus of Kai-em-nofret. It is 4,480 years old
and it hangs a few inches in the air, suspended on both ends by the
steel tongues of pallet jacks, those hand-operated half-forklifts
used to place heavy objects in precise locations.
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps a little late to ask the question, but one of the
Germans, from the museum that owns the sarcophagus, asks almost
distractedly in an accent, ``Is there a right side to this?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes, there is. There is an inscription on one side of the
giant stone box, and of course, it is the side up against the wall.
It reads, simply _ if you can say that about hieroglyphic writing _
``The Chamberlain Kai-em-nofret.''
</P>
<P>
   So, they pump the pallet jacks up again, and like piano movers
in an apartment hallway, they try to turn the whole thing around
without dinging up the freshly painted new walls, or the
not-so-fresh speckled granite of the box.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the few miscues as the giant exhibit is being
installed. With more than 200 artifacts from ancient Egypt, the
show is larger and more inclusive than the famous ``Treasures of
Tutankhamen'' show that ushered in the era of museum blockbuster
shows in the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The path that brought Kai-em-nofret's intended final resting
place to Phoenix began in 1995, when the museum that owns it, the
Roemer and Pelizaeus Museum of Hildesheim, Germany, decided it
needed to renovate and expand its facilities.
</P>
<P>
   That museum was founded in 1870. But dust collects, paint peels
and leaky plumbing stains ceilings and floors, so, when they needed
to renovate the old place, they thought, well, we can either put
all our collection in storage while we work, or we can send it
around the world to be seen elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Which they did. Its American tour has taken it to St.
Petersburg, Fla.; Houston; Detroit; and Portland, Ore., before
coming to Phoenix. And by art museum standards, the Egypt show
happened in a flash.
</P>
<P>
   Museum Director Jim Ballinger saw the show in Houston in the
spring of 1997, at the Museum of Fine Arts there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had goose bumps when I saw it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, in November, Ballinger flew to Germany for
an official contract-signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   It's a monster show, covering three-fifths of the time
civilization has existed on the planet. The oldest pieces, from the
time of the Pyramids, are roughly 5,000 years old; the most recent
are from the time of the Roman Empire. Three thousand years are
covered, with sculpture, painting, pottery, jewelry and a mummy.
</P>
<P>
   So much stuff, in fact, that it took two Allied Van Lines
semitrailers and six Germans, to say nothing of a van-line
specialist, the normal staff of the museum, and that forklift.
</P>
<P>
   And those were just the final steps. In the beginning, money had
to be raised, plans had to be made. The museum prefers not to say
how much the exhibit will cost, but Ballinger did say that it is
``higher than the entire operating budget of the museum 10 years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the museum's budget was approximately $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   US West immediately agreed to be the major corporate sponsor for
the show. The museum got additional support from the Flinn
Foundation, the Kemper and Ethel Marley Foundation, Bashas',
Dillard's and Bank of America. But even with money and corporate
sponsorship, there was still the problem of where to put the show.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, the exhibit ate up 20,000 square feet; in Portland,
it took 18,000.
</P>
<P>
   The standard space for changing shows at the Phoenix Art Museum
was only 9,100 feet. And the museum was already backed up with its
regularly scheduled shows _ the Cowboy Artists of America show in
October and `` Copper as Canvas'' show in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also a long show, up for 5{ months, much longer than most
museum shows, '' Ballinger said.
</P>
<P>
   So he and the museum staff had to decide where it could put the
Egyptian exhibit. They decided on the Cummings Great Hall, which is
normally a meeting and banquet hall and was not designed to display
art. It could be combined, however, with its surrounding galleries
to add up to 18,000 square feet. But making it happen would take a
major commitment of time and money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it would be a big undertaking,'' Ballinger said, ``and
we cannot pretend to have a staff curator with the credentials in
Egyptology to move the show along, so we knew we had to have
someone on staff to marshal this thing along.''
</P>
<P>
   So they hired Jim Rhone, retired special projects manager for
Phoenix, as Egypt project manager, and University of Arizona
Egyptologist Richard Wilkinson as a consultant. But that still left
them without an on-site curator _ the person who normally decides
what goes where in a show, and how the pieces are best displayed.
</P>
<P>
   That work fell to Exhibit Designer David Restad and Kathryn
Blake, associate curator for education. Brought into the process in
October 1997, Restad and Blake had a year to plan and execute the
exhibition, in addition to their regular jobs at the museum.
</P>
<P>
   They began with a visit to the Detroit exhibit in October to see
what they were dealing with. They discovered a huge show spread out
over an even huger space.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not like anything we've experienced before,'' Restad
said. `` I ran into something like writer's block. I can't just
pull it out of a hat. It's a new space where I've never worked
before _ and I was just getting a handle on the Steele Gallery.''
</P>
<P>
   The Steele Gallery is the changing exhibit space in the enlarged
portion of the museum.
</P>
<P>
   But Restad let things percolate for a while. He also visited the
Portland Art Museum in April when the show went there. He was
accompanied by Rhone.

   ``It gave David a second chance to see the exhibit in a

director,'' Rhone said.
