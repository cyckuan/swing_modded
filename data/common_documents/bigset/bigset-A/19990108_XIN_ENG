<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate Thursday
started impeachment trial against President Bill Clinton in
connection with his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, a White
House intern.
</P>
<P>
In a solemn prelude to the first presidential impeachment trial
in 131 years, prosecutors of the House of Representatives
delivered to the Senate two articles of impeachment accusing
Clinton of perjury and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
The ceremonial opening came amid intense, last-minute

Led by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, the 13

</P>
<P>
Hyde read the two articles of impeachment against Clinton,
passed by the House just three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
With House prosecutors pressing Senate leaders to allow
testimony from witnesses such as Monica Lewinsky, there were
increasing indications that a trial of some weeks' duration was in
the offing.

<HEADLINE> EU Does More to Relieve Japanese Crisis: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
done more than its share to help relieve the financial and
economic crises in Japan and Asia, said a senior European
Commission official Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Leon Brittan, vice-president of the commission, the executive
body of the 15-nation EU, told visiting Japanese International
Trade and Industry Minister Kaoru Yosano that the EU had done a
lot in absorbing Japan's exports to accelerate the economic
recovery in both Japan and Asia.
</P>
<P>
Japan's exports to the EU rose 19 percent last year with its
imports from the EU down five percent, said Leon Brittan, adding
that Japanese exports to the United States went up 11 percent at
the same time.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Kaoru Yosano said Tokyo doesn't want to shift i
ts economic difficulties onto someone else and has been working
to boost domestic demands instead.
</P>
<P>
In response to Japan's demand for 50 deregulation measures
being carried out by the EU, the EU required Thursday that about
200 appropriate measures be taken by Japan to stimulate economic
recovery and to improve market access in the country.
</P>
<P>
Both the officials agreed that these measures will play a
vital role in stimulating economic growth and improving market
access. They welcomed the steps taken by the business circles of
the two sides to resolve key issues of mutual concern and to
expand EU-Japan relationship.
</P>
<P>
Brittan and Yosano shared the view that the EU and Japan, as
two of the major economies in the world, shoulder a joint
responsibility to ensure global economic stability and growth.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the sound macroeconomics policy and structural
reforms, the newly-launched single currency will help create
stability in the world financial market and advance international
trade, they stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese minister brushed aside a reported proposal on
freezing the exchange rates between the main currencies, noting
that the rates should reflect basic economic principles and real
financial situation and it isn't advisable to freeze them.
</P>
<P>
"Fluctuation is only natural," he voiced.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM Designate to Submit Cabinet List Friday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister designate
Bulent Ecevit said here Thursday that he hopes to submit the
cabinet list to President Suleyman Demirel Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit, leader of the Democratic Left Party (DSP), made the
remarks at the presidential palace after he was re-assigned by
Demirel to form the 56th government.
</P>
<P>
He said the new cabinet will include ministers from the
Motherland Party (ANAP) led by ousted Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz
and True Path Party (DYP) led by Tansu Ciller.
</P>
<P>
Independent lawmaker and Industry and Trade Minister Yalim
Erez returned his mandate for the government formation to Demirel
Wednesday two days after Ciller provided a sudden support for a
proposal for the minority government led by Ecevit.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit believed that he will not meet difficulties in getting a
vote of confidence from the parliament.
</P>
<P>
On December 21, Ecevit returned his mandate for the government
formation to Demirel as he failed to get enough support in the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit pointed out that the would-be government will stay in
power for a short period of three months as the general elections
are expected to be held on April 18.

<HEADLINE> China Provides Grant to Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NAIROBI, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan and Kenyan Finance Minister Simeon Nyachae Thursday signed
exchange of letters for the Chinese government to provide a grant of about
0.6 million U.S.Dollars to the eastern African country.
</P>
<P>
The grant, worth about 35 million Shillings (0.6 million U.S.
Dollars), " will be used to finance projects to be agreed upon between the
two governments," Nyachae told reporters at the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
 He expressed the appreciation for China's development assistance
to Kenya in the fields such as roads, health, water, sports and
manpower since the two countries set up diplomatic relations 35 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Kenya also expects to benefit from China's great achievements made in

technology and industrialization and the immense trading opportunities
offered by China's large market, said Nyachae, urging Chinese enterprises
to increase investment in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Tang said the donation is "another achievement" in Sino-Kenyan
cooperation on trade.
</P>
<P>
He called for more joint efforts to explore new ways and new forms
to deepen the two countries' economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Tang started his visit to Kenya Wednesday and is scheduled to fly
to Uganda Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is the second stop of his 12-day African tour which include
Egypt, Tanzania and Zambia.

<HEADLINE> Williams, Kournikova into HK Int'l Tennis Semi-finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian teenager sensation
Anna Kournikova and American Serena Williams qualified for the
singles semi-finals after winning their first round matches at the
inaugural Super-Power Challenge Cup women's tennis tournament here
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kournikova, third seed of the three-day exhibition tournament,
beat Chinese ace Li Fang 6-1, 6-4 in 56 minutes while
fourth-seeded Serena Williams downed Thailand's 37th-ranked
Tamarine Tanasugarn 6-2, 6-1 in 50 minutes.
</P>
<P>
With a tricky and flexible game, 17-year-old Kournikova took
the upper hand in the first set, breaking all of Li's four games
while having only one of her own games broken.
</P>
<P>
Li came back strongly after losing the three games in the
second set, winning two games in a row with her serve-and-volley
play and, after two more games lost, leveled the game score at
four-all.
</P>
<P>
But the 17-year-old Russian played a suprisingly controled game
to force her Chinese opponent into many unforced errors and won
two more games to take the match.
</P>
<P>
Kournikova will face second-seeded American Venus Williams,
elder sister of Serena Williams, while Serena Williams will take
on top seed and former world number one Steffi Graf from Germany,
in the semi-finals on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I played very well today and I'm quite satisfied for my first
match of the year," said Kournikova, a Moscow-born part-time
model.
</P>
<P>
She said she would continue to try different kind of play in
the future as she did in the second set in Thursday's match.
</P>
<P>
"I can not change the way of play of others but I can control
my own way of play," she said.
</P>
<P>
Kournikova, whose world ranking had risen from 224th in 1995 to
13th at the end of last year, admitted that she still needed
experience to deal with tough matches and to learn how to build up
strong nerves.
</P>
<P>
Serena Williams had no problems beating Thailand's Asian Games
silver-medalist Tanasugarn, with her superb play. The lob-sided
match saw six double faults from the 37th-ranked Thai and five
Aces by Williams.
</P>
<P>
Graf and Venus Williams had been given semi-final spots due to
byes for them at the first round on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ranked No. 1 in the world for a record length of 377
consecutive weeks, the German ace had long suffered from sustained
injuries, which had brought her ranking down. But she still ranked
ninth at the year-ending world rankings for 1998.
</P>
<P>
Venus Williams, 18, had brought her world ranking from 211st at
early 1997 up to fifth at the year-ending rankings for 1998.
</P>
<P>
In the doubles first round which was also semi-finals on
Thursday, top-seeded duo Li Fang and Serena Williams downed their
opponents Venus Williams and Lin Ning from Hong Kong SAR 7-6
(7-2), 3-6, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
In the final on Saturday, Li and Venus Williams will meet the
winners of another semi-final match on Friday, between Steffi
Graf/Tong Ka Po and Kournikova/Tanasugarn.

<P>
NAIROBI, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
Thursday met the visiting Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan at the
Nakuru State House.

Moi said that the current international situation changes rapidly and
so does the situation in Africa.
</P>
<P>
It is of great importance to Africa that China as a big country stands
side by side with the developing countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
At the turn of the century, Moi said, Kenya and China should have
frequent discussions and dialogs so as to meet the changing situation in
the world.

Tang expressed his admiration to the positive contributions made by
President Moi in promoting the Sino-Kenyan and Sino-African relationship.
</P>

ways and fields in strengthening bilateral economic and trade cooperation
under new circumstances for the benefits of the people of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
 China hopes, through joint efforts with African countries, to develop
the Sino-African relationship featured by long-term stability, friendly and
true cooperation, and common development, he said.
</P>
<P>
 During his stay in Kenya, Tang also met with Kenyan Foreign Minister

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Begins Impeachment Trial Against Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate Thursday
started impeachment trial against President Bill Clinton in
connection with his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, a White
House intern.
</P>
<P>
In a solemn prelude to the first presidential impeachment trial
in 131 years, prosecutors of the House of Representatives
delivered to the Senate two articles of impeachment accusing
Clinton of perjury and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
The ceremonial opening came amid intense, last-minute
bargaining over ground rules.
</P>
<P>
Led by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, the 13
Republicans named as prosecutors for the trial walked silently
across the Capitol -- followed by cameras that broadcast the scene
live to the nation -- to deliver the papers.
</P>
<P>
Hyde read the two articles of impeachment against Clinton,
passed by the House just three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Clinton "has prevented, obstructed and impeded the
administration of justice," the silver-haired Hyde intoned as he
read in a steady voice from the articles to a stilled Senate
chamber. The two articles stem from Clinton's effort to conceal
his affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
When he had finished, Hyde said, "That concludes the exposition
of the articles of impeachment against William Jefferson Clinton.
The managers request that the Senate take order for the trial."
</P>
<P>
Three senators from each party were to leave later in the day
and escort Chief Justice William Rehnquist from the Supreme Court.
Rehnquist was to be given an oath and then administer another oath
to the 100 senators who will serve as jurors.
</P>
<P>
Beyond the public sessions, the House "managers" were
negotiating for the right to summon a number of witnesses, most
notably Lewinsky, whose affair with Clinton triggered the
impeachment investigation, and presidential friend Vernon Jordan.
</P>
<P>
A White House offer not to challenge the grand jury testimony
gathered by prosecutor Kenneth Starr and to allow it as evidence
in the trial was welcomed Thursday by one Republican senator.
</P>
<P>
Outside the Capitol, a long line of tourists formed, hoping to
get a glimpse of the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
The crucial question was whether to allow witnesses, as
demanded by the House but opposed by Senate Democrats.
</P>
<P>
Among Senate Republicans, according to sources who spoke on
condition of anonymity, one proposal was to give each side in the
trial, the House and the White House, three to five days to
present evidence, most likely beginning next week. At the end of
that time, a vote would be permitted to adjourn the trial, or
either side could seek permission to summon witnesses. The Senate
would have to approve each witness to be called by majority vote.
</P>
<P>
Without witnesses, the timetable would place final votes on the
articles in the first week of February. Summoning witnesses to
testify would push the date back.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, Britain Sign Intent on Industrial Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 JOHANNESBURG, January 7 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and Britain Thursday
signed a declaration of intent on industrial cooperation based on South
Africa's defense equipment procurement package.
</P>
<P>
The six-point declaration was signed by visiting British Prime Minister
Tony Blair and South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
The two countries agreed to hold regular meetings between foreign trade
and defense authorities to monitor, report and oversee Britain's counter-
trade commitments to South Africa as a result of military equipment sales
to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Britain, in consultation with the South African side, would send an
official to the South African Department of Trade and Industry to oversee
the counter-trade arrangements.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also agreed to "work together for mutual benefit,
seeking wherever possible to maximize the socio-economic benefits arising
from defense procurement."
</P>
<P>
According to the declaration, the British Department of Trade and
Industry and the Ministry of Defense will enter discussions with the South
African negotiation team to explore coordination of the finance
arrangements for the arms deal between the successful bidders for the
defense equipment contracts from Britain, Germany, Sweden and Italy.
</P>
<P>
South African cabinet in November approved a 30-billion-Rand (5.2-
billion-U.S. Dollar) arms deal and announced preferred suppliers for the
equipment.
</P>
<P>
Britain won contracts for maritime helicopters and trainer jets. Twenty-
eight Gripen fighter jets, jointly made by Sweden's Saab and British
Aerospace, were also included in the package.

PARIS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac

Obuchi, who is the first Japanese prime minister to visit
Europe since 1995, said during a meeting with French entrepreneurs
Thursday, "A three-way cooperation between Japan, Europe and the
United States would enable us to create a stable, developed
international monetary system."
</P>

Chirac said that the euro will help the world maintain a better
balance in the financial system in the process of globalization.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Oil Minister on Oil-for-Food Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has signed 42 oil
contracts since the fifth phase of the U.N. oil-for-food program
started on November 26 last year, said Iraqi Oil Minister Amir
Mohammed Rashid Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Economist weekly, Rashid said 30
contracts have got approval from the U.N. Sanctions Committee.
</P>
<P>
Iraq was put under the U.N. sanctions after its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990, but in 1996 the U.N. hammered out an oil-for-food
program allowing Iraq to export a limited amount of oil to buy
food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
Under the six-month fifth phase, Iraq is allowed to export 5.2
billion U.S. dollars worth of oil.
</P>
<P>
Rashid said the approved contracts have been implemented since
early last month and Iraqi oil were shipped to world market via
Iraq's oil terminal of al-Bakr and the Turkish port of Ceyhan.
</P>
<P>
He added Iraq will market 300 million barrels of crude oil
during the fifth phase.
</P>
<P>
On oil cooperation with Jordan, Rashid said the two countries
will start this week to study Jordan's need for oil in 1999 based
on an agreement signed last year.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, which should be renewed every year, Iraq
provided Jordan with 4.8 million tonnes of crude oil and refined
oil products in 1998 at preferential prices.
</P>
<P>
Rashid said a Jordanian delegation headed by Minister of Energy
Hani Malki will visit Iraq shortly to renew the oil agreement.
</P>
<P>
He also said the construction of the 750-kilometer-long oil
pipeline linking Haditha in northwestern Iraq and the Jordanian
oil refinery of al-Zarqa will start soon.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline, with an investment of 300 million U.S. dollars,
has a transfer capacity of 150,000 barrels per day when going into
operation.
</P>
<P>
As for the Iraqi-Syrian oil pipeline, Rashid said talks to
reopen the pipeline are still underway and part of the oil spare
parts needed for restoration have been secured.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi-Syrian pipeline was closed in 1982 during the
eight-year Iraq-Iran war, in which Syria sided with Iran.
</P>
<P>
In July 1988, Iraq and Syria agreed to reopen the pipeline
which carries crude oil from the Iraqi northern city of Kirkuk to
the export terminal in the Syrian port city of Banias on the
Mediterranean.

<HEADLINE> Achebe Named Goodwill Ambassador for U.N. Population Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Population Fund (UNFPA) Thursday announced the appointment of
renowned Nigerian author, Chinua Achebe, as a goodwill ambassador.
</P>
<P>
Achebe is regarded by many as the "father of the modern African
novel." His books "Things Fall Apart" (1958) and "No Longer at
Ease" (1960) marked a new era in African writing and sold millions
of copies around the world.
</P>
<P>
"I am delighted to have been appointed goodwill ambassador for
the Population Fund," Achebe told a press conference here. "I am a
strong supporter of the United Nations and its agencies and of the
work of the Population Fund in reproductive health and gender
equity."
</P>
<P>
"I think we who are comfortable often take things like health
care and family planning for granted and we forget about the
people who are in difficulty, they seem rather remote, but that
shouldn't be so. It is those who have difficult lives that we
should be concerned about," he said.
</P>
<P>
Achebe, who was born in 1930 in Nigeria, is currently Charles
Setevenson Professor of Literature at Bard College,
Annandale-on-Hudson, New York.
</P>
<P>
"We are honored to have Mr. Achebe as a goodwill ambassador
for the Population Fund," said Dr. Nafis Sadik, executive
director of UNFPA. "His standing as a legend of African writing
makes him a wonderful representative for the work of the fund,
especially in Africa."
</P>
<P>
"We look forward very much to working with him to promote the
responsibilities and rights of men and women everywhere in
regard to reproductive health care," the executive director said.
</P>
<P>
As a goodwill ambassador, Achebe will represent the fund at a
number of events taking place this year: These include the June
30-July 2 United Nations General Assembly special session, which
will review progress in the five years since the International
Conference on Population and Development, and the Day of Six
Billion on October 12, marking the growth of the world population
to more than 6 billion.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Population Fund is the world's largest
multilateral source of population assistance. Over the past 30
years, the fund has provided 4.3 billion U.S. dollars in
assistance to more than 160 countries. The fund's priority program
areas are reproductive health, population and development
strategies, and advocacy.

<HEADLINE> More Congo (K) Refugees Pouring into Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 7 (Xinhua) - Though a cease-fire summit by
conflicting parties in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is scheduled
late
this month, the DRC refugees are still pouring into western Tanzania over
the past few days, an official statement said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 645 DRC refugees have been received in Kigoma region between
November 23 last year and January 3 this year, the statement from the
Ministry of Home Affairs said.
</P>
<P>
"The latest flow of refugees from the DRC was on January 5 when 161
refugees were received at Kigoma by the United Nations High Commission for
Refugees (UNHCR)," it said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 110 refugees from Burundi have been received by UNHCR at
Kigoma during the same period.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the UNHCR planned a census of all refugees in Kigoma camps
this month to get a clear base of refugee statistics and curb dual
registration.
</P>
<P>
In a late last November statement, the Home Affairs Ministry said a
total of some 20,000 refugees from the DRC and Burundi had entered the
Kigoma Region since a bloody crisis broke out in DRC early August, bringing
the grand total to 236,425.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese refugees include those who had been repatriated
voluntarily from Kigoma camps under an exercise which was however halted in
August 8 following the emergence of new fighting in the central African
country.
</P>
<P>
By the time the voluntary repatriation of Congolese refugees came to a
halt, 27,075 refugees had been repatriated.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese refugees are fleeing battles taking place in the eastern
part of their country between DRC government forces loyal to President
Laurent Kabila and the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Claiming to be neutral in the DRC conflict, Tanzania recalled its
military advisors from DRC almost immediately after the conflict broke out
while other neighboring countries rushed their troops to either side of the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
The war has so far already drawn in Angola, Namibia, Chad, Libya, Sudan
and Zimbabwe on Kabila's side while the Tutsi-led rebels are backed by
Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Chief of Tanzania Defense Forces, General
Robert Mboma, arrived in Kigoma Wednesday on a three-day working visit.
</P>
<P>
He had met local defense and security officials and was expected to
inspect the Tanzania-Burundi border at Mnanila Manyovu in Kasulu District.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Forces Raze Lebanese Civilians' Houses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli forces Thursday razed 15
houses belonging to Lebanese civilians in a south Lebanon village
where Lebanese guerrillas had wounded an Isareli soldier two days
ago.
</P>
<P>
At dawn in the day, a patrol of 30 Israeli soldiers
accompanied by 30 bulldozers came to Arnoun village, just
outside the Israelis-carved security zone in south Lebanon, and
then they destroyed the 15 houses.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, an Israeli soldier was seriously wounded by a
roadside bomb near Arnoun, which was detonated by guerrillas
of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah guerrillas have long been staging attacks on Israeli
troops's posts through Arnoun which has been largely depopulated
by the conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-declared security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with a claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movements spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli occupying forces
out of the country.

<P>
2. What are the qualities needed to be a UNFPA goodwill
ambassador?
</P>
<P>
-- Goodwill ambassador should have a strong and expressed
interest in reproductive health care and in the status of women;
</P>
<P>
-- An ambassador should command national or international media
attention or work with the media;
</P>
<P>
-- An ambassador should have a demonstrated interest in human
rights and developing countries and peoples;
</P>
<P>
-- An ambassador should be prepared to take on the duties of an
ambassador, listed below.
</P>
<P>
An ambassador may have a relevant personal story and can serve
as a symbol to generate support for specific programs, e.g.,
against harmful traditional practices.
</P>
<P>
3. What are the duties of a UNFPA goodwill ambassador?
</P>
<P>
-- Visit UNFPA, IPPF and NGO reproductive health care and
family planning projects in developing countries to give

</P>
<P>
5. What are the goals of a UNFPA goodwill ambassador?
</P>
<P>
-- To bring to the attention of the public and decision-makers
throughout the world the needs of people in the developing world,
especially for reproductive health care, including family

Cairo in 1994 at the International Conference on Population and
Development (ICPD) to increase their financial contributions so
that the ICPD Program of Action can be fully implemented.
</P>
<P>
6. Are the UNFPA campaigns aimed at ordinary people?
</P>
<P>
-- Many people around the world recognize the right of all
women having access to reproductive health care, family planning
information and services, and reproductive rights. However, a
larger number of the same people are unaware of how many women do
not enjoy these rights and do not have access to these services;
how many women die daily because of a lack of these services; and
what mechanisms exist to help establish and guarantee reproductive
rights and deliver reproductive health care and family planning
services;
</P>
<P>
-- The UNFPA's awareness campaigns, such as the Face to Face
campaign, are designed to (1) bring these facts to the attention
of the public; (2) encourage people to participate in campaigns
through direct participation or advocacy activities; and (3)
create a constituency knowledgeable on these issues and support of
their governments international assistance commitments, especially
in the area of reproductive health.

<HEADLINE> Russia-Belarus Union May Face Legal Difficulty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Head of the Russian
Constitutional Court Marat Baglai said Thursday that the
Russian-Belarussian unification into one state may face legal
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Ekho Moskvy radio station, Baglai,
said "the legal aspect" of Russian-Belarussian unification into
one state is "the most difficult one."
</P>
<P>
The Russian constitution has provisions envisioning the
possibility of creating inter-state entities, as well as the
joining of the Russian Federation by a state as a constituent
member of the federation, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Belarus, a sovereign state which has a constitution
and elected authoritative bodies of its own, "will hardly want to
become a constituent member of the Russian Federation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Baglai believes that if Russia and Belarus merge into one
state, a single constitution will have to be adopted.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Belarussian and Russian leaders "have not yet
approached the unification problem in earnest."
</P>
<P>
"It's a thing of the future, at best, near future," Baglai
said.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Belarussian President
Alexander Lukashenko signed three accords in Moscow on December 25
that would further the pace of their union.
</P>
<P>
The documents included a declaration on the further unification
of the two former Soviet republics, a treaty of equal rights, and
an agreement on equal conditions for economic entities.

<HEADLINE> Greece Supports S-300 Missiles Deployment in Crete </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Greece stressed Thursday that
both Athens and Nicosia supported the idea of installing the
Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft missiles in the southern Greek
island of Crete instead of Cyprus itself.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said that this was the will of both the Greek and
Cypriot governments and would be implemented.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Cypriot government was now in contact with
Russia regarding issues related to the missiles.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen its defense, Cyprus decided earlier last year to
purchase and deploy the Russian missiles on the divided island,
but neighboring Turkey has threatened to use force to prevent the
missile deployment.
</P>
<P>
After consultations with Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis in
December, Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides announced in Nicosia
the cancellation of plans to install the missiles in Cyprus and
the start of negotiations with Moscow their possible deployment in
Crete.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Cyprus signed a joint defense pact in 1993, under
which Athens is bound to defend Nicosia in the event of renewed
hostilities.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on this, Reppas said that Athens stood firmly at the
side of Nicosia and would not do anything to jeopardize the strong
unity between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Blair, Mandela Report Progress on Lockerbie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 7 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela and British Prime Minister Tony Blair Thursday reported progress in
talks about the pending trial of two Libyans suspected of involvement in
the 1988 Lockerbie bombing.
</P>
<P>
After meeting at Mandela's Pretoria residence, the two leaders told
reporters that they had made headway on the outstanding issues.
</P>
<P>
Mandela and Blair declined to reveal details of their discussions.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very sensitive matter which involves three different
governments -- Libya, Britain and the United States," Mandela was quoted by
South African Press Association as saying.
</P>
<P>
"It will be improper for us to go into any details in regard to this
discussion except to say that we have made good progress and we think that
we are on the way to resolve all the outstanding issues."
</P>
<P>
Mandela announced that Jakes Gerwel, director-general in the president's
office, and Prince Bander, Saudi Arabian Ambassador to Washington, would
meet Libyan President Muammar Qaddafi in a matter of days to brief him on
Thursday's talks.
</P>
<P>
He also thanked the United Nations Security Council for allowing the
two delegates to fly straight to Libya despite U.N. imposed sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Blair said he and Mandela had made a lot of progress on the matter,
which he said many people believed could never be resolved.
</P>
<P>
"We have come a long way and we will carry on doing everything we
possibly can in order to make that progress," said the British prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
"We will do that not just for reasons of political relations between
countries, but also for people in my country out of a deep sense of respect
for the families of the Lockerbie victims and their desire for this trial
to happen and some light to be shed on what actually took place."
</P>
<P>
A bomb exploded on a U.S.-bound Pan Am airliner over the Scottish
town of Lockerbie on December 21, 1988, killing 270 people.
</P>
<P>
Libya has recently agreed with Britain and the U.S. that the two
Libyans stand trial in the Netherlands, but the trial still stalls as the
two sides could not agree on outstanding issues like where the two should
complete their sentences if convicted.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the recent U.S. and British bombings of Iraq, Mandela said: "
There is no issue which cannot be settled."
</P>
<P>
He said he had no doubt that Blair and U.S. President Bill Clinton
respected a U.N. resolution that its member countries should resolve their
problems through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that in due course the parties concerned will be able, using
the United Nations, to sit down and resolve this matter. That is how we
have solved some of the most intractable problems in our country."
</P>
<P>
Asked if he had tried to persuade Blair to drop Britain's bid to host
the 2006 soccer world cup, Mandela said he had forgotten and jokingly asked
the visitor: "Will you be generous enough to do this?"
</P>
<P>
Blair replied: "Friendly rivalry is always a good thing."
</P>
<P>
Blair paid tribute to Mandela, who is set to retire after this year's
general election.
</P>
<P>
"He has been throughout his entire life a shining light, and I don't
think that light will ever be dimmed," said Blair.
</P>
<P>
He described Mandela as a man of compassion, commitment, integrity,
strength and forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
Mandela quipped: "He is nice to an old man because he realizes that I
am no threat to him any longer."

<HEADLINE> Israel Defies U.S. Criticism Over Wye Suspension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 7 (Xinhua) - Israel Thursday refuted a blame
that the U.S. laid on it for the impasse in the Wye peace accord,
vowing not to transfer more land in the West Bank to the
Palestinians until they have fulfilled their obligations.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians should not look to Washington for help in
order to have Israel transfer more land, but should honor their
commitments under the Wye agreement instead, Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
U.S. administration took the Israeli government to task
Wednesday, disputing an article written by Israeli Ambassador
Zalman Shoval and published in the Washington Times in which he
pins blame on the Palestinians for the stalemate in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
In the article, Shoval insisted that Israel give no more land
to the Palestinians because they have failed to fulfill their
obligations.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said Wednesday the
Palestinians have in fact worked hard to implement their
commitments under the Wye agreement, including annulling
anti-Israel clauses in the Palestinian charter and stepping up the
fight against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"There are some commitments that still have to be fulfilled,
but overall they are making progress," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
He also said "the Israelis have not yet fulfilled their
obligations", referring to the phased Israeli troop withdrawals
from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to cobble his coalition cracking over the
Washington-brokered peace deal signed last October, Netanyahu
froze the implementation of the deal soon after Israel carried out
the first phase of the three-stage troop withdrawals in November,
citing alleged Palestinian violations.
</P>
<P>
David Bar-Illan, media adviser to Netanyahu, said it is
"peculiar" for Washington to demand that Israel overlook
Palestinian non-compliance and go ahead with the troop withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
He denied the early elections in May is behind the suspension
of the agreement, echoing Shoval's position that the Palestinians
should take more measures, including collecting illegal weapons
and halting incitement against Israel before Israel carries out
the pending withdrawals.

<HEADLINE> World Financiers Agree to Police Derivatives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 7 (Xinhua) -- A number of the world's largest
financial institutions have reached an agreement to police the
huge and volatile market of derivatives.
</P>
<P>
Top executives from 12 leading institutions in the United
States and other countries agreed at a meeting here Wednesday to
form a new group for setting guidelines, governing trading
practices, lending standards and disclosure requirement, the New
York Times said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, Chairman of the
Securities and Exchange Commission Arthur Levitt and other senior
officials also attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The agreement came after the near-collapse last September of
Long-Term Capital Management, the huge hedge fund, which had
invested heavily in derivatives. The financial industry had an
early attempt to control the derivatives market by setting its own
voluntary guidelines but got only a limited success.
</P>
<P>
The Long Term Capital, which borrowed heavily, was rescued by
the intervention of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York last year
when it threatened to wreak havoc on the financial market.
</P>
<P>
The co-chairmen of the industry group are Gerald Corrigan, the
former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York who is
now a senior executive at Goldman, Sachs, and Stephen Thieke, a
top official at J.P. Morgan. The other members of the group are
Barclays, Bear Stearns, Chase, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche
Bank, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
and UBS.
</P>
<P>
The derivatives market has boomed over the last decade to
become one of the most lucrative activities on Wall Street. About
37 trillion U.S. dollars worth of privately traded derivatives
contracts are outstanding, up from 865 billion U.S. dollars in
1987. However, the figures represent the paper value of all of the
underlying financial products used to create a derivatives
contract.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Stop to Outside Support for Sierra Leone Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States is pressing
the Liberian government to stop rebels in Sierra Leone from
receiving support through Liberian territory, a State Department
official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. government is especially concerned about external
regional support for the RUF (Revolutionary United Front)
insurgency," the official said.
</P>
<P>
The official could not say if the U.S. government had evidence
that support for the RUF rebels was coming directly from Liberian
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the rebels had penetrated the Sierra Leone capital
Freetown and were fighting the Western African peacekeeping force
ECOMOG for control of the city. Sporadic shooting erupted
overnight in the east of Freetown.
</P>
<P>
The United States suspended operations at its embassy in
Freetown on December 24 and encouraged Americans to leave.
</P>
<P>
"We're not sure how many Americans chose to remain in Sierra
Leone. We believe the number to be small. There were only 120
Americans registered with our embassy and they were notified of
our decision to send operations," State Department spokesman
James Rubin said Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Greece Dismisses Turkey for FIR Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Greece Thursday criticized
neighboring Turkey for the latter's attack on Athens regarding the
issue of Athens Flight Information Region (FIR).
</P>
<P>
Greece said that Turkey's aim was to change the status quo of
air traffic control in the Aegean Sea and to create problems in
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Turkey said Tuesday that Greece had been unable to fulfill its
technical duties in the Athens FIR since the 1980s. The Athens
FIR, which Greece has run since 1952, comprises Greek and
international airspace.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Turkish statement, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas described the Turkish claims as "unfounded" and
"full of inaccuracies."
</P>
<P>
He accused Ankara of distorting reality in its attempt to turn
a purely technical issue into a political one.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Reppas said that a new technologically
advanced air traffic control system would become operational next
month, which would provide two-fold coverage and consequently
greater flight safety.

DAR ES SALAAM, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government intends
to set up liaison offices in various regions so as to make government
information easily known to the common people.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the Liaison Officers' Workshop in
Dar es Salaam Thursday, Permanent Secretary in the Prime Minister's Office,
Ben Moses, said that the public is entitled to get information from the
government.
</P>
<P>
Moses said experiences show that the recently adopted policies such as
those on land, health and children have not been understood by the public
because deliberate efforts have not been made to publicize them.
</P>
<P>
He said that ministries and regional commissioners will be able to
inform people about the success and problems of the government easily
through liaison officers and media organizations.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Supreme Court Justice Presides Over Impeachment Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Supreme Court Justice
William Rehnquist was sworn in Thursday to preside over the
impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
The step marks the official opening of the Senate trial in
which the 100-member body will serve as jurors, sworn by Rehnquist
to an oath of impartiality.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time in the U.S. since the trial of Andrew
Johnson in 1868 that senators were asked to try a president.
</P>
<P>
Senate President Pro Tempore Strom Thurmond administered the
oath to Chief Justice Rehnquist in which he said, "I solemnly
swear that in all things appertaining to the trial of the
impeachment of President Bill Clinton, now pending, I will do
impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws: So help
me God."
</P>
<P>
Then, Rehnquist, wearing a black robe with gold stripes on the
arms, administered the same oath to all 100 Senate members who
will sit in judgment of the president on two impeachment articles
of perjury and obstruction of justice in the investigation of his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern. The
senators signed their names in an oath book.
</P>
<P>
On December 19 last year, the U.S. House of Representatives
passed on largely party-line votes the two articles of impeachment
against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The votes sent the issue to the Senate, where a two-thirds
majority must vote to convict Clinton in order to remove him from
office.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Not Sure to Seek Permanent UN Security Council Seat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESURG, January 7 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is still considering
whether or not to put itself forward as a candidate for a permanent seat on
the United Nations Security Council, Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said in
Pretoria Thursday.
</P>
<P>
There are a number of issues to be resolved first, Mbeki told reporters
after chairing a session of Britain-South Africa Bilateral Forum with
visiting British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said that questions, like whether only one African country should
have permanent status, have not been sorted out. "They don't just affect
the African continent," he said.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral forum also discussed the situation in Iraq. South Africa
and Britain agreed that Iraq should comply with U.N. Security Council
resolutions on international weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
Blair told reporters that Iraq would only become part of the community
of world nations by complying with these resolutions.
</P>
<P>
On the Angolan civil war, Mbeki said South Africa and Britain supported
the Security Council position that the world body should engage the warring
parties in talks in a search for a political solution.
</P>
<P>
Blair pledged that his country would do everything it could to promote
stability and negotiation between the two conflicting parties.
</P>
<P>
The war between the Angolan government troops and the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) has been going on since late
1970s.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan peace process went into stalemate because the UNITA did not
comply with the 1994 Lusaka Peace Protocol aiming to achieve final peace in
the war-torn country.

<P>
CAIRO, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
DUBAI -- Officials in charge of Gulf employment firms have
disclosed that employment markets in the Gulf will witness serious
pressures in 1999 due to the inappropriate economic conditions
resulting from the drop in oil prices and the aftermath of the
Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
In a study printed in Friday's issue of the "Gulf Business"
weekly, the officials said there are growing indications that the
escalating trend of salaries and wages in private companies in the
Gulf might have already reached its peak in 1998.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- Financial information printed in Friday's Saudi press
reveals that Saudi share market during the first week of 1999
registered a hike in prices of circulating shares, prompting a
rise in market index to 145.13 points as compared to 141.31 points
on Thursday last week, an increase of 3.82 points or 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The National Bank of Abu Dhabi index of the United
Arab Emirates climbed by 228.57 points during the first week of
1999 to reach 3,814.09 points, an increase of 6.37 percent.
</P>
<P>
Friday's "Al Hayat" daily quoted Ziyad Al Dabbas, director of
the bank's local shares department, as saying the hike in the
index was an outcome of the recovery of local share market demand,
which, in turn, led to a big rise in share prices of local
companies and banks.

<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The famous French
pharmaceutical company Rhone-Poulenc Rorer (RPR) donated medical
products valued at one million yuan to the China Rheumatology
Association today.
</P>
<P>
RPR Marketing Director Jean Marc Barial noted that the
products are used by millions of people around the world, with
international sales ranking 3rd in terms of similar products.
</P>
<P>
The donated pharmaceuticals will be distributed to hospitals
in 11 provinces and prescription sales will be available by the
end of January.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey revealed a high prevalence of rheumatic
diseases in China, with some 18 percent of Chinese citizens
suffering from arthritis. The donated medicine will be used to
treat an estimated 10,000 patients.
</P>
<P>
Oruvail and Profenid are anti-inflamatory agents with no side
effects and significantly greater efficacy than older medicines
such as aspirin. One Oruvail capsule replaces 16 aspirins.
</P>
<P>
Two RPR joint ventures in China will commence production of
Oruvail and Profenid at the end of 1999. However, China will
continue to import the products until the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
RPR is a global pharmaceutical subsidiary of Rhone-Poulenc
S.A., and a new company known as Aventis which will be
incorporated in France to replace the former is expected to
become the world's second largest pharmaceutical company.

<P>
HONG KONG, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong recorded a slight
decrease in the number of regional representation by overseas
companies in 1998, according to a government survey released here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Conducted by the Industry Department, the survey shows that
there were a total of 2,449 regional operations in Hong Kong in
1998, including 819 regional headquarters and 1,630 regional
offices.
</P>
<P>
The figure was an overall drop of 2.6 percent from the
previous year, said Director-General of Industry Francis Ho here
Friday at a press conference. The decrease was due to a 9.3
percent net fall in the number of regional headquarters, from 903
to 819.
</P>
<P>
Ho explained that overseas companies downgraded their presence
because of "high operating cost in Hong Kong" and "reducing
business prospects in the region following the Asian financial
turmoil".
</P>
<P>
The official noted that 65 new regional headquarters were
established in 1998, and 95 percent of overseas companies
responded that they would continue to operate in Hong Kong.

MACAO, January 8 (Xinhua) -- A series of violent crimes taking
place here over the past few days of the new year have aroused
more concern about public security.
</P>
<P>
In addition to looting and kidnapping, there were five
gun-related violent crimes this year, which left one dead and
five injured. In two separate incidents, the manager of a
gambling hall was shot and killed and a prison warden was
seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
Many of the crimes were believed to be committed by underworld
gang members.
</P>
<P>
In response to the series of violent incidents, Manuel Soares
Monge, secretary for security of the Macao government, said that
certain evil forces were challenging the society, and that police
forces in Macao would take effective measures to strengthen
investigations and prevent organized crimes.
</P>
<P>
Jorge Silveira, secretary for justice, also voiced his concern
over the series of gun-related crimes at the very beginning of
the year, saying that "Macao faces a difficult year in terms of
public security conditions."
</P>
<P>
He pledged that the judicial forces in his charge will exert
utmost efforts to back public security police in cracking down on
criminal cases and hunting principals.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Chinese government has been paying
close attention to the public security conditions in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Chen Ziying, vice-director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs
Office under China's State Council, said earlier this week that
the Portuguese Macao government should take practical
responsibility for improving public security in the final year of
Macao's transitional period so that a smooth handover can be
achieved.
</P>
<P>
Chen reiterated that "the Chinese side will abide by the
Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration and give full support to help
maintain Macao's social stability and economic growth."
</P>
<P>
Zhu Bangzao, spokesman for China's Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, said at a regular press conference Thursday that "the
Portuguese Macao government is responsible for public security in
Macao and maintaining social stability in Macao's
late-transitional period."
</P>
<P>
"In the meantime, the Chinese side is ready to offer help and
cooperation within our power," he said.
</P>
<P>
The crimes have also stirred new anxiety among local
residents, who pointed out that poor public security has affected
the local economy and the daily life of the residents to great
extent, expressing the wish that senior police officers would
boost the morale of police forces and crack down on major
criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
In view of the deteriorating public security, police forces
have intensified crackdown on underworld gang activities. On
Thursday afternoon, Macao police arrested a 35-year-old man, who
is believed to be a ringleader of 14K, an organized gang in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Portugal has offered a helping hand, too. A third group of
about 10 Portuguese police officers came to Macao on Tuesday, and
is expected to help improve the security conditions in Macao. In
August and October of last year, two groups of police officers
had been sent to work here.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday morning, the new building of Macao's task force
police was put into official use. Meanwhile, the task force
police have been reorganized to include a special mission team, a
bomb-dismantling team and a team using police dogs.
</P>
<P>
Following the reorganization, task force policemen will be
crack members of Macao's police forces and will perform their
duties more effectively in keeping public order and intensify the
crackdown on violent crimes, a senior officer said.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader Blames Foreigners for Political </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei on Friday pointed the finger at foreigners for the
recent political murders, though the Intelligence Ministry
has admitted the involvement of its agents in the killings.
</P>
<P>
The recent political killings in Iran "could not have been
without a foreign scenario," Khamenei said at the Friday prayers
congregation on the campus of Tehran University.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the issue is over, this seems to be a long
story and I cannot accept that these murders took place without a
foreign scenario behind them," he said.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said that he has instructed the Intelligence Ministry
to go after the issue and find the clues. "I believe it is an
orchestrated scenario and the root cause must be discovered," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Intelligence Ministry on Tuesday announced that some of
its own agents were involved in the political murders of
a opposition leader and some dissident intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
The admittance shocked the Iranian society, but some senior
officials believed that there were some foreign hands in the
killings.
</P>
<P>
Darius Forouhar, leader of the Iran Nation Party and his wife
were stabbed to death at home in November while at least three
dissident writers were mysteriously murdered in December.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian leader praised Intelligence Minister Qorbanali
Dorri Najafabadi and his personnel for their "brave" move in
disclosing the recent killings.
</P>
<P>
"They left behind a very difficult experience and it is not a
joke for them to feel a weak point within and raise the matter
with the people honestly," he said.
</P>
<P>
Following the admittance of the Intelligence Ministry, some
reports said that Iranian President Mohammad Khatami vowed to
dismiss Najafabadi.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei believed that the Intelligence Ministry had some
enemies and with the recent exposures, the enemies intended to
take revenge of the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Cases even more acute than what had happened in Iran were
rampant with the intelligence services of other countries, such
as the CIA, the Mossad, he said, "you will be shocked to learn
about the scope of the crimes, assassinations, bombings,
intimidation, etc. committed by these intelligence services."
</P>
<P>
He accused the foreign media, including western radio
services, of always trying to undermine the Islamic regime in
Iran, saying that over the past two decades, these media had
taken advantage of every sweet or bitter event in Iran to harm
the Islamic system.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian leader also blamed domestic media and said "I am
not surprised at the propaganda ballyhoo of the foreign media,
but I am surprised at what some of our own media, including the
press, are doing."
</P>
<P>
"They are acting exactly like our enemies, they are like a
stupid child who would make fun of his father when he is at adds
with someone else," he said.

<HEADLINE> Japanese FM Ends Visit to Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Foreign Minister
Masahiko Komura Friday concluded his brief official visit to
Lebanon, the first since the two countries established diplomatic
relations in 1941.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in the country, Komura held talks with
Lebanese President Emile Lahoud and Prime Minister and Foreign
Minister Salim Hoss on regional affairs and bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Hoss told reporters that their talks
focused on the Israeli daily aggression on Lebanon, especially
the recent escalated air attacks on Lebanese civilians.
</P>
<P>
In the past two weeks, eight Lebanese civilians, including a
mother and her six children, had been killed and another seven
civilians wounded in Israeli air raids on eastern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hoss said the Japanese foreign minister expressed his country's
support for Lebanon's legal demand concerning the Israeli
unconditional withdrawal from the country.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-declared security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government proposed last April to withdraw its
troops from Lebanon provided that the Lebanese government agree a
negotiated security arrangement in advance.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and its close ally Syria flatly rejected the offer,
urging the Israeli troops to leave the country without any
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Hoss said their talks also covered matters with regard to the
five Japanese Red Army members who were sentenced by Lebanese
court to three years each in 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said the question about the five Japanese convicted of
entering Lebanon with forged passports and visas would be raised
up only after they completed their terms in Lebanese prison.
</P>
<P>
Japan has been seeking to extradite these five citizens to the
country.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese foreign minister arrived here from Egypt on Friday
and left for Syria later in the day. He will also visit Jordan,
Israel and the Palestinian self-rule areas.

<P>
LUSAKA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Minister of Energy and Water Development
Benjamin Mwila has appealed to the Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation
(ZESCO) workers to return to work, saying their grievances cannot be
addressed in a crisis situation.
</P>
<P>
The minister, who addressed the striking workers at the ZESCO head
office in Lusaka Friday, said the strike was without the blessing of
government and not in the interest of the country, Zambia News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Mwila said it is only prudent that the workers, who he said are
essential to the nation, resume work to allow for their representatives,
management and a government team address their grievances.
</P>
<P>
He said it is important to be disciplined in resolving industrial
disputes, saying there is no justification for the workers to strike.
</P>
<P>
 Striking will only destroy what we have already built, the minister
added.
</P>
<P>
 The ZESCO workers strike commenced in Ndola two days ago and has
spread to the capital Lusaka and other copperbelt towns such as Kitwe.
</P>
<P>
 ln Lusaka, the striking workers charged that management had neglected
them by not fulfilling its promises. Last month, Deputy Minister of the
ministry, Celestino Chibamba reassured the workers that they would be paid
their bonus even after Christmas.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Up on Weak U.S. Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar spiked
higher Friday, spurred by a weaker U.S. dollar, soaring gold
prices and fading early interest in the euro.
</P>
<P>
The domestic currency added more than three quarters of a U.S.
cent Thursday night, jumping to a five-week high of 63.69 U.S.
cents in early trading here.
</P>
<P>
It dipped to a low of 63.18 U.S. cents during the day, and
ended the session at 63.22 cents from its close Thursday of 62.90.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was also buying 0.5406 euro from 0.5410
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
MMS Standard &AMP; Poor's currency strategist Alex Douglas said the
strong performance in gold Thursday night was one of several
factors impacting positively on the domestic currency.
</P>
<P>
"Also we've had U.S. dollar/yen falling," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It dipped below 110 (yen) at one point, which was a fairly
significant sort of level.
</P>
<P>
"A generally weaker U.S. dollar and a firmer yen help us to
rise."
</P>
<P>
BNP senior strategist Clifford Bennett said Australia had a
history of tracking the yen, the major currency in the region.
</P>
<P>
"The movement in the yen is perhaps some early warning signs
that the Japanese economy might be bottoming and that would
certainly be good for Australia," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the local close the Australian dollar finished trading at
70.16 Japanese yen from 70.72.

<P>
He noted that China must unswervingly implement Deng
Xiaoping's Theory that science and technology are primary
productive forces. He said the strategy for using science and
education to revitalize the nation and strategy for pursuing

<HEADLINE> Manila to Give Top Priority to Agricultural </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
give top priority to agricultural development in order to achieve
food security and emancipate rural folk from poverty, President
Joseph Estrada said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a report on his administration's accomplishments in its
first six months, Estrada said that food security and agricultural
development are the two most potent weapons in his administration
all-out battle against poverty as the vast majority of Filipinos
still depend on agriculture for their income and livelihood.
</P>
<P>
In the remaining years of his administration, Estrada said that
he hopes to be able to distribute to farmers 8.2 million of
hectares of land under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program.
</P>
<P>
The government has already attained half its target, or the
distribution of some 4 million hectares of land to farmers, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"By the year 2001, the country would be self-sufficient in
rice, corn and sugar with the agriculture modernization program as
the main tool for achieving that goal," he said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said that the government will continue to pursue its
10-point agenda for agriculture, which include the expansion of
existing productivity programs, irrigation, post harvest
facilities, research and marketing information, credit assistance,
food price stabilization and the quick response to calamities.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Philippines' economic situation, Estrada said:
"Although our economic growth (in 1998) was not as strong as in
the years before, it kept us out of a recession."
</P>
<P>
The economy proved so resilient that today, the country
continues to enjoy positive growth despite the crisis in Asia, he
said.
</P>
<P>
However, Estrada said, 1999 will be a critical year for the
economy, which faces a gross national product growth target of at
least 3 percent so it can go full steam ahead by 2000.
</P>
<P>
"The challenges that we expect to face in 1999 are tests which
we can only pass if we are united as a people... the characters of
our people, the ability to fight back despite the odds, is the
source of resiliency of our economic, political and social
systems," he said.

<HEADLINE> 38 Nigerian Soldiers Killed in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LAGOS, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Some 38 soldiers of the Nigerian
contingent of the West African peace-keeping force ECOMOG have been killed
in the battle for the control of Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone, the
Nigerian newspaper Post Express Friday quoted military sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
 The military sources said that the dead soldiers were flown into
Nigeria
Sunday night alongside wounded soldiers on board the military transport
plane,
the C-130 E Hercules.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers were buried at a military cemetary at the Ojo military
barracks in Lagos.
</P>
<P>
However, the Acting Director of Defence Information, Sam Tella denied
knowledge of any corpses being brought into the country from war-torn
Sierra Leone, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
 Sam Tella, as the defence spokesman told reporters Thursday that
though the situation in Sierra Leone was "confusing", military level
consultations were going on
over how to appropriately deal with the situation.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG will not stand by and allow the legitimate government of
President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah to be ousted again, he stressed, adding that "
Nigeria expects normalcy to return to Sierra Leone in the shortest possible
time".
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is the largest provider of troops to the ECOMOG force which was
initially
set up by the Economic Community of the West African States (ECOWAS) in
1990 and currently deployed in Sierra Leone where it ousted a military
junta in February 1998 and reinstated President Kabbah in March last year.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Police tighten Security During Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli police decided on
Friday to step up security protections for all candidates for the
prime minister during the current election campaign.
</P>
<P>
This decision was made following Thursday's incident in Tel
Aviv, in which the life of Amnon Lipkin-Shahak was threatened by a
local resident.
</P>
<P>
Shahak, the newly retired chief of general staff of the
defense force and one of the prime minister's candidates, did not
see many smiling faces Thursday in his first campaign foray into
the traditional Likud territory of the outdoor Hatikva market in
south Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
What he did encounter there were a lot of faces in hatred,
fists brandished at him, curses and flying bits of chicken,
tomatos, oranges and even parts of booths aimed at him.
</P>
<P>
What scared him and his campaign staff more was a little guy
shouting at them.
</P>
<P>
The decision to send Shahak into hostile territory immediately
after his announcement of prime minister candidacy was made a
week ago, his staff said, but no one in his election headquarters
foresaw the violent reception he would receive, which was
triggered possibly by his statement on Wednesday that "Netanyahu
is a danger to Israel."
</P>
<P>
The Tel Aviv police have decided to investigate the Thursday
case and the police would not allow anybody to threaten prime
minister candidates during the election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Labor party central committee approved Thursday
night the party political bureau's recommendation to hold
primaries for the party's Knesset (parliament) candidates on
February 15.
</P>
<P>
Labor party leader Ehud Barak till now is the sole candidate
for prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The Likud party decided to choose party chairman on January
25. Its party chairman will be the candidate for prime
minister.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Over 6,000 large industrial
enterprises will simply have to complete registration procedure
to receive trade rights beginning this month.
</P>
<P>
 According to the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC), the registered state-owned industrial
enterprises will be permitted to import and export their own
products.
</P>
<P>
 Enterprises administrated by the central government can
register directly with MOFTEC, while firms under the
administration of local governments will be required to submit
registration applications to foreign trade departments in their
respective provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities and
cities with provincial status.
</P>
<P>
 The move will surely sharpen the competitive edge of the
large enterprises and expand exports, the MOFTEC sources said.
</P>
<P>
 Statistics indicate that the 10,708 Chinese manufacturers
with trade rights account for 10 percent of China's total trade
volume.
</P>
<P>
 All large industrial enterprises have been granted the
import and export rights jointly by the State Economic and Trade
Commission, State Development Planning Commission, State
Statistics Bureau, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Labor and
Ministry of Human Resources since 1992.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Friday announced a major cabinet reshuffle in
which Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi was appointed as
deputy prime minister and home minister.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister's post has been left vacant since
Anwar Ibrahim was sacked as the deputy prime minister and finance
minister, but the finance minister's post was filled up when
Mahathir himself became the first finance minister and appointed
Mustapha Mohamed as second finance minister.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir was also the home minister before Friday's reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
In the reshuffle, Special Functions Minister Tun Daim Zainuddin
was appointed as finance minister.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Syed Hahid Albar took over as the new foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
Abang Abu Bakar Mustapha who is minister in the Prime
Minister's Department, was appointed as defense minister.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Home Minister Tajol Rosli Ghazali was promoted to
minister in the Prime Minister's Department.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir announced the reshuffle at a news conference after
chairing the monthly UMNO (United Malays National Organization)
Supreme Council meeting.
</P>
<P>
The major reshuffle came just one day after Inspector-General
of Police Rahim Noor announced his resignation, assuming the
responsibility for the injuries to former deputy prime minister
Anwar Ibrahim during his police detention.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, who is on trial in the High Court on four corruption
charges, Thursday filed a memorandum of appeal through his counsel
Karpal Singh at the Court of Appeal registry here, against the
High Court's decision striking out his suit against Mahathir and
the Malaysian government.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, who was sacked as the deputy prime minister and finance
minister on September 2 last year, claimed his dismissal was
unconstitutional and that Mahathir had contravened Article 43 (5)
of the Federal Constitution in removing him.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Hezbollah Fires Mortar on Northern Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas
fired several mortar shells on western Galilee in northern Israel
Friday morning, but no damage was reported, Israel Radio said.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted Lebanese sources as saying that Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God, shelled the areas in response to the
demolition of civilian houses in south Lebanon by Israeli
soldiers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli forces razed 15 civilian houses in Arnoun village
Thursday where Lebanese guerrillas wounded an Israeli soldier a
day earlier.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army believes that Arnoun, largely depopulated by
the conflicts, has been used by guerrillas to place bombs.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah issued a statement after the demolition, warning that
"the arm of the resistance will twist the necks of the criminal
aggressors."
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah has been spearheading a guerrilla war against Israeli
troops since 1985 when Israel set up a self-declared security zone
in south Lebanon with a claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
The guerrilla group also attacked Israeli military outposts in
the western sector of the zone Friday but caused no casualties,
Israel Radio said.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have been running high in the 15-kilometer-deep buffer
zone over the last few weeks when Israeli forces killed or wounded
a dozen Lebanese civilians during air strikes against Hezbollah
bases.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah have sporadicly fired Katyusha rockets or mortar
shells into northern Israel in retaliation for Israel's attacks
against Lebanese civilians.

Israeli cabinet last week adopted a proposal submitted by the
army that Israel should strike against Lebanese infrastructure
targets if Israel's northern areas were attacked by Hezbollah.

<P>
But the army chief, Shaul Mofaz, said later that it's not in

Lebanon.

Israel Radio quoted Hezbollah officials as saying Friday that
the sole reason for the existence of Hezbollah in south Lebanon

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's New Deputy PM Promises Dedication to Duties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's newly-appointed
Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi promised Friday night
to discharge his duties as best he can and with full dedication.
</P>
<P>
The 59-year old Abdullah was named the deputy prime minister
and home minister earlier Friday in a cabinet reshuffle announced
by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad after a Supreme Council meeting
of the ruling United Malays National Organization (UMNO).
</P>
<P>
Thanking Mahathir for his trust, Abdullah, who is one of the
three UMNO vice-presidents, told reporters "I was surprised
because my other colleagues considered for the post by the prime
minister are just as capable."
</P>
<P>
He said he needed Mahathir's guidance in discharging his new
duties and responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah also said that he hoped to get cooperation from his
colleagues in the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Syed Hamid Albar took over from Abdullah as
foreign minister in the reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah, who joined UMNO in 1965, became active in politics in
1978 when he was elected the Member of Parliament and retained his
parliamentary constituency for five terms until today.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah was deputy federal territory minister in 1980, his
first post in the government. In 1981 when he was elected to the
UMNO Supreme Council, Abdullah was made minister in the Prime
Minister's Department in Mahathir's first cabinet. Abdullah also
served as minister of education in 1984, minister of Defense in
1986.
</P>
<P>
He was made foreign minister in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah, who failed to retain the UMNO vice-presidency in 1993
but was appointed a member of the UMNO Supreme Council, made a
comeback when he was elected vice-president for the 1996/1999
term.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Close Sharply Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The froth that had engulfed the
Australian sharemarket evaporated Friday as shares closed sharply
lower, with blue chips leading the market down as concern surfaced
about the future impact of the strong Australian dollar on
export-oriented stocks.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said another contributor to the fall was the sharp rise
in the Japanese yen against a weakening U.S. currency and falls
sustained in the Japanese equities market.
</P>
<P>
They also said the smaller premium on the futures market's
share price index contract over the benchmark all ordinaries index
indicated "a little bit of non-confidence" and "cooling-off" in
the physical market.
</P>
<P>
"Now we might see a little bit of sobriety coming into the
market," said senior dealer Stuart Smith of Henderson Charlton
Jones.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries, after breaking through the 2,900-point
barrier for the first time Thursday and dipping to close at a
record high, Friday dropped 41 points, or 1.42 percent, to
2,856.3, off a high of 2,897.3 and a low of 2,850.8.
</P>
<P>
Market heavyweight News Corp. led the blue chip falls, with its
scrip losing 43 cents, or 3.93 percent, and its preferred scrip
losing 45, or 4.43 percent.
</P>
<P>
Bank stocks also sustained losses after the share prices of the
National Australia Bank, Commonwealth Bank of Australia and
Westpac Banking Corp. reached new heights Thursday, with the
banking index falling 1.87 percent.
</P>
<P>
NAB dipped 21.9 cents, Westpac plunged 40.3, CBA dropped 50 and
ANZ Banking Group lost 26 cents.
</P>
<P>
Among other leading industrial stocks, Telstra Corp. closed
seven cents lower, Brambles Industries lost 94.3 cents, Lend Lease
fell 34.4, Woolworths slumped 10.
</P>
<P>
But Cable &AMP; Wireless Optus, which topped turnover in shares
traded, bucked the negative trend, gaining three cents on a volume
of 16.8 million shares.
</P>
<P>
In the resources sector, BHP plunged 36.2, or 3.03 percent, Rio
Tinto dropped 33.8, but WMC gained four.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials finished 76 points lower at 5,173.3 and the
all resources index closed 11.7 points lower at 950.5.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was a thin 344.76 million shares valued at
1.02 billion Australian dollars (647.7 million U.S. dollars), with
678 falls outnumbering 536 rises and 404 stocks remaining steady.
</P>
<P>
Buoyed by strong gains in gold bullion prices in New York
Thursday night, the gold index also defied the negative sentiment,
closing 20.5 points higher at 1,135.7. Gold bullion closed 2.90
higher at 291.15 U.S. dollars an ounce.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Defense Minister Urges to Careful handle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, January 8 -- Cambodia's Co-Defense Minister Tea
Banh emphasized Friday that Khmer Rouge issue must be handled
carefully and skillfully, because it concerns the peace and
stability of the country.
</P>
<P>
Tea Banh told the reporters after the meeting of ministers of
cabinet that government's decision to allow the defectors to
return to Pailin, a western province controlled by defected Khmer
Rouge leader Ieng Sary, was a "special way for Cambodia to bring
peace and stability and end suffering for the country."
</P>
<P>
When asked about if there was a danger of renewed war, Tea Banh
said:" We can not say at the moment before the Khmer Rouge leaders
are arrested, but more fighting would bring suffering to Cambodia
again."
</P>
<P>
"It (the Khmer Rouge issue) is rather complicated and
particular. We should not focus on certain person but also on
others," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
So far, three Khmer Rouge leaders have surrendered to the
government. Ieng Sary surrendered in 1996. Khieu Samphan and Nuon
Chea surrendered to the royal government on December 25 and
received warm welcome from the government.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Addresses Military Modernization (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said recently that the combat effectiveness of the People's
Liberation Army (PLA) has been upgraded to a new stage over the
past two decades.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the PLA has made significant contributions
to safeguarding and building the country, as well as promoting
world peace.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin, chairman of the Central Military Commission, made
the comments during an important military conference held on
December 25, 1998.
</P>
<P>
"The principle of building a modern army with Chinese
characteristics ensures the army's preparedness for ward-off
preemptive strikes, as well as large-scale wars and nuclear war,"
according to Jiang.
</P>
<P>
"We have implemented a strategy of using science and
technology to strengthen the army, and are focusing on related
development rather than intensive manpower.
</P>
<P>
"The PLA has withstood serious tests and has strictly adhered
to a correct political orientation, while at the same time
maintaining the true nature and purpose of the people's army, as
well as a high degree of stability and concentrated unity."
</P>
<P>
"Facts prove that the Chinese army is indeed the people's army
under absolute leadership of the Communist Party of China. The
army is politically qualified, fully capable of passing the stiff
tests and completely reliable to work for the Party and the
people," said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He specifically cited the counteroffensive in the late 1970s,
a series of joint military maneuvers between May 1995 and June
1996, the garrisoning of troops in the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) on July 1, 1997, and the victory
over record summer flooding in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Estrada: PAL to Be Managed by Cathay Executives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada announced here Friday that the Philippine Airlines (PAL)
will be managed by the executives of the Hong Kong-based Cathay
Pacific Airways under an agreement reached by the two airlines.
</P>
<P>
In a report on his administration's accomplishments in its
first six months Friday night, Estrada said, "The Philippine
Airlines has just forged an agreement with Cathay Pacific and
effective immediately, PAL will be managed by Cathay Pacific
executives."
</P>
<P>
But he did not elaborate on any future strategic cooperation
between the two airlines.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement issued Friday night, PAL said the Board of
Directors of Philippine Airlines and the Interim Rehabilitation
Receiver of PAL approved Friday a five-year technical services
agreement with Regent Star Services Ltd. (RSS), a Hong Kong-based
aviation management consultancy firm.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, five former top executives of Cathay
Pacific Airways, all RSS partners, will serve as advisers to PAL
management in their respective areas of expertise.
</P>
<P>
"This group would have formed the same management team had the
PAL-Cathay partnership pushed through last year," PAL said.
</P>
<P>
It said the approval of the agreement is in line with PAL's
commitment to all its stakeholders to improving management
performance.
</P>
<P>
It is also intended to deliver a continuous stream of tangible
improvements in PAL operations, particularly during the
implementation of the flag carrier's rehabilitation plan, PAL
said.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Addresses Military Modernization (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang said the highest priority in military modernization must
be placed on revolutionizing the army in order to determine the
nature and orientation of the PLA modernization.
</P>
<P>
The major contradiction facing the PLA is the incompatibility
between China's modernization level and the demand for modern
warfare, said Jiang. He added that the army must center on its
modernization drive in order to increase its combat readiness.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the modernization drive demands regularizing the
army. He noted that an important task of the regularization
centers on defining the basic achievements and experience in
revolutionization and modernization in the form of laws and
regulations to ensure that the military operates in strict
accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that properly handling the relationship between
quantity and quality is vital to the military modernization
effort.
</P>
<P>
The worldwide development of science and technology, as well
as improvements of military hardware make "it increasingly
important to improve the quality of the PLA," said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He said the key aspect for improving quality lies in using
science and technology to invigorate the army and to increase its
defense and combat effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also pointed to army's dependence on people as its
source of strength.
</P>
<P>
"The strategic theory of a people's war requires a capable
standing army and powerful reserve forces to ensure national
defense," said Jiang, adding that China must maintain smaller
troops in the peacetime and mobilize more forces in times of war.
</P>
<P>
He said the formation of a reserve national defense force must
comply with the characteristics of future military operations and
the requirements for a socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
The president said concerned departments must work hard to
improve the quality of reserve forces, and both the
organizational system and relevant policies.

"We have correctly grasped and solved several important issues
related to military modernization over the past 20 years," said
Jiang. "It is essential for us to seriously summarize past
experiences in order to further promote military modernization
and realize both national defense and military goals."
</P>
<P>
Jiang outlined several aspects related to the historical
development of military modernization. He pointed to the
relationship between war and peace, and noted that for a long
period in the past, China faced serious political and military
threats from the blockade and hostilities from the outside.
"Preparing for the danger of war was correct," said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
However, the international situation was subject to monumental
changes between 1980 and 1990. The CPC Central Committee affirmed
that easing international tensions represented an irreversible
trend. The committee also concluded that enjoying a good
international climate and good relations with neighboring
countries was indeed realistic.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, according to Jiang, China must unswervingly conduct
reform and opening, while continuing to accelerate the
modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
"Hegemonism and power politics still exist," said Jiang. "We
must resolutely safeguard the unity of the motherland and the na
tion's territorial integrity."
</P>
<P>
"We must carry out military modernization drive and be fully
prepared for the possibility of a military confrontation,"
according to the president.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also elaborated on the relationship between national
defense and economic construction. "Two strategic tasks for the
modernization drive center on energizing and ensuring a strong
national defense."
</P>
<P>
"The development of national defense must be subordinated to
economic construction. We must extend great efforts to strengthen
national defense while concentrating on economic construction,"
said Jiang, adding that "we must forge a system which ensures the
coordinated development of national defense and economic
construction."

Jiang noted that the long tradition of the PLA represents an
essential guarantee for maintaining the nature and combat
strength of the army.
</P>
<P>
The PLA has carried out a series of reforms over the past two
decades and has recorded significant breakthroughs in improving
both its modernization and combat effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
He instructed the army to deepen reform and formulate policies
and measures in line with the socialist market economy to enhance
the initiative of all sectors of the PLA.
</P>
<P>
The PLA's modernization drive must be conducted in line with
the tide of worldwide military innovation and development, said
Jiang, adding that the PLA must actively absorb the useful
experience of armies of other countries, especially developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that "the PLA is a people's army under
the absolute leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and as
such must retain its unique political nature and advantages
instead of simply copying principles of foreign armies."
</P>
<P>
He said the PLA's achievements and experience in military
modernization over the past two decades proceeded under the
guidance of Deng Xiaoping's ideas on building the Chinese army in
the new era.
</P>
<P>
"We must continue to follow Deng Xiaoping Theory while
exploring the road ahead and must further enrich and develop the
late leader's ideas on military modernization," said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the army must go all-out to train more outstanding
young officers who have both abilities and moral integrity to
ensure the energetic development of the People's Liberation
Army.

</P>
<P>
In a report on his administration's accomplishments in its

</P>
<P>
"Our experience over the past six months has once again

For 1999, Estrada said, he intends to continue a

investors and at the same time to maintain peace and order.
</P>
<P>
"The challenges that we expect to face in 1999 are tests which
we can only pass if we are united as a people... The character of

<P>
LUANDA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The soldiers of the rebel National
Union for the Total independence of Angola (UNITA) Thursday raided a diamond
mine in Lunda-Norte Province, killing four people, including two
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The Angola Diamond Company announced Friday that the deceased were
Patrick Bergin, a British and Mario Trepechio, a Brazilian and two Angolan
security men.
</P>
<P>
The mine under the diamond company was actually paralyzed after the
killing, which brought "extreme terror" among workers and some foreign
managers and technicians were planning to leave, said Chairman of the
management board of the company, jose Dias.
</P>
<P>
Diamond is the foreign currency-earner for the government and major
economic source for UNITA's purchase of weapons and logistics supply.
</P>
<P>
The Lunda-Norte Province is one of the important diamond production
areas in Angola, an area haunted by UNITA men. There were two
slaughters in the area in 1997, when 150 and 24 people were killed
respectively.

<HEADLINE> Diplomatic Efforts Needed to End Angolan Conflicts: Chissano </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 8 (XInhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano has
said that the international community should make more diplomatic efforts
to end conflicts in Angola and bring UNITA Chairman Jonas Savimbi to the
negotiation table.
</P>
<P>
Chissano made the remarks Thursday at a press conference in Chimoio,
central west Angola, after meeting with visiting Malawian President Bakili
Muluzi, the Noticias newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Our position is to settle the conflict through negotiations instead of
 through military force. It is our hope that Savimbi will return to the
negotiation table," he said.
</P>
<P>
 On the issue of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Chissano said, his
government was worried about the political crisis in the DRC and hopes that
the people of the DRC will enjoy lasting peace, social and political
stability.  Chissano also pledged his support for all diplomatic efforts
by other countries to settle the crisis.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Muluzi said the wars in Angola and the DRC have
hampered the development of the two countries and the African continent,
painting a poor image of Africa in the eyes of international society.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the war in Angola will end if Savimbi of the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) gives up its belligerent
mentality.
</P>
<P>
Chissano also revealed that he and Muluzi also discussed issues
concerning bilateral cooperation. He announced that ministers of the two
countries will soon hold talks in Maputo on the use of Nacala Corridor in
the north of the country.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Stock Market in 1998 Yields Return of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The year 1998 concluded with
very satisfactory returns for the Cyprus Stock Market, while
market prices fluctuated intensely, a weekly market review said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The review, issued by the Cyprus Investment and Securities
Corportion Limited (CISCO), said the CICSO All-share index closed
at 453.9 points as at December 31, 1998, achieving a capital
appreciation of 16.6 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
The total market return for 1998, after taking into
consideration the dividend yield for the same period of 4.8
percent is estimated at 21.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
This return ranks 6th in the market's 15-year history, with
the year 1995 being at the top of the list with a spectacular
total return of 58.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The first three trading sessions of the new year saw the
market being set on a slow, but uninterrupted advance. The CISCO
Al-share index closed on January 7, 1999 at 457.3 points, an
advance of 3.4 points or 0.7 percent since the year-end.
</P>
<P>
The total volume of transactions for the year 1998 reached
347 million Cyprus pounds (694 million U.S. dollars), compared
to 170.8 million pounds (341.6 million dollars) in 1997 and
231.4 million pounds (462.8 million dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Banking titles were the most actively traded stocks during the
year (absorbing 44.5 percent of the total volume), followed by
the warrants (13.1 percent) and insurance titles (11.9 percent).

<HEADLINE> Quoting Airline Fares in Foreign Currency Illegal in Zimbabwe: M inister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 8 (Xinhua) -- It is illegal for any airline operating
from Zimbabwe to quote air fares in U.S. Dollars or any other foreign
currency, Minister of Industry and Commerce Nathan Shamuyarira has said.
</P>
<P>
The Board of Airline Representatives confirmed Wednesday its decision
to quote air fares on domestic, regional and international routes in U.S.
Dollars, saying the move was meant to stabilize operations and avert
frequent increases, the daily Herald reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The government's intervention means all airlines operating from
Zimbabwe which had started to quote their fares in U.S. Dollars have to
revert to the old system of charging their clients in local currency.
</P>
<P>
Shamuyarira Thursday told the Herald that Zimbabwean laws categorically
barred all transactions from being done in foreign currency and that all
airlines wishing to continue operating in the country had to abide by the
law and use local currency.
</P>
<P>
"According to the laws of Zimbabwe, the Zimbabwean Dollar is the legal
tender for all transactions of goods and services in the country. If the
airlines want to keep flying, they should continue to quote their fares in
Zimbabwean Dollars," he said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that by quoting fares in U.S. Dollars, fares were going
to almost double and go beyond the reach of ordinary Zimbabweans, although
special discounted fares were still going to be offered until March.

<HEADLINE> Pierce, Schnyder to Meet in Hardcourt Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Mary Pierce of France
will meet second seed Patty Schnyder in Saturday's final of the
165,000 U.S.dollar Australian Women's Hardcourt Championships at
Gold Coast, Australia.
</P>
<P>
The world No.7 beat Romanian Irina Spirlea 4-6, 6-4, 6-1 and
will meet second seed Patty Schnyder in the final.
</P>
<P>
Schnyder of Switzerland defeated defending champion Ai
Sugiyama of Japan 6-2, 7-6 (7-5) for the chance to win her sixth
Women's Tennis Association title.
</P>
<P>
Pierce looked in trouble early against world No.15 Spirlea who
was let down with crucial double faults and 43 unforced errors.
</P>
<P>
In the first set Spirlea broke Pierce in her initial service
game but the Frenchwoman broke back in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian then broke her opponent's usual pin-point serve
in the fifth game to win the set.
</P>
<P>
The second set went to serve until the ninth game when Pierce
broke and in the final set she stepped up a gear to win the match.
</P>
<P>
After the match Pierce said Spirlea was too good for her in
the first set.
</P>
<P>
Schnyder's defeat of Sugiyama was the worst result for the
diminutive Japanese who came second at the Hope Island Tennis
Club in 1997 and won in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Sugiyama played her usual consistent baseline game in the
first set but was no match for Schnyder's left hand curling
serves.
</P>
<P>
In the second, Sugiyama broke in the 11th game but Schnyder
broke back in the 12th to leave a tie-break to decide the set.
</P>
<P>
Sugiyama was up 4-2 in the tie-break but a dubious line call
gave her a double fault and allowed Schnyder back in to win the
match.
</P>
<P>
In the doubles final, American Corina Morariu and Larissa
Neiland of Latvia will meet Australian Kristine Kunce and
Spirlea.

<HEADLINE> Passengers, Cargo transport of Vietnam Airlines Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Passengers and cargo transport of
Vietnam Airlines decreased sharply in 1998, Vietnam's English
daily The Saigon Times Daily reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam Airlines carried about 2.48 million passengers in 1998,
compared with the previous year's 2.593 million, the daily quoted
a report from the carrier's corporate affairs office as saying.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 figure includes 900,000 foreigners, 85,337 fewer than
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Cargo transport was 40,300 tons, including 15,600 tons on
international routes, much lower than 1997's figure of 45,239
tons.
</P>
<P>
Dao Manh Nhuong, director of Vietnam Airlines, told the paper
earlier this week that management had not yet finalized the 1998
balance sheet, but the drop in passenger numbers and the
depreciation of the Vietnamese dong against the U.S. dollar meant
higher losses for last year compared with 1997's 36 billion
Vietnamese dong (around 3 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Last year saw Vietnam Airlines cut out many local and
international services and reduce the frequency of flights on
others.

MANILA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and the
Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) have agreed to resume their
formal peace talks in the first week of February, a senior
official said here Friday.

In a radio interview, National Security Adviser Alexander
Aguirre said the agreement was reached during an informal meeting
between the chairmen of the government and MILF panels Thursday.

<P>
"It was a very positive informal meeting in order to set the
schedule of the peace negotiations sometime in the first week of
February, and we believe that this is a positive sign that the
peace talks will be continued well on both sides," he said.
</P>
<P>
The 1,200-strong MILF, the major rebel group based in Mindanao,
is fighting for an independent Muslim state in the southern
Philippines.
</P>

Although the government and the MILF started peace talks a year

<HEADLINE> Turkey Bans Forced Virginity Testing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Minister of Justice
Hasan Denizkurdu has issued a decree to stop the practice of
forced gynecological exams to determine if women and girls are
virgins.
</P>
<P>
Local Daily News Friday quoted Denizkurdu as saying that girls
in state orphanages, prisoners and sometimes even foreign
tourists staying in hotel rooms with male companions have been
subjected to gynecological tests against their will.
</P>
<P>
He said that the exams "hurt the dignity, modesty and
feelings" of women, adding that the exams can only be required by
a judge if such tests are required as evidence in criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
While human rights groups have long denounced the practice,
many conservative Turkish families defend the tests as a way of
deterring girls from straying and damaging marriage prospects.
</P>
<P>
In some more traditional regions of Turkey, it is hard for
women to travel alone with male friends.
</P>
<P>
In Turkey, women wear red ribbons on their wedding gowns to
signal their virginity.
</P>
<P>
Hotel management can demand proof of marriage from couples
before giving them rooms. In most cases, hotel management would
complain to police who would then take the women away to have the
medical exams performed by medical staff.
</P>
<P>
In one reported case, a German journalist was forced to
undergo a medical test to determine whether she had had sexual
intercourse while staying at a hotel with a male friend.

COLOMBO, January 8 (Xinhua) -- At least 10 Tamil rebels were
killed Thursday by Sri Lankan government troops in separate
clashes in Northern province of the country, a military spokesman
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Ink Dewage said that during daytime Thursday in the
northwest of Oddusudan, government troops operating forward of
defenses sniped at and killed four Tamil rebels.
</P>
<P>
Around 10:30 a.m. Thursday at Paranthan, troops conducted a
limited operation and confronted a group of rebels. The troops
confirmed that four rebels were also killed during the
confrontation, he said.
</P>
<P>
In another incident around 11:15 a.m. Thursday at Paranthan,
Dewage said, government troops operating forward defenses killed
two more rebels.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday morning, at the sea off Mullaitivu, a Sri Lankan
naval craft on offensive patrol detected a rebel vessel and
engaged it with heavy naval weapons, Dewage said. The navy
confirmed that the rebel craft was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil rebels have been fighting a war against the
government since 1983 for a separate state in the north and east
of the island country.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan MPs to Summon Vice President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KAMPALA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Uganda's parliamentary standing
committee on national economy has resolved to summon Vice President
Specioza Kazibwe and two ministers over the stalled Budget Bill.
</P>
<P>
The committee, chaired by Isaac Isanga Musumba, made the decision
Thursday, the New Vision daily reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said the vice president, Finance Minister Gerald Ssendaula and
Parliamentary Affairs Minister Martin Aliker should appear before the
committee next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kagole Kivumbi, spokesman to Parliament, told Xinhua in a telephone
interview Friday morning that it is a normal thing for ministers to appear
before committees.
</P>
<P>
"It's normal. It's not a disgrace for the person to be summoned. The
ministers have the duty to explain to parliamentary committees. The only
person who cannot be summoned is the President," Kivumbi said.
</P>
<P>
The MPs are opposed to the current practice whereby the government
presents a final budget and merely asks for parliamentary approval.
</P>
<P>
Kazibwe and the ministers are to explain why the Budget Bill has not
yet been tabled to the House.
</P>
<P>
Kazibwe is reportedly to appear in her capacity as the leader of
government business in parliament. Thursday's summon by the MPs is the
second for Kazibwe in less than a week.
</P>
<P>
She is scheduled to appear before the select committee on agriculture
Tuesday over her role in the valley dams saga in which millions of U.S.
Dollars earmarked for building valley dams was missing.
</P>
<P>
Kazibwe, who is also the Minister of Agriculture, is allegedly
responsible for the mismanagement of the the valley dam fund.

<P>
JERUSALEM, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Labor legislator Shimon Peres, who met with Palestinian
National Authority President Yasser Arafat Thursday, said Arafat
told him he would not declare a Palestinian state if the stalled
peace process was renewed. With the election campaign likely to
delay progress on the peace front until after the May 17
election, the May 4 deadline will almost certainly be missed.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has announced that he
plans to raise this year's inflation target from the original 4
percent to 5 or 6 percent prior to the elections. Central bank
officials warned that this move would hurt Israel's standing on
world markets, undermine the public faith in government economic
policy and cause inflation to rise.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The main political parties have stepped up their attacks
against each other. The Likud made public its campaign strategies
Thursday, which included harsh criticism of Labor Party leader
Ehud Barak and intentionally ignored all other candidates,
especially Amnon Lipkin-Shahak. Barak said Hamas leader Sheikh
Ahmed Yassin owes his freedom to Netanyahu personally and likes
his government.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to start AIDS Education in School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government will soon start an
education campaign against AIDS in schools across the country, Xinhua
learned here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan Ministry of Health said students, teachers and parents will,
beginning next month, be shown films and given lectures on the disease.
</P>
<P>
The program, funded by the World Bank, will also involve financing drama,
poetry and song competition on HIV/AIDS at the grass-root level.
</P>
<P>
More than 1.5 million Kenyans have contracted the AIDS virus since 1980,
and over half a million of these victims have died, according to sources
from the Health Ministry.
</P>
<P>
A number of AIDS cases have been reported in Kenyan secondary schools
and colleges, long thought to be free of the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
According to Director Julius Meme of Medical Services under the ministry,
the campaign will be centered at the district level and be coordinated by
district medical officials in collaboration with inter-sectoral AIDS
committee. The ministry has already allocated 35 million Shillings (some
0.6 million U.S. Dollars) to all districts in readiness for the campaign,
Meme noted. "It is anticipated that the school programs will augment
community AIDS education program," Meme said, adding that the ministry
wanted to ensure that 70 percent of students in final year are able to
cite at least two ways of preventing HIV/AIDS.

<HEADLINE> Rafter Knocked out of Championships in Adelaide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Dual U.S. Open champion
Patrick Rafter was knocked out of the Adelaide Men's Hardcourt
Championships in the second round in Adelaide, Australia, on
Friday in a shock upset by Czech veteran Slava Dosedel.
</P>
<P>
Dosedel, ranked 64th in the world, eliminated the world No.4
7-5, 6-4 in a match postponed from last night because of rain.
</P>
<P>
Rafter said he felt sluggish on court and was lacking
motivation after two hard years on the ATP tour and needed some
good wins to gain confidence going into the Australian Open.
</P>
<P>
"I was a little sluggish out there, when I'm not moving well I
don't play well," he told the Australian Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
"He (Dosedel) played well and he deserved the luck. He has
obviously been doing a lot more work than I have."
</P>
<P>
But Rafter said the nagging left knee injury which forced him
to take a two month break at the end of last year had fully
healed.
</P>
<P>
Dosedel said he was pleased with his solid game because he
didn't allow Rafter a chance to break back in either set.
</P>
<P>
"It was a good start to the year for me to beat a top 10
player," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Adelaide teenager Lleyton Hewitt has taken the next
step towards defending his title by advancing to the
quarter-finals with a three sets victory over Jiri Novak, also of
the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old Hewitt, who was 3-2 up in the final set when
rain interrupted play last night, took the game 7-6 (7-2), 2-6,
6-4 when play resumed Friday.
</P>
<P>
Hewitt, ranked 100th, said there was a lot more pressure on
him this year compared with last year when he stunned the tennis
world by winning the tournament, then named the Australian Men's
Hardcourt.
</P>
<P>
"I could go out there and no one knew me last year and this
year, you're sort of a marked man," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hewitt became the fourth Australian to advance to a
quarter-finals, and will play Dosedel Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Scott Draper and Michael Tebbutt are battling for a berth in
the final four, while Jason Stoltenberg will meet Zimbabwean
Byron Black and Swede Thomas Enqvist will play Slovakian Dominik
Hrbaty.

<HEADLINE> Lack of Funds Hampers AIDS Education in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Lack of funds, textbooks and
teachers has prevented Tanzania from effectively carrying out AIDS
education among students, an official with the Ministry of Education and
Culture has said.
</P>
<P>
M. Sawaya, a coordinator of School AIDS Education Program of the
ministry, was quoted by Friday's Daily Mail as saying that the curriculum
on AIDS was started in 1990 but was not materialized until last year due to
financial constraints.
</P>
<P>
Other obstacles to AIDS education are absence of teachers who have
special knowledge on AIDS and textbooks on the deadly disease, the official
revealed to the paper Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In Tanzania, education programs on AIDS, HIV and Sexually Transmitted
Diseases (STDs) are implemented in primary schools, secondary schools as
well as teaching training colleges.
</P>
<P>
The National AIDS Control Program (NACP) said it hoped HIV/AIDS
transmission could be curbed by giving education to as many people as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics indicated that in Tanzania, which has a population
of 32 million, around 520,000 people have been infected with AIDS while a
total of 1.5 million are carriers of HIV virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The government said AIDS cases are still increasing at an alarming rate.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Market lots for Homes in West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Housing Ministry is to
market lots in the Palestinian territories for building 3,729
residential units, according to a ministry document carried by
the local paper Ha'aretz Friday.
</P>
<P>
The document said that another 1,320 lots are to be made
available at the politically controversial site of Har Homa in
southern Jerusalem, on top of the 1,000 recently put on the
market there after a year's freeze.
</P>
<P>
The tenders to be issued for lots in West Bank
settlements include 500 units in Ariel, 500 in Alfei Menash
and 400 in the ultra-orthodox Emanuel.
</P>
<P>
In the areas near Jerusalem, the program includes the
construction of 811 homes in Givat Ze'ev, 636 in the
ultra-orthodox Betar, 600 in Ma'akeh Adumim, 182 in Adam and
100 at Efrat. Another 404 apartment units are slated for
settlement of Tsur Bahe, near Bethlehem, but political objections
may delay this project.
</P>
<P>
Of the lots on the market in 1999, the document added,
19.3 percent are earmarked for the orthodox and ultra-orthodox
communities, down from 21.7 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Based on this partial program, which does not include
projects of the Israel Lands Administration (ILA), and on
statements made by ILA, the Housing Ministry and the ILA will
not meet the government's quota of 60,000 residential units for
1999.
</P>
<P>
The Housing Ministry generally markets downscale housing, much
of it in areas remote from the center of Israel, while the
ILA deals mostly with more prestigious sites such as Tel Aviv
and other cities.

<P>
LUSAKA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba said
there was no consensus for a cease-fire in the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) conflict, but he was optimistic that talks planned for next week in
Lusaka would be fruitful.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba was speaking Thursday after a two-hour meeting with Rwandan
President Pasteur Bizimungu and Vice President and Defense Minister Major
General Paul Kagame in the Rwandan capital Kigali.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail Friday quoted Chiluba as saying "Up to now the dialog
is promising and is continuing. Our intention is to see peace restored in
Congo."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bizimungu described the talks with Chiluba as "very
interesting."
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, who now travels to Uganda, is considered neutral in the multi-
national war in Congo and is spearheading efforts under the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) to promote a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda and Uganda are providing military backing to Congolese rebels
who began a campaign to oust President Laurent Kabila last August.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad are supporting Congolese government
forces.
</P>
<P>
A regional summit on peace in the DRC which had been scheduled for last
month was postponed for three times because Kabila refused to have direct
talks with the rebels. It is now due to take place from January 12 to 15.
and now Kabila proposed to meet the rebels in Kinshasa.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Economic Growth Distressed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Contrary to official estimates that show
the Kenyan economy grew at 1.6 percent in 1998, the Economist Intelligence
Unit said productive activities rose only by a distressing one percent, a
statistic which will marginally improve to 1.6 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
In its latest country report on Kenya, the technical arm of the Britain-
based Economist magazine noted that after a year in which poor weather and
economic mismanagement conspired to produce a severe downturn in most
sectors, "indications are that 1999 will see a modest recovery to 1.6
percent real growth."
</P>
<P>
The People newspaper Friday quoted the report as saying that the
spending cutbacks and victory over the teachers' strike last year have put
the government in a stronger position to achieve its target of a balanced
budget.
</P>
<P>
Despite the regime's failure to deal with all of the International
Monetary Fund governance demands, the fund appears set to re-establish
lending toward the middle of this year.
</P>
<P>
"Into 1999, the continued depressed growth of coffee, sugar, tourism and
manufacturing will hinder any significant recovery until later in the year,
despite lower interest rates. Thus, we are forecasting real GDP growth of
no more than 1.6 percent in 1999, but growth will continue to recover,
albeit slowly, to two percent in 2000," said the report.
</P>
<P>
The report estimated that agriculture in Kenya grew negatively to -0.2
percent last year from 1.2 percent in 1997 and is expected to grow to 1.4
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing sector grew by 1.5 percent in 1998, down from 1.9 percent
in 1997 and will grow by three percent this year and 3.5 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Services sector dropped from 2.9 percent in 1997 to 1.3 percent in 1998
and will improve marginally to 1.6 percent this year.

million yuan during the 1996-1998 period on the project in 35
state-designated poverty-stricken counties.
</P>
<P>
By the end of July, 1998, Shanxi had added 282 primary schools
with a total of 21,000 square meters of floor space, and had impro
ved facilities at 164 schools, and given training courses to
46,000 teachers.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi was able to do this because its plan for implementing
the compulsory education project has given priority to primary
schools, rural areas, and construction of schools.

<HEADLINE> Euro  Makes Debut in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LUSAKA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- A number of commercial banks in Zambia
are taking measures to smooth transactions in Euro, the new European
currency launched eight days ago.
</P>
<P>
Some commercial banks including Barclays Bank and Standard Chartered
bank in Lusaka have already started displaying exchange rates of the Kwacha,
 Zambian currency, against the Euro.
</P>
<P>
Some banks have not started transaction in the Euro, saying they want
to gather more details about the new currency before dealing it in their
foreign exchange trade.
</P>
<P>
Barclays Bank chief dealer Wise Silumbu was quoted by Friday's Zambia
Daily Mail as saying that the bank's policy is to keep in step with the
changing international financial and economic circumstances and has
therefore taken measures to ensure that transactions involving the major
currencies including Euro are facilitated by the bank as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
"We are not an island and therefore always endeavor to provide all the
necessary services to our clients at all times for their convenience," he
said.
</P>
<P>
At Indo-Zambia Bank, however, the Euro transaction has not been
conducted as management adopted a "wait and see" approach.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange manager of the bank Shukla Satish said the bank will
begin transacting in the currency only after gathering more concrete data
on it.

<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-four professors at East
China Teachers' University's college of science and engineering
recently had to fill in forms to answer questions about their own
views of their teaching and scientific research ability, work
load, and achievements, according to today's Wenhui Daily.
</P>
<P>
After filling in the forms, they were subject to a ten-minute
examination process organized by academic authorities who will
decide whether or not to hire them, based on the assessment
results, said the Shanghai-based newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Those who are found to be unqualified will be asked to improve
their work and academic performance, while those who are found to
be capable will be given a 200 yuan (24 U.S. dollars) monthly
stipend.
</P>
<P>
One 50-year-old mathematics professor, Chen Zhijie, said that
this was the first time he had ever been asked to take part in

<HEADLINE> German FM: Hungary's Accession to EU Far Too Early </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Visiting German Foreign
Minister Joschka Fischer said here Thursday that it is still too
early to consider a specific timetable for Hungary's entry to the
European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference following talks with his
Hungarian counterpart Martony Janos, Fischer said Germany hoped
that Hungary would be able to enter the EU as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said European integration was the only option for the
European countries. In the post-Cold War era, the EU should no
longer rest its eyes on the west. The EU's eastward expansion is
also in the German interests.
</P>
<P>
However, he said it was impractical to discuss Hungary's entry
time now. The EU would finalize the earliest date for the EU
expansion by the end of the year or the beginning of next year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the accession negotiations with the six countries
aspiring for EU membership including Hungary, Fischer said
Germany, which assumed the EU presidency in the first half of
1999, would honor its obligations for the implementation of the
EU expansion process.
</P>
<P>
He said that, by the end of July, 15 of the 31 points involved
in the negotiations would be put on the agenda. He reiterated
that the precondition for the EU expansion was the fulfillment of
the organization's internal reforms.
</P>
<P>
The EU planned to complete its Agenda 2000 for its internal
reforms by the end of March, which the German foreign minister
said, would require the related countries to make concessions for
the elimination of the EU's internal differences. It would be a
hard nut to crack, he added.
</P>
<P>
Martony believed that the EU would be able to reach agreement
on the Agenda 2000. He said the launch of the single European
currency - the euro would accelerate the elimination of the i
nternal differences for all differences would manifest themselves
through the euro.
</P>
<P>
Fischer, who arrived here Thursday on a one-day visit to
Budapest, also held separate talks with Hungarian President Goncz
Arpad and Prime Minister Orban Viktor.
</P>
<P>
Hungary, in its bid for entry to EU, has repeatedly pledged
that it would meet the criteria for EU accession by 2000 and
hoped that it would become a full EU member in 2002.
</P>
<P>
Some EU member states including Germany, however, opposed to
any rush in the expansion drive. They insisted that the accession
issue would not be raised for deliberations until the winding up
of the EU internal reforms and the first candidates would not be
admitted prior to 2006.

<HEADLINE> Viagra Undergoing Clinical Trial in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 8 (Xinhua) -- China's drug administration
is conducting clinical experiment on Viagra, whose fate in China
will be decided later this year, when the results of the study
are released.
</P>
<P>
Seven hospitals in the cities of Beijing, Shanghai, and Wuhan
are trying it out on about 600 male volunteers, Guangzhou's
"Yangcheng Evening News" reports. It quotes a State Drug
Administration official as saying that the results will partly
decide whether Pfizer, the American manufacturer of Viagra, is
allowed to sell the little blue pill in China.
</P>
<P>
Strict clinical tests have to be done, but the government
department still has the final say, the newspaper says. The
volunteers are married males above the age of 22 who have shown
been sick for at least six months, it says, suggesting that the
illness was impotence. They have already been given the medicine
or a placebo and have recorded relevant data and personal
feelings every day for a two-month period.
</P>
<P>
Viagra still does not have an official Chinese name in China,
but the media and black marketers are using the word "weige", a
term coined in Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Australia Launches Ambitious Tourism Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- An ambitious 150 million
Australian dollar (94.5 million U.S. dollars) tourism campaign
estimated to reach 300 million people over the next three years
was launched by the Australian Tourism Commission Friday.
</P>
<P>
The campaign focuses on five key tourism markets, and it
represents Australia's largest ever overseas tourism push, bigger
than the famous "put a shrimp on the barbie" ads featuring Paul
Hogan in 1984.
</P>
<P>
Federal Tourism Minister Jackie Kelly said in a statement that
she was confident the advertising campaign would take the number
of overseas tourists visiting Australia to more than five million
in 2001, up from 4.1 million last year.
</P>
<P>
She said the advertisements showed the irreverent, humorous
side of Australians, while highlighting traditional tourist
attractions such as beaches and koalas.
</P>
<P>
"The optimistic, colorful and welcoming personality of
Australia is what sets us apart from other countries - it's our
product differentiation," she said.
</P>
<P>
In ad-speak, the promotion is called the Brand Australia
Millennium Campaign.
</P>
<P>
It has separate campaigns for each of Australia's five major
tourism markets - Japan, North America, New Zealand, Europe and
Asia.

<HEADLINE> Defalcation of 10.3 Mln Dollars from Bank Detected in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Embezzlement of over 500 million
taka (about 10.3 million U.S. dollars) from branches of a
Bangladesh bank has been detected, an English daily newspaper
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Several businessmen, including a former parliament member in
connivance with some officers and employees of the Rupali Bank,
misappropriated the huge amount of money from the bank's nine
branches, The Independent quoted an officer of the bank, who was
entrusted with the responsibility of investigation, as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was revealed in the course of investigation
that some businessmen opened accounts in their own names, fake
names or the names of their minor children with those nine
branches and misappropriated the money.
</P>
<P>
Some officers of the bank kept as pledge the deeds of their own
movable and immovable property in favor of those businessmen and
helped them to misappropriate the amount, he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, 15 cases were filed against 19 accused persons for
their alleged involvement in the misappropriation and the
connected files were sent to the head office, and those files were
said to have been missing from there.
</P>
<P>
The records of such 32 accounts have been seized for scrutiny
by an order of the district and sessions judge.
</P>
<P>
The case is being further investigated.

<P>
HARBIN, January 8 (Xinhua) -- A person can now open a safe
without a key or a fingerprint in just four seconds merely by
appearing in front of a new "intelligent" safe that was developed
at China's Harbin Engineering University.
</P>
<P>
The head of the design group, Yin Zhenliang, says that it is
much safer than conventional safes and the owner no longer need
worry about losing a key or forgetting a digital sequence, and it
is suitable for banks and national defense or public security
offices.
</P>
<P>
A small computer and video camera in the safe identify the
owner and take a photo of any unwelcome visitor.
</P>
<P>
It takes a technician about two hours to install. If the safe
gets a new owner, technicians can open it with the help of the
previous owner and add the image of the new owner. And, if an
intruder tries to open the safe, it can emit a loud alarm that
can be wired to security services.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The earth of the plain around
Beijing has been sinking over the past decade, mainly because of
the excessive use of subterranean water.
</P>
<P>
The village of Zhaocun in suburban Daxing County, the
Dongsanqi area in Changping County and the southern part of
Shunyi County have suffered the most, with a maximum drop of 363
millimeters.
</P>
<P>
The subsidence has caused damage to some underground
facilities, breaking pipes and other structures.
</P>
<P>
It has been attributed to the excessive development of
subterranean water, that reaches some 200 million cubic meters
each year.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has over 10 million people, but its per capita water
resources are only about 300 cubic meters, or only 15 percent of
the country's average and 4 percent of the world's average.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government is looking for ways to restrict the
use of groundwater.

<P>
 Local officials say that this growth came from an increase
in the variety and the speed of transport. Beijing has more than
20,000 farmers in suburban areas growing vegetables for export on
more than 13,000 hectares of land.
</P>
<P>
 The exports have also accelerated the process of
industrialization in rural areas and the growth of companies that
specialize in vegetable processing.

<HEADLINE> Investments in Bangladesh's Two EPZs Rise to 320.2 Mln Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The investments in Bangladesh's
Dhaka and Chittagong export processing zones (EPZs) rose to about
320.2 million U.S. dollars in the last two fiscal years against
cumulative investments of 197.5 million dollars in the previous 13
years till the 1995-96 fiscal year, The Financial Express daily
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The statistics were revealed at the 16th governors' meeting of
the Bangladesh Export Processing Zone Authority (BEPZA) held here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In the 1997-98 fiscal year, the volume of export by the BEPZA
stood at 636 million dollars, up by about 89 percent over the
previous fiscal year's 337 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The total employment in the two EPZs rose by 76 percent to
76,000 from 43,183 two years ago, and besides, after the
completion of 28 more industries in the two EPZs, employment will
be created for an additional 17,200 people and investment would
increase by another 76 million dollars, according to BEPZA
sources.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Committee of the National Economic Council has
approved two more EPZs in view of the growing interests of
investors in setting up industrial units in EPZs.

<HEADLINE> Warriors Talking with Several Teams about Sprewell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The NBA lockout may be
settled, but the Golden State Warriors still have a dilemma --
Latrell Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
Garry St. Jean, the team's general manager, is looking to
trade Sprewell as quickly as possible and confirmed talks with
several teams around the league.
</P>
<P>
"We haven't hit the fact that we're going to make a deal as
fast as we can for Latrell," he said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The team hopes to get at least two quality players for
Sprewell, who choked Warriors coach P.J. Carlesimo during a
practice session on December 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Warriors immediately terminated the remainder of
Sprewell's three-year contract, worth as much as $24 million, and
the league imposed a one-year suspension.
</P>
<P>
But an arbitrator later reinstated Sprewell to the team and
cut his suspension to the 68 remaining games of the 1997-98
season.
</P>
<P>
"When we do get two people to come in, they're not going to be
the 11th and 12th guys on the roster," St. Jean said. "We think
they're going to be guys who can play, guys that have good
careers, and have been with good teams. We're going to feel good
about it."
</P>
<P>
Carlesimo downplayed the choking incident when asked if there
was a chance of keeping the three-time All-Star, he said, "I
think anything is possible, but it would be difficult."
</P>
<P>
The Warriors' other concern is signing Antawn Jamison, the
North Carolina forward they acquired with a draft-day trade.
Carlesimo hopes Jamison can help the team turn around its 19-63
record last season.

<HEADLINE> Thais Get Warning to Reduce Water Usage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Metropolitan Waterworks
Authority (MWA) of Thailand will start reducing water volume
released for public consumption by up to 15 percent this month
while officials are kicking off national water-saving campaign to
prepare the country for what is expected to be the worst shortage
in years, The Nation reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ultimate warnings have also been given against Thais' luxurious
water consumption habits, as the reserve in the country's biggest
dam, Bhumibol, has already shrunk to a 35-year low, with the rainy
season still more than half a year away.
</P>
<P>
The Irrigation Department chief Pramote Maiklad, Thursday
repeated his plea for Thais to reduce their water usage by 20 to
30 percent, and complained that authorities' failure to persuade
farmers to reduce second-crop rice cultivation this year is
seriously aggravating the problem.
</P>
<P>
The two dams -- Bhumibol and Sirikit -- now have 3,800 million
cubic meters in reserve, compared to 7,000 to 8,000 million cubic
meters around the same period last year. And the reserves are
dwindling faster than expected.
</P>
<P>
The Irrigation Department had hoped to see second-crop rice
cover 1.9 million rai (304,000 hectares) maximum, but a latest
survey has found the second-crop rice area expanding beyond 2.5
million rai (400.000 hectares).
</P>
<P>
The issue of second-crop rice is sensitive, as it involves poor
farmers. Critics have noted that no firm austerity action has been
taken when it comes to electricity production and tap water
consumption of people in cities. However, the MWA will this month
start reducing water released for public consumption by between
10-15 percent. The reduction, the authority said, would not really
affect Bangkok users if they change their habits which have
resulted in a waste of more than 20 percent of tap water released.
</P>
<P>
At the Bhumibol Dam, strict rules have been introduced to
control the daily release of water. Dam director Kamthon Tikamol
discovered to his dismay Thursday morning that the water level now
stood at 1,386 million cubic meters, compared with 3,314 million
cubic meters the same day last year.
</P>
<P>
People in some provinces have begun to feel the pinch. In
Chiang Mai, northern Thailand, taps have occasionally run dry.
</P>
<P>
Coffee growers in Chumphon province have seen their produce
dwindle by more than 40 percent because of drought. In Khon Kaen
province, about half the province's 2,015 villages are in need of
water.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Companies Work on High Speed Internet Access Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Two U.S. technology
companies announced Thursday that they intend to work with AT&AMP;T
on a new Internet protocol network.
</P>
<P>
The high-speed network, they said, will enable AT&AMP;T to offer
services such as data, voice and video over the hybrid fiber
co-axial network currently developed by AT&AMP;T and TCI, both
providers of telecommunications services. AT&AMP;T customers will be
able to simultaneously watch television, send and receive faxes,
log on to the Internet and talk on the telephone.
</P>
<P>
The plan of combining broadband Internet, phone and video
services over a single cable line was proposed by Cisco, a
worldwide leader in networking for the Internet, and General
Instrument, a worldwide provider of integrated and interactive br
oadband access solutions.
</P>
<P>
According to Cisco, the collaboration will result in a new
world network that will fundamentally change the way
communication services are delivered to the consumer market. It
would be a major step toward implementing future integrated data,
voice and video telecommunications on a mass-market scale.
</P>
<P>
The companies said they will conduct a market trial starting
in late 1999, with the goal of providing commercial availability
by next year.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Cisco also announce Thursday that
along with its partners in the consumer electronics world, it
will begin selling cable modems that offer high-speed data, voice
and video connections. The networking company also announced
integrated products capable of creating home networks.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, a study conducted by research firm Yankee
Group showed that more and more American households are keen on
home networks. This bodes well for the makers of such networking
products such as Cisco.
</P>
<P>
With the same Cisco technology that underpins vast corporate
networks, families will soon be able to create local area
networks connecting the kitchen to the living room.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Initiates Primary Education Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Reforms in primary education are
implemented in Sri Lanka's state schools from Friday, which aim at
identifying each child as an individual to introduce them to the
formal educational system to suit their own individuality.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga said in a statement
that the reforms would bring about changes in developing mental
abilities, general basic abilities and healthy attitudes and
values in children.
</P>
<P>
Teachers have already been trained to be creative in order to
implement the reforms. They are expected to monitor the
performance of the children both individually and collectively in
games and other activities, Education Ministry sources said.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen games have been identified to suit the grade 1
children. The teachers will observe the students and identify
their skills competencies and behavioral patterns when they
participate in these games. It will also enable the teacher to
identify mental and physical strengths of the children.
</P>
<P>
In a fact finding mission it was found that by using
environment successfully teachers had managed to create learning
situations and environmental friendly attitudes and arouse
curiosity among the children.
</P>
<P>
The new curriculum comprises language, religion, mathematics
and environment based activities. It is a competency based
curriculum with a mixture of knowledge, competencies, attitudes
and values.
</P>
<P>
The new reforms envisage employing one teacher for two years at
one key stage. This is expected to make it easier for the teacher
to help the children to master competencies in learning.

<P>
PONGYANG, JANUARY 8 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) has demanded that the United States pay
compensation for the economic losses caused by its delay in
implementing a 1994 nuclear framework agreement.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK Anti-Nuclear and Peace Committee issued a statement
on Thursday, saying it had implemented the accord by freezing its
nuclear development program, but the United States had violated
the agreement by building light-water reactors.
</P>
<P>
Due to its delay in implementing the accord, the United States
had caused economic losses valued at tens of billions of dollars
to the country, the committee said.
</P>
<P>
The delay also caused an acute shortage of energy and badly
affected the country's planned economy, it noted.
</P>
<P>
"Thus the United States has the obligation and responsibility
to make compensation for the economic losses," the committee
emphasized in the statement.
</P>
<P>
The committee also attributed the current hardships
experienced by its people to anti-DKPK policies of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
In conclusion, it warned the United States, South Korea and
Japan to abide by the Geneva nuclear agreement.

<HEADLINE> German FM: Hungary's Accession to EU Too Early </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Visiting German Foreign
Minister Joschka Fischer said here Thursday that it is still too
early to consider a specific timetable for Hungary's entry into
the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Following talks with his Hungarian counterpart Martony Janos,
Fischer said Germany hopes that Hungary would be able to enter
the EU as soon as possible. But that also presupposes the EU's
completion of its internal reforms and Hungary's ability to meet
with admission conditions, he added.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said European integration is the only option for
European countries. In the post cold war era, the EU should not
rest its eyes on the West. The EU's eastward expansion is also in
Germany's interests.
</P>
<P>
He said the EU would finalize the earliest date for EU
expansion by the end of the year or the beginning of next year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the accession negotiations with the six countries
aspiring for EU membership, including Hungary, Fischer said
Germany, which assumed the EU presidency in the first half of
1999, would honor its obligations for the implementation of the
EU expansion process.
</P>
<P>
He said that by the end of July, 15 of 31 questions involved
in the negotiations would be put on the agenda. He reiterated
that the precondition for EU expansion is the fulfillment of the
organization's internal reforms.
</P>
<P>
The EU planned to complete its "Agenda 2000" for internal
reforms by the end of March, which the German foreign minister
said would require the related countries to also make certain
concessions.
</P>
<P>
Martony believes the EU would be able to reach agreement on
the Agenda 2000. He said the launch of the single European
currency -- the euro -- would accelerate the elimination of
internal differences, for all differences will manifest
themselves through the euro.
</P>
<P>
Fischer, who arrived here Thursday on a one-day visit to
Budapest, also held separate talks with Hungarian President Goncz
Arpad and Prime Minister Orban Viktor.
</P>
<P>
Hungary, in its bid for entry into EU, has repeatedly pledged
that it would meet the criteria for EU accession by 2000 and
hopes that it will become a full EU member in 2002.
</P>
<P>
However, some EU member states, including Germany, oppose a
rush in the expansion drive. They insist that the accession issue
not be raised for deliberations until the completion of EU
internal reforms and the first candidates not be admitted prior
to 2006.

<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The former deputy mayor of the
city of Guigang in China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has
gone on trial for bribery, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Li Chenglong, 46, was arrested on December 20, 1996 and
accused of taking 3.8 million yuan (457,800 U.S. dollars) in
bribes and accepting goods valued at 6.6 million yuan. In a
2-year investigation, local prosecutors found that, from 1991 to
1996, when Li was the municipal Party committee secretary in
Yulin, he accepted a large number of bribes for the random
appointment of officials and approved various businesses and
illegally sold blocks of land.
</P>
<P>
In one instance, Li appointed the manager of a cement company
to the post of assistant-mayor of Yulin, vice-chairman of its
political consultative conference and deputy director of its
enterprise committee in exchange for 700,000 yuan, prosecutors
say.
</P>
<P>
Other gifts included a jeep, they say. He was also discovered
to have covered for 2 unqualified department-level officials, and
to have illegally approved bank loans.

SOFIA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Exiled Bulgarian king Simeon II
said here Thursday that he is willing to resume his monarchy if
it is necessary.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody understands that I have been brought up to serve my
country and if one day it becomes necessary and if I am strong
enough, I will take up my place," Simeon II said.
</P>
<P>
Simeon II arrived here on December 22 with his wife and his
daughter on a third visit to Bulgaria following his return in
1996 and again in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he would return to Bulgaria for good, Simeon II
said, "If my long-term presence here is useful, not to divide
people, but to find ways to work in harmony with the government
and the authorities, it is good."
</P>
<P>
The royal family was forced to leave Bulgaria after the
eastern European country was declared a republic in 1946
following a referendum during which a majority of Bulgarians
favored the abolishment of the monarchy.
</P>
<P>
The former king said that some of the royal estates could be
used for cultural and environmental purposes and that he planned
more visits to the country in 1999.

JAKARTA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian police have revealed
that local government officials and councilors may have been
involved in recent unrest in various parts of the country, the

<P>
COLOMBO, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government will
spend 100 million rupees (1.5 million U.S. dollars) to establish
two new rice mills to process more rice, the official Daily News
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Cooperative Wholesale Establishment (CWE) S.P.
Chandradasa told the paper that the new mills in Kurunegala and
Anuradhapura districts will be funded by a donor with whom the
government is already in negotiation.
</P>
<P>
Two mills which were set up earlier at Lunugamvehera and
Hingurakgoda in North Central province were funded by the CWE and
have proved a success and can process two metric tons of rice an
hour, said the chairman.
</P>
<P>
Rice imports will be stopped in late January or early February
to accommodate the local paddy harvest, Chandradasa said, adding
that the CWE will effect purchases of the local crop through an
islandwide network of centers.
</P>
<P>
The CWE also has an unprocessed stock of 7000 tons of paddy
which has been purchased from farmers and which will be released

<HEADLINE> Three Thai Fishermen Held Hostage by Cambodians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 8 (Xinhua) -- A group of heavily-armed
Cambodians attacked two Thai fishing vessels and held three
crewmen hostage, the Bangkok Post said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred on Thursday night about six nautical
miles away from Kood island off the Thai Chanthaburi Province, the
newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
It was believed to be an act of revenge for the murder of three
Cambodian immigration officers on December 24 by fishermen of
unidentified nationalities, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The raiders also seized the two vessels.
</P>
<P>
The attack was reported to the Thai Navy's First Fleet, which
dispatched officials to hunt for the Cambodians.
</P>
<P>
During the hunt, the officials managed to rescue 15 Thai
crewmen on board one of the seized vessels.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodians escaped with the three hostages.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Thai National Carrier Set to Raise Air Fares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Thai Airways International
(THAI) will raise domestic fares by 13.5-13.7 percent under a
proposal by the Transport and Communications Ministry, aviation
sources said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The fare per flight will go up by about 200 baht (5.5 US
dollars), according to the proposal. But it did not say when.
</P>
<P>
THAI management will work out details and put them to the Civil
Aviation Board for approval, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Transport and Communications Minister Suthep Thueksuban has
said THAI domestic flights are cheap compared with those of
Indonesia and Malaysia. The operating cost for the first 100 km is
estimated at six baht/km per passenger but THAI charges passengers
about two baht/km.
</P>
<P>
The fare structure resulted in an annual operating loss of
1.7-2 billion baht (47 million to 55 million dollars), Suthep
said.
</P>
<P>
The carrier is also to cut costs because it cannot raise
domestic fares to break-even level, he said. THAI will have to
deploy aircraft in accordance with traffic demand.
</P>
<P>
Services on loss-making routes would continue until a private
sector operator was ready to take them over, Suthep said.
</P>
<P>
Suthep expected private airlines such as Bangkok Airways,
Orient Thai Airlines and Angel Airlines to raise their domestic
fares.

<P>
PANAMA CITY, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. armed forces
Thursday returned a military communications station to the
Panamanian government, the first piece of the canal land to go
back to the Latin American country this year in accordance with
the agreement signed between the two countries in 1977.
</P>
<P>
The Chivo Chivo Station, 21 kilometers north of the Panama
City, used to be the center for the U.S. Southern Command to
transfer military information in the Latin American region.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military will also return 115 hectares of barracks --
including the Rodman naval base, the Balboa shooting range, the
Sherman site, the Clayton site and the Howard air base -- will go
back to the Panama government in February.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1997 agreement, the United States is expected to
withdraw all its forces from the canal region by noon on December
31, 1999, and return the Panama Canal to the Panamanian
government.
</P>
<P>
So far, the United States has returned 70 percent of the land
in the canal region to Panama.

<HEADLINE> Brazil's Trade Deficit Down 23.2 Percent in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's total trade deficit
dropped 23.2 percent to 6.4 billion U.S. dollars in 1998 from 8.3
billion dollars in 1997, but largely exceeding government
expectation of 4 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Development, Industry and Commerce Ministry said Thursday
that exports totalled 51.1 billion dollars and imports amounted
to 57.5 billion dollars last year, dropping by 3.52 percent and
6.2 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
In December, the country's trade deficit reached 600 million
dollars, with exports worth 3.9 billion dollars and imports 4.5
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the trade deficit to the country's
economic crisis, adding that its goal was to double exports to
100 billion dollars in 2002.
</P>
<P>
However, economists believe that President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso faces his toughest challenge yet in his plan to slash its
huge budget deficit and shield Brazil from financial meltdown.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 40 billion dollars have flown out of Brazil since last
July for fears that the South American country could not cover
its budget deficit and might default on loans.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Myanmar Greens Arid Zone in Central Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Since 1992, Myanmar has been
implementing a greening and environmental project for the arid
zone in the central part of the country, aimed at systematic
conservation of forests to maintain sustainable yield of forest
products.
</P>
<P>
It initiated the greening projects in nine districts of the
arid zone in Mandalay, Sagaing and Magway divisions in the year
and planted more than 16 million trees including teak and hardwood
trees in areas of over 21,000 hectares, covering 57 townships and
15 mountain ranges between 1994 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
With the formation of a new arid region greening department
under the Ministry of Forestry in June 1997, the project began
expanding up to 13 districts, which includes the establishment of
nurseries, conservation of remaining natural forests, replacement
of fuel wood, restoration of watershed areas and establishment of
water resources.
</P>
<P>
The project covers a total area of 9.14 million hectares.
</P>
<P>
In addition to greening the region, the department also plans
to maintain the ecological system, meet basic requirements for
forest products and carry out socio-economic development for the
rural people.
</P>
<P>
It has also laid down work programs to establish 14,175
hectares of nurseries, conserve 40,500 hectares of natural forests
and plant trees on another area of 40,500 hectares annually.
</P>
<P>
It will also carry out greening projects in the tropical
region, Myingyan district and Mount Popa.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, from 1998 to 2001, the department will carry out
greening and environmental conservation projects in over 1.21
million hectares of reserved forests, over 3.24 million hectares
of non-reserved forests and over 3.64 million hectares of other
cultivated areas.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar promulgated the Forest Law in 1992 to effectively
conserve and preserve the forests which cover about 50 percent of
the total land area.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar's forestry rose 1.3
percent in its production in the 1997-98, accounting for 1 percent
of the country's gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
Of Myanmar's forest products, the production of teak was
283,000 cubic meters, while that of hardwood was 195,694 cubic
meters in the year.
</P>
<P>
The export quantity of the country's teak went to 215,448 cubic
meters, while that of hardwood stood at 142,915 cubic meters.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Rebels Optimistic About Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN, COLOMBIA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The
leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, on
Thursday expressed optimism about the peace process in the
country before starting their first peace talks with the
government in six years.
</P>
<P>
"We are optimistic concerning the new peace process, which
starts Thursday, where we will analyze the political, economic,
social, cultural, environmental, and sovereignty situation until
we find solutions," FARC chief Manuel Marulanda said in a
statement read by his representative Thursday for the opening of
the peace talks here.
</P>
<P>
Marulanda, who was scheduled to attend the opening ceremony,
did not appear due allegedly to security reasons.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Marulanda recalled the rebels' fight against
government forces during the past 35 years.
</P>
<P>
"The installation of dialogue tables for 90 days -- starting
from the military withdrawal-- to seek with social justice and
sovereignty a way out of the social and armed conflict, which has
been bleeding the country to death for more than four decades,
has prompted great expectations in the country and the world," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The rebel chief said the FARC was ready to hear and be heard,
adding that it would notify the news media of the results of the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Referring to drug-trafficking, Marulanda said, "It is
necessary that the powers make plans to eradicate coca and opium
poppy crops."
</P>
<P>
He said the planting of illegal crops by poor Colombian
farmers had deep, economic and social roots, and "should not be
treated in a repressive way."
</P>
<P>
Marulanda said he favored a more just society to end the
causes of violence.
</P>
<P>
The rebels will meet with the government in the Venezuelan
capital of Caracas and in the Mexican city of Tlaxcala, he said,
adding that this "proved FARC's political will to seek a
political solution to the conflict."
</P>
<P>
Marulanda called on all Colombians to strengthen their unity
around the 10-point rebel communique, which he said was the basis
for a political solution and for Colombia's reconciliation and
reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Marulanda's conditions for peace include the dismantling of
right-wing paramilitary groups and the exchange of 252 jailed
rebels for more than 350 police and soldiers captured since 1996.
He also seeks a redistribution of wealth in the long term.

this time before, but now I only have my woolen vest on."
</P>
<P>
It was widely believed earlier last year that it would be cold
this winter since the winters of the past several years were
warm. However, the reality is just the opposite, and it has been
as high as 19 and 20 degrees Centigrade during the past ten days
or so, quite a bit warmer than usual for winter here.
</P>
<P>
Song Dezhong, senior engineer with the Fujian Provincial
Meteorological Center, explained that the global warming is part
of the reason for the warm winter in Fuzhou. On the other hand,
the strong latitude circulation and the comparatively weak radial
circulation in the westerly belt this year has also played a part
in producing the abnormal temperatures, and a decrease in the
force of the cold air masses moving southward, and their
frequency, have also contributed to the warming trend.

MEXICO CITY, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Mexican government
Thursday again criticized the United States' annual unilateral
certification process, saying it has obstructed trust and
bilateral cooperation against drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recalled that
the Mexico-U.S. high-level anti-drug contact group had agreed
that drug trafficking was a multilateral problem, and that it
could only be eradicated by global measures based on respectful
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that during the group's latest meeting,
participants ratified their firm decision to eliminate distrust
in anti-drug actions and in combating money laundering.
</P>
<P>
It said that Mexico maintained technological development and
information exchange programs with other countries to fight drug
trafficking, including satellite monitoring of the destruction of
illegal drug plantations.
</P>
<P>
Fernando Solana, the president of the Senate Foreign Affairs
Committee, said the U.S. government should take its responsibi

</P>
<P>
Solana said that while 16,000 Mexican army troops were
assigned to destroy marijuana plantations, the planting and
harvesting of the weed has been legalized in several U.S.
states.

SHANGHAI, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The residents of the city of

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announces After-School Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Thursday that he hoped to devote 600 million U.S. dollars to
creating programs that would give thousands of American children
activities to do after school.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, the latest from Clinton's fiscal 2000 budget,
calls for three times the amount of money the federal government
now devotes to after-school programs. Clinton tied eligibility
for the program to his effort to halt "social promotions" that
move children up in the next grade even if they did not grasp
their lessons in the previous one.
</P>
<P>
"Our public schools must change," Clinton said. "Don't flunk
anybody because the system is failing the kids. Give them the
after-school programs. Give them the summer school programs. Give
them the tools they need to succeed."
</P>
<P>
Clinton unveiled the proposal in a ceremony in the White House
with the participation of his wife, Hillary, and Vice-President
Al Gore. It is among several policy initiatives that Clinton will
offer in his State of the Union address on January 19.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the budget he will send to Congress next month
will call for tripling the amount spent on the 21st Century
Learning Center Program, which provides public schools with money
for educational and recreational programs in the afternoon hours
when school is out but most working parents are still at their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
That program, currently funded at 200 million dollars, serves
190,000 children at 800 schools in 46 states and the District of
Columbia.

<HEADLINE> China Newspaper Warns Overseas Investors of Mistakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- A leading Chinese economic
newspaper has advised overseas investors to use world advanced
technology, adapt themselves to market changes, study the
regional differences in China's markets and hire first-class
management personnel to prevent losses when running businesses in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The China Economic Times said that although overseas ventures
in China may have great opportunities for being successful, some
have actually suffered losses due to making mistakes.
</P>
<P>
It cited examples in Shanghai where 47.35 percent of
overseas-invested companies reported losses in 1998. Overall
losses reached 3.9 billion yuan (about 488 million U.S. dollars).
Even four world famous ventures each reported a loss of more than
100 million yuan (about 12.5 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
"China's market is not what it used to be when the policy of
opening and reform first began," the business newspaper stressed.
"It is now requires the most advanced technological skills and is
more dynamic with lower prices creating fierce competition."
</P>
<P>
Products made with the world's most advanced technologies will
have more competitive advantages as the level of China's
technology is being upgraded very rapidly, and overseas investors
should constantly upgrade their products to meet the demands of
this fast changing market, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the newspaper said some investors have ignored
the huge regional differences in China.
</P>
<P>
"It would be very dangerous to use just one market strategy in
China," it said. "People in different parts of China have
different needs and business modes. The infrastructure conditions
and the role of government also vary from region to region."
</P>
<P>
Some companies operating at a loss had appointed managers
close to retiring age to run their firms, appointed inexperienced
'greenhorns' or people with little knowledge about China and its
language. They were thus unable to make contacts at the right
level with either superiors or local employees, the newspaper
declared.

HOHHOT, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Police in north China's Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region recently caught a computer hacker who
illegally accessed a local information service network.
</P>
<P>
The hacker, a 13-year-old middle school student, connected to
the local 169 information service network in the name of his
father and opened a main page called "Hacker" free of charge at
the website of Guangzhou in early October last year.
</P>
<P>
Later he entered a mail server by decoding, sent the "Hacker"
mainpage to a catalog in the mail server, and changed the codes,
thereby becoming able to control the work account of the managers
of the multi-media telecommunication system of Hohhot, capital of
the region.
</P>
<P>
The middle school student also threatened to turn the mainpage
of the 169 information service network into a hackers mainpage in
three days.
</P>
<P>
What the teenager did violated Chinese law but he was immune
to any legal action as he has not reached the age of 14. The
police ordered the parents to try and keep a closer watch on him
and encourage education on him.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Issues 1 Billion Dollars of Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
successfully launched 1 billion U.S. dollars of global bonds in
the international debt markets Thursday, reflecting the return of
investor confidence in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Journal Friday quoted Finance Secretary Edgardo
Espiritu as saying that the government's 750 million dollar bond
offering in the U.S. market drew subscriptions totaling 2.5
billion dollars, or three times more than the package.
</P>
<P>
The response of the international market to the Philippine bond
proves the return of investor confidence in the Philippines, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The 1 billion dollars of bonds was bigger than the 750 million
dollars the market had been expecting, and was equally split into
two tranches. The first was an increase to the Philippines'
existing April 2008 bond, while the second was a new 20-year bond.
</P>
<P>
The bond was priced by lead managers J.P. Morgan, Morgan
Stanley Dean Witer and Warburg Dillon Read during New York trading
Thursday, local newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
The deal was the first from a Southeast Asian country since the
start of the Asian crisis, and fueled the hope that other Asian
borrowers may soon be able to raise funds in the market.

PRAGUE, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Visiting German Foreign Minister
Joschka Fischer and his Czech counterpart Jan Kavan said here
Thursday that the two countries should further strengthen their
bilateral links and bring traditional cooperation to a new level.
</P>
<P>
No outstanding issues exist between the two countries, the two

economic and trade cooperation is moving along smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Fischer reiterated that Germany, which took over the rotating
European Union (EU) presidency on January 1, supports the Czech
Republic's efforts to join the EU. The Czech Republic and five
other countries -- Poland, Hungary, Estonia, Slovenia and Cyprus
-- started EU membership negotiations last November.
</P>
<P>
Fischer arrived here Wednesday for a two-day visit, during
which he also met with Czech Prime Minister Milos Zeman and
Chairman of the Chamber of Deputies (Lower House) Vaclav Klaus.
The two sides agreed that Zeman will pay a visit to Germany in
March.
</P>
<P>
The two neighboring countries have been developing an overall
relationship during the past several years, especially after the
signing of a joint declaration of reconciliation in January 1997
to solve historical issues and to normalize bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
On the economic front, Germany has replaced the former Soviet
Union as the largest trading partner of the Czech Republic,

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Looks Ahead to Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia is preparing squads
in eight sporting disciplines for the Sydney Olympics, an
official of the country's sports governing body KONI said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The eight squads, which include boxing, weightlifting, ya
chting, badminton, taekwondo, athletics, tennis and beach
volleyball, represent the country's hopes for a medal chase based
on their good records set at the last Asian Games in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
"However, we can't confirm their inclusion in the team because
they still have to pass the qualifying events in order to go to
Sydney," said M. Hindarto, chief de mission of the Indonesian
contingent to Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
He called on the sports federations to prepare as early as
possible for the qualification series programmed by the
International Olympics Committee (IOC).
</P>
<P>
Some of the sports will have joined the qualification rounds
as early as March, he was quoted by the Indonesian Observer
Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
M.F. Siregar, an official of the Indonesian Badminton
Federation, said that the federation had listed a number of
players including Ricky Subagja and Rexy Mainaky, gold medalists
at the Asian Games, mixed doubles pair Trikus Heryanto and
Minarti Timur, and Hendrawan and Taufik Hidayat.
</P>
<P>
Taufik is one of the Indonesian athletes who received
financial aid from IOC under the program of Olympics Solidarity.
</P>
<P>
Other Indonesian hopefuls are the mixed pairing of Zelin
Resiana and Bambang Supriyanto. Siregar jokingly appealed to Joko
Supriyanto to delay Zelin's pregnancy in order that his wife can
"do her duty".
</P>
<P>
Taekwondo, whose contribution at the Asian Games ended up in
silver medals, is currently preparing 24 nominees, who are
undergoing their training in three towns -- Batam, Yogyakarta and
Surabaya.
</P>
<P>
The athletes were between 16 to 24 years old, who are expected
to reach their peak at the Sydney Olympics, said general
secretary of Indonesian Taekwondo Association Zarkasih Hamid.
</P>
<P>
The weightlifting federation will nominate five weightlifters
for the four-yearly world multi-sport event.
</P>
<P>
"We remain hopeful for the Olympics particularly in women's
events," said Djoko Pramono, general secretary of the
weightlifting federation.

<HEADLINE> Colombia's Peace Talks Snubbed by Absence of Rebel Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN, COLOMBIA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The
peace pledge of Colombian President Andres Pastrana on Thursday
was snubbed by a top rebel leader's absence from talks which may
have ended a 50-year conflict that claims thousands of lives eve
ry year.
</P>
<P>
"The time for peace has arrived and nothing will be able to
detain it. I have come to San Vicente del Caguan as the head of
state to keep my word," said President Pastrana, sitting alone
beside an empty seat reserved for Manuel Marulanda, the founder
of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), who has not
been seen in public in decades.
</P>
<P>
"Manuel Marulanda Velez' absence is no reason not to go ahead
with the installation of a dialogue table and the setting of an
agenda of talks leading toward peace," said Pastrana, who later
declared the formal opening of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, speaking on the RNC TV network, rebel commander
Raul Reyes said Marulanda could not come due to unspecified
"threats against his life."
</P>
<P>
So far, the parties have not yet set an agenda and the FARC is
at its strongest ever with over 15,000 men who control about 40
percent of the countryside.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana's statement was made after a rebel commander, Joaquin
Gomez, spoke in Marulanda's place, reading an angry speech
blasting years of alleged government duplicity in past peace
proposals.
</P>
<P>
The speech, signed by Marulanda, also slammed Pastrana for
creating what the rebel head said were new counter-guerrilla
battalions with U.S. anti-drug aid totaling 290 million U.S.
dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
More than five months ago, Pastrana went to Marulanda's jungle
hideout to push the third government attempt to reach peace with
the FARC after failed efforts at the start of 1980's and the
1990's.
</P>
<P>
Marulanda's conditions for peace include dismantling
pro-government paramilitary groups and the exchange of over 250
jailed rebels for more than 350 police and soldiers captured
since 1996.
</P>
<P>
The rebels who have refused a cease-fire or any other
concessions, plan to implement sweeping agrarian reforms, radical
wealth redistribution and an end to free-market economic policies.
</P>
<P>
The FARC is being accused by Washington and the Colombian
government of using funds from the drug trade to finance their
operations. The rebels are believed to earn over 790 million
dollars a year from drug trafficking, kidnapping and extortion.

<HEADLINE> Taihu's Water Quality Improves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Central and local governments
will not relax efforts to clean up the nation's third-largest
freshwater lake, even though major industries are no longer
discharging excessive pollutants into the Taihu Lake.
</P>
<P>
A majority of enterprises required to meet stricter national
environmental standards before January 1 completed their
pollution-control projects, meeting the country's goal, according
to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Random inspections during the past week revealed all pollu
tion-control equipment were functioning well, and no covert
discharging was happening, the paper quoted an official with the
State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) as saying.
</P>
<P>
More than 90 percent of the 770 enterprises ordered to improve
their environmental protection facilities completed treatment
projects, Huang Youzhang, with the Jiangsu Provincial
Environmental Protection Bureau, said.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government vows to monitor enterprises'
discharges, and violators will either be fined or closed down
until they improve their facilities, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang Province is undertaking similar measures to restrict
the amount of pollution discharged into the lake, notes
provincial official Shi Jianrong.
</P>
<P>
Taihu's water quality is better than it was this time last
year, Shi said, adding however, more must be done, including
construction of additional treatment plants.
</P>
<P>
The central government is planning a regional meeting this
month to outline experiences during the first-phase of the lake's
cleanup, notes Qiao zhiqi, SEPA's director of pollution control.
</P>
<P>
These experiences could be used as a basis for treating other
bodies of water in China, Qiao said.

ISLAMABAD, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban are
reported to have released another 264 prisoners of war (POWs) of
the opposition under a decree of Taliban supreme leader Muhammad
Omar in respect of Eird-ul-Fitr, a major Muslim holiday which
comes after Ramadan.
</P>

According to a report Thursday by Radio Shariat, out of the 264
POWs, 200 were released from Pul-e-Charkhi Prison while the rest
were released from Kunduz Prison.

The Taliban have freed the opposition's prisoners of war
unilaterally and without any agreement, the report said. It was
the fourth time the Taliban authorities have released the POWs of
the opposition in respect of Eid-ul-Fitr.

The report said that intelligence officials of the Taliban
authorities visited the prisons and ordered the release of

<HEADLINE> Obligatory Schooling for Migrants' Children in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, January 8 (Xinhua) -- As ten-year-old Zhang Lili was
reading her textbooks in a primary school in Anhui Province in
east China, no one could have imagined that only five months ago
she had left school in her home in the coastal province of Zheji
ang because she had traveled with her parents who were working in
Anhui.
</P>
<P>
Zhang's parents are among China's increasing number of
migrants to urban areas due to the ongoing establishment of a
market economy.
</P>
<P>
These migrants find it hard to register their children in a
local school because of China's residence registration
regulations. If these temporary students, all without
registration cards, are pouring into local schools, the teaching
staff are unable to cope.
</P>
<P>
This social problem was brought to the government's attention
and a new regulation was issued early last year by the Ministry
of Education and the Ministry of Public Security, requiring local
governments to guarantee education for migrants' children aged
between 6 and 14 and who have lived for more than six months in
the area.
</P>
<P>
The city of Hefei, for instance, has thus solved the schooling
problem for 6,000 children like Zhang, which represents more than
90 percent of the total number in the region.
</P>
<P>
The two cities of Shanghai and Shenzhen, located in the east
and south of China, have the largest number of migrants, with
children in need of education totalling 14,000 and 110,000
respectively. Now, many private schools have been set up to ease
the pressure on the government. Twenty-five schools, handling
14,000 migrant children, have been opened in Shenzhen, where the
number of "outsiders" has reached 2.7 million, some 70 percent of
the city's total population.
</P>
<P>
But the pressure remains, with an imbalance between the
increasing number of migrants across China and the limited number
of schools available for their children. An official in Anhui's
provincial educational sector said that a cross-regional
educational network should be set up to tackle the problem.

<HEADLINE> NBA Ratifies Deal, Promises Fan-Friendly League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The NBA on Thursday revealed
plans to become more fan-friendly as its Board of Governors
unanimously ratified the new six-year collective bargaining
agreement.
</P>
<P>
While remaining vague about some of the particulars of the
deal-- which still is about a week to 10 days from being
formalized -- NBA commissioner David Stern and deputy
commissioner Russ Granik announced teams would have open workouts
and marquee TV games would remain on the schedule.
</P>
<P>
The league will have a schedule of approximately 50 games per
team that likely will begin February 5, with each team playing
about five of six games out of conference. The playoffs will
remain the same 16-team format and will begin approximately May
1, running to the last week in June.
</P>
<P>
Stern said each team will have open workouts, play a pair of
fan-friendly exhibition games and offer discounted tickets of $10
by next season at the latest.
</P>
<P>
"There are many people who say the proof will be in the
pudding and the surveys we have say there are many fans who will
remain NBA fans," Stern said. "We are comfortable that if we work
hard, our fans will give us the opportunity to redeem ourselves."
</P>
<P>
"We owe a lot of our fans, and we plan to work with our
players and the NBA to win back the fans' loyalty and trust,"
union executive director Billy Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
One day after the union voted overwhelmingly for the
late-night deal struck by Stern and Hunter, owners voted 29-0 to
ratify the deal.
</P>
<P>
"We're extremely pleased that we have a ratified agreement
with the union," said Stern, who was joined at a news conference
at a midtown hotel by Granik and Hunter.
</P>
<P>
The lockout will not officially end until the agreement has
been finalized, but team facilities will open to players and trai
ners Monday and training camps will officially open no later than
January 18.
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely going to favor either the players or the
teams," Stern said. "I'm sure it is going to be a mad scramble.
These things have a way of working themselves out. It will
probably be combination in different cities."
</P>
<P>
With each team playing 50 games over a period of less than
three months, teams will be forced to play on three consecutive
nights on occasion. The league will average more than eight games
per night.
</P>
<P>
In order to placate NBC and Turner, which paid $23 million to
each team this season as part of their telecast agreement with
the league, some marquee interconference matchups will be
retained.
</P>
<P>
"If teams have to play three in a row, I don't think that is
intolerable," Granik said. "There will some interconference
games, but a team from the East will only play five or six teams
from the West and vice versa."
</P>
<P>
Stern indicated that there would be at least one game on TNT
on February 5 and a doubleheader on February 7 on NBC.
</P>
<P>
"Our broadcast partners are more interested in rescheduling
than they are about money," Stern said. "We anticipate we will
add games to both NBC and TNT. On NBC, it probably be done if we
extend the regular season.
</P>
<P>
"On TNT and TBS, we will look for key matchups and add
additional games along the way. Everything is on the table."
</P>
<P>
Stern also revealed: "Starting next year, we will assure that
fans are getting a chance to attend games for $10," he said. "We
are not going to charge for exhibition games. We will also open
up at least one scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
"We are painfully aware of the beating that professional
athletes and teams have taken at the hands of the public. We have
talked about changing the paradigm. We have talked to teams about
understanding the history and what is going on. This is the next
step in that process. I ask you to judge us in a year."

WASHINGTON-- U.S. President Bill Clinton will ask Congress to
approve about 7 billion U.S. dollars over the next six years to
develop a limited U.S. defense against ballistic missiles, New
York Times quoted administration officials as saying on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that the funds would be sought next month
as part of the proposed fiscal year 2000 defense budget, but that
Clinton was unlikely to decide on any deployment of the system
until at least June 2000. (US-Missile)

<HEADLINE> Governor Rule in Sindh Province to Continue: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif said Thursday the governor's rule in Sindh province will
continue till the objectives are achieved and law and order
situation is improved there.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said his government is determined to
eliminate terrorism from the southern port city and commercial
center of Karachi, and the military courts have been established
to provide speedy justice.
</P>
<P>
Sharif made these remarks during an informal chat with a group
of Islamabad-based journalists at the prime minister's house,
according to a report by the Associated Press of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
About the governor's rule imposed at the end of October last
year, Sharif said that the action had become imperative because
terrorists had made Karachi hostage, crippled the national economy
and killed innocent people as well as those who had rendered
invaluable services to the nation.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said that after the establishment of the military courts
in Karachi in mid November 1998, terrorists were being punished
for the first time. The government will not come under pressure
from any quarters regarding operation against the terrorists, he
added.
</P>
<P>
According to the prime minister, the cases of those already
involved in terrorism, land-grabbing, extortion, murders, and
terrorism are being transferred to the military courts after
thorough investigation.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also said that his government's focus was to
restore normalcy in Karachi and confidence of the investors to
improve economic condition of the country.

<HEADLINE> Bus Service Not to Help Improve Pak-India Ties: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz said that a proposed bus service between Pakistan and
India means to provide relief to visitors and should not be taken
as a measure to enhance bilateral ties with India.
</P>
<P>
Talking to newsmen at a local function in honor of Muslim
diplomats in Pakistan Thursday night, Aziz said "Kashmir solution
is the only key to put Pakistan-India bilateral ties on track."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Kashmir policy would not be changed at any
cost and relations with India would not normalize till the
settlement of the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
He said that reciprocal or unilateral releasing Indian
fishermen from Pakistani jails should also not be taken as a
measure to improve ties with New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
"This is a human issue and we do not believe to keep these poor
fellows for years and years in the jails on violating the
country's sea boundaries", he said.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan has not shift in its foreign policy as far as India
is concerned but exchange of views or measures like bus service,
fishermen or trade are confidence building measures to resolve
differences, especially the core issue of Kashmir with India," he
noted.

<HEADLINE> Canada Helps Central American Countries Overcome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Canada announced Thursday that it
will provide 8 million Canadian dollars(5.28 million U.S.dollars)
to help central American countries affected by Hurricane Mitch
last year to make payments on their international debts.
</P>
<P>
The contribution will be made to the World Bank Central America
Emergency Trust Fund (CAETF), which has been established to help
Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala and El Salvador pay their debts to
international financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
"Canada's contribution to this Trust Fund will enable these
governments to use more of their own funds to rebuild their
countries, which were shattered by Hurricane Mitch," said
International Cooperation Minister Diane Marleau in a release.
</P>
<P>
Hurricane Mitch has destroyed significant agricultural
production, which will severely reduce export earnings in 1999 and
beyond for these countries. At the same time, they are facing
considerable import needs for reconstruction and to meet the
demand for food, medicines and fuel, said the release.

<HEADLINE> Blue-Chips Mixed at New York Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Blue-chips at the New York
Stock Exchanges were mixed Thursday. The dow Jones industrial
average and the Standard &AMP; Pool's 500 Index lowered slightly while
Nasdaq rose a bit.
</P>
<P>
The Dow slid in the morning and dropped 86.51 at 9,458.46 in
early afternoon from the record closing high of 9,544.97
Wednesday. But the Dow closed at 9,537.76 with a loss of only 7.21
points because of a last-minute rally partially fueled by bank
shares.
</P>
<P>
The Dow's early fall was driven by a recommendation given by
the well-know market analist Abby Joseph Cohen of Goldman Sachs
that investors trim their stock investments.
</P>
<P>
Cohen suggested this morning that investors trim the equities
portion of their portfolios by 2 percent to 70 percent from 72
percent and at the same time add to their bond investments because
stocks, she said, were overvalued.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index was also down 2.61 at 1,269.73
in the close of trading. But the technology-heavy Nasdaq was up
5.23 at 2,326.09 and American Stock Exchange Index rose 2.51 at
703.98 as well.
</P>
<P>
The other reason for the slump in a number of blue-chips was
Brazil's economic trouble. Minas gerais, the third-wealthiest
state of the Latin American country, declared a 90-day moratorium
on federal debt payment Wednesday. The news dampened enthusiasm of
the U.S. investors because Brazil is an important importer of U.S.
goods.
</P>
<P>
The bad news from Brazil also drove U.S. dollar down against
most currencies. In late trading at the New York Foreign
Exchanges, the European single currency, euro, was quoted at
1.1670 U.S. dollars, up from 1.1592 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The dollar was quoted at 111.04 Japanese yen late Thursday,
down from 112.66 yen. The British pound was quoted at 1.6513
dollars, down from 1.6556 dollars.

<HEADLINE> UK Presses for WTO Resolution of Banana Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Kingdom government
said on Thursday that it was pressing the World Trade Organization
(WTO) for a resolution of the banana dispute between the European
Union (EU) and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) said in a statement
that the European Union, supported by Britain, will next week
request that the WTO examine the EU's own revised banana import
regime to establish definitively whether it breaks WTO rules.
</P>
<P>
"The British government's efforts... are directed towards
having the whole issue of banana imports referred back to the
proper adjudication process within the World Trade Organization,"
British Trade Minister Brian Wilson said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
A key WTO meeting on the dispute is scheduled for January 12.
Latin American and Carribean countries will also be involved in
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The United States accuses the EU of failing to comply with a
1997 WTO ruling which found its banana import policy favored
former colonies in the Caribbean at the expense of Latin American
producers and U.S. marketing companies.
</P>
<P>
Washington says the new EU regime is little changed and still
does not conform to WTO rules, and has announced it will impose
massive tariffs on a range of EU goods from March.

<HEADLINE> Largest U.S. Bank Offers Fingerprint Access to Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Bank of America, the largest
bank in the United States, has initiated a fingerprint-based smart
card biometric program to give individuals access to their online
banking services.
</P>
<P>
"Biometric technology is becoming increasingly accessible, and
we believe it will play a growing role in security and
authentication for financial products, services and transactions
in the new millenium," the bank said in a statement Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Before using the system, the bank stores a customer's online
banking login, passcode and fingerprint on the chip attached to a
multi-application smart card. The customer then follows a
customary login process to access banking information over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
The biometric security authentication is completed when the
customer places a finger on a small scanning device attached to a
personal computer. The software matches it against the image
already stored on the smart card's chip. Finally the customer gets
onto the the web page for the bank's PC Load smart card program,
from where he can transfer value from his checking account onto
the Visa Cash stored value application on his smart card.
</P>
<P>
The bank first started testing smart cards more than four years
ago and has a special group that explores new ways to utilize the
technology. Out of that group has come the first multi-application
smart card program utilizing Visa Cash and non-finance features
and the first PC program for Visa Cash stored-value chip cards.
The group has also deployed a variety of smart-card programs for
companies and public facilities across the country.
</P>
<P>
"Biometric technology -- coupled with smart cards -- has the
potential to take security, convenience and versatility to another
level for our customers," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Bank of America now provides financial products and services to
30 million households and two million businesses in the United
States. More than one million of the bank's customers bank online
via the Internet, America Online or personal financial management
software.

<HEADLINE> ECB's Interest Rates Remain Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN January 7 (Xinhua) -- President of the European Central
Bank (ECB) Wim Duisenberg said Thursday evening that ECB left the
interest rates unchanged.
</P>
<P>
"I see no tendency that could force us to change interest rates
in the near future," Duisenberg said after the first board meeting
of the ECB since the single European currency was launched on
January 1.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the latest round of interest cuts by
European central banks prior to the launch of the single currency,
the euro, had left no more scope for further rate cuts.
</P>
<P>
The ECB last month set the key interest rate for Euroland at 3
per cent. The ECB also announced that as a transitory measure, the
deposit rate will be initially set at 2.75 percent and the
marginal lending rate at 3.25 per cent.
</P>
<P>
As of 21 January, the rates for these lending facilities will
be set at 2 percent and 4.5 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Duisenberg said that the launch of the euro era had proceeded
smoothly in the financial sector and was "to our satisfaction".

<HEADLINE> U.S. Demands Iraq to Let UNSCOM Back for Arms Inspections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Thursday that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein should allow U.N.
weapons inspectors back for their mission before sanctions against
Iraq could be considered.
</P>
<P>
"it's Mr Saddam Hussein who wants to have sanctions lifted, and
he's not going to have sanctions lifted if UNSCOM isn't able to go
in there, do its job, and come out and certify that Iraq has been
disarmed," State Department spokesman James Foley told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has refused to let UNSCOM, responsible for destroying
weapons of mass destruction in Iraq under U.N. resolutions, back
in its present form after U.S. and British Bombing raid in
December 16-19 on its defense and security sites, thus leaving the
future of the weapons inspection system in limbo.
</P>
<P>
"We can live with the status quo. It's not perfect. We would
like to see an effective UNSCOM going back in there but we're not
panting to have it go back," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Republican Representative Porter Goss, chairman of
the House Intelligence Committee, has asked CIA Director George
Tenet to appear some time this month at testify in a unusual
public hearing on the effect of the U.S. air strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In a letter, released on Thursday, Goss posed three pages of
questions, saying he wanted to know if the four-day air strikes
weakened or strengthened Saddam Hussein's hold on power.
</P>
<P>
Another question was what U.S. intelligence could do to support
the administration's goal of "dismantling the Iraqi regime."

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leonean President Ahmad Tejan
Kabbah said Thursday that he had reached a cease-fire agreement with rebel
leaders, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in capital Freetown, Kabbah said that both
parties had ordered an immediate cease-fire in the capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
If conditions were met for seven days, the statement noted, he would
authorize the release of rebel leader Foday Sankoh, who was sentenced to
death for supporting the coup which ousted Kabbah in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah told a press conference held at Freetown's Lungi airport that he
and Sankoh had agreed to implement an accord signed in 1996 in Cote d'Voire
on ending the civil conflicts in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, Sierra Leonean Finance Minister James Jonah conceded
that the rebels controlled parts of Freetown's eastern and central sections.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that the west African peace-keeping force ECOMOG was
in control of all "major strategic points" in the capital city and
maintained that the rebels never made a "dent in the western area."
</P>
<P>
An ECOMOG spokesman also said that "we are still maintaining our
position ensuring perfect security within Freetown."

<HEADLINE> Foreign Companies Vie to Tap Romanian Oil Market Niches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Foreign oil companies, running
neck and neck with Petrom national company of Romania, are poised
to extend the network of their petrol stations in the territory.
</P>
<P>
According to a Thursday report the fuel chain currently owning
66 petrol stations in Romania, thinks big, aiming at places that
so far have been out of its reach.
</P>
<P>
Shell routinely invests more than a million US dollars in the
construction of one petrol station. Notwithstanding its relatively
high prices compared to other operators', the company's sales have
reportedly gone up, given the good-reputed quality of the
products.
</P>
<P>
Mol company for its part announced intention to set in place 12
petrol stations in the country. The company will also build up two
terminals for fuel loading.
</P>
<P>
Mol executives said the investment would amount to 17 million
US dollars. So far they said the company has poured 25.9 million
US dollars in Romania and expected to bring in more than 80
million by the year 2002, enough for adding 80 new stations to
company's current distribution array.
</P>
<P>
Lukoil is optimistic after its designers completed a 40 petrol
stations blueprint, due to be implemented in 1999. Lukoil has set
sight on the Petrotel refinery, 60 km north of Bucharest, which it
said would endow with modern oil processing equipment.
</P>
<P>
Lukoil wants to boost the kerosen production capacity in an
attempt to give Romania the upper-hand among the fuel suppliers of
aviation companies.

It was the first time in the U.S. since the trial of Andrew
Johnson in 1868 that senators were asked to try a president.
</P>
<P>
On December 19 last year, the U.S. House of Representatives
passed on largely party-line votes two articles of impeachment
against Clinton alleging he committed perjury and obstructed
justice in trying to cover up his relationship with Monica
Lewinsky, a White House intern.
</P>
<P>
The votes sent the issue to the Senate, where a two-thirds
majority must vote to convict Clinton in order to remove him from
office.
</P>
<P>
The Senate had yet to make major decisions on how to proceed
with the case, and whether to permit witnesses. Senate Republicans
said votes could be held later on Thursday on Democratic and
Republican proposals for trial procedures, with the trial itself
resuming next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The White House's expression of concern was its most explicit
challenge to the Senate's conduct of the trial. It marked a
departure from the deference the White House has shown to the
Senate because of its broad authority in determining how the trial
is run.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Iraq's Basra Oil Refinery under Repairing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Thursday that Iraq was repairing its oil refinery at Basra damaged
in December's air raid by U.S. missiles, and it would be back in
operation in a month or two.
</P>
<P>
"They are trying to repair that," said Anthony Zinni, commander
of the U.S. Central Command responsible for the December 16-19
bombing raid against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We had not thought we would take it out permanently. I think
over a period of time they will get it back up. I estimate a month
or two," he told a news conference at the Foreign Press Club.
</P>
<P>
He said the attack on the Basra facility was aimed at
interrupting the illegal smuggling of gas oil.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen said previously that Iraq used
the Basra facility to process and smuggle oil in violation of the
U.N. program that allows the country to export up to 5.256
billion U.S. dollars oil every six months for food and medicine.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Companies Vie to Tap Romanian Oil Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Foreign oil companies, running
neck in neck with Petrom national company of Romania, are poised
to extend the network of their petrol stations in the territory.
</P>
<P>
According to a Thursday report of Rompres news agency, Shell,
the largest private fuel chain currently owning 66 petrol stations
in Romania, thinks big, aiming at places that so far have been out
of its reach.
</P>
<P>
Shell routinely invests more than a million U.S. dollars in the
construction of one petrol station. Notwithstanding its relatively
high prices compared to other operators', the company's sales have
reportedly gone up, given the good-reputed quality of the
products.
</P>
<P>
Mol company for its part announced intention to set in place 12
petrol stations in the country. The company will also build up two
terminals for fuel loading.
</P>
<P>
Mol executives said the investment would amount to 17 million
U.S. dollars. So far they said the company has poured 25.9 million
U.S. dollars in Romania and expected to bring in more than 80
million by the year 2002, enough for adding 80 new stations to
company's current distribution array.
</P>
<P>
Lukoil is optimistic after its designers completed a 40 petrol
stations blueprint, due to be implemented in 1999. Lukoil has set
sight on the Petrotel refinery, 60 km north of Bucharest, which it
said would endow with modern oil processing equipment.
</P>
<P>
Lukoil wants to boost the kerosen production capacity in an
attempt to give Romania the upper-hand among the fuel suppliers of
aviation companies.

<P>
LONDON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Kingdom said on
Thursday that it was trying to make contact with six Britons who
have been detained in Yemen.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Office said it had been informed by the Yemeni
authorities earlier in the day that six Britons had been detained.
</P>
<P>
"As soon as we were informed, our consul-general sought the
earliest possible access to the men. This has yet to be granted
but efforts to see the men will be strongly maintained at the
highest levels," a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Yemen's interior minister was on Wednesday quoted as saying
that an eight-man Western sabotage gang had been arrested in Aden.
He said seven of them carried British passports.
</P>
<P>
Three Britons and an Australian were killed last week when
Yemeni troops stormed the hide-out of kidnappers who had seized 16
western tourists.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday two British detectives probing the deaths were
told to leave Aden and were later allowed to go on with their
investigation.

<HEADLINE> Congo(K) Calls on Security Council to Denounce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- A senior diplomat from
Congo(K) on Thursday called upon the U.N. Security Council to
denounce invasions of Rwanda and Uganda into his country and to
ask both of the countries to immediately pull their troops out of
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Andre Kapanga, permanent representative of Congo(K) to the
United Nations, told a press conference that "The silence of the
Security Council on this issue has encouraged the two invading
countries in their obstinacy to occupy Congolese territory."
</P>
<P>
"This occupation certainly has its price," he said, citing "a
systematic pillage of Congolese minerals in occupied territories,
a destruction of the Congolese rain forest whose timber is
methodically being sent to Uganda en masse, and the killing of
innocent civilians throughout the areas occupied by the Rwandan
and Ugandan forces."
</P>
<P>
"My Government has repeatedly asked the United Nations Security
Council to vigorously condemn both Rwanda and Uganda for violating
the territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
to ask both Rwanda and Uganda to immediately withdraw their troops
from the Congolese territory, to put an end to the violation of
the human rights of the Congolese people who are under the
territory they are occupying," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kapanga wrote a letter to the Security Council, but he
complained the council is yet to make any response, saying that
the Security Council, in charge of peace and security in the world
under the U.N. Charter, should pay real attention to the conflicts
in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Congolese envoy accused both Rwanda and Uganda
of their refusal to participate in regional peace efforts, saying
that the two countries are not interested in peace, "what they are
interested in is the minerals of the Congo, and timber of the
Congo."
</P>
<P>
Rwanda and Uganda first denied their involvement in the
conflicts of Congo (K), but three months after the war started in
August last year in eastern Congo (K), "both Rwanda and Uganda
acknowledged their direct involvement in the war since its
beginning," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Tutsi-led forces, backed by Rwanda and Uganda, rose up in
August last year in the eastern part of the country to topple the
government headed by President Laurent Kabila, who came to power
in May 1997 after a military campaign across the country, then
Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Kapanga also asked the United Nations and the Security Council
to investigate the massacre of about 500 civilians in Makobola,
east Congo (K). Before long, Angola, Namibia and Zambia sent their
troops into Congo (K) to fight along with President Kabila against
rebels.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who had read reports of the
alleged massacre with deep concerns, on Wednesday issued a
statement, voicing his "strong condemnation" of the mass killing
in the African country.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General believes there can be no military
solution to the conflict," the statement said, "He will continue
to actively support current regional efforts to broker a
ceasefire, the withdrawal of foreign troops from the territory of
the DRC, and a broadening of the democratic space in the country,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
The massacre, if confirmed, will appear to be the largest mass
killing since the start of the August 1998 rebellion. Those
killings, never fully investigated, had their roots in the
region's bitter ethnic conflict between the Tutsi and Hutu, and in
the massacre of more than half a million Tutsi in Rwanda in 1994.

<HEADLINE> European Leading Markets End Lower By Profit-taking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON January 7 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets lost ground
Thursday on a wave of profit-taking despite Asia's rally overnight
and the rate cut in Britain and Demark.
</P>
<P>
The UK's FTSE 100 index closed 0.8 percent lower as
profit-taking and a weak start to New York trading outweighed a 25
basis point cut in UK interest rates.
</P>
<P>
By the close, the index which surged to a near record high
Wednesday had fallen 47.6 points to 6101.2, having been down as
much as 106 points just after Wall Street opened.
</P>
<P>
Bank and telecom stocks which led the upward in the previous
session were the main targets of profit-takers. Abbey National,
NatWest, BT and Cable &AMP; Wireless were among the most notable
fallers in the two sectors.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said leading UK stocks, like their U.S.
counterparts, were ripe for profit-taking after a record liquidity
driven jump on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"After a day like yesterday I expect we'll see a day of
consolidation today," said Paul Nesbitt, a technical strategist in
the City.
</P>
<P>
The market is still positive about earnings ahead of hard
evidence, he said, and "there is nothing to destroy that
expectation".
</P>
<P>
Frankfurt shares tumbled as profit-taking set in after the
hefty gains made earlier in the week. The Dax index closed 120.41
points lower at 5323.21.
</P>
<P>
Traders said investors were cashing in after the buying
euphoria related to the introduction of the euro and the launch of
the London-Frankfurt stock exchange link.
</P>
<P>
Paris shares fell back, hurt also by profit-taking after three
days of strong gains. The Cac 40 finished 64.15 points lower at
4230.67.
</P>
<P>
"It's only normal that the bourse would consolidate a little
after rising around 7 percent in three days," a trader said.

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean President Reported Safe as Fighting Continues in Free town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leonean President Ahmad Tejan
Kabbah was "well and safe" in a military base near the international
airport in capital Freetown, a report reaching here said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah and members of his family were taken Wednesday by a helicopter to
the military base used by the west African peace-keeping force ECOMOG and
are still there Thursday, said the report.
</P>
<P>
It quoted witnesses as saying that sporadic gunfire continued to rattle
through the city as both sides fought over the central commercial district.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG sources noted that ECOMOG troops had pushed the combined force of
the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) troops and the ex-junta soldiers
back some distance toward the east.
</P>
<P>
But, a witness said that "there have been no major shifts in positions
of both sides" with ECOMOG forces in the west end and the rebels in the
east end.
</P>
<P>
Bodies lay in the streets of the Freetown's rebel-invaded east end
district while a thick pall of smoke was seen rising above east end streets
where the rebels had burnt government and police vehicles, said witnesses.
</P>
<P>
There were few signs of anyone on all the streets in the city early
Thursday except groups of rebels roaming the streets in search of food.
</P>
<P>
A United Nations official was quoted as saying that the rebels were
threatening to attack a key defense force base at Freetown's international
airport in Lungi.
</P>
<P>
Reportedly, rebel commander Sam Bockarie said Wednesday that his men
would only call a halt to the fighting with the ECOMOG troops if detained
rebel leader Foday Sankoh was freed.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh was sentenced to death last October on treason charges after a
coup which overthrew President Kabbah in May 1997. His rebels backed the
military junta that held power until ECOMOG evicted it last February,
reinstating President Kabbah last march.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak to Visit Syria for Talks on Regional Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
is to pay a visit to Syria Friday for talks with his Syrian
counterpart Hafez al-Assad on regional issues, Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders will discuss the current situation in the Arab
world, the stalled Mideast peace process and ways of advancing the
peace march in particular, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace process came to a halt recently
due to Israel's decision to hold early general elections in May.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations between Syria and Lebanon, on the one hand,
and Israel, on the other, have been in a deadlock since early 1996
due to disputes over the future of the Golan Heights, part of
Syrian territory captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will review the Iraqi issue, the Lockerbie crisis
and other issues affecting the Arab world both politically and
economically, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and al-Assad will examine the "distinguished" bilateral
ties and seek ways of further consolidating the relations in
various domains, he added.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and al-Assad frequently exchange visits in a bid to
coordinate stances on regional issues and international affairs of
mutual concern.

<P>
He said the bank has now got legal custody of 90 percent of the various
properties offered as collateral, adding that the properties include
various vehicles, buildings, factories and construction machinery.
</P>
<P>
The official also said over 1.46 million Dollars of the debt owed by the

JOHANNESBURG, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho is to host a four-day
African meeting on protecting the ozone layer, Southern African
Broadcasting Association reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The gathering, organized by Lesotho weather-forecasting department,
will be held in February in Maseru, capital of the mountain kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from 21 English-speaking countries in Africa and the United

department.
</P>
<P>
Ts'eliso Sekoli, senior official in Lesotho weather-forecasting
department, was quoted as saying that the meeting would review progress
African countries had made to implement an international agreement to
safeguard the ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
Sekoli said that Lesotho had been chosen to host the meeting because it
was one of nations in Africa effecting the protocol, which was signed in
the Canadian city of Montreal.
</P>
<P>
He said activities which Lesotho had implemented include distributing
equipment capturing ozone-depleting gas from refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
The ozone layer prevents harmful radiation from the sun reaching the
earth. Recent studies show there are holes in the system created by the
use of certain chemicals.

<HEADLINE> (Updates with more details)  U.S. Supreme Court Justice Presides Over Impeachment  Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 7 (Xinhua) - U.S. Supreme Court Justice
William Rehnquist was sworn in Thursday to preside over the
impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
The step marks the official opening of the Senate trial in
which the 100-member body will serve as jurors, sworn by Rehnquist
to an oath of impartiality.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time in the U.S. since the trial of Andrew
Johnson in 1868 that senators were asked to try a president.
</P>
<P>
Senate President Pro Tempore Strom Thurmond administered the
oath to Chief Justice Rehnquist in which he said: "I solemnly
swear that in all things appertaining to the trial of the
impeachment of President Bill Clinton, now pending, I will do
impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws: So help
me God."
</P>
<P>
Then, Rehnquist, wearing a black robe with gold stripes on the
arms, administered the same oath to all 100 Senate members who
will sit in judgment of the president on two impeachment articles
of perjury and obstruction of justice in the investigation of his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern. The
senators signed their names in an oath book.
</P>
<P>
On December 19 last year, the U.S. House of Representatives
passed on largely party-line votes the two articles of impeachment
against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The votes sent the issue to the Senate, where a two-thirds
majority must vote to convict Clinton in order to remove him from
office.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, 13 prosecutors of the House delivered to the
Senate the two articles of impeachment accusing Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The ceremonial opening came amid intense, last-minute
bargaining over ground rules.
</P>
<P>
Led by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, the 13
Republicans named as prosecutors for the trial walked silently
across the Capitol -- followed by cameras that broadcast the scene
live to the nation -- to deliver the papers.
</P>
<P>
Hyde read the two articles of impeachment against Clinton,
passed by the House just three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The crucial question now is whether to allow witnesses, as
demanded by the House but opposed by Senate Democrats.
</P>
<P>
The White House declared there wasn't a "compelling case" for
ousting Clinton and warned that if Republicans summoned witnesses
"all bets are off" for a speedy resolution of a scandal that has
dominated the country for a year.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Seek 7-billion-Dollar for Missile Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 7 (Xinhua)-- U.S. President Bill Clinton
will ask Congress to approve about 7 billion U.S. dollars over the
next six years to develop a limited U.S. defense against ballistic
missiles, New York Times quoted administration officials as saying
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that the funds would be sought next month as
part of the proposed fiscal year 2000 defense budget, but that
Clinton was unlikely to decide on any deployment of the system
until at least June 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon has spent over 50 billion dollars in the past
decade and concentrated -- with little success -- on developing
anti-missile systems that might protect U.S. troops and specific
targets from attack.
</P>
<P>
The effort has been burdened by technological and other
problems, including five successive test failures of the proposed
theater high-altitude missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
On January 2, Clinton announced that he will seek an additional
12 billion dollars in overall defense spending for the year 2000
as part of a 110 billion dollars boost for the Pentagon between
then and the year 2005.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Jobless Number Falls to 350,000 Last Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The number of applications
for unemployment benefits fell by 22,000 last week to a seasonally
adjusted 350,000, the U.S. Labor Department said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Department said that this number recovered from the week
before when claims recorded the worst increase in six years.
</P>
<P>
The claims had hit an eight-month low of 289,000 during the
week ended Dec. 19, but during Christmas week shot up by 83,000,
the biggest increase since July 1992. Reports from states
suggested that weather including flooding in the Northwest
contributed to the big jump.
</P>
<P>
Economists have been scrutinizing jobless claims for signs that
the global economic slump is impairing U.S. workers. But they
cautioned against reading too much into the volatile weekly
figures until a clear trend has been established.
</P>
<P>
Continuing claims for unemployment insurance rose last week by
121,000 to 2.33 million, also the most since last July.

<HEADLINE> Senior Chinese Diplomat Rebutts U.S. House Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese diplomat
rebutted here Thursday U.S. allegations that the satellite launch
cooperation with China had threatened U.S. national security.
</P>
<P>
Minister-Counselor He Yafei told a press conference at the
Chinese Embassy that a House panel report on this matter was
"absurd and irresponsible."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House Select Committee issued last week a 700-page
report alleging that American companies had offered "help" for the
improvement of Chinese missile technology when China-made Long
March rockets were used to launch U.S.-made satellites.
</P>
<P>
"This absurd and irresponsible conclusion tarnished the image
of the Long-March rocket, and undermined the international
reputation of its manufacturer and launch services provider. At
the same time, it brought unwarranted damage to normal space
commercial cooperation between China and the United States," said
He, who heads the governmental and congressional section in
the Chinese Embassy.
</P>
<P>
The House panel report, as indicated by American officials,
covers a 1995 decision by the Commerce Department approving aid
provided by the Hughes Electronics Corporation to Chinese rocket
scientists. Lessons given by the American satellite manufacturer
had broad applications to ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
He refuted the allegation, asserting that China's rocket
technology has attained maturity after four decades of sustained
development and "there is nothing in American rocket technology
that can alarm Chinese space experts."
</P>
<P>
China launched its first satellite, the DFH-1, with a
Long-March 1 rocket and began offering services for international
commercial launches in 1985. "China's overall launch success rate
was comparable to or even better than that of similar launch
vehicles of other providers," He said.
</P>
<P>
"It is entirely within its capacity to investigate and resolve
its launch failures and improve its technology self-reliantly. In
this connection, Chinese space experts have neither asked for any
'tutorial', nor received any help, from anyone outside China,"
He added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese diplomat confirmed that China and the United States
had a smooth cooperation in commercial satellite launch services
in the past two decades. Three relevant agreements including the
Memorandum of Agreement on Satellite Technology Safeguards, were
signed by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, both sides adopted a series of strict control and
security measures including round-the-clock surveillance by
American security personnel of the satellite to be launched,
presence of American officials at all technical coordination
meetings, prior U.S. governmental approval of all data and
information provided to the Chinese side, obtaining an export
license issued by the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
"China has always adhered to established international
practices, upheld the principle of fairness and openness and
consistently observed to the letter the three governmental
agreements with the United States. The security of U.S.
technology, consequently, has never been called in question,"
He said.
</P>
<P>
Responding to American suspicion that U.S. normal space
commercial cooperation had facilitated the Chinese to upgrade
their missile technology, He said that the vehicle launch and
missiles launch have major differences, and some people in the
U.S. media and Congress "inadvertently or deliberately, blurred
the distinction between needed and innocuous technical
coordination and illegal divulging of sensitive technologies."
</P>
<P>
"In fact the technical data the Chinese launch vehicle party
asked for from the satellite party has never gone beyond what has
been provided for in the document, which is exactly the same as
asked by the U.S. or any other service providers," the Chinese
diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
He believed that a normal commercial activity in the
high-tech field serves the national security, political and
economic interests of both countries. It also helps the building
towards a constructive strategic partnership between China and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
However, he warned that there are some people in the United
States who have been attempting to hold back the process of
improving relationship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion of the 20th anniversary of diplomatic relations
between the two countries, President Jiang Zemin and President
Bill Clinton reaffirmed their commitment to seeking closer ties.
But it is believed that ups and downs on the road ahead could
hardly be avoided.

<HEADLINE> British Military Exercises not Allowed in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The government of Cyprus
Thursday said it would not allow Britain to conduct military
exercises in Akamas, an environmentally unique place in the
western tip of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Government Spokesman Christos Stylianides said in a daily
briefing that negotiations are underway for an alternative site.
</P>
<P>
The British forces in Cyprus are allowed, under the 1960 Treaty
of Establishment, to conduct military exercises in Cyprus each
year.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides said the government's position on the issue shows
its respect for the 1960 Treaty of Establishment.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus Foreign Ministry has succeeded in reducing the
number of troops that will participate in the exercises, scheduled
for Friday.
</P>
<P>
Both local and international environmental organizations are
strongly opposed to the war games in the region and have stepped
up their efforts to make Akamas a national park.

<HEADLINE> Administrative Reforms Kick Off in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese government Thursday
decided to abolish or merge a number of public institutions,
signalling the administrative reform that it promised earlier to
parliament kicked off.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at a weekly cabinet session presided by
President Emile Lahoud Thursday.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Information Minister Anwar Khalil said
the state-run telephone company OGERO will be replaced by Lebanon
Telecom, an institute with sweeping powers, including the
establishment, equipping, investment and maintenance of the
telecommunications sector.
</P>
<P>
Six public departments, including National Institution for
Statistical Services and Studies, Institution for Guranteeing
Lebanese Exports, that existed only on paper, will be closed,
Khalil said.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet also decided to merge the Council for Executing
Construction Projects with the Council for Executing Grand
Projects in Beirut. And the 22 Water Authorities will be reduced
to five.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Development and Reconstruction, a governmental
body which spearheads Lebanon's post-war reconstruction drive
launched by former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, is to be
reorganized, Khalik said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the streamlining move was aimed at
improving public bodies' efficiency and reducing public
expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's new government was formed by veteran politician and
economist Salim Hoss last December after his predecessor Hariri
refused to remain in office.
</P>
<P>
In his policy statement, Hoss put administrative and economic
reforms as the priorities of his government to bring down the huge
public debts and clean up the corruption-riddled government.

<HEADLINE> E. African Development Bank Launches New Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The East African Development Bank (EADB)
 launched here Thursday a new investment instrument in the regional money
market in a bid to help mobilize local investment resources.
</P>
<P>
The so-called Medium Term Note (MTN) issue worth 1.2 billion Shillings
(200 million U.S. Dollars) will have a maximum issue period of 18 months
and will be traded in the secondary market of the Nairobi Stock Exchange,
the bank announced.
</P>
<P>
It will be initially on offer in Kenya and Uganda and later in Tanzania,
said the bank's Director General, Fabian Tibeita.
</P>
<P>
He said that the bank had already secured the approval of the Capital
Markets Authority to trade in the paper.
</P>
<P>
The MTN will have a maturity period of one to five years and bids from
the investing public can be placed with the arrangers, the dealers or the
placing agent.
</P>
<P>
With a term of four years, the notes will be redeemable in eight equal
semi-annual payments and will be issued in denominations of one million
Shillings.
</P>
<P>
The floating rate coupon rate for the first interest payment (for the
period from January 15, 1999 to July 15) has been fixed at 19.08 percent.
</P>
<P>
The debt instrument will be on sale at the NSE from January 15 at a
purchase price of 99.75 percent and its final maturity date will be
January 15, 2003.
</P>
<P>
The bank is one of the few surviving relics of the East African
Community that was dismissed in 1977.
</P>
<P>
The bank now is owned by the three member states of the East African
Cooperation -- Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Coffee Production Drops Further in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Coffee yield in Kenya declined in 1998
for a third running year, according to a report available here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Mild Coffee Trade Association F. J. Mwangi was quoted as
saying that the country's coffee output went down from 97,575 tons
between 1995-1996 to 53,000 tons from 1997-1998.
</P>
<P>
The fall in coffee production, Mwangi said, was attributed to adverse
weather conditions such as the prolonged drought in early 1997 followed by
the massive destruction caused by the El Nino rains.
</P>
<P>
The poor weather resulted in the production of smaller beans mainly in
the major crop growing areas, he noted at a recent general meeting of the
association.
</P>
<P>
"This had a negative effect for high altitude areas but was beneficial
to low altitude areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he added Kenya's coffee continued to do well in the
international market due to its high quality despite of a drop of prices in
 the world market since last July when Latin America saw a bumper harvest.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Factory Orders Rise in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 7(Xinhua) -- The U.S. Commerce Department
said Thursday that new orders to factories rose 0.6 percent in
November to a seasonally adjusted 337 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
It said this was the fifth increase in six months, showing the
U.S. economy was winding up 1998 on a strong note. For the first
11 months of the year, factory orders were 2 percent higher than
the same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
For much of the year, strong gains for computers,
communications equipment and autos have helped offset a drop in
orders to steel mills and a lackluster increase at aircraft
plants, owing to the global economic crisis that began in Asia in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Orders for big-ticket durable goods rose 0.8 percent in
November. They were led by a 9.2 percent rebound in orders for
primary metals such as steel, the first gain in the sector since
August and the strongest in more than four years. Orders for
nondurable goods also rose 0.3 percent, with an increase for
chemical products offsetting a decline in textiles.
</P>
<P>
Economists said orders are a key barometer of future factory
activities.

<HEADLINE> China Favors no Security Council's Involvement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese diplomat
said on Thursday that China, in principle, does not favor the
involvement of the U.N. Security Council in the issue of Kosovo, a
Serbian province in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY).
</P>
<P>
Shen Guofang, deputy Chinese permanent representative to the
United Nations, told Xinhua that "China's stance on this question
remains unchanged."
</P>
<P>
Shen made the statement after the Security Council met on
Thursday afternoon behind closed doors to discuss a report on
Kosovo by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
China, as always, holds that the issue of Kosovo is the
internal affairs of the FRY, and no outside forces can interfere
in the issue.
</P>
<P>
Separatists and terrorists in Kosovo, making use of the
one-sided international pressure imposed on the government of the
FRY, wantonly staged armed violence in the province, thus
destabilizing the area, destroying the process of national
reconciliation and efforts to seek a peaceful solution, and
hindering the return of refugees and the work of international
humanitarian organizations, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese delegation has issued repeated warnings that
parties concerned should make efforts to avoid giving
separatists and terrorists in Kosovo a false impression that
they are being instigated," he said.
</P>
<P>
To his regret, the Kosovar separatists and terrorists really
thought that they have got support from outside, he said.
</P>
<P>
"As far as the Kosovo issue is concerned, the international
community should respect in real earnest the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of the FRY," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Only in this way can it be helpful in getting rid of the
illusions of the separatists and terrorists in Kosovo, in
effectively promoting the process of the political solution to
the question of Kosovo," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Chinese envoy voiced his appreciation of the
efforts by the FRY government in seeking a peaceful solution to
the conflict in Kosovo, saying that "We maintain that any
political solution to the question of Kosovo should not run
counter to the will of the FRY government and its people and the
principle of sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
Conflicts broke out in Kosovo after ethnic Albanians, who make
up some 90 percent of the population in the Serbian province,
seek independence from the FRY.
